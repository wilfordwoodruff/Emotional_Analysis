 [upside-down text]Geo. A. Smith[upside-down text]Washington D C.July 27, 1856Brother Woodruff: As a sunday morn-ing pleasure we sit down to write altho theweather is so hot that our river run like oil.The House of Representatives have refused to passthe Army appropriation Bill, without a provisothat no part of the Army should be used to supportthe Territorial Government in Kansas againstthe Free State party. Two Three weeks now closesthe session and very little can be done to benefitanybody, several hundred private Bills mustbe laid over. The Country is suffering fromsevere drouth. The general cry from all quartersis for rain. The wheat harvest has beenvery abundant. When I first came hereand learned Brother Bernhisel's feelingsI felt quite uneasy and half a notion to ^try to^ pushour Bill into the Senate Dr or no Dr, oneday while ^praying &^ reflecting upon the subject I droppedto sleep on a Soffa and dreamed, that therewas a large train of Cars that I had to startI laid hold of them and pushed with all 
 we should have power to accomplish.I have several times suggestedto the Dr the propriety of our holding prayer-meetings together. The last conversationI had with him on the subject I advisedhim to get some garments, which he doesnot wareear and has no outfit whateverfor a prayer-room; but he replied that hewas like Brother Kimball preferred to do his praying alone. I have since related to himmany circumstances that occurred with youand me on our mission through Michiganin 1844 how the Lord answerd our prayer soastonishingly in the case of M Sirvine sisterWilseys children &c and I think I shallmake a convert of him before next session.He says he asked Joseph in particular if drawersand shirts would not answer as well as garmentsIf cut &c. He is certainly one hitch olderfogy than I am on this subject.He has introduced me to many membersof Congress. He is universally respected by them

 Nauvoo Sund^a^y Evening Nov 9rth 1845Elder Woodruff I seat myself to communicate a few words to you.I have written once to you since our recent difficulties commenced & shouldhave continued to write had not the press of business & excitement pre-vented. We are all making preparations to move beyond the RockyMountains early in the Spring coming. The timber is already gotout for several hundred wagons & a multitude of men at work get-ing more & every thing possible is doing to get ready in good season.The work on the Temple is hurried with all speed, the upper roomsare being plastered & in about 3 or 4 weeks we shall be givingthe endowment to the Elders, the Lord & Governer willing: Everyscheme is in foot to get something against the twelve, Wm Smithis doing all he can in St Louis, & amongst other things he has pub-lished that "the 12 Apostles are very licentious & he for opposingthem has been cut off". He is very bitter, but has very fewfollowers, as the Saints are too well acquainted with his charac-ter to be led astray by him, as his course in the East & in Nauvoo isgeneraly known. The Twelve meet in council every day & prayfor the deliverance of the Saints from bondage, & we are heard by ourFather, & in a great number of instances have been answered to ourown astonishment, Elder Hyde has returned with 4500 yds ofCanvass for the Tabernacle. The Circuit Court went of well,not a single house burner was arrested, & all the brethren whowere charged with crime are discharged; the sheriff was recog-nised for his appearance at court to be tried for the murder ofF A Worrell, his bonds are $3000, he is exercising all the duties of sheriff,& is a brave & patriotic man & the only high officer in the State who haslived ^tried^ to maintain the supremacy of the law. (I have seen a letter from ^Br^ ElderWard to Elder O Hyde, he gave some news; I think his egotism be-speaks a slight touch of the "big head." I hope I am mistaken, but ifI am not, I believe from the Spirit of that letter, it would do himgood to travel over the mountains with us & get another kind ofexperience from that he is called to now, as a change is good, youknow better than I, every man has his own way.) We had to stopthe Nauvoo House on account of the mob. The Governor has 100 menstationed at Carthage to keep the peace as he says, but I say to plague theSaints; they have been still for a few days; All the blacklegs in the 
 country are trying to heap their crimes on us, & nothing but the power ofGod has preserved us this season, & nothing short can keep us here inpeace this Winter; be He hears our prayers every day & deliversus from their hands. We have four peices of cannon & a greatnumber of fifteen shooter rifles & many six shooter pistols & if ac[o]llision should take place with the mob we would stand a goodchance to give them a sound scrubbing; but I feel confident thatwe shall move away without the loss of life. All the brethren areanxious to go & a great many others are going with us. EldersSherwood & John S Fullmer, have been to Emmetts company& baptised them all again, they are now camped on the MissouriRiver above the mouth of the Sioux River about 700 miles from herein the Buffalo country; the Sioux Chiefs are very friendly to them &they get plenty of buffalo hmeat. Monday evening the 10th I havebeen engaged revising the church history with Brs Richards, Young,& Kimball. We read over the letters we wrote to the Times & Seasonswhen in London, this makes us think of Wilford; I find they werebadly printed. I sent a team to day to Quincy for a load of iron to fixup my wagons for Van Couver's Island, Salt Lake or some-where else. Tomorrow Br Heywood is going to make a con-tract with some iron houses for a large amount for the companies;moving is all the talk here. Elder Babbitt has gone to see theleading men in St Louis & Cincinatti to endeavor to makesale of property. We have some encouragement of rentingour Temple to the Romans. I have got 3 yoke of oxen to-wards a team to move with. We shall go principally with oxteams as they will live on grass. We shall cross the mountains at the South pass in 42 Degreses of N Latitude, & start as earlyas possible for cattle to live on grass. Emmigration is rollingin very fast; a company of Saints arrived here last night fromNorthbridge Masss; every house in the city is crowded, ourhouse contains about forty all the time. We have built allround the house I lived in, since you left here. Our towncontains over 11,000 inhabitants, we have above 20,000 peopleto move from this country next Spring, or we must fight amob composed of most of the State, & the Govr says we can-not be protected from mob violence by State authorities 
 the word is, "you must go;" & we are sick of a liberty soterrible, ^&^ freedom so very oppressive. Elder Granthas returned from Philadelphia with his family, allin good health & spirits. I have been improving in myhealth for the past year, my lungs are recovering slowly& are nearly well. Many have died this summer & fallBr Wm Gehan, Br Drollinger, Br Stephen Winchester's sonAlexander, Br John Cheese, Hannah Ells, Olive Frost,John Low, Gen Dunham died last summer in the senecanation, & many others have been called away as the fall hasbeen sickly. Notwithstanding the great amount of grainburnt by the mob, an abundance is among the Saints, to sus-tain them all; the harvest was abundant, every kind of grainis ^in^ great plenty; but the flour mills in our city are notsufficient to do the grinding for the country around.Br Richards has been sick some time, but his health isimproving, this has delayed the history. Novr 12th YesterdayI visited Br & Sister Webster, found them well & in first ratespirits, they said little Wilford was in good health & fine spi-rits, they received a letter from you a short time since [page torn]spent the day in reading the Church history; the eveningwith the council of the 12 engaged in preparing an epistleto the saints at home & abroad concerning our removal & ageneral invitation to all honorable law abiding men to ac-company us. The Bishops bought 100,000 ft of pinelumber for the finishing of the Temple & making wagonboxes. Bathsheba sends love to yourself & your kind lady.I wish to be remembered also. Close by subscribingmyself yours as ever in the bonds of the covenantGeorge A Smith

I have not known of their receiving it, think if they had, I shouldhave known it.  It is very pleasant to me to hear from my friends and more to so to see them.  how much I want to see you allI should be willing to make some sacrifice to spend a few days with you or to see you here,  but it is uncertain when and where we may meet, if not on earth may it be in heavenYou refer to some unkind feelings to ward Utah, I hear of none.  Sin and iniquity abounds to a great extent with us.Our ministers are becomeing political Priests jumping out of the pulpit with politics and from politics jumping into an teasing robing that.  It is new with them bleeding Remsus., in that since it was O. The Pope The Pope, he will have us all murdered 
 Ms 1352 bx 6 fd 28 #12F Carter July 9th 1856Anserdlocated in Historian BookPuttand July 9th 56My dear Sister & BrotherYesterday I rec.d your very kind letter of June 1st, and was glad to hear from you after so long  a time,I dont know, really when I have had a letter before from you, and I fear that you do not get mine,  I was glad to hear that you are quite well,  Mr. Woodruff must have had a very severe attack and his recovery seems quite ProvidentialYou speak of my visiting you, it would afford me great pleasure to do so but when that time will come is quite uncertain.  presume your city has increased very much since I wasthere,  I have quite a number of friends there that I should like to see, Brother Hardy, Smoot, Sister [Cewand] &c. by the way how is Mrs. [Cewand] these days?  please give my regards to her and all of my old friends and acquaintace with you. 
 So they take up one humbug after anotherThey now see that they had much more reason to fear the Devil than they had the Pope,  God works in a mysterious way, and can make the wrath of men to praise HimOh that men would learn to love each other rather than to hate and injure themI was glad to hear the you are all wellEzra, Judith and Annie, have gone out well and will see Rhoda and Fabyan.They were all well a short time since and prospering.  I was at Scenlure, two days since.  Phebe, those grand old elms are as grand and majestic as ever.  When do you think you will see them, and an respected father.  you may see them, but probably not him in this world.Mouther is very poorly is now in N.Yorkunder the care of a Physician.  I think a month or two will determine something with her.  She must be helped to stand it much longer.  Our children are well our friends generally are quite well.  Mary C. Fabyan is merried to a Meth minister Ira Foes was in today done harvesting, can good Potatoes [illegible] , please write often.  I will write again soon, give much love to all..  May God keep us and bless us and may we all meet in heaven is the daily prayer of   Very truly yours [illegible] 
 We are all as well as usual.  Mrs. Carters health continues very poor..  She is now quite feeble but keeps about the most of the time.  Father was in last week and spent some days with us, he is quite well, and cotinues very smart.Aunt Fabyon is as well as usual and our friends generally at [Scenbere,] with no important changes  Mary Fabyanswill probably be married within a week,the third wife of a Methodist ministerMr [Menthen] and family are well and prospering,  I was at Scenbere, a few days since and found it very pleasantWe hear from Illinois occasionally, allquite well there now.  Rhoda is very rugged since she recovered from her severe illness.  Simon is here and in tends to spend the summer on account of his health, which is not very goodIra and family we well.  They have a young Son there which is quite gratifying to them, have quite a little family around them. 
 We shall probably have quite anexciting fall, Politically, Buchanan and Fremont have been nominated for the Presidency.  B. will no doubt be electedBy our late arrivals from Europe we have very favorable prospects that peace between the two countries will be continuedbetween the two countries.  It was feared that the dismissal of the Eng. Minister at Washington and some other misunderstandings would lead to difficulty.  I am sorry to say that many of our leading Politicians of all parties, if possible, are becoming more corrupt than ever, what the result will be we cannot tell, the prospect now is that a dissolution of the Union will take place before many years, whether that would be attended with serious consequences we can hardly tell.  The evil one is very busy and he finds great numbers that he contacts.  Spiritualism is flourishing like a green bery tree, the Devels great and perhaps last harvest. 
 This life, how short it is, compared with the next, and what a world of trial, disappointments and pains, but there is a land of pure delightWhat a great  thing it is to have a treasure in heaven, God be our Fatherand heaven for our home.  That is enoughThis mortel posseses but little attraction to me  on my own account, but we have friends that must be provided for.  How great our occasion for gratitude to God for all His mercies and goodness to us.  I am astonished and pained that I have so little love for Him, but I would love Him with all my heartYou and yours are always  remembered by me in my feeble prayers, and you must remember us in such occasions and if we are not permitted to meet here again upon earth may we and all our dear friends meet where sin and sorrow can never come and parting are [nere] known..  Please remember me very kindly to Mrs. Fess and family and all friends.  Mrs. Carter sends much love to all.  hoping to hear from you oftenI am very truely yours.  I. F Carter

 Washington City June 4, 1856Mr Wildord Woodruff,Dear Sir,Your communications of the 27th of March and of the 9th of April were received on the 31st ultimo.Be pleased to accept my thanks for yourkindness to my family. I presume you are apprized ere this that I have paid Messrs Sanborn & Carter one hundred and five dollars on your account.It is distressing to hear of the suffering among our people in consequence of the scarcity of provisions, and also of the loss of sheep and stock in consequence of the severity of the past winter, and by Indian depredations. The trial through which the church is now passing is doubt-less the most severe that she has ever passed through. Those who endure this chastening of the Lord without 
 apostatising, or murmuring against God, will probably endure to the end.I regret to hear that brother Cain is indisposed.  Will you be good enough to ask him what disposition he has made of my oxen and wagon, and whether he has made any arrangement to have my family supplied with wood during the present summer and the ensuing winter, also whether the two or three loads of wood due for house rent have been paid?This morning I deposited in the post office a bill of lading and bills of goods which I trust will reach you in safety.My wagon containing the goods will start from old winter quarters if it has not already started.  If you cannot raise meawhat means my family may needfrom goods and other sources, you will draw upon me for what they may 
 require. E. Snow & Co. or perhaps any other house would I suppose give you the cash for a small draft payable at one day after sight.I am quite disappointed at the course that Mr. Houtz is pursuing, he has not done as he agreed to do.Have the goodness to let me hearfrom you as often as you can conveniently.Brother Hautz was to kill thirteen hogs in December last, one fourth of them belonged to me, and after supplying my family he was to sell the pork, he was to sell the remander and hand you the money.If he has not done so, will you please to endeavor to collect it. Say to him that my family needs it. Before I left I desired you to pay brother Houtz some eight or ten dollars on account of some little improvements he proposed to make, but you will pay him nothing more, 
 Washington City, April 7, 1856Dear Brother,Inclosed is the receipt of Messrs Sanborn & Carter for one hundred and five dollars.Brother Houtz was to kill thirteenhogs in December, one fourth of which belonged to me, and the pork of which, after delivering as much to my family as they required, he was to dispose of, and pay the proceeds of the sales to you. Has he done so? Have you received any flour from him since you wrote last? Bekind enough to keep me informed how he gets on with the mill.The prospects for the speedy admission of Utah into the Union as a State aredark and gloomy.Yours in the GospelJohn M. BernhiselMr Woodruff.

My mission to Wash-ington appears to be a dull affairSecretary Babbitt left here this morningfor Salt Lake. bBy him I have sent lettersto President Young—My family, yourselfand many others—I write this to send bymail. Our Know Nothing Congress or ratherBlack Republican House of Representativesare a regular Blue Law set of fellows, but theHouse has been occupied ever since I camehere with Kansas quarrels and SumnersCaneing—evry kind of business seems to beat a stand. The House passed a Bill to admit Kansas as a Free State on theConstitution framed last winter. Theydone this for political effect knowing that itcould not pass the Senate. The Senatehave passed a Bill to authorize Kansas to form a Constitution fully believingthat the House would reject their Bill.In this manner our statesmen foolaway from their time and the real business of theCountry rejected; while foolish men quarrel with each other. 
 Since the Black Republicans and oldTom Benton have been makingsuch a muss about Govr Young andUtah & Poligamy President Pierce hasbecome somewhat Bitter in his feelingsat least Dr Bernhisel informs me that thePresidents modest feelings are annoyedwith Govr Young's interfeering with the Juries as set forth inby Bro Brigham in theTabernacle as set forth in the TabernacleFeb 24, 1856 Watts Report of which Mr Piercehas in his possession as published in the52 No of the 5th Volume ^Deseret News^ page 412 where youwill see the President sets forth the rascalityof Courts and Lawyers and to make good his feelings I suppose he has dismissedJoseph L Heywood from Office underthe impression probably that he was toohonest a man to handle Governmentfunds. He sends Judges to Utah andthey make expenses by Tens of thousandsof Dollars & these Judges force the Marshalto stand at the Back of these expenses and the Departments refuse to pay them& cannot conceive how it is possible thatanything should cost more in Utahthan in N. York. Bro Heywood got hisdischarge today. I am about appointinghim private secretary and he hopes 
 that Uncle Sam will at least be aspolite as other men are when theydismiss their hands—pay upToday Dr Bernhisel Introduced me to Mr Andrew Oliver of N. York. He askedme many questions in relation to Utah &seems pleased. He is a Republican of themoderate stripe. He also introduced meto Govr Aiken member from South CarolinaAlso to Mr Cox of Kentucky a Know NothingThe business of the House is conducted insuch noisy style that it is impossible forme to understand half that is going onIn the Senate to day they ^were^ Discussinga Bill for a Road from the South Passto Minnesota Ter. I was surprised in hearingthe debate at the ignorance of ^many of^ the Senators inregard to the mountains & plains.Judge Kinney called on me yesterdayand told Dr Bernhisel & myself  "he hadnot asked President Pierce to appoint himGovr of Utah. His friends had not asked forhim either. He would not permit his friends to ask. hHe did not want the Office. The officehe now had was equally as Lucrative he couldremain at home some time and draw hisSalary without going to Utah, but if PresidentPierce tendered him the appointment without asking he would accept and go to Utah 
 alone without Troops. I can do the duties ofGovernor in Utah. I want no Troops. I donot want the Office I despise do not want the Office when I know the whole people preferGovr Young and I will accept rather as a dutyI owe to the people of Utah rather than havea man appointed who would be liable tomake trouble. Understand me if GovrYoung must be removed and I am tenderedthe Office I shall acccept. He also stated that he believed that Govr Young would beremoved. I write to you not wishingyou to publish my letter because in speakingof men & things Individually they mightcome back in a way so as to prejudicemy influence among the Devils whohave all ^got to^ be influenced to vote over ad-mission into Bedlam or we shall haveto stay out; and last not least hurt Dr Bernhisel'sfeelings" I do expect that if we had not havebeen councelled in the start to confer togetherand act being agreed that Dr Bernhisels non-committal Policy would have got awfully twistedbefore this time. The longer I remain herethe more thoroughly I became convinced that there are no independent men in congress who darestand up for their own principles of non-interventionat the present time or at least that I have notbecome aquainted with any; I have not metany but what seem to shudder at the idea of facing the music now.[sideways text] July 15, 1856Geo.

I will state in relation to Mr.Heywoods Dr[a]ft, that Ezra sent it to a Government officer at Washington, a particular friend of his who presented it for payment which was refused by some management amoung themselves however it was afterwards paid, they not forgetting to reserve their commissions - The evil one seems to control many now to a great extent.  it looks as though we were drawing near to some importent period in the history of the world. Sin, iniquity and abominations reigns almost triumphent,and I think it well that we have our lamps trimed and burning and be with those servents who at their masters comeing shall be found watching 
 We have no news of much interest business has been duller for the past yearthan has scarecely ever been known before we think from present appearances that it will improve this fall.Father spent the week with us past, he continues smart. I was at Scarbure, a few days since, all as well as usual there with no material change.Mr. Carters health is very poor, the children are all well. Ezras family are well. Annais at Andover at boarding school.When may we expect to you see you here. I hardly [alone] ask a question of Mrs. W. or any of our female friends there but think we shall see you sometimeHow glad I should be to spend a week or two with you.Please remember me very kindly to Phebe. (I am expecting a letter from her soon)and your family, suppose that some of your children are quite grown up,  my regards to Ms. Foss and family. I hope E.

I enclosed a little Draft in the young mans Mother in Conn. Ms. Bingham which she declined paying for $105—Not knowing whether you had recdor not, I refer to itI am very sorry to hear that there was a little collision between the soldiers and citizens on Christmas day, for such things are so much magnified and so much talk made about them.I hope you will have no more trouble with them, but be enabled to live in happiness peace and prosperity.

I will try and do better for thefuture. I have enjoyed tolerable health this sumerbut there has been a good deal of sickness in this citybut not so fatle with our people as might of beenreasonably expected. The Lord has been with us andowned the administration of his servants.In consequence of the troubles in Nauvoo our numbershave been greatly increased I believe that there ^are^ verynear 1,000 who profess to be Saints in this place manyof whom are very poor especially among those who havecome down from Nauvoo. since the treaty, we are takingup subscription for them. Since beginning this letter I havereceived 16 dollars for their relief have distributed someof it and some I have loaned to those who think theywill be able to refund it. I intend to try and keep up a fund

 Terre Haute Sept 27th 1837Brother WilfordI received your very kind and interestingLetter dated Rowley Mass. July 25th in its properseason and as you invited my correspondence with youat Scarborough I cannot longer deny myself thepleasure of writing you. In the perusal of the accountof your visit among the friends of our youth I assureyou I can appreciate the emotions by which you musthave been inspired and I should think myself mosthighly favored to be permitted to enjoy with yousuch an occasion. When I think of "My own dearnative land" So many and such varied associationscrowd into my mind that I can hardly determinewhether I should realise more pleasure or painfrom a visit. I have many objects of attaction andendearing interest there but there is one beforewhich all others lose their force it is foundin the magic term "My Sistre"! I have manyfriends who are very dear to me and upon whosememory I often dwell with great delight, yetmy dear brother must forgive me when I saythat the presence of my only sister in mythoughts drives every other object from myreccollection. I sometimes fear she is too muchthe idol of my heart but I pray God thatshe be not doomed to be smitten in judgmentto me. 
 It must have been gratifying to you to meetso much encouragements in your ministry among the bigotry and superstion of Farmington, andbelieve me, brother, tho, I am a wayward childI always rejoice at the success of a humbleministration of the gospel and I am proudto think I have a brother who is not ashamedto proclaim the truth where so little honoris to be expected as in one his own countryI am not ambitious to have my brothers become"able divines of the day" skilled in all thesubtleties of the craft but I shall ever be happyto learn that they are skilful dividers ofthe word of truth and mighty throughGod to the pulling down of the strong holdsof Satan. I have just received letter fromMother. She writes that the Book of Mormana copy of which I left at home is in muchdemand there it is loaned out all of the time and several applications are in advancefor the favor. I was very sorry that itbecame necessary for our people to nowreturn to T... but it was perhaps exp-edient and I hope will prove for the bestShe writes that all are well and thatthey are doing as well as they had reasonto expect Eunice is expected to go home assoon as her school is closed. 
 You talk of going to Missouri this fall but say not a word about visiting me! I cannot thinkdear W. that you can be so unkind as to failvisiting me this fall and I shall insist upon yourmaking Terre Haute a point on your routeto Mo. I should be delighted to see you andSister in Law. And I now promise myself thepleasure before many weeks. I cannot indeedpromise you much entertainment here nor doI imagine you be much pleased with me forto tell you the truth I am getting to be adisagreeable thing and do not improve muchby age, but then, I am your brother [page torn]and this will be some little excuse for youto take a little trouble to see me, besides Iknow your weakness and from this knowledgeam assured you will take a little pridein presenting me to your Phebe, who cannotbe otherwise than what your good tasteand judgment warrants me in presuming.I wrote your at Farmington sometime agoand hope you will get the Letter.I hope you will write me often.With kind wishes to Mrs Woodruff I remain, dear brotherVery Truly YoursAsahel H WoodruffWilford Woodruff

I told her I did not know how thatwould be. Such things had been done but I didnot know how it would be again. Well then ifthat cannot be done I want you to have me sealedto your son Mohonri M Steele (he was then there on a mission) and my Children adopted to him and meand left the matter in my hands to see to it She diedshortly after I left England and I have had her Endow-ments attended to for her but nothing moreNow dear Brother your answer to this questionwould settle the matter and by so doing wouldwould greatly oblidge your Brother in the GospelJohn Steele

 Sabbath Morning February 23, 1833Brother  AsahelI received your line under date of Jan 2nd,& was gratified to learn that you meet with good successin your temporal undertakings. As the business your are employed inappears to prove profitable no doubt but you will do well to perseverein it And I would heartily except of your generous offer in joiningyou in canvassing two or three of these western counties if circumstanceswould permit but I stand in need of more information respecting thesubject before I can decide. You know Brother it is expensive travling5 or 6 months without any incomes & now I would like to know whoyour employers are & whether they reside in York state or Connecticut& how long we must wait for our pay. Was if those who get the subscriberscan review pay of the publishers before the Books are distributed I should thinkit best to get subscribers & let others distribute, but I conclude this is notthe case I expect they advance no funds untill the books are distributed& money collected, & if this is the case probably it would be the safest todistribute to your own subscribers then you will be sure of your pay.There is business sufficient for three of us at holm the coming seasonbut perhaps not to that profit that it would be for me to go into the Bookbusiness. We have some payments coming due in the spring which probably willtake what money we shall have. If I could procure a little money if it wasnot more than $20.00 I think I would take a [trunk] with you in the Springwhich is fast hastening. But at all events I think you will be well to take thoseCounties you spoke of & if you could get Oswego County I could helpyou canvass parts of that without much expense, as it is at holm.Whether I have any part as lat in this matter or not I hope thebusiness will continue to prove as favorable to you as it nowpresents itself And when you receive this line I wish you wouldwrite to me again & let me know the whole particulars of the businessthen I can know better how to calculate. I would like to knowwho your employers are & if those who get the subscribers must distribute theBooks & how long we must wait for our pay &c. I would like toJoin you in the business if I can procure money to pay myexpenses untill I can receieve sumthing for my labour. I dontthink of any thing ^more^ connected with this subject of importance to write.We have written to Brother Thompson & directed ourletter to Farmington stating that we wished him to come out & workwith us as soon as he could settle his business in the spring & if youshould see him let him know of it as he may have been imployedin some other place through the winter & not receieved itI shall live in hopesof seeing you in the spring if you visit this section of countryNB (I wish to be remembered to all enquiring friends Willford) 
 I am glad to hear that you are enjoying so comfortable temporal &Spiritual health. With respect to myself I have enjoyed good health throughthe winter excepting a few turns of the cholic & occasionally a rhoumaticbite but this is not to be wondered at for I should think it would give anyman the cholic to load & draw as many logs as I have thi^s^ winter fromthe shores of Lake Ontario in all kinds of weather however I have gotallmost through with it a few days more will if prospered and a wintersjob. Azmon has been employed most of the week past insleding lumber to Mexico about six miles which he exchanges forhousehold furniture & farming tools we can exchange lumber for any kind of store goods But I have allready gone more than a Sabbathdays Journey in temporal affairs.With regard to spiritual things things conserningthe Kingdom of God & my own soul I would say it would beimpious not to acknowledge the goodness of God in preserving my lifeto the present period finally what a long suffering & patient waiting God weare dealing with at times when I look at my unfaithfulness, unbelief,slow to obey prone to wander & to do evil, heart buried in the rubbish of the world while wasteing my Masters goods I feel ready to exclaim what is manthat Thou art mindful of as the son of man that Thou visitest him. ButI think I have a desire that God will help me to arise & trim my lampthat I may be more prepared for his comeing for he is near even at the doorBrother if you have free access to a Throne of grace remember me in yourpetitions pray that I may know the mind & will of God in Christ Jesus conserningme I have had my mind more than usually impressed for a few dayspast with the subject of the signs of the times this probably was caused by a visitfrom a servant or prophet of the Lord which called at our house hiscommishion is to the house of Israel to warn them to repentance.he professes to belong to no persuasion of people ownly a servent of the livingGod he goes & comes at the biding of his Master & if he is correct in his prophecywhich I cannot doubt (for it agrees with the word of God) we live in the mostimportant event of the world. He says Babylon now is to fall and the cup ofGods indignation is now prepared for her & she must drink it & all who do notcome out of her must now fall with her he tells what time we live in & whatis now to fall upon the inhabitants of the earth who have not the mark in theirforeheads. He allso sayes that the destroying Angels have had their commishion &now gone forth to slay and according to his word great slaughter is nigh atthe doors. he appears most like a true prophet of any I ever conversed withMy Allmighty God prepare us for evry event & help us to live in such a mannerthat we may be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God whichare to fall on this generationFrom Your Brother W Woodruff 
 ELDERS' JOURNALOF THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS.VOL I. No. 1.]- KIRTLAND, OHIO, OCTOBER, 1837. -[Whole No. 1.North Lat, 44. Long. 69, 10. Vin-alhaven, Fox Islands, Monday, Sept. 18th, 1837.To JOSEPH SMITH Jr. AND THECHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS INKIRTLAND GREETING:Dear Saints of God, whom we love of a truth for the truth' sake that dwelleth in you, and we pray God that it may abide with you forev-er: As we are called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defence of the truth and for the word of God and thetestimony of Jesus Christ. We are under the necessity of making use of our pen, to give you an account of our labors in the ministry since we left Kirkland, as we cannot at present speak to you face to face. We left Kirtland May 31st, and took Steamboat at Fair-port in company with Elder Milton Holmes, to go forth to labor in the vineyard as the Lord should direct.After calling on the Saints in Jefferson Co. N. Y. we arrived at Sackett's Harbour and took Steamboat on the6th of June for Upper Canada and onthe 8th arived at Brother Artemus Judd's. And on the 10th, had the hap-py privilege of setting in conference with John E. Page, James Blakes-lee, and a number other elders, and a large congregation of Saints. And we were blessed with a very interesting time. After spending several days with them we took the parting hand with these beloved friends and pro-ceeded on our journey for the East in company with elder John Goodson, and others bound for England. We took the parting hand with them at Schenec-tady, and arrived at the Canaan church in Connecticut, visited the church a few days. Here elder M. Holmes took his departure for Mass. and we went to Colebrook, visited different parts of the town and held eight meetings, from thence to Canton and held a meet-ing in the village hall in Collinsville.As we commenced speaking severalbegan to beat their drums at the doors which made much confusion. This is the only disturbance we have had since we left Kirtland. We next visited Avon, where we held four meetings and many came out to hear and mani-fest a spirit of inquiry. And elder Woodruff had the privilege of leading three of his kinfolk into the waters of baptism. And had not the Spirit call-ed us away to perform a greater work, we should have had no difficulty in es-tablishing a branch of the church in that place. A family where we tarried but one night, and taught them the things of the kingdom, believed our tes-timony, and after our departure, two of the household followed us 15 miles to receive baptism at our hands, but we were gone, and they truly believed it to be a day of warning and not of ma-ny words. We also visited Farming-ton and held one meeting in the Meth-odist meeting house, and preached to an attentive congregation who wished to hear more concerning the great work of God. We left Farmington on the 20 of July, for Mass. and after visiting the Bradford church, and after preach-ing several times with them, we pro-ceeded on our journey to Saco, Maine, where we spent several days with the church and friends. But duty urging us forward to lift the warning voice to those that had not heard the sound of the gospel, we then went to the city of Portland. We there took the Steam-er Bangor on the 19 of August, to speed us on our way to the Islands of the sea, they landed us at Owls head at the set-ting of the sun: But how to get con-veyance to the Islands we knew not, we retired to a grove and offered up our thanks unto God for his mercies and asked him to open our way before us; we returned to the Inn and soon found some men that were going near the Islands that night, they said they would land us if we chose to take pas-sage with them. We accordingly went on board, they hoisted sail and landed us on North Fox Island, Vinalhaven, at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, August 20th. It was with peculiar feelings and sensations that we began to walk forth upon one of the Islands of the sea which was wrapped in the sable shades of night, whose waters, had never cov-ered a soul for the remission of their sins after the order of the gospel, and which soil had never been press-ed by the foot steps of an elder of Is-rael. We were strangers, pilgrims, and almost pennyless. But we had 
 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:THIS Certifies that Willford Woodruff has been receivedinto the church of the Latter Day Saints, organized on the sixth of April, in the year of our Lord, one thou-sand, eight hundred, and thirty, and has been ordained an elder according to the rules and regulations of saidchurch, and is duly authorized to preach the gospel, agreeably to the authority of that office.From the satisfactory evidence which we have of his good moral character, and his zeal for the cause of right-eousness, and diligent desire to persuade men to forsake evil and embrace truth, we confidently recommendhim to all candid and upright people as a worthy member of society.We, therefore, in the name, and by the authority of this church, grant unto this our worthy brother in theLord, this letter of commendation as a proof of our fellowship and esteem: praying for his success and pros-perity in our Redeemer's cause.Given by the direction of a conference of the elders of said church, assembled in Kirtland, Geauga county,Ohio, the third day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand, eight hundred, and thirty six.F.

 come on the Lords business, we believ-ed him faithful that had promised, and we felt willing to trust in his name, we soon came to a house, where we were received and we retired to rest. We arose in the morning made ourselves known as servants of the Lord, we in-quired if there was any religion or priests on the Island; we were inform-ed that there was a Baptist priest, a small church and a meeting house at the center of the Island. The town of Vinalhaven includes both North and South Fox Islands: Pop. 1800. The inhabitants are generally wealthy, in-telligent, industrious, generous and hospitable to strangers. North Island is 9 miles long, and 2 wide, pop. 800. South Island is 10 miles long, and 5 wide, pop. 1000 &c. As it was Sab-bath morning there was to be preach-ing in the meeting house, we conclu-ded to attend considering it a proper place to introduce the gospel. When we arived at the place, meeting had commenced, the deacon came to the door and we informed him that we were servants of the Lord, that we had a message for the people and wished to be heard, the deacon informed the priest that we were preachers of the gospel. He invited us into the stand and gave out an appointment for us at5 o'clock P.M. After the priest had closed his discourse he invited us to his house during the intermission. We presented him the book of Mormon, he appeared friendly and said he should like to read it. We met according to appointment and preached to them the first principles of the gospel. We then gave out appointments for the four fol-lowing evenings to be held at the sev-eral school houses on the Island. The people came out in great numbers and heard with attention and manifested much anxiety, and in fourteen days we held nineteen meetings. The Bap-tist priest became alarmed seeing that his craft was in danger; and fearing that if he held his peace all Fox Islands would believe on our words, accor-dingly he strove to use his influence against us, but without effect as you may judge on learning the fact that on Sunday the 27th while we met with a congregation, he had not so much as one to meet with him at his usual placeof worship, for the excitement was so great that the members of his church and deacon, were attending our meet-ings and inviting us to visit them, and inquiring into these things. The Lord clothed us with his Spirit, and we were enabled to stand up and boldly declare those things that are commanded us.And the sound thereof soon reached the neighboring Islands and some of the inhabitants soon hoisted their sails to convey them over the waters to hear the tidings for themselves. On Sun-day the 3rd of Sept. we preached to a large congregation assembled together from these Islands, at the close of our meeting we opened a door for baptism, and a respectable sea captain and his wife offered themselves as candidates, we then assembled where there was much water and after offering up our prayers unto God, we then lead them down into the sea and baptized them and we returned rejoicing. On Mon-day following we visited the South Is-land to set before them the truths of the everlasting gospel. We held five meetings, the people came out by hun-dreds, to hear and filled the school-houses to overflowing.Notwithstanding the anxiety of the people to hear more upon this impor-tant subject, yet we were under the necessity of returning to the North Is-land, to attend an appointment on Sun-day, accordingly we met and preached to the people and opened a door for baptism and another sea Captain and a young lady came forward and we re-paired to the sea shore and baptized them, and on Tuesday following, we administered the ordinance of baptism unto three others.A Methodist priest on the South Is-land fearing whereunto these things would grow, came over to the Island where we were baptizing and made friends with the Baptist priest (like Herod and Pilate) and called a meet-ing, we attended [##Luke 23:12##]. The Methodist priest arose and commenced warm hostilities against the book of Mormon, and our principles, we took minutes of his dis-course that we might be correct in an-swering him. As he could not bring proof from the word of God against our principles, and in order to make an impression upon the minds of his hearers against the work; he took the book of Mormon in his hand, and with an out stretched arm declared that he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon him for rejecting that book as the word of God.

 he closed his meeting we arose and rectified some of his wide mistakes in his presence before the congregation, and informed the people if they would meet next Sabbath at the meeting house we would answer every ebjection that had been presented against the book of Mormon and our principles du-ring the meeting. And last Sabbath we met a congregation of several hun-dred at the meeting house, assembled together from the different Islands, and we arose in their midst, and redeemed our pledge by answering every objec-tion that had been brought against the book of Mormon, or our principles.After meeting we repaired to the water and again administered the ordinance of baptism. The Baptist priest is no less busy than his Methodist brother, for while one is in the pulpit declaring to the people, that the principles of the book of Mormon are saping the very foundation of our churches and holy religion; the other is gone over to the main land calling upon his Baptist brethren, saying come over and help us lest we fall. But cursed is man that trusteth in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord God. O ye priests of Baal your cry is in vain, the God of Israel has set his hand the second time to recover his people. The stone has began to roll, and will soon become a mountain and fill the whole earth. The Lord is calling his church out of the wilderness, with her gifts and graces and restoring her judges as at the first. God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and with them he will rend your kingdoms, that the wisdom of your wise men may perish, and the understanding of yonr prudent men may be hid. The cry of the Saints is ascending into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim.The horns of Joseph are begining to push the people together. The apos-tles of the Lamb of God are bearing the keys of his kingdom on the shores of Europe. Yea and the mighty Captains of the ships at sea, are receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ; and enjoying its power, and the call of many from distant Islands, has already entered our ears; O come and preach to us, we have sent a book of Mormon over the billows of the great deep, to teach those that are at sea. And the word and work are propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And the weapon that is formed against Zion shall soon be broken. And he that raises his puny arm against it, is fighting against God and shall soon mourn because of his loss. We say these things are true as God liveth, and the Spirit beareth rec-ord and the record is true, and ven-geance will be speedily executed upon an evil work in these last days, there-fore, O Babylon thy fall is sure.Although we have not baptized but few on these Islands, yet there is hun-dreds believing and many are almost ready to enter into the kingdom, the calls are numerous from the neighbor-ing Islands, and also from the main land, for us to come and preach unto them, and tell them words whereby they may be saved from the pending judgments that await the world. There are fifteen or twenty neighboring Islands that are inhabited, some of them con-tain a population of several thousand. And while the fields are white, we view the harvest great in this country: and the laborers few. And while we are faithfully laboring day and night for the salvation of his people; we ask an interest in your prayers, O ye Saints of the most high God. O ye elders of Israel will ye not go forth in-to the vineyard and help wind up the scene of this generation which sits in darkness and in the shadow of death.  O ye ministers of our God, if we alto-gether hold our peace at this time, shall we not suffer loss when the Lord raises up deliverance unto Israel. But for Zion's sake let us not hold our peace, and for Jerusalem's sake let us not rest until the light thereof go forth as bright-ness and salvation as a lamp that burn-eth.That we all may keep the patience and faith of the Saints and see that no man take our crown, is the prayer of your brethren in the Lord Jesus.WILLFORD WOODRUFF,JOHNATHAN H.

 TIMES AND SEASONS."Truth will prevail."Vol. III. No. 12.]-  CITY OF NAUVOO, ILL. APRIL 15, 1842. -[Whole No. 48.For the Times and Seasons.SABBATH SCENE IN NAUVOO;March 20th 1842.A large assembly of Saints gathered together at the place of meeting at an early hour, to hear a discourse delivered by President Joseph Smith, upon the subject of Baptism. A child of Mr. Windsor P. Lyons being deseased, the body of which lay before the assembly, called forth many remarks from the speaker upon the subject of death and the resurrection, which were in the highest degree interesting and edifying, as were also his remarks upon the subject of baptism.The following is a brief synopsis of some of the items delivered by the speaker.President Smith read the ##Revelations 14|14th chap. of Rev.##and said,"We have again the warning voice sounded in our midst which shows the uncertainty of human life; and in my leisure moments I have meditated upon the subject, and asked the question, Why it is that infants, innocent chil-dren are taken away from us? especially those that seem to be the most intelligent and inter-esting? and the strongest reasons that present themselves to my mind are these: This world is a very wicked world; and it is a proverb that the 'world grows weaker and wiser' if it is the case, the world grows more wicked and corrupt. In the early ages of the world, a righte-ous man, and a man of God, and of intelligence, had a better chance to do good, to be believedand received, than at the present day; but in these days such a man is much opp[os]ed and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth; and he has much sorrow to pass through here, the Lord takes many away even in in-fancy that they may escape the envy of man,and the sorrows and evils of this present world;they were too pure, too lovely, to live on earth; therefore if rightly considered instead of mourning we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from evil, and we shall soon havethem again."What chance is there for infidelity when we are parting with our friends almost daily?None at all. The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until death stares him in the face, and then his infidelity takes its flight, for the realities of the eternal world are resting upon him in mighty power; and when every earthly support and prop fails him, he then sensibly feels the eternal truths of the immor-tality of the soul. We should take warning and not wait for the death bed to repent, as we see the infant taken away by death, so may the youth and middle aged, as well as the infant suddenly be called into eternity.Let this then prove as a warning to all, not to procrastinate repentance, or wait till a deathbed; for it is the will of God that man should repent, and serve him in health, and inthe strength, and power of his mind, in order to secure his blessing; and not wait until he is called to die. Also the doctrine of Baptiz-ing children, or sprinkling them, or they must welter in hell is a doctrine not true, not sup-ported in Holy writ, and is not consistent with the character of God. All children are re-deemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the moment that children leave this world they are taken to the bosom of Abraham. The only difference between the old and young dying, is, one lives longer in heaven, and eternal light and glory than the other, and is freed a little sooner from this miserable wicked world.Notwithstanding all this glory, we for a mo-ment lose sight of it, and mourn the loss; but we do not mourn as those without hope."My intention was, to have spoken upon the subject of baptism, but having a case of death before us I thought proper to refer to that subject. I will now however say a few words upon baptism, as I intended. God has made certain decrees which are fixed, and immovable, for instance; God set the sun, the moon, and the stars in the heavens; and gave them their laws, conditions, and bounds which they cannot pass, except by his commandments; they all move in perfect harmony in their sphere, and order, and are as lights, wonders, and signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds which it cannot pass. God has set many signs on the earth, as well as in the heavens, for in-stance; the oak of the forest, the fruit of the tree, the herb of the field; all bear a sign that seed hath been planted there; for it is a decree of the Lord that every tree, plant, and herb, bearing seed, should bring forth of its kind, and cannot come forth after any other law, or prin-ciple. Upon the same principle do I contend that baptism is a sign ordained of God, for the believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the kingdom of God, "for except ye are born of water, and of the spirit ye can-not enter into the kingdom of God," [##John 3:5##] saith the Saviour. It is a sign, and commandment which 
 God has set for man to enter into his Kingdom.Those who seek to enter in any other way willseek in vain; and God will not receive them,neither will the angels acknowledge their works as accepted; for they have not obeyedthe ordinances, nor attended to the signs which God ordained for the salvation of man, to prepare him for; and give him a title to a celestial glory; and God has decreed that all who will not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation of hell. What is the damnation of hell? to go with that society who have not obeyed his commands. Baptism is a sign to God, to Angels, and to heaven that we do the will of God: and there is no other way beneath the heavens whereby God hath ordained for man to come to him, to be saved, and enter into the kingdom of God, except faith in Jesus Christ; repentance, and baptism for the remis-sion of sins, and any other course is in vain;then you have the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost. What is the sign of the healing of the sick? the laying on of hands is the sign, or way marked out by James; and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordered by the Lord; and we can not obtain the blessing by pur-suing any other course, except the way marked out by the Lord.What if we should attempt to get the gift of the Holy Ghost through any other means, ex-cept the signs, or way which God hath ap-pointed? should we obtain it? certainly not; all other means would fail. The Lord says do so, and so, and I will bless, so, and so.There are certain key-words, and signs belong-ing to the priesthood, which must be observed in order to obtain the blessing, the sign of Peter was to repent, and be baptized for the remission of sins, with the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost: and in no other way is thegift of the Holy Ghost obtained. There is a difference between the Holy Ghost, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized; which was the convincing power of God unto him ofthe truth of the gospel; but he could not receivethe gift of the Holy Ghost until after he wasbaptized. Had he not taken this sign, or or-dinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which con-vinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick, or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man,and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto him, as they did to the sons of Sceva; 'Paul we know; and Jesus we know, but who are ye!' [##Acts 19:15##] It mattereth not whether we live long or short on the earth after we come to a knowl-edge of these principles and obey them unto the end. I know that all men will be damned if they do not come in the way which he hath opened; and this is the way marked out by the word of the Lord."As concerning the resurrection I will mere-ly say that all men will come from the grave as they lie down, whether old or young, there will not be 'added unto their stature one cubit;'neither taken from it; all will be raised by the power of God, having spirit in their bodies, and not blood. Children will be enthroned in the presence of God, and the Lamb; with bodies of the same stature that they had on earth; hav-ing been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,they will there enjoy the fulness of that lightglory, and intelligence which is prepared inthe Celestial kingdom: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.' [##Revelations 14:13##]The speaker before closing called upon the assembly before him, to humble themselves in faith before God, and in mighty prayer and fasting to call upon the name of the Lord,until the elements were purified over our heads,and the earth sanctified under our feet; that the inhabitants of this city may escape the power of disease and pestilence, and the destroyer that rideth upon the face of the earth; and that the Holy Spirit of God may rest upon this vast multitude. At the close of the meeting Presi-dent Smith informed the congregation that heshould attend to the ordinance of Baptism in the river near his house, at 2 o'clock; and at the appointed hour the bank of the Mississippi was lined with a multitude of people, and Pres-ident Joseph Smith went forth into the river and baptized with his own hands 80 persons, for the remission of their sins; and what added joy to the scene was, that the first person bap-tized was Mr. L. D. Wasson, a nephew of Mrs Emma Smith; the first of her kindred that have embraced the fulness of the Gospel.At the close of this interesting scene the ad-ministrator lifted up his hands towards heaven,and implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people; and truly the spirit of God did restupon the multitude, to the joy and consolation of our hearts. After baptism the congregation again repaired to the grove, near the Temple,to attend to the ordinance of confirmation; and, notwithstanding, President Smith hadspoken in the open air to the people, and stood in the water and baptized about 80 persons, about 50 of those baptized received their con-firmation under his hands, in the after part of 
 the day. While this was progressing great numbers were being baptized in the font.Those who wish for further information con-cerning the scenes of the Sabbath in Nauvoo, or any other day in the week would do well to "come and see."W. WOODRUFF. 
 Farmington Nov 28 1845Dear Son WilfordIt is now Thanksgiving eve with us, & wehave been waiting in earnest expectation for a number of weeks tohear from you again. I should have written you eer this, had it not been for the consequent ersults of the late trouble at the west zvivz the determinations of the church to remove to a more hospitable clime&c &c, & as we your Parents verily supposed, their son Wilford wouldnever engage in this great enterprize without first visiting ^his native^ landbecause firstly, they were conscious that he not only had children inhis native Land but also some property there which they concludedhe must of necessity attend to before he left these united States,& secondly that he had Parents there who had for some time pastbeen looking to him as one who, in some not very distand  period wouldprobably be able & willing to assist them in gathering with the Saints& their other dear children who had gone thither & whom they muchwished to see, & that now as the church had determined upon a removeacross the Rocky Mountains to California surely they thought itcould not be long before he would be returning to the West & makecalculations to call on them to stir them up & assist them in preparingfor the great event viz to aid them on to the West & give them a littletime to rest & visit their Children untill the opening of the springwhen they wocould all both Parents & Children be prepared to take theirfinal leave with the church & in the strength of Israels God engagin the Rocky Mou scaling the flinty Mountains I thought soon afterwe had the account that the church would all remove, & told yourfather, that I would write as it was high time we had, but that it wasnot certain but that you might have had the news sooner, as soon a[s]we & that you might be returning before a Letter could get to you &knowing your zeal in things pertaining to the Kingdomof God we finally thot best to omit writing you, your father hadoften said I wonder Wilford dont write us or, that we do notrecieve a communication from him, if he is coming on this fall& this, we surely thot you would do & when your father said, I dontknow how W. will be visit for the means to assist us in goingthe answer was at hand, viz that I thought & felt that as he hadfrom time to time assisted the Saints especially when in Englandto come to America that that they might go to the Land of Zion& that now, as he would in all probability desire to help hisParents & other relatives to go with the church that the Lord woldopen & prepare the way before him by granting him meanssufficient to accomplish the desired object. Indeed your father& myself have fell much on the subject I can say that it has lookedvery pleasent to me to think of going even across the Rocky Mountains 
 Indeed I have had a great choice in view of going by Land & yourFather said, before the trouble at the west after reading a descripti-on of California that there was no place in the world where heshould like to go as well as to California but, enough of this strainWe have rec'd a Letter from our Children at Nauvoo, to day, & it was the firstwe have had since their trouble, & it was with a trembling hand, that I brokethe seal, yet we learned therefrom that they were all in the Land of theliving, & in somewhat comfortable circumstance, yet the contents of the same were such in general as to sicken our hearts & give us theworst of feelings but what, you will ask, did it contain. Why, in thefirst place our children spoke of the removal of the church as thothey had no part nor lot in the matter, & principily because they hadno means to assist themselves to go & no information that anyone wouldlend a helping hand to assist them, there is something Wilford thatlooks quite dark to us in this affair & there seems to be a good deal ofit too if we can judge anything from their communication & herearises a question in our hearts which seems at this time hard to be solvedviz, can these things be of God, but now Wilford you will say, Mother Imust be crazy, but I can tell you Son W. that for near thirty years yourMothers mind, or the exercises of the same have in almost every instancewhere any thing of a serious nature was about to transpire have provedto ^be^ as a preface to the final result & now I now not how to understand theexcercises of mind I have had of late, when contrasted with present appear-ances, our Children write that you have been counciled to go Direct fromEngland to California. If a thunbolt had racked our house I shouldnot have been more astounded than upon reading this declaration. I haveever believed since I became aquainted with spiritual things that thework of the Lord never clashed, but here is something that looks somuch like it, that I am filled with wonder & astonishment, now Iwould ask one question or two, has not President Young been madeaquainted with the fact, that you had Parents who were in the declineof life, & [w]ho of course looked to you as their all as it were especially asto the privige of gathering with the Saints & that altho they have othersons who would gladly receive their society & do all that lay thatlay in their power to render them every necessary assistance but that after all, the moment they should  go to dwell with or near by their sons they would be constrained to give up their religion or theprinciples of the Gospel unless they should conclude to live in onecontinual conflict as have the Saints in Illinois I say has Presid-dent Young been made aquainted with these facts as also that youhave an only Sister residing in Nauvoo, who has for a number of years past been in a very peculiarly afflicted state not only in reg-ard to her own health but also on the account of the misfortunesof her companion in life, & consequently would stand in specialneed of some little assistance from her Brother in such an import-ant crisis as the present but if this has not been the case It does appear 
 [sideways text] Why Son Wilford what a predicament your Parents& their friends would be in suppose you should actuallygo as we have had intimation. I cannot think, it will beso, if for no other reason than this, that your Parentscould never again say, that they had not been conf-ounded while endeavouring to trust in the Lord god ofIsrael, & the scriptures tell us that such shall never beconfounded in worlds without end, now I do not supposethat if indeed President Young has given such councilto you that it proves that he is not ordinarly possessed ofas much wisdom as any ^other^ person on the earth, but ratherhis having so much business to attend to did not think to [end of sideways text]enquire whether you had ^not^ Parents & otherfriends whom it would be your dutyto see to on this important occasion, butthe special predicament I illerded towould be this, that we your Parents would not either be with the churchnor get to our children at Nauvoo, nor theyto us, because they would not be able to doof themselves alone. It does actually seemthe most strange thing in the worldthat since you are the only Male memberin our family who has any connectionwith this church that the minds of the Twelve have ^not^ had a consciouslyness of theresponsibility is resting upon you inregard to your somewhat numerous frie-nds for Indeed had your Father a suf-ficent supply of means to help us onthe journey still, you know we should need your aid, & as you are so well acq-uainted with travelling, & your fatherso little, but I have filled my sheet yousee & some over.

 Terre Haute Dec 10th 1837Dear brotherYou enquire in your last whether Iget the "Latter Dayy Saints" from Kirtland. I do andam obliged for the favor but to whom I am indebted I donot know unless yourself I have read some of the com-munications in the "Elders Journal" with a good deal of interest but I must have leave to say that I do not admire the style and spirit of the Letter from Englandparticularly that part which related to the pious devotionof brother Kemball to his wife and children and JesusChrist. I do not perceive any necessary connection in ideabetween the crucifixion of JOur Savior and the welfareof ones wife and children and why the latter clausewas added I cannot conceive unless to prevent thejealousy of his wife.It is very seldom that I get Letters from home the latesthowever render accounts of good health and generalprosperity I believe the situation of our family inFarmington is more agreeable than before the sojournin Colebrook. Mother and Eunice express theirsatisfaction with the advantages of good society whichthey enjoy and I immagine they improve it betterthan they formerly did. They write that they receiveevery desireable attention.You will recollect that I was interrupted in my last, inthe pursuit of an interesting subject, by an "inexpressible"but I am happy to assure you that no harm was done or other effect produced than the Excitement of a few sensations which soon wore off leaving me cool and calm.But to return—I was speaking of the confusion 
 produced in my mind by your mention of the changein Sister Eunice. If she was not our only sister orif I was less sensitive or less susceptible of the warmersensibilities of human nature I should probably never haveoccasion to allude to my sister in refference to any changein me. There is indeed a change in me since you saw mebut in some respects it is not such a change as you would naturally expect to find. In that particular respect in which I have not advanced to that state ^tone^ of character which you would expect and to which Ishall refer you. I trace the cause to my deepdefvotion to my sister—the interest I have feellt inher—and my great ansxiety for her. Instead of anadvance with my years to the deportment of manhoodand to the pursuits and tastes of ripen years I ammore childish in feeling and deportment than whenyou saw me last. It appears to me that trifles whichwould be objects of desire at the age of twelve affordme as much gratification as at that period of my lifeand in the choice of companions I am never so wellpleased as in the company of boys and girls.In selecting my female associates I hardly ever choosethose over 12 or 14 years for past that age theyare in my estimation past the age of lovlinessperfect loveliness. And to think of paying mycourt to a young Lady within 3 or 4 years of myown age would seem an absurdity which I couldscarcely surmount. If I have a coat at the Tailorsit is as much an object of desire with me to see itcompleted as with a boy to get a new Hat. And[sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character [end of sideways text] 
 when any new tho, unimportant arrangement is accomplished in my business I am as much elatedas is the same boy when he gets permission to spenda week at his uncles in the city. And if a girlof 13 does not return my tenderness (meekness?)my passions rage like a burning volcano. Thereason of all which I believe may be found in myardent devotion to my sister. If for the last five yearsI have had a desire to live—to prosper—to acquirereputation—wealth and respectability the excitingimpulse has been my regard for her. I havelived for her—I have toiled for her—and forher only have I struggled against theadversities of fortune—that she might beblessed—that in me she might find succourand support. She has dwelt continually inmy mind has occupied my first thoughtsand when in my happier moments I have thoughtmyself blessed—this cloud that has soonestspread over my joy has been the reflection thatshe could not share with me my happiness The image of my sister which has so often beenpictured to my imagination has been that of thegirl of 13 which that I left at my fathers houseI have never been able to fancy her in any othercharacter than that of the little girl I used to leadabout by the hand.

 Terre Haute July 22 1837Brother Wilford.I received witH pleasure your letter datedFarmington 7th Inst and read it over and over with muchsatisfaction. I am much interested in the account of yourvisit among our common friends and I know not that anythingcould afford me higher pleasure than to participate with you inthe joy of such an occasion. It has been our lot to be seperatedfor a long time and under circumstances rather unusual.Yet it does not appear to me that there can be any reason toapprehend that the kindred ties that which unite us have in anydegree loosened their bond. We are still brothers— and friendsand while we have a sister—a mother and a common fatheraround whom to rally the purer sentiments of our hearts,have we not a mutual pledge of Enduring affection—ofbrotherly love? I am aware that the correspondence that haspassed between us since we parted has not been of a characterto evidence the highest degree of brotherly regard forwe have been perplexed with the cares and anxieties of lifeand by the mysterious phenomena of mind have beenwidely seperated in our views hence it is not strange thatour intercourse has been interrupted. But we do notlook to the regular and uniform interchange of writtencommunication for a pledge of each other's affection—wehave this assurance in the nature of our relations andin our capacity to appreciate Each others claim.You intimate the apprehension that your letters have notinterested me—you are mistaken—I have ever read your letters with satisfaction and have only at times wishedthat they contained a more particular account of yourpersonal affairs, being more interested in them thanin the great "common cause". 
 With regard to "Mormonism" I suppose we do not differmuch about its peculiar doctrines. In the application ofthe principles of these doctrines, however I imagine I shallnot for some time be able to see the propriety of the coursepursued by Mormons. I do not indeed believe that theprominent doctrines of the sect are peculiar to "Mormonismproper". These doctrines have been maintained ever sincethe gospel was preached by a large number of every sectand I have yet to be satisfied that these popular doctrineswere not introduced into the Mormon Economy in anarbitrary manner to decare the influence and favorof that respectable portion of community.So it respects the inspiration of the "Book of Mormon"and of "Mr Smith" (the prophet) or indeed any of the pretensions of the "Saints" of which I am informed I donot think them unreasonable. I do not know but they^are^ in perfect accordance with the revelation of thedoctrine of Jesus Christ as presented to us in theBible but I have yet to be convinced that they aremore than empty pretensions. Every prominentdoctrine of Mormonism may true be true, while theleaders of the sect, those indeed who assume to them-selves the high prerogation of teachers from Godto man may be rotten in heart, corrupt in lifeand ignorant of the first principle of holy religionThese are some of my views. I entertain a dear respectfor the cause and tho I have sometimes spoke lightlyof it as in some of my letters to my friends it hasnot been with the intention to ridicule, but ratherto gratify my propensity to amuse myself at theexpense of others. 
 You see I employ the term "Mormon" whenrefering to your church. I do this respectfully andonly because it is the most convenient term I canfind. And I can discover no impropriety in it forother sects on designated by some popular termand it would be nonsense for "Latter Day Saints"to deny that they are a sect for ^they are^ as thoroughly identifiedwith sectarianism as other churches.I hope you will write to me again soon and may Inot expect the pleasure of seeing you here in the courseof the fall. I think you would do well to visit thispart of the "Vineyard" and which perhaps you ^will^ think all-most equal to Zion.

 Terre Haute July 22nd 1838.Sunday A. M.Ever dear brother.I have now before me three unanswered letters from you havingdates, "Vinal Haven March 10th" "Scarborough May 2thnd" and Farmington June 26th 1838. From one so prone to complain of the neglect of correspondents asI am, such delinquency as this comes with a bad grace, and I would offer anapology for an excuse, but then I hate excuses, and so will substitute an expl-anation. I have not been inattentive to your letters nor have I lacked a feeling ofdeep interest in them, but I have so weighed them. And have so felt the importanceof the subject which has generally and mainly employed your pen that I have des-ired to return appropriate answers. And hence have delayed from day to day andfrom week to week for time to do justice to your favors untill so much matter has accumulated upon which I should be pleased to communicate my reflectionsthat I fear my pen recoils as I now attempt to direct it. I have been sokindly disposed towards you as to pass the "firm resolve" to answer your every letter, andto give you line for line and thought for thought nay morey—I have laid otherplans for your entertainment and perhaps amusement. I have designed giving you suchdetails of "the way the world has gone with me" since I parted with you at [Richland],that you would be enabled to see before you as "large as life" your little brother,and comprehend the object of his existence but I have deferred the matter untill I should have "a more convenient season" and so time which waiteth for noman has imperceptibly glided away while I have not discharged ^even^ the immediateduties of brother to brother much less have I accomplished thou high designs which I had conceived for your gratification as the unaffected offeringsof friend to friend. And this is but the history of my whole concernfromFrom my earliest life I have been continually laying plans for future("greatness", shall I say?) nay whatever may have been my frailties and foibles I have not had ^added^ the folly of aspiring to greatness., my plans have beenof future goodness and usefulness. In early life I became enamoured of thecharms of virtue, and the aspirations of my heart were after goodness and truth my ambition led me to aspirey—high indeed—but after humility and meeknessand it was in the lowliness of my mind that at a very tender age I well remem-ber feeling the kindlings of a virtuous pride in anticipations of future goodnessand usefulness. But ah! how sadly have my well formed but ill timed plansbeen frustrated The accursed spirit of procrastination has been the cankerworm of my degradation, What has been to me the duty of to day has beenmade the business of to morrow. And to morrow has not come!!I am aware that it is common place confession to speak of one's misimproved time, And to acknowledge the sin and folly of procrastination is but a modest wayof intimating that we are not righteous over much but brother it is the history of scenes of no common folly and neglect that I here divulge and if you couldperceive as I feel the sickly barrenness of my mind and the polluted sinfulness of my heart and could be persuaded as I am that it is all the result ofputting off untill to morrow the business of to day you would indeed [groan]at my calamity. It is a fact that in relation to the acquisition of knowledgefrom books and from observation, to the cultivation of my mind by the proper exercise of my intellect, to the encouragement of virtuous disposition in my heart and the inclination to become good and win, as wellas in relation to the management of pecuniary matters and all thingsappertaining to my life and the various relations I have procrastinatedevery thing but my folly. 
 In your letter of March 10th you very kindly utter the wish that you could "commune withsome "Heavenly Messenger" and give vent before him to your feelings concerning tho towhom you are bound by the ties or consanguinity" That you are often present in the spirit withthou with whom you are bound by the ties of nature I have no doubt and it is a source of muchsatisfaction to me to believe that I enjoy a liberal share of your regard that I do not deservemuch of your consideration is a reflection ungrateful indeed to me but nevertheless quite trueunless my appreciation of your worth and a tender regard for you as a brother and friendentitles me to a corresponding degree of your regard. I have felt a good deal ofinterest in the accounts you give of your travels in the ministry more particularly per-haps because it is a matter which concerns your welfare though I per am unwillingto admit that I do not feel a good deal of interest also in the progress the work inwhich you are so successfully engaged. I have followed you to the far west to thefield of contest and there my apprehensions were excited for you as well as account ofyour exposure to the evil designs of the world as to the contagious malady whichprevailed to so alarming and degree. My excitement was of a feverish character.I feared that the hand of the violent man would fall upon you—that the abuses ofthe vulgar and the coarse minded would be heaped upon your head as upon the headof an outlaw and a ruffian, and that no voice would be heard in your defensedeclaring that you were innocent of any evil designs upon the peace of comm-unity. Then the work came as on the wings of the wind that a deadly contagionhad visited your camp and that scores had already fallen before you andcould I rest and be at peace while my brother stood exposed to the shaftsof death! But another word came which told of the breaking up ofyour bandy—of its disperson to East and to the South to the North and tothe West and you were placed before me a wanderer over the fairof the Earth in the capacity of a preacher of doctrines which were a by-word and a proverb among men. I already fancied I saw you exposedto the ridicule and the scoffs of bigots, hypocrites unbelievers wicked men anddevils and was pained at indignities and insults which I imagined werebeing heaped upon you and I had not even the consolation of knowing that you wereengaged in the cause of God (for then indeed I could have endured to see you suffer persecution, under the full persuasion that you would beblessed and honored by the King of Saints) though I did not doubt thatyou believed you were doing right and that you bore along with ^you^ a clearconscience and an honest heart. Many long months passed away and I heardnot a word respecting you – what might have befallen you I was in doubts andbutI felt a fearful apprehension that you something ill had befallen you. Anangry insurrection had been plotted and was discovered just upon the eveof its breaking out—the people of the South were inflamed and theirvengeance was visited upon many innocent and unsuspecting persons, there was no liberty of speech there and a person had only to be suspected ofentertaining sentiments appored to some of the institutions of the Southto be visited with all the horrors of a hellish anarchy. Under these circum-stances my emmotions were such as I cannot well ^express^—my fears were of thegloomist character for I knew your enthusiasm and your determinationto maintain your priviledges rights as an American citisen—perhaps in yoursentiments you were appored to the institution of slavery and in the fearof God you would be constrained to raise your voice against it, a coursewhich would have brought upon you swift destruction from the presence of men—and my forebodings were bitter indeed. If I had any hope foryour safety it was in the kind care of providence—I had no confidencein the protection which would be afforded you in the plea that you 
 were a free citizen of this republic during that dark "reign of terror". ButI was permitted once more to hail your return to your friends, and to rejoice in the triumphyou had thus gained over the enemy and had the happiness once more to peruse thelines dictated by your brotherly kindness. I saw you engage in preparing yourselffor the more efficient discharge of your duties as a minister of grace and amongyour fellows I imagined you giving and receiving counsel in relation to matters app-ertaining to the interests of "the Church" I saw you taking upon yourself the floweryyoke of matrimony and, (believe me) I rejoiced in the consideration that in subm-itting your neck to the yoke you had found a true yoke-fellow in whom youmight not only find an assistant bearer of your burdens and sharer of your sorrows andjoys but also an agreeable companion who should sweeten the sorrows of your life,and heighten the enjoyments of your happier hours by her cheerful smile and devotedlove. I saw you bending your way to the far East to enter a new field, even to speakthe word to the "Islands of the Sea". I followed you in your journeyings and saw youcommence your labors upon the Islands—rejoice in your sucess—prayed foryour comfort and safety—lamented the bigotry and intolerance you encountered,and left ashamed with you that men, nay—that those who present themselvesto the world as ambassadors from the Court of Heaven, should so far departfrom the principles of spirit of enlightened, liberal, & republican principles(to say nothing of the principles of the religion they profess) as did thoupreachers and Elders who so ungenerously opposed you. Fools that they are!to believe in a God and to worship him in the forms of his religion and at thesame time to have so little confidence in His cause as to fear and quake lesta handful of "Mormons" should upturn there it root and branch! I followedyou on your return to the main land and accompanied you again to the land of yourbirth, was with you in spirit aroundat a fathers house and did not envyyou the paternal affection and maternal tenderness which you there enjoyedand in the fulness of a brothers heart I did not forget to yield to youthe entire devotion of a sisters heart. It was indeed a priviledge which youenjoyed to spend so pleasant a season at home and I should have been happy[therin] happy to have made one in the family circle on that occasion. But how soon I shall enjoy that pleasure with you or whether such happiness is inreserve for me at all is a subject I do not like to reflect upon. But I havenot forgotten that previous to your last visit at home you went to New Yorkthat you then met with your bre[thren] from Europe and heard from them ofthe progress of the "work" in a foreign land. I went up the North Riverwith you and across the hills and dales to Connecticut. Conjured up all the familiar faces in Avon, Lovely street cider brooks &c &c and broughtthem up to hear the mormon preacher, and [have] several times gone downwith you to the solumn waters of baptism. All them and many otherpicturesscenes have I frequently imagined myself a witness of—and this hastyand imperfect outline so imperfectly drawn (in my haste) has affordedthe subject of many a picture which I have dwelt upon with muchinterest drawing so largely upon my imagination it would be expectedthat many of the scenes which I should represent to myself would be merefancy sketches and I presume that in following your amid the diver-sified scenes of the last few years of your life I have often followed you ata great distance and sometimes perhaps have mistook^aken^ your way. That Ihave not fully ^properly^ appreciated the spirit by which your steps have been directedI think is more than probable for indeed I am incompetent to judge with regardto the character of the cause in which you have been engaged I have ^having^ neverbeen able to avail myself of such information as would enable me to formadequate ideas of the origin—character and tendency of Mormonism. 
 Brother, I have repeated to you that I feel interested in the question of MormonismI again repeat that I am deeply so. There then no other reason than that I have abrother who is identified with the leaders of the Society this would be sufficient groundfor any interest which I may feel. But when to there is added the consideration that myfather—my mother and my only sister as well as many other friends are underits influence and are liable to become members of the society it becomes doublymy interest and duty to enquire if the doctrine be true. If Mormonismis the work of God and the peculiarities of Mormonism are founded inEternal Truth I desire to know it. If it is true then my highest interestand the highest interest and the highest interest of my friends is involvedin our embracing it with all its terms. If it is untrue or if in other termsMormonism—proper and peculiar is not founded inupon direct revelationfrom Heaven God forbid that one of us should be under its influenceanother day. That the prominent doctrines of Mormonism are in generalcorrect and are even more reasonable than perhaps ^those of^ any other sects I amready enough to believe but then their doctrines may all be true foundedupon correct principles and yet Joseph Smith Jr may be as arrant[as known] and as great an impostor as ever lived. if this is the casewe can renounce Mormonism and at the same time retain every correct principle and doctrine which it embodies. But I must [close]I will only now add that I am bound to believe Joseph Smith Jr and allthe leaders of your society honest men untill it is disproved. Yet Ihave no proof of the truth of their pretensions except the admissionyou have made and they are not satisfactory to me not being asexplicit as I could wish. I shall probably trouble you with some questions regardingthis subject before long and shall hold you responsible for the result of the sameby virtue of the interest which we mutually have in an only sister who is inclinedto become a member of the Church of the Latter Days Saints. Hold yourselfready and peradventure you may make a believer of me and to God shall beall the glory.[sideways text][end sideways text][sideways text-right]Please permit me to pay my compliments to Mrs Woodruff andexcuse my impoliteness in doing so in so obscenea corner as this.

 Terre Haute Nov 24th 1837Dear brotherYour letter dated Vinal haven. Oct 20th is beforeme and has been perused over and over with much satisfactionI thank you sincerely for this token of your regard, and am the moregratified with the favor from the indications which it manifeststhat you desire my correspondence. In responding to your wishesin this respect permit me to assure you I anticipate great pleasure.I believe that a well regulated correspondence may be both interestingand profitable and, situated as we are I can perceive no reasonwhy we should decline its advantages. And indeed when we considerthe relation we sustain to each other what reason can we find to justifysuch neglect? An unreserved correspondence with you has for along time been an object of desire with me. I embrace thenthwith pleasure the priviledge (which I think the Spirit of yourletter warrants me in inferring you will grant) and hope I shallhereafter be permitted to consider you a regular correspondent.I hope you will write me often, and without regard to order inrefference to my answers for we are both so situated that wecannot at all times observe regularity in our communicationWe must write, then, whenever we are in the "mood" trustingto circumstances for matter.There is much in your letter I should like to nanswer, but must contentmyself with noticing a part only. Could a brothers heart find anything more prominent in your letter than that which relates to hisonly sister? You strike a tender chord when you allude to thisobject of my first regard and when you speak of the change, timehas wrought in her—you bewilder my brain—you excite withinme a struggle between my imagination and my judgment, whichshows me too plainly my weakness—Confound it!! will youbelieve that just as I ^was^ expressing the last sentence a pretty facedgirl of 14 years, of "undoubled character" who is in the habit ofvisiting every body came plump in upon ^me^ and took her seat closeby me poking her head right into my face, exciting prettysensations? to mix with those ^sentiments^ I was just indulging in. It wouldbe a sin to resume the sacred subject. So while the fair one (?)is looking at the picture books I will only nadd that sisteris at home in Farmington, attending the Academy, that I long to see her and if I don't forget where I left off I willresume to the sentimental again, and render the passagecomplete and the idea intelligible. 
 Next in turn as connected with the subject I was so unfortunatelyinterrupted in pursuing, would come the change in me, but hereI am at total loss, the matter being so completely involved in theformer subject that I could not discuss it except in connectionso you will please have the goodness to wait unttill untill I takeup the former again when I promise to present thelatter free from obscurity. But lest you should by somestrange vaguary get the notion that I am ^in^ the way to bea great man I will here promise that you will be sadlydisappointed when you are informed with regard to mycharacter. I honestly fear I shall never meet the expectationsof those of my friends whose anticipations were the mostmoderate, much less those whose partiality led them tosuppose me a clever fellow.You enquire whether I have "any intelligence from brother Azmonand family or Thompson" I presume I know nothing of themthat you did not learn at home, for the last I heard from themwas in a letter from home before you visited. Neither of themhave written to me except Azmon wrote one letter perhapseighteen months ago God bless them! if He don't I really don'tknow who will have an opportunity to do so soon.You also enquire about my business and when I think of going East, to the latter I reply I have been thinking of going Eastnext "two months" for the last two and half years, whenI shall so digest my thoughts as to be able to reduce themto practice I do not know, probably, however next SpringBusiness has been generally (as you will anticipate) dullthe last season throughout this part of the country, for reasons which all intelligent persons are acquainted withit is however improving and the prospect for nextyear is fair. Produce will be 75 ^5025 or 30^ pr ct lowerthis winter than last, which will in fact be nearer thereal value than former prices.Our business—I mean the business of Woodruff & Smithhas been as good as we anticipated, and is increasingThe amount of our sales of Books & Stationery for thefirst year ending in September last was (over) 
 between Eleven and twelve thousand dollars, thisand when it is considered that we have done this withoutcapital and under the disadvantages incidental tothe establishment of a new house and have been ableto meet all our engagagements unassisted we challengeany establishment in the West to produce a better resultof first years opperations. If we have not profiteddirectly, I have not doubt we have established acharacter for business which is worth the trouble wehave been at to acquire.I am much interested in the amount of your success in the ministryand I hope continual success—commensurate with your talentsand application will be the reward of your labors. I thank youfor the information you give respecting that section of countrySuch intillegence will be always grateful to a mind whichdesires knowledge. Mr Smith my partner was in Illinoisnot long since—he saw one of the Derrings from Avon.Mr Derring mentioned you to him, told him that heheard you preach in South Canton and what wasmore silly than all added h that you were [page torn] [the worst]Preacher" he ever heard.

BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T.  April 5th 1888.Elder Joseph F. Smith, Washington, D. C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:A longer time has elapsed since our last communication to you than we intended; but we have been so engrossed with business and con-stant meetings of the Council that this is the first leisure we have had to send you a letter in acknow-ledgement of several that we have received from you. The following dispatch was sent to you yesterday:"Sayer write fully concerming your ar-rangements for emigration to Teasdale immediately. Through rate from Liverpool to Salt Lake fixed at fifty five dollars. Instruct Teasdale to collect through fares as usual and 
 pay them to Huntington agent at Liverpool and cableme amount to make up railroad fares and I will for-ward to Newport News. Request him to ascertain fare from Copenhagen and cable me."We hope it reached you safely and that you have been able to communicate fully with Brother Teas-dale (who seems greatly exercised concerning the emigration) so that he might be able to make his arrangements for transportation from the Continent. Several of his letters of late have been very strongly pleading against any change. I have written him to-day upon these points and explained to him the position and informed him that though Guions were our friends and we felt kindly disposed to them, yet this was not a matter of senti-ment, but of money. Our poor people were not able to pay large amounts and it was quite a consideration with us to have a low fare. Besides, Mr. Huntington had been an undeviating friend of ours for many years in political matters and had rendered us aid on many occasions, and always responded when called upon; so 
 that we were not leaving Guions to go to someone who had no regard for us. He seems to be troubled about transportation from the Continent and seems to think that no one can have the same advantages that the GuionsCo. has had in this respect. But before we engaged with the Guions Co. our people were brought from the Continent without any difficulty, and we presume by a little management they can again be transported toLiverpool in the same way.Malu (The news that you have written us con-cerning your interviews with Maude and Dellie has been very satisfactory. Their letters also have been quite encouraging, and Maude is particularly kind in his expressions concerning yourself and the associations they have had with you. We trust that their labors there have been of benefit and that the effect in our favor will be apparent to our brethren, without their knowing how these results are brought about. Maudewrites that he is overworked and almost broken down, 
 so we suppose he has had plenty to do for other parties as well as for us.)We regret that Brother John W. Young should feel oppressed either with monetary embarrassments or with any depression of mind. It certainly would have given everyone of his friends great pleasure to have seen him continue his labors in connection with yourself and the brethren, and not to have allowed any improper feel-ing to arise within him concerning our action as a committee, or yourself and the brethren as individuals. We certainly have had no feelings but those of theutmost kindness and friendliness towards him, and it has been a cause of regret that we should be com-pelled to say or do anything that would wound his feelings in the least degree.The statements which you make concern-ing your expenditures are quite satisfactory. How much more pleasant it would have been for all of us had Bro. John W. taken the same course that you have! 
 Malū(We can understand how the impression which Maudesays is prevalent respecting their being "millions" to buy up Congress should get out. The style in which Bro. John W. has moved and the lavish manner in which he has used means would naturally create such an impression and would operate against an economical campaign.)You ask what accounts you should con-sider as coming under the control of the Committee. The understanding you have got that Mr. Gibson and Mr. Curtis and the Republican are all arrangements outside of the State movement is correct. These gentle-men were employed and the arrangement was made with the Republican some time before the State move-ment was thought about, and whatever means havebeen paid out of the "Fund" to these parties should be separated from the "Fund" account and charged to the account to which they were formerly charged. Your own expenses, and the expenses of the brethren 
 engaged in the State movement, and whatever you pay out to newspapers or in other quarters which have a direct bearing and are connected with the State move-ment, should be charged to the "Fund." Whatever may be necesssary to expend in conducting the ordinary busi-ness such as has been heretofore done at sessions of Congress, should be placed in the accounts they were formerly charged to.The suggestions concerning the Elders of the Southern States were submitted to the Council and they seemed to feel reluctant about withdrawing them from the field entirely; but it was suggested that aletter be written to the President of the Southern States Mission, asking him to make his arrangements so that they would avoid laboring in places where hostility was excited or where unfavorable comments would be made by the press. I had, however, some little time ago, suggested to Elder Wm Spry, (who presides now over the Southern States Mission) this same line of 
 policy and called his attention to the position that we were occupying at the present time in endeavoringto get a State government, and how necessary it was that we should not create any more excitement in the South than possible, as some of our friends in Congress complained that their constituents wrote to them uponthe subject. This letter, when read to the Council, ap-peared to be quite satisfactory to them. I have since received a letter from Bro. Spry, in reply to mineupon this subject, in which he acquiesces and in-timates that he will carry out the policy suggested.^Attorneys—Malū x^ It is with great regret that we hear about the differences of views among our attorneys in regard to the proper method of conducting the Church suit. These differences weaken us very much and make us feel that our property is in great jeopardy. (Maudewrote and telegraphed to us concerning an appeal. He has appeared very anxious to have some plan sent to him which he could bring through influential 
 friends before the Attorney General, so that the way might be paved for carrying the case to the Supreme Court and stopping the ixamination here. The telegrams which we sent you contained this plan. We had Le Grand Young, Sheeks & Rawlins and Judge Sutherland meet with us and the dispatch that was sent you was framed by them. They did not seem very clear in their views about it; but Maude was so urgent to hear from us that it seemed too bad that we could not decide upon some way of getting this matter put in shape that would bring it before the U.S. Supreme Court for decision upon the constitutionality of the law. He wrote to us and gave us the names of influential parties that could be got to bring this matter before Garland. We urged this upon our attorneys here several times, but with no particular result until the night when we sent you the dispatch, when we insisted on something being given to us.) Of course, you will see before this reaches you that Bro. M. M. Sheets has been 
 sent to the penitentiary. They hope, by means of this case, through the merit of habeas corpus being broughtbefore the U. S. Supreme Court, that the vital pointswhich we wish to have decided can be reached. You inform us, however, in your recent letter that our attor-neys there have doubts even upon this point. Thisseems to surprise Bro. LeGrand Young; for he asserts that Col. Broadhead has written to him, asking whythe habeas corpus case has not been obtained. We aredoing the very best we can here, under the circumstances; but the probabilities are, from present appearances, that unless there should be something done to stop the operations, this investigation will take a very widerange and every transaction of the Church will be pryed into and, if possible, unsettled.We telegraphed you in regard to Pad-dock. You said that you did not know how to reach him. The U.P. people, doubtless, can check him, if anyone can, as they, no doubt, contributed to his 
 election and without their aid he would ^not^ have been where he is. Mr. Sidney Dillon has always mani- fested a kind feeling, and perhaps Messrs. Shellaberger& Wilson, who are in the employ of the U.P. people, might be able to furnish you some aid in getting this matter before Mr. Dillon or the U.P. people.We deserve some aid at their hands, and if they are appealed to properly they ought to render it.We hope you will be able to get along with the Woman's International Council without having any tirade against us. Your proposal to aid them is a good one and we hope you will be able to carry it out and to check any such ebullition as is threatened.We entirely approve of the price that you have offered Bro. John W. Young—$25000 per month—for your board and lodgings for the four months ending April 1st. We would like to see him satisfied and hope that anything you can do 
 to comply with his wishes, if they are not intirely too unreasonable, will be done by you.We join in love to you, and the brethren of the Council send their love. We constantly remem-ber you and uphold you in our faith and prayers, and trust you will be kept from the hands of all your enemies and be very successful in performing every duty that devolves upon you.We areYour Brethren, Wilford WoodruffGeo.

We have received the California Mail regularly up to this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the topof the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow,and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing throughthe most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex-perienced in these vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet hasfallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has lain for a month between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands& more North. All the stock have been brought from the Island, andsome from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, andsome to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there hasbeen but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter. Theabundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri-gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r]two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fallhas sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had aconstant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to graduallysoak into the soil. The inhabitants of this city have again commenced laborupon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and theyexpect to finish it by the opening of Spring. the inhabitants of DavisCounty have also commenced on a Canal to take out a portion of theWeber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a fewof the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince Hoy.as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we wouldalso wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bearin mind, the propriety of  bringing with them or forwarding as theymay have opportunity anychoice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will bea benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedlingstrawberries or any other good kinds & Lawton's blackberry, Catawba & Isabella Grapes,Indigo or madder or cotten seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane orMillet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seedsand grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite abenefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.The Reformation is progessing throughout this city and Territory withgreat interest. President Young has given much valuable information andteaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attendthe meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant onthe 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with hiscounsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernaclewas crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter andhundreds have to l[e]ave who cannot get into the house. the appearanceof Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months createda sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for aboutone hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to thepeople, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the heartsof the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful.He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses willappear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people forseveral Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 the parable of the vineyard, the vine &c., to illustrate his ideas, histeachings have been of much benefit to the Saints. The Twelve whowere here, have gone forward with the missionaries through every wardin the city, teaching the Elders and the people, meeting with the variousQuorums of the church, we have attended a meeting of some kind al-most every evening for three months. The people are rising up en masseand trying to live their religion, by confessing and forsaking their sins, and preparing for the waters of Baptism, the spirit and power ofGod is manifest in Zion. The word of the Lord through hisservants who are clothed with the power of God and the fire of theHoly Ghost causes the sinner to tremble and fearfulness to surprize thehypocrite, and the people universally feel like putting away sin andiniquity of every kind. all places of worship both in the city and countryare crowded to excess. The people are beginning more to feel the importanceof living their religion magnifying their calling and building up thekingdom of God. Their has been four of the quorum of the Twelve inthis city during the sitting of the Legislature viz. O Hyde, L. Snow,F. D. Richards & myself. Elder Hyde has now gone South on amission through the city and brother Snow is mostly confined to BoxElder. Elder Richards & myself remain in this city at present.we expect Elders A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us thisSpring.yours truly,W. Woodruff 
 Bro. Taylor. I have named in my letter that I wished toget the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel tosee something about it but not knowing that he will be ableto do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00and direct him to put up that amount, and send it toW. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will paythe money here in any way that you will order.W. W 
 TO THE SAINTS:To the officers and members of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, in General Conferenceassembled:Dear Brethren  and Sisters– EveryLatter-day Saint will recognize thevalue of union, not only in action butin the matters of faith and discipline. As to the rights and authority of thePriesthood of the Son of God, it is ofthe highest importance of opinionamong the officers and members of theChurch of  Jesus Chr[i]st of Latter-day Saints. Feeling the necessity if a cor-rect understanding of this prin-ciple, we deem it proper at this sixty-sixth anniversary of the organization of the Church in theselast days, to prepare and present state-ment on the subject, embodying the doctrine which has always prevailedin the Church, and our views upon it.We are prompted to adopt this courseat the present time because of eventswhich have happened during the latepolitical contest. A great diversity of opinion on the subject has been ex-pressed, and even by leading Elders inthe Church, which latter fact hasnaturally led in some instances to considerable division of sentiment.It is of great importance that we un-derstand each other and that there be harmony in our teachings. It is espec-ially important that these teachingsshall be in accordance with the rulesand regulations and doctrines whichhave been taught and which have pre-vailed from the beginning until thepresent time, having not only thesanction of undisputed usage, but the approval of all faithful leaders in theChurch and of Him in whose nameand by whose authority they act.In the late exciting contest, to whichreference has been made, the presidingauthorities in some instances have beenmisunderstood. In other instances they have been misrepresented,which has led to a wrongfulconception of their real views.It has been asserted too freely,and without foundation, that there hasbeen a disposition on their part to in-terfere with individual liberty and to rebuke in some men a course which was applauded in others. In a word,that they have appeared to desire toassert and maintain an unjust and op-pressive control over the actions of the members of the Church, and in thusdoing have endeavored to effect aUnion of Church and State. In theheat of political discussion,  asser-tions have been made and ar-guments used conveying to the pub-[l]ic mind a false idea concerning 
 the position of the officers of theChurch, and leaving the impres-sion that there has been and wasnow being made an attempt to ac-complish the union above referred to.Now that the excitement has passed,and calmer reason has resumed itssway, we think it prudent to set forth,so that all may understand, the exactposition occupied by the leading au-thorities of the Church.In the first place we wish to state inthe most positive and emphatic lan-guage that at no time has there everbeen any attempt or even desire on thepart of the leading authorities referredto to have the Church in any mannerencroach upon the rights of the State, or to unite in any degree the functionsof the one with those of the other.Peculiar circumstances have sur-rounded the people of Utah. For manyyears a majority of them in every por-tion of the Territory belonged to oneChurch, every reputable memberof which was entitled to hold and[old] some ecclesiastical office. Itis easy to see how, to the casual ob-server, it might appear singular thatso many officers of the Church werealso officers of the State; but whilethis was in fact the case, the distinc-tion between the Church and the Statethroughout those years was carefullymaintained. The President of the Church held for eight years the high-est civil office in the community,having been appointed by the nationaladministration governor of the Ter-ritory. The first secretary of the Terr-tory was a prominent Church official.An Apostle represented the Territoryin Congress as a delegate during tenyears. The members of the Legisla-ture held also offices in the Church.This was unavoidable; for the mostsuitable men were elected by the votes of the people, and, as we have stated,every reputable man in the entire com-munity held some Church position,the most energetic and capable hold-ing leading positions. This is allnatural and plain enough to those who consider the cir-cumstances; but it furnished oppor-tunity for those who were disposed to assail the people of the Territory tocharge them with attempting to uniteChurch and State. A fair investigationof the conditions will abundantly dis-prove the charge and show its utterfalsity.On behalf of the Church of which weare leading officers, we desire again tostate to the members and also to thepublic generally, that there has notbeen, not is there, the remotest desireon our part or on the part of our co-religionists to do anything looking to aunion of Church and State.We declare that there has never beenany attempt to curtail individualliberty – the personal liberty of any ofthe officers or members of the Church.The First Presidency and other lead-ing officers did make certain sugges-tions to the people when the division on party lines took place. That move-ment was an entirely new departure,and it was necessary, in order that thefull benefit should not be lostwhich was hoped to result fromthis new political division,that people who were inexperi-enced should be warned against hastyand ill-considered action. In somecases they were counseled to be wiseand prudent in the political stepsthey were about to take, and this withno idea of winning them against theirwill to either side. To this extent, and no further, was anything said or doneupon this question, and at no time andunder no circumstances was any attemptmade to say to voters how they shouldcast their ballots. Any charge thathas been made to the contrary is ut-terly false.Concerning officers of the Churchthemselves, the feeling was generallyexpressed in the beginning of the po-litical division spoken of that it wouldbe prudent for leading men not to ac-cept of office at the hands of the po-litical party to which they might be-long. This counsel was given to menof both parties alike – not because itwas thought that there was any impro-priety in religious men holding civiloffice, not to deprive them of any ofthe rights of citizenship, but becauseof the feeling that it would be betterunder all the circumstances which hadnow arisen to avoid any action thatwould be likely to create jealousy and ill-feeling. An era of peace andgood-will seemed to be dawning uponthe people, and it was deemed good toshun everything that could have the least tendency to prevent the con-summation of this happy pros-pect. In many instances, how-ever, the pressure brought tobear upon efficient and popular menby the members of the parties to whichthey belonged was of such a characterthat they had to yield to the solicitationto accept nomination to office, or sub-ject themselves to the suspicion of badfaith in their party affiliations. Insome cases they did this without con-sulting the authorities of the Church;but where important positions wereheld, and where the duties were of aresponsible and exacting character,some did seek the counsel and ad-vice of the leading Church authoritiesbefore accepting the political honorstendered them. Because some othersdid not seek this counsel and advice,ill-feeling was engendered, and undueand painful sensitiveness was stimu-lated; misunderstanding readily fol-lowed and as a result the authoritiesof the Church were accused of badfaith and made the subjects of bitterreproach. We have maintained thatin the case of men who hold highpositions in the Church, whose dutiesare well defined, and whose ec-clesiastical labors are understoodto be continuous and necessary,it would be an improper thing to ac-cept political office or enter into anyvocation that would distract or removethem from the religious duties restingupon them, without first consultingand obtainig the approval of their associates and those who preside overthem. It has been understood fromthe very beginning of the Church thatno officer whose duties are of the character referred to, has the right to engage in any pursuit, political orotherwise, that will divide his time and remove his attention from the callingalready accepted. It has been theconstant practice with officers of theChurch to consult—or, to use our lan-guage, to "counsel"—with  their breth-ren concerning all questions of thiskind. They have not felt that theywere sacrificing their manhood in do-ing so, nor that they were submittingto improper dictation, nor that in so-liciting and acting upon the adviceof those over them, theywere in any manner doingaway with their individual rights andagency, nor that to any improper de-gree were their rights and duties asAmerican citizens being abridged or interfered with. They realized thatin accepting ecclesiastical office theyassumed certain obligations; thatamong these was the obligation tomagnify the office which they held, toattend to the duties in preference to every other labor, and to devote them-selves exclusively to it with all thezeal, industry and strength theypossessed, unless released inpart or for a time by thosewho preside over them. Our view, andit has been the view of all our prede-cessors, is that no officer of our Church, especially those in high standing,should take a course to violate this long-established practice. Rather thandisobey it, and declare himself by hisactions defiantly independent of hisassociates and his file leaders, it hasalways been held that it would bebetter for a man to resign the duties ofhis Priesthood: and we entertain thesame view today.In view of all the occurrences to whichreference has been made, and to thediversity of views that have arisenamong the people in consequence, we 
 feel it to be our duty to clearly defineour position, so there may be no causehereafter for dispute or controversyupon the subject.First—We unanimously agree to andpromulgate as a rule that should al-ways be observed in the Churchand by every leading officialthereof, that before accepting anyposition, political or otherwise,which would interfere with the properand complete discharge of his ecclesi-astical duties, and before accepting anomination or entering into engage-ments to perform new duties, saidofficial should apply to the proper au-thorities and learn from them whetherbe can, consistently with the obliga-tions already entered into with theChurch upon assuming his office, takeupon himself the added duties andlabors and responsibilities of the newposition. To maintain proper disciplineand order in the Church, we deemthis absolutely necessary; and in as-serting this rule, we do not considerthat we are infringing in the least de-gree upon the individual rights of thecitizen. Our position is that a manhaving accepted the honors and oblige-tions of ecclesiastical office in theChurch cannot properly of his ownvolition make those honors subordi-nate to or even co-ordinate which newones of  an entirely different character;we hold that unless he is willing tocounsel with and obtain the con-sent of his fellow-laborers and presid-ing officers in the Priesthood, heshould be released from all obligationsassociated with the latter, before ac-cepting any new position.Second—We declare that in makingthese requirements of ourselves andour brethren in the ministry, we donot in the least desire to dictate tothem concerning, or to interfere withthe affairs of the State; neither do weconsider that in the remotestdegree we are seeking theunion of Church and State. Weonce more here repudiate the insinua-tion that there is or ever has been anattempt by our leading men to trespassupon the ground occupied by the State,or that there has been or is the wishcurtail in any manner any of its func-tions.Your brethren,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO.

 ELDERS JOURNALVinalhaven, Fox Islands, Me.March 9th, 1838.BISHOP EDWARD PARTRIDGE, and PRESI-DENTS JOSEPH SMITH JR., SIDNEY RIGDON,HYRUM SMITH, and THE SAINTS IN ZION,GREETING:Dear friends in the new and everlastingcovenant;I, Willford Woodruff, sit down to inform you, that I have just heard, correctly, of the deplorable state of things in Kirtland, and I have this day held a council with Elders J. Ball and J. Townsend, who are now with me upon these Islands, and we resolved to address a few lines to you concern-ing our feelings, and set before you a brief account of things with us, and the course we intend to pursue. I have labored principally alone upon these Islands, since Elder Hale left last fall, and the work of the Lord has prosper-ed in my hands, or in other words, the Lord has worked with me during the winter. Elder Joseph Ball has been with me for a number of weeks past upon the Islands. There is rising of 40 members in the church on these Isl-ands, and they are strong in the faith. I returned last evening from a mission in company with Elder James Town-send. we have been visiting the most notable cities and vilages in the eastern country, and delivering unto them the word of God.We preached in their City Halls, Chapels, School houses, dwellings &c., in such places as Camden, Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hampden and the City of Bangor. Doors were open in all of these places, and many others I might mention, and the people heard with profound attention; and many are believing. I never saw more doors open for doing good, than at the pres-ent time in the State of Maine: But the Devil is stired up against me here on the Island.One Methodist priest has applied several times for a warrant to take me, but the Officers, as yet, will not grant him any, for he cannot bring any ac-cusation against me in truth or justice.The most trouble I now have, is the stopping the papers. I have forwarded about 30 subscribers with the money, and now the press is burnt down, and our enemies roar in the midst of the congregations, and they set up these ensigns for signs.I expect the report of these things will come like a clap of thunder in the ears of the Saints upon these Islands and else where. They do not know it yet, but are wondering why these pa-pers do not come. We have appointed a time to meet the church, and we shall lay all these things before them and trust in God for wisdom to direct us. The Elders that are with me are expecting to go to their homes, and I shall be left to fight the battles alone. Brethren, pray for me out of Zion, for I have a load to bear; but in the name of Elijah's God, I am determined to stand at my post. I feel as though the time of Jacob's trouble had began, but I know God will deliver him out of it, and fulfil his word.We are advising the Saints of God to go from this country to Zion, as soon as they can. I suppose this is right: many are preparing to go the following season.Now we say to the Presidency of the church in Zion; we do not expect to counsel you, nor any one there, let God be your counselors. But we ask, can it not be consistent with the will of God and your feelings and circum-stances, to soon publish the Elders'Journal from Zion, that we may have one weapon, to cut away some of the deep gloom, that will be cast upon the minds of thousands of the Saints, by wicked men and devils, and false breth-ren. The traveling Elders feel the wait of these things, equally, if not more than those who are in Zion; for we are naked targets to the press and tongue, as we pass through the midst of the Gentiles. O my God! have mercy and support us, I pray, through the toils that are to come, that our gar-ments may be washed white in the blood of the Lamb! for it is through tribulation that we inherit the blessing and overcome.Could the Elders' Journal be contin-ued, it would be great relief to the feel-ings of all the faithful; for while our enemies are publishing against us, even in Kirtland, we should also know what God is doing for his Saints.Brethren, we pray you to consider this last clause, not for our sake alone, but for the sake of all the faithful that are scattered abroad. We do not make these remarks because we have any lack of confidence in you—No. God forbid, we believe you have done, and will do all that lies in your power for 
 ELDERS JOURNALthe salvation of Israel; and for one, I pray God to take away my life, sooner than to suffer me to turn my back upon the faithful part of the church of Latter Day Saints, and Joseph whom God hath chosen to lead his people. O my soul mourns over the corruptions of the hearts of men! O how man will stum-ble in dark places, when he neglects prayer and departs from his God! O ye Saints of Zion, watch and pray, and keep the Celestial law, which is safe!That you may know the feelings of the undersigners of this page, we say to you before God, that we are in full fellowship with Joseph Smith jr. and the first Presidency of the church, and with all who still adhere to, and receive their teachings and instructions; and we say, in the name of Jesus Christ, that we will uphold such by our pray-ers, faith, and influence, at the risk of our fortunes, lives, and worldly honor. "For life is but a name, when virtue and truth is gone."We further believe, that judgment awaits the world speedily, Kirtland not excepted, and we do believe that those who have dissented from the body of the church, will have cause to lament for their folly. We ask in the name of reason and revelation, who has power to take from Joseph, the keys delivered to him by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and deprive him of the work that God has said he should per-form? We answer, none but God alone. We believe the book of Mor-mon and Doctrine and Covenants, speaks too loud upon the subject, to fall unfulfilled and to be made void, by those who have neglected prayer, and departed from the living God, and sought to take honor unto themselves.  O ye Saints of God in Zion! we en-treat you to uphold Joseph by prayer, faith, brotherly love, and charity: for we testify, in the Spirit of God, that he will be brought off conqueror, and his enemies put to shame.Do you remember his toils and la-bors for your salvation? Nothing but a God has supported him to the present day. His perils are great, and the greatest are among false brethren; and we do entreat the Saints in Zion not to add to his wounds, by following the example of many in Kirtland.—Bear with us, ye Saints of God, while we exhort you to keep the Celestial law of God, while in the land of Zion.Be humble, be watchful, be prayerful. Beware of pride, lest you fall like oth-ers. We do not make these remarks for compliment sake, we feel what we say. Kirtland is and will be scourged, to fulfill revelation and prophecy; it is all right, the hand of God is in it.  God's work will not stop. He will work for, and with his Saints. God will redeem Jacob. God will build up Zion. The Lord will establish Jerusa-lem. And O ye Judges in Zion! that God may bestow wisdom and salvation upon you, is the prayer ofWILFORD WOODRUFF,JAMES TOWNSEND, &JOSEPH BALL.

 [stamp] BRIGHAM YOUNG COLLEGE, LOGAN, UTAH.CIRCULAR No. 7.(Circular Addressed by the General Church Board of Education toPresidents of Stakes, June 8th, 1888.)Dear Brethren: A meeting of the General Board of Educa-tion was held today, and the subject of the educational interests ofthe Latter-day Saints was taken into consideration and discussed atsome length.It was decided that a Board of Education, consisting of notless than five and not to exceed eight in number, should be selectedin each Stake to take charge of and promote the interests of edu-cation in the Stake.This communication is addressed to you to inform you of this action, and to have you select energetic men who are friends ofeducation, who understand the needs of the people, and who haveinfluence with the Saints, to carry out any suggestions in this direc-tion that may be deemed desirable.In the decision which was reached by our General Board, it was made the duty of these local Boards to take into consideration the formation of Church Schools, and the best method of accom-plishing this, and after arriving at proper conclusions, to report themto the General Board.Communications of this character may be addressed to Elder George Reynolds, who is Secretary of the Board.It was felt by the General Board that, to begin with, there shouldbe one Stake Academy established in each Stake as soon as practi-cable.The education of our children under correct influences and in the spirit of the gospel ought to be very dear to every Latter-day 
 Saint, and we are impressed that the time has arrived for a com-mencement to be made in this direction.The desire is universally expressed by all thinking people inthe Church, that we should have schools wherein the Bible, the Bookof Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants can be usedas class books, and wherein the principles of our religion may forma part of the teaching of the schools.To effect this it will be necessary that funds be collected. TheChurch will doubtless do its share; but it cannot carry the entireburden. The Saints must be appealed to.There are hundreds of liberal-minded people among us whoare willing to contribute to this worthy object when they find thesubject is receiving due attention, and that definite and perma-nent arrangements are being made to establish schools of thischaracter.The brethren whom you select to form this Board should be men of character and integrity among the people, who will be able to use an influence in the collection of funds, so that schools maybe established, good faculties be employed, and tuition be made socheap that an education will be within the reach of the humblest inthe land.After you have made a suitable selection for this Board, thenames of the brethren composing it should be presented regularly atyour Stake Conferences as other authorities are, so that the peoplecan vote for them.Very respectfully yours,WILFORD WOODRUFF,Chairman of the Church Board of Education.GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary. 
 To the Presidents of Stakes, Stake and Local Boards of Education, andPrincipals and Faculties of all Church Schools:At the commencement of our labors as the General Board ofEducation, the peculiar condition of the Church affairs compelled us to be careful in holding out hopes of financial aid in the organ-izing of new schools; we therefore confined ourselves to the an-nouncement of some of the principles upon which it would be desirable to have our new educational system organized and con-ducted. But the active energy displayed by so many of the Stakesof Zion, in response to our first circular, not only in organizingtheir respective Boards, but also in proceeding at once to raise sub-scriptions to procure furniture and apparatus, and to call for Princi-pals and Teachers, furnishes proof that the time is ripe for the in-troduction of this new educational system, and that the people areready to sustain and carry it out. Applications for assistance tohelp institutions already started and to start others are numerous;but the Board is not, at present, in a position to give all the aidasked for, and must, of necessity, proceed carefully in its disburse-ments.However, we have an unfaltering faith that the Spirit whichprompted the inception of this system of education, will assist inthe progress of the work; until, by united effort, patient presever-ance, sincere devotion, intelligent application, and firm reliance up-on the blessings of God, all our difficulties will be gradually over-come, and our educational affairs be placed upon a satisfactory basisin all the Stakes of Zion.Although the attainment of so desirable an end requires itstime of development, there are a few points within reach, to whichwe desire to call your attention.1st. It is essential that this Board receive an Annual Finan-cial Statement from the Treasurer of each Church School, with suchother items as will more perfectly explain the financial condition ofthe institution, on or before July 15th, of each year. This state- 
 ment should be endorsed by an auditing committee, and counter-signed by the President and Secretary of the Board.2. In connection with the above, we also desire an Annual Statistical Report, signed by the President and Secretary of theBoard, and by the Principal and Secretary of the Faculty.3. The General Superintendent, under instructions from theGeneral Board, will communicate directly with the Principals andTeachers for the purpose of harmonizing their labors in such amanner as will insure to the youth of Zion the greatest amount ofgood, and to the Teachers a sufficient scope for their individuality.4. It will, doubtless, be productive of better results for thePrincipals of the different Stake Academies or Colleges to beappointed by the General Board upon the recommendation of theGeneral Superintendent; yet this will only be done after consulta-tion with the respective Stake Boards to the end that their wishesmay be fully satisfied. The other Teachers should be appointed by the Stake Boards, upon the recommendation of the Principal.5. The system of teaching inaugurated at the Brigham YoungAcademy, of Provo, is that which we wish introduced in all ourChurch Schools.6. All communications between the General Board and Gen-eral Superintendent on the one side, and the Stake Boards orPrincipals and Teachers on the other, should be kept on file forreference.7. The General Superintendent will be instructed by thisBoard to visit the schools at certain intervals, to meet with the res-pective Boards and Faculties, to give instructions and to make suchenquiries as will enable him to render us complete reports from timeto time.CONVENTIONS.All Church Schools are organized into District Conventionsaccording to instructions published in the Juvenile Instructor. TheChairman of each convention will be appointed by the GeneralBoard.An Annual Convention will be held at Salt Lake City, at which all Church Schools should be officially represented. 
 BOARD OF EXAMINERS.A Board of Examiners has been created by the General Board.This Board of Examiners may call to its aid any specialists, as cir-cumstances may require, subject, however, to the approval of the General Board.Course of Procedure Relative to the Examination of Church School Instruc-tors and the Awarding of Certificates and Diplomas.No teacher is eligible to act in any Church School who doesnot hold a License or Certificate from the General Board of Educa-tion.Licenses and Certificates may be obtained under the followingconditions:Annual Licenses. Teachers of at least one year's practical ex-perience, or graduates from one of our Normal Schools, desiring to enter the Church School service, should make written application to the General Superintendent. They should in this applicationpromise to teach in accordance with the instructions given by theGeneral Board of Education. They should enclose their Bishops'Certificates of Church standing, and any testimonials or certificatesof efficiency they may have. If such documents are satisfactory,an Annual License for either the Primary or the IntermediateGrade may be issued, pending examination before the Board of Ex-aminers for a standing certificate in the respective grade.Upon the recommendation of the Board of Examiners, Stand-ing Certificates will be issued by the General Board for the PrimaryGrade, for the Intermediate Grade, and to Specialists for their particu-lar branches, and Diplomas for the Academic Grade, to all successfulcandidates.The title of Professor will be recognized as applicable in ChurchSchools to those only who hold Academic diplomas as specifiedabove.The Board of Examiners will give public notice of the dates and places of annual examinations at least four weeks previousthereto.Candidates for a degree in any of our Academic courses must give notice of their intention to the General Superintendent at least two months before their examination.

In too many instances, in the course of the years, this grand object has been lost sight of in the toil for daily exist-ence, and less noble aims have largely taken the place of the en-deavor to learn the ways of the Lord and of the effort to walk in His paths. This benumbing influence on our spiritual life is widely felt in our homes, and more particularly affects our children, whose faith in the great latter-day work has not been developed and strengthened by the experience which their elders have had in lands beyond the borders of Zion. Nor does the training which our youth receive in the District Schools increase their feelings of devo-tion to God and love for His cause, for, as is well known, all teach- 
 ings of a religious character are rigorously excluded from the stud-ies permitted in these institutions.To lessen this great evil, and counteract the tendencies that grow out of a Godless education, the Church schools of the Saints have been established. But while these accomplish great good, the sphere of their usefulness does not cover the entire field. There are many places where Church schools cannot, at present, be estab-lished; and also many Saints in those places where such schools ex-ist, who, for various reasons, cannot send their children thereto. For these causes we have deemed it prudent to suggest to the vari-ous local authorities other measures which, while not occupying the place of the Church Schools, will work on the same lines, and aid in the same work in which the Church educational institutions are en-gaged.We suggest that in every ward where a Church school is not established, that some brother or sister, or brethren and sisters, well adapted for such a responsible position by their intelligence and devotion, as well as their love for the young, be called, as on a mis-sion, by the Bishop, after consultation with the President of the Stake, to take charge of a school wherein the first principles of the Gospel, Church history, and kindred subjects shall be taught. This school to meet for a short time each afternoon after the close of the district school, or for a longer time on the Saturday only, as may in each ward be deemed most consistent with the situation of the peo-ple and most likely to secure a good attendance of the children. In some cases it will be found that the children are too wearied after their usual daily studies to take interest in a class of this kind; in others, Saturday may prove to be an unsuitable day.Where arrangements can be made it will, as a general thing, be well to secure the district school room for this purpose, so that when they take place in the afternoon, these exercises can commence im-mediately after the regular sessions and before the children scatter; but where this is done care must be taken to keep the two entirely separate, so that the law may not be infringed upon. Where the regular school room cannot be obtained, some building conveniently situated, and as near as possible, should be secured in its stead; the object being to secure the attendance, as far as possible, of the chil-dren of all the Latter-day Saints. A strenuous effort should likewise 
 be made to gain the hearty co-operation of the parents, as without their aid the school will measurably fail in the object of its crea-tion.We deem it desirable that every school thus established should be under the guidance and direction of the General Board of Edu-cation; and those brethren and sisters who accept this call will re-ceive a license from the Board to act in this capacity. Suggestions with regard to the studies, etc., will also be issued by the General Board, and other means be adopted to place these classes in harmony with the methods of the Church School system, of which, in fact, they will form an important part. Where it is found necessary to pay the teacher a small stipend for his services, the General Board of Education should be consulted through the State Board; but it is thought that the incidental expenses for fuel, etc., may, without inconvenience, be met by the ward, or by the people whose children are benefited.With a constant desire for the progress of all true education, we remain, with much respect,Your brethren in the Gospel,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON,JOS. F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.In accordance with the foregoing circular, the General Board of Education has selected the Juvenile Instructor as the official organ of communication for these Religion Classes and for all our Church Schools. The first number in each month will be used as the medium of Church School papers.It is essential that such copies of the Juvenile Instructor be kept on file for reference in all Church Schools and Religion Classes.CONDUCTING OF CHURCH SCHOOLS.The Academic Year.The General Board has been informed that a few of our Stake Boards intend to continue their schools only part of the academic 
 year. As no efficient teacher can be expected to accept such a tem-porary engagement, it is obvious that these schools would have to depend on "makeshift" arrangements, to the detriment of their pupils and in opposition to the high aim of our educational system. We, therefore, desire that Stake Academies make no deviation from the regular academic year of forty weeks without consulting the General Superintendent.Buildings and Furniture.The General Board of Education has repeatedly been asked to furnish plans for school buildings, but in consideration of the variety of conditions, plans generally applicable can not be furnished. We call the attention of the Boards of Education to the fact that an elaborate architectural edifice is not essential for a successful school, but that the consideration of the teachers' support, the health and the comfort of students, and the condition of school furniture and uten-sils is of far greater importance.Circulars.Several of the circulars heretofore published by Stake and Local Boards have not been in conformity with the instructions of the General Board. We urge upon you the necessity of care in this respect, and recommend that you correspond with the General Superintendent before introducing any essential variation.Principals and Faculties.Members of faculties, Principals excepted, should not hold office in the Stake Boards. Principals are "ex-officio" members of their respective Stake Boards.In order to regulate the somewhat irregular mode of cor-respondence that has been carried on between the Principals and the General Superintendent, it is found necessary to have at least one official communication per term from each Principal to the General Superintendent, furnishing such information as may enable the latter to properly represent the respective institution in his re-ports to the President of the General Board.The Principals will please furnish the General Superintendent 
 a complete list of their regular and special teachers, with respective curricula, salaries, length of service in the institution, and all other data of interest.Should a new department be organized or an old one be dis-continued in any Stake Academy or Seminary by the Local Board, such action should be reported to the General Superintendent.When Missionary Meetings and Polysophical Societies are organized, care must be taken that the interests of Sunday Schools and Mutual Improvement Associations be not interfered with, but rather that the influence of our teachers be directed to in support of those institutions.The General Superintendent should be furnished with copies of the Daily Programs, and Principals' Reports. Suggestions tend-ing to bring gradually our whole educational system into an har-monious whole will be gladly received. He should also be notified, at a reasonably early date, of every public examination to be held.Teachers' Salaries.The amount of salaries for Principals and Teachers is left, at present,  to mutual agreement between the respective Boards and Teachers, but care must be taken that the terms to be made upon the basis of strict business principles, and they be honorably adhered to.Libraries.Each Church School should have the following books in its Libra-ry, as they are considererd indispensable: 1. Unabridged Dictionary.  2. Encyclopedia. 3. All the standard Church works and publi-cations. 4. Popular text books in all branches taught, beside those adopted, for reference, by teachers and students. 5. Revised Laws of Utah. 6. Ordinances of the city in which the institution is located. 7. History of the World.Current Literature.— 1. We recommend that each institution keep the Deseret News, Juvenile Instructor, and local papers, also one or more educational, scientific, and literary magazines.A catalogue of all books and papers should be strictly kept and the books classified. In connection with the Library there should be a Reading Room. 
 Cabinets.A cabinet of specimens, for illustration, is indispensable to the study of the sciences.Valuable specimens may be obtained:—by excursions to mountains, caves, mines, factories, gardens, fields and places of note; also by exchanges of duplicates, and by contributions from patrons, students, and missionaries abroad. The specimens should be correctly classified, labeled and catalogued.Pieces of apparatus, such as cannot be made under the super-vision of the teacher, may be obtained advantageously by consulting with the Principals of our Colleges.Records.Besides the blanks for the Statistical and Financial Annual Reports, furnished by the General Board, the following records are deemed necessary to be kept with the greatest care, by the respec-tive Principals and their assistants:1. General or Annual Record with accompanying Index, con-taining name, age, parentage, home, time of entering, depart-ments, attendance during each term, Church standing, remarks, etc., of each pupil.2. Records of Plans and Programs containing the grading and plans for all courses and classes for each term of the school year.3. Register of Studies, containing the reports of the class work per week.4. Minutes of Faculty, containing also the Principal's Reports, Programs of Examination, and Minutes of Academic Councils.5. Records of Standing, containing the percentage of standing of the students in their respective departments and classes; from which every parent or guardian should be furnished an abstract at the end of the term.6. Teachers' Records of Daily Attendance and Preparation.NOTE.—The mode of keeping some of these records will have to be left optional with each Principal, provided that the records themselves are kept, subject to the inspection of the General Superintendent at his periodical visits.Historical Records.The importance of keeping historical records of our Church 
 School organization can not be over-estimated, and in order that the Church Historian be in a position to keep an accurate record of our educational movement, the General Superintendent is required to furnish him annually a summary from the special reports of the various Church Schools. The special report of each institution should be drawn up by the Principal thereof, and, after being endorsed by the President and Secretary of the respective Boards, should be sent to the General Superintendent on or before July 15, every year.Lady Teachers.We urgently recommend that each of our Church Schools have the benefit of a Lady Teacher not only qualified to instruct inthe common branches, but also able to conduct ladies' work, have special charge of the lady students, and, if possible, be acquainted with the principles of  Physiology, Hygiene, Domestic Science, Drawing, Music, and Kindergarten work.General Circular No. 6 contains particulars for the guidance of our Lady Teachers.Music Teachers.Great importance should be attached to the cultivation of Music in our Church Schools. It is, therefore, recommended that the various Boards of Education make it their special care to procure competent Music Teachers.Theology.Having learned of the great success attending the use of the Sunday School Leaflets and Picture Charts in the Primary and Preparatory, of the "Story of the Book of Mormon" in the Interme-diate, and of the Juvenile Instructor in all of these departments in some of our schools, the General Board recommends the adoption of these publications throughout our Church School organization, in addition to the text-books already in use. It is the intention of the Church Authorities to cause other theological works to be pre-pared with special reference to the needs of our Church Schools.Discipline.A judicious teacher will rarely have occasion to supplant emu-lative means of discipline by compulsory ones. 
 Academic Councils.—In serious cases of misdemeanor, or when all available means of discipline have been exhausted, the Principal may refer the case to the action of an Academic Council, accord-ing to the following procedure: The Principal should notify in writing the President of his Board, and request the summoning of an Academic Council to try the case. The President should ap-point a meeting of that Council at the earliest possible convenience, and cause the parents or guardians of the defendant to be notified also of the time and place of the trial. The Academic Council should be composed of at least three members of the Board, and the Principal and regular teachers of the school. The President, or some other member of the Board, appointed by the former for the occasion, presiding. Copies of the charge and the minutes of the proceedings must be kept on record. In case of expulsion, no such defendant can enter any other Church School until forgiveness from the Academic Council that expelled him has been obtained.  The General Superintendent must be notified of all such cases. The spirit and mode of procedure in the High Councils should be taken as a pattern on all such occasions.No Principal or Teacher has a right to expel a student from school without the action of the Academic Council.GRADING OF DEPARTMENTS.No student should be considered qualified to enter any depart-ment unless able to pursue successfully at least two of the studies enumerative under "GRADING," in such department.Primary Department.GRADING.—Chart Class to II Readers. Elementary Arithmetic, as far as Division. Simple Lessons in Language.CURRICULUM.—Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi-tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing, Object Lessons, Singing, Ladies' Work, and Calisthenics.Preparatory Department.GRADING.—III and IV Readers. Arithmetic,—Numbers to end of Fractions. Graded Lessons in English. 
 CURRICULUM.—Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi-tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing, Singing, Elementary Natural History, Hygiene, Ladies' Work, Calisthenics.Intermediate Department.GRADING.—V Readers and Elocution. Pract. Arith., Com-pound Nos. to end of text-book. Higher Lessons in English.CURRICULUM.—(Obligatory:) Theology, Grammar and Com-position, Reading, Arithmetic, Physical or Descriptive Geography, Orthography, Penmanship, Ladies' Work (for lady students), U. S. History and Hygiene.Optional: Vocal Music, Elementary Book-keeping.Text-books and books of reference used: Bible, Book of Mor-mon, Doctrine and Covenants, School Dictionary.Text-books in the Primary, Preparatory and Intermediate Departments should be wherever possible those adopted officially in the District Schools of the respective Stake or County, in order to avoid unnecessary expenses to the pupils.Academic Department.Church Schools, properly authorized to conduct academic classes, or to organize Academic Departments, will be guided by the instructions regarding academic courses and branches.Suggestive Plan for the Theological Course.Students should be graded according to age, Church standing and previous training in Theology. Thus it may happen that students of the Preparatory or Intermediate grades be entered in the Academic class in Theology, and vice versa.Primary: Simple stories from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and Church History.Preparatory: Life of Christ, Acts of the Apostles, and Book of Mormon History.Intermediate: Selections from Doctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon, and synopsis of the books of the Bible.Academic: A systematic and somewhat exhaustive study of the principles and ordinances of the Gospel as arranged in the Compen- 
 dium, alternating with Church History and Book of Mormon Chronology. Students should be supplied with the standard works of the Church. The Authorities have in contemplation the issu-ance of a special work for use in Academic theological classes.Besides daily recitations on the above subjects.Devotional Exercises should be held morning and evening:General Repetition Classes should be held weekly, and the stu-dents divided into small quorums to review the past week's work in Theology.Priesthood Meetings should be organized to hear repetition re-ports and to acquaint the members more fully with the duties and organization of the Priesthood.A General Theological Class should be held weekly, in which all departments should participate, and interesting programs be rendered.In all grades, however, it should be the main object of the teachers to cultivate in the hearts of their pupils a living testimony of the truth of the latter-day work.THE DOMESTIC FEATURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.In regard to our Domestic Regulations, of such potent influence in forming the character of the students, the Boards and Faculties will consider the circumstances of their localities, and advance step by step in the introduction of rules, which will assist them in the accomplishment of the object of the glorious mission given to us for the elevation of the youth of Zion. Such regulations should not be fetters to obstruct the exercise of free agency, but stakes to indicate the road to the attainment of the virtues of self-control and sense of duty.A leading feature of the Church School system is the cultiva-tion of the character and the control of the deportment of the stu-dent in and out of school. All students, on entering any of our schools, should be placed upon their word of honor to observe con-scientiously the rules and regulations of the school. A bi-weekly meeting should be held, in which the reports of visitors appointed by the Principal should be received, and general instructions be given pertaining to the behavior and well-being of the students. 
 These regulations are suggested, in the spirit of deepest kind-ness toward the students, and are the outgrowth of experience, and a redemption of the pledge given to the people, that students from abroad shall be as carefully cared for while attending our schools as they have been at home.Regulations.All students should be made subject to the Domestic Regula-tions in and out of school.Profanity and obscenity in any form should be strictly forbid-den.The use of tobacco or of strong drink should not be allowed.Students should not attend public or private parties without per-mission from the Principal.No student should choose a boarding or lodging place against the approval of the Principal.Students should be visited occasionally by representatives of the Principal.No student should discontinue attendance without obtaining from the Principal specifications of standing.Students irregular in their habits, keeping late hours, having improper associates, or visiting any places of questionable repute, should be placed under special restrictions.STUDENTS' OR POLYSOPHICAL SOCIETIES.These societies should be in special charge of one of the reg-ular teachers. Their object is to afford recreation and opportuni-ties for acquiring general information, practice in public speaking and acquaintance with parliamentary usage. Evening meetings may be held once per week, at which lectures, readings, recitations, musical exercises and like may be rendered; the public to be cordially invited.This being an educational movement, it behooves us, as officers of this organization, to keep in mind the golden rule of all educa-tion, viz.: "That no one can give what he does not possess him-self." Let us all, therefore, be prompt, punctual, and reliable in 
 our various places and duties, and rather resign than retard theprogress of the work by any neglect of ours.W. WOODRUFF, Prest.In behalf of the General Board of Education of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.KARL G. MAESER, D.L.D.,General Superintendent.GEO. REYNOLDS, Secretary.

My opinion of Brother Trejo's efficiency as a teacher, as also upon the successwhich has attended his labors with our students in Spanish, I have already expressed toyou. He seems well satisfied with the arrangements of the past, in matters of salary.He dislikes the thought of having to abandon the work altogether, and return to unsuit-able labor for a livelihood, during the summer vacation, and says he would be well satis-fied with half pay until the next school year opens. This, I believe, covers the extentof the enquiries you directed me to make. I trust the answers will be satisfactory.Thanking you for many kind assistances to me personally, and wishing you all pros-perity and peace in your great labors for and among the people of God,I am,Very truly your brother,J. E. Talmage,per W. D. 
 Sept. 23rd, 1891.President Wifordlford Woodruffand Counselors;Dear Brethren: For two years the Theological class of ourhigher department has been favored with the services of Elder George Reynolds asinstructor in Book of Mormon subjects.

During the few weeks of the present academic year already elapsed, enquirieshave been numerous as to the possibility of his resuming his valuable instructions.In a conversation between myself and Brother Reynolds, he stated his willingness to continue his assistance to our Theological work, if such met the approval of the Presidency.I therefore take the liberty to respectfully ask your considerationof the matter, and should you deem it advisable to give to Elder Reynolds the timenecessary for conducting a class once or twice a week, one of the most importantbranches of our Theological work will be greatly strengthened.Trusting you will pardon my trespass on your time and attention by consid-ering the object of it, I am,Very respectfully your Brother,J. E. Talmage.

 I had an Interview ^with several Pottowatamie chiefs, who came to su [us]^ between Joseph Smith & the Potowatamie chiefsme during my absence, and remained until the presentwritten by W WoodruffNote from W Woodruffs JournalSevaral of the potawatamie Chiefs came to Nauvoo for the purpose ofHaving an interview with the Prophet Joseph Smith, at the time of their arival Hehad gone to Dixon upon a visit, was kidnaped, while there and efforts made torun him to Missouri "The Indians Chiefs ^who^ remain at Nauvoo untill theprophet returned & had his trial during their stay thay had a conv talk withHiram Smith in the basement of the Nauvoo House. W Woodruff & some otherswere presant. they were not free to talk & did not wish to communicatetheir feelings untill they could see the great ^Prophet^ propheit. At length onthe 2nd day of July 1843 President Joseph Smith ^& councollars & some of the 12^ met those Chiefsin the chamber of his store ^Court room^ with about 20 of the Elders the following is asynopsis of the conversation which took place as given by the interpeter whoaccompanid them. The Indian Orator arose & asked the prophet if those ^the^ menwho ware present were all his Friends. Answer yes. He then said "we as apeople have long been distressed and oppressd we have been driven from our landsmany times we have been wasted away by wars untill there is ^are^ but few of us left thewhite man has hated us & shed our blood untill it has appeared as though their wouldsoon be no Indian Left. we have talked with the great spirit & the great spirit hastalked with us we have asked the great Spirit to save us & Let us live and the greatspirit has told us that he had raised us up a great Prophet aChief & Friend unto uswho woudld do us great good & tell us what to do and the great spirit has told usthat you are the man (Pointing to the Prophet Joseph) we have now come a great ways to seeyou & to hear your words & to have you tell us what to do, Our Horses have become poor traveling & we arehungry, we will now wait & hear your word," the spirit of God rested upon the Lamanits esspecallythe Orator who spoke Joseph was much eaffected & shed tears. He arose & said unto them "I have heardyour words they are true, the great spirit has told you the truth, I am your friend & Brother & Iwish to do you good your Fathers was ^were^ once a great people they worshipd the great spirit the Greatspirit done ^did^ them good He was their friend but they left the great spirit & would not hear his words or

 616 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12DESERET NEWS:WEEKLYTRUTH AND LIBERTYPRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THEDESERET NEWS COMPANYCHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.WEDNESDAY, - Oct 12, 1887.AN EPISTLETo the Members of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.—INTRODUCTORY.Dear Brothers and Sisters:It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighthSemi-annual Conference of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,that an epistle should be addressed tothe members of the Church, in con-formity with the custom which hasbeen observed at the past five GeneralConferences.DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.As some of the Apostles are pre-vented, by circumstances well knownto the Saints, from appearing in pub-lic, the Church will naturally look forsome expression from them concern-ing their feelings and hopes respectingthe work of our God. Especially at thepresent time is deep interest felt in theutterances of the Apostles, because ofthe loss which the Church has sus-tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHNTAYLOR. Twice before has the Churchmourned the death of its President,and each time the event has produceda profound impression upon its mem-bers. In this instance this sad eventis invested with more significance thanit would have been had it occurred inthe ordinary way. President Taylordied in exile. For about two yearsand a half he had been compelled tolive in seclusion, and to refrain fromall public association with the peoplewhom he loved more than he did life.Through his decease the Church iscalled the third time to mourn the de-parture of the man who has stood asits President and as the Prophet, Seerand Revelator to this generation. Theexperience which the Saints havegained in passing through these trialshas been of exceeding value to them.They have learned that God can takecare of his own work, and that theyneed not worry nor yield to anxiety ordoubt concerning its management.After the martyrdom of the ProphetJoseph there were pretenders who as-serted that they had the right to takehis place at the head of the Church.Some were deceived by their preten-sions, not being familiar with the or-der of the Priesthood.THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEAPOSTLES.For some time before his death theProphet Joseph was inspired of theLord to anticipate his own departurefrom earthly scenes. This was shownin various ways; but especially in thegreat anxiety which he displayed tobestow upon the Twelve Apostles allthe keys and authority of the HolyPriesthood which he had received. Hedeclared in private and in public thatthey were equipped and fully qualified,and that he had rolled the kingdom ofGod on to the shoulders of the TwelveApostles.PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONALTESTIMONY.I, Wilford Woodruff, being the lastman living in the flesh who was pres-ent upon that occasion feel it a duty Iowe to the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, to the House ofIsrael, and to the whole world to bearthis is my last testimony to all nations,that in the winter of 1843-4, JosephSmith, the Prophet of God, called theTwelve Apostles together in the Cityof Nauvoo, and spent many days withus in giving us our endowments, andteaching us those glorious principleswhich God had revealed to him. Andupon one occasion he stood upon hisfeet in our midst for nearly threehours declaring unto us the great andlast dispensation which God had setHis hand to perform upon the earth inthese last days. The room was filledas if with consuming fire; the Prophetwas clothed upon with much of thepower of God, and his face shone andwas transparently clear, and he closedthat speech, never-to-be-forgotten intime or in eternity, with the followinglanguage:"Brethren, I have had great sorrowof heart for fear that I might be takenfrom the earth with the keys of theKingdom of God upon me, withoutsealing them upon the heads of othermen. God has sealed upon my headall the keys of the Kingdom of Godnecessary for organizing and build-ing up of the Church, Zion, andKingdom of God upon the earth, andto prepare the Saints for the comingof the Son of Man. Now, brethren, Ithank God I have lived to see the daythat I have been enabled to give youyour endowments, and I have nowsealed upon your heads all the powersof the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest-hoods and Apostleship, with all thekeys and powers thereof, which Godhas sealed upon me; and I know roll offall the labor, burden and care of thisChurch and Kingdom of God uponyour shoulders, and I now commandyou in the name of the Lord JesusChrist to round up your shoulders,and bear off this Church and Kingdom ofGod before heaven and earth, and be-fore God, angels and men; and if youdon't do it you will be damned."And the same spirit that filled theroom at that time burns in my bosomwhile I record this testimony, and theProphet of God appointed no one elsebut the Twelve Apostles to stand atthe head of the Church and direct itsaffairs.THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.When the Prophet Joseph hadpassed away by foul assassination,those who possessed the Spirit of Godand were living in close communionwith it, knew the voice of the trueshepherd and were not deceived by theclaims of men who pretended to haveauthority. The body of the Churchfollowed the leadership of those whomGod had chosen, and whom His ser-vant Joseph had been instructed toprepare for this great responsibility.The Twelve Apostles, with PresidentBrigham Young as their head, becamethe presiding council of the Church.The lessons which the Church thenlearned in regard to the Priesthood,and the rights of the Priesthood, havenever been forgotten. When Presi-dent Young was taken from us, therewas no jar nor division of sentimentamong the Apostles; and among thepeople there was scarcely a question asto where the right of Presidency rest-ed. President John Taylor took theposition which belonged to him, andthe work of God moved forward with-out interruption, and with a union andharmony on the part of all connectedwith it, most delightful to wit-ness. He has stood at our headfor nearly ten years, and during thatperiod he has possessed the gifts andqualifications which belonged to hishigh office and calling. His entirecareer is one that can be contemplatedwith the utmost satisfaction and pleas-ure by all who love the truth and ad-mire integrity in those who are calledto be servants of God. From the timethat he was baptized a member of theChurch until his spirit took its flightfrom earth, he never wavered in his ad-vocacy and defense of the principles ofrighteousness. Under all the variedcircumstances through which he andthe people of God were called to pass,in the midst of the deepest trials andafflictions, his voice was always raisedin tones of encouragement and hope;and when the storms were the fiercest,he rose to the occasion and alwaysdisplayed undaunted courage and un-flinching devotion to the Zion of God.In the providence of God it fell to hislot to be with the Prophet Joseph andPatriarch Hyrum when they weremartyred for the truth, and he mingledhis own blood with theirs. Thoughseverely wounded on that occasion,he miraculously escaped death. Hewas a man whom the Lord loved.The evidence of this is to be found inthe fact that He [c]hose him to presideover His Church at the departure ofHis servant Brigham. We feel thank-ful to God our Eternal Father that wehave been permitted to live with andenjoy the society of President JohnTaylor and his fellow-laborers.Our assocation with him and thePresidents and Apostles who havegone before him into the spirit world,we esteem as a great honor. We takedelight in anticipating the rejoicingthat we shall have when we shall bepermitted to mingle in their society.Once more, the responsibility ofpresiding over the Church has fallenupon the Council of the TwelveApostles. The Counselors of Presi-dent Taylor, Brothers George Q.Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, beingmembers of the Council of the TwelveApostles at the time they were chosento be members of the First Presidency,have, since his death, taken their placesagain as members of that Council.Fifty-seven years and a half haveelapsed since the Church was organ-ized. In looking around among thosewith whom we associate to-day, howfew there are left of those who, underthe Lord, helped to lay . thefoundation of this work and were thecompanions of the Prophet in theearly labors connected therewith.To-day there is but one Apostle leftof those who belonged to the Councilof the Apostles during the lifetime ofthe Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at thetime these valleys were first settled.The other faithful Apostles who wereordained under the direction of theProphet Joseph have all passed behindthe veil. Since the death of PresidentYoung four have joined him in theother world, and in the same periodsix have been ordained as membersof the Council of the Twelve Apostles.This gives some idea of the changeswhich are occurring, and how rapidlya new generation is taking an activepart in the building up of Zion.THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.Those of us who have been at libertyto travel, have devoted our time tovisiting the various Stakes, and inmeeting with them at their QuarterlyConferences. Some of us have beenlaboring in Mexico, others in Arizona,besides visiting the Stakes in Idahoand in Utah. These Quarterly Con-ferences are attended with excellentresults. The people come togetherand receive instructions and coun-sel upon leading topics, andmuch good is derived therefrom.Though it involves considerable laborfor the Apostles to visit them, yet weare encouraged in doing so by the ad-vantages which those visits bring tothe people in keeping them informedconcerning general movements andcounsel. In these labors we have hadmuch joy and satisfaction, especiallyin witnessing the increase of faithful-ness on the part of the Saints.THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.Though many of the leading menhave been compelled to be absent,some of them having been incarcer-ated in prison, the people have, never-theless, been steadfast, and havesought with increased dilligence to per-form their duties. The persecution towhich they have been subjected hasled the people to think and act forthemselves, and not to depend somuch upon others for guidance. Thiscan not fail to be attended with goodresults. It is necessary that all themembers of the Church should exer-cise their powers of reason and reflec-tion and thoroughly understand whythey take the course which God pointsout. Intelligent obedience on the partof His Saints is desired by our Fatherin heaven. He has given us our agencyto think and act for ourselves,on our own volition, to obtain atestimony for ourselves from Himconcerning the truth of the principleswhich He teaches, and then be firmand unshaken in the performance ofall which is necessary for salvation.We have felt great satisfaction inwitnessing the dignity and couragewhich the Saints have exhibitedthrough the trials of the past threeyears. Their conduct has been ad-mirable. They have displayed greatqualities. The forbearance, patienceand fortitude which they have ex-hibited are proofs that God has beenwith them. Outrages which wouldhave goaded any other people into actsof violence have been of frequent oc-currence. In other communities menand women would be desperate undersuch treatment. But the Lord hasgiven His people power to controlthemselves and peace has been main-tained. Riots and bloodshed havebeen avoided, and even under strongprovocation, when blood was shed, thecommunity restrained itself. Preju-dice may prevent our nation and itsrulers from acknowledging at thepresent, how noble the demeanor ofthe people has been underthese trying circumstances, andwith the strong provocationswhich they have had to indulge inoutbreaks; yet the time will comewhen all this will receive its properrecognition and due credit will be ac-corded to the Latter-day Saints to theirmagnanimity and self-control through-out this entire persecution.PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.In the organizations which havebeen established among our people inall our settlements in these moun-tains, the advancement and trainingand benefit of all classes are amplyprovided for. Among no people ofwhom we know anything have suchprovisions been made for the salvationand care of the members of society ofall ages as among the Latter-daySaints. If we and our children do notprogress in intelligence and in theknowledge of all principles pertainingto life here and life hereafter, it is be-cause we do not avail ourselves ofthose facilities which are placed withinour reach. We have the Primary As-sociations provided for the benefit ofthe young children of our Church, andtheir instruction in those simple prin-ciples which they can understand. Wealso have Sunday schools for thetraining and education of those oflarger growth. In them they can learnthe doctrines of salvation and the his-tory of the work of God, and be pre-pared for greater progress. Then wehave the Young Mens' and YoungLadies' Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations, which have been organized, astheir names imply, for the developmentof the young people of both sexes andtheir advancement in every thing thatwill qualify them for lives of useful-ness and honor. But besides these or-ganizations we have the various coun-cils of the Priesthood, to some officein which every young man who isworthy can be ordained. The youngwomen, as they increase in years, canalso find a sphere of usefulness in theRelief Societies which have been or-ganized for the purposes of assistingthe Bishops and Counselors andTeachers of the Wards in caring forthe poor and relieving the wants of thesuffering and distressed. So that bymeans of these organizations, whichare of vast interest to us as a people,every one from early childhood to ma-turity, can be led forward step by step,from one degree of knowledge to an-other until fully qualified to dischargeall the duties of perfevted and honor-able manhood and womanhood.So far as we know the sisters whohave charge of the Primary Associa-tion are doing a most commendablework in arousing interest in the lit-tle ones and in teaching themin simple style those lessonswhich are adapted to their under-standings. We hope that in all oursettlements these associations will re-ceive the constant care and attentionof our wise and judicious sisters. Theseed sown in the hearts of the childrenby the instructions imparted therewill produce in years to come anabundant harvest that will gladden thehearts of the Saints who witness it.OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.The progress of the Sunday Schoolcause in Zion continues satisfactory,though undoubtedly somewhat re-tarded by the enforced absence fromits labors and associations of so manybrethren and sisters who have informer years taken an active interestin its welfare. We notice, with pleas-ure, the constantly increasing numberof schools, teachers and scholars re-ported by the officers of the Union andthe evident care taken by the presidinglocal authorities in our settlements tohave a Sunday School as one of thefirst institutions established. Weare also gratified to learn thatin most of the foreign missionsof the Church Sunday Schoolsand Improvement Associationsare being organized whereverpracticable. In Great Britain, in Con-tinental Europe, in New Zealand, andin the Sandwich Islands, as also in thebranches scattered throughout themissions in the United States, theseinstitutions are found contributingtheir influence in instructing andforming the character of the childrenof the Latter-day Saints.The Mutual Improvement Societiesare also accomplishing great goodthroughout our settlements. In connec-tion with them and the Sunday Schools,we desire to remind our brethren andsisters who are engaged in the praise-worthy labor of fostering these insti-tutions, that the original design inorganizing Sunday Schools and Im-provement Societies among us was,that the children and youth of theSaints should be made wise in theprinciples of the Gospel and their faithbe developed in the revelations ofGod. This the officers and teachersshould keep constantly in mind. Thebooks used should be almost without exception,the reveleations of God ascontained in ancient and modern Scripture,together with the other worksof the Church. The teachings,while direct, brief and simple, shouldbe such as will increase the faith, de-velop the veneration and love, anddraw out the intelligence of the youth-ful bearers toward the divine princi-ples of which by God's grace, we havebeen made the custodians. All at-tempts, however slight, to secularizethese institutions and to change themso that they will not accomplish theends sought for in their creation,should be discountenanced. Thespirit and teachings of the Gospelshould hold undivided control in allour ministrations connected with thiscause. In the theological and otherclasses all discussions should beavoided as much as possible on sub-jects which God in His wisdom has notyet fully revealed. We know there aremany persons who appear to take moredelight in dwelling upon questionswhich are mysterious and cannot verywell, in our present stae of knowl-edge, be answered than they do uponthose subjects which are plain andsimple and essential to present pro-gress. But the Lord has revealedso much that we can understandand that we ought to learn in order tobe useful in the labors devolving uponus here, that we need not enter intodiscussions on subjects which [in] noway affect our happi[n]ess here or eter-nal salvation hereafter. In our theo-logical classes, quorum meetings andothe assemblies, therefore, these de-batable questions need not be dis-cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy thetime of the members, to the exclusionof more profitable topics. In thePrimary Associations, the Sundayschools and the Mutual ImprovementAssociations, singing should receive alarge share of attention. Singing ex-ercises can be made a great attractionand also a valuable addition to the ed-ucation of the young. The interestthat is now taken among us in vocaland instrumental music is a markedfeature of the times, and this tastefinds increasing opportunities for itsdevelopment in the facilities which arenow being furnished to all who desireits cultivation. Instead of having aselect few act as choirs in theseinstitutions to do the singing for thewhole, the voices of all shouldbe united in harmonious melodyin giving utterance to the feelings oftheir hearts in hymns and songs. Thiswill increase the pleasure of the meet-ings, and make all feel that they havean equal interest in worship and re-joicing.THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.The mission of the Relief Societiesas organized among us, is truly grandand beneficent. There is no limit totheir labors and usefulness while suf-fering and want exist in our midst. Toaid the needy by feeding the hungryand clothing the destitute is distinc-tively and peculiarly their mission. Inthe energetic performance of theirduty human sympathy and divinemercy are beautifully harmonized. Inextending relief to the poor, the loveof God and of our fellows is clearlymanifest. It is more praiseworthy fora relief society to be able to say"There are none in our Ward in needof food, raiment or shelter," than toreport thousands of dollars in hand,while the needs of the poor are un-supplied.These societies have done a vastamount of good among us, and themembers have been of greate service inassisting the Priesthood in the wardsin caring for the destitute and in sup-plying the wants of those who havebeen in need of help. In these laborswe desire to give them every encour-agement and to invoke the blessing ofheaven upon them, and all their exer-tions for the benefit of suffering hu-manity.THE CARE OF THE POOR.As the winter season is approaching,it is proper that each Bishop and hisCounselors should take the necessarysteps to properly care for the poorwho live in their wards. They shouldcall the Relief Societies to their aid inthis labor. The reasonable wants ofthe poor should be supplied and thepangs of poverty and destitationshould be averted. God has greatlyblessed us in the fruits of our fieldsand gardens, in our flocks and herds,and in giving us comfortable habita-tions and means to sustain ourselves,and we should always remember thewords of the Apostle James: "Purereligion and undefiled before God andthe Father is this, to visit the father-less and widows in their affliction, andto keep himself unspotted from theworld."While it has always been thepolicy of our people to encourage in-dustry and to repress idleness to everyform, and to expect all persons tocontribute, according to their ability,to their own support; still there aremany cases where the aged and the in-firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, withthe utmost exertion and economy, ob-tain through their own labors suffi-cient to sustain themselves. It wouldbe a great evil among us to encourageany class in living upon the benevo-lence of the community. No systemof begging should be permitted.Those able to work should be fur-nished employment. Persons who areproperly disposed will be glad to ob-tain it in preference to being fed withthe bread of charity; and all shouldbe encouraged to labor according totheir strength. This policy, if wiselypursued will prevent pauperism, de-velop self exertion and confidence, andproduce self-respect. It is a causeof great pleasure to think that beg-gary is unknown throughout our set-tlements. There is no need for any-one, however destitute, to publiclysolicit alms. But while this is thecase, the sensitive and those whoshrink from asking aid, who concealin some instances, their poverty,should be carefully looked after by theRelief Societies under the direction ofthe Bishops of the wards, so that theremay be no individual in any of ourwards suffering for the want of food orany other article necessary to sustainor preserve life. The community whosehearts are open to the cries of distress,who are ready to administer of thesubstance which the Lord gives themto relieve their fellow creatures, mayalways depend upon the favor of theLord, for he loves those who are kindto their fellow-men, and who admin-ister to their necessities, whose heartsare tender, and who readily respond toapplications of this character whichare made upon them, or who antici-pate them by giving freely to the desti-tute.FAST OFFERINGS.In some of our wards there is notproper care taken in the collection ofthe fast offerings of the people. Thefirst Thursday in the month has beenset apart in the Church as a day offasting and prayer. That day shouldbe strictly observed. Fast offeringsshould be brought with a liberal handto the Bishop of each ward, that hemay be prepared to supply those whoare dependent upon the ward for su-stenance. Some wards require consid-erable aid from the Church to helpsustain their poor, because their ownfast offerings do not supply them;while sometimes in the same Stakethere are other wards where there arefew, if any, dependent poor. Presidentsof Stakes should make arrangementswith the Bishops of the last namedwards to transfer their fast offeringsto the Bishop of some contiguousward which has more poor within itsborders than its own fast offeringswill supply. In this way all the peo-ple can have an equal opportunity ofdoing their duty to the poor.THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.Experience has abundantly provedthat those who are attentive to thoseand all other duties required by theLord receieve His blessing. God doesbless those who devote themselveswith singleness of purpose to Hiswork. If proof of this were needed,one has only to notice the condition ofElders in the various settlements whohave spent years of their lives uponmissions. Though their home affairsmay have been left to the care of theirwives and children, they are not dis-tinguished by their poverty from theirfellow-servants who have remained athome.We have only to look around us tosatisfy ourselves also, that those whoare generous in contributing to God'swork are favored of the Lord. Thiswas the experience of ancient Israel,and it is our experience. Yet in re-gard to voluntary donations there istoo much carelessness, not withstand-ing all the precious promises con-nected therewith. The Saints shouldbe reminded of the obligation whichrests upon them. Our children, also,should be taught this duty, that it maybecome a fixed habit with them topunctually attend to these matters.Those who have strictly observedthese requirements can testify to thegreat pleasure and many rewards theyhave received from their observance.This law of liberality appears to beone of the safeguards which the Lordhas adopted to avert from his peoplethe evil consequences which followthe possession of wealth. He has toldus that the riches of the earth are Histo give; but He has warned us to be-ware of pride, lest we become as theNephites of old. We know the ruin itwrought for them, and we shouldspare no precaution to prevent wealthhaving a disastrous effect upon us.Many can endure poverty and be hum-ble and live near the Lord who cannotbear riches. They become lifted up to 
 Oct. 12 THE DESERT NEWS 617pride and become covetous, and for-get their God. Those, however, whoremember constantly the teachings ofthe Lord concerning the earth and itsinhabitants, and who contribute of themeans which the Lord [ink splot] [g]ives them toassist the poor and help carry forwardthe work of God, exercise a check uponthemselves and give Satan less powerto lead them astray. Under the pres-ent system of affairs, those who ac-cumulate wealth and are able to sup-ply themselves and their families withluxuries and advantages that are de-nied their neighbors, are in danger ofbecoming separated from the bulk ofthe people and forming a distinctclass. But the day will come when amore perfect order will be introduced.Then it will be said there are no poorand no rich in Zion—that is, we shallnot be divided into classes, but shallall possess everything of this charac-ter necessary for our comfort and hap-piness. But until then, if we wish ourfamilies and ourselves to remain Lat-ter-day Saints, we must be especiallycareful to guard against the deceitful-ness of riches.THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.The great labor which devolves uponus, as members of the Church, is tobuild up Zion. God has founded Zion,and we should seek to extend its bene-fits and blessings until all mankind. Itshould be our constant care to donothing that will weaken its influenceor power or retard its growth in theearth. This we should constantly im-press also, upon our children, thatthey may grow up filled with an abid-ing love for the work of God.There has been too much neglecton this point. Many have pursued ashort-sighted, selfish policy; and haveworked to that which they believedwas their own individual advantagewithout regard to the effect their ac-tion would have upon the work of God.Their eyes have not been single to Hisglory. Such a disposition has proveda snare to those who have indulged init; they have wrought injury to them-selves, not to mention the effect theirconduct has had upon Zion.THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.The Lord has informed us that mar-riage is ordained of God unto man.The instutition of marriage, in somecommunities of which we read, is fall-ing almost into disrepute. It is al-leged that there is a growing tendencyin this direction among us. The causeis doubtless, traceable to the in-crease of wealth and the dis-inclination of young men to takeupon them the burdens of a wife andfamily. As we depart from the sim-plicity of early days, we may naturallyexpect that this tendency will increaseas young men may be restrained fromoffering marriage to young ladies un-less they can give them something likeas comfortable a home as they enjoyunder their parents' roof. Extrava-gant or luxuriant habits or training onthe part of the girls will also have theeffect to deter young men from marry-ing. Care should be taken by everyperson of influence to conteract thistendency, and to set before the risinggeneration the advantages which fol-low well-arranged marriages. Nocommunity can prosper and maintaina high standard of morality wherethere is a large percentage of unmar-ried young men and young women.We should deplore the increase ofsuch a class among us, and all honor-able means should be used to preventits existence. The young of bothsexes should be taught that it is notnecessary to happiness in marriageto be in the possession of wealth. Inthis country an industrious, economi-cal married couple can soon surroundthemselves with all the conveniencesand comforts essential to life and hap-piness. The satisfaction each willhave in after years in the enjoymentof the fruits of their joint industry andthrift will amply repay them for any in-conveniences or privations they mayhave been subjected to in the earlydays of their married life. The com-forts thus accumulated will be doublysweeted unto them by the recollec-tion of their exertions in common toprocure them. No rightly constitutedand educated young woman will refusean offer of marriage from a worthy, in-dustrious young man for no other rea-son than that he is not able to surroundher at first with the comforts whichshe may think she ought to have.Young men who have a due share ofthe qualities which women esteem ina husband need not be afraid that girlsof that kind will refuse them, becausethey may not be well endowed withthis world's goods. They will cheer-fully bear their part of the burdens oflife without repining when confident ofthe love and supporting and guidinghand of their husbands.AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.We feel led to caution the Latter-day Saints against forming the badhabit of incurring debt and takingupon themselves obligations which fre-quently burden them heavier than theycan bear, and lead to the loss of theirhomes and other possessions. We knowit is the fashion of the age to use creditto the utmost limit, and it is custom-ary for nations, states, counties andcities to borrow money, issue bondsand thus load themselves with taxesto such an extent that large numbersof the people are prevented from own-ing land or even the houses which theyoccupy. Thus the masses become ten-tants and have to pay rent for land andshelter. This is a great evil and onethat we, as a people and as individuals,should carefully shun. Our businessshould be done, as much as possible,on the principle of paying for thatwhich we purchase, and our needsshould be brought within the limit ofour resources. The disposition tospeculate and to take chances uponventures of one kind and anothershould be repressed. There are manypeople who have been rendered home-less in our Territory by the neglect ofthis precaution. To raise funds to in-vest in some scheme which has ap-peared promising they have mortgagedtheir homes, only too often, to be dis-appointed and to find themselves with-out a place of shelter for themselvesand their families. All this is wrong.If the penalty for such unwisdom fellupon the one who through those acts andinfluence it is brought about the con-sequences would not be so deplorable;but very frequently families sufferand the bad results are widelyfelt. We, therefore, repeat ourcounsel to the Latter-day Saints,to shun debt. Be content with mod-erate gains, and be not misled by illu-sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re-member the saying of the wise man:"But he that hasteth to get richshall not be innocent." Let our chil-dren also be taught habits of economy,and not to indulge in tastes whichthey cannot gratify without running indebt.ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.We have been favored, as no otherpeople have, with wise counsels.Their extent and variety are immeas-urable. They cover every departmentof human life. So far as we have ob-served them, prosperity and happinesshave been the results. Whateverdifficulties we may have to contendwith to-day are due, if not wholly, atleast in great part, to our disregard ofthem. Is not this the experience andtestimony of all the faithful Saintswho have watched the progress ofevents among us? Had we observedthese counsels, how many of the evilsfrom which we now suffer wouldnever have been known among us.Our neglect of them has brought itspunishment, and the faithful can seeit. But shall we not profit by the ex-perience of the past and act more wise-ly in the future? As the Lord has said(Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 90, ver.36[–]37)."But verily I say unto you, that I, theLord, will contend with Zion, and pleadwith her strong ones, and chasten her untilshe overcomes and is clean before me: Forshe shall not be removed out of her place,I, the Lord, have spoken it."We should begin to understand thatGod's ways are infinitely superior toour ways, and that His counsels,though they may seem to call forsacrifice, are always the best and thesafest for us to adopt and carry out.Thousands among us can testify to thetruth of this from individual experi-ence. These thousands should com-bine and create a public opinion in fa-vor of obedience to the counsel ofheaven that will have its proper effectupon our children and the inexperi-enced among us.THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.We also should learn this greattruth, that God will have all the gloryand honor for the establishment ofHis Church and Kingdom on theearth. Man cannot claim it in this orany other age of the world. Nothingbut the power of God could havebrought forth the fullness of the Gos-pel, organized the Church, gatheredHis people to Zion in fulfillment ofrevelation and performed the workwhich has been accomplished. There-fore, as Latter-day Saints, we areobliged to acknowledge the hand ofGod in all the blessings we enjoy.THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.It should be the aim of all the mem-bers of the Church to carry out prac-tically in their lives the principles ofthe Gospel. In no way can we betterconvince the world of their truth thanin showing in our acts and dealingswith one another and withmankind the elevating effect theyhave upon us. We make high profes-sions, and there should be such a highstandard of purity of life among us asto correspond with these professions.Our children should be impressed withthis, and be taught that the name ofSaint is so holy that they only whoare pure in heart can claim it.If our religion does not lead us tolove our God and our fellow man andto deal justly and uprightly with allmen, then our profession of it is vain.The Apostle says:"If a man say, I love God, and hateth hisbrother, he is a liar: for he that loveth nothis brother, whom he hath seen, how can helove God whom he hath not seen?"We can best exemplify our love forour God by living our religion. It isvain to profess a love for God whilespeaking evil of or doing wrong to Hischildren. The sacred covenants wehave made with Him strictly imposeupon us the duties we owe to oneanother; and the great office of religionis to teach us how to perform thoseduties so as to produce the greatesthappiness for ourselves and for ourfellow-beings. When the obligationsof our religion are observed, no wordsare spoken or acts are committed thatwould injure a neighbor. If the Lat-ter-day Saints lived as they should do,and as their religion teachesthem to do, there would beno feeling in any breast butthat of brotherly and sisterly affectionand love. Backbiting and evil-speak-ing would have no existence amongus; but peace and love and good willwould reign in all our hearts and hab-itations and settlements. We wouldbe the happiest people on the face ofthe earth, and the blessing, and peaceof Heaven would rest upon us andupon all that belongs to us.If there be unhappiness and heart-burnings and quarrelings and hatredsamong us, they exist because we donot observe the religion which we pro-fess. They are not its fruits. Wherethese evils exist there is a crying ne-cessity for repentance. If any feel in-jured by the words or acts of theirbrethren or sisters, the Gospel pointsout and furnishes the way by whichthis injury may be repaired. Insteadof talking about this to others theyshould go to the person or personswho have done the wrong and maketheir feelings known. If satisfactionis then made, that ought to end thematter; but if not, it can be reportedto the proper officers of the Church forthem to take the necessary steps toterminate the difficulties. In this wayanimosities and disunion can be pre-vented and confidence be maintained.PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen-eral custom to partake of thesacrament once a week. Ifthe teachings of our Lord,in remembrance of whom we observethis sacred ordinance, be regarded, noone who has trespassed can be per-mitted to share in it until he has madereconciliation. It is the express com-mandment of the Lord Jesus that noone shall be permitted to partake ofHis flesh and blood unworthily. Amore perfect system to prevent theexistence of improper feelings andwrongs, among brethren and sisterscan not be imagined. If the Saints dotheir duty, difficulties do not remainunsettled beyond the Lord's day whenthey assemble to eat and drink in re-membrance of Him.TEMPLE WORK.Notwithstanding the difficulties thatthe Saints have had to contend with oflate, they have pursued their labors inevery direction with unabated zeal.This is particularly noticable in theirattendance at the Temples. The wishto avail themselves of the opportuni-ties for attending to the ordinances forthemselves and their deceased friendshas, if anything, increased, and thoseemployed in these sacred buildingshave their time fully occupied in per-forming their duties there. It is evi-dent that the Latter-day Saints ap-preciate the blessings to be obtainedthrough this Temple work. When wereflect that we have two buildings ofthis character already completed,furnishing abundant facilities forall who choose to go there toobtain the ordinances of God'shouse for themselves and forthose in whose salvation they takeso deep an interest, and that we haveanother Temple at Manti nearing com-pletion, and one in Salt Lake City,which we hope to see finished beforelong, our hearts are filled with glad-ness and we cannot refrain from prais-ing our God for His goodness unto Hispeople in permitting them, notwith-standing the oppositions and many dif-ficulties they have had to contendwith, to erect such structures and todedicate them, according to the pat-tern He has given for these sacreduses.No right feeling Latter-day Saintcan think upon this subject withoutbeing thrilled with heavenly joy forwhat God has done for us in our gener-ation, furnishing us, as He has done,with every facility to prepare us, ourposterity and our ancestors for thateternal world which lies beyond thepresent life. The Latter-day Saintsare, in truth, a highly favored people,and praise to God should ascend fromevery heart and habitation in our landfor the great mercy and goodnesswhich He has shown unto us. He hasmade us promises of the most preciouscharacter, and he has fulfilled them upto the present time. We would be themost ungrateful and unworthy peoplethat ever lived if, after receiving suchwonderful manifestations of His good-ness, we slackened in our diligence ornailed in our obedience and devotionto Him and His great cause.FOREIGN MISSIONS.The treatment which the Elders havereceived in preaching the Gospelthroughout the Southern States, aswe are informed by President JohnMorgan, has been much better of latethan it has been at some other periods.The Elders are listened to with morepatience and do not meet with so muchof the spirit of mobocracy and un-reasoning hate. Additions are beingmade to the Church, and those whoemigrate from that region have gener-ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo-rado.The Elders in the North WesternStates under the direction of PresidentW. M. Palmer, pursue their laborswith undiminished zeal and with mod-erate success in bringing people intothe Church. These fields of laborhave furnished opportunities for num-bers of our young men to gain experi-ence in missionary efforts, and thosewho have this privilege return home,in the most of instances, better quali-fied to assist the local authoritieswhere they reside in the labors of theministry.In Great Britain the Elders meetwith considerable opposition in places,principally, however, from apostates.They find that field a much more dif-ficult one than it was in former years.The hearts of the people seem to havebecome hardened, and great indiffer-ence prevails in regard to religion.Still we learn from President GeorgeTeasdale, who presides at the presenttime over the European Mission, thatthe Elders who zealously enter intothe labors of the ministry and abund-ant cause for rejoicing in the successwhich attends their exertions.Throughout the Swiss and GermanMission presided over by Elder Fred-erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina-vian Mission presided over by Elder N.C. Flygare, the Elders are laboringalso with commendable zeal and withgratifying results. An effort is beingmade at the present time to preach theGospel in Turkey, where Elders JacobSpori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintzehave been, and are laboring, and eventhe land of Palestine has been visited,and in the late company of emigrantswhich reached this City from Europe,nine persons were gathered who hadreceived the Gospel in thatland, a land hallowed tous as the earthly home ofour Redeemer, and the soil of whichhis sacred feet trod.On the Sandwich Islands the Eldersare laboring faithfully under the direc-tion of President William King, andeverything is being done to improvethe condition of that people and tosave them from the destruction whichthreatens the extinction of the race.The plantation at Lale is still main-tained, and the Elders who have la-bored and who are still laboring thereenter with spirit into the managementof that property in a way to benefit asmuch as possible the native Saints.The attention of the Elders there is di-rected at present to the NavigatorIslands, where some few years agotwo native Elders from the SandwichIslands were successful in baptizing alarge number of natives and organizingthem into branches. These Islandshave not been visited by any of thewhite Elders, but it is probably thatsome of our Elders on the SandwichIslands may in the near future make avisit there.The letters which we receivefrom New Zealand where Presi-dent William Paxman presides,continue to bring us gratifying intelli-gence concerning the condition andprogress of the work there. TheElders are very successful among theMaories. Many of the white brethrenhave succeeded in acquiring the lan-guage of that race, which is cognate tothat of the Sandwich Islands, and two ofthem, Elders Ezra T. Richards andSondra Sanders, Jr. are now en-gaged, we are informed, in translatingthe Book of Mormon into the Maorilanguage. In Australia the Elders arealso laboring, but it is a much harderfield than among the natives of NewZealand.HOME MANUFACTURES.Frequent reference has been made inpast teachings and in former Epistlesto the subject of home manufactures.It has been, and we feel it still oughtto be, a theme of inexhaustible inter-est to Zion; yet there remains an im-mense amount to be done in develop-ing our resources and furnishing facil-ities for the employment of the people.It is pleasing to note the progresswhich is being made in some direc-tions. Our woolen manufactures aregaining credit for their excellence inother communities as well as our own.But we export considerable wool evenafter all our factories are well sup-plied. If this could be manufacturedat home, it would add greatly to thewealth of our community, not only inthe profits which would accrue from theuse of machinery, but in the employ-ment which it would furnish to manyof our citizens. Besides the manufac-ture of woolen clothes, there is con-siderable home-made hosiery of excel-lent quality which is placed on themarket.The range of articles which aremanufactured in this Territory isgradually increasing; and from thefeeling which now prevails we judgethat many more branches will soon beadded to those already in operation.The manufacture of soaps of variousgrades has now become a settled andpaying business. A fine quality of hatsis also made. Boots and shoes andclothing, glass, white lead, leadpipe, native paints, brushes,paper, printing type, starch,pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu-factured in the Territory, and many o[f]these articles in sufficient quantitiesto supply the local demand and to ex-port to some extent. It is an encour-aging feature in the most of these en-terprises that those engaged in themare seeking to enlarge their facilitieswith the view to increase their produc-tion. We have a large number ofchildren growing up among us whoshould be furnished with opportuni-ties to acquire skill to mechanism,manufactures, and other pursuitswhich are necessary for the comfortof man. It is not only incumbent uponparents to seek for avenues of prof-itable employment for their children,but it should be kept in view by theleading men of the Church in all oursettlements. An idle man's brain, itis said, is the devil's workshop, andno community can propser and main-tain a high standard of morality thatdoes not furnish employment for itsmembers. Far better to work for lowwages than not to work at all. Butwith proper care, and by putting inuse the experience that many individ-uals in every settlement possess, thereneed be no want of remunerative em-ployment for the rising generation,and for others who may come in fromabroad. It may not always be keptin mind, yet it is a fact, that any per-centage of idle persons in a commu-nity is a direct loss to the whole.It is unfortunate, also, for acommunity, when the youngand enterprising are compelledto leave it and go elsewhere to findemployment or room for the exerciseof the talent of which they feel them-selves possessed. Settlements thatare in this situation will languish andgo to decay, while others that furnishfacilities for employment will becomethrifty and prosperous. The combi-nation of capital by means of co-op-eration would, in many instances, en-able settlements to start branches ofmanufacture and conduct them suc-cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how-ever, should not be encouraged, astheir failure destroys confidence andmakes it more difficult to obtain aidfor worthy enterprises which might bemade successful. Where co-opera-tion has failed among us, it has notbeen because the principle is defect-ive, but because of mismanagement,sometimes from ignorance and care-lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, fromselfishness.Our country abounds in useful ele-ments. We have a fertile soil, whenproperly cultivated, and an admirableclimate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta-bles, as well as all kinds of stock, canbe raised here, and as superior inquality as can be found anywhere onthe earth. Care should be taken toraise the very best varieties. Ourhorses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, aswell as our grains, and fruits, andvegetables, should be of the verybest kinds, and no pains should bespared to keep them pure. Our sys-tem of irrigation does not admitof the cultivation of large areas ofland. Our farms are moderate in ex-tent. This being the case, they shouldbe cultivated in the most approvedstyle, and the whole business con-nected in a manner to bring the bestresults. As facilities for educationincrease, there undoubtedly will be amarked improvement in the manage-ment of all these branches of busi-ness.PRACTICAL EDUCATION.It is gratifying to notice the interestthat is being taken among us in educa-tion; yet there is great room for im-provement. As the taste for what maybe called book-learning increases,manual labor should not be neglected.The education of the mind and theeducation of the body should go handin hand. A skillful brain should bejoined with a skillful hand. Manuallabor should be dignified among usand always be made honorable. Thetendency, which is too common inthese days, for young men to get asmattering of education and thenthink themselves unsuited formechanical or other laborious pur-suits is one that should not be allowedto grow among us. Of course it isnecessary as society is now organized,that the professions, as they aretermed, should receive attention. Butevery one should make it a matter ofpride to be a producer, and not aconsumer alone. Our children shouldbe taught to sustain themselves bytheir own industry and skill, and notonly to do this, but to help sustainothers, and that to do this by honesttoil is one of the most honorablemeans which God has furnished to hischildren here on the earth. The sub-ject of the proper education of theyouth of Zion is one of the greatestimportance.President Brigham Young during hislifetime established schools in Provoand Logan, where the principles of theGospel have been taught in connectionwith the other branches of education, andmore recently similar schools havebeen commenced, and conducted withmarked success; in Salt Lake, Beaverand Fillmore Cities.The good results arising from teach-ings received in the Provo and LoganAcademies are very apparent andpleasing to all who have the interestsof the young at heart, and we regretthat such institutions are so limited innumber.Through the indefatigable labors ofProfessors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew-art and their associates, these schoolshave done, and are now doing, a greatwork in educational advancement, byinstilling a knowledge of the princi-ples of the Gospel of life and salva-tion into the minds of our children,upon whose shoulders the Kingdom ofGod must rest in the near future.We trust it will not be long beforeschools of this kind will be establishedin every city and village where theLatter-day Saints reside. In themeantime, however, the Saints shouldnot fail to avail themselves of theprivileges that are now offered them inthe Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore,and Salt Lake Academies.THE "CHURCH SUITS."Congress at its last session as youare aware, passed a law entitled "AnAct to amend an Act entitled an Act toamend Section 5352 of the RevisedStatues of the United States, in refer-ence to bigamy, and for other pur-poses," etc.Under the 15th and 17th sections ofthis law the Perpetual EmigratingFund Company and the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arerespectively declared dissolved, andin this Act it is made the duty of theAttorney General of the United Statesto cause proceedings to be taken in theSupreme Court of the Territory ofUtah to wind up the affairs of said as-sociations.Pursuant to the duty thus imposedupon the Attorney General, on the 30thday of July, 1887, proceedings were be-gun in said court by the United Statesagainst the Perpetual Emigrating FundCompany and its trustees, and theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints and its alleged trustees for the(Continued on Page 624.) 
 624 THE(Continued from page 617.)purpose of disposing of the property ofthe one and winding up the affairs of theother: asking in these suits to escheatto the United States large amountsof property alleged to be held by thesetwo defendants. At the time of thiswriting nothing has been done in thesecases further than to appear and an-swer these complaints. What the resultof these cases will be, we, of coursecannot now say. It is proper, how-ever, that we should speak upon thisimportant proceeding and let theSaints know how the cases stand.The Perpetual Emigrating FundCompany, as all of you well know,was conceived and organized for butone purpose, namely, to aid the poor ofour people in their humble efforts togather with their brethren. It hasbeen for this charitable purpose, theobject of the generous bounty of theLatter-day Saints, but at no time inits history has it owned any real es-tate, or any personal property, savesufficient for its absolute needs eachsucceeding year. The Church on theother hand has been the owner ofproperty, the gifts and bequests of anearnest, sincere people, made for thepurpose of aiding in the propacationof the Gospel of our SaviorJesus Christ. The effort now beingmade by our government to dissolveor wind up these associations andescheat their property, is the first ofthe kind in that history of our people,and is believed to be without histori-cal precedent in this country. Whenwe say we shall watch these cases withdeep interest, the Saints will readilybelieve that it is not alone for theproperty involved in these suits, butalso for the principles and rights thatare at stake.OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.The intelligence which reaches usfrom our settlements in Arizona is en-couraging; and we note with pleasurethat the people of the settlements atSt. Johns and Woodruff have conqueredsome of the difficulties with whichthey had to content, and which madetheir position very trying. Indeed,the news from all the Stakes there isgratifying.IN IDAHO.In Idaho, though our people paytaxes and support the schools, every-one of our faith is denied the privilegeof acting in the capacity of a schooltrustee or teacher, and no one withour belief can take the test oath thathas been prescribed by the Legislature.The situation of the people there isone that excites great sympathy. Theyare practically denied the rights ofAmerican citizens through the infa-mous test oath law which was enactedby the Legislature. It is very tryingto their patience and bears heavily up-on them. But the day must comewhen they will be relieved from theoperation of this infamous law.IN COLORADO.In San Luis Valley, Colorado, theefforts of our people to open and cul-tivate farms, and to surround them-selves with the necessaries and com-forts of life, are meeting with gratify-ing success. This is the more note-worthy because of the fact that thegreat bulk of settlers there havenot had experience in battling withthe difficulties that have to be met inthe building up of new settlements inan untried soil and climate. Like theSaints in Wyoming, those who residein Colorado have always received fairtreatment and encouragement andkind consideration from their neigh-bors and the officials of the State.IN MEXICO.Our settlements in Mexico are pro-gressing favorably and are graduallybeing strengthened, both at Diaz andJuarez. At the places named and inthe Sierra Madre Mountains near thelatter, we have nearly one hundredand fifty thousand acres [al[l grazing, timberand agricultural lands.The country is well adapted to stock-raising, as the grasses are of goodquality and great variety, while theclimate is uniform, the temperatureseldom reaching higher than 85 degreesor lower than an approach to thefreezing point. The facilities formaking comfortable homes there areexcellent, the land, water and timberbeing good. A fine steam saw, shingleand lath mill, and a planer andmoulder, are in operation, affordingbuilding material within easy reach ofJuarez.The treatment of our people by thenational and state officials in Mexicoand her citizens generally, has beencordial and hospitable. By word andact they have encouraged colonizationin the Republic. The settlements inChihuahua afford abundance of roomfor several hundred families and theycould live there in peace, and by ordin-ary habits of industry would soon makethemselves prosperous and happy.The Mexican Mission was opened in1870, and the Church now has quite alarge following of native Saints, mainlylocated in and about the national cap-ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice ofWarning, and numerous pamphletshave been published in the Spanishlanguage and are being distributed ac-cording to ancient predictions. Thusthe truth is being spread abroad amongthe seed of Israel through the meansof the record of their fathers, as wellas by the preaching of the Elders.THE ALBERTA COLONY.Recent letters from President CharlesO. Card, in charge of our colony inCanada, contain information of a grati-fying nature. The soil upon whichthey are located is said to be very pro-ductive, and the grain and vegetablesproduced are of excellent quality, andrange for stock is abundant and nutri-tious. The colony is preparing forwinter, and the families composing itwill soon have their houses completed.They have opened a fine vein of coalwithin three miles of their settlement,which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.The treatment accorded the Saintsthere, by officials and people, has beenconsiderate and kind, and the pros-pects for improvements and propserityare good. Brother Card would be gladto have any of the Saints, contemplat-ing a change of location, to join him,in that land, and we will gladly ap-prove efforts in that direction.CONCLUSION.We cannot refrain from expressingto you our own feelings of thankful-ness that we live in such an age, andthat God has bestowed upon us HisHoly Priesthood and has permitted usto take part in His great work. Weare thankful that we are associatedwith this people called Latter-daySaints; that we live in a day whenProphets and Apostles have been raisedup in the Church of Christ; and thatGod has stretched forth His hand tofulfil[l] His great and marvelous pur-poses which have been predicted bythe mouths of the holy prophets sincethe world began. We testify in thename of our Lord and Master, Jesus,that this is the great work of whichthe prophets have spoken, that God isthe founder of it, and that it will standforever, and accomplish all that hasbeen predicted concerning it. Zion isestablished and will be redeemed. Andit is our continual desire unto God thatHis people may be faithful in keepingHis commandments and doing Hiswill, so that they may be accountedworthy to stand, and their childrenafter them, and inherit the great bless-ings which He has to bestow uponthe faithful. The day is not far dis-tant when our Lord and Savior will berevealed from the heavens, and weshould live in a constant expectation ofthis great event, and seek, with all theenergy and power that we can exerciseand obtain, to prepare ourselves, ourhouseholds, and, as far as we have in-fluence, the inhabitants of the earth,for His glorious appealing.Your Brother,WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of theTwelve Apostles.[line]FROM SATURDAY'S DAILY, OCTOBER 8.[line]Snow.A conference visitor in from Wyom-ing reports that it has snowed steadilyfor three days at Evanston and west ofthere to Weber Canon, winter havingthus unquestionably introduced itselfin that region for the season.

 Prest Woodruff addressed the Conference uponthe importance of the Latter Day Dispensation thegreatest that ever has ^been^ or ever will be committed toman on earth. 
 1 Prest Woodruff said that the Prophet Isaiahhad faithfully described the travels of this peoplefrom Jackson County and Nauvoo acrossthe Plains to these valleys and our settlements. Zion must spread abroad the Saints willagain take possession of their own and upon every site that has been dedicated for thatpurpose a temple will be built by the Latter day [Saint??] 
 Prest W Woodruff said if the Saintspaid their tithing punctually there would be noneed to call for means to build temples as therewould be an abundance for that purpose.The word of Wisdom is not obeyed as generally asit ought to be. Co Operation is a principletaught the saints as it is for their blessing. Thesesmall towns should not have more than one Co-Op Store. Don't pull apart and put up otherstores.

 Prest Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conferenceon the necesity of living near to God and enjoying theSpirit of Revelations. Warned against taking advantageof one another. There are several temples in course oferection among the Latter Day Saints and he prophesiedthat they should be completed. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff said we should beenergetic in getting as many names as possibleof our progenitors. 
 Prest W Woodruff said that the saints atKirtland built their Temple in their poverty. Geo.A. Smith hauled the first load of rock that hasbeen used in this generation for Temple f buildingRelated his early experience as a missionarySaid he spoke so much about temple building because he saw the necessity of this work. He had already had the ordinance of Baptism performed fortwo thousand of his family.
