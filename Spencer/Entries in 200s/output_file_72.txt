 I can easily glean some facts out of somelexicon or encyclopedia, but the history relatedtherein usually relates facts, without givingthe reasons, how this and that has happened.Just these however are the thing, we aim toget the knowledge of. So f. e. [for example] it is told in onethat you were driven out of Missouri on HC.of deprecations committed by your people, becauseyou had robbed property, cattle, etc. I even knowa novelF going as far as ascribing to you therobbing of women for immoral purposes. Nowthat all this is nonsense is sure, nevertheless itis written again and again, though meremeditation might teach anyone that evennow and much less at these times any^no^thingcould be robbed from a farmer except perhapsa cow or a horse, and of these your peoplehad plenty as the same writer says your peoplewere in well off circumstance. The balancestip much more to the contrary, that the igno-rant populace got incited to rob your stores etcand that their religious ire was incensed bythe avarice and not at all by any divine orany other reason.But I fear I took already too muchof your time.

 but consider myself as belonging to you in thespirit, without being officially in your body.Now, dear Sirs, I beg to approach youwith the following request. Leaving all religousquestions aside your prophet Josef Smithtried in his way to solve the social problemsof his time and as far as the little knowledgegoes, which I could gather about these facts,(very little known here) I reckon he has solvedit about it in the best manner possible forhis time and your church has done the best itcould to keep in his tracks. That you couldnotkeep out of the encroachments of capitalismis something inevitable and your history of thelast 20 years at least was less one of religiousstrive [strife], but of the agressments of outsiders tryingto destroy your institutions more than yourreligion, which in the main would leave themcold.To get fully acquainted with all thesematters referring to the social institutionsof your church from its earliest time hasnow been my chief desire since long time, andI beg to address myself to you, asking you tokindly furnish my with the necessary details.I am asked to hold a lecture about yourhistory etc. next fall. Now you may be sure

 REVELATION AND JUDGMENT.Remarks at the Weber Stake Confer-ence, Ogden, Sunday, July15, 1894, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Reported by Arthur Winter.]I feel very refreshed to get away from home once in a while and mingle with the people, and listen to the teachings, revelations and prophecies of the pro-phets, apostles, seers and revelators among the Latter-day Saints. I am glad to meet with the Saints today in Ogden.I have a good many things upon my mind that I do not expect I shall ex-press here this afternoon; but a few things I want to say.The subject of revelation is frequently referred to. We occupy a position be-fore God, angels and men, and at least one world, that is very interesting and important. God never gave to man a dispensation of more importance than the one you and I live in; and to sup-pose that this Zion of God, this great work of preparing the way for the final triumph of the Son of God and the estab-lishment of His throne and kingdom on earth could pass through a generation without revelation is one of the most mysterious things on the face of the earth. God never had a people or a Church in any age of the world that was not governed by men who held the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdom of God, and those men were obliged to have revelation. We have the records containing some of their revelations before us.With regard to this dispensation I want to give you some of my views. In the first place, the dispensation was pointed out and proclaimed through the mouth of almost every prophet that has ever dwelt in the flesh. These prophets pointed to this Zion, to this work, to this gathering together, and to the warning of the world by prophets, apostles and elders, called of God to go out and proclaim the Gospel and warn the nations, that they might be left without excuse in the days of God's visitation of judgment upon the world.There is no Elder who has gone out to preach and who has baptized anybody but knows that he has had to have revelation to enable him to magnify his calling. He could not live withoutthis and do his duty. In the commence-ment of this work the Lord raised up a man to be a prophet, seer and revelator.  Joseph Smith was kept in the spirit world for thousands of years to be born in the flesh at the right time, and to be inspired of God, to be visited by Him, and to be qualified and prepared for the mission given into his hands. How long did Joseph Smith live in the flesh after he organized this Church? A little over fourteen years. What did he do during that time? He organized the Church of God, upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the chief corner stone. He also gave unto us a code of revelations. No more sublime revelations were ever given by God to man. Read the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and all the books on earth, and then read these revelations, and you will see the Spirit of God, not only in him, but in the dispensation in which these revelations were given. He gave us a foundation to work upon, and rev-elations to guide us and carry us into the celestial kingdom. The question may be asked, How is it with regard to those that followed him? Where are the revelations of President Young?  Do you find them on record? Only a few; but the Holy Ghost and the revela-tions of God were with Brigham Young from the day that he received this Gospel until the day that he laid down his life and his tabernacle was carried to the grave. There was no necessity particularly for Brigham Young to give written revelation, only in a few instan-ces. So with John Taylor. So with Wilford Woodruff. And so in a great measure probably with all who may follow us, until the coming of the Sonof man. But are we without revelation?  We are not. We know our duty, and in a measure we know what lies before us. Some of the people have had the idea that the Presidency of this Church and the Twelve Apostles should have nothing to do with temporal matters.  Well, we would be in a bad fix if we did not deal in temporal matters. Joseph Smith stood at the head of this dispensa-tion all the days he dwelt in the flesh. So did Brigham Young. I traveled with Brig-ham Young at home and abroad, and I never saw a day in my life but what hehad the spirit and power of revelation of God with him. This power was with himwhen he came to this land. It was with him when he laid the foundations of our temples, and when he laid out the city of Salt Lake. He did all these things by the inspiration and Spirit of Almighty God.The Lord requires a great deal of this people. The Elders of Israel were called from the various occupations of life to go and preach the Gospel. They preached to you in your native lands.  They told you, in the name of the Lord,if you would receive the Gospel, repent of your sins, and be baptized for the remission of them, you should receive the Holy Ghost. Did you not receive it? Yes, you did, or else you have no business here. You would not be here if you had not been inspired by the Spirit of God. These are truths, and you know them for yourselves. The fruits of the Gospel have been manifest from the beginning of this Church, and will be until the scene is wound up.I saw a curious thing here today as I came to meeting. I saw a military camp at the depot. It brought a flood of re-flection to my mind. I traveled with Joseph Smith, sixty years ago this sum-mer, one thousand miles, to Jackson County, Missouri, our brethren having been driven by a military body from their homes. We went up there and accomplished all we were sent to do.We have had military gatherings in this land for the last sixty years. We hadquite a military display in Jackson County. We had a military gatheringin Clay County. We had a military gathering in Ray County, and in Cald-well County. What were all these mili-tary gatherings for? Was their objectto protect the railroads of the nation? Not at all. What was their purpose? It was to drive the Latter-day Saints, to destroy them, to take their property,and root them out of the earth if they had the power; and except for the power of God they would have accom-plished it. I was singularly struck inlooking at this military body. Whatare they here for? Are they here to drive the "Mormons" out of Ogden? It does not look like it. I think it is toprotect the property of these railroads. What does all this mean? Does it notmean that there is a change of affairs inthe earth? What are the signs of thetimes? Do the Latter-day Saints com-prehend them? This is a fast age. TheLord is going to cut His work short in righteousness. Read these revelations,for they contain the history of what is going to pass in the earth. The Lordsaid to Joseph in the beginning of this Church:"Behold, verily I say unto you, the angelsare crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields;But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not upthe tares while the blade is yet tender, (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy thewheat also.Therefore let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe, then yeshall first gather out the wheat from among thetares, and after the gathering of the wheat, be-hold and lo! the tares are bound in bundles,and the field remaineth to be burned."What is the matter with the world today? What has created this change that we see coming over the world?  Why these terrible earthquakes, torna-does, and judgments? What is the mean-ing of all these mighty events that aretaking place? The meaning is, these angels that have been held for many

 years in the temple of our God have got their liberty to go out and commencetheir mission and their work in the earth, and they are here today in theearth.  I feel bold in saying this to theLatter-day Saints.  There is a meaningin these judgments.  The word of theLord cannot fall unfulfilled.  If youwant to know what is coming to pass, read the revelations of St. John, readthe Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and thesethings are at our door.  What is thematter with this nation?  Thousands of men striking, mobs rising up and des-troying property, and tribulation pre-vailing!  I want to say that you will allfind before you are many years older that Utah is a prettygood place to live in.So far as our temporal matters are concerned, we have got to go to workand provide for ourselves.  The day will come when, as we have been told,we shall all see the necessity of makingour own shoes and clothing and raisingour own food, and uniting together tocarry out the purposes of the Lord. We will be preserved in the mountainsof Israel in the day of God's judgment. I therefore say to you, my brethren andsisters, prepare for that which is tocome.  You have a great future before you.  There is a change coming overthe world with regard to Zion.  Theday is coming when the world will say,"Let us not go up to battle against Zion,for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible;wherefore we cannot stand."  They willfind that the power of God is with thispeople.  We want to prepare ourselvesfor this, and sanctify ourselves beforethe Lord that we may be prepared to carry out our mission.Revelation is with us, and it is withyou.  Let us be united and do our duty.Search the scriptures, for they testify ofthese things.  I pray God that Hisblessings may be over us, that our eyesmay be opened to see, our ears to hear, and our hearts to understand the things of the kingdom of God, that we may beprepared to work with those upon theother side of the veil; for these greatevents that are rolling upon the earth will come to pass, and no power on earth can stay them.  They are declared by the revelations of God and must befulfilled.  God bless us all and lead usinto all truth, for Jesus' sake.  Amen.

Partic-ularly am I desirous of securing that of President Woodruff. Howvaluable his testionmony would be in years to come, is apparentwhen we consider that the testimony of the Prophet Joesph and those of the other Presidents of the Church who have passedaway, would give us untold pleasure, if we could hear them now. They would be priceless, and the benefit to be derived fromhearing their testimonies of the truth, by those who never sawthese great men, would be beyond ^present^ conception. I have some excellent machoines, and would like the privilege of an interviewwith you, when I would bring one and you could speak into it.I would supply one copy of each record for the Hoistorian's Office, for preservation, and only ask the privilege of keeping others like them for my own use.

 Rockville Jan 4, 1896Presidents Woodruff Cannon and Smith.Dear BrethrenI have had it in mind for some time to enter a home-stead. As this is a step which would com-promise me for 5 years at least, and as I feel itmight involve a loss, or prevent me from doingsomething else my maker might desire me to do, I thought it prudent to seek counsel before doing so.The land I had thought to enter as ahomestead is situated in the N. W. corner of KaneCounty about 30 miles ^East^ of Cedar city; is in thehigh mts on the headwaters of the Rio Virgen River.It may be irrelevant to give you the locality of the land; as the two points onwhich I have doubts as to whether it would be right, and causes me to doubt the wisdomof my intentions are:1st Would it be right to isolate myself and partof my family, at least half my time for 5 yearsfrom any organized ward where I could attendmeetings or assist as a help to the Priesthood?2 Would my assistance be wanted in the next5 years in the missionary field or elsewherewherein I would be handicapped by homesteading?I would greatly appreciate a few words of counsel sometime during the winter if not too great anintrusion on your valuable time.

 The MasculineElementHas Gone FromSt. John's in the South Seas,and Thousands ofWomen Clamor for Husbands.Husbands are wanted on the St. John's group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.Captain Bergman of the American shipBonanza says that bashful young menafraid to pop the question need not gothrough the world without a mate if they will only go to these little coral islands in the Southern seas.The Captain's ship was becalmed a fewmonths ago close to the main island of thegroup and for nearly a whole day she layscarcely moving a foot.

 [Clarence J. Elliott Nov 23 96contaminated by the beachcomber and the insolent trader whose shiftless presence onislands in direct communication with civi-lization has done so much toward influenc-ing the South-sea natives toward lives ofcrime and debauchery.The natives are of the Papuan race, andup to a few years ago several traders whotried to barter some of their gaudy calicosand gew-gaws for the products of the islandfurnished inviting repasts for the chiefsand head men of the islands. Several timessuch expeditions were repeated and everytime the natives enjoyed a banquet, and atlast all attempts at trade were given up.The natives are of the same race as thosewho inhabited the Solomon group. Evenfiercer were they than the Bushmen, whoa few weeks ago slaughtered Baron vonNorbeck and several of the crew of theAustrian training ship Albatross on Gua-dalcaner island.These women sighing for husbands, theCaptain said, are ruled by a queen known as Plea Waar. At one time she led thewomen of her island in the many battlesthey had with the inhabitants of the otheratolls of the group, but when their sorrowscame they learned that war was not all thatmade them happy. Their fondness for ban-quets at which the men of their race wereentertained brought all their present woesand peace among all the four islands of thegroup was declared. At that time onlya few hundred men remained and the wo-men outnumbered them almost ten to one.When that state of affairs existed the trad-ers gained a small foothold on the islands.The women were easily pleased with thebright trinkets offered to them and the fewmen left dared not say them nay when theydesired to make a purchase. The men meek-ly fell into the ways of the women and thequeen was the boss of the Government. Herchief had lost his rule. With this stateof affairs in the island a strange craft drop-ped anchor off the reefs and in the week that followed all the able-bodied men inthe group were induced to take passageon the vessel for some plantations in SouthAmerica.When the black-birder sailed away therewere left yearly two thousand women onthe island, and only a hundred old men.Husbands they wanted, but none were tobe had. That state of affairs had existednearly a year when the Bonanza drifted close to the island, and the Captain and hiscrew had a narrow escape from being kid-naped into matrimony.Captain Bergman says the dusky belles,as far as he could ascertain, have overcometheir fondness for human banquets, and heassures any young men looking for an easy,indolent life that he can do no better thanaccept the offer of the queen of the St. John'sgroup. He can have as many wives as he desires and a home that will be suppliedwith all the luxuries of a tropical isle, andhe won't have to even ask for it if he oncesets foot in the dusky queen's domain."The women are by no means unattractivein appearance," said the Captain, "althoughthey are ignorant of the many aids to beautythat are known in fashionable life. Theyare of simple habits and indulge in none ofthe luxuries that have prevented many menfrom entering into the matrimonial state."Their dry-goods bill, for instance, would be inconsequential in the budget of house-hold expenses, for they practice an economyin dress that is simply astonishing. Theircostumes are beautiful in their simplicityand set off their charms in a bewitchingmanner. Nor because they are of a canni-balistic race should it be supposed that theyare devoid of that true affection whichshould mark the partner of one's bosom.True enough, it might at times be somewhatunpleasant to contemplate at dinner a shin-bone or two and wonder whether they werethe remains of a lately deceased mutton oronce carried some other fellow. Yet, sur-rounded by all the comforts of a home in the dreamiest of South-sea islands, whereall nature teaches one to love, a man whocasts his lot upon any of the islands of St.John and allows himself to be carried intowedlock, might easily imagine himself su-premely happy."When we anchored off the main islandthe Bonanza was besieged with the duskycharmers, all willing to be wed. Some cameoff in canoes and others swam from the shore, but whether they arrived on deck,glistening with the nut oil, which is theirgreatest beautifier, or dripping with brine,all came with the same mission."Husbands they demanded as a right.They had nothing to say about the suffragequestion, nor did they discuss the tem-perance problem. Not even the most world-ly wise wished to exact a promise that herchosen one would stay home o'nights andnot run around to the other islands, talkingpolitics. They promised not to gossip andto be obedient in all things if only someone would marry them right away."I had a hard time preventing that armyof women from carrying off my entire crew.They only way I could escape was to promiseto return with a shipload of gay young beaux who would permit themselves to beloved, petted, and fed on cocoanuts andyams until the end of their days."Plea Waar, the warlike Queen of the forsaken Papuans, is a very remarkablewoman. Tall, muscular and of a command-in presence, she would attract attentionanywhere. As she is the absolute monarchof all she surveys, including the surround-ing reefs and atolls that are unsurveyed,she would be a great prize for the luckyman who might win her dusky heart andnot bloodless hand. Since the disappearanceof all the men on the islands her nature hasbecome greatly softened, and she now plues, as do her maidens, for the presence of thedear departed."It was whispered that she had made a ragout out of one or two of her husbandswho had not lived up to her expectationsbut no white man need fear any such fate.The St. John's natives acknowledge a lik-ing now and then for a bit of native flesh,done brown, but white man's meat, they say,has such a salty flavor that it is unpalatable."One charming characteristic of thesewomen is the absence among them of jeal-ousy. A man may have as many wives as he wants and be happy with any when theother dear charmers are away. It wouldbe a great place for Mormon missionaries.They might take down there a hundred or two of the young scions of Zion and estab-lish a branch kingdom in the South seas.The possibilities of such a scheme are be-yond computation. The Queen would ac-cept the Mormons with open arms."St. John's group never having been verypopular with traders, the women are likethe trees and fruit of their island home ---nature's own creations. Like the Samoansand Gilbert islanders, they have well-round-ed forms and are of the temperament that isfostered by the warm sun of the tropics."In my opinion, it would really be a pay-ing proposition for a company of benevolentChristians to charter a vessel and send toSt. John's a consignment of the unemploy-ed to become husbands for the lonely womenof the sea-girt isles. For every husbanddelivered the Queen would be willing toexchange a ton of cocoanuts or anythingelse that might be preferred. There is inthis proposition a magnificent opportunityto make a fortune that should not be over-looked."The sailors of the Bonanza are quite asenthusiastic as their Captain over the lone-ly and loving women of the manless Eden of the South Pacific."Say," said one of them, "I never seesuch a sight, and I've sailed in all the waterson the globe. Why, they just swarmedover the lee rail like a lot of monkeys. Andmebbe they ain't hummers! Why, I hopeto never go to sea again if I ever seebefore so much female loveliness all to-gether at one time. They are mostly wo-men of middle stature, but what they lackin height they make up in development.Why, between you and me, if I could havedone it on the quiet, I would have just ma-rooned myself down there on that islandand taken a couple of years off to enjoy life."There was one of 'em who was a stun-ner, and no mistake. She was just asbright as a dollar, and had big, watery eyesthat were just full of love. She was takenwith me, I could see that, and I hated tounclasp her arms from my neck and tellher I was an orphan and couldn't marry without my Captain's consent."All they want is mates. That's all.And they ain't proud, neither. If theycan't get mates, why, they'll be satisfiedwith a bos'on, or even a plain ordinaryseaman like me. Between you and me, Ithink they would even take the cook ora landlubber."I never saw such a lot of love-sickmaidens in all my born days, and I'm nochicken, either. The Captain had to keepan eye to windward, or else he would havelost every man jack of us, I'm thinkin'. It'spretty hard, I tell yer, to have to tell a lov-ing maiden that you can't marry her --- andshe with sections of islands to throw intothe bargain; but we had to do it. Theskipper wouldn't take no nonsense."But, say, between me and you, myselfand some of the boys are a-goin' backthere some day and, if you believe youruncle, if we don't have miles of cocoanuts,and be mighty big chiefs ourselves, whythen I'll swallow my kit, that's all."This story is reminiscent of a portion ofthat unsurpassed tale of Hermann Melville,a greater Clark Russell whose sea stories offorty years ago are still read with great in-terest by all acquainted with the Englishtongue. Mr. Melville's description of howthe vessel on which he was aboard was be-sieged by the amazons of a South-sea isleis so nearly analagous to the experience of

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.Apostle that has lived upon the earthhas prophecied of this great day and dispensation. I have lived in this Church nearly fifty years, and havewatched its organization and growthfrom nearly the first, and have known frown the first, and know to-day, that Joseph Smith was raised up and sus-tained by the Lord to do the work of opening up this dispensation. Every-one who expects to obtain part orparcel in this kingdom without trials,will be greatly mistaken. The growthof this Church has been very similarto the parable of the mustard seed, inevery one of its stages. The speaker desired to impress one thing upon his hearers---viz, if this was not theChurch and Kingdom of God, theworld would not hate you---the worldloved its own; but if the people love righteousness the world will hatethem. Jesus and his disciples werenot popular among the Jews; theythought he had come to take theirplace and nation. The speaker couldremember for some sixty-seven years,and looking back on the history ofthat time, he could see a great change in the feeling of the people concerningreligious matters. In his youngerdays he sat for hours hearing thePresbyterian ministers picture thetorments of hell, where the flamesrose higher and higher and higher,with a fervor that would scare a greatmany from committing sin, but thegreat ministers have knocked the bottom out of hell, and it will hold nobody now. Some of these mini-sters and others who are fighting against this work will find there is a hell, and that it will hold them. The learned men of to-day also say theybelieve there is no God. Congress-men, law-makers, statesmen and otherslaugh at you when you describe thehand of God in the events of the day. The Latter-day Saints believe in a God, know there is a God, and intendto follow the instructions revealedthrough his servants. A Congress-man said to one of my brethren lately:"If that bill passes, God have mercy on you Mormons!" I say, if themen in power will persecute us, Godhave mercy on them and their fami-lies. Shall we fear and tremble be-cause the world oppose us? I say no, and I say yea and amen to the valiant men who express the sentiment that we cannot yield one principle. I haveno commandment to yield, no stepsto retrace, no principle to forswear toplease any man or men, and do notbelieve that God will ever ask any ofus to do so, for the Church must bekept intact, and those who cannotfeel the conviction that I do, will doso before ten years are past. Wehave a future, a high destiny, and that God who has raised up a king-dom on the earth is not asleep. He may allow trials to test his people, butwe must not sell our Gospel or anyof its principles, and if any are weak-kneed they are not wanted in thisChurch. I have seen the banks of the Mississippi lined with thousands of men, women and children in themud and in the rain, driven there bya Governor, but it will all come outright. I have never broken any lawof the land, that I know of, that hasbeen constitutional. The principlesof the Constitution were given to ourforefathers by inspiration, but theirgrandsons are discarding it, and rend-ing it, and if this course is not stoppedthe whole of the props of liberty will be lost. I want to say to our ene-mies or friends that it costs a greatdeal to shed the blood of God's peo-ple. The Jews crucified Jesus, andsince then thousands, and perhapsmillions of Jews have been crucifiedor died unnatural deaths. Therewere two men killed in Carthagejail, and the country has had to pay abig price in blood for that murder,and the bill is not all paid yet. Anumber of Congressmen expresslystated in the legislative halls at Wash-ington that they could not vote forthe bill which has been passed re-cently, because it was so glaringly un-consitutional, and all the Congress-men know it is unconstitutional. Thiswarfare is not between Congress andthe handful of people in these moun-tains; it is a warfare between God and man, and God will fight our battles. We have a court to appealto above the courts of this land, and the whole of the hundred thousandSaints should seek their private cham-bers and petition that court and itsJudge for justice.

 DISCOURSEBY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF, DELIVERED In the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday Afternoon, June12th, 1881.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.The Object of Assembling together—The Sa-crament—All people should have the privi-lege of worshipping God according to the dictates sf their own conscience—Why this fnrore [furor] against the "Mormons"—Mr. Coy-ner's statement before a Missionary Societyin Rochester—Delivery of the Gospel to Joseph Smith—Book of Mormon and the Bible contain the same Gospel—It required an angel from heaven to reetore the Gospel—The first principles—Order of the Church—Judgments—What the blood of the Mes-siah has cost the Jews—The gospel givento the Gentlies—Apostacy of the Gentiles—Polygamy—Calling of the Latter-daySaints—This the Most Important of allDispensations—Increase of Wickedness— Exhortation to be Faithful.WE have assembled ourselves as Latter-day Saints for the purpose of worshipping God, of listening to in-structions, and administering one of the ordinances of the house of God—the sacrament. I look upon the sa-crament as an ordinance of great im-portance to us; in fact, from the days of Adam down to the days of Jesus Christ there were sacrificesoffered; not only by Adam but by his posterity, by Moses and the house of Israel, and all the generations of peo-ple who were led by the Lord—sa-crifices were offered as a type of thegreat sacrifice to be made by theMessiah. They offered the blood of bulls, rams and doves as a type ofthe great and last sacrifice and death of the Messiah, whose blood was shed for the redemption of theworld. Prior to the death of theSavior, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was administered to His dis-ciples, and they informed that they were to partake of the bread as an emblem of the broken body ofthe Lord, and of the wine—or what-ever is made use of as a substitute—in token of the shed blood of theLord Jesus Christ.I feel disposed here to make a re-mark and say, that if I were the emperor of the world andhad control of every human being that breathes the breath of life on earth I would give to every man,woman and child the right to wor-ship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and whenI say this I speak the sentiments ofJoseph Smith, Brigham Young, thePresidency of this Church, theTwelve Apostles, and all the Eldersof Israel. This is the sentiment of all the Latter-day Saints. What!would you grant the Methodiststhis privilege? Certainly. And the Baptists? Yes, certainly. And the Catholics, the Shakers, the Quakers? Yes, and everybody else under heaven. I would grant to all people the right to enjoy their religionwithout molestation. I would even extend this privelege to the Latter-day Saints; I would give them theprivilege of believing in the Bibleand the organization of the Churchaccording to the ancient pattern, with Apostles and Prophets, ChristJesus being the chief corner stone. Why would you do this? I woulddo it because God himself does it. The God of heaven grants to all his children, every sect and party ofwhatever name and denomination under the whole heavens, theiragency and the right to worshipGod according to the dictates of theirown conscience. The Lord forcesno man to heaven. He places beforehim life and death, light and dark-ness, truth and error, and havingbefore him all these principles he is at liberty to worship God and believe what he chooses. He alone is re-sponsible to God for his actions.Now, when I read the history of theworld in days that are past, when I note the illiberal spirit that was manifested and the blood that hasbeen shed upon the earth—for theearth has been deluged with bloodunder what is termed holy wars, under the garb of holy religion—I look upon it as the most ungodly and unrighteous thing that was ever committed upon the earth. I look upon what is taking place to-day in the same way. I marvel sometimeswhen I see the spirit of our nationand the feelings of the sects of to-daytoward Utah and the Latter-day Saints. Have we ever stood in thepath of any man, sect or people with regard to their religion? No, we havenot. We have been willing at alltimes that men should preach their doctrines and believe them unmo-lested by us, and I would say, to ex-press my own feelings, that if a man believed he had to climb a cottonwood tree three times a dayfor salvation I would never hinderhim. No, this liberty, this freedom, especially under the American Gov-ernment of all nations under heaven,ought to become universal. No manor set of men should attempt to hin-der their neighbors from enjoyingtheir religion. And while I say this, and while we grant all men thisright and privilege, as we have done here in this city, this Tabernacle andvarious other buildings having beenopened to the clergymen of the day, we have been perfectly willing, afterwe have heard all they have had to say, to accept any truth they might have that we are not in possession of. If thers is a man in this world who has one truth that I have notgot, I am willing to exchange all the errors I have got for that truth. Butwe as a people claim the same rightwe grant to others. We claim the right to worship God unmolested by our fellow men. The laws of God,the decrees of God, the oracles ofGod, as well as laws of our countryand the constitution of our govern-ment grant this right to the human family—yes, even to the "Mormons,"as we are called, to the Latter-day Saints as well as every other c[l]ass.Then, why this tremendous furor among the sects of the day with re-gard to these "Mormons" and theirreligion? The trouble is the world do not know anything about our re-ligion, they do not know what we believe in, and if anybody forms anidea from what they hear abroad they hear anything but the truth.I have been amused sometimes—I have of late—in reading the speech-es delivered by gentleman—clergy-men at that—who profess to have lived in Utah and to understand this people. One gentleman who pro-fesses to be acquainted here deliver-ed a speech in Rochester, before a missionary society, in which he stat-ed that "there were in Utah 620,486young persons in the Mormon dis-trict, and it was the youthful ele-ment that missionaries were work-ing on." Well, now, how does this gentleman make out 620,486 youngpeople out of 140,000? I do not know by what process of mathematics, or by what rule he arrives at this ques-tion. That gentleman knew just aswell when he made that assertion that it was false as I know. Our pop-ulation is only about 140 000. Mr. Conyer, who had lived here some six years, stated "that there were40,000 scholars in the mission, andhe wanted assistance to furnish his enlarged s[c]hool." Well, now youtake 40,000 scholars out of the total populationof 140,000, and I do not think you will leave many for the Mormons. But all this is as near true as anything you get abroad,and I really wish that gentlemen, clergymen and everybody else whoattempts to report Utah would tell the truth. That is all we ask of anypersons who visit us. But it seems impossible for anybody to speak ofUtah and the Latter-day Saints—"Mormons" as they are termed—with any degree of truth; but I wishthey would, it would be better forthem, better for us, and they wouldbe under less condemnation.Now what are the principles in which the Latter-day Saints believe? What is the dreadful crime that wehave been guilty of for the last fiftyyears? Why, the Lord has raised upa Prophet—Joseph Smith. He sentan angel from heaven in f[u]lfilmentof the revelations of St. John. [##Revelation 14:6##] And that angel delivered the gospel to Joseph Smith, delivered unto him power and knowledge to obtain the Book ofMormon, a record containing the history of the ancient inhabitants ofthis continent who dwelt here hun-dreds and thousands of years ago.  He translated it into the English language. Does the Book of Mor-mon contain a different gospel to that contained in the Bible? It doesnot. It gives a history of the peoplewho dwelt upon this continentanciently, tells where they came from and how they came here, tells of the dealings of God with them,and the establishment of the Churchof Christ among them. They were visited by Jesus after His ressurrec-tion. Hence He said "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold:them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice; and there shallbe one fold and one shepherd." [##John 10:16##] He also told the Nephites when He established His church among themthat He had other sheep. Theywere the ten tribes of Israel. The Book of Mormon is a history ofthe dealings of God with that people; the Bible is a history of the dealings of God with Judah and with the Jews and the twelve tribes of Israel: itcontains in fact a short outline of the dealings of God with the Jaradites and Nephites from the building of the Tower of Babel down to the days of the Savior and after His resurrection. The Bible is the Stick of Judah in the hands of Judah,and the Book of Mormon the Stickof Joseph in the hands of Ephraim. [##Ezekiel 37:16-20##] Both books contain the same gospel.  There was never but one gospel and there never will be any other reveal-ed to the human family. HencePaul says: "Though we, or an angelfrom heaven, preach any other gos-pel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] Now, if Joseph Smith had establish-ed any other gospel on the earththan the gospel that Paul taught,that Christ and His Apostles taught, and that was taught to Abraham, Noah and the antediluvian world, why we would have the curse of Godresting upon us. The great trouble with the so-called Christian world is that they have spiritualized the scriptures until there is not a sem-blance of the gospel left. I never could find it. I never could hear a gospel sermon in my life, and I satunder Dr. Porter and Dr. Hawes and other great divines of the day. I never could hear a gospel sermon ac-cording to the ancient pattern aswas taught by Joseph Smith. Of course all sects have had some truth. All sects have professed to believe in the blood of Jesus Christ, more or less; all sects and partieshave their various roads to heavenand to hell, but none of them teach the gospel according to the patternlaid down in the New Testament.It required an angel from heaven"to fly in the midst of heaven, hav-ing the everlasting gospel to preachunto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue and people," to prepare them for the great judgments of our God before the winding up scene. [##Revelation 14:6##] That angel has come: that gospelhas been delivered. It was deliveredto Joseph Smith. He did not re-ceive his power from man, but from the revelations of Jesus Christ. What did that gospel teach? Why, faith in Jesus Christ. "Yes, oh yes," say the Methodist, "we believein Jesus Christ." All right. Thenthe next principle was repentance of our sins. "But," say the sectarian "world, "we also believe in repent-ance." Well, what is next? The revivalists who visited this city (Messrs. Sankey & Moody) believed in Jesus Christ, and they said that if a person only came to Christ, he did not require to be a Methodist, Bap-tist, Mormon, or a[n]ything else. Pro-phets and Apostles were not requir-ed; all that was required was to come to Christ. But we say there is something more required besides be-lieving. [Every] man has to be baptized for the remission of his sins in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven. That law of baptism has never been altered. Many believe in baptism even by immersion, but not par-ticularly for remission of sins.  What next? Having repented ofour sins and been baptized for a re-mission of them, we must havehands laid upon for the reception ofthe Holy Ghost, and when we havereceived the Holy Ghost it will beunto us a principle of revelation, a testimony of the Father and of the Son.Well, what kind of a church areyou going to have? Paul, in speak-ing of the Corinthians, goes on to represent the Church of Christ to the body of a man. He shows that every part of the body must act in unison; the head, the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the feet must all worktogether in order that the body maybe perfect and that there be no schism. We are also told that God set in the Church Apostles, Pro-phets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry,for the edifying of the body of Chr[i]st. Now, we have had indepen-dence of mind enough to believe this doctrine. This is "Mormon-ism." It is faith in Christ, repen-tence of our sins, baptism for theremission of our sins, and the re-ception of the Holy Ghost by thelaying on of hands. These are the principles which we as Latter-day Saints believe in. We do not believethat God ever had a church on the earth without Apostles and Pro-phets in it, without inspiration in it.  To do away with any of the princi-ples of the gospel would cause a schism in the Church of Christ. When you cut the head off a man he will die. He may live if he loses an arm or a leg, but if you cut the head off he will die. Precisely so with the Church of Christ. We believe in the Bible; we believe inall the prophecies; we believe Godmeant just what He said and saidjust what he meant; we believe thatthe prophecies of the scriptures areof no private interpretation; we be-lieve in the second coming of Christ; we believe that the judgments of Almighty God will be poured out upon this generation. All the un-belief of the world will not stay thef[u]lfilment of the decrees of the Al-mighty. The unbelief of the in-habitants of the antedeluvian world in the days of Noah did not stay the deluge. The unbelief of the inhabitants of Sodom Gomorrah did not avert the destruction of th[e]se cities. The unbeliefof the Jews did not avertthe destruction of Jerusalem. We look for a literal fulfilment of the decrees of God. We know as apeople that He has set His hand toestablish His Church. He has setHis hand to warn all nations. TheHoly Priesthood has been restored,not by the power of man, but by the power of Almighty God.As I have said, we believe in the [B]ook of Mormon as containing a re-cord of the ancient inhabitants of this continent, and a clue to the ruins which have been discoveredin various parts of the land and for which the world can find no origin.  The whole history of these things, however, is pointed out in the Book of Mormon, and if the world wouldonly take the trouble to read that book they would understand these things perfectly. The AmericanIndians are a remnant of the an-cient inhabitants of this continent. Their forefathers were an enlight-ened people. They had the gospelamong them and the power of God was manifested in their midst; but when they became wicked and turn-ed away from God, the jugdments of the Almighty fell upon them and they were overthrown and destroy-ed by warfares. The Lamanites, now a downtrodden people, are a remnant of the house of Israel. Thecurse of God has followed them as it has done the Jews, though the Jews have not been darkened in their skin as have the Lamanites. The fate of the Jews in this respect is a standing monument to all infidel-ity. The prediction of Jesus with regard to them has been literaliy fulfilled. He predicted that they should be led away captive unto all nations, and that Jerusalem shouldbe trodden down of the Gentiles, un-til the times of the Gentiles be ful-filled. When Pilate was ready torelease Jesus because he found nofault in him, the Pharisees and High Priests, being filled with prejudice, would not have it. They cried out "Crucify him, crucify him, and let his blood be upon us and our chil-dren." [##Luke 23:21##] [##Matthew 27:25##] The prediction of Jesus hasbeen verified, and its fulfilment is before the world to-day. The Jews have been trampled under the feetof the Gentiles for 1800 years, andthey are to-day being persecuted inEuropean nations. Why? Becausethat curse of God rests upon them and will rest upon them untilShiloh comes, until they are re-gathered to Jerusalem and rebuildthe city in unbelief. You cannot convert a Jew. They will never be-lieve in Jesus Christ until He comesto them in Jerusalem, until these fleeing Jews take back their goldand silver to Jerusalem and rebuild their city and temple, and they will do this as the Lord lives. Then the gentiles will say, "Come let us go up to Jerusalem; let us go up andspoil her. The Jews have taken ourgold and silver from the nations ofthe earth—come let us go up andfight against Jerusalem." Then willthe prophecies that are before you befulfilled. The gospel was preachedfirst to the Jews and then to the gen-tiles. The Jews rejected the mes-sage: the gentiles received it, andunto them was given all the gifs and blessings of the gospel. But Paul told them to take heed lest they fellthrough the same example of unbe-lief. [##1 Corinthians 10:12##] Yet in time, we gentiles, de-parted from the kingdom of God,and the church went into the wil-derness. There has not been an or-ganization of the church of Christ on the earth from the days of the ancient Apostles, until the days ofJoseph Smith, who came forth inthis great and last dispensation, andwho by inspiration and power fromon high again restored the gospel. The world do not believe this. Wecannot help that. The unbelief of the world does not make the work of the Lord of non-effect. The Lord has set his hand to establish his church and kingdom, and the warn-ing voice is to all men. He has call-ed his servants to bear record of thisto all nations. This is what the Lord is doing with these dispised Mormons. And already the mem-bers of nearly every sect underheaven have embraced this work, though our numbers are small com-pared with the christian world. We expect this. As it was in the days of Noah and Lot, so shall it be atthe coming of the Son of Man. These principles are true. The worlddoes not know what awaits them nomore than they did in the days ofNoah, or in the days of the Jews.But, why this furore against theLatter-day Saints? Do you know?  "Oh, yes, we do. You are Poly-gamists. That is what is the mat-ter." Well, indeed! Now, let meas you a question. Were we Poly-gamists when we were driven from Jackson and Clay Counties?  Why, the worst persecution we haveever had, was before Polygamy was revealed to us, or before we received it. What cause, then, had the Mis-sourians and others to drive us in the beginning? "Oh, you believe inrevelation, you believe in prophets;we cannot bear these things, they are all done away with. These things were only givenin the dark ages of the world,but to-day, living as we are in the blaze of the glorious gospel, we donot need them; but if you will be-lieve as we do and scatter yourselvesabroad among the Methodists, etc., and do as they do, it will be all right." Now, gentlemen. it is not polygamy. What do you care aboutpolygamy? What does our nation care about polygamy? What do thesectarians care about polygamy?Bless your souls, nothing. But nine per cent. of these Mormons may be polygamists. Dreadful! Why, haveyou no evils in New York? Haveyou no evils in Boston? Have youno evils anywhere? Are you all perfect? If so, you are pretty well off; you are certainly prepared forsalvation. But no, my friends, I will tell you: If we were to give up polygamy to-day—if we were to say  to our government, "Oh, yes, wewill give up polygamy"—why the next thing they would say would be,But look here; you have got to give up something more than that." They would tell us, as the Missou-ians did, that we must quit believ-in prophets, apostles and revelation.The same feeling exists to-day as existed then.We Latter-day Saints are called out of the world. We have receivedthe gospel of Jesus Christ. The Lord Almighty  has raised up pro-phets and apostles in this our day, and has set His hand to establish the kingdom that Daniel saw in ful-filment of revelation and prophecy.  [##Daniel 2:26-47##]We have been gathered out from the nations of the earth to thesevalleys of the mountains. Zion is growing and increasing. This hasbean the ca[s]e from the beginning.There has never been an hour from the organization of this Church but what our course has been onwardand upward, Even in the midst of mud and water, on the banks of theMissouri River, where, by an edictof Governor Boggs, some 10,000 weredriven—no matter under what cir-cumstances we have been placed,the hand of God has been over us.  The Almighty has set His hand to gather in the meek of the earth. And after our testimony, will comethe testimony of thunderings and lightnings. Read the revelations of St. John; see the signs of the times, and prepare yourselves forthat which is to come. We trustin God. We cannot afford to denythe Lord, we cannot deny his reve-lations. We have a code of revela-tions called the Doctrine and Cove-nants. That code, given through the mouth of Joseph Smith, con-tains the most sublime revela-tions concerning this genera-tion that were ever given to the world. Many of these revelationshave had their fulfilment so far astime has permitted. Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. I tra-velled thousands of miles with him; in fact the revelation he gave con-cerning the war that would break out between the North and South, Iwrote that revelation myself as it was given by the Prophet 20 yearsbefore it was fulfilled. That revela-tion was published to the worldbroadcast, and I merely refer to itbecause it is a thing that is clear to the minds of all men. All the reve-lations in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, the Bible, and the Book of Mormon will have their fulfil-ment in the earth.We are living in an important day.  We are living in the most importantdispensation God ever gave to man. There is a great change awaiting us; there is a great change awaiting Zion, our Government, and the 
 Juab Stake Conference.NEPHI, Juab County, U. T.,January 21st, 1884.Apostle Wilford Woodruff addressed the congregation for the remainder ofthe time. It was very pleasing to lis-ten to the whole of the discourse. He said there is a good people living here.When he looked upon the great workit required to build up Zion he felt that we fell far short of what we ought tobe. He was not surprised that the devil is mad, or that the world areagainst us. He and his followers al-ways oppose the truth. They call upon us to give up our religion. What a strange position we should be in; weshould have the devil and all the worldfor our friends. But God and all the heavenly hosts would be against us.  We cannot do this. Our nation has a constitution, and it was made for us just as much as it was for any other religious denomination, and if they trample it under their feet they will bedestroyed. We have a right to serve God and we are going to do it.In the evening a priesthood meeting was held and largely attended. Thepresidents of the several quorumsgave very cheering reports of the faith-fulness of the brethren of this stake.Bishop William H. Warner reportedthat the deacons, mostly, had hauledabout 50 loads of wood for the poorand our meeting house, and they madeit a practice of turning out in quorumsand chopping the wood up. ApostleWilford Woodruff said during his re-marks at this meeting that this was thefirst time that he had ever heard thatthe deacon's quorums had ever magni-fied their calling. He also said that allthose who had been ordained to thePriesthood were expected to magnifytheir callings or they would be con-demned.On Sunday morning a Stake Confer-ence was held for the Sabbath Schools.

Price One PennyFUNERAL SERVICES OF APOSTLE ERASTUS SNOW.-[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 421.]-Apostle Heber J. Grant said: I ampleased to add my testimony regard-ing Brother Erastus Snow. I knowof no man who has labored morefaithfully and energetically. Nonewere too insignificant for his notice.He took an interest in all. There isno man whose life is a better examplefor the youth of Israel. My ideal ofan apostle was Erastus Snow. WhenI was called as an apostle I prayedthat the same spirit of self-sacrificemight inspire me. No man can sayanything but good of him. He hasbeen a Latter-day Saint in very deed,and has gained an exaltation in thecelestial kingdom of God. It was in-tended to read the last sermon hedelivered, at a young men's meeting,April 8, 1888, but there is not time.He then said: "The Lord keeps Hisown counsels in these things, and itis not given to us to know and under-stand the day and the hour when theSon of Man will come; but it is forus always to be prepared, and to solive that we shall be prepared for Himwhen He does come. And whetherwe lay down our bodies before thecoming of the Son of Man or not it mattereth not, so that we have filledour days with usefulness, are prepared to come forth when the trump shallsound and call forth the dead. I domost heartily endorse those senti-ments which have been expressedconcerning the dead who die in theLord. They do not taste of death.It seems to me that there is no death,but they are moving on to life—lifeeternal." Brother Erastus is movingon to life eternal, and may we followin his footsteps.I am requested to read a few wordswritten by Apostle Moses Thatcher.Erastus Snow is dead! How few,even among Latter-day Saints—howfew, indeed, of his immediate associ-ates—comprehended his worth, orfully appreciated his generous, un-selfish disposition.He was great because [he was] good. Anintellectual giant, yet humble as achild. Now, and in years to come, asquestions of magnitude affecting thepublic weal arise, the void caused byhis departure will seem fathomless, asthe grief at his loss will be intense.As the load he carried without a mur-mur settles upon others already heavi-

 ly burdened with accumulated respon-sibilities, how vividly will they sensethe taking away of one ever ready—always willing to put a lifting shoulderto the wheel. In the future, whendark clouds of persecution are rivenby the fierce lightnings of hate, andwrathful storms beat upon defenselessheads, who can fill the place of ErastusSnow? In times of peace, when theallurements of a deceitful ease threa-tened danger in the path of unsus-pecting youth, who will be able tosupplement the wise counsel that hathlaid the foundation for many a pros-perous, pure, and patient life? Towhom now can the young go for achart to guide them over life's troubledsea, with the same confident assurancethat they have experienced in goingto him?Into what listening ear and sym-pathetic heart shall the troubled nowpour their story of distress? Whonow will console the forsaken or com-fort the grief-striken, as he has done?The poor came to him freely, and thesick and weary laid their burdensupon his shoulders without hestiation.Who will bear them now?As the knowledge that ErastusSnow is dead settles into the feelingsof the people, the fountains of emo-tion will break forth, and silent tearswill moisten many a spot where forhours he has stood patiently listeningto piteous tales, while incipient dis-ease sowed the seeds of death in hisunshrinking body; for when the sor-rows of others overshadowed him,Erastus Snow was wholly oblivious ofself.Heedless of consequences, he has stood for hours exposed to the nightwinds of a Southern desolation, moretreacherous than the snows and frostsof a Northern clime. While thus exposed, thoughtless persons havepoured into his sympathetic ears talesof troubles as if his compassionateheart could never fail to respond.But now he is dead, and the draftsof friends and the demands of enemiesmust each go to protest. His mortalcareer is ended. For the cause of histaking away we must search amid theburning sands and gleaming volcanicrocks of Southern Utah, where hasbeen spent the best years of his life.Many a weary night he had soughtrepose while exhausted nature—sweat-ing at every pore—was chilled by thewinds sweeping the cactus plains ofMexico or sighing through the pinesof the Sierra Madre. To those who,in their misguided enforcement of thelaw, have deprived him of the conso-lation and comforts of home, whatshall the harvest be? Under tryingcircumstances he recently endured a severe operation upon his eyes. Ex-hausted by the pain inflicted, andwhile trying to rest in a room and bed to which he was unused, he contracteda severe cold that resulted in hisdeath.Not long since a brother in deepaffliction exclaimed, "I would givemore this moment to see ErastusSnow than any man living, for hecould tell me what to do in this hourof supreme trial."Measure his life's work, and howbeautiful and perfect in every part itnow in the presence of death seems.As husband and father, tender andtrue, affectionate and just. As friendand brother, devoted and unchange-able. As statesman and scholar, pro-found and farseeing. As defender ofconstitutional liberty, valiant and con-sistent. As a servant of God, faith-ful, devoted, true. Magnanimous toenemies, generous to friends. Un-swerving in life, trusting and confidentin death. Such was Erastus Snow.Let the fingers of fame weave garlandswith which to entwine the brow ofbattle-begrimmed heroes! Let ambi-tion sing from monumental piles the praises of those who in life wrought carnage and death; but for us, wewill keep fresh in our hearts thememory of the good and true whosemission was devoted to life, not death.He has left us to join those gonebefore. Let us emulate his works,follow his example, and when thronesshall totter and kingdoms fall, joy-fully in his mansion home shall greethim "wives, children, and friends."Apostle John Henry Smith said:It seems almost impossible for me tosufficiently control my feelings tospeak to you.

 whole Christian world. The signs[of] the times indicate the coming of [the] Son of Man in power and great [glo]ry. But before His coming the [go]spel has got to be preached to all[n]ations. We have been preaching[th]e gospel for 50 years, and by it a [illegible] have gathered out from the na-[tio]ns of the earth to these valleys of[the] mountains. That is why the [wo]rld hate us. It is because the [Lo]rd has called us out of the world [to] establish the everlasting gospel.[An]d I want to say to the Latter-day [Sai]nts: Have faith in the revela-tions of God; have faith in the pro-[m]ises that have been given. We[sh]ould be preparing ourselves for the[gre]at events that swait us. Dark-[ne]ss covers the earth and gross[da]rkness the people. The Lord is[wit]hdrawing His Spirit from the[na]tions of the earth, and the power[of] the devil is gaining dominion [ov]er the children of men. See how[t]ime is increasing. Fifty years ago [wh]en the Book of Mormon was [tr]anslated by Joseph Smith there [w]as not one murder where there [ar]e a thousand to-day; there [wa]s not one whoredom where[th]ere are a thousand to-day;[an]d so you may go through the [wh]ole black catalogue of crime.  Whatsoever a man soweth, that [sha]ll he also reap." "With what [me]asure ye mete, it shall be mea-[sur]ed to you." Look at the wicked-[ness] that is on the increase in the[wo]rld, covering the earth like the [wat]ers of the great deep. What will [the] end be? Death, destruction, [whirl]winds, pestilence, famine and[ the ju]dgments of God will be poured [ou]t upon the wicked; for the Lord[has] withheld these judgments until[the] world is fully warned. To this [end] we have been laboring diligent-ly for 50 years, so far as we have had[oppo]rtunity. But all these judg-[me]nts will come. The seals will be[open]ed; plague will follow plague;[the] sun and the moon will be dark-[en]ed; and the unbelief of the world [wil]l make no difference to all these [thi]ngs coming to pass.I have a desire with you, as Lat-[ter]-day Saints, that we may keep [the] faith, overcome the world and [mag]nify our high and holy callings.  [We] will be held responsible before[the] Lord for the light we possess.[We] should be diligent and faithful [in] our labors, for if we turn our backs [o]n the truth, once having known [it] we will be under far greater con-[de]mnation than those who rejected [th]e truth. What we may be called [u]pon to suffer for the gospel's sake is [n]either here nor there. This nation and every other nation is in the hands of God. Your destiny is inthe hands of God. Men can go no [fu]rther than the Lord will permit[the]m to go.

 associate with him and his family. Ithas also been my privilege to minglewith him in councils, and in suchplaces as try men's souls. I have never known him for one moment todoubt or hesitate in regard to the workGod had imposed upon him. In hishome, gentle and affectionate; pru-dent in his exmple; consistent andwise in his language; loving and kind,and as just as God has made mortalman. In traveling with him I haveoften wondered at the inspirationwhich guided him, especially in talk-ing to the young. His words of coun-sel fell in the kindest accents; hisrebukes were administered in fearless-ness, and were followed by kindess.He possessed a judicial mind, and hadhe followed the profession of the lawnone would have excelled him for thegreatness of his decisions. God waswith him. I have seen His powermanifest in him. Brother Erastushas worthily performed the labors ofan apostle. He was among the fore-most in toil, usually working till theearly hours of the morning. When itwas found necessary to settle the de-sert soil of Southern Utah, ErastusSnow was called, and faltered not inthe midst of difficulty. Frequently,when his body was racked with pain,he would go into the fields and coun-sel with the people. He was alsofather of the settlements in Arizona.There is no tribute that is not due toErastus Snow. As a preacher of theGospel, he was eloquent; as a colon-izer, true; as a legislator, wise; as acouncilor, fearless; as a friend, un-swerving; as a father, unexcelled inlove and integrity. I have looked upon him as one of the brightest ofearth's sons, and, had he remained inhis native State, he would have shonein the councils of the nation. May the blessings of heaven rest on hisnumerous family, and may we say of them, they were worthy descendantsof a noble sire, who was devoted tothe work of God.Apostle Smith then read the fol-lowing letter from President WilfordWoodruff:Beloved Brethren and Sisters,Once again, in the providences of theAlmighty, Israel mourns the loss ofone of its mightiest sons. Death sel-dom comes at a time we deem oppor-tune; and if we, in our blindess,were permitted to judge, we shouldcertainly decide that the present, withits trials, its perplexities, and its sor-rows, is no time to take from our midst men of counsel, of wisdom, offaith, and of judgment, such as was our beloved brother, Elder ErastusSnow, whose obsequies we this daysolemnize. But He who doeth allthings well has been pleased to taketo Himself His servant, and we cansimply bow the head and acknowledgeHis hand in all things, and with oneof old exclaim: "The Lord giveth,and the Lord taketh away; blessedbe the name of the Lord."The peculiarities of our positionprevent us from personally joiningwith you in this tribute of respect toour departed, and now sanctified,brother, whose departure from thismortal sphere has doubtless beenhastened by the same causes that pre-vent us from joining you on this sadoccasion. This enforced absence wesincerely regret, as we should havefound a mournful satisfaction in add-ing our testimony to that of ourbrethren, touching the virtues, the in-tegrity, the zeal, the whole-hearted-ness, of our friend and co-labourerwho has passed before us into thejoys of eternity. For him we have no cause to mourn; he has fought thegood fight, he has finished his work,he has been true and faithful, and isnow entering into that fairer andbetter world, the bliss of which theheart cannot conceive nor the natural eye see, but the glories of which, by reason of his obedience and devotionto God and His laws, had been sealedupon him through sacred ordinancesand by the Holy Spirit of Promisewhile he yet tabernacled in mortality.May our end be like his.The name of Erastus Snow willnever be forgotten in the history ofthe Church of Christ. From earlyyouth to his latest day he was everfound in the unflinching performanceof his duties as a servant of the MostHigh. Without exaggeration it canbe said of him that he died with theharness on. In every position he wascalled to fill—and they were many—he exhibited those nobler traits which

Not but what there have been variouscommunications, as in this case, in speaking of the"Gospel of Abraham"; but we find this manifestation in most of all the ministrations of the Aaronicor Levitical Priesthood, and this very strongly manifestwith John the Baptist, who was the last personagewho held, as it were, the Aaronic Priesthood on theearth at the coming of the Messiah. Of course thehistory of this we are all acquainted with. Johnthe Baptist had power to administer in the ordinancesof the Gospel as far as the Levitical or AaronicPriesthood was concerned, and this priesthood, wesee was given to the house of Israel, whilethe Melchesedec Priesthood, and the Gospel ofChrist, the fulness of that gospel, was takenfrom them ^in the days of^^in the days of Moses^.

 dignify the character of a Saint. Ifwe view him as a missionary of theGospel of peace, as a legislator for thepeople of God, as a pioneer, convert-ing the wilderness into the fruitfulfield, as an apostle in the councilsof the Church, we everywhere findhim a man of no ordinary type, butone whose ability and strength ofcharacter marked him as a leaderamong men, even where great menwere not lacking. It would be diffi-cult for us to pick out any one specialdepartment of life and say in this hemost particularly shone, or selectsome other and assert in that he wasmost eminent. He was great in all.To the sons and daughters of Scan-dinavia he was perhaps greater as amissionary—the first apostle who borethe glad tidings of the Gospel to theirfatherland. To the weary toiler be-neath the sultry sun of Southern Utahhe was best known as the indefatig-able leader, who planned, devised, con-trived and arranged for their progressand made prosperity possible in one ofthe most arid, most forbidding regionsof this great continent. His prudence,his wisdom, his foresight, are admittedby all—as a counselor he had fewpeers. His ripe experience, joinedwith his sound judgment, gave aweight to his words and a strength tohis counsels that all who heard felt.Moreover, he possessed, unclouded bystain, those two great virtues thatgive a man power with the heavens—integrity and purity of character. Leta man possess these, let his heart betrue and unflinching, let his life bepure, and, if we add to these humility,he is proof against a multitude ofweaknesses and can resist a host oftemptations. We all have our weak-nesses; God has permitted them thatwe might be taught humility in our-selves and charity towards others.We none of us are perfect whilst wedwell in the flesh; but the man whoin humble reliance upon God neverfalters in the fight for the right, neverwavers in his allegiance to the truth,and ever maintains inviolate hiscovenants, is one whom we can allpause to admire, and strive, byheaven's help, to imitate. Such menare few when compared with the un-numbered hosts who have peopledthis earth of ours; but we thank Godthat we do find them more abundantly in the midst of the Saints, holdingthe Holy Priesthood and ministeringin things the most sacred ever be-stowed upon humanity. Among these,in the front ranks, is our esteemedbrother whose mortal remains areabout to be consigned to the tomb.For nearly forty years Brother Snowhas been one of the twelve apostlesof the Lord Jesus. To this calling hehas given the strength of his primeand the wisdom of his later years. It has been during this period that hehas performed a very large portion ofhis missionary, legislative and pioneerservices. We shall sadly miss him inthe quorum with which he has been solong identified, and of which he wasat the time of his death one of theoldest members. We shall miss hismature consideration, his deliberatethoughts, his experienced advice—allmost needful at a time when thepowers of evil are assailing us in somany directions. But we thank theLord that though from time to timeHe takes from us those who, as men,we trust most fondly, yet He leavesus not entirely to ourselves, but con-tinues unto us the signs of His ap-proval. We are comforted with the assurance that this is His kingdom,and that He rules in the heavens andupon the earth; and that from thefall of a sparrow to the death of anapostle all is known unto Him, andnothing happens without His sanction.And further, brethren and sisters,are we not the sons and daughters ofGod, and when he shall appear, if weare faithful, shall we not be like him?Yes; and when the glorious day ar-rives we shall once more have theprivilege of standing upon this earthand meeting in joy and thanksgiving,not only our brother who has just leftus, but Joseph and Brigham, andthousands of others who have washedtheir robes white in the blood of theLamb, and who, through the meritsof His atonement, are anointed kingsand priests unto God, and with Himreign exalted in His kingdom. Maywe all be found worthy of this reward;and now, while we travel through thisworld of change and sorrow, may wetake pattern by the lives of the

 7Baptist, and that was the baptising of the Messiah,which I think is a very strong argument, should be withall men who have any faith with regard to the Gospelof Jesus Christ or the ordinances of Salvation. Jesuscame to John to be baptised in Jordan. John said to him, "I have need to be baptised of thee, andcomest thou to me? And Jesus answering saidunto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomethus to fulfil all righteousness." I do not know ofa stronger argument or testimony on all therevelations of God that should be more convincingto the human family with regard to this ordinance,that it is necessary to the salvation of the childrenof men, than in this instance. I do not saythat the Saviour was baptised for the remissionof sins, I do not know that he ever committedany, I have no testimony that he ever did,for his calling ^&^ his position was altogether
