 from your Brother in the   Gospel  W. T. Jones    I am satisfied that he would  feel better, if he only could  muster faith and courage   and. go.  Jenkin Jones    As he has declined to accept  the cal, I would suggest  to him, that if he would like  to take six months or a year's  time to settle up his debts  and prepare for a mission,   that it will be satisfactory.   Meantime he could report  at any time he was ready.  J. F. S.    [Upside-Down Text]  W. T. Jones  March 12 [18]95.  [End Upside-Down Text]

 Dresden, the 14th. April 1896.    To the  Presidency of the Church of Latter Day Saints,  Salt Lake C[it]y. Utah.    Dear Sirs,  I have been variously communi-  cating with your missionaries and as I always  have taken a deep interest in your institutions,  to be sure more from the standpoint of the  social science than from that of the religion,  I shall always be glad to learn about your  development. As to joining your church myself,  dear Sirs, you may be firmly assured that it  is not the question of faith, which keeps me  away from you but simply the full know-  ledge that with the circumstances in these parts  lying as they are anyone engaged for socialism  is so much engaged in the political questions  that, taking the care for existence into the  bargain, it would be simply mental sui-  cide to bother about religion. If I was in  the U. S. or if I had known you during  my stay over there you may take it for  granted that I would be a member of your  church in fact, now I cannot anything else

It was also voted that this conference sanction the appointment by the authori-  ties in Nauvoo, of elder Wilford Woodruff to the presidency of the churches in  Great Britain, and also pledges itself to uphold him therein by faith and prayer.    It was also voted that the conference recognise and uphold elder Reuben Hed-  lock as his first counsellor.

 St George Utah, June 7th [18]96    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:  My call to the mission-  ary field was duly received.    I take pleasure in  announcing my willingness  to respond.    I have ever tried to obey   the calls made upon me  by those holding the   Holy Priesthood; and   with the help of the Lord  I hope to fulfill this   one.    Your Brother in the Gospel  Chas H.

 I can easily glean some facts out of some  lexicon or encyclopedia, but the history related  therein usually relates facts, without giving  the reasons, how this and that has happened.  Just these however are the thing, we aim to  get the knowledge of. So f. e. [for example] it is told in one  that you were driven out of Missouri on HC.  of deprecations committed by your people, because  you had robbed property, cattle, etc. I even know  a novelF going as far as ascribing to you the  robbing of women for immoral purposes. Now  that all this is nonsense is sure, nevertheless it  is written again and again, though mere  meditation might teach anyone that even  now and much less at these times any^no^thing  could be robbed from a farmer except perhaps  a cow or a horse, and of these your people  had plenty as the same writer says your people  were in well off circumstance. The balances  tip much more to the contrary, that the igno-  rant populace got incited to rob your stores etc  and that their religious ire was incensed by  the avarice and not at all by any divine or  any other reason.    But I fear I took already too much  of your time. Would you kindly give me    [text in the left margin] F not a  history [end of text in the left margin]

 but consider myself as belonging to you in the  spirit, without being officially in your body.    Now, dear Sirs, I beg to approach you  with the following request. Leaving all religous  questions aside your prophet Josef Smith  tried in his way to solve the social problems  of his time and as far as the little knowledge  goes, which I could gather about these facts,  (very little known here) I reckon he has solved  it about it in the best manner possible for  his time and your church has done the best it  could to keep in his tracks. That you couldnot  keep out of the encroachments of capitalism  is something inevitable and your history of the  last 20 years at least was less one of religious  strive [strife], but of the agressments of outsiders trying  to destroy your institutions more than your  religion, which in the main would leave them  cold.    To get fully acquainted with all these  matters referring to the social institutions  of your church from its earliest time has  now been my chief desire since long time, and  I beg to address myself to you, asking you to  kindly furnish my with the necessary details.  I am asked to hold a lecture about your  history etc. next fall. Now you may be sure

 a report of the means advised by your prophets  and elders etc. to provide for the laboring, now  posseding class, how the distribution of food  clothing etc was tended to in the old times,  further how these institutions have developped  themselves etc. It would be also interesting  not only to me but to many of our people  to learn how the ideal of government would  be thought from you.    Besides this I think it would be greatly  interesting to learn about the present develop-  ment, to learn how the labor question is being  dealt with by you now, how industry is deve-  lopping etc. etc.    So f. e. [for example] how the Lehi Sugar factory,  of which I read in the "Stern" is going on,  how the price of the material, the pece per-  centage of sugar gained from the beets etc.  all these matters would be specially interesting  in the present moment, where they are going  to grant new millions for the encouragement  of sugar export, while our people cannot buy  any because it is too dear.    But I shall cut this letter short and  hope you will favour me with the information  desired.

 REVELATION AND JUDGMENT.    Remarks at the Weber Stake Confer-  ence, Ogden, Sunday, July  15, 1894, by    PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Reported by Arthur Winter.]    I feel very refreshed to get away from   home once in a while and mingle with   the people, and listen to the teachings,   revelations and prophecies of the pro-  phets, apostles, seers and revelators   among the Latter-day Saints. I am   glad to meet with the Saints today in   Ogden.    I have a good many things upon my   mind that I do not expect I shall ex-  press here this afternoon; but a few   things I want to say.    The subject of revelation is frequently   referred to. We occupy a position be-  fore God, angels and men, and at least   one world, that is very interesting and   important. God never gave to man a   dispensation of more importance than   the one you and I live in; and to sup-  pose that this Zion of God, this great   work of preparing the way for the final   triumph of the Son of God and the estab-  lishment of His throne and kingdom on   earth could pass through a generation   without revelation is one of the most   mysterious things on the face of the   earth. God never had a people or a   Church in any age of the world that   was not governed by men who held the   Holy Priesthood and the keys of the   kingdom of God, and those men were   obliged to have revelation. We have   the records containing some of their   revelations before us.    With regard to this dispensation I   want to give you some of my views. In   the first place, the dispensation was   pointed out and proclaimed through   the mouth of almost every prophet that   has ever dwelt in the flesh. These   prophets pointed to this Zion, to this   work, to this gathering together, and   to the warning of the world by prophets,   apostles and elders, called of God to   go out and proclaim the Gospel and   warn the nations, that they might be   left without excuse in the days of God's   visitation of judgment upon the world.  There is no Elder who has gone out to   preach and who has baptized anybody   but knows that he has had to have   revelation to enable him to magnify   his calling. He could not live without  this and do his duty. In the commence-  ment of this work the Lord raised up a   man to be a prophet, seer and revelator.    Joseph Smith was kept in the spirit   world for thousands of years to be born   in the flesh at the right time, and to be   inspired of God, to be visited by Him,   and to be qualified and prepared for the   mission given into his hands. How long   did Joseph Smith live in the flesh after   he organized this Church? A little over   fourteen years. What did he do during   that time? He organized the Church of   God, upon the foundation of apostles   and prophets, Christ Jesus being the   chief corner stone. He also gave unto   us a code of revelations. No more   sublime revelations were ever given by   God to man. Read the Bible, the Book   of Mormon, and all the books on earth,   and then read these revelations, and   you will see the Spirit of God, not only   in him, but in the dispensation in which   these revelations were given. He gave   us a foundation to work upon, and rev-  elations to guide us and carry us into   the celestial kingdom. The question   may be asked, How is it with regard to   those that followed him? Where are   the revelations of President Young?    Do you find them on record? Only a   few; but the Holy Ghost and the revela-  tions of God were with Brigham Young   from the day that he received this   Gospel until the day that he laid down   his life and his tabernacle was carried   to the grave. There was no necessity   particularly for Brigham Young to give   written revelation, only in a few instan-  ces. So with John Taylor. So with   Wilford Woodruff. And so in a great   measure probably with all who may   follow us, until the coming of the Son  of man. But are we without revelation?    We are not. We know our duty, and   in a measure we know what lies before   us. Some of the people have had the   idea that the Presidency of this Church   and the Twelve Apostles should have   nothing to do with temporal matters.    Well, we would be in a bad fix if we did   not deal in temporal matters. Joseph   Smith stood at the head of this dispensa-  tion all the days he dwelt in the flesh. So   did Brigham Young. I traveled with Brig-  ham Young at home and abroad, and I   never saw a day in my life but what he  had the spirit and power of revelation of   God with him. This power was with him  when he came to this land. It was with   him when he laid the foundations of our   temples, and when he laid out the city   of Salt Lake. He did all these things   by the inspiration and Spirit of Almighty   God.    The Lord requires a great deal of this   people. The Elders of Israel were   called from the various occupations of   life to go and preach the Gospel. They   preached to you in your native lands.    They told you, in the name of the Lord,  if you would receive the Gospel, repent   of your sins, and be baptized for the   remission of them, you should receive   the Holy Ghost. Did you not receive   it? Yes, you did, or else you have no   business here. You would not be here   if you had not been inspired by the   Spirit of God. These are truths, and   you know them for yourselves. The   fruits of the Gospel have been manifest   from the beginning of this Church, and   will be until the scene is wound up.    I saw a curious thing here today as I   came to meeting. I saw a military camp   at the depot. It brought a flood of re-  flection to my mind. I traveled with   Joseph Smith, sixty years ago this sum-  mer, one thousand miles, to Jackson   County, Missouri, our brethren having   been driven by a military body from   their homes. We went up there and   accomplished all we were sent to do.  We have had military gatherings in this   land for the last sixty years. We had  quite a military display in Jackson   County. We had a military gathering  in Clay County. We had a military   gathering in Ray County, and in Cald-  well County. What were all these mili-  tary gatherings for? Was their object  to protect the railroads of the nation?   Not at all. What was their purpose?   It was to drive the Latter-day Saints, to   destroy them, to take their property,  and root them out of the earth if they   had the power; and except for the   power of God they would have accom-  plished it. I was singularly struck in  looking at this military body. What  are they here for? Are they here to   drive the "Mormons" out of Ogden? It   does not look like it. I think it is to  protect the property of these railroads.   What does all this mean? Does it not  mean that there is a change of affairs in  the earth? What are the signs of the  times? Do the Latter-day Saints com-  prehend them? This is a fast age. The  Lord is going to cut His work short in   righteousness. Read these revelations,  for they contain the history of what is   going to pass in the earth. The Lord  said to Joseph in the beginning of this   Church:    "Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels  are crying unto the Lord day and night, who   are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap   down the fields;    But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up  the tares while the blade is yet tender, (for   verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the  wheat also.    Therefore let the wheat and the tares grow   together until the harvest is fully ripe, then ye  shall first gather out the wheat from among the  tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, be-  hold and lo! the tares are bound in bundles,  and the field remaineth to be burned."    What is the matter with the world   today? What has created this change   that we see coming over the world?    Why these terrible earthquakes, torna-  does, and judgments? What is the mean-  ing of all these mighty events that are  taking place? The meaning is, these   angels that have been held for many

 Randolph Sept 12th 1896,    Pres Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother,    I received yours  of Sept. 8th, 1896 as to me   taking a Southern States   mission. In answer say,  I feel like going and  fulfilling my mission  to the best of my  abbility and will present   my self at the Historians  Office at your appointed   date Nov. 9th, 1896.

 years in the temple of our God have got   their liberty to go out and commence  their mission and their work in the   earth, and they are here today in the  earth.  I feel bold in saying this to the  Latter-day Saints.  There is a meaning  in these judgments.  The word of the  Lord cannot fall unfulfilled.  If you  want to know what is coming to pass,   read the revelations of St. John, read  the Book of Mormon and the Book of   Doctrine and Covenants, and these  things are at our door.  What is the  matter with this nation?  Thousands of   men striking, mobs rising up and des-  troying property, and tribulation pre-  vailing!  I want to say that you will all  find before you are many years older that Utah is a pretty  good place to live in.  So far as our temporal matters are   concerned, we have got to go to work  and provide for ourselves.  The day   will come when, as we have been told,  we shall all see the necessity of making  our own shoes and clothing and raising  our own food, and uniting together to  carry out the purposes of the Lord.   We will be preserved in the mountains  of Israel in the day of God's judgment.   I therefore say to you, my brethren and  sisters, prepare for that which is to  come.  You have a great future before   you.  There is a change coming over  the world with regard to Zion.  The  day is coming when the world will say,  "Let us not go up to battle against Zion,  for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible;  wherefore we cannot stand."  They will  find that the power of God is with this  people.  We want to prepare ourselves  for this, and sanctify ourselves before  the Lord that we may be prepared to   carry out our mission.  Revelation is with us, and it is with  you.  Let us be united and do our duty.  Search the scriptures, for they testify of  these things.  I pray God that His  blessings may be over us, that our eyes  may be opened to see, our ears to hear,   and our hearts to understand the things   of the kingdom of God, that we may be  prepared to work with those upon the  other side of the veil; for these great  events that are rolling upon the earth   will come to pass, and no power on   earth can stay them.  They are declared   by the revelations of God and must be  fulfilled.  God bless us all and lead us  into all truth, for Jesus' sake.  Amen.

Salt Lake City, Utah, Decr. 22, 1891896    Presidents Woodruff, Cannon and Smith.    Dear Brethren:    Having secured the agency for the Graph-  ophone and other talking machines, for Utah, the idea is  presented to my mind that it would be very valuable to the  rising generation if we could record on special cylinders the  tesytimonyies of yourselves and other leading Brethren, so that  with your own voices you might speak to those who have not the  privilege of hearing you now in person, but who would be edified  and strengthened by your testimonies in the future. Partic-  ularly am I desirous of securing that of President Woodruff. How  valuable his testionmony would be in years to come, is apparent  when we consider that the testimony of the Prophet Joesph and   those of the other Presidents of the Church who have passed  away, would give us untold pleasure, if we could hear them now.   They would be priceless, and the benefit to be derived from  hearing their testimonies of the truth, by those who never saw  these great men, would be beyond ^present^ conception. I have some   excellent machoines, and would like the privilege of an interview  with you, when I would bring one and you could speak into it.  I would supply one copy of each record for the Hoistorian's   Office, for preservation, and only ask the privilege of keeping   others like them for my own use. No charge will be made for

In order to obtain  the best results in recording, permit me to suggest that what  each speaker desires to say be written down, and then he can  read it into the Graphophone, which will reproduce it at once,   and it can be compared with the writing, until the speaker is   satisfied with the testimony as recoreded and reproduced. Perhaps  what could be recoreded on one cylinder would be sufficient for   each person. Say about 550 words.    The contents of this letter will first be read by the  Graphophone in my voice, so as to show you how correct and  unimpeachable is this scientific record. I will meet you at   your office at any time you may suggest, on receiving notice  when to come. President Cannon knows something of the records  made on the old style Graphophone, and now we have a greatly  improved machine, in every way.

 Rockville Jan 4, 1896    Presidents Woodruff Cannon and Smith.    Dear Brethren    I have had it in mind for some time to enter a home-  stead. As this is a step which would com-  promise me for 5 years at least, and as I feel it  might involve a loss, or prevent me from doing  something else my maker might desire me to do, I   thought it prudent to seek counsel before doing so.    The land I had thought to enter as a  homestead is situated in the N. W. corner of Kane  County about 30 miles ^East^ of Cedar city; is in the  high mts on the headwaters of the Rio Virgen River.    It may be irrelevant to give you   the locality of the land; as the two points on  which I have doubts as to whether it would   be right, and causes me to doubt the wisdom  of my intentions are:    1st Would it be right to isolate myself and part  of my family, at least half my time for 5 years  from any organized ward where I could attend  meetings or assist as a help to the Priesthood?    2 Would my assistance be wanted in the next  5 years in the missionary field or elsewhere  wherein I would be handicapped by homesteading?    I would greatly appreciate a few   words of counsel sometime during the winter if not too great an  intrusion on your valuable time. Your Bro. David. F. Stout    [sideways text] If bro. Stout feels that the land should be secured, and it is a proper and  reasonable investment for his future welfare, I think he should be a perfect  liberty to enter the same. And should his services be needed, in the mean time,  kind providence will open his way. Let him do what he thinks proper and good  for himself & family in the matter, with approval of the local authorities.  [Jospeh Fielding Smith|J. F. S. [end of sideways text]

 The Masculine  Element  Has Gone From  St. John's   in the   South Seas,  and   Thousands of  Women   Clamor for   Husbands.  Husbands are wanted on the St. John's   group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.  Captain Bergman of the American ship  Bonanza says that bashful young men  afraid to pop the question need not go  through the world without a mate if they   will only go to these little coral islands in   the Southern seas.  The Captain's ship was becalmed a few  months ago close to the main island of the  group and for nearly a whole day she lay  scarcely moving a foot. In that time he   and every man of his crew had more offers  of marriage than they could count on their   fingers and toes and go over them a second   time.   The ship was besieged with women seek-  ing husbands, and for a time the Captain  said the women threatened to carry himself  and his crew ashore and marry them  whether they favored the match or not.  The Captain, in a report to the United  States Hydrographic office of this manless  Eden and the numerous offers of marriage  made to him and his crew, says he only  escaped by promising to come back in a few  days with a whole shipload of men and  give every one of the clamoring maidens a   good husband.  The St. John's islands are known to most   of the South-sea traders as the Hermit isles.  They are the only inhabited reefs in the  souther archipelago that have not been

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  MILLENNIAL STAR.    Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to  the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.---REV. xxii, 14.    No. 19, Vol. XLIV   Monday, May 8, 1882   Price One Penny.    APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF    Asked the question whether it is pro-  per to say what the Spirit dictates, or  what would please the children of   men. His own feelings were that it  is the kingdom of God or nothing, and   he desired nothing outside of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints, for no kingdoms, thrones, prin-  cipalities, salvation or exaltation can  be received outside the kingdom of   God. Man may own some of these  possessions for a few days, but at a   given time they are all buried in one  common grave. Every Prophet and

You, perhaps, are  aware that I was called to  take a mission to the Southern  States last September, but  owing to the fact that I had  contracted to teach school  until spring it was post-  poned until then.

 [Clarence J. Elliott Nov 23 96  contaminated by the beachcomber and the   insolent trader whose shiftless presence on  islands in direct communication with civi-  lization has done so much toward influenc-  ing the South-sea natives toward lives of  crime and debauchery.    The natives are of the Papuan race, and  up to a few years ago several traders who  tried to barter some of their gaudy calicos  and gew-gaws for the products of the island  furnished inviting repasts for the chiefs  and head men of the islands. Several times  such expeditions were repeated and every  time the natives enjoyed a banquet, and at  last all attempts at trade were given up.  The natives are of the same race as those  who inhabited the Solomon group. Even  fiercer were they than the Bushmen, who  a few weeks ago slaughtered Baron von  Norbeck and several of the crew of the  Austrian training ship Albatross on Gua-  dalcaner island.    These women sighing for husbands, the  Captain said, are ruled by a queen known   as Plea Waar. At one time she led the  women of her island in the many battles  they had with the inhabitants of the other  atolls of the group, but when their sorrows  came they learned that war was not all that  made them happy. Their fondness for ban-  quets at which the men of their race were  entertained brought all their present woes  and peace among all the four islands of the  group was declared. At that time only  a few hundred men remained and the wo-  men outnumbered them almost ten to one.  When that state of affairs existed the trad-  ers gained a small foothold on the islands.  The women were easily pleased with the  bright trinkets offered to them and the few  men left dared not say them nay when they  desired to make a purchase. The men meek-  ly fell into the ways of the women and the  queen was the boss of the Government. Her  chief had lost his rule. With this state  of affairs in the island a strange craft drop-  ped anchor off the reefs and in the week   that followed all the able-bodied men in    the group were induced to take passage  on the vessel for some plantations in South  America.    When the black-birder sailed away there  were left yearly two thousand women on  the island, and only a hundred old men.  Husbands they wanted, but none were to  be had. That state of affairs had existed  nearly a year when the Bonanza drifted   close to the island, and the Captain and his  crew had a narrow escape from being kid-  naped into matrimony.    Captain Bergman says the dusky belles,  as far as he could ascertain, have overcome  their fondness for human banquets, and he  assures any young men looking for an easy,  indolent life that he can do no better than  accept the offer of the queen of the St. John's  group. He can have as many wives as he   desires and a home that will be supplied  with all the luxuries of a tropical isle, and  he won't have to even ask for it if he once  sets foot in the dusky queen's domain.    "The women are by no means unattractive  in appearance," said the Captain, "although  they are ignorant of the many aids to beauty  that are known in fashionable life. They  are of simple habits and indulge in none of  the luxuries that have prevented many men  from entering into the matrimonial state.    "Their dry-goods bill, for instance, would   be inconsequential in the budget of house-  hold expenses, for they practice an economy  in dress that is simply astonishing. Their  costumes are beautiful in their simplicity  and set off their charms in a bewitching  manner. Nor because they are of a canni-  balistic race should it be supposed that they  are devoid of that true affection which  should mark the partner of one's bosom.  True enough, it might at times be somewhat  unpleasant to contemplate at dinner a shin-  bone or two and wonder whether they were  the remains of a lately deceased mutton or  once carried some other fellow. Yet, sur-  rounded by all the comforts of a home in   the dreamiest of South-sea islands, where    all nature teaches one to love, a man who  casts his lot upon any of the islands of St.  John and allows himself to be carried into  wedlock, might easily imagine himself su-  premely happy.    "When we anchored off the main island  the Bonanza was besieged with the dusky  charmers, all willing to be wed. Some came  off in canoes and others swam from the   shore, but whether they arrived on deck,  glistening with the nut oil, which is their  greatest beautifier, or dripping with brine,  all came with the same mission.    "Husbands they demanded as a right.  They had nothing to say about the suffrage  question, nor did they discuss the tem-  perance problem. Not even the most world-  ly wise wished to exact a promise that her  chosen one would stay home o'nights and  not run around to the other islands, talking  politics. They promised not to gossip and  to be obedient in all things if only some  one would marry them right away.    "I had a hard time preventing that army  of women from carrying off my entire crew.  They only way I could escape was to promise  to return with a shipload of gay young   beaux who would permit themselves to be  loved, petted, and fed on cocoanuts and  yams until the end of their days.    "Plea Waar, the warlike Queen of the   forsaken Papuans, is a very remarkable  woman. Tall, muscular and of a command-  in presence, she would attract attention  anywhere. As she is the absolute monarch  of all she surveys, including the surround-  ing reefs and atolls that are unsurveyed,  she would be a great prize for the lucky  man who might win her dusky heart and  not bloodless hand. Since the disappearance  of all the men on the islands her nature has  become greatly softened, and she now plues,   as do her maidens, for the presence of the  dear departed.    "It was whispered that she had made a   ragout out of one or two of her husbands  who had not lived up to her expectations    but no white man need fear any such fate.  The St. John's natives acknowledge a lik-  ing now and then for a bit of native flesh,  done brown, but white man's meat, they say,  has such a salty flavor that it is unpalatable.    "One charming characteristic of these  women is the absence among them of jeal-  ousy. A man may have as many wives as   he wants and be happy with any when the  other dear charmers are away. It would  be a great place for Mormon missionaries.  They might take down there a hundred or   two of the young scions of Zion and estab-  lish a branch kingdom in the South seas.  The possibilities of such a scheme are be-  yond computation. The Queen would ac-  cept the Mormons with open arms.    "St. John's group never having been very  popular with traders, the women are like  the trees and fruit of their island home ---  nature's own creations. Like the Samoans  and Gilbert islanders, they have well-round-  ed forms and are of the temperament that is  fostered by the warm sun of the tropics.    "In my opinion, it would really be a pay-  ing proposition for a company of benevolent  Christians to charter a vessel and send to  St. John's a consignment of the unemploy-  ed to become husbands for the lonely women  of the sea-girt isles. For every husband  delivered the Queen would be willing to  exchange a ton of cocoanuts or anything  else that might be preferred. There is in  this proposition a magnificent opportunity  to make a fortune that should not be over-  looked."    The sailors of the Bonanza are quite as  enthusiastic as their Captain over the lone-  ly and loving women of the manless Eden   of the South Pacific.    "Say," said one of them, "I never see  such a sight, and I've sailed in all the waters  on the globe. Why, they just swarmed  over the lee rail like a lot of monkeys. And  mebbe they ain't hummers! Why, I hope  to never go to sea again if I ever see  before so much female loveliness all to-    gether at one time. They are mostly wo-  men of middle stature, but what they lack  in height they make up in development.  Why, between you and me, if I could have  done it on the quiet, I would have just ma-  rooned myself down there on that island  and taken a couple of years off to enjoy life.    "There was one of 'em who was a stun-  ner, and no mistake. She was just as  bright as a dollar, and had big, watery eyes  that were just full of love. She was taken  with me, I could see that, and I hated to  unclasp her arms from my neck and tell  her I was an orphan and couldn't marry   without my Captain's consent.    "All they want is mates. That's all.  And they ain't proud, neither. If they  can't get mates, why, they'll be satisfied  with a bos'on, or even a plain ordinary  seaman like me. Between you and me, I  think they would even take the cook or  a landlubber.    "I never saw such a lot of love-sick  maidens in all my born days, and I'm no  chicken, either. The Captain had to keep  an eye to windward, or else he would have  lost every man jack of us, I'm thinkin'. It's  pretty hard, I tell yer, to have to tell a lov-  ing maiden that you can't marry her --- and  she with sections of islands to throw into  the bargain; but we had to do it. The  skipper wouldn't take no nonsense.    "But, say, between me and you, myself  and some of the boys are a-goin' back  there some day and, if you believe your  uncle, if we don't have miles of cocoanuts,  and be mighty big chiefs ourselves, why  then I'll swallow my kit, that's all."    This story is reminiscent of a portion of  that unsurpassed tale of Hermann Melville,  a greater Clark Russell whose sea stories of  forty years ago are still read with great in-  terest by all acquainted with the English  tongue. Mr. Melville's description of how  the vessel on which he was aboard was be-  sieged by the amazons of a South-sea isle  is so nearly analagous to the experience of

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    Apostle that has lived upon the earth  has prophecied of this great day and   dispensation. I have lived in this   Church nearly fifty years, and have  watched its organization and growth  from nearly the first, and have known   frown the first, and know to-day, that   Joseph Smith was raised up and sus-  tained by the Lord to do the work of   opening up this dispensation. Every-  one who expects to obtain part or  parcel in this kingdom without trials,  will be greatly mistaken. The growth  of this Church has been very similar  to the parable of the mustard seed, in  every one of its stages. The speaker   desired to impress one thing upon his   hearers---viz, if this was not the  Church and Kingdom of God, the  world would not hate you---the world  loved its own; but if the people love   righteousness the world will hate  them. Jesus and his disciples were  not popular among the Jews; they  thought he had come to take their  place and nation. The speaker could  remember for some sixty-seven years,  and looking back on the history of  that time, he could see a great change   in the feeling of the people concerning  religious matters. In his younger  days he sat for hours hearing the  Presbyterian ministers picture the  torments of hell, where the flames  rose higher and higher and higher,  with a fervor that would scare a great  many from committing sin, but the  great ministers have knocked the   bottom out of hell, and it will hold   nobody now. Some of these mini-  sters and others who are fighting   against this work will find there is a   hell, and that it will hold them. The   learned men of to-day also say they  believe there is no God. Congress-  men, law-makers, statesmen and others  laugh at you when you describe the  hand of God in the events of the day.   The Latter-day Saints believe in a   God, know there is a God, and intend  to follow the instructions revealed  through his servants. A Congress-  man said to one of my brethren lately:    "If that bill passes, God have mercy   on you Mormons!" I say, if the  men in power will persecute us, God  have mercy on them and their fami-  lies. Shall we fear and tremble be-  cause the world oppose us? I say no,   and I say yea and amen to the valiant   men who express the sentiment that   we cannot yield one principle. I have  no commandment to yield, no steps  to retrace, no principle to forswear to  please any man or men, and do not  believe that God will ever ask any of  us to do so, for the Church must be  kept intact, and those who cannot  feel the conviction that I do, will do  so before ten years are past. We  have a future, a high destiny, and   that God who has raised up a king-  dom on the earth is not asleep. He   may allow trials to test his people, but  we must not sell our Gospel or any  of its principles, and if any are weak-  kneed they are not wanted in this  Church. I have seen the banks of   the Mississippi lined with thousands   of men, women and children in the  mud and in the rain, driven there by  a Governor, but it will all come out  right. I have never broken any law  of the land, that I know of, that has  been constitutional. The principles  of the Constitution were given to our  forefathers by inspiration, but their  grandsons are discarding it, and rend-  ing it, and if this course is not stopped  the whole of the props of liberty will   be lost. I want to say to our ene-  mies or friends that it costs a great  deal to shed the blood of God's peo-  ple. The Jews crucified Jesus, and  since then thousands, and perhaps  millions of Jews have been crucified  or died unnatural deaths. There  were two men killed in Carthage  jail, and the country has had to pay a  big price in blood for that murder,  and the bill is not all paid yet. A  number of Congressmen expressly  stated in the legislative halls at Wash-  ington that they could not vote for  the bill which has been passed re-  cently, because it was so glaringly un-  consitutional, and all the Congress-  men know it is unconstitutional. This  warfare is not between Congress and  the handful of people in these moun-  tains; it is a warfare between God   and man, and God will fight our   battles. We have a court to appeal  to above the courts of this land, and   the whole of the hundred thousand  Saints should seek their private cham-  bers and petition that court and its  Judge for justice. 
 like to have it changed; but  if in your opinion it would  make the slightest difference  I am perfectly willing to go   tohe Southern States.

In regard to call; my feelings are to go whereever and  whenever the Lord, through His Se^r^vants, sends me.

If any choice as to date, I would  choose as late in August as possible.

 DISCOURSE  BY   ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,   DELIVERED   In the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   Sunday Afternoon, June  12th, 1881.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    The Object of Assembling together—The Sa-  crament—All people should have the privi-  lege of worshipping God according to the   dictates sf their own conscience—Why this   fnrore [furor] against the "Mormons"—Mr. Coy-  ner's statement before a Missionary Society  in Rochester—Delivery of the Gospel to   Joseph Smith—Book of Mormon and the   Bible contain the same Gospel—It required   an angel from heaven to reetore the Gospel  —The first principles—Order of the Church  —Judgments—What the blood of the Mes-  siah has cost the Jews—The gospel given  to the Gentlies—Apostacy of the Gentiles—  Polygamy—Calling of the Latter-day  Saints—This the Most Important of all  Dispensations—Increase of Wickedness—   Exhortation to be Faithful.    WE have assembled ourselves as   Latter-day Saints for the purpose of   worshipping God, of listening to in-  structions, and administering one of   the ordinances of the house of God—  the sacrament. I look upon the sa-  crament as an ordinance of great im-  portance to us; in fact, from the   days of Adam down to the days of   Jesus Christ there were sacrifices  offered; not only by Adam but by his   posterity, by Moses and the house of   Israel, and all the generations of peo-  ple who were led by the Lord—sa-  crifices were offered as a type of the  great sacrifice to be made by the  Messiah. They offered the blood of   bulls, rams and doves as a type of  the great and last sacrifice and   death of the Messiah, whose blood   was shed for the redemption of the  world. Prior to the death of the  Savior, the sacrament of the Lord's   Supper was administered to His dis-  ciples, and they informed that   they were to partake of the bread as   an emblem of the broken body of  the Lord, and of the wine—or what-  ever is made use of as a substitute  —in token of the shed blood of the  Lord Jesus Christ.    I feel disposed here to make a re-  mark and say, that if I were the   emperor of the world and  had control of every human being   that breathes the breath of life on   earth I would give to every man,  woman and child the right to wor-  ship God according to the dictates   of their own conscience, and when  I say this I speak the sentiments of  Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, the  Presidency of this Church, the  Twelve Apostles, and all the Elders  of Israel. This is the sentiment of   all the Latter-day Saints. What!  would you grant the Methodists  this privilege? Certainly. And the   Baptists? Yes, certainly. And the   Catholics, the Shakers, the Quakers?   Yes, and everybody else under   heaven. I would grant to all people   the right to enjoy their religion  without molestation. I would even   extend this privelege to the Latter-  day Saints; I would give them the  privilege of believing in the Bible  and the organization of the Church  according to the ancient pattern,   with Apostles and Prophets, Christ  Jesus being the chief corner stone.   Why would you do this? I would  do it because God himself does it.   The God of heaven grants to all his   children, every sect and party of  whatever name and denomination   under the whole heavens, their  agency and the right to worship  God according to the dictates of their  own conscience. The Lord forces  no man to heaven. He places before  him life and death, light and dark-  ness, truth and error, and having  before him all these principles he is   at liberty to worship God and believe   what he chooses. He alone is re-  sponsible to God for his actions.  Now, when I read the history of the  world in days that are past, when I   note the illiberal spirit that was   manifested and the blood that has  been shed upon the earth—for the  earth has been deluged with blood  under what is termed holy wars,   under the garb of holy religion—I   look upon it as the most ungodly   and unrighteous thing that was ever   committed upon the earth. I look   upon what is taking place to-day in   the same way. I marvel sometimes  when I see the spirit of our nation  and the feelings of the sects of to-day  toward Utah and the Latter-day   Saints. Have we ever stood in the  path of any man, sect or people with   regard to their religion? No, we have  not. We have been willing at all  times that men should preach their   doctrines and believe them unmo-  lested by us, and I would say, to ex-  press my own feelings, that if a   man believed he had to climb   a cottonwood tree three times a day  for salvation I would never hinder  him. No, this liberty, this freedom,   especially under the American Gov-  ernment of all nations under heaven,  ought to become universal. No man  or set of men should attempt to hin-  der their neighbors from enjoying  their religion. And while I say this,   and while we grant all men this  right and privilege, as we have done   here in this city, this Tabernacle and  various other buildings having been  opened to the clergymen of the day,   we have been perfectly willing, after  we have heard all they have had to   say, to accept any truth they might   have that we are not in possession   of. If thers is a man in this world   who has one truth that I have not  got, I am willing to exchange all the   errors I have got for that truth. But  we as a people claim the same right  we grant to others. We claim the   right to worship God unmolested by   our fellow men. The laws of God,  the decrees of God, the oracles of  God, as well as laws of our country  and the constitution of our govern-  ment grant this right to the human   family—yes, even to the "Mormons,"  as we are called, to the Latter-day   Saints as well as every other c[l]ass.    Then, why this tremendous furor   among the sects of the day with re-  gard to these "Mormons" and their  religion? The trouble is the world   do not know anything about our re-  ligion, they do not know what we   believe in, and if anybody forms an  idea from what they hear abroad   they hear anything but the truth.  I have been amused sometimes—I   have of late—in reading the speech-  es delivered by gentleman—clergy-  men at that—who profess to have   lived in Utah and to understand this   people. One gentleman who pro-  fesses to be acquainted here deliver-  ed a speech in Rochester, before a   missionary society, in which he stat-  ed that "there were in Utah 620,486  young persons in the Mormon dis-  trict, and it was the youthful ele-  ment that missionaries were work-  ing on." Well, now, how does this   gentleman make out 620,486 young  people out of 140,000? I do not know   by what process of mathematics, or   by what rule he arrives at this ques-  tion. That gentleman knew just as  well when he made that assertion   that it was false as I know. Our pop-  ulation is only about 140 000. Mr.   Conyer, who had lived here some   six years, stated "that there were  40,000 scholars in the mission, and  he wanted assistance to furnish his   enlarged s[c]hool." Well, now you  take 40,000 scholars out of the   total populationof 140,000, and I do   not think you will leave many for   the Mormons. But all this is as   near true as anything you get abroad,  and I really wish that gentlemen,   clergymen and everybody else who  attempts to report Utah would tell   the truth. That is all we ask of any  persons who visit us. But it seems   impossible for anybody to speak of  Utah and the Latter-day Saints—  "Mormons" as they are termed—  with any degree of truth; but I wish  they would, it would be better for  them, better for us, and they would  be under less condemnation.    Now what are the principles in   which the Latter-day Saints believe?   What is the dreadful crime that we  have been guilty of for the last fifty  years? Why, the Lord has raised up  a Prophet—Joseph Smith. He sent  an angel from heaven in f[u]lfilment  of the revelations of St. John. [##Revelation 14:6##]   And that angel delivered   the gospel to Joseph Smith,   delivered unto him power and   knowledge to obtain the Book of  Mormon, a record containing the   history of the ancient inhabitants of  this continent who dwelt here hun-  dreds and thousands of years ago.    He translated it into the English   language. Does the Book of Mor-  mon contain a different gospel to   that contained in the Bible? It does  not. It gives a history of the people  who dwelt upon this continent  anciently, tells where they came   from and how they came here, tells   of the dealings of God with them,  and the establishment of the Church  of Christ among them. They were   visited by Jesus after His ressurrec-  tion. Hence He said "Other sheep   I have, which are not of this fold:  them also I must bring and they   shall hear my voice; and there shall  be one fold and one shepherd." [##John 10:16##] He   also told the Nephites when He   established His church among them  that He had other sheep. They  were the ten tribes of Israel.   The Book of Mormon is a history of  the dealings of God with that people;   the Bible is a history of the dealings of   God with Judah and with the Jews   and the twelve tribes of Israel: it  contains in fact a short outline of the   dealings of God with the Jaradites   and Nephites from the building of   the Tower of Babel down to the   days of the Savior and after His   resurrection. The Bible is the Stick   of Judah in the hands of Judah,  and the Book of Mormon the Stick  of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim. [##Ezekiel 37:16-20##]   Both books contain the same gospel.    There was never but one gospel and   there never will be any other reveal-  ed to the human family. Hence  Paul says: "Though we, or an angel  from heaven, preach any other gos-  pel unto you than that which   we have preached unto you,   let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] Now,   if Joseph Smith had establish-  ed any other gospel on the earth  than the gospel that Paul taught,  that Christ and His Apostles taught,   and that was taught to Abraham,   Noah and the antediluvian world,   why we would have the curse of God  resting upon us. The great trouble   with the so-called Christian world   is that they have spiritualized the   scriptures until there is not a sem-  blance of the gospel left. I never   could find it. I never could hear a   gospel sermon in my life, and I sat  under Dr. Porter and Dr. Hawes and   other great divines of the day. I   never could hear a gospel sermon ac-  cording to the ancient pattern as  was taught by Joseph Smith. Of   course all sects have had some   truth. All sects have professed to   believe in the blood of Jesus Christ,   more or less; all sects and parties  have their various roads to heaven  and to hell, but none of them teach   the gospel according to the pattern  laid down in the New Testament.    It required an angel from heaven  "to fly in the midst of heaven, hav-  ing the everlasting gospel to preach  unto them that dwell on the earth,   and to every nation, and kindred,   and tongue and people," to prepare   them for the great judgments of our   God before the winding up scene. [##Revelation 14:6##]   That angel has come: that gospel  has been delivered. It was delivered  to Joseph Smith. He did not re-  ceive his power from man, but from   the revelations of Jesus Christ.   What did that gospel teach? Why,   faith in Jesus Christ. "Yes, oh   yes," say the Methodist, "we believe  in Jesus Christ." All right. Then  the next principle was repentance of   our sins. "But," say the sectarian   "world, "we also believe in repent-  ance." Well, what is next? The   revivalists who visited this city   (Messrs. Sankey & Moody) believed   in Jesus Christ, and they said that if   a person only came to Christ, he did   not require to be a Methodist, Bap-  tist, Mormon, or a[n]ything else. Pro-  phets and Apostles were not requir-  ed; all that was required was to   come to Christ. But we say there is   something more required besides be-  lieving. [Every] man has to be baptized   for the remission of his sins in order   to enter into the kingdom of heaven.   That law of baptism has never been   altered. Many believe in baptism   even by immersion, but not par-  ticularly for remission of sins.    What next? Having repented of  our sins and been baptized for a re-  mission of them, we must have  hands laid upon for the reception of  the Holy Ghost, and when we have  received the Holy Ghost it will be  unto us a principle of revelation, a   testimony of the Father and of the   Son.    Well, what kind of a church are  you going to have? Paul, in speak-  ing of the Corinthians, goes on to   represent the Church of Christ to   the body of a man. He shows that   every part of the body must act in   unison; the head, the eyes, the ears,   the mouth, the feet must all work  together in order that the body may  be perfect and that there be no   schism. We are also told that God   set in the Church Apostles, Pro-  phets, Evangelists, Pastors and   Teachers for the perfecting of the   Saints, for the work of the ministry,  for the edifying of the body of   Chr[i]st. Now, we have had indepen-  dence of mind enough to believe   this doctrine. This is "Mormon-  ism." It is faith in Christ, repen-  tence of our sins, baptism for the  remission of our sins, and the re-  ception of the Holy Ghost by the  laying on of hands. These are the   principles which we as Latter-day   Saints believe in. We do not believe  that God ever had a church on the   earth without Apostles and Pro-  phets in it, without inspiration in it.    To do away with any of the princi-  ples of the gospel would cause a   schism in the Church of Christ.   When you cut the head off a man   he will die. He may live if he loses   an arm or a leg, but if you cut the   head off he will die. Precisely so   with the Church of Christ. We   believe in the Bible; we believe in  all the prophecies; we believe God  meant just what He said and said  just what he meant; we believe that  the prophecies of the scriptures are  of no private interpretation; we be-  lieve in the second coming of Christ;   we believe that the judgments of   Almighty God will be poured out   upon this generation. All the un-  belief of the world will not stay the  f[u]lfilment of the decrees of the Al-  mighty. The unbelief of the in-  habitants of the antedeluvian world   in the days of Noah did not stay   the deluge. The unbelief of the   inhabitants of Sodom Gomorrah did   not avert the destruction of   th[e]se cities. The unbelief  of the Jews did not avert  the destruction of Jerusalem.   We look for a literal fulfilment of   the decrees of God. We know as a  people that He has set His hand to  establish His Church. He has set  His hand to warn all nations. The  Holy Priesthood has been restored,  not by the power of man, but by   the power of Almighty God.    As I have said, we believe in the   [B]ook of Mormon as containing a re-  cord of the ancient inhabitants of   this continent, and a clue to the   ruins which have been discovered  in various parts of the land and for   which the world can find no origin.    The whole history of these things,   however, is pointed out in the Book   of Mormon, and if the world would  only take the trouble to read that   book they would understand these   things perfectly. The American  Indians are a remnant of the an-  cient inhabitants of this continent.   Their forefathers were an enlight-  ened people. They had the gospel  among them and the power of God   was manifested in their midst; but   when they became wicked and turn-  ed away from God, the jugdments   of the Almighty fell upon them and   they were overthrown and destroy-  ed by warfares. The Lamanites,   now a downtrodden people, are a   remnant of the house of Israel. The  curse of God has followed them as it   has done the Jews, though the Jews   have not been darkened in their   skin as have the Lamanites. The   fate of the Jews in this respect is a   standing monument to all infidel-  ity. The prediction of Jesus with   regard to them has been literaliy   fulfilled. He predicted that they   should be led away captive unto all   nations, and that Jerusalem should  be trodden down of the Gentiles, un-  til the times of the Gentiles be ful-  filled. When Pilate was ready to  release Jesus because he found no  fault in him, the Pharisees and High   Priests, being filled with prejudice,   would not have it. They cried out   "Crucify him, crucify him, and let   his blood be upon us and our chil-  dren." [##Luke 23:21##] [##Matthew 27:25##] The prediction of Jesus has  been verified, and its fulfilment is   before the world to-day. The Jews   have been trampled under the feet  of the Gentiles for 1800 years, and  they are to-day being persecuted in  European nations. Why? Because  that curse of God rests upon them   and will rest upon them until  Shiloh comes, until they are   re-gathered to Jerusalem and rebuild  the city in unbelief. You cannot   convert a Jew. They will never be-  lieve in Jesus Christ until He comes  to them in Jerusalem, until these   fleeing Jews take back their gold  and silver to Jerusalem and rebuild   their city and temple, and they will   do this as the Lord lives. Then the   gentiles will say, "Come let us go   up to Jerusalem; let us go up and  spoil her. The Jews have taken our  gold and silver from the nations of  the earth—come let us go up and  fight against Jerusalem." Then will  the prophecies that are before you be  fulfilled. The gospel was preached  first to the Jews and then to the gen-  tiles. The Jews rejected the mes-  sage: the gentiles received it, and  unto them was given all the gifs and   blessings of the gospel. But Paul   told them to take heed lest they fell  through the same example of unbe-  lief. [##1 Corinthians 10:12##] Yet in time, we gentiles, de-  parted from the kingdom of God,  and the church went into the wil-  derness. There has not been an or-  ganization of the church of Christ   on the earth from the days of the   ancient Apostles, until the days of  Joseph Smith, who came forth in  this great and last dispensation, and  who by inspiration and power from  on high again restored the gospel.   The world do not believe this. We  cannot help that. The unbelief of   the world does not make the work of   the Lord of non-effect. The Lord   has set his hand to establish his   church and kingdom, and the warn-  ing voice is to all men. He has call-  ed his servants to bear record of this  to all nations. This is what the   Lord is doing with these dispised   Mormons. And already the mem-  bers of nearly every sect under  heaven have embraced this work,   though our numbers are small com-  pared with the christian world. We   expect this. As it was in the days   of Noah and Lot, so shall it be at  the coming of the Son of Man.   These principles are true. The world  does not know what awaits them no  more than they did in the days of  Noah, or in the days of the Jews.    But, why this furore against the  Latter-day Saints? Do you know?    "Oh, yes, we do. You are Poly-  gamists. That is what is the mat-  ter." Well, indeed! Now, let me  as you a question. Were we Poly-  gamists when we were driven   from Jackson and Clay Counties?    Why, the worst persecution we have  ever had, was before Polygamy was   revealed to us, or before we received   it. What cause, then, had the Mis-  sourians and others to drive us in   the beginning? "Oh, you believe in  revelation, you believe in prophets;  we cannot bear these things,   they are all done away with.   These things were only given  in the dark ages of the world,  but to-day, living as we are in the   blaze of the glorious gospel, we do  not need them; but if you will be-  lieve as we do and scatter yourselves  abroad among the Methodists, etc.,   and do as they do, it will be all   right." Now, gentlemen. it is not   polygamy. What do you care about  polygamy? What does our nation   care about polygamy? What do the  sectarians care about polygamy?  Bless your souls, nothing. But nine   per cent. of these Mormons may be   polygamists. Dreadful! Why, have  you no evils in New York? Have  you no evils in Boston? Have you  no evils anywhere? Are you all   perfect? If so, you are pretty well   off; you are certainly prepared for  salvation. But no, my friends, I   will tell you: If we were to give up   polygamy to-day—if we were to say    to our government, "Oh, yes, we  will give up polygamy"—why the   next thing they would say would be,  But look here; you have got to give   up something more than that."   They would tell us, as the Missou-  ians did, that we must quit believ-  in prophets, apostles and revelation.  The same feeling exists to-day as   existed then.    We Latter-day Saints are called   out of the world. We have received  the gospel of Jesus Christ. The   Lord Almighty  has raised up pro-  phets and apostles in this our day,   and has set His hand to establish   the kingdom that Daniel saw in ful-  filment of revelation and prophecy.  [##Daniel 2:26-47##]  We have been gathered out from   the nations of the earth to these  valleys of the mountains. Zion is   growing and increasing. This has  bean the ca[s]e from the beginning.  There has never been an hour from   the organization of this Church but   what our course has been onward  and upward, Even in the midst of   mud and water, on the banks of the  Missouri River, where, by an edict  of Governor Boggs, some 10,000 were  driven—no matter under what cir-  cumstances we have been placed,  the hand of God has been over us.    The Almighty has set His hand to   gather in the meek of the earth.   And after our testimony, will come  the testimony of thunderings and   lightnings. Read the revelations of   St. John; see the signs of the   times, and prepare yourselves for  that which is to come. We trust  in God. We cannot afford to deny  the Lord, we cannot deny his reve-  lations. We have a code of revela-  tions called the Doctrine and Cove-  nants. That code, given through   the mouth of Joseph Smith, con-  tains the most sublime revela-  tions concerning this genera-  tion that were ever given to the   world. Many of these revelations  have had their fulfilment so far as  time has permitted. Joseph Smith   was a true prophet of God. I tra-  velled thousands of miles with him;   in fact the revelation he gave con-  cerning the war that would break   out between the North and South, I  wrote that revelation myself as it   was given by the Prophet 20 years  before it was fulfilled. That revela-  tion was published to the world  broadcast, and I merely refer to it  because it is a thing that is clear to   the minds of all men. All the reve-  lations in the Book of Doctrine and   Covenants, the Bible, and the Book   of Mormon will have their fulfil-  ment in the earth.    We are living in an important day.    We are living in the most important  dispensation God ever gave to man.   There is a great change awaiting us;   there is a great change awaiting Zion,   our Government, and the 
 Juab Stake Conference.  NEPHI, Juab County, U. T.,  January 21st, 1884.    Apostle Wilford Woodruff addressed   the congregation for the remainder of  the time. It was very pleasing to lis-  ten to the whole of the discourse. He   said there is a good people living here.  When he looked upon the great work  it required to build up Zion he felt that   we fell far short of what we ought to  be. He was not surprised that the   devil is mad, or that the world are  against us. He and his followers al-  ways oppose the truth. They call upon   us to give up our religion. What a   strange position we should be in; we  should have the devil and all the world  for our friends. But God and all the   heavenly hosts would be against us.    We cannot do this. Our nation has a   constitution, and it was made for us   just as much as it was for any other   religious denomination, and if they   trample it under their feet they will be  destroyed. We have a right to serve   God and we are going to do it.    In the evening a priesthood meeting   was held and largely attended. The  presidents of the several quorums  gave very cheering reports of the faith-  fulness of the brethren of this stake.    Bishop William H. Warner reported  that the deacons, mostly, had hauled  about 50 loads of wood for the poor  and our meeting house, and they made  it a practice of turning out in quorums  and chopping the wood up. Apostle  Wilford Woodruff said during his re-  marks at this meeting that this was the  first time that he had ever heard that  the deacon's quorums had ever magni-  fied their calling. He also said that all  those who had been ordained to the  Priesthood were expected to magnify  their callings or they would be con-  demned.    On Sunday morning a Stake Confer-  ence was held for the Sabbath Schools.   Our meeting house was crowded with  children and teachers. The Sabbath  Schools were reported in a flourishing  condition. Apostles Woodruff and  Teasdale addressed the children. The  Stake Conference convened in the  afternoon, when the General and Local  authorities of the Church were pre-  sented and sustained. James Latimor  and Christian E. Nielson were appoint-  ed to fill vacancies, the first in the High  Council and the latter as Counselor to  Bishop Haws of Mona.    President Woodruff occupied the re-  mainder of the time. He read from   the 122 Section of the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants, after which he related

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  MILLENIAL STAR.    "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word  it is because there is no light in them."—ISAIAH viii, 20.    No. 28, Vol. L Monday, July 9, 1888. Price One Penny    FUNERAL SERVICES OF APOSTLE ERASTUS SNOW.    -[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 421.]-    Apostle Heber J. Grant said: I am  pleased to add my testimony regard-  ing Brother Erastus Snow. I know  of no man who has labored more  faithfully and energetically. None  were too insignificant for his notice.  He took an interest in all. There is  no man whose life is a better example  for the youth of Israel. My ideal of  an apostle was Erastus Snow. When  I was called as an apostle I prayed  that the same spirit of self-sacrifice  might inspire me. No man can say  anything but good of him. He has  been a Latter-day Saint in very deed,  and has gained an exaltation in the  celestial kingdom of God. It was in-  tended to read the last sermon he  delivered, at a young men's meeting,  April 8, 1888, but there is not time.  He then said: "The Lord keeps His  own counsels in these things, and it  is not given to us to know and under-  stand the day and the hour when the  Son of Man will come; but it is for  us always to be prepared, and to so  live that we shall be prepared for Him  when He does come. And whether  we lay down our bodies before the  coming of the Son of Man or not it   mattereth not, so that we have filled  our days with usefulness, are prepared   to come forth when the trump shall  sound and call forth the dead. I do  most heartily endorse those senti-  ments which have been expressed  concerning the dead who die in the  Lord. They do not taste of death.  It seems to me that there is no death,  but they are moving on to life—life  eternal." Brother Erastus is moving  on to life eternal, and may we follow  in his footsteps.    I am requested to read a few words  written by Apostle Moses Thatcher.    Erastus Snow is dead! How few,  even among Latter-day Saints—how  few, indeed, of his immediate associ-  ates—comprehended his worth, or  fully appreciated his generous, un-  selfish disposition.    He was great because [he was] good. An  intellectual giant, yet humble as a  child. Now, and in years to come, as  questions of magnitude affecting the  public weal arise, the void caused by  his departure will seem fathomless, as  the grief at his loss will be intense.  As the load he carried without a mur-  mur settles upon others already heavi-

 many incidents in the life of the Pro-  phet Joseph Smith and the History of   the Church.    In the evening Apostle Teasdale oc-  cupied the most of the time, his sub-  ject being baptism for the dead. Apos-  tle Woodruff followed upon the same   subject, and urged upon the Saints the  great necessity for them to live so that   their labors may be acceptable for the   redemption of their dead.

The section  is as follows:    "The vail was taken from our minds, and the  eyes of our understanding were opened.  We saw the Lord standing on the breastwork  of the pulpit, before us, and under his feet was  a paved work of pure gold in color like amber.  His eyes were as a flame of fire, the hair  of his head was white like the pure snow, his  countenance shone above the brightness of the  sun, and his voice was as the sound of  the rushing ^of^ great waters, even the voice of Jehovah,    saying—  I am the first and the last, I am he who  liveth, I am he who was slain, I am your  advocate with the Father.

My father is  aged and not able to  work. All his help (consisting  of my two younger brothers)  is away from home attend-  ing the same college from   which I graduated.

 ly burdened with accumulated respon-  sibilities, how vividly will they sense  the taking away of one ever ready—  always willing to put a lifting shoulder  to the wheel. In the future, when  dark clouds of persecution are riven  by the fierce lightnings of hate, and  wrathful storms beat upon defenseless  heads, who can fill the place of Erastus  Snow? In times of peace, when the  allurements of a deceitful ease threa-  tened danger in the path of unsus-  pecting youth, who will be able to  supplement the wise counsel that hath  laid the foundation for many a pros-  perous, pure, and patient life? To  whom now can the young go for a  chart to guide them over life's troubled  sea, with the same confident assurance  that they have experienced in going  to him?    Into what listening ear and sym-  pathetic heart shall the troubled now  pour their story of distress? Who  now will console the forsaken or com-  fort the grief-striken, as he has done?  The poor came to him freely, and the  sick and weary laid their burdens  upon his shoulders without hestiation.  Who will bear them now?    As the knowledge that Erastus  Snow is dead settles into the feelings  of the people, the fountains of emo-  tion will break forth, and silent tears  will moisten many a spot where for  hours he has stood patiently listening  to piteous tales, while incipient dis-  ease sowed the seeds of death in his  unshrinking body; for when the sor-  rows of others overshadowed him,  Erastus Snow was wholly oblivious of  self.    Heedless of consequences, he has   stood for hours exposed to the night  winds of a Southern desolation, more  treacherous than the snows and frosts  of a Northern clime. While thus   exposed, thoughtless persons have  poured into his sympathetic ears tales  of troubles as if his compassionate  heart could never fail to respond.    But now he is dead, and the drafts  of friends and the demands of enemies  must each go to protest. His mortal  career is ended. For the cause of his  taking away we must search amid the  burning sands and gleaming volcanic  rocks of Southern Utah, where has  been spent the best years of his life.  Many a weary night he had sought  repose while exhausted nature—sweat-  ing at every pore—was chilled by the  winds sweeping the cactus plains of  Mexico or sighing through the pines  of the Sierra Madre. To those who,  in their misguided enforcement of the  law, have deprived him of the conso-  lation and comforts of home, what  shall the harvest be? Under trying  circumstances he recently endured a   severe operation upon his eyes. Ex-  hausted by the pain inflicted, and  while trying to rest in a room and bed   to which he was unused, he contracted  a severe cold that resulted in his  death.    Not long since a brother in deep  affliction exclaimed, "I would give  more this moment to see Erastus  Snow than any man living, for he  could tell me what to do in this hour  of supreme trial."    Measure his life's work, and how  beautiful and perfect in every part it  now in the presence of death seems.  As husband and father, tender and  true, affectionate and just. As friend  and brother, devoted and unchange-  able. As statesman and scholar, pro-  found and farseeing. As defender of  constitutional liberty, valiant and con-  sistent. As a servant of God, faith-  ful, devoted, true. Magnanimous to  enemies, generous to friends. Un-  swerving in life, trusting and confident  in death. Such was Erastus Snow.  Let the fingers of fame weave garlands  with which to entwine the brow of  battle-begrimmed heroes! Let ambi-  tion sing from monumental piles the   praises of those who in life wrought   carnage and death; but for us, we  will keep fresh in our hearts the  memory of the good and true whose  mission was devoted to life, not death.    He has left us to join those gone  before. Let us emulate his works,  follow his example, and when thrones  shall totter and kingdoms fall, joy-  fully in his mansion home shall greet  him "wives, children, and friends."    Apostle John Henry Smith said:  It seems almost impossible for me to  sufficiently control my feelings to  speak to you. The name of Erastus  Snow has been familiar to me from my  earliest remembrance. It has been  my privilege to live in his home and

 whole Christian world. The signs  [of] the times indicate the coming of   [the] Son of Man in power and great   [glo]ry. But before His coming the   [go]spel has got to be preached to all  [n]ations. We have been preaching  [th]e gospel for 50 years, and by it a   [illegible] have gathered out from the na-  [tio]ns of the earth to these valleys of  [the] mountains. That is why the   [wo]rld hate us. It is because the   [Lo]rd has called us out of the world   [to] establish the everlasting gospel.  [An]d I want to say to the Latter-day   [Sai]nts: Have faith in the revela-  tions of God; have faith in the pro-  [m]ises that have been given. We  [sh]ould be preparing ourselves for the  [gre]at events that swait us. Dark-  [ne]ss covers the earth and gross  [da]rkness the people. The Lord is  [wit]hdrawing His Spirit from the  [na]tions of the earth, and the power  [of] the devil is gaining dominion   [ov]er the children of men. See how  [t]ime is increasing. Fifty years ago   [wh]en the Book of Mormon was   [tr]anslated by Joseph Smith there   [w]as not one murder where there   [ar]e a thousand to-day; there   [wa]s not one whoredom where  [th]ere are a thousand to-day;  [an]d so you may go through the   [wh]ole black catalogue of crime.    Whatsoever a man soweth, that   [sha]ll he also reap." "With what   [me]asure ye mete, it shall be mea-  [sur]ed to you." Look at the wicked-  [ness] that is on the increase in the  [wo]rld, covering the earth like the   [wat]ers of the great deep. What will   [the] end be? Death, destruction,   [whirl]winds, pestilence, famine and  [ the ju]dgments of God will be poured   [ou]t upon the wicked; for the Lord  [has] withheld these judgments until  [the] world is fully warned. To this   [end] we have been laboring diligent-  ly for 50 years, so far as we have had  [oppo]rtunity. But all these judg-  [me]nts will come. The seals will be  [open]ed; plague will follow plague;  [the] sun and the moon will be dark-  [en]ed; and the unbelief of the world   [wil]l make no difference to all these   [thi]ngs coming to pass.    I have a desire with you, as Lat-  [ter]-day Saints, that we may keep   [the] faith, overcome the world and   [mag]nify our high and holy callings.    [We] will be held responsible before  [the] Lord for the light we possess.  [We] should be diligent and faithful   [in] our labors, for if we turn our backs   [o]n the truth, once having known   [it] we will be under far greater con-  [de]mnation than those who rejected   [th]e truth. What we may be called   [u]pon to suffer for the gospel's sake is   [n]either here nor there. This nation   and every other nation is in the   hands of God. Your destiny is in  the hands of God. Men can go no   [fu]rther than the Lord will permit  [the]m to go. But we should be faith-  [ful] to God and to our fellowmen,   [be] ready to do what is required of    [m]y God our Heavenly Father  His blessing may be over us;   the hearts of the people of our   [own] and other nations may be   to the light of the gospel, that  [illegible] may not pursue the course   [the] Jews did, for we know what it   [cos]t them. It will cost this na-  [tio]n or any other nation the same to  [illegible] the blood of the servants of   God. Whatever course a nation  [goes] in this respect, it will have  [illegible]t the bill. The constition of  [this] country is one of the best that  was ever given to any government.   [Our] forefathers were inspired of God   [to] write that instrument. I have a  [respect] for our government, flag and   [cons]titution. I know this nation   [has] been raised up by the power of  God for a certain purpose, and that to   [est]ablish his kingdom upon it,  [in]asmuch as we do our duty the  [Lord] will sustain us. Those that   [wish] to establish the kingdom of   [God] in the earth will be blessed,   [and] those that fight against the   [illegible] of God will be held responsible   [for] their actions.    [I] feel to bear my testimony to the   [truth] of this work. I know Joseph   [Smi]th was a prophet of God, and I  [have] a desire that I may be faithful   [with] the rest of my brethren that I   [may] inherit eternal life, for Jesus   [Chri]st sake. Amen.

 associate with him and his family. It  has also been my privilege to mingle  with him in councils, and in such  places as try men's souls. I have   never known him for one moment to  doubt or hesitate in regard to the work  God had imposed upon him. In his  home, gentle and affectionate; pru-  dent in his exmple; consistent and  wise in his language; loving and kind,  and as just as God has made mortal  man. In traveling with him I have  often wondered at the inspiration  which guided him, especially in talk-  ing to the young. His words of coun-  sel fell in the kindest accents; his  rebukes were administered in fearless-  ness, and were followed by kindess.  He possessed a judicial mind, and had  he followed the profession of the law  none would have excelled him for the  greatness of his decisions. God was  with him. I have seen His power  manifest in him. Brother Erastus  has worthily performed the labors of  an apostle. He was among the fore-  most in toil, usually working till the  early hours of the morning. When it  was found necessary to settle the de-  sert soil of Southern Utah, Erastus  Snow was called, and faltered not in  the midst of difficulty. Frequently,  when his body was racked with pain,  he would go into the fields and coun-  sel with the people. He was also  father of the settlements in Arizona.  There is no tribute that is not due to  Erastus Snow. As a preacher of the  Gospel, he was eloquent; as a colon-  izer, true; as a legislator, wise; as a  councilor, fearless; as a friend, un-  swerving; as a father, unexcelled in  love and integrity. I have looked   upon him as one of the brightest of  earth's sons, and, had he remained in  his native State, he would have shone  in the councils of the nation. May   the blessings of heaven rest on his  numerous family, and may we say of   them, they were worthy descendants  of a noble sire, who was devoted to  the work of God.    Apostle Smith then read the fol-  lowing letter from President Wilford  Woodruff:    Beloved Brethren and Sisters,  Once again, in the providences of the  Almighty, Israel mourns the loss of  one of its mightiest sons. Death sel-  dom comes at a time we deem oppor-  tune; and if we, in our blindess,  were permitted to judge, we should  certainly decide that the present, with  its trials, its perplexities, and its sor-  rows, is no time to take from our   midst men of counsel, of wisdom, of  faith, and of judgment, such as was   our beloved brother, Elder Erastus  Snow, whose obsequies we this day  solemnize. But He who doeth all  things well has been pleased to take  to Himself His servant, and we can  simply bow the head and acknowledge  His hand in all things, and with one  of old exclaim: "The Lord giveth,  and the Lord taketh away; blessed  be the name of the Lord."    The peculiarities of our position  prevent us from personally joining  with you in this tribute of respect to  our departed, and now sanctified,  brother, whose departure from this  mortal sphere has doubtless been  hastened by the same causes that pre-  vent us from joining you on this sad  occasion. This enforced absence we  sincerely regret, as we should have  found a mournful satisfaction in add-  ing our testimony to that of our  brethren, touching the virtues, the in-  tegrity, the zeal, the whole-hearted-  ness, of our friend and co-labourer  who has passed before us into the  joys of eternity. For him we have   no cause to mourn; he has fought the  good fight, he has finished his work,  he has been true and faithful, and is  now entering into that fairer and  better world, the bliss of which the  heart cannot conceive nor the natural   eye see, but the glories of which, by   reason of his obedience and devotion  to God and His laws, had been sealed  upon him through sacred ordinances  and by the Holy Spirit of Promise  while he yet tabernacled in mortality.  May our end be like his.    The name of Erastus Snow will  never be forgotten in the history of  the Church of Christ. From early  youth to his latest day he was ever  found in the unflinching performance  of his duties as a servant of the Most  High. Without exaggeration it can  be said of him that he died with the  harness on. In every position he was  called to fill—and they were many—  he exhibited those nobler traits which

Toronto,    44 Dewson St  December 9th    Dear Sir    Would you be kind enough to tell me  whether the enclosed bill is still redeemable  at par value, or if not whether it would be  of value as a relic of early days with your people.   A wallet containing bills of this description was  among the papers belonging to my dear husband,   who got the wallet as it stands from his father  James Cummings who was Collector of Customs  at Chippawa on the Niagara frontier for a very  great many years, and who I have always  understood, found it among some articles that were  seized in the customs.    The signatures are the same on all.   Since my husbands death three years ago I have  had to support myself & my child, as a journalist,   and so, needing money I venture to ask a prompt  answer to my questions.    Very Sincerely Yours  (Mrs) Emily Cummings

 6    the world. Not but what there have been various  communications, as in this case, in speaking of the  "Gospel of Abraham"; but we find this manifestation   in most of all the ministrations of the Aaronic  or Levitical Priesthood, and this very strongly manifest  with John the Baptist, who was the last personage  who held, as it were, the Aaronic Priesthood on the  earth at the coming of the Messiah. Of course the  history of this we are all acquainted with. John  the Baptist had power to administer in the ordinances  of the Gospel as far as the Levitical or Aaronic  Priesthood was concerned, and this priesthood, we  see was given to the house of Israel, while  the Melchesedec Priesthood, and the Gospel of  Christ, the fulness of that gospel, was taken  from them ^in the days of^^in the days of Moses^. This state of things continued,  more or less, until the days of John. And there  was one peculiar event in regard to John the

 dignify the character of a Saint. If  we view him as a missionary of the  Gospel of peace, as a legislator for the  people of God, as a pioneer, convert-  ing the wilderness into the fruitful  field, as an apostle in the councils  of the Church, we everywhere find  him a man of no ordinary type, but  one whose ability and strength of  character marked him as a leader  among men, even where great men  were not lacking. It would be diffi-  cult for us to pick out any one special  department of life and say in this he  most particularly shone, or select  some other and assert in that he was  most eminent. He was great in all.    To the sons and daughters of Scan-  dinavia he was perhaps greater as a  missionary—the first apostle who bore  the glad tidings of the Gospel to their  fatherland. To the weary toiler be-  neath the sultry sun of Southern Utah  he was best known as the indefatig-  able leader, who planned, devised, con-  trived and arranged for their progress  and made prosperity possible in one of  the most arid, most forbidding regions  of this great continent. His prudence,  his wisdom, his foresight, are admitted  by all—as a counselor he had few  peers. His ripe experience, joined  with his sound judgment, gave a  weight to his words and a strength to  his counsels that all who heard felt.  Moreover, he possessed, unclouded by  stain, those two great virtues that  give a man power with the heavens—  integrity and purity of character. Let  a man possess these, let his heart be  true and unflinching, let his life be  pure, and, if we add to these humility,  he is proof against a multitude of  weaknesses and can resist a host of  temptations. We all have our weak-  nesses; God has permitted them that  we might be taught humility in our-  selves and charity towards others.    We none of us are perfect whilst we  dwell in the flesh; but the man who  in humble reliance upon God never  falters in the fight for the right, never  wavers in his allegiance to the truth,  and ever maintains inviolate his  covenants, is one whom we can all  pause to admire, and strive, by  heaven's help, to imitate. Such men  are few when compared with the un-  numbered hosts who have peopled  this earth of ours; but we thank God  that we do find them more abundantly   in the midst of the Saints, holding  the Holy Priesthood and ministering  in things the most sacred ever be-  stowed upon humanity. Among these,  in the front ranks, is our esteemed  brother whose mortal remains are  about to be consigned to the tomb.    For nearly forty years Brother Snow  has been one of the twelve apostles  of the Lord Jesus. To this calling he  has given the strength of his prime  and the wisdom of his later years. It   has been during this period that he  has performed a very large portion of  his missionary, legislative and pioneer  services. We shall sadly miss him in  the quorum with which he has been so  long identified, and of which he was  at the time of his death one of the  oldest members. We shall miss his  mature consideration, his deliberate  thoughts, his experienced advice—all  most needful at a time when the  powers of evil are assailing us in so  many directions. But we thank the  Lord that though from time to time  He takes from us those who, as men,  we trust most fondly, yet He leaves  us not entirely to ourselves, but con-  tinues unto us the signs of His ap-  proval. We are comforted with the   assurance that this is His kingdom,  and that He rules in the heavens and  upon the earth; and that from the  fall of a sparrow to the death of an  apostle all is known unto Him, and  nothing happens without His sanction.    And further, brethren and sisters,  are we not the sons and daughters of  God, and when he shall appear, if we  are faithful, shall we not be like him?  Yes; and when the glorious day ar-  rives we shall once more have the  privilege of standing upon this earth  and meeting in joy and thanksgiving,  not only our brother who has just left  us, but Joseph and Brigham, and  thousands of others who have washed  their robes white in the blood of the  Lamb, and who, through the merits  of His atonement, are anointed kings  and priests unto God, and with Him  reign exalted in His kingdom. May  we all be found worthy of this reward;  and now, while we travel through this  world of change and sorrow, may we  take pattern by the lives of the

 7    Baptist, and that was the baptising of the Messiah,  which I think is a very strong argument, should be with  all men who have any faith with regard to the Gospel  of Jesus Christ or the ordinances of Salvation. Jesus  came to John to be baptised in Jordan. John said   to him, "I have need to be baptised of thee, and  comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said  unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh  us to fulfil all righteousness." I do not know of  a stronger argument or testimony on all the  revelations of God that should be more convincing  to the human family with regard to this ordinance,  that it is necessary to the salvation of the children  of men, than in this instance. I do not say  that the Saviour was baptised for the remission  of sins, I do not know that he ever committed  any, I have no testimony that he ever did,  for his calling ^&^ his position was altogether

But baptising by immersion in water was  an ordinance which belonged to the Gospel of Jesus Christ,  and no man can reject this without he rejects the  testimony of the Prophets and Apostles and the  Gospel of Salvation; no man can receive the Gospel  of life and salvation without it, and unless a man  is better than Jesus Christ was, unless he has a   higher calling and office than the Son of God had, he  has no excuse on the face of the earth to reject  baptism as one of the ordinances of the house  of God, for it is a rightous ordinance, it is a  commandment of the Father, and the Saviour ful-  filled that law to set the example to those who followed  him and to the inhabitants of the earth.
