He went to that country under the counsel of President Brigham  Young and he has done the best he could to carry out his counsel. I think when the committee had once settled with him they ought to let him alone and not continue to annoy him, and the committee ought to let him have the branding iron that his cattle are branded with.   would like you Brother Udall to do what you can to see that the settlement with Lot is upon a fair basis.

The rapid transit of passen- gers in trains from one place to an- other makes it very inconvenient for passengers going either east or west,  and the changes are so rapid that it  renders their time pieces compara- tively useless. The railroads and tel- egraph lines especially have found it necessary to adopt a time or times of their own to suit their own conveni- ences, and to comply as far as practi- cable with the local meridian time of the several districts of country through which they pass. In some  cities it made it extremely difficult  both for the passengers and also for  the railroads, as well as for the inhab- itants of the city, who desired to trav- el as, frequently there would be from two to six different times in the same city adopted by the railroads passing through in different directions; and  as there is so great an amount of travel, it became very annoying, not only to travelers but to parties resid- ing in those cities who were more or  less controlled by those circumstan- ces.   posed and theories introduced to cor- rect this evil, principally, at first, in  the interest of railroads and telegraph lines, all of which proposals, until quite recently, have been rejected as tending to confusion. But at length a plan was proposed to be introduced to regulate the time of the whole of  the territory to the United States, and  to have all the cities and towns em- braced in the several States and Ter- ritories conform to a general regula- tion on the subject, so that difficul- ties which were very perplexing and annoying might be avoided, both in regard to railroad travel and also to  the inhabitants of cities. The plan  proposed is to make four dif- ferent divisions of time, named the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific divisions, extending from the  extreme east to the extreme west,  varying in some slight degree from direct lines north and south to meet circumstances and to avoid confusion;  leaving it, of course, as an open ques- tion to the local authorities of the  States, Territories, municipalities, and districts to adjust these matters agree- ably to their own feelings, and sub- ject more or less, to their action.  This state of things reduces the dif- ficulty to a minimum of variation which was thought at one time impos- sible to accomplish, and the change from one division to another is al- ways exactly of one hour, without any perplexing odd minutes or sec- onds.   plan, and the state of things that be- fore existed is that whereas before, there were more than fifty variations  of time in the United States, the pres- ent plan will reduce it to four, and if generally adopted it will prevent much confusion that has heretofore existed on this subject.   the cities of New York,  St.  Louis, Denver, and other prominent cities east have adopted the regulations, in accordance with  what is now called the "Standard  time" in contradistinction to local  time, and that the 75th, 90th, 105th,  and 120th meridian west of Green- wich have been selected as initial  points from which to calculate the time. Each of these points are 15 de- grees (or approximately 1,000 miles)  apart; and dividing this 1,000 into two, one slower and the other faster, no greater change than 30 or 35 min- utes can occur in the most extreme  points, while in many places there will be very slight variations from their local times or meridians.   or telegraphic change for the accom- plishment of their business transac- tions, it need not have effected the  local time of any of the cities or  towns of the United States or Terri- tories. But as it has been found that it would be beneficial to the general  interests of the whole nation, it be- comes necessary for us to calmly and intelligently investigate the subject,  and if found practicable, to comply therewith throughout our Territory,  in our various cities, towns, and vil- lages, that we may be in harmony  with the States and Territories  throughout the country.   be twenty-eight minutes faster in Salt Lake City than our meridian  time, and it would necessitate a simi- lar change to be made throughout  our whole Territory, and as our settle- ments extend several hundred miles  nearly north and south, it would  make very little difference in the  longitudinal or mean time of any of  them.   in the service of the United States Geological Survey, I believe, came here and were desirous of having an initial point for astronomical, electri- cal, geodetical and other scientific  purposes, which was decided to be in the Temple Block, and President Young, in accordance with their wish- es, caused a large square block of stone to be provided, whereon to place their instruments, and whence a base line was laid to regulate the United States  and other surveys. We have since   dent's Office for the computation of time, and a gentleman appointed who  was competent to take observations  and adjust our time on strictly scien- tific principles. From these obser- vations our city time has been regu- lated from that period to the present, and the correct time has been tele- graphed twice a week to the various  telegraphic stations in our Territory; and if thought proper to change to  what is called Standard time it will simply make the difference of adding twenty-eight minutes to our meridian time and thus place us in harmony  with the nation in regard to this pro- posed change, and that time once be- ing adjusted here can be telegraphed as heretofore to the whole of the Ter- ritory, and thus and same uniformity  prevail as has hitherto existed, and  all confusion be avoided, so that every part of the Territory will be governed  by the same time, and no confusion or trouble exist; besides it will place us in harmony with the United States in this contemplated improvement.   ready, through their Municipal Coun- cil, adopted the Mountain Standard time, and we recommend that the people of the Territory generally  adopt this time, and suggest that the county, city, and town officials throughout the Territory meet in  their several capacities at an early day  and pass measures to adopt what is called the "Mountain Standard" time, and then we can adjust our time as formerly by the Salt Lake meridian, adding the difference between that  and the Standard time, and having  this time, as heretofore, telegraphed  twice a week to the various telegraph  offices throughout the Territory,  which will avoid confusion and place us in harmony as to time with all parts of our Territory and also with  what is now termed the Standard  Time of the United States.   JOHN TAYLOR, GEO Q. CANNON, JOS. F. SMITH,  First Presidency of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. WILFORD WOODRUFF, In behalf of the Council of the Apos- tles. SALT LAKE CITY,  ENDENTRY    sels to the Saints.   ing:   express myself upon the present con- dition of Zion and its inhabitants. The history which we are making as Latter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil- ment of the revelations of God, as given through the mouths of Prophets and inspired men to the inhabitants of the earth in every dispensation when God has had an acknowledged people on the earth. The God of heaven, who created this earth and placed His children upon it, gave unto them a law whereby they might be exalted and saved in a kingdom of  glory. For there is a law given unto all kingdoms, and all things are governed by law throughout the whole universe. Whatever law any- one keeps he is preserved by that law, and he receives whatever re- ward that law guarantees unto him. It is the will of God that all His chil- dren should obey the highest law, that they may receive the highest glory that is ordained for all immor- tal beings. But God has given all His children an agency, to choose what law they will keep.   good and evil; God and the Devil. Whatever leads to good and to do good is of God. Whatever leads to evil and to do evil is of the Devil. God has labored from the creation of man to lead him to keep the celestial  law, that he may inherit a celestial  glory and partake of eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God to man: while the Devil, with all the fallen angels, has labored from the creation to lead man astray, to lead him down to the perdition of ungodly men, that he may have dominion over him.   and controlled the acts of all the chil- dren of men, and laid the foundation for all the history of the whole world for the last six thousand years, or from the creation of man. This power of the Devil, and of all the  fallen angels, who are represented to have been one-third part of all the hosts of heaven, who were cast down from heaven to earth, has been at war against God and His Christ, and against every Prophet and Apostle  and inspired man whom God has raised up, from the creation of the world to the present day. The first man, Adam, under the influence of the Devil, transgressed a law by which death came into the world. ##Genesis 3:1-6## God the Eternal Father gave His only begotten Son, as a great sacrifice, to shed His blood to redeem man from death. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. ##1 Corinthians 15:22##   ship, is represented as the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. The Father and Son have tabernacles, and they created man after their own image. But the Holy Ghost is a spirit and a witness and a testimony of the Father and the Son. This Holy Ghost and witness are promised unto all men who will obey the law of the Gospel, which God has re- vealed to the human family. This Holy Ghost rested upon Adam when he blessed his posterity in Adam- ondi-Ahman, three years previous to his death.   many of his sons the Holy Priest- hood, whereby they could administer in the ordinances of the Gospel of life and salvation. ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53## The Lord has raised up men in every dispensation, when He has had a people on earth unto whom He has given the Priest- hood, and all people have been  blessed when they have hearkened to the voice of the Lord. On the other hand, when the inhabitants of the earth have become wicked, and have transgressed the law of God, they have been chastised, and when they have become ripened in iniquity they have been cut off from the earth, as in the case of Lot, and "as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man." ##Matthew 24:37## The righteous were saved while the wicked were destroyed.   of the Lord with man has shown the benefits and blessings of obeying the Lord and keeping His command ments. The history of the dealings of the Lord with ancient Israel shows that He blessed the righteous and cursed the wicked and brought His judgments upon them. Whenever Israel hearkened to the teachings of Moses and the prophets, they pros- pered, and their enemies were a prey unto them. But when they depart- ed from the Lord and set up altars to Baal, and committed sin, the Lord forsook them, as in the case of Judah and Zede- kiah the King. ##Jeremiah 32:28-36## He forsook the Lord, and led the people astray. They were full of blood and murder and whoredom and all manner of abomi- nations, and the Lord warned them through His Prophets, Jere- miah and Ezekiel. These Prophets told the king and the people what judgements would come upon them, and the Lord said by Ezekiel unto the king and the people, "What I have spoken shall be done." ##Ezekiel 12:28## Now all that these Prophets said came to pass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un- fulfilled. The Jews put to death the Savior and the Apostles and rejected the Lord and the Gospel; and all that Moses, Jesus, the Apostles and the Prophets spoke concerning Israel, Judah and Jerusalem came to pass to the very letter.   have written since man was placed upon the earth have seen our day, and have prophesied of the events which were to take place on the earth in the last dispensation and fullness of times. They have seen the Church of God, the Zion of God, and the  Kingdom of God established on the earth, and the gathering of the peo- ple from all nations to build them up, and the judgments of God which were to rest, in the last days, upon all nations who should fight against Mount Zion and the people of God. Now, I wish to ask the Latter-day Saints if they can for a moment think that the Lord will fail in these days in fulfilling His promises any more than He has in other dispensations? No; He will not.   the mouths of those ancient Apostles and Prophets, the Lord has set His hand once more, for the last time, to prune His vineyard and to establish His Church and Kingdom upon the earth, to be thrown down no more forever. He has raised up His Pro- phets and Apostles and revealed unto them the fulness of the everlasting Gospel, and given unto them the everlasting priesthoods of Aaron and of Joseph Smith was raised up by the power of God, and the administration of angels, and he brought forth the Book of Mormon, the record and stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim, as spoken of by the Prophet Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 37:16-19|37th chap- ter##. This Prophet of God, Joseph Smith, had power to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the ancient or- der of the Church of Christ, with Apostles and Prophets, Evangelists, Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. And the Church has been led continually by living oracles and the revelations of God from Heaven until the present day. It has now stood fifty-six years since its organization, and its history is before the heavens and the earth. The Prophets and Apostles and many Elders have gone forth and preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ to many nations, and tens of thousands of the inhabitants of the earth have em- braced the Gospel, been baptized for the remission of their sins, have re- ceived the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and have been gathered home to Zion from many nations, in fulfillment of the ancient Prophets, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Earth and hell have been combined to stop the little stone from rolling, and from becom- ing a mountain and filling the whole earth, as Daniel said it should in the  last days. ##Daniel 2:26-47## Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum, with several of the Apostles and Elders and many Saints, have already sealed their testimony with thir blood, and to-day prisons are crowded with the Elders of Israel for keeping the commandments of God, and many others have been driven into exile for the same cause.   are stirred up and are desirous to de- stroy the Church and Kingdom of God from off the earth. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they His ways. The Gentile or Christian world to-day can no more commit sins, and be guilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy, whoredoms, or murder, or commit any abominations, and escape the wrath of God, then could Sodom and Gomorrah, or the antediluvian world, or ancient Israel. The word of the Lord has been proclaimed against the Gentiles and all the inhabitants of  the earth in the last days who com- mit sin, and it will as assuredly be fulfilled as in ancient days. The Lord has a controversy with this genera- tion, and He will judge the inhabi- tants according to the deeds done in the body, and none can stay His  hand.   who dwell in the flesh to-day, that the 56 years which have passed away since the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have taken into the spirit world all our Prophets, Apostles, Elders and Saints who have finished their testi- mony in the flesh. Their voice is hushed in death and their testimony is closed. They are mingling with the spirits of the righteous and wait- ing for the great day of the coming of the Son of Man, when Jesus Christ will come in the clouds of heaven to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body. But though they have passed away, is the work of God finished on the earth? Verily no. Has the warning voice ceased to be heard by the inhabitants of the earth? It has not. All of us who remain in the flesh are under as much obligation to lift the warning voice and reap while the day lasts as were those who have passed away.   made thee a watchman unto the House of Israel." "When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast de- livered thy soul." ##Ezekiel 3:17-19## This is precisely our condition to-day. As Apostles, Seventies, High Priests, and Elders, we and all men who bear any portion of the Holy Priesthood, are watch- men upon the walls of Zion and mes- sengers to all the inhabitants of the  earth, and all of us will be held re- sponsible if we do not improve our time and lift the warning voice, as far as we have opportunity, and warn this generation of the judgments of God which await them.   very nigh unto the door of this na- tion and this generation, and they will overtake the world before it is prepared for that time. Even the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, and he will come as a thief in the night. ##2 Peter 3:10## Who is prepared to abide the day of His coming? It is our duty to labor and reap. Then every man should be diligent in that sphere in which he is called to act, that his garments may be clean from the blood of all men.   generation of men who inhabited the earth who were more wicked, or who were practising greater abominations, or who were sinning against greater light and knowledge, or who had a greater flood of judgments proclaimed against them by the word of the Lord, than the generation in which we live. Therefore, as Saints of the living God, who bear the Holy Priesthood, we shall be under condemnation if we do not lift up the warning voice against the evils and abominations which ex- ist, so far as we have opportunity. How many woes the Prophets and Apostles have proclaimed against those who fight against Zion. "Woe unto all those who discomfort my people, and drive and murder them, and testify against them, saith the Lord of hosts. A generation of vipers shall not escape the damnation of hell. Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment, in the sea- son thereof, for them all. For there is a time appointed for every man, according at his work shall be." ##Doctrine and Covenants 121:23-25##   sponsibility is very great. The Prophets who organized the Church and laid the foundation of this last dispensation, with a whole quorum of Apostles, have finished their testi- mony had gone into the spirit world. We have been called to take their places. What manner of men ought we to be? The whole earth is ripen- ing in iniquity, and the Zion of God should be prepared for the coming of the bridegroom. We should humble ourselves before the Lord and be in a position to be filled with the spirit of our calling with the Holy Ghost, and with the revelations of Jesus Christ, that we may know the mind and will of God concerning us, and be pre- pared to magnify our calling and bring to pass righteousness, and be valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ to the end of our pilgrimage, here in the flesh. The Prophets, Apostles, and all the heavenly hosts are watching over us. There never was a time when the work of God re- quired a more faithful testimony and labor from the Apostles and Elders than to-day.   stand connected with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as messengers to the nations of the earth, it has fal,en to your lot to go forth and assist to prune the vineyard once more, and for the last time, before the coming of the Son of Man. The Lord said, fifty seven years ago, that the field was white for the harvest, and He had set His hand to prune the vineyard once more, and for the last time. The Elders were com- manded at that day to thrust in their sickle and reap while it was called to-day, for soon night would come, when no man could reap. ##Doctrine and Covenants 11:3## Brethren, it is much nearer night now than it was fifty-seven years ago. The Savior said at that day, that the angels were crying day and night for the privilege to go forth and reap down the earth. He informed them they must wait a little season until the harvest was fully ripe. The na- tions must be warned, Zion must be established, and the wheat, or the Saints, be gathered into the garner, then the angels might go forth and reap the tares, gather them in bun- bles and prepare them for the burn- ing. ##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5-7##   the Saints have been gathered to  Zion from the nations of the earth. But you are called upon at this late day to still go forth and warn the Gentiles with the proclamation of the Gospel. Therefore, brethren, you who are called to go into the vineyard, whether Apostles, High Priests, Seventies, or Elders, do not be weary in well doing. Remember, you are messengers of salvation. Keep yourselves pure and spotless before God and all men. Seek to bring to pass righteousness, and save the souls of men. Labor faithfully that your garments may be clean from the blood of all men, and that the nations may be left without ex- cuse in the day of God's judgments upon the wicked, which is nigh at hand, and those judgments will be poured out without measure.   should be righteous and holy men, and call upon the Lord in mighty prayer, in order to prevail. It is the privilege of every Elder in Israel, who is laboring in the vineyard, if he will live up to his privileges, to have dreams, visions, and revelations, and the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, that he may be able thor- oughly to gather out the blood of Israel and the meek of the earth and bring them into the fold of Christ.   called to bear record of the Gospel of Christ to the nations of the earth are many times called to pass through persecutions for the Gospel's sake, and in some instances to lay down their lives, as did the ancient Saints, and quite a number in our day, for  Christ's sake. But there seems to be a special crown of glory laid up for every man who is martyed for Christ's sake and the Gospel's. No matter in what age of the world he lays down his life for Christ's, he will find it again, and eternal life in the world to come. Therefore, brethren, let us be diligent in our labors in this  last hour in the vineyard. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, if he labored all the days of his life and saved but one soul, how great would be his joy in the Kingdom of Heaven with that one soul. ##Doctrine and Covenants 18:15-16## We have everything to en- courage us in our labors in the vine- yard of the Lord.   the nations of the earth, there is a great labor and responsibility resting upon the whole ministry who dwell in Zion. There is labor sufficient for every man who bears any portion of the Holy Priesthood in the various capacities in which the brethren are called to act. The High Priests,  whose calling is to preside, are called upon to officiate in Zion as High  Councilors, Presidents of Stakes and Counselors, Bishops and Counselors, Superintendents of Sabbath Schools and mutual improvement associa- tions. In every capacity in which they are called to act, they have an immense field  in which to improve their talents and magnify their call- ings. Here is where the High Priests are mainly called to preside, officiate and labor.   Holy Priesthood, in all its various branches, offices and labors, had a greater work to perform than in our day. The searching out of iniquity, the purifying, sanctifying and cleans- ing of the people, the uniting of the Saints and the general perfecting of Zion resting upon the brethren and the Holy Priesthood who dwell in Zion.   people, should give diligent heed to the late Epistle of the First Presiden- cy, which has been published to the  world. The counsel they have given upon the various items they have re- ferred to should be strictly carried out. The breaking of the Sabbath day and pleasure excursions upon that day should not be indulged in by the Latter-day Saints. The Pres- idents of Stakes and their counselors, the Bishops and their counselors, whose immediate duty it is to watch over the stakes and wards, have a great responsibility and duty to per- form. Iniquity must be sought out. Zion cannot prosper when sin and in- quity are permitted to dwell in her midst.   sponsible fields of labor in Zion is that committed to the care of those who preside over and teach in the primaries, Sabbath schools, and im- provement associations, and those who are teaching private day schools among the Latter-day Saints. Who can comprehend the result of the la- bor performed by the Elders of Israel in these branches? No man, unless filled with the revelations of Heaven and the inspiration of Almighty God. We send out hundreds of Elders, who go to the nations of the earth to preach the Gospel of Christ. After spending two or three years as mis- sionaries, if they have converted a dozen souls and brought them into the Church, they think they have done a good work, which they cer- tainly have. But here, the Elders who are presiding over the teaching in these institutions in Zion, filled with the children of the Saints, have an army of immortal souls before them to guide and teach, and to di- rect their minds, that they may be qualified to step forth and take hold of the Church and kingdom of  God and build it up and bear it off triumphantly, after their fathers and elders are laid in the tomb. O what a mission is given to the sons of Eph- raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter- day Saints! To warn the whole world of the judgments which are to come, preach the Gospel to all people, gath- er the saints from all nations, build up Zion, and prepare for the coming of the Son of Man, standing in holy places, while judgments waste the  wicked.   Savior that all the Saints of God should observe, but which, I fear, we do not as we should, and that is, to pray always and faint not. I fear, as a people, we do not pray enough, in faith. We should call upon the Lord in mighty prayer, and make all our wants known unto Him. For if He does not protect and deliver us and save us, no other power will. There- fore our trust is entirely in Him. Therefore our prayers should ascend  into the ears of our heavenly Father day and night.   brethren who are in prison, or under bonds, or driven into exile for our religion, or for keeping the command- ments of God. You should not think that any strange thing has happened unto you. Persecution is a legacy that has been handed down from father Adam to our day. It was said of old that all men who lived godly in Christ Jesus should suffer perse- cution. If we meet with no persecu- tion in our day, we shall hardly feel at home when we go into the spirit  world and meet with the ancient  prophets and with Christ and the Apostles, who passed through much persecution and tribulation. Many of them were crucified or otherwise put to death. They sealed their tes- timony with their own blood, as was the case with Joseph and Hyrum and several of the Apostles, Elders, and Saints in our day.   passing through these afflictions, let us not cherish revenge or hatred in our hearts towards our persecutors. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." ##Romans 12:19## Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when nailed to the cross, and while in the agony of death, cried, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." ##Luke 23:34## Why did He say this to His Father in Heaven? Because the Son of God knew full well what would be the result of His  death upen the heads of His mur- derers. He knew what awaited the whole Jewish nation, when that peo- ple said, "Let His blood be on us and on our children." ##Matthew 27:25## He fully com- prehended the great suffering that awaited the Jews and their posterity for the next eighteen hundred years. He knew that all that Moses and the Prophets, as well as what He had spoken Himself, against the Jewish nation, would come to pass; for God had spoken it through them, and his words never fail.   fact that Jerusalem was overthrown, the foundation of the Temple dug up and not one stone left upon another. The Jews fell by famine, by pestilence and by the sword, until twelve hun- dred thousand dead bodies were car- ried through the gates outside of the walls of Jerusalem during the dis- tress of the siege under Titus, and a remnant was taken captive and scat- tered throughout the world among the Gentile nations, and the Jews have been a hiss and a byword, and have been trampled under the feet of the Gentiles until the present day, and the end is not yet, the yoke is not yet broken from off their necks.   ment of the Word of God to the Jewish nation. So I say to all my brethren who are in exile, or in prison, for the Gospel's sake, or for keeping the commandments of God, do not harbor any vengeance or ha- tred against this nation, or against those who have aided or abetted in your sufferings, but rather go before the Lord and pray that He will sof- ten the hearts of the rulers of the na- tion, that they will give unto the Latter day Saints the same rights and privileges in the worshiping of God according to the dictates of their own consciences as are guaranteed by the Constitution of our Government, which was given by the inspiration of the God of heaven for a wise pur- pose in Himself.   quest of my brethren, I answer, for the same reason that Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for the know not what they do." For as the God of heaven fulfilled all His words which He spoke concerning Judea and Jerusalem, so will He fulfill all that He has spoken concerning the Gentiles and all the nations of the earth in the last days.   of heaven lives, and has established His throne on high, just so truly will He bring to pass the fulfilment of His words. He will pour out that flood of judgments upon our nation and upon all the nations of the earth, which has been proclaimed by every inspired man since the world began. The seals will be opened, the plagues poured out, and Great Babylon will fall. This generation has been warn- ed for the last fifty years by inspired and righteous men, and after their testimony will come the testimony of thundering, of lightning, of floods, of earthquakes, and of pestilence, and famine, and war, and the flames of devouring fire, for by fire and by sword will the Lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the Lord will be many. For the Lord has said, "My sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon Idumea, or the world: and who is able to stand?" ##Isaiah 34:5##   hand of God in this work. The God of heaven will teach this nation and all other nations on earth, that He is stronger than man. He pays no re- gard to nations or numbers, in the fulfillment of his purposes, for He holds in His hand the destiny of all men and nations, and no power be- neath the heavens can hinder His work. The God of Israel has set his hand to gather His people from all nations and build up His Church and establish Zion in all that beauty, power, and glory which Isaiah and other Prophets saw, and to build up His kingdom, which shall fill the whole earth, and in which Jesus of Nazareth will establish his throne and sit thereon, and reign over the earth for one thousand years, as the Prophet Daniel and other Prophets have declared. And it will come to pass in spite of earth and hell and all the unbelief of the whole Christian Gentile world. If our nation or the Gentiles do not believe this, let them wait and see, and they will not have to wait long before they will see the signs manifest of the beginning of these things. So far as the Saints are concerned, the Spirit of God will bear record to their spirits as they read these testimonies, of their truth.   mony of Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 24:14|24th chapter 14th verse##â€”"I the Lord have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; 1 I will not go back, neither will I  repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord God."     ENDENTRY    Relation Thereto.     the Saints generally:   tude and thanksgiving to our heavenly Father that we announce to the Latter-day Saints that the Temple which is being erected at Manti has been so nearly completed as to be ready for the upholstering, furniture, carpets etc., which are necessary to put it in a state of complete prepara- tion for the sacred labors to be per- formed therein. This is the third building of this character which in the  kind providence of God the Latter-day Saints have been permitted to erect and finished in these mountains. The  Temple at Salt Lake City is also pro- gressing in a satisfactory manner, which, when finished, will be the fourth Temple that has been construct- ed by the Saints under the direction of the Almighty since we came to these valleys.   have had these glorious privileges granted unto them! Our hearts swell with irrepressible feelings of thanks- giving and joy to our Father in heaven that he has permitted His Saints to build these houses. They now have opportunities to act as saviors of their fellow men, which but few genera- tions of the children of men have ever enjoyed. The great work of the res- toration of the dead which will occu- py the time and thought of future generations has now begun, never more to end until the earth is sancti- fied and the plan of salvation devised in the eternal worlds for human re- demption is fully consummated.   circular is to present to all the mem- bers of the Church the opportunity of contributing, according to their means and liberality, something towards the furnishing of the Manti Temple. Here- tofore the contributions for that build- ing have been confined to the Stakes which are numbered in what is known as the "Manti Temple District." Be- fore the Logan Temple was completed an opporutnity was given to the  Saints to contribute towards the pur- chasing of its furnishings, furniture, etc. They gladly responded to the call which was made upon them. We feel that they will, on the present oc- casion, appreciate the privilege of contributing in like manner towards the purchasing of suitable upholstery, carpeting, etc., for the Manti Temple. The funds of the Superintendent are exhausted, and contracts are already made for needed articles, which have to be met at an early date.   twenty-five cents upwards, so that those who are the most limited in means need not be debarred, while those who are more wealthy, can have the satisfaction and pleasure of mak- ing donations according to their ability for the completion of this noble edifice. We would like the Presidents and Bishops to give every one an opportunity of doing some- thing in this direction, and the names  of all, with the amounts contributed, should be carefully taken.   every man, woman and child in the  Church recorded in the Archives of the Temple as having contributed something towards its erection and completion.   can either be forwarded to the office of the Presiding Bishop or to the Chief Clerkâ€”Brother James Jack, at the President's Office.   tions should be made and remitted as promptly as possible, as the need for this means is pressing.     tles. ENDENTRY    in His Son, Repentance and Forsaking of Sin, Obedi- ence of the Ordinances, and Keeping of the Law.   Wilford Woodruff,   ter day Saints.   letter from you, some time since,  wherein you solicit for publication "an array of sentiments from the leading men of the Territory," etc I now at the last moment, after having been so busy, undertake, with leasure, to comply with your request.     this Territory are a religious people By revelation and inspiration from Almighty God the Latter day Saints are called upon to perpetuate and establish righteous principles,  not only in the Territory, but throughout the earth. The Dis pensation of the Fulness of Times is ushering in upon the inhabitants of the earth, and with it are re- ceived the principles of Eternal  Life, the greatest gift of God to man. The Latter day Saints who constitute the largest proportion of the people who inhabit these Rocky  Mountain vales have revealed to them this gift through Jesus, the Mediatorâ€”the Savior of the world.   Saints, Oh! ye House of Israel, and Oh! ye inhabitants of the earth, re- member! that when God, the  Father, gave His only begotten son as a ransom for your sins, He gave  a Christmas gift that cannot be ex- celled---the gift of eternal life! Through this gift ye can possess the riches of Eternity.   given in return as an acknowledg- ment for this gift? It cannot be bought with money, so far as the  riches of this world is concerned it is without price. But the price of it is, the love of God the Father, faith in His Son Jesus, repentance and the forsaking of sin, obedience to the sacred ordinance of baptism,  and the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and then the keeping of all His holy  and revealed laws.   some of the religious principles adopted by the Latter-day Saints, and how to obtain the gift of eter- nal life should be the highest am- bition of every man, woman, and  child. The earth groans under a false Christianity. The true Chris- tian principles that were advocated by the Savior and His Apostles are no longer practised throughout modern "Christendom." The earth is deluged with false Gospel, false religion, and with different systems and plans of salvation. The inhab- tants of the earth are being "tossed to and fro by every wind of doc- trine." ##Ephesians 4:14## False teachers "having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof" have sprung up in every land and clime; parties, sects, and organizations under religious garbs are extending their multita- rious false theories, enveloping the mind of man with a hopeless faith. ##2 Timothy 3:5##  The signs of the times portend the fulfillment of the prophecies that have been made concerning the great wickedness that should be upon the earth in the latter days, when great plagues shall be poured out upon the world and Angels pour out the vials of the  wrath of Almighty God. But pre- vious to this all people are to be warned by the proclamation of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ, committed through the Angel that John the Revelator saw "flying through the midst of Heaven, having the ever- lasting Gospel to preach to every  nation, kindred, tongue, and peo- ple, saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God, and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come.' " ##Revelation 14:6-7##   proclamation has been sent forth to the world for the last half century and over, and we may expect the judgments to follow these declara- tions, for it is decreed "the hour of His judgment is come."   ered to these mountain vales, by  the revelations of God, to prepare a place of refuge, for the gathering in of Israel, that the honest in heart from all nations might have a place of safety and escape the judgments  of the wicked. And while the wick- ed rule and the people mourn, the Saints of the Most High will con- tinue to establish the principles of righteousness, the principles of free- dom and true government, until the Lord Himself comes to reign as  "King of Kings and Lord of Lords."     ter day Saints is founded upon  their unity. "In unity there is strength." "United we stand, divided we fall," is our true maxim: And as Paul, the Apostle of old, said to the Former-day Saints, so say I to the Latter-day Saints. "Be ye not unequally yoked to- gether with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what com munion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?" (##2 Corinthians 6:14-15|2 Cor VI., 14, 15, 16##)   evant and very important to the social status of the Latter-day Saints, for, as Paul further says: "What agreement hath the Temple of God with idols? for ye are the Temple of the Living God; as God hath said: 'I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.  Wherefore come out from among,  and be ye separate; saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean  thing, and I will receive you; and  will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.' " (##2 Corinthians 6:16-18|2 Cor. VI; 16, 17, 18)   with the world, nor the things of the world, and keep ourselves pure and unspotted from the world.  The Savior says "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." (##John 15:19|S. John, XV, 19.##)   "chosen out of the world" and ga- thered here into the tops of the mountains for the purpose of build- ing up the Church of Christ, that in this Church they might be  taught more fully the ways of the  Lord and learn to walk in His paths, that they may be prepared to establish the Kingdom of God spoken of by Daniel, the Prophet, that he saw should be set up in the latter days by the God of Heaven, and which shall never be destroyed or left to other people, but shall stand forever. ##Daniel 2:26-47##   derstanding their calling, cannot  afford to mingle, in their associa- tions, with the world; for in the  very nature of things the two ele- ments will not unite and still re- main in a healthy and prosperous  condition. "Love not the world, neither the things of the world; if any man loves the world the love  of the Father is not in him," so say the Scriptures; and those who are not for the Kingdom are against it. ##1 John 2:15## Therefore, as the chosen  people of God, we ought to honor our Father who has chosen us, and be very careful whom we associate  with. In all our dealings and as- sociations let them be with the Latter-day Saints. Be watchful of the sons and daughters of Zion that they do not become "unequally yoked together with unbelievers." ##2 Corinthians 6:14## Let the sons of Zion take the daughters of Zion to wife. Let the people of God be united in all things, politically, religiously, socially, commercially, and industrially. "If ye are not one ye are not mine" says the Sa- vior; and also, He says: "Be ye one as the Father and I are one." ##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27## ##John 17:21-22##   adhere and give heed to these wise sayings, the Lord, in His own due time,â€”in the time of the harvest, shall send forth His reapers, the Angels, who shall gather out the tares to be burned; and "The Son of Man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing  of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the King- dom of their Father," (##Matthew 13:41-43|St. Matthew, xiii; 41, 42, 43.##)   Christmas!" and a "Happy New Year!"

ENDENTRY    World.   more in the dispensation of Provi- dence we are called to mourn the de- parture from this life of a friend and  brother.   President of the Church, Elder John  Taylor, was called to rest on the  evening of July 25th, 1887. In sor- row for our loss, we, your brethren, join with you in mourning his depar- ture. Having fought the good fight, he earned a crown of endless glory, and now mingles with Joseph and Brigham.   God is with us still to comfort, inspire  and direct us heretofore. Peace be un- to you. As upon two former occasions in our history, the duty and responsi- bility of presiding over and directing the affairs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all the world devolves upon the Twelve Apos- tles. With the blessing of the Lord  and the faith and prayers of His peo- ple, we hope to do our duty until we, too, shall be laid to rest.   living, let us give our hearts to God,  sanctify ourselves by keeping his commandments, have oil in our lamps,  our houses in order, and hopefully and prayerfully look forward to the  day of deliverance, the set time for  the accomplishment of which is fast approaching.   holding his memory sacred, let us  trust in the God of Heaven, remember  the living, unite our hearts, and earn- estly strive for the redemption of  Zion.   one against another, but forgive each other's trespasses; that the Holy  Ghost may be our constant compan- ion, and the doctrines of the priest- hood distil on our minds like the dews of heaven.

ENDENTRY  eternal and everlasting priesthood is bestowed upon us for the purpose alone of administering in the ordin- ances of life and salvation, both for the living and the dead, and no man on earth can use the priesthood for  any other purpose than the work of  the ministry, the perfecting of the  Saints, edifying the body of Christ,  establishing the kingdom of heaven, and redeeming Zion. If we attempt  to use it for unrighteous purposes, like lightning from heaven our power,  sooner or later, falls, and we fail to accomplish the design of God.   and sisters, beware of the pride of the world, and, casting vanity far from us, be true to God, true to each  other and end true to the coven- ants that we have made. Purg- ing ourselves from iniquity and the workers thereof, let us set our faces like flint against sin and wicked- ness of every kind. So shall we, while  patiently following the Redeemer,  eventually gain the victory over flesh,  hell and the grave.

This will depend upon the  number of persons who may be pres- ent, and who may desire to witness  and take part in the proceedings.  At Logan the number of persons pres- ent was so great that it required  three days' services to enable all who  desired to be present to get admis- sion to the Temple.   not so good as they were for reach- ing Logan. The Utah Central Rail- road runs from the north and south to  Nephi. At that point the Sanpete  Valley Railroad connects with it and  reaches into Ches- ter, a distance of about fifteen miles  from Manti. From this point convey- ance will necessarily be by teams.   cers and members of the Church who  can possibly be present at the dedica- tion should be three there, still it will be  necessary for all who go, to make their own arrangements for transpor- tation from Chester to Manti, and also  for their entertainment while there,  either at Manti or some of the adjacent  settlements. The accommodations at  Manti are limited; but on such an oc- casion as this, no doubt, everything  will be done that is possible by the  residents to make the visitors com- fortable and to furnish th  the nec- essary entertainment.

Yes, I thank God that the young men of Israel are rising up and going forth into the vine- yard and magnifying the Holy Priest- hood, and preparing themselves to fulfil their high destiny in this important dis- pensation. As I look over the history of this Church and kingdom of God on  the earth, and think of the army of faith- ful laborers in the kingdom who have passed to the other side of the vail, and realize that I soon shall follow them, and  as I draw near to the close of my testi- mony and labor in the flesh, my anxiety greatly deepens and increases concern- ing the rising generation which I am to  leave behind me in these mountains of Israel. I am thoroughly satisfied in my own mind that there never was a genera- tion of young men and maidens since  the world was, that had awaiting them the same high destiny that awaits the  young men and maidens who dwell in these valleys, surrounded by the ever- lasting hills, upon whose heads rest the blessings which the old Patriarch Jacob sealed upon the heads of his sons, Ephraim, and their posterity. Through their lineage the sons and daughters who inhabit these mountains claim, and, as God lives, will inherit the blessings sealed upon the head of  Ephraim in the last days.   and events as weighty as ever rested upon the earth will have to be met by the generation which follows us. The  whole earth is groaning under the weight of darkness, crime, corruption and abominations, and its inhabitants are preparing themselves for the out- pouring of the just judgments and in- dignation of an avenging God. In the  midst of this scene of events, where  will either heaven or earth look for a  people, except the sons and daughters of Zion, to hold the helm of state, or to prepare a place of safety that mortal men may stand in holy places and be preserved, while the great judgments of God sweep the wicked from off the earth, in fulfilment of the revelations of St. John and other Apostles and Prophets who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost? Though heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of what has been predicted will fall unful- filled. Neither God nor angels look to any other people than the Latter-day Saintsâ€”the Elders of Israel, the young men of Zion, to go forth bearing the Holy Priesthood to warn this Christian, Gentile generation with the Gospel of Jesus Christ of the judgments which are  to come; and their testimony will prove a savor of life unto life or of death unto death to all who hear it.   young men who are in the vineyard of the Lord, or who dwell in Zion, prepare  yourselves for that which is to come. Take upon yourselves the whole armor of God, and bear a true and faithful testi- mony unto all people where providence may call you, that your garments may be clean from the blood of all men, for the eyes of all the heavenly hosts of God, angels and men, are watching over you with feelings of the deepest inter- est. You are called and ordained of  God to prepare this great and mighty work for the coming of the Son of Man.

We, therefore,  take this method of calling your atten- tion to these requests, and take the  liberty of emphasizing what the com- mission have said, that our influence  may be joined to theirs in impressing  you with the importance of giving them  the fullest aid and information, and that,  too, at once.

I say, after the Lord has set all these things before us, He says unto us, "If you believe me you will labor while the day lasts, for soon night will come when no man can work." There are great events at the door. This generation knows not what awaits them. When the people reject the testimony of the Elders of Israel and turn them from their doors, they little know what they are doing or what their reward will be; and while our nation is laboring for the destruction of the Church and kingdom of God, and trample under their feet the laws and Constitution which have been bequeathed unto us by our forefathers through the inspiration of Almighty God, they little know of the seed they sow or the fearful harvest they are  doomed to reap. These eternal truths  rest with weight upon my mind.   fall of Rome was attributable to the gen- eral corruption of the people, and to the engrossing love of pleasure and idle- ness. Work, in the last days of Rome, was regarded as only fit for slaves. Its citizens ceased to pride themselves on the virtues and characters of their great forefathers, and the empire fell because it did not deserve to live. When nation- al character ceases to be upheld, a na- tion may be regarded as next to lost. When it ceases to esteem and to prac- tice the virtues of truthfulness, honesty, integrity and justice, it does not deserve to live."   drawn the picture of what has followed all cities, nations and kingdoms of the  whole earth from the creation of the  world until now, and will continue until the end of the world. The history of Sodom and Gomorrah, the antediluvian world, and of Nine- veh, Sidon, Babylon the Great,  as well as Jerusalem itself, all have fallen when they were ripened in iniquity, and all this in fulfilment of the word of the  Lord through the mouths of holy men, who spoke as they were moved upon by  the inspiration of eternal truth. The Lord has already swept off two great nations from the American continent, in fulfilment of His word, when they were ripened in iniquity, and what inspired man can look with indifference upon the vortex into which the American govern- ment is hastening, through the same pro- cess, to their utter destruction and over- throw? Who will save the American flag and Consititution? I heard Joseph Smith say, the Elders of Israel would have it to do, and he was a Prophet of God.

But, praise to God, our heavenly Father, who pioneered us here. Although I was not numbered among the 143 who came as that noble band, I was with you nearly all the way from Green River, and only stayed back to let the Presi- dent's company keep on the lead. You remember coming out on the east bench to meet the battalion detach  ment, under Captain James Brown. I was then one of the boys, and I im- mediately went to work making ado- bies and laying them up into the fort wall of what was called the Old Fort, of which I believe I built about one- half with my own hands. I know I built the first chimney that ever drew smoke in these valleys. It was for President Brigham Young, in a log house on the east side of the Fort.   reminiscences of the past, when they bring pleasing recollections of having done our duty, and as there must always be a first, I have the honor of  being the father of the     Young Elizabeth Steele, born August 9th, 1847, at 3:40 a.m. I also made the first lasts and the first gaiter boots that were made in these valleys.

I also  spent two years on a mission among the Indians and enjoyed myself very much among them, and do not think the Red man beyond the pale of re- demption. I have observed many good traits of character among them; one is, that they are generally true to their friends.   old times, and am pleased to see that my old friend William Carter, who turned the first sod in the valley, has  not been forgotten. He did more ditching in one day than I could do. He ditched 16 rods, three feet wide and three and half feet deep in one day. There are many of my old pioneer and  soldier brethren that I remember with pleasure, and as the DESERET NEWS says, will be remembered with pleas- ure in after generations, as their valor and integrity is not at present fully ap- preciated, but posterity will do them justice. I can rejoice to learn of the  increase of our people and the spread of truth. Whereas, on the 24th of July, 1847, there were 143 pioneers and 150 battalion boys and some 20 of our sis- ters, who are mothers in Israel, also a  few Mississippi Saints, who wintered at Colorade State who were the little nucleus around which gathered so many thousands and have spread around into other territories, it makes me think of a sum in multiplication in compound num- bers. If six will multiply in fifty-eight years into 300,000, what will 300,000 mul- tiply into in the next fifty-eight years if  all are faithful in keeping the com- mandments of the Lord. If Israel had only allowed themselves to have been governed by good counsel, where there are now a few Saints there would have been many. However, Israel is on the increase, and will never be less, and the little affliction wherewith we are afflicted is merely a fatherly hint that we are not forgotten by Him. I thank God all the time that we are not allowed to run wild like sheep without a shepherd, and I hope  the time is not far distant when we  will see our Apostles and leading brethren among us once more.   ent of Sunday school gathered his little flock around him, organized them in good shape, and we spent our 24th in singing, reciting, etc. I had the pleasure of making a ten minutes speech. All went off well with a dance in the evening, presided over by Brother Martin Slack.   our Bishop Wm. A. Bringhurst is in prison for obeying the law of the Lord. It is said in the Scriptures the  time will come when the Lord will take to Him His great power, and  rule the nations, and Zion will arise and shine.   still good, although you are not per- mitted to be among us. I constantly pray for our leading brethren; those whom the Lord has chosen to lead His people, and may God continue to you long life, health and peace, and pros- perity to Israel is the constant prayer  of your brother in the Gospel.     with the foregoing, to state that Brother Taylors- ville, this county, claims to be the father of the first male child born in this valley or rather its vicinity. His son William Harker, who is still liv- ing in the same ward where his father resides, was born in Echo CaÃ±on, Utah, while the family were traveling hither- ward, on September 26th, 1847. Brother Joseph Harker also erected the first cabin on the west side of Jordan River, in November and December, 1848. We had the pleasure of a call from the veteran this afternoon. ENDENTRY  Officers and Members of the Sabbath Schools:   ago this day I passed through Emigra- tion CaÃ±on with President' Brigham  Young. He was taken sick on East CaÃ±on Creek, and I made a bed for him in my carriage. When we came upon the bench I turned the side of the vehicle to the west so that he  could obtain a fair view of the valley. President Young arose from his bed and took a survey of the country be- fore him for several minutes. He then said to me, "Drive on down into the  valley, this is our abiding place. I  have seen it before in vision. In this valley will be built the City of the Saints and the Temple of our God." I drove down to the encampent al- ready formed by a portion of our company, who had cut a  road through the quakingasp groves of timber which were in the bed of  the caÃ±on and come in ahead of us.   half-past eleven of the morning of the 24th of July, 1847. The brethren had already turned out City Creek and irri- gated the dry and barren soil, being the first irrigation ever performed by any one in these mountains in this age. They had also commenced to plough some ground, and that noble pioneer, William Carter, whose circumstances prevent his meeting with the pioneers today, broke the first ground and laid the first furrow. The plowshare that performed the work is on the stand to- day. On my arrival in camp, before I  ate my dinner, I planted two bushels of potatoes in the ground broken up. President Young commenced to re- cover from his sickness the hour he entered the valley. On a day or two following our arrival, a remarkable in- cident occurred.   with several of the Apostles on the higher ground northwest of our en- campment, he suddenly stepped out, stuck his cane into the barren ground and sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right here will stand the Temple of our God." We had a peg driven down and it was nearly in the middle of the Temple as it stands today, which Tem- ple was built without any regard to the spot designated by President Young at the time.   top of a high point on the north of the city, which Presi- dent Young named "Ensign Peak." We also visited the Hot and Warm Springs. On the 27th we drove to the West Mountains and visited the Salt Lake, President Young being the first to dip his hand into the briny water. We walked dryshod to the Black Rock and took a bath in the Lake. Afterwards preparations were made for laying out the city, and I with other brethren as- sisted President Young in laying out the ground and streets with chain and compass. We laid out a block of ten acres upon which to build a Temple, and city lots of one acre and a quarter, and streets eight rods wide, all of which has been published by his- torians.   ters on the seventh day of April, ac- companied by seven other Apostles and other men, all told 143 men and 3 women. The Apostles were Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, W. Wood- ruff, Willard Rich- ards, Amasa Lyman and Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor arrived soon after, lead- ing companies of families. Orson Hyde remained at Kanesville. We trav- eled the first 500 miles without any  grass. With the exception of a little grain we fed our animals, they lived entirely on the bark of cottonwood limbs and saplings, which they gnawed from the trees we would lay before them for their night's meal. This company of 143 men traveled 1030 miles, making their roads and building their bridges. In one instance we had to form a guard of a wedge shape for three days and nights to keep our company from being trampled to death by an enormous herd of buffalo that had gathered from  the mountains and were migrating in a solid body to the plains below. The herd was judged to be sixty miles in length, and numbered not less than one million. They were traveling east and we were traveling west. We were three days passing though the herd, and we all breathed freer when we were clear of them. No other class of men will ever witness the same scene again upon the face of the earth. Brother Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got his horses loose and mixed with the herd, and it was with great difficulty that we obtained them again.   to secure an abiding place, a home for the people, we did not lose sight of other important matters. President Young contemplated at that early day the building of a railroad across the continent, and we marked out the route which we thought the national road would take to unite the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.   Snow entered the valley two or three days before the body of the pioneers; but where are those men today, and where is President Brigham Young and the Apostles who accompanied him? All are in the spirit world mingling with the martyred Prophets where they can plead for their brethren. Not one of them living today except my- self, and but few of the pioneers re- main. We have buried a whole quo- rum of Twelve Apostles since we en- tered these valleys of the mountains. The remnant of Zion's Camp, Mormon Battalion and the Pioneers number but very few today. Those of us who re- main will soon pass away, but our posterity live and are numbered in the  Primaries, the Sabbath schools and the Mutual Improvement Associa- tions, and are this day assembled in this great Tabernacle to celebrate the arrival of the Pioneers into this great American Deseret, which today through the blessing of God and the labor of the Pioneers is blossoming as the rose.   about a month in this valley during which period we erected what is  known as the Old Fort, surrounding three sides of the ten-acre block, with an adobie wall about ten feet high on the outside, and the east side with log cabins.

It is not wisdom for me to occupy your time with a long address upon an occasion of this kind, but I have referred to a few incidents of our peculiar journey into this barren desert, that you may keep in mind the toil, the care and the harships which your fathers endured in laying the foundation of the Zion of our God which is to be established in  the mountains of Israel, in fulfillment of the blessing of the old Patri- arch Jacob pronounced upon his pos- terity that should be fulfilled in the valleys of the everlasting hills in the latter-days. And upon the heads of the rising generation of the Latter- day Saints rests the responsiblity of building up the Kingdom of God upon the foundations which their fathers have laid. And also of building up a State in which shall dwell virtue, tem- perance, industry, frugality and hon- esty; a State which will do honor to  the American government, where wholesome laws shall be administed in equity and justice to all of its citi zens according to the letter and spirit of the Constitution given by inspira- tion of Almighty God to our fore- fathers.   your father and your mother and your God, that your days may be long and prosperous in these valleys ol of the mountains which the Lord your God hath given unto you.   able you to fulfill the object of your creation here on the earth to the satis- faction of yourselves and your Crea- tor, is the earnest desire of your friend and brother,   ENDENTRY  who assisted in baptizing some seven thousand in 1840, and that our mis- sion and labors will soon be found upon the other side of the vailâ€”I say, while these reflections rest upon me, I feel de- sirous to urge upon my brethren, the Elders of Israel, to labor faithfully while the day lasts. Try to save the souls of  men. Bless and not curse. Keep pure and clean before the Lord. Pray ear- nestly for the Holy Spirit to guide you. Be patient in well doing. If you are persecuted and derided for the Gospel's sake, remember that Jesus has trod  that road before you, and descended lower than ever you will be called to go; and if you are cast out of doors and get hungry, have to travel on foot, get weary and sore, and are without money, re- member that others, even your fathers after the flesh, have passed through the same ordeal. Wil- lard and Orson, Wil- ford and George A., have traveled over the same road, preached in the same halls and streets, got hungry the same as you are. We are all in the same old ship of Zion, and thanks be to God for the privilege.   hell conspire against you, they shall not prevail if you are built upon my rock, saith the Lord. May the blessings and power of God, with His Holy Spirit, rest upon all the Elders and Saints of God in the vineyard of the Lord, as well as those in Zion.

Wood arrived on the 10th inst., safe and sounds, and were met by Brother Manoa and myself with a crew of natives, at the steamer. We had a terrible time waiting for the steamer, however, as it was four days behind advertized time, having had to wait in San Francisco for the British mails.  We spent most of that time day and night, in sun and rain, out to sea in the open boat, fearing to go ashore lest, when the steamer came, we could not reach it in time. After looking anxionsly at the horizon from Saturday noon till Tuesday night in vain, and being quite exhansted from exposure and want of sleep, we were quite disheartened. Wednesday morn- ing at daylight, however, the steamer was sighted, and we immediately for- got all our troubles and put off to meet her.   there first, however, and being four  days behind time the officers of the  steamer would not delay a second the  bundling of the baggage for Samoa into her. So by the time we got there most of the brethren's baggage had been transferred, and we had to pay $2 for the accommodation of getting it away from them again.  We finally got every thing all right and had a pretty pleasant passage in our boat to Aunuu. We arrived here next morning at 9 o'clock, badly worn out bodily, but feeling well in spirits. Brother Manoa was taken down with a heavy fever throngh exposure and exhaustion, he not being very strong. The rest of us were all right after a night's rest. Manoa is around all right again now.   together with the shoes, shoe-mending "kit" and medicines came all right and was greatly appreciated, the shoes  especially. Our friends also remem- bered us in a very liberal manner. God bless you all for yonr kindness.   August 13. It has never reached me, nor have other letters for the same  month. But I think, probably, I will get them yet, when we can go for onr mail.   Kapule has arrived from the Sandwich Islands. He got here Aug. 13th, and has been here ever since. He has sold all that he had on the Sandwich Is- lands (some $3000 worth of property) and when he is released from his mis- sion he intends to go to Utah. It will  be quite a task for him to get the language, but he is stndying diligently and will soon be able to talk some I  think.   went to the island of Tutnila for a week's missionary trip. Two days af- terward Manoa sent me word that there was great exitement on Annuu through word having reached there to the effect that the governor of Tntuila had received orders from the Germans to have me and all those who had joined the Church arrested and taken to Apia. He thonght I had better re- turn immediately. Not wishing to do so until I had visited the settlements or villages that I desired to, I sent back word where I would be each day until I returned, and that if any officer wanted me they were to direct him where to find me. I was inclined to  think the thing was all a canard at  first, but subsequent investigation has shown that there was considerable  foundation for the report. Of course you are aware that the Germans have been dictating affiars here for a year or two past. A German named Bran- daus has been prime minister to the King. His salary was $250 per month, the king's $25, and the Chinaman cook's $30. This Brandans having heard that we were here and meeting with considerable snccess, sent word to the governor of Tutuila and Aunun to proclaim on the two islands that if, after the proclamation, any Samoan should join the Church he should be imprisoned. That was the foundation upon which the first rumors we heard were founded. A week or so after the governor started to "proclaim;" he had not got many miles from home be- fore a vessel arrived from the capital bringing word that the natives on the island of Upoln had taken up arms against the government and over- thrown it, and had chosen Mataala as king. The governor said if that was the case he would return, for if the government were overthrown he was governor no longer. And that was the last we have heard of the matter, of- ficially.   to Upolu, and has consisted of three battles in which the rebels have been victorious. Both parties are still in arms and which way it will finally be decided depends upon the action of the great powers, Germany and America. Since the scare started, that  is, that those who joined the Church  would be arrested, we have had but one application for baptism, and that a young boy. A good many are believ- ing, but they are afraid the Germans will return to power and that the threat will be carried out. They say there is no need for hurrying, and they will wait and see how things turn out. When the war is over and things quiet down again, if the German's retain their grip (which they are almost sure to do I am afraid) and the natives are still afraid of being arrested, I think I shall go to the capital and begin work right at headquarters, and thereby sound the thing to the bottom and see what  they will do. I can bear anything bet- ter than nncertainty. I feel certain that the Lord will overrule it all for good. We have received quite an ex- tensive advertizing as it is.   work yet outside of this little island for several reasons. Having some forty souls here that have accepted my testimony and joined the Church, I  thought it foolish to leave them in ig- norance and rnn to hunt other bap- tisms, until I could ground them snfficiently in the faith that they could stand alone, or until some one could come and take my place. My  policy has always been to labor as hard to keep a member as to get a new one and not to spread my wings over more eggs than I can keep warm. And  to carry the hen comparison a little further, I can assure yon it has kept me busy "clucking aud scratching" to  keep my little brood straight. Another reason is that I have had to get the  language, which I bave not yet ac- complished by considerable, having been here but a little over four montbs, and I have also been working with the  natives building us a meeting house.   been working every day together on it, and finally got it finished last Saturday. It is 36 x 18 feet and very comfortable  and commodious, and we all feel proud of it. The roof is of thatch- work of cocoanut leaves. The posts are ronnd cocoanut trees with the bark hewn off and the floor is covered with clean white coral pebbles from the beach with a good sprinkling of sea shells among them. I made a  stand by hewing a large cocoanut tree flat on one side and placing it flat side up on two posts firmly planted in the  ground. I made it as nice as I could with a hatchet and an old jack plane that Manoa has.   furnitnre, and he ought to know hav- ing worked in Brother Dinwoodey's  store. In commemoration of the  completion of the house, we had a feast last Saturday, and then an  entertainment, which was quite cred- itably rendered, and pleased the na- tives immensely. It consisted of hymns by us missionaries. Xylophone and violin solos by Elder Beesley, speeches, etc., and songs in Hawaiian.   first Conference. All the missionaries were present, also all the Saints that could come. We sang hymn 64, Sa- moan Church of England hymn book,  beginniug with the words "Ua tele le Alofa."  I offered prayer and dedi- cated our new meeting house to the  Lord. The missionaries then sang "Come, come ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear." I explained to the peo- ple the nature of a conference as held semi-annually in the church, and then presented the Anthorities of the Church, and all voted to sustain them  with their faith and prayers.   was then read, which is as follows:   October 6, 1888   Elders, 2.

Thus ended our first confer- ence on the Samoan Islands.   and the new missionaries settled, I now feel justified in leaving Aunuu in charge of Brothers Lee, Kapule and  Manoa, and taking Elders Beesley and Wood with me and Paloga to make a thorough canvass and circuit of Tu- tuila.

He has been financially embarrassed, how- ever, for some time, and can therefore not help us financially.  We would feel much better in a honse of our own.  There is no use thinking of making this little island our perma- nent headquarters, however.  There is no land to be gotten.  We are 78  miles from supplies and mail connec- tions, and a way from the great body of the natives.  What we need is a few acres of ground in some good situation on the island of Upolu, where we  could build our own honses and grow our own food and be near mail con- nections aud base of supplies.  But these things will have to be developed in the future as circumstances permit. As yet I am single handed and alone, practically, being the only one that can speak the language.  It will take two or three years to get things well started, as the brethren have to have time to get the langnage, and we have to take things as we find them and make the best of them.   we are engaged, and there seems to be a lively and energetic spirit among all the missionaries.  On account of the  unsettled condition of affairs on the islands I don't think it wonld be wise for any more missionaries to come at present, though a dozen Elders with  the language could be used to good  advantage.   fectionate regards.

ENDENTRY    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:   reported you and others in authority in your Church as giving utterance to  the sentiment that the Mormon people ought to divide upon national party lines, according to the political senti- ments which each man might entertain, without interference in any way from officials of your Church in that mat- ter. Frequently has that utterance been given, and the public has come to rely upon it as fixed and final. Now, however, this feeling of safety from Church interference in poli- tics has been disturbed, and a fresh source of unrest introduced by a report which appeared in the  morning of your remarks yesterday at Provo. The report was made by a man in complete sympathy with yourself so far as Church affairs go, and who, it is certain, would refuse to misreport you in any way. Subsequent inquiry develops that he is confident in the accuracy of his report of your remarks as he under- stood them. The portion of that report which causes uneasiness is the following:   should have nothing to say about politics," he continued. "I picked up a paper this morning saying that we had no business to meddle in politics. We have a right to lead the people in  spiritual and temporal affairs. We have the same rights of leadership that President Joseph Smith had. In temporal affairs? Yes. In  political affairs? Yes. We have a right to ad- vise both Democrats and Republicans to lead a  pure campaign. We have a right to say to the people that they must be pure in politics as well as in temporal affairs. We have thou- sands of children growing to manhood in Zion. I am interested in their welfare, and I would like to see them brought up under proper in- fluences, and not under the influence of such a campaign as we had two years ago."   tain with exactness,   cisely as reported, and, if not, wherein they depart from precision.   ed, then in what sense do you wish them to be understood: whether as a claim to control the political actions of your people absolutely, or only as a citizen to advise the right.   your remarks that the Church authorities claim the right to direct the people in their business and politics, and, in gen- eral, their temporal affairs, as well as spiritual. It is desirable to know whether this claim is really made and insisted upon at this time, and is to be in the future, while the public has been led to believe that claim a thing of the past. Most respectfully,   ENDENTRY    tion in your note, I have to say that I  believe the extract you quote from your  report of my remarks at Provo is sub- stantially correct.   control of the political actions of our  people absolutely" is not set up as a claim in my remarks, and I certainly would not  wish them to be so understood. I hold  that it is the right of the Priesthood  to advise at any and all times and under any circumstances those who pro- fess to respect its powers, in all  matters pertaining to their tem- poral welfare and their spiritual sal- vation; if in the matter of politics,  that the Latter-day Saints should be  governed by pure principles, and in po- litical affairs should realize and act upon  their responsibilities as Saints and  citizens. This is not to claim the right to advise them how or for whom they  should vote, or which party they should  join. We emphatically and sincerely  approved the division of the Mormon  people on party lines, and we recognize  every man's agency and respect his  right to choose in these matters for  himself. We have not advised, and do  not advise our people how they shall  vote; the elections that have been held in this Territory since politics on na- tional party lines was introduced, are  proof of this policy; we have asked no Republican to vote the Democratic tick- et, and no Democrat to vote the Repub- lican ticket; we have never advised men to vote other than their convictions  prompted them, and have no intention  of giving such advice. At the same  time, we claim the right, both as indi- viduals and as leaders of the Church, to  counsel our people to keep aloof from the corruption, the scandal and the filfth  of politics as too frequently practiced in  the world, to set an example in this as  in other things, and it is in this sense  that I wish to be understood as as- serting the right of the Priesthood to give counsel in political affairs. As citizens  we have the right of opinion and of  speech; we also have responsibilities and  duties to ourselves and to others; but until the foregoing can be construed as meddling in politics, I shall be unable to find ground for the uneasiness of which  you speak. However, in the light of this statement of my meaning and views, I trust there can be no further cause of  anxiety or unrest; I assure you there is no foundation for it.   WILFORD WOODRUFF.

ERASTUS SNOW, FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS,   ENDENTRY    OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,      of Wards   1891, acting under our advice and  direction, an association was formed consisting of some twenty-seven per sons (for the most part, sons of the  Pioneers), with ourselves as an advis- ory board, for the purpose of attending  to the detail work of the erection of a  monument to the Pioneers of Utah  and their distinguished leader, Presi- dent Brigham Young. This associa- tion immediately entered upon its  duties. A contract was entered into  with Mr. C. E. Dallin, a young  man born in this Territory who  had already attained an enviable repu- tation as a sculptor, to perform the  work in accordance with designs made  by him and fully approved by us.  These designs provided for the erection  of a monument 35 feet in height upon  a granite pedestal which is to consist  of the following conspicuous features:  The sitting figures of an American  Indian and a Rocky Mountain trapper  in bronze 8 feet in height, illustrative  of the primitive conditions which ex isted in this region before the advent of the Pioneers; a Pioneer group con- sisting of a man 8 feet in height, wo- man, child and wagon, or prairie  schooner, to be cut in relief work upon a marble shaft, or column, forming the  central feature of the monument; the  whole to be surmounted by a bronze  statue of President Brigham Young,  10 feet in height. The statue of Pres- ident Young has been completed and  was on exhibition at the World's Fair  in Chicago in 1893, where it received widespread commendation both for the faithfulness of the likeness and as a  work of art. It is now inside the  Temple Block in this city and ready to be put in place. Models of the In- dian and trapper have been executed  and approved, and are ready to be re- produced in bronze as soon as the neces- sary funds can be raised. A model of the  Pioneer group has been submitted by the  sculptor and as soon as approved can  be cut in stone and made ready to be  put in position. The site determined  upon for the monument is the south- east corner of the Temple Block, near  the spot where President Young stood  when Utah was but a wilderness, and  uttered the prophetic words: "Here  we will build the temple of our God."   For all of the work above described put in position complete and for super- intendence of construction of the  monument, the sculptor, under the  contract, is to receive $25,000. Only  a few hundred dollars have as yet been  subscribed and paid in.   conditions you will see how necessary  it is that immediate steps be taken to  raise funds for this important work.  It is our hope that by next fall, in time  for the semi-annual conference, the monument may be dedicated and un- veiled to the vision of the people who  shall have contributed to build it; and there is no reason why our expecta tions in this regard may not be fully  realized if all the people will but take  hold and push the project with the same determination and unanimity of purpose which have builded our tem- ples and accomplished so much in the  past.   the Pioneers entered this valley. Most  of those whose dauntless courage and  hardy prowess beat down the barriers  which opposed them in that historic  march of a thousand miles of trackless wilderness, overcome at last with the  fatiques of added years, have lain  their weary bodies down to rest within the tomb where sleep the brave and the just. We who remain are reaping the golden grain of their sowingâ€”are  blessed with the results of their energy  and toil. Is it not fitting that we should  cheerfully and gratefully contribute towards the erection of a monument  that will perpetuate down through the  ages the memory of the hardships and  privations they endured for us? It is  the intention to have a complete roster of that illustrious band of Pioneers en- graven upon the main column of the  monument, just as their noble deeds  ought to be and are engraven forever  upon the hearts of their posterity.   and varied calls for donations for  worthy purposes from the people, but  it is our desire that this call shall  be given first place and other consid- erations of a public nature be regarded  as secondary until the work in  hand shall be completed. Heber  M. Wells, secretary of the  Brigham Young memorial fund,  Salt Lake City, is authorized to receive  subscriptions, and he will take pleasure  in issuing a receipt in the name of every contributor, no matter how  small the sum. We extend an invita- tion, through the Presidency of the  various stakes and Bishops of wards, to  every man, woman and child through- out our mountain home to contribute  something in commemoration of the  Pioneers and their great leader, Presi- dent Brigham Young, whose genius  has left its impress in every part of this favored land. Remember that no  amount, however small, will be refused, as the purpose in view is to have a  monument that will belong to the  people who love and revere the mem- ory of the Pioneers.   steps for the furtherance of this work  in your respective stakes and wards,  and praying the Lord to bless your  labors and those of the righteous everywhere in the upbuilding of His  purposes, we remain,     GEORGE Q.

ENDENTRY      ference of the Y.M.M.I.A., much  instruction was given, relating to the  organization and government of the  Associations, which you no doubt heard or have since read. Pursuant to these  instructions and with a view to harmo- nizing the labors of all officers and  members during the approaching sea- son, we feel it opportune to direct your  attention to some points that are de- serving your especial consideration. In  the first place, we would like the officers to read the lectures and addresses that  were delivered at the conference. (They  can be found complete in the June and  July numbers of THE CONTRIBUTOR.)  If you carefully read and reflect upon these, you will better understand the  import of this communication.   as convenient, it is expected that the  officers of each Association will get to- gether in council, arrange for the time of  holding meetings and call the members of their respective Associations together.   At the first meeting the old roll will be  called, and the names of those who  answer present entered as the com- mencement of the new roll for the year.   Other names will be entered as they  come in at subsequent meetings. The  present officers will continue in office  until such time as appointments are  made by the Stake Superintendency, for  the annual election in each Asssociation  when others may be chosen, if a change  is thought desirable. At your first meet- ings you should lay before the Associa- ENDENTRY  posed for the season; and you will be aided in doing this, by reference to the conference lectures. The President and  his Counselors, constituting the pro- gramme committee, should be prepared at the first meeting to announce ap- pointments for the next, so that no un- necessary delay may occur. As a basis for the earlier programmes, we suggest that you draw from the subjective Scrip- tural headings, published in the ninth volume of THE CONTRIBUTOR. In the  November number of the Magazine,  subjective titles to Doctrinal, Historical,  Scientific and other subjects will be given, from which you will make assign- ments for brief lectures to be delivered  in your regular meetings.   portance of thorough organization and  mutual effort, not only for the improve- ment of those who voluntarily join with  you, but for the reformation of those  who are indifferent. This is your mis- sion; to look after the young men of  your respective wards: and we wish it  understood that the counsel of the Priesthood is that every young man in  Zion should join and take part in these Associations. You will please see that  this message is delivered to as many as  possible. We hope that you will make the influence of the Associations felt this  season, more than heretofore, in the  saving of the wayward. As officers, you should feel an anxiety for the refor- mation of such, and be found extending the helping hand. The Associations are  also appealed to, to improve the tone of  our social parties, and to popularize the  observance of counsel as to the regula- tions to be observed in them.   ness and idle conversation indulged in by our young men, which you can do  much to correct. Place the books of the Mutual Improvement Association Course  of Reading in the hands of as many of  the young men as you can get to take them, and encourage conversation upon the subjects they treat of. Especially we  would advise that you do not neglect the  crowds of young men and boys, who  loiter upon the streets or congregate  about the stores, the sunny sides of the  meeting houses, barns and other places in the winter, and indulge in levity and  vulgar conversation. Try and break up  such gatherings, by persistently leading into habits of reading, as many of their  number as you can influence. This  Course of Reading, which we have  adopted, is designed to help you in the  work of interesting and saving the young.   It should be taken up by every officer  and member and pursued faithfully to  the end. You can make this a great success; but it will depend upon your  interest in it, as manifested by your  energy in advocating and example in  pursuing it. If you do not take these books and read them you cannot expect  others to. We desire your prompt and  cheerful assistance to introduce this  Course of Reading, and rely upon your  support to maintain it.   the employment of your time and means; but if you, the representative young men of Zion, are not interested  in them, how do you expect that Zion  will be established? Our testimony is,  that the time has come for the young  men of Israel to give serious attention  to the reformation of their lives, and to  the improvement of their minds. The  Lord requires this, and as His servants, we enjoin it upon you. We shall watch  with deep interest the work of the  Associations, during the coming season,  and shall take occasion to promote it, by  our counsel, as opportunity is presented.   Be energetic and faithful and the Lord will be with you. We shall pray for you continually that you may be pros- pered and blessed, in the name of  Jesus.         ENDENTRY  DENCY.

In order for me to comply with such a re- quest my communication must of neces- sity be exceedingly brief, to be suit- able for an article in a magazine like the CONTRIBUTOR.   father's name was Aphek Woodruff. My mother's name was Beulah Thompson. She had three sons; Azmon, born November 29th, 1802; Ozem Thompson, born December 22nd, 1804; Wilford, born March 1st, 1807. All three are living at this date;* Azmon, at my farm house in Farmer's Ward; Ozem Thompson, at Daysville, Oswego County, New York; but he is nearly blind. I am still living in Salt Lake City. My mother died June 11th, 1808, at Avon, Connecticut, aged twenty-six years, leaving me fifteen months old. My father was a miller, as was also his father before him, which occupation I followed until 1832.   upon religion, although I did not make any profession thereof until 1830. I did not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find any denomination whose teachings, faith and practice agreed with the ordinances and gifts of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by Him in His day and time. Although the ministers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordi- nances which the ancient Saints enjoyed were done away and were no longer needed, I did not believe it to be true, only as they were done away through  the unbelief of the children of men. I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another, when God had a Church upon the earth, and a people who would obey His ordinances as in ancient days. I believed the Church of God would be re-established upon the earth, and that I should live to see it. These principles were riveted  upon my mind, from the perusal of the Old and New Testament, and with fer- vent prayer that the Lord would show  me what was right and what was wrong, and lead me in the path of salvation without any regard to the opinions of men.   the Lord for a space of three years taught me that the Lord was about to set up His Church and Kingdom in the earth, in the last days, in fulfilment of promises made by ancient prophets and apostles who spoke as they were moved upon by the inspiration of Almighty God. While in this state of mind I went with my brother Azmon to Richland,  Oswego County, New York. We bought a farm and commenced business. In December, 1833, two Mormon Elders, viz. Elijah Cheney, came into our town and stopped at our house. Elder Pulsipher said he was commanded by the Spirit of the Lord to go into the north country, and he and Elder Cheney had walked from Fabins  deep snows, and our house was the first place he felt impelled to stop at. He appointed a meeting at the schoolhouse which I attended, and on hearing him preach I felt that his sermon was the first gospel sermon I had ever heard in my life. I invited these Elders home and spent the night in conversation and in reading the Book of Mormon. I was thoroughly convinced it was a true rec- ord of the word of God. My brother Azmon and myself offered ourselves for baptism, and on the thirty-first day of December, 1833, Elder Pulsipher went with us to the creek and baptized us, with two other persons, we being the first baptized in Oswego County; eight   Azmon, departed this life, at my farm house, on Monday, the fourteenth of January, 1889, at 10:26 o'clock p.m., aged eighty-six years, one month and fifteen days. The funeral services were held at the Farmer's Ward Meeting House, at 11 o'clock a.m., Wednesday, January 16th, after which, his mortal remains were consigned to the tomb.â€” ENDENTRY  ing. Trust in the Lord of Hosts, give your hearts to God, and fail not in your mission of Improvement. Be watchful, prayerful, obedient; for the eyes of heavenly hosts are upon you. Honor your parents, that your days may be many. Venerate those grown gray in the service of the God of heaven and earth, and the ordinances of the Gospel shall be your portion, the salvation of God your part, and the Holy Priesthood with the powers thereof your inherit- ance. A great work is before you. Thrust in your sickles and reap, for the harvest is ripe, though laborers are few. Be not satisfied, rest not content until every young man professing the name of Saint in Zion is enrolled in the cause of Mutual Improvement.   evil and corrupting influences is sweep- ing the land with temptations calculated to lead the young into paths of vice and destruction.

The general authorities of the Church and those of the Wards and Stakes throughout Zion will give you encourage- ment and help whenever and wherever needed.   Young Men's Mutual Improvement As- sociations may be held in the Stakes throughout Zion at such times and places as may be determined by the Stake Presidency and Superintendency of the Associations. These conferences may occupy two days, including one Sunday, and should be made occasions for re- ceiving reports and giving mutual in- structions that will tend to harmonize the manner of conducting the Associations and achieving the most satisfactory re- sults.   tions will be held about the first of June, 1888, and annually thereafter, the exact date and place to be hereafter named by the General Superintendency. The Associations should endeavor to con- tinue their regular weekly meetings until about the time of the Annual Con- ference, before taking their summer va- cation. At the general conference statis- tical and other necessary reports will be required and time given for the consid- eration of the best means and methods of promoting the education and welfare of the young men and women of Zion.   organizations, Mutual Improvement Asso- ciations, and Relief Societies have been instituted for a wise purpose. They are "helps and governments" calculated in their nature and design to accomplish much good among Saints. Each has a special field of usefulness not occupied by the others, and no man in this Church, filled with the Holy Ghost, will lay a straw in the way of either of them. Neither will he find occasion for manifes- tations of petty jealousies, by which to foster one at the expense of another.   and almost universally come to occupy the forenoon of each Sabbath.

An appropriate time has been chosen on which to hold your first General Annual Conference, for it is eminently befitting that the young men of Israel should thus honor the illustrious statesmen, colonizer and Prophet Brigham Young, by holding their conference meetings on a day so near the anniversary of his birth. He was inspired to organize the Mutual Im- provement Associations throughout Zion. With delight you can revere his memory; for distrust of the young men of Israel  never marred his great mind. In them he had unbounded confidence, and for them unlimited love. The Almighty endowed him with the faculty of reading men more accurately and more thorough- ly than most people read books. The study of human hearts and the analyses  of human minds enabled him to distin- guish between the good and the bad. By the inspiration of the Holy Spirit frauds stood rebuked, while sincere rejoiced in his presence, and were comforted by his love. Noting the yearly harvest of death, and comprehending as few men comprehend the magnitude of the great work in which we are engaged, he fully sensed the responsibility that must ultimately rest upon you in bearing to a victorious consummation the Church and Kingdom of God.   ed to his confidence and esteem has produced the bloom preceding the growth and ripening of glorious fruit. Following in his counsels you will not disappoint his anticipations, for you are building upon a foundation resting upon eternal principles. Continue faithful to the covenants made with the Lord and each other; give your hearts to God, and listening ears to the counsels of His Holy Priesthood, and when the storms beat upon you and the house you are building neither shall fall.   earnestly beseech you to avoid the snares of worldly ambition. Enter not the gates of pride, within which selfishness weaves nets to bind the soul. Write upon them the words inscribed over Dante's Inferno â€”"Abandon hope all who enter here." Thirst for the honors and praises of men and undue love for the things of this world are dangerous reefs, upon which many have wrecked their hopes of eter- nal life. Pride, wearing the garb of hu- mility, often prays devoutly, preaches eloquently; but dwellers in heaven are as little children, of whom the youth of Zion should be as an advanced classâ€” beautiful type of saintly humility and unsuspicious innocence.   and over-reaching ambition come of him who wrought rebellion in heaven, sowed strife on earth, and trailed the serpent through human hearts. Mocking infidel- ity, atheistic boasts and sneering skep- ticism are products of a power that reigns in hell, because it would not serve in heaven. Light and life, peace and puri- ty, humility and homage, goodness and grace, come of God. Misery and mourning, pride and presumption, dark- ness and death, come of Satan.

I held the office of a Teacher one year, the office of a Priest one year; the office of an Elder one year; the office of a Seventy two years; and have held the office of an Apostle forty-eight years.

I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean four times, have held 4191 meet- ings, and preached 3250 discourses. Through my instrumentality the Lord added to the Church in 1840, in the south of England, one thousand eight hundred souls, in eight months' labors, among whom were nearly two hundred preachers of the various sects. Fifty of the preachers belonged to the United Brethren, who had broken off from the Wesleyan Methodists. This society of United Brethren numbered six hundred, all of whom were baptized, except one person. I baptized one thousand of these one thousand eight hundred. The others were baptized by Priests and  Elders whom I had ordained.   seventy-seven preaching places, organ- ized fifty-one branches of the Church, confirmed 3343 members of the Church, ordained one Apostle, and united in ordaining eight others. I have ordained twenty-three Patriarchs, and assisted in ordaining eighty-four others. I have  ordained ninety-three High Priests. I have ordained twenty-four High Coun- cilors, and assisted in ordaining seventy- four others. I have ordained fifty-seven Seventies, and six hundred and sixty- seven Elders, and assisted in ordaining four thousand three hundred and forty- seven Elders. I have ordained twenty- three Bishops and seventeen counselors to Bishops. I have ordained four hun- dred and forty-six Priests, sixty-six Teachers, and fifteen Deacons.

ENDENTRY  to the gate of perfection.   and gaze upon the world's magnificence, pride and pomp; then trace the gleams of light along the way in which faithful Elders, prayerfully and earnestly, follow the lowly Nazarene to realms of heaven- ly glory. Note carefully the faith by which they endure earthly tribulations,  in order to gain heavenly crowns. Pa- tiently and faithfully do they bear their message amid the scorn of mocking mobs. Over lands and over seas they carry the Gospel, seeking not to save their lives lest they lose them. Taking no heed of the morrow, they travel without purse or scrip, trusting in God, and receiving, as did their Master, the contempt of the world. What shall be their reward? Peace here, exaltation hereafter! Ministers of Christ here, ru- ling princes and reigning kings hereafter! Lives eternal shall be their reward; for thus do they come to know God the Fa- ther and Jesus whom He hath sent.   while deathless woe oppresses the heart, mothers may forget their nursing babes, but He who notes the sparrow's fall, will not forget His covenant chil- dren, though in infinite wisdom, as a test of faith, He permits pride to mock and insolence to deride, while persecution grinds and kills; but death and the grave will be conquered, when the King of Glory wins the ultimate victory at the very gates of hell. Down into its bowels did He descend, thence led cap- tivity captive, and gave gifts to men.   of the wrath of devils and men, gained He the keys of death, hell and the grave. They were forged in the crucible of in- tense hate, not in the lap of luxurious ease. Ingratitude heaped upon Him the sins of the world, and heavy-eyed watch- men slept while he prayed and sweat  great gouts of blood. Malice spat in his face; Jealousy in mockery crowned him with thorns; Envy mantled him with a cast-off robe; Cruelty nailed Him to the  cross, then cried: "Come down, save thyself." Son of God, Prince of Power, commander of heavenly legions though He was, the anguish of accumulated woes, caused Him, as death's agony bathed his brow, to exclaim: "My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?"   bear patiently the mocking scorn of un- belief. Taunting skepticism may deride your faith while sneeringly laughing at your confidence in God. But remember that the power to bear humiliation is the test of humility. "There must needs be offences, but woe unto them by whom they come!" The exiled and imprisoned may bear contempt; and while earthly powers hold high carnival and mock at sacred things, the promises of God may seem to fail; but you who are wise will know that the methods of Satan have never changed. Pride, haughtiness, re- bellion, oppression, deceit, rule and ruin have ever been characteristic of the fallen son of the morning. On the mountain top he offered the Christ of God the kingdoms of this world as the price of false worship. Treachery lurked deep when he sought to kill by tempting the Lord to cast Himself down from the  Temple pinnacle; then sneeringly asked that bread be made of stones to satisfy hunger gnawing at famishing vitals. As then, so nowâ€”Who lives godly in Jesus Christ shall suffer persecution. 'Tis the heritage of Saints. As they hated the Master, so will they hate His servants. Be not surprised, therefore, if for a time, humiliation, contempt and scorn be your part; for even while the hand of God traced on the palace wall the doom of the mocking king, the proud in drunken revel defiled the sacred cups of the Temple; but how quickly followed the fall! Boasting Assyrian hosts, declaring there was no God, reveled in sight of the walls of Jerusalem; but the angel of death passed over and wrapt them in dreamless sleep, that knew no mortal wakening.   tory; trust the Lord, and place honor and truth above the price of gold, and earth- ly tribulations shall polish jewels that God will set in frames of endless joy. Permit not the illusive interests of this ENDENTRY  and on the second of January, 1834, Elder Pulsipher organized a branch of the Church with twelve members, and ordained my brother Noah Holten Elders, and myself a Teacher. This was the commencement of my asso- ciation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   with the leaders of the Church in all their history, until the present day. I traveled with Joseph Smith and company known as Zion's Camp, from Clay County, Missouri, upwards of one thous- and miles. I wrote a good portion of the history of that important event. The experience gained in traveling with the Prophet of God in the company of two hundred and five, mostly young men, was of great benefit to those who were disposed to make a right use of their experience. On my arrival in Clay County I took up my abode at Lyman Wight's, with Milton Holmes, Judge Elias Higbee and some of the Whitmers. I attended the meet- tings of the Prophet Joseph while he was in Clay County, organizing the Presi- dency of that Stake of Zion and appoint- ing David Whitmer as President.   er, and knowing for myself that the ful- ness of the Gospel of Christ, which God had revealed to Joseph Smith, was true, I had a great desire to preach it to the inhabitants of the earth, but as a Teacher I had no authority to preach the gospel to the world. I went into the forest near Lyman Wight's, one Sunday evening, aside from the abodes of men, and made my desire known unto the Lord. I prayed that the Lord would open my way and give me the privilege of preach- ing the gospel. I did not make my re- quest expecting any honor from man, for I knew that the preaching of the gospel was attended with hard labor and per- secution. While I was praying, the spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and testified to me that my prayer was heard, and that my request would be granted. I arose to my feet and walked some three hundred yards into a broad road rejoic- ing. As I came into the road I saw Judge Elias Higbee standing before me. As I walked up to him he said, "Wilford, the Lord has revealed to me that it is your duty to go into the vineyard of the Lord and preach the gospel." I told him if that was the will of the Lord I was ready to go. I did not tell him that I had been praying for that privilege. I had been boarding at Lyman Wight's with Judge Higbee for months and it was the first time he had ever named such a thing to me.   Lyman Wight's, Clay County, Missouri, November 5th, 1834, I was ordained a Priest, by Elder Simeon Carter and Bishop Edward Partridge appointed Elder Henry Brown and myself a mission to the Southern States. On the thirteenth of January 1835, I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight, as having  performed my duties faithfully in Zion's Camp, and Elder Henry Brown and myself started upon our mission. We crossed into Jackson County and bowed our knees upon that land and returned thanks to the Lord, prayed for His pro- tection from the hands of wicked men and mobs, and went on our way re- joicing. I started upon this my first mission in life without purse or scrip to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We traveled through Jackson County, living mostly upon parched corn until we got out of the county. We spent one night with Mr. Jerew, the Indian trader, on the Osage river. The next day we walked sixty miles and lay on the floor of a house without anything to eat, and walked next morning twelve miles before getting breakfast, making seventy-two miles travel without food. We passed into Arkansas Territory and spent several weeks at Petty John Creek, where we passed through a very singu- lar experience with Mr. Alexander Ake- man and others, -a full statement of which is published in the eighteenth number of Vol. eight of the  News tree, and in two days dug out a canoe four feet wide and twelve feet long, and rowed down the Arkansas river one ENDENTRY  no servant of God humbly trying to do his duty will seek to encroach.   the Mutual Improvement Associations, is a medium of instruction and enlighten- ment. How, except by judicious exer- cises of the faculties shall we develop the talent with which the Creator may have endowed us? Few things, if any, are calculated to strengthen the mind and give it powers of concentration more than the frequent use of the pen, in writing for publication. And what agency is more potent for good than the press? THE CONTRIBUTOR, whose articles are largely furnished by home authors, is a magazine of which all Israel have reason to be proud. Its circulation should be widely extended, and to this end we in- vite the co-operation of all Saints. The editor, Brother Junius F. Wells, has been singularly blessed in his management of the magazine heretofore. His selec- tion and arrangement of matter have been remarkably fortunate, and the Lord has been with him in his responsible labors.   cellence reached, it should be our con- stant effort to improve, and the young men and women of talent among us can do great service in this direction, by fur- nishing regular contributions to the magazine. To this desirable end we very respectfully invite their hearty co- operation.   be established throughout Zion, and lectures on various subjects should be encouraged. Thus may you become acquainted with the customs, laws and language of various countries, while seeking to graduate in the science of all other sciencesâ€”correct theology. In this connection we would suggest that it will be well in all the Stakes for the Associations to take the initiative in es- tablishing libraries and reading rooms. This is a labor peculiarly adapted to our organization and has been enjoined upon us from the beginning. We deprecate any disposition on the part of our young men, especially those who have had superior opportunities for acquiring an education, to draw away from the Im- provement Associations, and to form among themselves separate societies of an exclusive nature. Would it not be better if they would lend their talent and  efforts to make the Improvement Associ- ations more successful? There is no worthy object they can desire to attain that the Improvement Associations do not contemplate and hope to reach. We, therefore, ask the co-operation of all such young men, and trust that it will be gladly given, as we feel sure the results of a united endeavor under proper organiza- tion and direction will be most satisfac- tory.   knowledge seek wisdom. In all your efforts to improve seek to know God and Jesus, whom He hath sent, for in that knowledge is found life eternal. The Holy Priesthood that you bear is the key to unlock that door. See that you do not misuse it and thereby fail. "Ask and ye shall receive. Knock and it shall open."   ence, we trust that you will carry with  you the Spirit thereof and renewed determination to labor diligently and earnestly for improvement in the interest of purity and holiness. Remembering always the reason for the hope within you, make the love of God and of your fellows the foundation of your work; and moving forward steadily and prayerfully and earnestly, you cannot fail in accom- plishing that which brings peace, happi- ness and salvation.   serve, guide and prosper you in all your works of love, we remain,   Mutual Improvement.

ENDENTRY  Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have also held the keys of the dead of my father's house, and, through the mercy of God and the assistance of my friends, I  have been enabled to redeem some three thousand souls of the Woodruff, Hart and Thompson families, through  the ordinances for the dead, for which I  feel to praise the Lord. For as Paul says: Why are you baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?   from my journal, which is only a limited account of the labors of one man out of  thirty Apostles, one hundred and fifty Patriarchs, some five hundred High Priests, five thousand Seventies and twenty thousand Elders, besides the Lesser Priesthood, and two hundred thousand members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now, with these reflections resting upon my mind, and knowing that the work and labor in the Church and Kingdom of God will augment and increase from this time forth with greater rapidity than it has ever done, until the coming of the Son of man, and thoroughly compre- hending the fact that myself, with many of the leading men and fathers in Israel will soon pass to the other side of the  veil, my spirit is ready to cry out, "Where, O where, O Lord, is the material which thou hast ordained to step forth and take our places and the places of the fathers in Zion, to take the Church, the Zion and Kingdom of God, and bear it off triumphant, and prepare it as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, for the coming  of the great Bridegroom?" I will confess that I know not where to look for this element, if it is not to be found in the  young men who dwell in these moun- tains of Israel. I am satisfied it can not be found anywhere else upon the face of the whole earth.   standing boldly before my face, what can I say to my young friends, young  brothers, young men of Zion? You are stepping forth into manhood as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints. Many of you are already bearing the holy Priesthood and officiat- ing in its various offices. Many of you have parents who have labored faithfully to build up the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth, and have finished  their testimony, and to-day are in the spirit world. Many of you have parents  still living who will soon close their tes- timony and also pass away. So far as I am concerned, having reached my four score years, I do not know that I shall ever be permitted again in the flesh to meet with the young men in Zion, in the capacity of a mutual improvement asso- ciation, or in their public assemblies. So far as that is concerned, it mattereth not. But I wish I had power to express  myself as I feel to the children, to the young men and women of the Latter- day Saints, who dwell in these moun- tains. I wish the veil could be lifted from off their eyes, that they could see what lies before them, that they could see their destiny, that they could see unto what they are ordained. I wish, my young friends, that you could com- prehend the magnitude and value of the great work which the God of Heaven is about to place upon your shoulders. Could the visions of your minds be  opened to see the great work your Heavenly Father, the Father of your  spirits, ordained you to before the world  was, to enter into the flesh on the earth in the last days, and take the Kingdom of our God and bear it off triumphant, and prepare it for the coming of the Son  of Man! I say, if you could see these truths and comprehend them, you would labor with all your might, mind and strength to prepare yourselves and qual- ify yourselves, not only with the Priest- hood, but with the powers of that Priest- hood and with the power of God, to enter into the ministry and labor by faith, that you may be able to stand true and faithful to God and to your cove- nants. For you stand on the earth in the day when the judgments, wrath and in- dignation of Almighty God are about to be poured out upon the wicked of all  nations.   the light that shineth in darkness, and ENDENTRY  come, nor quench the light that should cheer even in affliction. Narrow not the sources of comfort and happiness by selfishly debasing godlike powers.

Shun, we beseech you, as you would the deadly upas, the vulgarity of unseemly struggles for place and power.   ciate with harlots outside the Temple, while they lived on the fruits of the people's labor, the Lord spoke through the boy Samuel and foretold what should result. ##1 Samuel 2-3## A few of our youth have followed the example of Eli's sons. Their course has been downward, and they have trodden the path leading to destruction. Among all your acquaint- ances think of one who, having deserted and turned away from the Lord, has gained thereby peace, happiness or  greatness. Have they not, without ex- ception, been as the moth that falls into the burning blaze? Have not those seeking the "liberty" of saloons, gamb- ling dens and the companionship of the unclean had their wings clipped in the flames of a quenchless fire?   joy, as you hope for salvation and exal- tation, go not near the haunts of vice. They allure only to destroy. Sound care- fully the causes leading to infidelity and doubt, note the actions of those who slur the things of God, and you will find that vice has stained the body and blotted the soul. The Holy Spirit of God dwells not in unclean tabernacles; and he who sins and repents not, doubts; and he who doubts is damned. Converse- ly, to him that believeth the things of God all things, whether in heaven, earth or hell, will be made possible. Go not,  therefore, into the wilderness of sin to lean upon broken reeds, but hold fast to the "rod of iron" leading to the fruits of eternal life. ##1 Nephi 8:19## While earnestly seeking for knowledge to be found in good books, bear in mind the fact that the Holy Ghost is the safest and most pro- found instructor. He will bring to your mind things past and present, and show you things to come. Seek therefore his constant fellowship, and his teachings shall make you wise, good and great, and finally lead you back into the pre- sence of your Heavenly Father.   knowledge and understanding of the world, what did the people know of the laws of God until Joseph, the boy pro- phet, came? In the midst of the glare of modern civilization and enlightenment the Bible was as a sealed book. The harmonies of the universe seemed con- fusion, while professed ministers taught the doom of everlasting damnation alike for ignorant heathens and innocent chil- dren, neither of whom had heard of Christ. Holding their dupes over the flames of an imaginative hell, they pro- claimed the hideous doctrine of non-re- demption beyond the grave. While leading redhanded murderers, all drip- ping in the blood of innocence, to the hangman's scaffold and there promising them, as they died, a free pass into the bosom of the stainless Christ, they preached the consignment of unbaptized infants forever to the regions of the  damned!   they know God and His ways? How could they measure His infinite love? An earthly father, doing with his chil- dren what they claimed God daily did with his, would have been regarded, even in the dark ages, as an unmitigated, merciless tyrant. No wonder that such dense ignorance should produce the soil of skepticism, out of which has grown infidel iconoclasts, whose intelligent shrewdness plays upon the darkness of such unholy doctrines, as electricity plays upon the blackness of night. Under their teachings the loving husband and confiding wife parted forever at the grave! How awful the thought indicated in the mocking marriage ceremony pro- claiming union only "until death do you part." Were that all, then indeed would this world and its brief joys be but a delusion and a snare! But it is not all.

When I said I was a preacher he ex- pressed his belief that I was an impostor and insisted that I should preach to a  congregation that he would gather to- gether, and they should judge whether I was a preacher or not. I spoke an hour and a quarter to a crowded house, and so many things were revealed con- cerning themselves that I do not think the same congregation will ever meet again for the same purpose. I met with Elders Warren Par- rish, in middle Tennessee and labored with them to the end of the year 1835. Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder on the twenty-eighth of June 1835. I was ordained a Seventy and enrolled as a member of the second quorum of Seven- ties on the thirty-first day of May 1836, by Elders David Patten and Warren Parrish. I traveled and preached in Tennessee from the twenty-seventh of March 1835, until the twentieth of Sep- tember 1836, at which time I was released to return to Kirtland. I organized the first company of Saints in the South to go to Far West which numbered twenty- two souls. While holding the office of an Elder in Tennessee eleven months, I traveled two thousand five hundred and thirty-seven miles, held one hundred and eighty-two meetings, baptized forty- eight, ordained two Elders, two Priests, three Teachers, eight Deacons and  blessed nineteen children. On the sec- ond of October 1836, I started for Kirt- land in company with A. O. Smoot and Jesse Turpin, and arrived at Kirtland on the twenty-fifth of October 1836, when I had a happy meeting with the Prophet, Apostles and Elders in the Temple of the  Lord. I spent the winter of 1836-7 in  Kirtland, and attended the school taught by Prof. Haws, studying English and Latin grammar. I was set apart as a  member of the first quorum of Seventies on the third of January 1837. I attended the meetings and received my washings and anointings in the Kirtland Temple in the spring of 1837. I then passed through all the troubles and stirring events of that period.   joined in marriage with Miss Phebe W. Carter, of Scarborough, Maine, at the house of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The ceremony was performed by President Frederick G. Williams, and we were blessed by the Patriarch, Father Joseph Smith. Forty-eight days from this event, on the thirty-first of May, I took the parting hand of my wife and all my friends in Kirtland and started upon a mission to Fox Islands, in the Vine Haven Bay, in the State of Maine. I was accompanied by Elder Milton Holmes and Jonathan H. Hale. On our journey we crossed Lake Ontario and visited the Saints, attended conference, administered to the sick and evil spirits were subject to us by the power of God. We continued our journey, recrossed Lake Ontario and visited Farmington, my native place, and for the first time since I had joined the Church visited my father's house. I preached the Gospel to my relatives and baptized my uncle Ozem Woodruff and his wife John. This  was in fulfilment of a dream I had when I was eight years old. On my return from Fox Islands I baptized my father, Dwight Webster, a Methodist class leader, who was boarding at my father's house. I organized a small branch of the Church of nine members, eight of whom were my relatives. I preached to a large con- gregation in the Methodist meeting house at Farmington. My wife joined me at Farmington and accompanied me to Scarborough, Maine, and we visited her father's house, it being my first visit. I was kindly received.

The introduction of this system for the purpose of forming correct  habits of reading we regarded as a very important part of the work of Mutual Improvement. While the success of the introduction has not been all that we hoped for it, we think it is because our  plan and purpose have not been fully ex- plained. We shall undertake by letter  and missionary assistance to the several stakes to make the value of this Course  of Reading known, and in the meantime  invite all the associations, which have not done so, to make an effort to take it up with as many members as possible.   objects of the associations is to secure to their members testimonies of the  Truth, we suggest that exercises designed to accomplish this be prescribed and in- sisted upon in every association.   in all our meetings, vocal music claims our attention.

We should like,  if possibe, to have a chorus from our  membership of five hundred voices to  take part in our conference next June.   speaking a few moments upon given sub- jects is one that involves previous research and reflection, and at the same time cul- tivates force and concentration in thought and speech that cannot fail to be of great  benefit to all who expect to devote a part, at least, of their lives to public  speaking.

The Lord will not disappoint this  generation in the fulfillment of His words, any more than He did in other ages. Any person who is in the posses- sion of the Spirit of God, sufficient to discern the signs of the times, can see clearly that the revelations of God in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc- trine and Covenants are being fulfilled, and they will all be fulfilled to the very letter, and to the very end. The Chris- tian Gentile world to-day are very fast rejecting the Gospel of life and salvation, sent unto them by the revelation of Jesus Christ, through the administration of angels in fulfillment of the revelations of St. John. The present crusade against the Saints in Utah, the late act of our government in yielding to the public clamor of the priest and the people, the pulpit and the press, in passing laws to take away the civil, religious and politi- cal rights from two hundred thousand Latter-day Saints because of their reli- gion; and for the rulers of this great republican government to trample under their feet the most sacred principles of the Constitution, to gratify the clamor of our persecutors, is enough to pall the heart of every reflecting mind through- out the world. Would the rulers of our  nation have taken such a step against any other people on earth, except against the Church of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God on the earth? They would not.   American government for a wise pur- pose in Himself, and gave our fore- fathers a glorious Constitution by inspira- tion, the best Constitution ever given to  a human government, as a rich legacy to be handed down to their posterity. Will not that same God hold the rulers of the nation responsible, who trample that Con- stitution under their feet and break it in pieces for the purpose of destroying a  people, who are seeking to build up the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth? He most assuredly will. Our nation by these acts is turning the last  key that will seal its condemnation and destruction. For the Lord has decreed it in revelations ever given upon this subject.   say to you that you are about to step forth upon the stage of action in the beginning of the revolution, changes, and judgments which are about to over- whelm and engulf our nation and the nations of the earth. You are bound to  take the offices, places and responsibili- ties of those whose heads are blossomed for the tomb and will soon pass away. Therefore I am anxious for you, the boys and young men in Zion, to see the necessity of beginning immediately to prepare yourselves for the work that lies before you. You are the lawful heirs to the Priesthood. The Lord has called and ordained you to His work. You need not heed the scoffs or ridicule of the persecutors of the Saints. Their un- belief will not make the truths of God of  none effect. The day is at hand when the blasphemers will hold their lips.   to lose or throw away. Solomon says there is a time for all things. I think the time has come when our young men should call upon the Lord in prayer and labor to obtain the Holy Ghost as their constant companion, and seek out of the best books, by study and by faith, to treasure up knowledge, wisdom and understanding. There is a day of mourn- ing and lamentation approaching the earth. I want the young people, as well as their parents, to be prepared for it.

Until he came, this world seemed as a black wilderness of woe, beyond which no heavenly light appeared. As the sun lights from the east to the west, so the revelations of Almighty God have penetrated our hearts and given us comprehension of earthly and heavenly things. This, or a  future generation, will produce historians whose delight it shall be to trace the effects among God's children of the mar- velous light brought in the world in our day through the instrumentality of the great modern revelator. It was indeed a startling declaration to the world when he fearlessly proclaimed that God again had spoken from the heavens! Ignorance stood amazed, while scoffing hypocrisy raged; but the work of human redemp- tion goes bravely on, while the meek  and poor and honest rejoice.   depends. Upon your shoulders the Al- mighty is rolling responsibilities the magnitude of which has never been ex- ceeded in any age. The kingdom of God revealed by Joseph will be given to no other people. It will never fall. Be ye therefore to its interest and advance- ment faithful and true.

Why should any dread its sway? Christ is the king, and has not He earned the right to the dominion and rule of His own? His kingdom is not autocratic, neither wholly theocratic. It is indeed theo-dem- ocraticâ€”the voice of God and the sanction of the people. Its laws rec- ognize everywhere the doctrine of com- mon consent. The Almighty in the beginning gave to man the right to ex- ercise his own agency. He will never deprive him of that privilege, for by no other means can he ever develop the godhead within him.

The spirit of the Lord rested upon us and testified to us that our prayers would be answered. As we arose from our prayers, a sloop came sailing into the harbor. We went to the captain and enquired where he was going. He said right through the channel to Vinal Haven. He took us on board and landed us on North Fox Island, at two o'clock in the morning. We commenced preaching in the Baptist meeting house on the twentieth of August. Brother  Hale stayed with me one month and twelve days. -The history of this mis- sion is published in full in No. 20, Vol. 8,  for Kirtland October second; I accom- panied him to Scarborough, and returned to the Island on the second of Novem- ber accompanied by my wife. I spent the winter of 1838 upon the Islands accom- panied a short time by Brother James Townshend. During my mission upon the Islands I was opposed by the Bap- tist minister, Gideon J. Newton, of the North Island, and by Elder Douglass, a Methodist minister of the South Island. Both made war upon me, but the con- gregations of both embraced the Gos- pel and I baptized most of their mem- bers. I received a letter from President Thomas B. Marsh, on the sixteenth of August, 1838, informing me that I had been called by revelation to fill a vacancy in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, in the place of one who had fallen. I had organized a company of fifty-three of those I had baptized to go to Missouri in the Fall of 1838. As they were all fishermen and knew nothing about trav- eling, I went on to the mainland and purchased horses, wagons and harness, and fitted them out for their journey, and on the fourth of October we started on our travels. We traveled through rain, mud, frost and snow with much suffering, and buried several who died on the way, arriving at Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois, on December nineteenth, where I spent the winter in providing for my family and company.   took my family and went to Quincy, Illinois.

We returned to Quincy on the second day of  May. While we were performing this journey Joseph the Prophet and his brother prison in Missouri and arrived at Quincy, where we met with them, their families and friends and had a joyous time. I accompanied President Brigham Young with our families from Quincy to Nauvoo and settled at Montrose.

None but the Elders of the true Church of Christ will preach the true Gospel of Christ. There is but one Gospel of Christ, never was and never will be but one. St. Paul said: "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." That Gospel is a gospel of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance of sins, baptism in water by immersion for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.

Brother Brigham Young paddled me across the Mississippi river in a canoe. The difficulties which I, with the rest of the Apostles, passed through in performing that journey to England will never be told in history. However, we all arrived in various com- panies in England in compliance with the commandments of God. We spent the year 1840 in England, during which time we preached the gospel and bap- tized some seven thousand, organized branches and conferences in England and London and Edinburgh. Eighteen hundred of this number were brought into the Church through my labors in Herefordshire, Worcestershire dur- ing eight months, including nearly two hundred preachers of the various denom- inations. About fifty of the preachers belonged to the six hundred of the United Brethren who were baptized into the Church. After performing this work, and on the twenty-fifth of April, 1841 I set sail for America on the ship  ter a large company of Saints, and arrived  at New York, May 20th.

I arrived at Nauvoo on the sixth of October, 1841, where I again had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophet Joseph and Apostles and my friends. I spent the winter of 1841-2 in Nauvoo, attending meetings and councils and laboring with my hands for the support of myself and family until the third of February, 1842, at which time Joseph Smith called me to take charge of the business department of the printing office, which I attended to until the twentieth of January, 1844, when I left the office well supplied with materials, in the hands of Elder John  Taylor. I received my endowments with the Twelve under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the winter of 1843. In the spring of 1844, I was ap- pointed a mission with most of the Twelve to go through the Eastern States. On the ninth of May, 1844, I took the last parting hand with President Joseph Smith in his own house with Brother Jedediah M. Grant. He blessed me and  bade me God speed, but seemed very sorrowful, as he did in parting with all of the Twelve. I have since been satis- fied that he had a presentiment that it was his last parting with his brethren of the Apostles. I attended a conference at Boston, and on the twenty-seventh of June, 1844, while at the railway depot in Boston with Elder Brigham Young wait- ing for trains to take us to Lowell, there seemed to be a dark cloud and sorrowful gloom come over us, which we could not comprehend at the time. While I was at Portland, Maine, and ready to step on board a steamer for Fox Islands I saw an account of the martyrdom of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum, and the Spirit bore record to me that it was true; so I returned to Boston, where the Twelve soon met together, and we hastened to Nauvoo, when we found the city enveloped in mourning.   ting in order the Church, a council was held, at which time I was appointed to go to England and take charge of the Church in that land. I arrived in Liver- pool on the ship,  the third of January, 1845, in company with my wife and youngest daughter; also Brothers wife, wife, and Brothers Leonard W. Hardy. I spent the year 1845 in England attend- ing to the duties devolving upon me. During that year I published three thousand copies of the Doctrine and Covenants, and secured the copyright in London, being the first European edition, three thousand Hymn Books and twenty thousand copies of the proclamation of the Apostles.

We arrived at Mount Pisgah, where there was a large body of the Saints, on the fifteenth of  June. I here found Elder Lorenzo Snow, apparently at the point of death, and administered to him. On the twenty- fifth of June I was met by Captain Allen, who had come to visit the camp of the Saints to raise a Battalion to go to war with Mexico. I directed him to the portion of the camp where President Young was, and he immediately raised the Mormon Battalion of five hundred men. I consented for every teamster I had to go to make up the number, as did others. We formed our encamp- ment for the winter on the west side of the Missouri river, which we named Winter Quarters. On the fifteenth of  October I met with a very severe acci- dent. An oak tree fell upon me and broke my breast bone and several ribs, which came near killing me; but through the administration of the Elders and the blessings of God, I was preserved. In  the Spring of 1847 I accompanied Presi- dent Young with some of the Twelve and the pioneer camp of one hundred and forty-three persons in crossing the  plains to the Great Salt Lake Valley, where we built a Fort, laid out the site of Temple Block  and returned to Winter Quarters the same season. -The history of which has been frequently published.-   and children, by appointment, and went east to Boston to gather up all the Saints in the New England States, and take them to the Rocky Mountains. I labored in this capacity until the spring of 1850, and sent out several companies. I visited all the branches of the Church  in New England and New Brunswick, and organized the last company and led them myself from Boston to St. Louis, Council Bluffs, and on to Salt Lake City, arriving in October, 1850, at which time I settled my family, including my father, in the City of Salt Lake, where I have spent the past thirty-eight years of my life, attending to the duties of my calling as an Apostle, in the building and dedi- cation of temples, administering in the  ordinances of the Gospel therein, and preaching to the Saints and providing for my family. I have been deeply inter- ested in the redemption of my dead.  Through my own labors and the assistance of my friends I have been enabled to  give endowments to some three thousand of my dead relatives of my father's and mother's house. Among other labors I have officiated as a member of the Utah Legislature for twenty-two sessions, twenty of which were in the Legislative Council.   Nevada and California.

I  have had experience and testimony suffi- cient in my life to satisfy me, beyond a  doubt, of the truth of the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to  Joseph Smith, whom the Lord raised up  to lay the foundation of His Church and  Kingdom of God upon the earth, in this the last dispensation of the fulness of  times. Mormonism, so-called, is true.  The truth of which this generation will learn when they come before God to judgment, if not before. All the revela- tions of God as proclaimed in the Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants will have their fulfilment in their appointed time. Not one jot nor  tittle will fall unfulfilled. Darkness  covers the earth and gross darkness the  people, and infidelity reigns in a great  measure among the children of men;  but the greatest infidel that lives will find a God when he gets into the spirit world, and a just Judge, who will judge all men  with a righteous judgment, and reward every one according to the deeds done in the body. Woe unto all men, who  reject the testimony of Jesus Christ  and persecute the Saints of God, no  matter in what age of the world they  may live.   you have a great destiny before you,  both in this world and in the world to come. You have a long eternity awaiting you and a great responsibility.  As your fathers are passing away the  labor of the Church and Kingdom of  God will rest upon you. I have confi- dence in you, to believe that you will  qualify yourselves for the great duty and work which lies before you. The des- tiny of the Church and Kingdom of  God in the latter days is decreed by the God of Heaven, and I do not believe that God has made that decree without  preparing an element to do His work, in  carrying out His purposes.   the Mutual Improvement Associations,  that the God of Israel has called, chosen and ordained you as messengers of life and salvation, to qualify yourselves to  prune the vineyard for the last time and  labor while it is called day and prepare for the coming of the Son of Man.   is the earnest prayer of your brother and fellow laborer in the Church and king- dom of God.

Today we enjoy the great happiness of having three of these sacred structures completed, dedicated to and accepted of the Lord, wherein the Saints can enter and attend to those ordi- nances which He, in His infinite goodness and  kindness, has revealed. But for forty years the hopes, desires, and anticipations of the entire  Church have been centered upon the comple- tion of this edifice in the principal city of Zion. Its foundation was laid in the early days of our settlement in these mountains; and from that day until the present, the eyes of the members of the Church in every land have been lovingly  directed toward it. Looking upon it as the Temple of temples, the people during all these years have labored with unceasing toil, undi- minished patience, and ungrudging expenditure of means to bring it to its present condition of  completion; and now that the toils and the sacrifices of forty years are crowned so success- fully and happily; now that the great building is at last finished and ready to be used for  divine purposes, need we say that we draw near an event whose consummation is to us as a people momentous in the highest degree? Far- reaching in its consequences, as that occasion  is certain to be, what remains for us to say in  order to impress the entire Church with a sense  of its tremendous importance?   offer a few words upon a phase that directly  touches it. No member of the Church who  would be deemed worthy to enter that sacred house can be considered ignorant of the prin- ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much to pre- sume that every one knows what his duty is to God and to his fellowman. None is so forgetful as to have lost sight of the admonition that we must be filled with love for and charity toward our brethren. And hence none can for a  moment doubt the supreme importance of every  member of the congregation being at peace with all his or her brethren and sisters, and at peace with God. How else can we hope to gain the blessings He has promised save by complying with the requirements for which those blessings  are the reward!   of God, or those who are derelict in yielding  obedience to His commands, expect that the mere going into His holy house and taking part  in its dedication will render them worthy to  receive, and cause them to receive, His blessing?   away from sin may be so lightly dispensed with?   our Father of injustice and partiality, and attrib- ute to Him carelessness in the fulfillment of His own words?   people would be guilty of such a thing.   expect a blessing from their attendance at the Temple while sin unrepented of still casts its  odor about them, and while bitterness or even an unforgiving coolness exists in their hearts  against their brethren and sisters.   be said.

In our letter of September 1st, 1891, to you we introduced the M.I. Manual, Part I. It is gratifying to know that the  Manual is proving a practical aid as was  intended. Now the next step in advance is the preparation of efficient leaders to conduct this educational work in the  various wards; and to accomplish this the MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT NORMAL COURSE OF INSTRUCTION has, upon our recom- mendation and with our endorsement,  been established in the Brigham Young  Academy, Provo, where representative young men and young women can be sent from the various stakes and wards to receive a course of teaching and train- ing that will prepare them to properly conduct the association work in their  wards on a truly educational plan, of  which theology is the base.   once with the Presidency of your Stake, and with their advice and counsel, in- struct the president of each association to confer with his Bishop, by whose ad- vice and counsel the selection of students  will be made to fill this mission.   and the tuition is free.

WELLS,  EDITOR.       been presented to the President of the  United States:     of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, beg respectfully to represent to your Excellency the following facts:   that polygamy, or celestial marriage, as commanded by God through Joseph Smith, was right; that it was a necessity to man's highest exaltation in the life to  come.   gated by our President, the late Brigham Young, forty years ago, and was steadily taught and impressed upon the Latter- day Saints up to a short time before Sep- tember, 1890. Our people are devout and sincere, and they accepted the doc- trine, and many personally embraced and practiced polygamy.   stamp the practice out, our people, al- most without exception, remained firm, for they, while having no desire to oppose the Government in anything, still felt that  their lives and their honor as men were pledged to a vindication of their faith; and that their duty towards those whose lives were a part of their own was a par- amount one, to fulfill which they had no right to count anything, not even their own lives, as standing in the way. Fol- lowing this conviction hundreds endured arrest, trial, fine and imprisonment, and  the immeasurable suffering borne by the  faithful people, no language can describe. That suffering, in abated form, still con- tinues.   franchisement to its other punishments for those who clung to their faith and  fulfilled its covenants.   Church receives, from time to time, revelations for the religious guidance of his people.   of the Church, in anguish and prayer, cried to God for help for his flock, and  received permission to advise the mem- bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, that the law command- ing polygamy was henceforth suspended.   which was held a few days later, this was submitted to the people, numbering many thousands and representing every community of the people in Utah, and was by them in the most solemn manner accepted as the future rule of their lives.   covenant made that day.   a year had passed by, the matter was once more submitted to the thousands of people gathered together, and they again in the most potential manner, ratified the  solemn covenant.   believing that the object of the govern- ment was simply the vindication of its own authority and to compel obedience to its laws, and that it takes no pleasure in persecution, we respectfully pray that full amnesty may be extended to all who are under disabilities because of the operation of the so-called Edmunds and  Edmunds-Tucker laws. Our people are scattered; homes are made desolate; many are still imprisoned; others are banished or in hiding. Our hearts bleed for those. In the past they followed our counsels, and while they are thus afflicted our souls are in sackcloth and ashes.   Union a more loyal people than the Latter-day Saints. They know no other country except this. They expect to live and die on this soil.   were in rebellion against the government, in 1865, threw down their arms and  asked for recognition along the old lines of citizenship, the Government hastened to grant their prayer. ENDENTRY  with our hearts free from guile and our souls  prepared for the edification that is promised!   Thus shall our supplications, undisturbed by a thought of discord, unitedly mount into the ears of Jehovah and draw down the choice blessings of the God of Heaven!   and in your faith as the First Presidency of the  Church, we have this to say to the Latter-day Saints, in our individual as well as our official capacity: If there is a single member of the Church who has feelings against us, we do not wish to cross the threshold of the Temple until  we have satisfied him and have removed from him all cause of feeling, either by explanation  or by making proper amends and atonement;  neither would we wish to enter the sacred por- tals of that edifice until we have sought an ex- planation, or amends, or atonement, from any against whom we may have either a real or  fancied grievance.   we say to all the other officers of the Church  that we desire them to follow our example. We  wish them from the highest to the lowest and throughout all the Stakes and Wards of Zion to take heed of this counsel. Let them invite all who may have feelings against them to come forward and make them known; let them then endeavor to correct any misapprehensions or misunderstandings which may exist, or give re- dress for any wrong or inury that may have been done.   taken the course indicated we wish them to say the sameâ€”to the individual members of the Church. We call upon them to seek to have the  fellowship of their brethren and their sisters, and  their entire confidence and love; above all to seek to have the fellowship and union of the Holy  Ghost. Let this spirit be sought and cherished as diligently within the smallest and humblest  family circle, as within the membership of the highest organization and quorum. Let it per- meate the hearts of the brothers and sisters, the parents and children of the household, as well as the hearts of the First Presidency and Twelve.  Let it mellow and soften all differences be- tween members of the Stake Presidencies and the High Councils as well as between neighbors  living in the same ward. Let it unite young  and old, male and female, flock and shepherd, people and Priesthood, in the bonds of gratitude and forgiveness and love, so that Israel may feel approved of the Lord, and that we may all come before Him with a conscience void of offense  before all men. Then there will be no disap- pointment as to the blessings promised those who sincerely worship Him. The sweet whis- perings of the Holy Spirit will be given to them and the treasures of heaven, the communion  of angels, will be added from time to time, for His promise has gone forth and it cannot fail!   endeavor to carry out this counsel, and desirous of seeing it take the form of a united effort on the part of the whole people, we suggest that  Saturday, March 25th, 1893, be set apart as a day of fasting and prayer. On that occasion  we advise that the Presidencies of Stakes, the  High Councils, the Bishops and their Counsel- ors, meet together with the Saints in their several meeting houses, confess their sins one to another, and draw out from the people all  feelings of anger, of distrust, or of unfriendliness that may have found a lodgment; so that entire  confidence may then and there be restored and  love from this time prevail through all the con- gregations of the Saints.       of Latter-day Saints.

ENDENTRY  FARMINGTON, Connecticut,      the United States, for the purpose of gathering my family and kindred with the Saints west of the Mountains, and feeling a deep interest in the welfare of the Saints at large, I have made enquiries concerning the prospects, intentions and presidency of the eastern churches, and was informed that Elder Little was appointed to take the Presidency of the eastern churches,  charter ships for their emigration, &amp;c. I have since had an  interview with Elder Little, and have seen his appointment by the Quorum of the Twelve in Nauvoo, and I feel heartily to re- commend the appointment to all the Saints, and I greatly de- sire that all will unite as the heart of one man, in sustaining him in all his operations and labors, and especially in the char- tering of ships for emigration. The Saints will find it much  to their advantage to be entirely united in their movements in the emigration. I hope and trust the day is not far distant, when all the Saints in these eastern lands, may be making pre- parations to gather with the main body, either by sea or land. Those who go by water, will go with less expense, and be ena- bled to take much more with them than they could by land.   you, and that you may be gathered together and build up Zion, is the prayer of your brother in the covenant and faith of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
