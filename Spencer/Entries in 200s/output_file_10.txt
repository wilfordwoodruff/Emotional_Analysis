 time I had ever seen him  we appointed a meeting for him to speak to our  little branch, ^He instructed [illegible] us the branch^ and we had a precious time, he spoke till near midnight. He was upon  an important mission in connexion with Lyman Wight, it was to gather up from  100 to 5000 men ^a company^ to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied Brother Pratt to Jefferson   County, I told him my circumstances. He said it was my duty to try to prepare myself   to go to Kirtland & join the Camp of Zion. According to his council I went to with  all my might & settelled all my accounts ^business^ & business and on the 11 day of April  1834 I bid my friends farewell, & took a pair of horses & waggon & took with  me Brothers Harry Brown & Warren Ingles, & started for Kirtland Ohio.  I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch, and other Elders on the way & arrived   in Kirtland on the 25th of April 1834, where I f was introduced to the prophet Joseph  the first time I had ever seen him. He invited me to make his house my home  which kind offer I excepted of & staid with him about one week. I have for  the first time became acquainted not ownly with the Prophet Joseph & his family but  with many of the High Priests, Elders & Saints which I had never before seen  I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland & heard many of the ^leading^ Elders speak & I felt to rejoice   before God for the light & knowledge which was manifest to me during that day  through the preaching of the Elders of Israel. According to appointment I left Kirtland  upon the 1st day of May with a part of the company went to New Portage  where we remained untill all the company came up joined us, from Kirtland & we  were organized.  Then on the 7th day of May we took up our march like the Children  of Israel pitching our tents by the way, & travelled to Missouri according to  the account already spoken of in the Church History, which was called ^the Camp of^ Zions  Camp which went up to redeem Zion & assist those persecuted brethren.  Our whole journey, manner of travelling, incidents upon the way, the way the Lord fought   our battles with hail & storm, at Crooked River, the visitation of the cholera to  our camp, the death & burial of the Saints &c has all been published in the Church  History. we arrived After we had pitched our tents in Clay County Missouri  ^our numbers being 205^ & many of the Brethren had been taken sick & some had died Joseph requested the   camp to dispersed except enough to take care of the sick all who had teams were   required to leave the ground & go among the brethren I went to Brother Lyman   Wights in company with Heman Hyde & Milton Holmes. After a few days  Joseph called the ^Brethren^ people to gather at Lyman Wights and told the people ^them^ if they would   humble themselves before the Lord & covenant to keep His commandments & obey   his council the plague should be stayed from that hour, & their should not be another 
 case of cholera in the camp. The people ^brethren^ covenanted to do this & the plague   was stayed & there was not another case in camp. Joseph held several meetings  with the ^Saints^ Saint Set them in order, & ^President Joseph Smith^ returned home with many other of the brethren  I remained with Lyman Wight laboring with my hands till the following winter. * ^(*see paper apart & page 9th)^  At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights in Clay County Missouri  I was ordained to the office of a Priest * ^* By the direction of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter on the 5 day of Nov 1834^ in I had a great desire in my  heart to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to my fellow men for I saw such  blessings, beauty & glory in it that I had a great desire to assist my brethren  in proclaiming it to the inhabitants of the Earth t and this desire continued  to increase upon me, but I did not reveal my feelings to any man, but soon  ^(the above lines are in paper apart {[shorthand?]} 32)^  after I was ordained to the office of a priest I received an ^appointment^ mission by Bishop  Edward Partridge to go in connexion with Elder Harry Brown on a mission  through the Southern part of Missouri & through the Arkansas, into the Southern  States Agreeable to ^my^ this appointment I bid my brethren farewell in Clay  County & on the 13th day of January 1835 I took my valise in hand weighing  15 lbs mostly Books of Mormon & started in company with Elder Harry ^Brown^ without  without purse or scrip & crossed the ferry ^river^ into Jackson County, * ^* as we stepped onto the bank two horsmen le^a^d there horses onto the bank they eyed us very closely but said^ ^nothing to us^ we stopped south  open our mission This was the first & last time that we ever trod the soil of  Jackson County, we felt thankful for the privilege & we bowed our knees before  the Lord & offered up the gratitude of our hearts unto our Father in heaven for  the privilege & prayed for his protection whi from the mob while going through  the county as the Saints had just been driven out and ^as^ a Latter Day Saint perriled  his life to found in the county, we prayed that the judgments of God might  rest upon the wicked who had shed the blood of the Saints in that land that their  blood might be avenged & that the land might be cleansed from sin wicked-  ness & abominations & redeemed that the Saints might again inherit it  we arose & went on our way rejoiceing. I had in my possession  a petition to the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us in   Jackson County for the purpose of obtaining signat[ure] unto it we bent our   way south through Jackson County without any harm yet in one instance we   were miraculously preserved from a large mob ^of about 60^ assembled at a grog shop which we   had to pass. On the 18th Jan we called at the Harmony Mission had an interview   with the president of the mission a Presbyterian minister, it was near sun down  he would neither give us any thing to eat nor keep us because we were mormons  it was 15 miles to the nearest house which was an ^Jerrews^ Indian traiding house kept 
 kept by a Mr Jerrew, we asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directi  ^directions^ the Spirit said to me that he was decieving us, directeing us wrong, I asked the question  3 times over & he declaired he was telling us the truth we followed his direction  & it led us into the Osage River swamp where we were lost in the darkness of   the night ^we undertook to follow the river but it being about the crookedest one in earth America we made but slow progress^ ^and^ after travelling through mud & water for one hour we concluded to go   out onto the open prairie & lide lie down in the grass untill morning but when we got   out into the prairie we h[e]ard the Osage Indians drum & shout at the trading house  as they were having a powwow we followed by the sound, & went into  their midst * ^*as we approached we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs they smelt of us in a friendly manner^ ^but did not try to bite nor bark we arrived about midnight, covered with mud hungry and weary^ we were kindly received by Mr Jerrew fed & lodged for the night  19th Mr Jerrew gave us a good breakfast set us across the Osage River  ^(see paper apart 2nd page 10)^  in a canoe & was started upon our long days walk it being 60 miles to the   nearest house in the direction we were going ^and we had not a morsel of anything with us to eat^ Most of our travels through the day was  through prairie before dark we entered timber timber land as we were approaching  the timber a large black bear came out of the timber & met us we had   no weapons but a small pistol but as the bear got within about 6 rods of us he  rose upon his hind feet & examined us a short time & turned & went off  another course we travelled on as fast as we could we were soon invelloped in   so thick darkness it was with great difficulty that we could keep the road we were  soon surrounded with a large drove of wolves who ^that^ kept up a continual howling  & would freequently rush upon us & come up within a few feet of us we travelled  about one two hours in this situation feeling that we were in danger we concluded   to stop & build a fire & wait till morning. Accordingly we built a large   fire which drove the wolves of & as we were about to lie down we h[e]ard   a dog bark & also a bell, we found we were near a house we took   each of us a brand of fire & in going about one quarter of a mile we   found a ^log hut about 12 feet square^ house occupied by one Mr. Williams who was in Jackson County during the   mobing of the Saints, & he had lately moved to this place depending upon his gun mostly for   his living it being 60 miles to a house on the north of him, & 12 miles on the south  He and his family was living in a small old log house ^hut^ about 12 feet square & one   bed in the room upon which lay his wife several children & 3 young dogs. He lay   stretched out upon the ^bare^ floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to   the house but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way, it was past 11 oclock at   night I turned away the quilt looked into the house every thing was in sound sleep  I spoke 3 times no one stired not even a dog, I walked in & laid my hand upon   the mans shoulder the mo & spoke to him the moment he felt the wait of   my hand he leaped to his feet & commenced running around the room leaping as high 
 as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened as we were travellers   & friends & did not wish to hurt him but wished to stop with him him  over night, when he came to his senses we as he gave us permission to   stop with him till morning if we would take the bare floor as he did then  we excepted, we asked for something to eat as we had walked 60 miles with[out] eating a   morsel of food. He said he had nothing for us said that hed had got to kill   game for his breakfast in the morning. He said the cause of his fright was he  he had shot a large panther dead a few nights before standing in his door, & he thought   his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the bear floor & we were    glad of this place as it soon began to rain & rained hard through the night  we arose in the morning & went on in the rain 12 miles to a Mr Conners  who was also in the Jackson County mob who gave us a breakfast but damned   us while we were eating because we were mormons & when we had finished a   hearty breakfast we thanked him very politely for it and went our way and left him swareing   ^We did feel thankful for it for we had walked 72 miles without any thing food but very little^  ^see page apart 2 page 11^  We continued travelling preaching by the way without stoping ownly over night, ^or on the^ ^Sabbath^ untill  we got to Petty John Creek in the Arkansas Territory. Here Mr Allexander   Akeman resided with a large family of sons & one daughter all of which we   settelled around him Mr Akeman was a member of the Church in Jackson   County & a part of his family, his wife died strong in the faith in Missouri,  his whole family was mobed some of his sons were whiped severly. But he could   not stand the persecution & the loss of his property. He moved to Arkansas  to get rid of mormonism had apostitised & was bitter against the work, when   we called upon him he opposed us strongly, spoke against the leaders of the Church   & the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us & had a little   faith I had a dream the night before I went there what we should meet with  & what would transpire. ^relate the dream^ When we met with opposition not ownly by Mr Akeman  but from many in the neighborhood Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately  & continue his journey I told him I should stay & see my dream fulfilled  we staid in the neighborhood 25 days during which time the Lord brought judgment  upon those who had threatened to mob us & take our lives many of them died suddenly  while we were there and I was warned three times of the Lord to go with Mr  Akeman & bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism & the wickedness  of his course in opposing it & the last time I called upon ^him^ he was filled with wrath   against me & when I left his house he followed me in a rage apparently with some   evil intent when a few rod I had got a few rods from his door he was nearly   treading upon my heels he fell dead at my feet as though he had been   struck with a thunder bolt ^lightning^. He immediately began to swell & turned black 
 this created a great wailing & mourning with his famil, Brother Brown   & myself assisted the family in laying him out & burying him. He died   on the 14th day of Feb 1835 & we buried him on the 16. This clo singular  dispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people & they began to reflect &  wished to hear preaching, we held several meetings & preached to the people we  baptized a Mr Hubbel & his wife aged people who had opened their doors   & given us a home & just as we had got the people prepared to receive   the Gospel & anxious to learn & pleading with us to stay & preach, Brother   Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south. I was fully satisfied   that should we stop we should build up a Church, & I was convinced it was   our duty to stop but Brother Brown held the office of an Elder I a priest  & we were travelling together upon a mission, & I felt that I must subject  to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.  This is an error which   many have committed in this Church who were sent as missionaries to the  world, as soon as they get doors open & a people prepared to receive the gospel  they go away & leave them we left this people with tears in their eyes we left  & Brother Brown did not baptize another person during his whole southern  mission we left them on the 2nd day of March went upon the bank of   the Arkansas River cut down a large cotton wood tree dug out a canoe   4 feet wide 12 feet long put on a pair of oars & rowed down the Arkansas   River 125 miles to Little Rock geting ^beging^ our food by the way a meal at a time  as we had an opportunity, after visiting Little Rock we tied up our canoe ^travelled down the river 10 miles^ on   below Little Rock & tied up our canoe on the East Bank & stoped with a Mr Jones  preached next day at his house on the 16 left our canoe with Mr Jones walked back   ^the East Bank of the Arkansas River & started on foot to ward & wade the Mississippi^  ^Swamp to Memphis Tennessee we travelled on the old military road it was over 200  miles the way we travelled ^up the river 10 miles took the old^ ^the road^ & almost the whole distance was knee deep in mud &  water up the river 10 miles opposite Little Rock & took the old military   road & started to waid the missippi swamp which was mostly covered with   water from Little Rock Arkansas to Memphis Tennessee, a distance of   about 175 miles, we waided through mud & water knee deep day after day & in some instances  40 miles per day before we could get a stoping place. On the 24th while in the   swamp I had an attack of the rheumatism & could not travel but slow  My companion Brother Brown had got in a hurry & wished to hasten to   the Missippi River take boat close up his mission, take boat & return  to his family in Kirtland, & as I could not travel as fast as he   wished so we parted to meet no more for about 3 years he left me siting on   a log in the mud & water I being lame & unable to walk & no food & 12 miles to the 
 nearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste I then knelt   down in the water & prayed the Lord to heal me up & the spirit of the Lord rested   upon me & I was healed the pain left me I arose & went my way ^*^ whenever   I met with one or more families I preached to them & bore   my testimony as I went alone to the people I arrived at the Missippi River  & crossed it in the evening of the 27th March 1835 [FIGURE]  (*^after^ that night that ^after^ Brother Brown left me in trying to travel in the night to me he lost  his ^way^ got into a thicket of brambles & tore nearly all of his cloths off from him  He stoped at a cabin & took him nearly all night to mend up his clothes)  [FIGURE] I stoped for the night at a publick house kept by Mr Josiah Jackson I was [illegible]  up for ^of being^ an imposture Mr Jackson believed I was one of Murrells clan ^instead of a Mormon preacher^ who was  then murdering & stealing Negroes through the country & to test the thing he gathered   to gether a large house full of the the wickedest & most corrupt J Gentry in the city  & set me to preaching, to them, to test whether I could preach or not. I do not  think that Mr Jackson or the same company of men & women will ever meet   to gether again for the same purpose to test whether a Mormon Elder could preach or  not for they would not like again to have their sins & abominations revealed to   each other as plainly & pointedly as I told them that night through the inspiration   of the Holy Ghost, they seemed glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms,  I travelled from Memphis to Middle Tennessee. And on the 4th of April  I met with Elder Warren Parish at Father Frys in Benton County ^Middle^ Tennessee  He & David Patten had been labouring to gether through the winter in Tennessee they had   baptized some 20 or 30 persons Elder Patten had returned to Kirtland at that time  before I arrived. I joined Elder Parrish & we laboured to gether ^over 3 months^ and continued  *^and travelled & preached daily baptizing such as would receive our testimony on the 23rd of June^  ^we received a letter from Oliver Cowdery saying that they wished ^Elder^ Parrish to come to Kirtland & for me to remain^  ^to take charge of the Southern Churches & the Lord would bless me in so doing^  to extend our labourse through Tennessee & Kentucky, Elder Warren Parrish ordained  me to the office of an Elder. On the 28th day of June at Father Frys Eagle  Creek Benton County Tennessee  we baptized some 40 persons while labouring to gether  & on the 23rd of July ^1835^ I parted with Elder Parish also returned to Kirtland  This left me alone in my labours in the South. I continued to travel alone  through the year & extended my labours both in Kentucky & Tennessee I baptized   43 persons during this season 31 after Brother Parrish left me    On the 15 day of Nov while traveling about 12 miles in the night with severall  of the Brethren among whom was Brother Benjamin Clapp, a tremendous storm of wind   & rain over took us it was exceeding dark we bacame lost in a forest & we  crossed a dangerous stream some 20 times we had a creek to cross, the rain  ^stream^ had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without 
 swimming our horses & several of the company were females & could not consistently  cross the stream he and we undertook to head the stream so that we could cross  sufficient to ford it, but in in the attemp in the midst of the darkness of the night  & the raging of the wind & rain we became lost in the thick woods we had neither fire,  light, or road, but was in the darkness, rain, wind, mud, creeks, & treetops we crossed   the stream near twenty times & setting aside our females & horses we made more the appearance  of fishermen than travelers. I thought of Paul's perils by water but the Lord was   merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were gropeing with in   the darkness like the blind for the wall suffering under the pelt cold ^bursts^ & pelting ^hail^ floods  of wind & rain ^of the storms^ & runing the risk of killing both ourselves & animals by riding off   steep bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone around about us & revealed unto  us our perilous situation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf, the light continued   with us untill we found a house & got put upon ^learned^ the right road then the light   disappeared the darkness returned yet we were enabled to reach the house of Brother   Henry Thomas at 9 oclock in the evening, without any harm having rode 20 miles  being 5 hours in the storm, having forded creeks or [krakes] twenty or more  times but neither male or female murmured but ^and^ felt to thank God for our preservation  often    I received a letter from Oliver Cowdery at the time that  Warren   Parrish was called home. Councilling me to During the winter, ^&^ spring, & for part of the ^summer of 1836^  I continued to labour ^mostly alone^ through Kentucky & Tennessee extended my labours opening  new places preaching daily, baptizing, confirming, & organizing new branches  holding conferences &c At a conference held at Brother Clapp on Taropen  Calaway County, Kentucky, ^on the 26 day of Feb 1836^ I ordained A O. Smoot & Benjamin Boydston  Elders & Daniel Thomas & Benjamin Clapp to the office of a priest  Brothers Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labour of the ministry  Elder Smoot freequently accompanied me upon my mission  On the 21st day of April 1836 Elder David Patten returned to Tennessee   to again join me in my labours he Sister Patten came with him  I met with him on the 21st day of April 1836 in Henry County Tennessee  Tennessee it was truly a happy meeting. He related to me the blessings   which he had received in Kirtland during ther endowment which was   great & glorious & caused my heart to rejoice We travelled &   laboured together & preached daily, & continued to baptize such as would  receive our testimony persecution began to rage against us in the South Elder   Patten bore a very plain & pointed testimony unto the people of the work of God 
 in the last days & when we were opposed by a mob he would rebuke them in great  plainness we were not injured or molested ownly threatened, the sick were freequently  healed under our administration. On the 27th of May 1836 we were  again joined by Elder Warren Parrish direct from Kirtland Ohio who also  laboured with us. We held a conference on the 28th day of May at Brother Seth Utley ^in Benton County Tennessee^  where there was 7 Branches represented   containing 116 members Abel Wilson & Jesse Turpin were ordained priest  & Albert Petty a teacher. On the 31st day of May I was ordained under  the hands of David W Patten & Warren Parrish, Elder Patten being mouth unto  the office of the High Priesthood & a member of the 2nd Quorum of Seventies  [FIGURE] Elder Patten prophesied many blessings upon my head. We continued to   extend our labour upon a circuit of several hundred miles.  Elder A. O. Smoot also laboured constantly with us and Benjamin  L Clapp freequently—we would travel at times two by two then we would  all meet to gether ^to hold conferences &c^ at certain points we laboured dilligently & faithfully  administering in the ordinances of the gospel as we had an opportunity.  Persecution began to rage against us in Benton County Tennessee and   on the 19th June a ^states^ warrant was issued against David Patten Warren W   Parrish & Wilford Woodruff sworn out by Mathew Williams at Methodist  priest served by the shiriff Robert C Petty Elders Patten & Parrish   were taken by an armed mob of about 50 under form of law led by   the sheriff a colonel 1st & 2nd Major with other Officers & a   Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder, I was in another   county & not taken we were accused of prophesying falsely by   saying that 4 persons who were baptized should received the Holy Ghost   in 24 hours & that Christ would come in this generation. The second   time before this generation passed away. The whole concern was a ^mob^ mock trial  contrary to law, justice judgment, mercy or truth. The particulars of which  were recorded in D. W. Pattens account. On the 25 ^June^ I preached in the   Court House in Dresden Weebly County Tennessee to a crowded house was  followed by Brother A O Smoot & Benjamin Clapp. On the 27 I  went to a Baptist meeting house on Thompsons Creek to fulfill a previous  appointment when I arrived the house was crowded with people I entered the   pulpit & was asked to speak when the Baptist priest Mr Browning arrived   on horseback at the door directly steped inside the door in great  agitation & told the Deacons to forbid my preaching in the house 
 at the same time began to talk about the mormons & told several  lies which I corrected before the people, this still enraged him worse  and I was forbidden to preach in the house I told the people  as I had been invited to preach to them & had come 10 miles  to fulfill the appointment I would like to preach to them, I was willing   to stand on a fence, wood pile, on a cart or anyplace they would   appoint a man rose & said he owned the land in front of the meeting  house I might stand upon that & preach & welcome all the congregation  except the Minister & one Deacon left the house walked across the street  formed seats out of a worm fence & gave good attention while I   preached for an hour & a half upon the first principles of the   Gospel when I closed I gave liberty for anyone to speak that wished  Mr Randolpph Allexander arose & made a few remarks it being the  first time he had a Mormon Elder speak, "He said the people at the present  day made him think of a pen of hogs the keeper would make a trought &  pour into it any thing & they would drink it, hot or cold water, dish water  or anything els, but let a stranger come along & pour over a bucket   of corn on the back side of the pen & the hogs would be frightened & run &  snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people their priest will  feed the people with ^them on^ any kind of food or doctrine no matter how fals the people   will drink it down but let a stranger come & preach the truth as Mr  gospel of Jesus Christ which will save the people as Mr Woodruff has   done & the people are afraid of him." Mr Allexander invited me home  bought a Book of Mormon of me, & was soon baptized and ^as was^ several   others were soon baptized in that place. July 14 th I wrote a letter   to president Oliver Cowdery at Kirtland Ohio & sent him a list of   subscribers for the Messenger & Advocate and gave him an account of  my Mission in the South. 18th I rode in company with Brother A  O Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee River their was no ferryman to  cross us over, we were offered the use of the ferry boat, so we let our  own horses unto it & concluded to row ourselves acrosst ^we ferried ourselves^ but not being   much used to the business and loosing one oar in the river having to row   with one broaken oar we landed a great distance below the usual place  of landing with a high circulation of blood & blistered hands but   our horses leaped the bank & we went on our journey to the Sandy  & swam our horses across the streamwent to Mr Thomas Fraziers & spent the   night. July 30th We rode to Mr David Criders and preached at 
 His house also on Sunday the 31st we were threatened with a mob we  I baptized Mr Crider amid the scoffs & jeers of the rablle  they did not mob us but went in the night & poisoned both  of our horses the one which I rode belonging to Brother Samuel   West died in [t◊◊◊◊] two days afterwards Brother Smoots recovered  the hogs that eat of the horse flesh also died. August 11th I rode to  Mr Gainers in Henry county Tennessee ^with Brother Smoot^ where we had the priviledge of again   met with Brother David W Patten & his wife, Brother Patten  and Parrish had been driven from place to place by a mob because   of their religions they were driven out of Benton County into Henry County  Elder Parrish had left for Kirtland. I headed ^laboured^ with Brother Patten  & Smoot and preached daily through the County untill the 29th when  we were visited by Elders Thomas B Marsh & Elisha H Groves  who had come direct from Caldwell County Missouri, we had a  pleasing interview. On the 2nd of Sept we held a conference  at Damonds Creek Calaway County KY. There were present T. B. Marsh  D W Patten ^of the Twelve Apostles and Elders^ E. H. Groves, W. Woodruff A. O. Smoot D. Cathcart  & other official Members. President Marsh presided.

At the conference I was dismissed from my labours in   the South by Elders Marsh & Patten and councilled to go to   Kirtlind & get my Endowment, as was also Elder ^A O^ Smoot,  we however again visited the south th[r]ough most of the our field  of Labor before leaving and baptized several persons among the number  was Parson Baity a preacher of the Denomination called Christians  On the 19th Sept at the house of Brother Camps in Kentucky I took the parting  hand with Brother ^T. B^ Marsh D. W. Patten & wife & E. H. Groves who started in   a two hors waggon for Far West Mo. The same day they left I orgin-  ized the first company of Saints who ^that^ ever emigrated from the  Southern States for Zion which consisted of Lewis & Benjamin Clapp  & families Albert Petty & John Camp and their families and Elders  Boydston & Cathcart numbering 22 souls I travelled with them the first  day ^8 miles^ to the South fork of Mayfield where we pit[c]hed our tents for the night 
 I gathered this small camp together in Brother Albert Petty tent and   we appointed Elder ^Benjamin^ Boydston as their leaded to Colwell County Mo. I then  addressed ^taught them^ upon the subject of their journey the importance of their being united,  following the council of their leader, remembering their prayers night &   morning, before the Lord. I was followed by Elders Boydston Clapp &   Cathcart and the rain poured down in torents during the whole time  untill we were thoroughly wet in a good tent    On the morning of the 20 Sept 1836 I parted with this ^the^ camp who  started upon their journey for Zion. I then spent a few days with  Elder A. O. Smoot in visiting several of the branches we travelled 224 miles  and baptized & & confirmed 8 persons and obtained 30 subscribers for  the Messenger & Advocate. And on the 25 Oct in company with ^with^  A. O Smoot and Jesse Turpin For the first time in my life I   went on board of a Steeam boat called the Aid and started upon   our journey for Kirtland this was the first time I had ever travelled   upon a Steem boat.  We left the Steemer at Louisville on the   28th And we spent 19 days in visiting the relatives of Elder Smoot  and preaching among the people we visited the Big Bone lick in  Kentucky from where the mamouth bones are taken which have  been deposited in the various Museums in America & Europe  we arrived in Cincinnati on the 17 Nov where we saw the ^thirteen person^ dead  & wounded taken from the Steemer Florg Flora which had burst her  pipes while running a race. there was 13 caused [as◊◊◊e] dead & wounded  we arrived in Kirtland on the 25 Nov 1836 where I again had the  happy privilege of striking hands ^meeting^ with the Prophet Joseph & many of the Elders  with whom I was acquainted in the Camp of Zion. I went through each   apartment of the temple, and felt to rejoice in the privilege of treading the   course of the Temple of ^the Lord^ God which was built by Commandment & Revelation  in my day. Nov 29th It being Sunday I attended meeting in the Temple for the  first time. In the forenoon I heard President Joseph Smith preach to the people  much to my edifycation and comfort. In the afternoon I was called into the  stand to speak to the people I read the ##Isaiah 56|56 chapter## of Isaiah and made some remarks  upon it and gave an account of my mission in the South and was followed  by Elder ^A O^ Smoot ^also addressed the Saints^ The Sacrament was administered and I felt to rejoice in  the communion with the Saints. I was councilled with by the Presidency  to attend a Latten ^the^ School in ^the Temple taught by professor Haws I studied the Latin^ Kirtland during the winter according to council I entered  ^Language and English Grammar^ the School taught by Professor Haws and commenced boarding with Brother ^Ira^ Bond

He was the first to circulate it I herd President Joseph Smith declare  in the presence of F. G. Williams D Whitmer E Smith W Parrish & others that he  had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject of the Kirtland Safety  Society. He was alone in a room by himself he not ownly had the voice of the spirit  but an audible voice upon the subject and said if we wo the people would give heed  to his council all would be well.

Joseph blessed the people in the  name of the Lord and said if we would be faithful we should arise above our embaris-  ments and be delivered from the hands of our enemies.    (30. I wrote an peace ^article^ which was published in the Messenger & Advocate)    Jan 31: An address was delivered in the Temple upon the temporal interest of the  Church of Christ by President Joseph Smith, and Sidney Rigdon. A petioton  was prepared to present to the Legislature of Ohio asking for a charter to support  the Kirtland Safety Society.    Feb 19th Sunday I attended the meeting at the Temple ^president^ Joseph ^Smith^ had been absent on  business for the Church but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from   Israel yet many of the people in Kirtland if they did not make a calf to worship  as did the Israelites, they turned their hearts away from the Lord and from Joseph [##Exodus 32:1-8##]  they had engaged in speculation and given away to fals spririts untill they were dark-  ened in their minds and many were opposed to Joseph ^Smith^ and some wished to appoint  David Whitmore as prophet ^a^ to lead the Church in ^his^ stead of Joseph it was in the midst  of this cloud of dark spirits that Joseph returned to Kirtland and this morning arose  in the stand. when he first arose in the he appeared as though he was much  depressed in spirit but soon the spirit of God rested upon him and he addressed the   Assembly in great plainness for about three hours and he put his enemies to silence  for the time being when he arose he said I am still the ^President^ prophet, seer, and revelator  and leader of the Church of Jesus Christ and kingdom of God upon the Earth.  God and not man has appointed and placed me in this position and No man  or set of men has ^have^ power to remove me or appoint another in my stead and those 
 that undertake it if they do not spedily repent they will go to hell and burn  their fingers. He reproved the people sharply for their sins darkness and unbelief  the power of God rested upon him and bore testimony that what he said ^his sayings^ was true.  His discourse was not reported and here cannot be given. He also addressed the  people again on Sunday the 26th March 24th I left my school to make some  preparations for my Endowment March 23rd This day was spent in the Temple by the  saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer the House was divided into four parts  by vails the females the females occupied 2 apartments and the males the other two.  The Patirarch Joseph Smith sen ^Presided He^ called upon me to read a Chapter in the Book of  Mormon. I read the third Chapter of the Book of ##Jacob 5|Jacob## containing the parable of  the bare Olive tree likend unto the House of Israel, I made a few remarks upon  the subject, the time was occupied during the day in singing, exhortation, prayer and  the exercising of the gifts, some spoke in tongues, others interpeted. The Spirit of the Lord  was poured out upon the people in a great degree, at the close of the meeting there was a  ^a^ contribution ^was^ taken up for the poor. 26 Sunday in the forenoon the sacrament was  administered to the Saints, in the afternoon Elder W Parrish preached the funarel  Sermon of the wife of Elder Parley P. Pratt who died March 25 1837.  April 4th I received my washings and anointings in the House of the Lord in Kirtland  I spent the whole night in the Temple with others of the seventies in prayer and fasting  the spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After praying and fasting for 24 hours I went  home and partook of food. On the 6th day of April 1837 The presidency  of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, High priests, Seventies, with the ^and^ other Quorums of  the Church- met in solmum assembly to transact the business of the Church  after spending an hour in the lower part of the House, the presidency called the  Seventies into an upper room. And there removed six of the presidency of the  seventies into the High Priest Quorum, then appointed six others to take their  place as Presidents of the Seventies. Then the presidency of the Church ^and^ sealed  upon our heads, our washings, anointings, & blessings with a loud shout of Hosanna  to God & the Lamb. The spirit and power of God rested upon ^us^ to the joy of our hearts  after spending three hours in the upper rooms we then joined the congregation of the  Saints in ^The Quorums then repaired to^ the Lower Court and each the vails were closed ^lowered^ and each appartment  attended to the duties of their office. The ^the Ordinance of washing of feet was administered^ washing of the feet of the anointed was  the next business attended to, The Twelve assisted the presidency of the Seventies to wash  the feet of the Elders Elder ^H. C.^ Kimball washed my feet and pronounced blessings upon me  my head. when at the close of ^after^ this ordinance the veils ^of the Temple^ were rolled up which  brought the whole assembly congregation into one assembly. The Presidency occupied  the lower stand of the priesthood. And ^and^ President Joseph Smith arose and addressed  the Saints ^Elders^ for the term of three hours clothed with the spirit and power of God 
 He unbosomed his feelings in the House of his friends gave much important instruction   to the Elders which was not reported he urged upon us ^the absolute necessity of giving strict heed to obey^ to give heed to his teachings and  councils ^and the revelations of the Lord to the Church^ and be wise in all things that Zion and her stakes might be redeemed and  esstablished ^no more to be thrown down^ in esstablished. He said that the Kings of the Earth would yet come to  behold the glory of Zion and great and glorios blessings would be bestowed upon the  Saints in the last days. Hiram Smith followed Joseph and bore testimony to the truth  of what he had said. He ^&^ was followed by Oliver Cowdery who made but few   remarks He exhorted the Saints ^Elders^ to keep within the bounds of their knowledge  and let the great mysteries of the kingdom alone, for the gentiles had not a knowledge  even of the first principles of the gospel, for it is far better to preach what the people  would call the small things of the Kingdom than to enter into the visions of  Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John. He was followed by Elder Sidney Rigdon with  a few remarks. Then the Twelve were called upon to break bread ^which was distributed to the^ to the multi-  tude, (as Jesus did in the days of the Apostles ^who eat and were filled^) And the multitude eat and were filled  and rejoiced together at the closed of the feast thanks was returned to the  Lord for his blessings with uplifted hands to heaven which was at the ^Thanks was returned at the meeting closed at the^   setting of the sun. But The House was again filled at candle light  and the meeting again commenced with much interest. The prophet Joseph  ^President Smith^ requested the congregation ^Elders^ to speak their feelings freely and sing exhort or  pray as the spirit should give utterance. The meeting continued during the  whole night many of the gifts were poured out upon the people. and at break  of day the meeting was ^we were^ dismissed and we returned to our homes  I also spent the night of the 7th in the Temple with several of the  Elders in prayer and praise before the Lord the Holy Ghost rested upon  us and the spirit of prophesy was given unto ^us^ and many things were  shown us by the Holy Spirit.

Rigdon, spoke followed by the  Prophet Joseph ^April 9th president Smith spoke in the afternoon^ He & said in the name of the Lord that the judgments of God would  rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends and friends to humanity  and the ^in^ building up Kirtland the ^a^ stake of Zion, but had turned traitors to him and  to interest of the Kingdom of God had given power into hands of our enemies  against us, and they had oppressed the poor Saints, and had become covenant   breakers for which they will feel the wrath of God, he said they had become  whited walls and sought to bring distress upon the Saints    April 13th 1837 I married Phebe W Carter daughter of Ezra & Sarah  Carter of Scarborough Maine I was married at the house of President Joseph Smith

It being Sunday morning and  feeling anxious to commenced our work I inquired if their was any religion  on the Island and what kind, any preachers or Meeting Houses and what kind  I was informed their was a Baptist Meeting house, Baptist Minister, Church  and meeting the ministers name was Gideon J. Newton as it was late we did not  go till the after noon meeting. Mr Benjamin Kent piloted us to the place ^Baptist Meeting House^  when we arrived  ^occupied by Elder Gideon J Newton pastor of the ownly religious denomination upon the Island. At the^  at the door the meeting had begun, I sent for the Deacon who came to the doors  I told him I wished him to inform the minister that there was two servants ^we were servants^   of God at the door who ^and^ wished to deliver a message to that people. He sent word  for us to come into the pulpit accordingly with valiece in hand we walked  up into the pulpit and took a seat one on each side of him, when  he closed his discourse he asked me what hour we would like to speak  to the people I told him at 5 oclock he gave out our appointment and  invited us to his house to take tea we accepted the invitation on arriving at   his house I asked how many school houses there was on the Island he  said four ^4^ ^four^ and gave me their names ranging from West to East I asked him 
 if they were free for any one of to preach in. He said yes I took  out my Bible, Book of Mormon, & Doctrin & Covenants and laid them  all upon his stand he took them up and examined them but asked no  question ^but said said he said would read them^ the hour of meeting arrived, the house was full I preached to  the people upon the first principle of the gospels and bore testimony that the  Lord had raised up a prophet and had commenced to establish his  Church and Kingdom again upon the Earth in fulfillment of the word of   God or spoken through the Ancient Prophets and Apostles this was the first  discourse ever delivered by any latter Day Saint upon this chain of Islands Elder   Hale bore testimony to the truth of what I had said I gave liberty to all present  to make any remarks no one spoke, at the close of the meeting I gave out an  appointments for preaching in the four school houses for the next four following evenings  the people came out in mass to investigate the principles which we taught the first  ^in^ 14 days of our stay upon the Island we preached 19 discourses. I thus opened  a door for baptisms when Capt Justice Ames and his wife came forward  and were baptized by Elder Hale being the first baptized upon those Islands  Elder Newton the Baptist Minister with his family attended about a dozen of the ^twelve^  first of our meetings, read the Books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord  that our Doctrin was true and he had a hard struggle for days in his mind  to know which to do either to receive or reject it. He finally resolved to  reject it and took a stand against us. He commenced preaching against us  also sent for Mr Douglass the Methodist Minister on the South Island to come over  and help him he had been long at variance with Mr Douglas but they now made  friends and united in a war against us but they did not stop the work of God  we continued preaching daily untill we baptized most of the members of Mr  Newtons, Church, and those who owned the meeting house. I then followed  Mr Douglass home to his own Island and commenced preaching to his  Church and baptized a good share of his members ^A number of those that we baptized were^ they also sent for other  ^sea Captains,^ Ministers from the Main Land who came over and tryed to put a stop to the work  by preaching and lying about us but the work continued to roll on they wished  me to work a miracle to convince them that my Doctrine was true, I told them  they had rejected the truth and they would see signs but not unto Salvation

The principle timber is fir, spruce, hemlock  and birch. Rasp and goose burys grow in great abundance. Sheep are the principle  stock. South Fox Island comes as near being without any form or void  as any thing I ever saw, and it would be difficult for a historian to give a  description of it. It is about 10 miles long and 5 wide and is one universal mass of  rocks, much of it granit, formed into shelves, hills, hollows, cut up into nooks and points  and canions to make room for the coves an harbors, which run through and through the  Island pop 1000, they get their living entirely ^live^ by fishing their principle stock is sheep  I do not recollect of ever seeing a horse on eith[er] Island their is some small patches  under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour and toil many from this Island  fish at New Foundland bring their fish home and dry them upon their own flakes, they supply  the market annually with a great amount of codfish, mackarell, and boxed herren, this   Island contains two stores, three tide saw mills, 6 school houses a small branch of the  methodist Church and a priest the timber is pine fir spruce hemlock and birch, also goose  bury, raspberies & whoretleburies and upland cramburies, grow upon the Island the bushes  and timber grows in a great measure out of the crack and cravices of the rocks  Their is a great amount of variety of fish inhabit the waters, coves, and harbors  around these Islands such as whale black fish, shark, ground shark, Pilot  fish, horse mackerel sturgeon, salmon, holloboat cod, Pollock, tom cod, hake,   haddock, mackarel, shad, bass, alewives, herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, whiting  Frostfish, Flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shid, cusk, bluebacks, scollop  Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lumpfish, squid, Fivefingers, Monkfish, Nursfish, Sunfish,  Swordfish, Thrasher, Cat, Scuppog, Tootog, eyefish Conner, Ling, Eels, also  Lobsters, Clams, Mussels, Rincles, Porposes, seals and others not named &c, &c *    On the 23rd Aug while standing upon the farm of Eleazar Carver on the North  Island I counted fifty five Islands many of which was inhabited    *On the 6th Sept   the harbor was filled with a school of Mackerell which the people caught ^in great numbers^ with hooks while  standing upon the wharf we also caught all that we wished in the same way 
 On the 7th Oct 1837 Elder Hale left and returned to his family in Kirtland  I continued labouring on the Islands and main land as far as Bangor  also visited other Islands including the Isle of Hold.    On the 2nd of Oct in company with Elder Hale I left the Islands and   returned to Scarborough ^on foot^ Elder Hale returned to Kirtland.    Oct 2nd I left the Island with Elder Hale Capt Ames took us to Thomastown  in a sloop 3rd we walked 46 miles to Bath. 4th we attended a Baptist  Convention in Bath and preached to a large congregation in the evening in   Pierces Hall the people gave good attention. 5th we walked 36 miles to portland  6 we walked 10 miles to Father Carters in Scarborough where I found  my wife and friends well. On the 9th I parted with Elder Hale who returned  to Kirtland I continued preaching through various towns on the Main Land  untill the 2nd of Nov when I again returned to Fox Islands ^accompanied by my^ and continued  ^wife who wished to visit the Island sisters upon the Islands of the sea    my labours preaching and baptizing. On the 14th I visited the Isl of Holt 12 miles  East of Fox Island preached to an attentive congregation left them the Book  of Mormon which they promised to read and returned on the 16, in the same  vessel that I went over in as I had ^an^ appointments in vinal Haven on the 17th,  which was necessary for me to attend. I laboured mostly upon those Islands during  ^I labored here during^ the winter of 1837 & 8, and as nearly evry person oupon those Islands had over 10 years  old had attended my meetings and investigated the principles of mormonism the people  began to ^and^ take sides either for or against, ^us^ and our enemies would gather together at  times to try ^made attempts^ to break up our meetings, while holding a meeting on the North  Island. On the evening of the 15 Jan 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the  United States Revenue Cutter whose business it was while coasting to protect the  Lives and Liberties of all American citizens as far as they could they hauled  on shore a panel of cannon ^Brought on shore^ a swivel and joined the mob and paraded near  the house where I was speaking ^preaching^ and discharged it several times followed by smaller  arms with the intention of breaking up our meeting, but it ownly caused me to   preach the longer and louder as some of the mob gathered around to see what effect  it would have I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgments  of God that awaited the wicked and I shook my garments in the presence of the people  and told them I was clear of their blood and ^but^ they heard my voice and words  ownly when mingle with the roar of Cannon and musketry, before I had done  speaking they went back on board of the Revenue Cutter taking their arms with ^them^  having accomplished nothing ownly showing the wickedness of their hearts, and burning  up some powder and grass. at the close of the meeting I baptized 2, also one next  day and while baptizing the mob again commencing^d^ fireing guns but being loaded with 
 nothing but powder they were harmless. The Baptist and Methodist joined  the mob, ^originated got up^ and tried to stir up the people and lied about us more than proved for their  benefit.  Mr Douglass the methodist priest on the South Island ^when argument found him^ applyed to the   ^to all the^ magistrates for a warrants against me for a lie bill for overthrowing his doctrin but ^they refused to grant them as he had no^   their was not a magistrate on the Islands would issue one to him.  ^cause of complaint but religious persecution^    On the 13th Feb 1838 I left the Islands I crossed in the mail boat to Hampden on  the main Land. I there met with ^ordained^ James Townsend I set him apart to the ministry  and we walked together through deep snows to the City of Bangor, preaching each  night and visited and preached in the Town of searsmont, Belfast, Northport  Frankfort Hampden, and twice in the City Hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, and  returned to the ^Fox^ Islands via Casteme and the Isle of Holt, arived in Vinal Haven the  8th March ^Elder Townsend returned home^. On the 22nd March I accompanied Brother Starreat at low tide onto a  barr to some 40 rods from shore to dig som clams, we were soon accompanied by Mrs  Woodruff and a Sister Stone who had a curiosity to see how clams were dug, the ground  for some 12 rods near shore was several feet lower than the point we were on we were  so busily ingaged in diging clams we did not observe the flowing tide untill we  were surrounded with water, and having no boat we had no other alternative  ownly to waid ashore and carry the women to dry land in an arm chair, which we  safely accomplished amid the reflection that the tide nor more than time waited for no  man,. On the 4th April I called at the post office and Mr Kent the post master  showed me a letter containing two sheets of fools cap signed by Warren Parrish  and several of the Twelve who had apostitized and been cut off from the Church the  letter was teeming with falshood against Joseph Smith and the Prophet and all that stood  by him it was sent with the intention to of breaking up the work upon these   Islands but it did not injure have the do accomplish it or hinder the work.    On the 11th April I was visited by Elder Townsend and Milton Holmes who  attended the conference with me upon both Islands and bore their testimony to the  people, but the spirit of opposition increased to a great hights, untill I felt warned  by the spirit to leave the Island for a season and take a western mission. after visiting  the saints from house to house, and praying with them and incouraging them I left  them on the 28th April and went to the main land with Elder Holmes & Townsend Mrs   Woodruff ^Mrs Woodruff^ had returned to her friends in Scar Fathers house on the 17th April We walked  to Scarborough, I left Scarborough May 7th walked to Bradford where I left  Elder Holmes, I walked to Boston and on the 11th I had an appointment to   preached at Sister Vose room. But I went to Cambridgeport to visit Elder A. P. Rockwood  who had been shut up in jail on pretense of debt but in reality out of persecution the  jailer shut ^locked^ me in and did not let me out till 10 oclock at night but while it 
 disappointed a congregation of people it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood  in conversing upon the work of God if we were ^although^ in Jail, it was the first time I had ever  met with him. On my return to Boston the people were still waiting to hear  me speak though at a late hour, I spoke to them a short time. On the 14 I left   Boston and walked some 30 miles to Hollistown to Deacon Havens and preached, I walked to   Providence RI, took steamer to New York arived on the 18 Met with Br Orson  Pratt and attended meetings with him ^un^till the 27. When I went up the North River  and preached at ^to^ New Burgh and preached in several towns in New York and New  Jersey and walked around the country to Farmington Connecticut and arived at my  Fathers house on the 11th June 1838 I commenced preaching at my Fathers house  to such as would come together to hear. Ond On the first day of July I baptized  six persons in Farmington river including my Father, step Mother, and ^my ownly^ sister Unis  Eunice, also cousin Seth Woodruff and aunt Anna Cossett, and Dwight Webster  a Methodist class Leader who was boarding at my Fathers house. When Father J  the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen gave me my blessing he said I should bring  my Fathers household into the Kingdom of God, I felt that it had been fulfilled this  day. I confirmed those baptized and organized this small branch of the Church  consisting of 9 members 8 of which were relatives, I ordained Dwight Webster  to the office of a Priest and administered the sacrament unto them. On the 3rd of July  after committing myself father Aphek Woodruff and his household into the hands of God  I bid them farewell and again ^I^ started for the state of Maine. I walked most of the  way to Boston there took steemer for Portland and arived at Father Carters ^In Scarboro^ on the 6th  On the 14th July My wife was delivered of a daughter wh at her Fathers house which  we named Sarah Emma. On July 22 I wrote a letter to Thomas B Marsh  giving him an account of my labours upon Fox Islands and the Eastern Country  On the 30th I left Scarborough and returned to the Islands I preached several times  to large congregations in Thomaston & the methodist meeting house in East Thomaston  and in the Town Hall in Camden before crossing to the Islands where I arived on the   7th Aug.  On the 9 Aug I received a letter from Thomas B Marsh informing me  of my appointment to fill the place in the Quorum of the Twelve of one who had fallen  and I was requested to come to Far West as soon as possible to prepare for a mission  to England in the spring. I immediately visited all the Saints upon both Islands  and earnestly exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves to accompany  me to the body of the Church in Missouri. Several immediately sold their property  but many were poor and had not the means to. Brother Nathaniel Thomas said   he would furnish means to help off all the poor saints upon Fox Islands who wished  to go, and for this purposes went with me to the main land ^on the 13th Aug^ and I assisted him 
 in procuring about two thousand Dollars worth of horses, waggons, tents &c for the   company. He paid about $1,500 of the expens himself $1,000 of which was to furnish  conveyance for the poor after purchasing the outfit for the company and urging the importance  of their starting as soon as possible not later than the first of Sept. On the 19th Aug  I left thesaints ^upon the Islands^ returned to town of Camden where we had prepared our outfit and returned  to Scarborough to prepare my own family for the journey, expecting to see the company in  few days but here I remained in great suspens untill the 1st Oct when Elder Townsend  went to meet the company. They arived in Scarborough on the 3rd Oct with their  waggon covers all flying. The company stoped at the house of Sister Sarah B Foss  we went to work nailed down all the covers and painted them and made them water  proof. And in the after noon of the 4th Oct 1838 ^with^ my wife bid her Father Mother &  friends fare well ^and with her child two month and a half old in the first stage of the hooping cough^ and we [FIGURE] started upon our journey. The company consisted of  53 persons including Brother Townsend & family and myself and family we had 10 waggons  a pair of horses to each waggon, we had now ^before us at this late period^ commenced this gloo 4th day of Oct  ^Before us^ to start upon a gloomy land journey of two thousand miles from Maine to Missouri  we continued to travel from day to day to day through all the rain, mud, cold, frost, and  snow, untill I arived in Rochester, Sangamont Co Illinos, on the 19th day of Dec.  where I stoped and setled my family and company for the winter. My wife had  passed through a severe course of the brain fever and her s while upon the journey  and her sufferings had been very great her spirit had left her body twice to all  human appearance and ownly been called back through the prayer of faith and the power of  God. Our child had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly chilled through   my whole system ^in crossing the bleak prairies^ ^*Brother Thomas had buried one child and^ that it was two months after I stoped before I got sufficiently thawed  nearly all the company had been sick through their exposures some of them had stoped by the way  out and warmed up to feel natural. ** We continued travelling untill we were obliged to  side we had wallowed through much mud and snow had broaken several axeltrees, and  stop in consequence of the bad roads and cold weather, I spent the remainder of  ^we suffered much upon the journey yet &^  the winter laboring with my ^hands^ for the support of my family. On the 8th day of March  1839 I attended a conference at Springfield Ill. their was present 8 seventies  6 Elders 3 priest and 1 Deacon, several were presented on ordination, we ordained  2 Elders & one priest. Brother Brewster was presented for ordination and Brother  Dunham strongly urged that he be ordained as did several others. I strongly objected to it  for I felt that the spirit the man possessed was not of God, a strong influence was  got up in his favor in Springfield, I called a vote of the Elders upon the subject and  all voted for him to be ordained except 3 of us two besides myself he then  came foreward d and demanded baptism ^ordination^ at my hands ^in the name of Jesus Christ^ I told him he should  not be ordained by my consent, for that was not the way God imparted the Holy  priesthood to the children of man he was not ordained and I marvelled that so  many should have voted for his ordination after seeing the spirit he manifested 
 March 13 I was pressed in spirit to go to Quincy Illinois and visit the  the saints who had fled their from their persecuters in Missouri I immediately  ^March 13^  I took my wife ^Family^ & child into my waggon and started on the 12th March and arived  ^March 13 I took my family and started for Quincy where I arived^   in Quincy on the 16. I dined with Emma Smith at Judge Clevelands I then  went on the bank of the river near Quincy and saw ^a great^ many of the Saints  old and young man wom & children lying in the mud and water in a hard rain  storm with^out^ scarcely any tent or covering which ^suffering^ was the fruits ^caused by^ of the unhallowed  persecution of the State of Missouri the sight filled my eyes with tears  while my heart was made glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints in the  midst of ther ^affliction^ dreary position. Sunday 17. I had an interview with Elder  ^President^ Brigham Young and John Taylor we held a meeting with the saints $50 and a number  of teams was raised to bring out the remainder of the people from Missouri. I made a statement  of the procedings of the Springfield Conference when the Church voted that Jonathan Dunham  be reproved for calling a conference at Springfield and for cherishing the wrong spirit  which Brewster possessed.  President Brigham Young councilled that the Twelve as soon  as possible immediately move their families to ^to locate their families in^ Quincy ^for the time being^ so they could be together in council  I left Quincy on the 20th arived in Springfield on the 23rd Held a meeting with the Saints  reproved Elder Dunham for his course in maintaining Brewster in his wrong spirit. He  confessed asked forgiveness & was forgiven I collected a donation of ^I returned to Rochester for my effects while at Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the  Saints in Quincy ^which I sent to them^ A messenger took it to the Brethren in that place. I arived in Rochester  on the 24th. On April 3rd while riding upon the running gears of a waggon, setting upon the  foreward bolster, the bolt came out of the copling pole which left the hind wheels I was imme-  diately shot up between the bolster and tongue with the coupling pole turned over upon the horses backs  the horses became frightened and ran onto an open prairie with me draging my head and  shoulders upon the ground after draging me in this position for several minutes I managed  to dr guide them so as to run into the corner of a high staked worm fence where I  landed with myself ^&^ horses in a pile, and escaped through the mercy of God with ownly a few  bruises without any broken bones. I settled my business and ^I^ returned to Quincy on the  8 April where I left my family and went to Far west with the Twelve and  attended the conference on the Temple Block on the 26 April 1839 where I was ordained  as one of the Twelve Apostles on the corner stone of the Temple under the hands of the Twelve  ^Elder^ Brigham Young being mouth. Elder G. A. Smith was also ordained ^at the same time^ to the same office. We  returned to Quincy on the 2nd day of May. On the 3rd in company with five of the  Twelve I went to Mr Cleevelands and had a happy interviewed with ^President^ Joseph Smith the  Prophet who had just escaped out of the hands of his persecuters in Missouri it was the 
 first time I had seen him for more than two years it was a happy meeting I attended   the conferences and meetings with the saints in Quincy untill the 15th when I left with  Elder Brigham Young and journeyed to Nau M Commerce with him crossed the river and settled  my family in a room in the old barracks in Montrose Brother Brigham Young and family occupied ^I moved my family to Montrose and occupied a room in the barracks^  ^with President Young and family^ the same room with me a short time I spent my time attending the meetings, council, and   conferences in I wrote ^in my journal^ the teaching of Joseph sayings, and prophesyings of Joseph from  time to time as I had an opportunity. July 22 I was with the prophet ^President^ Joseph ^Smith^ and his   council and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the prophet, he healed many on both  sides of the river who were sick nigh unto death, among ^them^ was Elijah Fordham and   Joseph B. Nobles, as the Prophet had healed many even the wicked rabble followed  to see the sick healed and as Joseph was about to cross the river a man came to  him and asked him if he would not go about 3 miles and healed two of his small  children which were twins about 3 months old and were sick nigh unto death, he was a  man of the world never herd a sermon preached by a Latter Day Saint, Joseph said   he could not go, but he would send a man, after a moments hesitation he turned  to me and said you go with this man and heal his children, at the same time giving  me a read po sick [silk] handkerchief and said after you lay hands upon them wipe their faces  with it and they shall be healed, and as long as you will keep that handkerchief it shall  ever remain as a league between you and me, I went and done as I was commanded  and the children were healed. On the 25 I was attacked with the chills and fever for the  first time in my life. I had a chill every other day and was very sick. On the 8th of  I laid hands upon my wife and children blessed then committed them into the hands of God  and started upon my English mission ^leaving my family sick and with not more than 4 days provision^ Brother Brigham Young rowed me across the river in a   boat, I was sick and feeble, when I landed I laid down upon the bank of the river on a   side of soal leather, the prophet Joseph came along and looked at me and said you are starting  on your mission, I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a missionary I look  more fit for the hospital or desecting room, ^than a missionary^ he replyed what do you say that for, go ahead in   the name of the Lord and you shall be healed and blessed on your mission I thanked him  A brother came along with a waggon I got and took me to carried me along a few miles  on my road, I started without purse or scrip I passed by Parley ^P^ Pratt who was hewing  house logs for a house barefoot, bareheaded, without coat or jaket on, he came to me and said I have  no money but I have got an empty purse. I will give you that. I went a few rods and found  Elder H. C. Kimball in nearly the same position, that Parley was, building a log cabin also he crossed  to me and ^said^ I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse. He blessed me and I   went along my way accompanied by Elder John Taylor I had a shake of the ague every other  day and lay on the bottom of the waggon while I travelled over the ^a^ stubs and stones  we stoped with Samuel and Carlos Smith at McComb held a meeting with the Saints 
 in that place they contributed ^$9^ to our necessities and George Miller gave us a horse  as Father Coultrin was going east he took us into his waggon to help us along we spent 5  days in Springfield where Elder Taylor printed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet upon  the Missouri persecution also had a trial with Elder Babbit having prepared a charge against  him for improper conduct. We sold our horse in Springfield, and left on the 21st continued  our journey we spent the night of the 24 with Dr Modasett, at Terrehaute. On the 28th  while travelling Elder Taylor had a suddent attack fell to the ground as though he had been  knocked down we administered to him and he revived, on the following day he fell again  and fainted several times, it seemed as though the Destroyer would take his life, we  travelled with him 4 days after he was taken sick, ^his sickness proved to be^ it was then evident that he had a hard  attacked of the billious fever we stoped with him ^two^ at a Jerman Tavern in Germantown Wane  County Indianna with a k kind family with whom he was acquainted, we stoped with  him two days, untill Father Coulton would stop no longer, I offered ^proposed^ to remain with   Brother Taylor but as I was sick with the fever and ague and not able to take care of   myself Brother Taylor he ^Brother Taylor^ advised ^me^ to continue my journey, with Father, Coultrin^ ^saying it was easier to take care of one sick man than two^ saying  that one such man could get along better than two, according to his council I committed  him into the hands of God and the family promised to do all in their power to make him comfortable  I parted with him with a heavy heart, on the 2nd Sept and continued my journey with  Father Coultrin to Cleaveland Ohio, I there took steamer on the 10th for Buffalo but we  had a severe gale and did not reach Buffalo untill the 12thth I travelled to Albany on a   canal boat had the ague daily, was very sick, had no companion except sectarian   priest who was daily lying about ^the mormons^ mormonism I took stage ^at Albany^ for Farmington  Ct on the night of the 19th and rode all night and the following day and suffering  immensely ^severely^ with the fever and ague I arived at my Fathers house in Farmington Ct  on the 21st Sept Quite sick I found my Father and family well.

I dismissed the meeting and went  away but both the congregation and mob remained on the ground till midnight and as there  was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates were anxious to be baptized, I went  down into the water and baptized five in the mids of a shower of stones the water  was all of a foam for a road around me none that I baptized were hit at all  and I was ownly hit twice one on my hip and one on the head it raised a large  bump on my head which all left me while confirming those I Baptized I afterwards  ^subsequently^ baptized many of the mob.

As soon as I delivered the paper to the office I went home and went to bed  and ^I was confined to my bed for forty days unabled to get up^ ^and^ passed through the most severe fit of sickness I ever endured in my life, my life  was dispaired of by many. I lay 40 days upon my bed unabled to set up at all I was adm-  inistered to by the Twelve, and others and my life preserved through the power of God I  took a relaps twice after I began to recover. Once was while in council with the presidency  and Twelve. my strength left me my breath stoped and I felt as though I was struck with  death it was with great difficulty that I was brought to by the laying on of hands. after  my recovery I continued my labours in the printing office. ^Sept 24^ The office took fire  in the upper story in the midst of a large amount of paper and it came near burning ^up^  it to the ground. The winter of 1842 & 3 was one of the most severe ever experienced in  Illinois Nov 21th Alphaus Harmon and his nephew was found froze to death on the  prairie I help to lay them out on the 22nd I remained in Nauvoo attending Councils  Meetings, and the business of the printing office, untill the 7th July 1843, when I was  called to go ^started^ on a mission with the rest of the Twelve ^Elders Brigham Young & G A Smith to go into^ into the Eastern States to collect  funds for for the Temple and Nauvoo House.

On my return home in the fall  as the printing office was out of stock I procured means and purchased a  stock of ^a supply of^ paper and other materials to supply ^sufficit for^ the printing office for more than  a year which I took with me and arived in Nauvoo on the 4th Nov.  I spent the winter of 1843 & 4 in Nauvoo recieved my Endowments with the Twelve  remained in business in the printing office untill the 20th Jan 1844 when I settled my 
 ^closed^ my business in the office and left it well supplyed with materials in the hands of  Elder Taylor.  I built me a ^finished^ ^built a two story^ brick house upon my lot which had been some  two years in building I received a mission in the spring to go through the Eastern  states with the Quorum of the Twelve and on the 9th of May 1844 I took the  last parting hand with President Joseph Smith in his own house in company with  J. M. Grant. He blessed me and bid me God Speed, I left Nauvoo in company  E with Elders G. A Smith J. M.

 The ^W. Woodruffs^ Englands Missions of 1840  Joseph Smith the prophet asked the Lord what   his will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord   answered in a revelation given July 8, 1838  in which the Lord says Let them take leave   of my Saints in the City Far West on the   26 day of April next on the building spot   of my Home saith the Lord, Let my servant   John Taylor and also my servant John E Page   and also my servant Wilford Woodruff and also   my servant Willard patriarch be appointed to fill  the places of those who have fallen and be   officially notified of their Appointment.    It will be observed that different from nearly   all other revelations in the instant a day & date  was given and place was given for the commencment   of this Mission and when this revelation was   given all was peace & quiet And in Missouri & at   Far West but before the time being for the fulfillment  of that revelation The Saints of God had been driven   out of the State of Missouri into Illinois under 
 under the Edict of Gov Boggs and the Missourians  had sworn that if all the other revelations of   Joseph Smith were fulfilled that should not be  as it had a day & date to it and they would see  that it should not be fulfilled. It almost seemed  as though the Lord having a foreknowledge of what  would take place had placed a day & date to  that revelation to see whether the Apostles would  obey that revelation at the risk of their lives  when the time drew near for the fulfillment of  this commandment of the Lord Brigham Young  being then president of the Twelve (As Thomas B.  Marsh had fallen) He called the Twelve together into  [illegible] then at Quency Illinois to see what our  Minds would be about going to Far West to  fulfill the revelation Father Joseph Smith the  patriarch and others who were present did not  think it wisdom for us to attempt it as our  lives would be at stake and thought the Lord  would take the will for the deed But when  president Young asked the Twelve what their feelings  were upon the sub[ject] [page torn] We all of us as in the voice 
 of one man said the Lord God had spoken and  it was for us to obey, It was the Lords business  to take care of his saints and we would  fulfull the commandment or die a trying. According  to our revalation on the 18 April 1839 I  took into my waggon Brigham Young & Orson  Pratt and Father Cutler took into his waggon  George A Smith & John Taylor & George A Smith  On the way we overtook John E Page who was  on his way with his family to Quincy Ill His  waggon had turned over and when we met him  he was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soap  with his hands, we helped him right up his  waggon he drove down into the vally below  and accompanied us on to far west. On the  night of 25 April we arived at Far West and spent  the night at the Home of Morris Phelps who was  still in prison On the morning of the 26 April  1839, Notwithstanding the threats of our Enemies  that the revelation that was to be fulfilled this  day should not be and Notwithstanding that  ten thousands of the saints had been driven out of  the state by the edict of the Governor 
 and though the prophet Joseph & Hyrum Smith  with other leading men were in the hands of our  enemies and in chains & in prison still we  moved on to the Temple Ground in the City of Far West  and held a council and fulfilled the revelation  and commandment given unto us, and among   other things that we performed at this Council we  excommunicated from the Church 31 person who  had apostetized from the Church and turned to be our  enemies. The mission of the Twelve was sung  we then repaired to the South East Corner of the  Temple Ground and with the arrival of Elder ^Alpheus^ Cutler the  Master workman of the building Committee, we  laid the South East ^Club^ Corner of Stone of the Temple  according to revelation there were present of the  Twelve Apostles Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  Orson pratt John E page and John Taylor who proceeded  to ordain Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  to the office of the Apostleship and as members of the  Quorum of the Twelve in the place of those who had  fallen as they had been called by revelation    Then vocal prayer was offered up in the following order  Darwin Chase & Normon Shearer  Brigham Young Heber C Kimball 
 Darwins Chase and Norman Shearer (who had   just been liberated from Richmond prison) were   also ordained to the office of Seventies. The Twelve   then offered up vocal prayer in the following order   Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, Orson Pratt John E Page   John Taylor Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  After which they sung Adam^on^di Aman and then the   Twelve took their leave and parting hand of the following   Saints agreeable to revelation viz A Brother Elias   Smith, Norman Shearer, Wm Burton, Stephen Pecke,   Artemusia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah Granger  Theodore Turley, Hiram Clark, & Daniel Shearer,  Then we took the parting hand of this small remnant   of Saints who remained on the Temple ground to see us   fulfill this revelation of God and commandment of God,   and turned our back upon Far West and Missouri  and returned to Illinois, and we accomplished this mis-  sion without a dog to move his tongue on any man   to say why do you so. We reached Quincy crossed the   Mississippi river on the steem ferry & entered Quincy on the   2nd day of May and we all had the joy of receiving our   families once more in peace & safety un There was an   incident unaccounted with our journey well worthy of record  that while we were on our journey to fulfill the revelation   Joseph the prophet & his companions in chains had got 
 liberated through the blessings of God from his enemies   & prison and passed us not far distant from each  other without either party knowing it, they making their   way for their families in Illinois while we were making   our way to Far West into the hands ^midst^ of our enemies   so they arrived home to their families & friends before   our return. May 3rd was a very interesting day to   me as well as others. In company with 5five others   of the Quorum of the Twelve we rode four miles   out of town to Mr Clevelands to visit Br Joseph   Smith & his family we arrived at his home & once more   had the happy privelege of taking Br Joseph by the hand   two years had rolled away since I had seen his face.  He greeted us with great joy as did Hyrum and   Lyman Wight all of whom had escaped their imprisonment   to gether they had been confined in prison six months   and been under sentence of death three times, but yet  their lives were in the hands of God and He had  delivered them and they were now mingling with their   wives children & friends and out of the reach of the   mob and Joseph was frank open and familiar   in ◊◊◊d our rejoicing was great. No man   can comprehend feel, sens or understand the joy   or sensation that is created by such a meeting 
 except those who have born the Holy priesthood   and been in tribulation for the Gospel sake after   spending the day together with returned to our families at   night. On the day following May 4, we met in conference   in Quincy The prophet Joseph presiding which caused   great joy to all the Saints, much business was done   on the 4, but on Sunday the 5 May Joseph Smith addressed  the assembly followed by Sidney Rigdon & the Twelve   Apostles the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us   and we had a glorious day.    On the following day May 6, I met with the Seventies &   we ordained 60 men into the Quorum of Elders & Seventies  Brother Joseph met with the Twelve, ^Bishops^ and Elders of   Bishp ^Bishop^ Partridges Home, and there was a number with   us who was wounded at Hauns Mill among the number  was, Isaac Laney, who was in company with about   Twenty others at the Mill. A large armed Mob ^fell upon^ and  ^them^ with rifles and other weapons and shot down 17   of the Brethren & wounded others Brother Laney fled from the   scene but the[y] poured a shower of led after him which   peirced his body through and through, He showed eleven  ball holes in his body, there were 27 in his shirt   7 in his pantaloons, and his coat litteraly cut to   peaces one ball entered one arm pit & came out of the 
 other another entered his back and came out at   the breast a ball passed through each hip each leg   and each arm all this was while he was running for   life and as strange as it may appear, all those wounds   with one broaken rib did not lessen his speed  but he out run his enemies & carried his life   we can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power   and Mercy of God, president Joseph Young was also   among the number He also fled although the balls flew  around him like l◊◊d yet he was not wounded How   marvelous are the ways of the Lord    Before starting upon our missions to England   we were under the necessity of settling our   families, And as a place called Commerce  afterwards called Named Nauvoo was chosen   for our people to settle I left Quincy in   company with El Brother Brigham Young & our  families on the 15 May and arrived in Commerce  on the 18th and after an interview with Joseph   we crossed the river into the old Military Barracks  in Iowa, and there took up our alode abode   for our Families, President Brigham Young and myself 
 [page covered] [w]ith our families both went into one room   [page covered] [a]bout 14 feet square. Finally Br Young obtained a   room and moved into it by himself then Orson   Pratt & family moved into the same room with   myself and family, ^A day of Gods Power^ while I was living in these cabins  with in the old barracks we experienced a day of Gods   with the prophet Joseph. It was a very sickly time   and Joseph had given up his Home in Commerce to  the sick and had a tent pitched in his door yard   and was living in that himself, and the large emigration   who had been driven out of Missouri was flocking into  Commerce but had no homes to go into was lying   in the waggons in tents & on the ground and many   were sick though the expenses they were subject to   and Br Joseph had waited on the sick untill   he was worn out and nearly sick himself. But in   the morning of the 22 July 1839 he arose in the  morning reflecting upon the salvation of the Saints   of God in their persecutions & affilictions and he  called upon the Lord in prayer and the power of   God rested upon him mightely and he arose up  ^in the Name of^ as [did] Jesus healed all the sick around him in his day  So Joseph the prophet of God healed all around him upon 
 this occasion he healed all in his house and  door yard Then in company with Sidney Rigdon &  several of the Twelve Heber Kimball & Parley P Pratt who had  just got out of prison accompanied him and he  ^went^ through among the sick lying on the bank of the River  and he commanded in a loud voice in the name  of Jesus Christ to come up and be made whole and  they were all healed and when they had healed all  that were sick on the East side of the river they crossed  the Mississippi river in a ferry boat to the west side  to Montrose where we were. The first home they went  into was President Brigham Youngs who was on his  bed sick at the time BThe prophet went into his  home and healed him and they all come out together  as they were passing by my door Brother Joseph sayes  Brother Woodruff follow me this was the ownly word  spoken by any of the company from the time they left  Brother Brighams House till we crossed the public square  and entered into Brother Fordham House He had  been dying for an hour and we expected each minute  would be his last I felt the power of God that    was overwhelming the prophet of God when we entered  the House Br Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham 
 & took him by the right hand Joseph   [page covered] [hol]ding his hat in his left hand Br Joseph saw  that his eyes were glazed He speechless and uncon-  cious He held his hand in his looking him in   the sp face He says Br Fordham Do you not know  me[?] at first he made no reply but we could all  see the effects of the Spirit of God resting upon him  He again said Elijah do you not know me[?] with   a low whisper he said yes, He then said have you  not faith to be healed, His answer a little planer  was I am afraid it is to late if you had come  sooner I think I might have been, He had the appearance  of a man waking out of sleep, it was from the sleep  of Death Joseph then said do you not believe that  Jesus is the Christ, I do Br Joseph. Then the prophet  of God spoke with a loud voice as in the Majesty of  the GodHead Elijah I command you in the Name  of Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. The  words of the prophet was not like word of man but  like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the House shook  from its foundation, Elijah Fordham leaped from   his bed like a man raised from the dead [to] life and 
 a healthy color came to face, and life was m[an]-  ifest in ery act. His feet were done up in   Indian Mud poltices, He kicked it off his feet and  scattered its contents and he called for clothes put  them on called for a boul of bread & milk & eat  it put on his hat and followed us into the street  to visit others who were sick. The unbeliever may  ask was there not deception in this, if there is any   deception in the mind of the unbeliever There was   none with Elijah Fordham the dying man nor  with those who were present, with him for a few minutes  more he would have been in the spirit world which to day  ^through the blessings of God he lived up to 1880 in which year^  June 24 1880 being 41 years since that event he is alive in the  ^he died in Utah^  Mortal body in Salt Lake City while all who were with   him on that occasion with the exception of two are in the  spirit world, Among the Number were Joseph & Hyrum Smith  Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young Heber C Kimball George A.  Smith and Parly Pratt, Orson Pratt & Wilford Woodruff  are the ownly two living who were present at the time and  we soon shall mingle with those who have gone.   as soon as we left Bro Fordhams we next visited  the House of Joseph B Nobles who lay very low and 
 dangerously sick when we entered the home Brother  Joseph took him by the hand and commanded him  in the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made whole  and he arose & was immediately healed, and while this  was going on the wicked mob in the place led by one  R Mourn had became alarmed and followed us into  Br Nobles Home But before them arrived in the  Home Br Joseph had called upon Br Fordham to  offer prayer and while he was praying the mob entered  with all the evil spirits that accompanied them  as soon as they entered Br Fordham who was  praying fainted & sank to the floor as soon as  Joseph saw the mob in the home he a◊◊◊ and bid  the room cleared of both that class of Men and  ^Devils^ immediately Br Fordham came to and finished  his prayer, it shows what power evil spirits  have upon the tabernacles of men and the saints  are ownly saved from the power of the devil by the  power of God. This case of Br Nobles was the last  case of healing of the day. It was the Greatest Day of  the power of God and of healing members on the Earth  since the organization of the Church and Kingdom 
 when we left Br Nobles, the prophet Joseph went  onto the bank of the river waiting for the Ferry boat  to return back home with those who accompanied  him. We accompanied him to the river  while waiting for the boat a man came to Joseph  Smith of the world, knowing of the miricles which had  been performed he having a pairs of twin children  about 5 months old old and both laying [each]  night unto death aske[d] the prophet of he would  not go and heal them but they were some 2 miles  from Montrose the prophet said he could not go  but after pausing some time he said he would  send some one to heal them and he turned to me  and said you go with the man & heal his children  and he took a bandanna red silk hankerchief  out of his pocket and gave to me and told me to  wipe their faces with the hankerchef when I administered  to them and they should be healed and he said unto me  as long as you will keep that hankerchief it shall  remain a league between us you and me I went  with the man and done as the prophet commanded  me & the children were healed and I keep possession  of the hankerchief unto this day. 
 Chapter 3rd preparing for our journey & Mission  The blessings of the prophet Joseph upp upon our  heads and his promises upon us. The power of the  Devil manifest to hinder our performing our Mission    (on the 1st day of July Joseph Smith & his counsellors Sidy  Rigdon & Hyrum Smith crossed the river to Montrose to spend  the day with the Twelve and set them apart & bless them  before they started upon their missions there were twelve  in number & dined at my House. After dinner we  assembled at Brigham Youngs Home for our Meeting  Br Hyrum Smith opened by prayer After which the presidency  laid their hands upon our heads & gave us a  blessing president Rigdon was mouth in blessing me they also  blessed Sisters Young, Tayler & Woodruff the prophet Joseph  promised us if we would be faithful we should again  return to our families & friends and be blessed upon  our missions and have many souls as seals of our  ministry and returne again in peace and safety to  our families & friends (all of which was fulfilled) Br Hyrum  ordained us to preach the first principles of the Gospel  and thought that was about as much as this genera-  tion could endure. Then Joseph arose and preached some  precious things of the Kingdom of God unto us in the power of the  Holy Ghost some of which I will mention from my journal  Ever keep in exercise the principal of mercy and be ready 
 to forgive our Brother on ther first intimation of repentance   and asking forgiveness for our Heavently Father will be equilly  as merciful unto us also we ought to be willing to repent  of ^and confess^ all of our own sins and keep Nothing back and Let  the Twelve be humble and not be exhalted, and beware  of pride and not seek to excell one above another but act  for each others good and honirably make mention of each  others names ^in prayer^ before the Lord and before our fellow men  do not back bite or devour our brother. The Elders of Israel  should seek to learn by precept & example in this late age  of the world and be oblieged to learn ery thing we know  by sad experience I trust the remainder of the Twelve will  learn wisdom & not follow the example of those who have  fallen. When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christ  stands before the congregations of the earth and they preach  in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the  people are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin and  say that that man has preached a powerful discourse,  a great sermon then let that man or those men take  ease that they do not ascribe the Glory unto themselves but  be careful that they are humble and ascribe the praise &  Glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of the  Holy Ghost priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have power  thus to speak, who art thou O man but dust, and  from whom dost thou receive thy power and blessings but  from God Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel  observe this [FIGURE] key and be wise, ye are not sent out to be  taught but to teach. Let every man be sober be be  vigilent and let all his words be received with Grace 
 and keep in mind that it is a day of warning and  not of many words. Act honest before God & men beware  of sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in whom  you have no confidence be ^honest^ open and frank [illegible] in all  your intercourse with mankind I wish to say to  the Twelve and all the Saints to profit by this important key  that in all your trials, troubles, and temptations afflictions  bonds, imprisionsments and death se[e] to it that you do  not betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your  Brethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God whether  in the bible Book of Mormon or Doctrin & Covenants or  any of the word of God Yea in all your troubles see that  ye do not this thing lest innocent blood be found in  your shirts and ye go down to Hell. We may ever know  by this sign that there is danger of our being lead to  a fall & aposticy when we give way to the devil so as to  neglect the first known duty but whatever you do do  not betray your friend the forg[o]ing are some of the important  instructions given to the Twelve by the prophet Joseph  before they started upon their missions  In as much as the devil had been in a means not [prevented]  by the Twelve going to Far west & returning without la◊◊n it  seemed as though the Destroyer was determined to make  some other affect upon us to hinder our performing our  mission for it seemed that as soon as any one of the  A Apostles begins to prepare for starting they were smitten 
 with chills and fever or sickness of some kind nearly  all the Quorum of the Twelve began to be sick and their   families so it still required a good deal of faith   and perserverance to be exercised in order to start off   on a Mission with the chills & fever. On the 25 July   for the first time in my life I was attacked with the   chills & fever this I had every other day which laid   me prostrate each day my chill was upon me My   wife Phebe was also soon taken down with chills &   fever as were quite a Number of the Twelve I spent 18  ^days^ in Montrose with my family after I was taken sick   before I started upon my missions. The 17 day of August   was the last day I spent at home in Montrose and although   sick with the chills & fever most of the day I made   what preparations I could to start on my ^the^ mission on the  morrow a mission of four thousand miles to preach   the Gospel to the Nations of the Earth and that to without money   purse or scrip with the power of disease resting upon   with a shak[e] of the fever & ague each alternate day but   but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in   him for the recompense of [renewal]. May the Lord give   me grace according to my day and ◊c◊◊s for my [ink blot] [fire] &   a safe return to my family & friends while f◊◊ter [ink blot] ask  in the name of Jesus Christ Amen 
 Chapter 4.   Leaving my family, starting upon my missions  and Incidents upon the Journey    Aug 8, 1839 Early on this important morning I arose   from my sick bed, laid my hands upon the head   of my wife Phebe and blessed her and departed from   her ^the^ embrace of my companion and left her   almost without food or raiment the necessaries of life   she parted with me with this fortitude that becomes   a Saint realizing the responsibility of her compan-  ion. Phebe farewell, be of good chear, remember  me in your prayers, I leave these pages for your   perusal when I am gone, I shall see thy face again in   the flesh I go to obey the command of Jesus Christ.   Although feeble I walked to the Bank of the Mississippi  River there President Brigham Young took me in a  canoe (having no other [company]) & paddled me across the   river I lay down on a side of sole leather by  the post office to rest some Br Joseph the prophet   of God came along & looked at me Well Br Woodruff   says he you have started on your Mission yes says   I but I feel & look more like a subject for the 
 and spent the night with with a Brother Merrills   the day following a Brother Perkins ^we rode 10 miles to Br Perkins and he^ took us in his  waggon and carried us to McComb from thence to   Brother Carloss Smith I rode for hours during the day   over a very rough road of stones and stumps lying    on my back in the bottom of the waggon shaking with   the ague and I suffered much. We held a meeting in   a grove near Carloss Smith and here Elder Taylor baptized   George Miller who afterwards was ordained a Bishop, at   the meeting the Saints gave us $9 & George Miller a horse   to help us on our journey, I rode to Rochester with   Father Coultrin where I had an interview with several   families of the Fox Island Saints which I had brought   up with me from Fox Islands in 1838 I spent several   days with them and at Springfield where Elder   Taylor published fifteen hundred copies in pamphlet   form of a brief schedule of the persecutions ^and suffering^ of the Latter  Day Saints by the inhabitants of the State of Missouri.   We sold our horse and in company with Coultrin Father  Coltrin Br Taylor & myself left Springfield & continued   our journey  I having the chills & fever nearly every other   day which made it very distressing for me to ride in a   lumber waggon shaking with the ague on the 24 Aug we   [rode to] Terre haute and spent the night with Dr Modesett 
 but I suffered much with the chills & fever Elder Taylor  up to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health but  the Destroyer did not intend to make him an exception  to the rest of the Apostles for on the 29 Aug he fell to  the ground as though he had been knocked down seemed to have  fainted away but soon revived but on the following day  it seemed as though the enemy made a powerful grasp  upon his life. He fainted away several times and seemed   as though he would die we stoped several times with  him at a home by the way side we then took him into  a waggon & drove to Brother Horace S Eldridge and spent  the remainder of the day & night [feeding] him and in  the morning Br Tayler recovered so for that he thought  he would be able to ride so we started on our journey  on the Morning of the 30 and we travelled 40 miles to  Louisville and spent the night with the family of Br  James Townsend. We felt terribly shaken up  being in such a weak state Br Townsend was absent  from home but we were kindly entertained by Sister Townsend  in the morning Elder Taylor though very weak felt disposed  to try to continue his journey. We traveled 14 miles to   Germantown was quite sick at night and seemed   to have the Billious fever setted settled upon him  and I was very feeble myself 
 On the day following Sept 1, being Sunday Br Taylor   concluded to spend the day & hold a meeting it was  a German settlement Elder Taylor wished me to speak  which I did upon the first principles of the Gospel  Elder Taylor followed me & spoke untill he was  quite exhausted not realizing his bodily [condition]  we returned to the Inn where we were staying &  stopping I was taken with a chill & fever &   had a sick night and Br Taylor was quite  sick. And the following day sept 2 was a painful  day to my feelings. It was evident that Br Taylor  had a setted fever upon him and would not be  able to travel and Father Coultrin was resolved  to continue his journey and in consultation with  Taylor he thought it better for one sick man to be  left than for two as I was sick with the chills & fever  so that I was not co able to render him present assistance  and not able to take care of myself under these circumstances  Br Tayler advised me to continue with my journey with  Br Coltrin and make the best of my way to New-  York. Accordingly I done so After committing him 
 into the Hands of God though painful I took  the parting hand with him I left him in German-  town Wayne Co Indiana and in the Hands of a Merciful  God and a kind and benevolent family who promised   to do every thing in their power to make him comfortable  untill his recovery, which they did do though he  passed through a severe course of the Billious fever  and was sick night [nigh] unto death but through the  mercy of God he recovered from his sickness and  contiued his journey and we next met in the City  of New York I continued to journey with Father Coultrin  to Cleveland where we parted on the 10 Sept I went  on board of a steamer for Buffalo but was 3 days  and night in a storm before we made the Harbor and  when we did land it was midnight and do so we ran  into a schooner & stowe it in, from Buffalo I traveled to  albany in a canal boat and had a shake of the  ague daily while on the journey. At Albany I took stage  in the night and rode to my Fathers home in Farmington  on the 21st of Sept I had visited my Fathers family  on the in the summer of 1838 on my way to Fox  Islands on my second visit there and I had 
 baptized my father & his household including my step   mother & ownly sister & organized a small branch   of the Church there of nine members eight of which   were my blood relations and I was glad to meet   with them upon this occasion as I found them all   strong in the faith of the Gospel & glad to meet   with me I was still suffering with the Ague   daily. On the 27, Sept my Grand Mother (on my Mothers   side) Anna Thompson died 84 years of age at   Avon, it was a singular incident that she with   her husband Lot Thompson and Mercy Thompson and   Samuel Thompson all of one family died the   year they were 84 years of age I was not able  to attend my Grand Mothers Funeral. On the 4  Oct ^1839^ my uncle Adna Hart died aged 43 years I   had visited him in his sickness and preached the   Gospel to him and he was believing and on his   death bed sent me a request that I would preach   his funeral sermon I had been associated   with him from my youth up I was at the time   having the chills and fever daily afflicted with a severe 
 cough so much so that my Father never thought  I should never leave the home alive but when  they brought me the request of my dying uncle and the  day came for the Funeral, I told my Father to get his  hors & buggy ready for I was going to attend the funeral  He thought I was very presumtious as I had suffered  with the chills and fever some 15 days for and to   attempt to speak in my weak state and to begin  at the same hour that my chill was to come on  was quite alarming to my parents yet according to my  request my [Father] got up his team and I rode with him  and my step Mother five miles through a cold chilly  wind and I commenced speaking to a large congregation  at the same hour still my chills was to come on  and I spoke over one hour with Great freedom  and my chills left me from that hour and I  had no more return from it for many days  On the Monday following Oct 7, I felt sufficiently  returned to health to continue my journey I took the  parting hand with my Father, Mother, & Sister and  left for New York where I arrived in the Morning of the 8th Nov 
 I spent two months & seven days after my arrival  in New York in travelling & preaching in New York  New Jersey & Long Island a portion of the time  with parly & Orson pratt I had freequent attacks  during this time of the chills & fever but I preached  almost daily d on the 13 of Dec I attended a  Conference in New York City with Parly P Pratt  and on that day Elder John Taylor arrived in  our midst and it was a happy meeting he had  passed through a severe time of sickness after we  parted but through the mercy [ink blot] of God had been  preserved and was able to continue his journey. He   also informed us that all of the others of the quorum  of the Twelve had suffered a great deal of sickness and  that it was with difficulty that they could travel    After spending 6 days in New York John Taylor Wilford   Woodruff & Theodore Turley sailed out of New York  Harbor for Liverpool on board of the packet ship Oxford  On the 19th day of Dec 1839 and in the Liverpool docked  on the 11th Dec ^Jan^ making the voyage from New York to  Liverpool in 23 days we took steerage passage 
 which cost $15 each, we had storms & rough  weather, but most of the winds were favorable for  a quick passage while on the passage some Methodist  priest got into an argument against some Catholics  who were in the company, and the arguments of the priests  ran rather more into abuse than sound argument  and Elder Taylor told the Methodist priest that  he did not think it was becoming in a daughter  to find so much fault with the mother as they  did for as the Methodist came out from the   Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the Mother had  as much right [ink blot] to enjoy their religion  unmolested as the daughter had that closed  the argument, our company consisted of 109 saints  composed of Englishmen Americans Englishman sct  schotish scotish, Irish, Welsh & Dutch,  [rest of page blank] 
 Chapter 5 Our visit to preston, our first council  in England, in 1840, we take different fields of Labor    Jan 13, 1840 After visiting ^Mr. George Cannon^ the Father and Mother of G Q  Cannon and the family after we took cars in the  Evening and arrived in the midst of the preston Branch  of the Saints built up in 1837, by Elder Heber C  Kimball & ^Orson Hyde^ Willard Richards and we very soon  had a pleasant interview with Elder Willard Richards  who had remained in preston to take care of the  Churches while the rest had returned home to America  We spent three days in preston in visiting the Saints  and on the 17, we held a council at Elder Richards  Home, in preston, Lancanshire England and after  consulting upon the best plan ^course^ for us to persue  it was finally resolved that Elders John Taylor  and Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool and Elder  Woodruff to Staffordshire potteries & Theodore  Turley to Birmingham his former place of residence  and that Elder Richards go where the spirit might  direct him and that Wm Clayton preside over  the Branch in Manchester. After various 
 principles of the Church had been explained by the  Twelve present the Council adjorned Elder Willard  Richards had been called to be one of the Quorum  of the Twelve but had not yet received his ordination  On the day following I parted with Elder  Taylor & Fielding who wet went to Liverpool &  with Elder Richards who tarried in preston  and Elder Turley & myself went to Manchester  the first time I ever visited that City, I here  met with Elder William Clayton for the first time  as soon as I had an introduction to him  he informed me that one of the Sisters in the place  was possessed of the devil and he asked me to go and  cast him out of her Thinking that one of the Twelve  Apostles could do any thing they were a mind to. However  I went with him to the home where the woman lay in  the hands of three men in a terrible rage and trying  to tare her clothing off from her I also found quite  a number of Saints present and some unbelievers who  hagd come to see the devils cast out as a miricle  wrought. If I had acted my own mind I should [not] [page folded] 
 have attempted to administer unto her with the  company present But as I was a stranger there and   Br Clayton presiding over the branch I joined him in  administering to the woman. But the unbelief of the wicked  present was so great we could not cast the devil out  of her but she raged wors than before I then ordered  the room to be cleared, and when the company left  the home except the few attending upon her, we laid  Hands upon her and I commanded the devil to  come out of her in the Name of Jesus Christ, and the  devil left her and she was made whole and fell  asleep and the next day being the Sabbath she came  before a large Congregation of people and bore testimony  of what the Lord had done for her. We had a large  assembly through the day and evening to whom I preached  the gospel. on Monday morning the Devil not being  satisfied of being cast out of the woman entered a  little child belonging to the woman but a few months  old I was called upon to visit the child I found it in  great distress [unearthly] in its Mothers arms we laid  hands upon it and called the devil out of it and  the evil spirits had no power over the Household 
 afterwards this was done by the power of God  and not of man. We laid hands upon twenty  in Manchester who were sick and they were ^mostly^ healed  On the 21 I arrived in Burslem by coach and  met for the first time with Elder Alfred Cordon  This being my field of labor I stoped and commenced  work Elder Turly stoped in the pottery District  some 8 days then went to Birmingham his field of  labor in preaching baptizing bonfirming & blessing children  I received a letter on the 10 Feb from Elder John  Taylor at Liverpool saying they had commenced there and  baptized 10 person, I labored in the Staffordshire  potteries in Burslem, Hanly Stoke Lane End and  several other villages from the 22 Jan untill the  2nd day of March one month & 7 days preaching  ery night in the week and two or 3 times on the   Sabbath I baptized, confirmed, & blessed many children  and we had a good field open for labor  and many were believing, and it appeared as though  we had a door open to bring many into the Church  in that part of the vineyard 
 March 1, 1840 was my birth day I being 33  years of age. It being on Sunday I preached  twice through the day to a large assembly in the  City Hall in the Town of Hanly and broke bread  unto the Saints again in the evening I ^again^ met with a  large assemble of the Saints and strangers and while  singing the first Hymn the spirit of the Lord rested upon  me and the voice of the Lord said to me this is the   last meeting that you will hold with this people  for many ^days^ I was asstonished at this as I had many  appointments out in that district, when I arose to  speak to the people I told them that it was the  last meeting I should hold with them for many days  they were as much asstonished as I was In the  at the close of the meeting several four came forward  for baptism and we went down into the watter &   baptized them. In the morning I went in secret  before the Lord and asked him what his will was  concerning me and the ownly answer I got was to  go to the South for the Lord had a great work for  me to perform there as many souls were there waiting  for the word of the Lord 
 Chapter 6. My journey to Herefordshire. Interviewed  with John Benbow. The word of the Lord fulfilled  to me. The greatest gathering into the Church known among the  Gentiles since the organization of the Church in this  despensation    On the 3rd of March 1840 in fulfillment of the word  of the Lord to me I took coach & rode to Wolverham-  pton 26 miles & spent the night on the morning of the  4 I again took coach & rode through Dudley   Stourbridge, Kideministon, Stourport, and  Worcester and then walked a number of miles to  Mr John Benbows, Hill Farme, Castle Froome,  Ledbury Hereforshire Mr Benbow this was in  the South of England a farming country, a region  where No Morm Elder of the Latter Day Saints had  visited, I found Mr Benbow a wealthy farmer cultivating  300 acres of land, occupying a good mansion and a plenty  of means. His wife Jane had no children, I presented my-  self to them as a missionary from America an Elder  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been  sent to him by the commandment of God as a messenger  of Salvation to preach the Gospel of Life & Salvation 
 unto him and his houshold and the Inhabitants of  the land. Mr Benbow & his wife wife received me with  glad hearts and thanksgiving, it was in the evening when  I arrived having traveled during the day 48 mils by coach &  on foot, but after receiving refreshments we sat down  together & conversed untill two oclock in the morning, Br  & Sister Benbow rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings of  great joy which I brought unto them of the fullness  of the Everlasting Gospel which God had revealed through  the mouth of his prophet Joseph Smith in these  last days, and I rejoiced greatly at the joyful news  that BMr Benbow gave me, that I was standing in the  midst of a company of men & women over 600 in  Number who had broaken of[f] from the Wesleyan  Methodist and taken the name of United Brethren  Had 45 preachers as ^among^ their number, had Chapels &  many Homes licensed according theto the Law of the land  for preaching in, and this Body of United Brethren were   searching for light and truth but had gone as far  as they could, and were earnistly ^earnestly^ calling upon the  Lord to open the way before them, and send them  light and knowledge that they might know the true 
 way to be saved, when I learned these things I could  clearly see why the Lord had commanded me while  in the town of Hanly to leave that field of labor  and go to the South, for I could could clearly  see in Herefordshire a great harvest field for  gathering many saints into the Kingdom of God, I retired  to my bed with joy & rejoicing after offering my prayer  & thanksgiving to God, & slept sweetly until the  rising of the Sun; I arose in the morning of the 5th took breakfast  and told Mr Benbow I would like to commence my  Masters business by preaching the Gospel to the people  He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed  for preaching, and he sent word through the Neighborhood  that an American Missionary would preach at his home  that evening, the time came, many of the Neighbors came in  & I preached my first Gospel sermon in ^his home^ the home. I also  preached on the following evening March 6, at his home  and baptized 6 persons including Mr John Benbow  & wife 4 of four of the six were preachers of the United  Order ^Brethren^, I spent most of the following day in clean  cleaning out a nice pool of water and prepared it  for baptizing in as I saw many were to be baptized 
 there. ^I afterwards baptized 600 in this pool of water^ On Sunday the 8, I preached at Frooms Hill  in the morning, at Standly Hill in the afternoon  and at John Benbows Hill farm in the evening. It was  a remarkable incident that the parrish Church that  stood in the Neiborhood of Br Benbow and occupied  by the rector of the parrish had but 15 persons  attended his Church during the day while I had a large  congregation judged to be a thousand attended my  meetings through the day & evening, and as I arose in  the evening to speak at John Benbows house a man  entered the door and approached me and informed me  he was a constable sent by the rector of the parrish  with a warrant to arest me I asked him for what  crime, he said for preaching to the people, I told him  I had a license for the preaching ^of^ the Gospel to the people  as well as the rector, and if he would take a chair  I would wait upon him after meeting, he took my  chair & sat beside of me, I preached the first  principles of the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel for  an hour & a quarter the power of God rested upon me  the spirit of God filled the home the people were convinced  at the close of the meeting I opened a door for 
 baptism seven offered themselves, 4four were preachers, among   the number ^offered^ offered for baptism was the constable. He arose &  said Mr Woodruff I would like to be baptized, I told   him I would like to to baptize him, I went down   to the pool & baptized the seven we then met together   and I confirmed thirteen, & broak bread unto the   Saints and we all rejoiced together. The constable went  to the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr   Woodruff taken up for preaching the Gospel he must go   himself and serve the writ, for he had ^heard^ her him   preach the ownly true gospel sermon he had ever   heard in his life. The rector did not know what   to make of it, and he sent two clerks of the   Church of England ads ^as^ spies to attend our meeting   to see what we did preach but they were both   pricked in their hearts, and received the word of God   gladly & were baptized and confirmed members of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the   rector became alarmed & dare not send any body   ^els^ but the Ministers & rectors of the Church of England  of the South of England called a convention and sent   a petition to the Lord Bishop of Canterbury to petition  parliment to pass a Law to prohibit the Mormons 
 [page covered] [fr]om preaching in the British dominions in this   [p]etition the rector stated that one Mormon  American Missionary [had] baptized fifteen hundred   mostly members of the English Church during the last   seven months, but the Lord Bishop & Council understanding   very well, that the laws of England gave free toleration   to all religions under the British flag sent word   to the petitioners that if they [loved] the worth of souls   at least as much as they did the ground where   hares foxes & hounds run they would not loose   as many of their flock. I continued to preach and   baptize daily. On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder   Thomas Kington. He was the superintendant of both   preachers & members of the United Brethren, the first   thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire I had baptized   forty five preachers, & 160 members of the United Brethren  which put into my hands one Chapel & 45 homes   licensed according to law to preach in, this opened a   wide field for labor, this enabled me to bring into   the Church through the blessings of God over eighteen hundred   souls during eight month labor including all of the   600 united Brethren exept one persons it also included 
 some two hundred preachers of the various denominations   This field of labor embraced Herefordshire   Glostershire & Worstershire and formed these Conferences   Garway ^Garway^, Gadfield Elm & Frooms Hill, I was visited   by president ^young^ & Dr Richards, Brother Benbow furnished    us with £300, to print the first Book of Mormon   that we published in England and on the 20 day of May   1840 B Young, W Woodruff & W Richards held a council   on the top of Malv Malvern Hill, and there decided  that president Young go dirct ^direct^ to Manchester & publish   3000 copies of the Hymn Book, & 3000 copies   of the Book of Mormon this being the first of the   publishing of these Books in England. The power of God   rested upon us upon this Mission, the sick were   healed, Devils were cast out, the lame was made   to walk one notible case I will mention Mary  Pitt who died in Nauvoo sister to Wm Pitt who   died in Salt Lake City she had not walked upon   her feet for eleven years we carr[i]ed her unto   the water where I baptized her. On the evening of   the 18 May 1840 at Br Kingtons house in Ledbury 
 Dymock Elders B. Young, W Richards & W Woodruff   laid hands upon her head & confirmed her, Br  Young being mouth and rebuked her lameness  & commanded her to rise & walk in the Name of   the Lord and she was made whole and never   used a staff or cruch to the day of her death   she walked through the town of Dymock next   day which created a stir among the people   but the wicked did not feel to give God the   glory. The whole History of this Herefordshire Mission   shows us the importance of carefully ^listening^ listeninig to   the still small voice of the spirit of God, to listen   ^to^ the revelations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord had a   people there prepared for the Gospel, they were praying   for light & truth, the Lord sent me to them   I declared the Gospel of Life and Salvation unto   them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it   and many of them have been gathered to Zion in these  Mountains and many of them have been called to   officiate in the Bishoppric Bishopricks 
 and done much good in Zion, but for   all these things we should ever acknowledge  the Hand of God therein and give him the   honor praise & glory forever & ever Amen 
 Joseph Smith presided at a Conference held at   Quincy Ill on the 6th May 1839 where it was resolved   that 15 of the Seventies Names given also 5 High priest accompany  the Twelve to Europe only two out of the Twenty fulfilled   the mission. May 9th Joseph Smith left Quincy with his family   for Commerce Ill. on the 9 May and arrived on the 10th &   sleped with his family in a log home nearly all of the Church  who were driven from Missouri soon followed the   prophet to Commerce, Ill. On the 9 11 June Joseph   Smith commenced dictating his History to his Clerks, who   wrote for him. On the 15 May 1839 I left Quincy Ill. and   started with my family for Commerce Ill I ownly drove  to the Committee House & spent the night. 16th Brother Brigham   Young & myself started with our families & drove 15 miles   & camped for the night, and on the night of the 17th, we  camped on the bottom of an open prairie. We arrrived in  Commerce on the 18th, and called upon Brother Joseph   Smith & his family. I also say many other old friends   who had been driven from place to place yet   th[e]y felt well, & were not discouraged but felt to   trust in God. The Saints felt determined to ^try to^ build  up a City wherever they went, Commerce was beautiful  for situations yet there was but two or three buildings  in the town. After spending a short time visiting old   acquaintances I crossed the Mississippi River in a   ferry boat and landed in Montrose Iowa. This   was the first time I ever was in the Terr[i]tory.  Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by the  United States Army. It contained about  12 blocks of  buildings making about 75 rooms in all. After spending  the night in Doctor Gallands office, I moved my family   and effects into a room on the west side of the public  square. This room I occupied untill I started upon   my mission for England and my family occupied it  after my departure 
 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having been  sick for several days, & his home & door yard containg many  of the sick saints who had been driven from Missouri. Joseph  rose from his bed with the power of God resting upon him  and he took the sick by the hand & in a loud voice  commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to  arise & be made whole & he healed all that were  in his house & around about he then took some  of the Twelve with him & walked up the River bank  about a mile & healing all that were sick as he went  along & they were many among the number was Elder  Sherwood who lay at the point of death. He crossed  the River to Montrose went into the home where Brigham  Young lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the  home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was   standing & told me to follow him I did so we  then went into the home of Elijah Fordham who  was at the point of death, his friends had looked  for him to breath his last for several hours, he  had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walked  into the room Brother The Joseph took brother  Fordham by the hand & looking the dying man in  the eyes for several moments. He then said Brother Fordham  in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comand  you to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet  was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole  home shook from its very foundation. And the man  leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously  He kicked his poltices off from his feet, dressed himself  eat a boll of bread & milk & followed us out of the house  I went into the House of Bates Nobles who was also  very sick the prophet healed him & we knelt down & prayed  & gave thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeing  the power of God and followed to see what the end would  be. After the prophet had healed, all the sick saints in  Montrose he with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 to the ferry to return to Nauvoo, a Gentile  came to him & asked him if he would not  go out into the country some two miles & heal  a pair of Twinn Children about 3 months old both  of which were vary sick. He said I cannot go but  I will send a man, who will do just as well. He  Turned The prophet turned to me & said you go  with this man & teach him & his houshold the principles  of faith in Christ then lay your hands upon  the Children & heal them in the name of the Lord  At the same time handing me a silk bandanna  red hankerchief & said wipe their face with that  Handkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keep^ then the prophet returned  ^this Handkerchiaf it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ home & I went & done as I was comma[nded] & the  Children were healed. The deeds of this day showed me more  of the power of God in healing of the sick than I ever  before saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any day  of my life. I still keep the Handkerchief in memory of  the prophet Joseph  [rest of page blank] 
 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met at  Father Cornors & held three meetings through the day and evening  we red in the Book of Mormon, broke bread to the  Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bare testimony to  me that there would be a great work in London  We retired to rest in good season. I felt well in  my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night  I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untill  about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a determina-  tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome  the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by  day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming  this determination in my own mind a personage appeared  unto me which I considered was the prince of darkess  darkness or the Devil, he made war with me and attempted  to take my life he laid hold of me like a strong  armed man, I felt like the wait of a heavy man  lying upon my body and he caught me by the throat  with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death  I struggled with him as one man would struggled  with another I, felt as though this destroyer would overcom  me & that I must die as I saw no way that I could  escape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me  why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help, I then  asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver  me from the power of the Devil & preserve my life  instantly three personages came throught the door dressed  in white with considerable light surrounding them they  came up to the bed side while I was lying in the grasp  of the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & in  the twinkling of an eye I was liberated & the spirit of God  vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls  of my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a high  state of persperation water stood upon ^me^ in drops. As soon  as I could speak I spoke to Brother G. A. Smith &  I found that he had been labering under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been  seeking his life as well as my own, and he was  delivered in the same way. the three personages that  appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think  over sisx feet the other m[i]dd[l]e one was another man was  medium size & the 3rd was a short man they we[r]e all clothed  alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but  as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was  delivered they disappeared, I felt thankful to God for  the presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage record this  in one of the blank pages & refer to the page)  Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and many  other Saints I attended a discussion in the evening held  at the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester. One Mr  Barrett had tried hard for a length of time to get  some of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him, though  his continued teazing [president] Brigham Young told him  the Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject with  him but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonism  he would appo[in]t some body to meet him, as Mr Barrytt  would not take no for an answer Brother Alfred Cordon  was appo[in]ted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was  a beardless boy yet he had been ordained an Elder &  received much of the Spirit of the Lord and they met  for this purpose at early candle light, the Stand was  occupied on one side by my Methodist Priest, & on the  other side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lyted  by 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighthed with  gass there were some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-  self to prove th Book of Mormon false & water baptism  ^not^ essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged  himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & water  baptism essential to Salvation.  As Mr Barrytt arose  & declyaired to the Assembly that he would prove the Book of  Mormon false & water baptism not essential to  Salvation 4 glass chimneys in each of the chanderliers burst 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the Congregation  And the man who had tended the gass in the Hall said  for twenty years said he had never known  any [wei[r]der] of the kind. the chimneys were replaced  & the discussions went on I set by the side of Doctor  W Richards, and at the commencement of the meeting  a very interesting old gentleman appeared in the congrega  -tion he sat at the end of a seat joing the ally near  the platform, He made me think of what he s is said of  the Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & rested  in a large white roll upon his shoulders, he was a noble  looking man he eyed us with great interest &  penetration, he occupied his seat to our view then  some half an hour I called the attention of Doctor  Richards to him we both looked at him with feelings  of both interest, some little disturbance in another part  of the Home attracted our attention & when we  returned our eyes to the seat of our interesting visitor  we found his seat vacant, & he had disappeared  there for the first time we felt that we had been  visited by John the Revelator or one of the three  Ancient Nephite, however the discussion went on  Mr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordon greived  the victory, & quite a number of the methodist who   attended that discussion, was baptized & joined the Latter  Day Saints 
 Autobiography of Wilford Woodruff    The remaining months of  the year 1841 was spent by the  Twelve, after their return from  this successful mission in G  to Great Britain, in settling  their families in Nauvoo and  taking charge of the affairs of  the affairs Church. Several  noteworthy events took place at this  time among which were the  dedication of the baptismal font  in the Temple by the Prophet and  the Twelve and the first adminis-  trations of the ordinance of 
 baptism for the dead, both of  which occurred on Sunday Nov 21st,  1841. A large congregation  assembled and Elders Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball and  John Taylor baptized about forty  and persons and Elders Willard  Richards, George A Smith and  Wilford Woodruff confirmed them.    During the following week  a company of about 200 Saints  arrived from England, and I was  now again in the midst of  hundreds whom I had baptized  in America, the "Islands of the Sea"  and England and Wales. 
 Just before the April Conference  the Prophet administered the  ordinance of rebaptism to the  Church, baptizing many himself,  among whom were the Twelve,  who afterwards assisted him  in baptizing and confirming  the multitude. This was the  first time I was rebaptized. At  since my [ent] the Prophet  Joseph administered  the close of the administration  the Prophet lifted up his hands  to heaven and blessed the   people and the Spirit of 
 God rested upon the congregation    At the April Conference  there were 275 ordained to  the office ^under the hands^ of Elders, Brigham  Young, Heber C Kimball,  Orson Pratt, Lyman Wight,  Willard Richards, George A  Smith and Wilford Woodruff.  offi While these ordinations were  going on Elder John Taylor was  in the stand delivering a  discourse to the multitude,  while others of the Elders were  baptizing and confirming  at the font and elsewhere. 
 On the 23 of July I started  for St Louis to purchase a stock  of paper for the "Times & Seasons"  and arrived at St Louis on  the 2nd of August after a very  uncomfortable voyage during  which I took a very severe  cold which settled into bilious  fever.    See book marks 3

In attendings the Su^n^day School in my  early Boyhood, under Dr Noah, porter and  learning [cler◊◊ts] by heart, I saw what Jesus Christ

 President's Office,  Saturday, October 15 [18]87    Report of a private interview held  between President Woodruff and United  States Marshal Dyer.    After some general conversation,  Marshal Dyer said,—    Well, Mr. Woodruff, I am glad  to see you out and I hope to see more  of you.    President Woodruff — Yes, I considered 
 it qut quite a privilege to get out and  look on the faces of the people at Conference.    Marshal Dyer — There is no need for   you to be uneasy.    President Woodruff — I really don't   think it would add particularly to the   interest of our great government to take  a[nd] shut up, for marrying a wife or two,  an old man 80 years of age.    Marshal Dyer — Of course, that is a   long discussion.  I have always taken  the stand that stringent laws ought to 
 be passed. I think the thing has  been trifled with, and the government   has been criminally liable.  I have  always taken the view that inasmuch  as there are so many people who have  gone into polygamy when they con-  scientiously believed it was right, and  there was no specific law against  it — I say in a case of that kind  that if Congress had said we will let  you go ahead and won't fall out about  it; but any fellow that goes into it 
 now we will punish him so that  it will be a terror to him. Others  have done different; but we are not re-  sponsible for what others did before.    The facts are, that in my opinion all  the people here lost their heads the   last two years. I think that the Gentiles,  encouraged with a little favors that  dropped to them; got wild and ex-  pected that in a moment they were   going to be able to pick up everybody 
 that stood in their way and send  them off somewhere.  On the other   hand, your people were just as stubborn,  and nobody seemed disposed to meet  halfway.    I will tell you, that, as far as  you are concerned,—I have no hesita-  tion in the world; I would tell it to   you on Main Street just as soon as  I would here — you shall not be  arrested, unless the Grand Jury shall  take the case up themselves and indict 
 you.    President Woodruff — Thank you.  Of course, that is a favor; it is a   privilege to walk out in open day-  light and among our people.    Marshal Dyer — Well, I don't know  as there has ever been an attempt for  your arrest. I have bothered less  about your case than any other  man of prominence in the Territory.  I didn't even know who your family 
 was.  I have never looked into the  matter enough to know that.    After some further conversation  which was of an unimportant character,  Marshal Dyer retired. 
 Vision of Farnsworth    On a clear still day about 1 oclock pm about the time of the ringing  of the bell for the Temple Hands to commence work in Nauvoo  All of a sudden the Heavens assumed a heavy gloomy appearance  And the Saints in Nauvoo appeared to be all in confusion and  downcast countenance and the 12 Apostles commenced councelling the  Saints to gather in from the varioust settlements and prepair for a long  journey to the west. They gathered together started in waggons as far as  the eye could reach, after travelling some time the journey seemed  to be accomplished and much easier than was anticipated & matters  seemed to assome a bright & more cheerful appearance and prosper-  ity attended the Saints for a short season. All on a sudden a terrible  dark cloud arose & continued to thicken and grow more terrible  in appearance untill every ray of hope or prospect of escape seemed  to be cut off. At this time the Authorities of the Church all appeared  to be absent. Brigham Young came in suddenly into our midst followed  by the Twelve, & commenced councilling the Saints to be of good cheer  & see the Salvation of the Lord, but by the dark & gloomy appearance of  some the advise seemed to have but little effect & the first I knew  the Church seemed to be gathered together in a circle with 3 strong  Iron Bands around it & Brigham leading the 12 with small  Mallets in their hands like masons mallets they were passing around tapping  and driveing the hoops. This was the first time I noticed the absence of  Joseph & Hyram Smith, and I felt troubled & weighed down on  account of it while Brigham & the 12 were thus driving & tightning  the hoops they appeared to have the most determined, fierce, resolute,  countenances I ever beheld & the Saints seemed to be pressed almost  beyound endurance actually driven to the point of starvation and the  heavens assumed a terrible asspect at this time. A thought aroused my  mind and I was just about giving the utterance to the expression that the Saints  could not stand it any longer when all of a sudden they burst the hoops  asunder and sumthing more than half of them ran like frightened sheep  Just at this moment the black cloud that overspread the Heavens burst instantly  over our heads and the countenances of the Authorities that before had  seemed tyranical & oppressive instantly changed to the most heavanly  & pleasant appearance all our troubles were instantly banished 
 And I could not help giving utterance aloud to the expression  I am glad I stood a moment longer and Brigham took the  company aside into what appeared like a cellar & spread before them  the most beautiful luxuriant feast that I ever beheld from this time  the Saints were of one heart & mind & the power & glory of God  rested upon them & the elements & all things were subject unto them  and as I was contemplating upon the scenery through which we had  past, the spirit of the Lord came upon me & showed me through it, that  it was necessary for the Saints to pass through just such straightened  circumstances & trials in order to sift out those who are unworthy to  enjoy the blessings that we now enjoy, the cloud that first hung  over the Saints rolled off upon the inhabitants of the United States  with tenfold vengance, such scenes of vengance famine pestilance and  bloodshed followed that it is out of my power to describe. The Church  started South for Jackson County Missouri, myself & some other  Brethren were passing through a lane in Jackson Co, we saw a  Missouri mobacratt vary malicious in appearance coming towards us  on the opposite side of the road & when about opposite to us his eye  caught ours he immediately withered & disappeared.  From the [ink blot]  of the dark Cloud to the close of the vision I have no recollection  of seeing any women or children. Amen    [Sideways Text]  Vision of Farnsworth  [End Sideways Text] 
 Revelation given to  Wilford Woodruff, Nov 24, 1889  Salt Lake City 
 Revelation given to President Wilford Woodruff.    Sunday, November 24th 1889 at Salt Lake City, Utah    Thus saith the Lord, to my servant Wilford, I the  Lord, have heard thy prayers and thy request, and will  answer thee by the voice of my spirit. Thus saith the  Lord, unto my servants the Presidency of my Church, who  hold the Keys of the Kingdom of God on the earth, I the  Lord hold the destiny of the Courts in your midst, and the  destiny of this nation, and all the nations of the earth in  mine own hands; and all that I have revealed, and  promised, and decreed concerning the generation in  which you live, shall come to pass, and no power shall  stay my hand. Let not my Servants who are called  to the Presidency of my Church, deny my word or my  law, which concerns the salvation of the children  of men. Let them pray for the Holy Spirit, which  shall be given them to guide them in their acts. Place  not yourselves in jeopardy to your enemies by  promise; your enemies seek your distruction and  the distruction of my people. If the Saints will 
 hearken unto my voice, and the counsel of my  Servants, the wicked shall not prevail. Let my  servants, who officiate as your counselors before  the Courts, make their pleadings as they are  moved upon by the Holy Spirit, without any further  pledges from the Priesthood, and they shall be justified.  I the Lord, will hold the Courts, with the officers of  Government, and the nation, responsible for their  acts towards the inhabitants of Zion. I, Jesus  Christ, the Savior of the world, am in your midst.  I am your advocate with the Father. Fear not little  flock, it is your Father's good pleasure to give you  the Kingdom. Fear not the wicked and ungodly.  Search the scriptures, for they are they which testify of  me; also those revelations which I have given to  my servant Joseph, and to all my servants since  the world began, which are recorded in the records  of divine truth. Those revelations contain the  judgments of God, which are to be poured out upon  all nations under the heavens, which include 
 Great Babylon. These judgments are at the door, they  will be fulfilled, as God lives. Leave judgment  with me, it is mine saith the Lord. Watch the signs  of the times, and they will show the fulfillment of the  words of the Lord. Let my Servants call upon the  Lord in mighty prayer, retain the Holy Ghost as  your constant companion, and act as you are  moved upon by that spirit, and all will be  well with you.  The wicked are fast ripening  in iniquity, and they will be cut off by the judg-  ments of God. Great events await you and this  generation, and are nigh at your doors. Awake,  O Israel, and have faith in God, and His promises,  and He will not forsake you. I the Lord will de-  liver my Saints from the dominion of the  wicked, in mine own due time and way. I  cannot deny my word, neither in blessing nor  judgments. Therefore let mine Anointed gird  up their loins, watch and be sober, and keep my  commandments. Pray always and faint not; 
 exercise faith in the Lord, and in the promises of  God; be valient in the testimony of Jesus Christ.  The eyes of the Lord and the Heavenly Hosts are  watching over you and your acts. Therefore be  faithful until I come, I come quickly to reward  every man according to the deeds done in the  body, even so, Amen.  [rest of page blank]

 Hon A. W. Babbit    Dear Sir    The deep interest I feel at   heart for the general good interest & welfare of the inhabitants   of the State of Deserett at this critical & important crises  is the apology I offer, & the ownly motive that induces me at   this time to address you by Letter. as I may not have a   per[s]onal interview with you which I should be vary glad  to have befoe your arival at Congress Washington   or our petition is presented before Congress, I wish to   suggess present a few items for your consideration. In the   first place I will ^wish to^ say I have not been Idle since I learned  that the inhabitants of the vally had organized a State Governtment   & that you was their delegate to Washington but I   have endeavored to do all in my power to assist the cause  in any way that I could, and I am fully convinced  from what I have learned from various sources & classes  that a most judicious, wise, discreet & prudent cource must   be carried out in this affair in order to secure success  I also firmly believe that you ought not to commit  yourself in the least by taking sides with the democrats  whigs, Free Soil, or any ^othr^ party for by so doing at the comm[encem]ent  of the service I belive it would be certain death, to your   success but take a Neutral groud at first & watch the signs  of the times & then act according to circustances you will   probably meet with the most exciting Congress that ever   assembled in the United States, & the parties are so even bal[anc]ed 
 that to take sides with either party at first would defeat  the Bill altogether, I think have an influential friend who   is vary intimate with the members from Maine who will   use his influence for them to go with for our Bill I have   assisted Dr Bernhisel conc[ern]ing the petition what I could, &   He has had an interview with many influential men &   He has always taken a Neutral ground which I think is a   wise courcse & the ownly safe one at the commecent [commencement] of   this session And I hope you will have an [interviewed]   with him at the earliest opportunity & that you will be   enabled to unite your influece & council together   And my prayer to God is that you may be prospered   in this laudible & glorious enterprise, and that prudence  Wisdom & success may attend you in obtaining a seat for   Deseret in the circle of her sister States is the cincere desire   & warmest wish of my heart    Yours Truly    Wilford Woodruff    P.S. I should essteem it a great favor to meet in Concil   with you & Dr Bernhisel at Washington but do not now  expet to have the opportunity. I should take it as a favor  if you would write me occassoially & inform me of   your progress ^& prospets^ my address is still (Cambridgeport  Mass    WW

 Philadelphia Pa Nov 27th 49    Col Kane    Dear Sir    In my reflections I have thought  there might be some dubiety resting upon your mind  in regard to the views of the inhabitants of the State  of Deseret upon the subject of Slavery in consequece   of their not introducing a clause in there State Constitu-  tion prohibiting Slavery. I think your interesting  visits in our midsts, your travels in our encampments,  your clame of observations in our families Assem-  blies & Councils whare the sentiments of our hearts have  been freely poured out before you must all combine  to convince you that the inhabitants of the State of  Deseret will never sustain in any [wise] the institution  of Slavery in their midst. We are a peaceful and  industrious people have removed to the sequestered vally  of the Great Salt Lake. we do not wish to have anythg  to do with the "vexed question of Slavery" or any of the  other exciting political questions and therefore we deemed  it expedient not to introduce a clause into our  Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves into  the State of Deseret but Slavery can never be  Tolerated there    With Sentiments of the highest Respect  I remain yours Truly    Wilford Woodruff

 Philadelphia Dec 4th    Col Kane    Dear Sir    I called Satudy & Mondy  at your Office to see you a few mom[en]ts I leave  this afternoon for New York.  The subject I wished to  save a few words upon was this I have discovered of late  occasinally a threat made by the Editors of the various  Journals aganst the inhabitants of the State of Deserett  conveying an idea that they are vary Hostile to the Gover[n]ment  & that th[e]y take up & try men for being engaged in  the Missoure war or but I wish it to be distictly  understood that all these things are composed & put forth  at this critical time for political effect in order to  preijudice the public mind & govnmet against us, d[u]ring this  session of congress supposing that the Citizens of Deseret are  at to great a distance to contradict Such any statemnt that  made may be made. and this is the ownly true light  in which such reports should be [considered] let them  eminate from whatever source they may for the Citizens  of Deseret have manifested their attachmet to the goverment &  Constitution of [our] Country by leaving their families  [upon] the prairie & going into the Mexican war at the  call of the preside Excutive of the Nation    Yours Truly    W Woodruff

 [sideways text]  Copy of A letter  written to J M Bernhiel  Dec 5th 49    Boardentown N. J. Dec 5th=49    Brother Bernhisel    Dear Sir    I sent you a few lines last night ^eveneg^  written in great Haste, as the boat was about to start but one item  which I intended to have mentioned was omitted which I con  sider quite essential and which I did not think to mention when I  saw you.  If I mistake not the petition to which the signers names  are attached calls for a Territorial Governmnet if that is the case it  appeares to me that that petition should not be presnted befoe  Congress by any means untill it is altered I think that wise  policy would dictate that the word Territory be not so much as  once named in any petition or address which you have to  lay before congress in the request which is now made at there  hands, but State and State alone the ownly thing we ask for  and with my present feelings I pray to God with all my heart  that sooner than to have a Territorial Govenment given us that  they may not be permitted to give us any ^a^ Govement at all unless  by all means we could have our own Govenor & other offcers  which is a vary uncertain matter, if we could not get a State  would it not be better to withdraw the bill or petitions as  we afterwards could again present a petition for a state while  if we were a Territory we could not do it perhaps for many  years besides all the trouble that would arise from Haveing  officers & polititions among us who would have no interest in our  wilfare I throw these things [out] as they rest upon my mind  for your consideratin this subject is increasing upon my mind  and rests with wait upon me more & more day & night & is uppermost  above all other considerations and I do not know but I feel as much  interested in it as though the whole concern rested upon my shouldiers  for it is not a work merely to aggrandize or set up any one man or set 
 of men to get some paltry office a little salary or a name  but objets far more Noble & glorious are at stake in which  we areall feel an equal interest. Therefore I do not wish Brother  Babbit or Brother Brother Bernhisel should for a momet think  that because I expess my feelings to you upon these matters  freely by Letter that I wish to set myself up to dictate or diret  you in this important trust committed to you from  the proper source in the vally No God forbid, such a thought has  No place in my heart. You must be left free to act  from the instructions you have recieved from the proper  source and who act according to the circunstances that are [presntetd]  before you and according to the best wisdom which God shall  bestow upon you and I pray God that you may be inspired to work  together in union as the Heart of one man. It is quite probable  that any suggestions I ^may^ make to you upon this subject may have been  already been weighed well in your minds & prepared for, if so my  suggestions will do you no harm and if they have not all been considered  and I can do any good in anywise in this important matter I shall be  amply paid for my labour for I am with you both in this glorious  work with all my heart soul & spirit. I discover the House is not yet  organized or speaker chosen. I shall look for Letters from you &  Brother Babbit on on my arival at New York Yours Truly Wilford Woodruff    I have not yet reced those letters from Maine and I would like  to know if you have I recieved your Letter containg the  Ticket of admission into the genarel College I went on Monday it is  certainly one of the most magnificent finished and durable  buiddings I ever visited I also saw the robe you left for the  Col which was a splendid thing give my respets to Brothe Babbit    WW 
 And now Dear Sir permit me by way of conclusion to say that  since you have been at Washigton If I have not written much  to you, I have gone before the Lord & bowed my knees in earnest  prayer day by day and prayed for your success & prosperity in the glorious  cause ^in which^ your are engaged in, also for Dr. Bernhisel believing that you both  [was] doing your best to exhert an influence if not with the same  individuals that it was all lending to the same cause & to produce  the same effects and I will furthermore say that I will ^not ownly^ continue to  pray for your success, But I feel to sustan you with evry feeling  & sentimnt of my heart evy way in my power in accomplishing the  object of your mission ^at^to Washington, and I will endeavor to do  the same for evey agent who goes forth for the benefit of Deseret  under the seal & sanction of her Cetizens.  I will also say that I will  endeovor to be more punctual in answering any communitions  from you than I was in answring your last for I certanly  wish to correspond with you while I am in this Couty I  expet to leave Cambridgeprt about the 1st of April with as  ma[n]y as I can get to go with me to the Bluffs & Vally.

I wrote to him   the evening I ^last^ saw you also sent him another the next   day requsting him to take the word Territory out of the   petition before it was presented at Washington  also remarked that I would rather the bill would   be withdrawn than to recieve a Territory unless we   had the fullest assureance given us by the presidet  that officers of our own choice wshould be appointed   Dr Bernhisel informs me that they are instructed  to ask for a Territory if they cannot get a State   then as a last resort if the State fails we must use   every possible exhertion to get our own officers appoited   and trust the event in the hands of God. I shall write Dr   Bernhisel immediately. I will say I have been enabled to   procure letters of recommendation for Dr Bernhisel to   the Senators and Representatives from the State of Maine   who have promised to [go] for our cause    That peace Health, Strength and prosperity may attend   you is the cincere prayer of yours Truly    Wilford Woodruff

It it's is also often more   difficult to explain many matters and things by Letter writing than it  is in personal Conversation, However I will venture to come to the subjet   you say you have not recieved a letter from "any one haveing influenc  in the Ch[ur]ch" "Or from any leading men in the Chuch" Now I may  not be a proper judge what amount of influence I may have in the Ch[ur]ch  Still I believe I have some and have endeoved [endeavored] to use that influenc for   the general good of the whole to the best of my ability" I write you  a letter by Dr Bernhisel who was going Direct to Washington to cooperate  (as I supposed) with you) for the vary purpose of laying a foudations to Correspond  with you. The following was the closing remarks "I should essteem it   a great favor to meet in council with you & Dr. Bernhisel at Washington   but do not now expet to have the oppertunity" I should take it as a   faver if you would write to me occasinally and infore me of your   progress & prospets" This letter you recieved. On my I also   addressed a short note to you while at New York as a Letter of  introduction of Mr Copway who was expeting to go [Soon] to Washington   you may not have reci[ev]ed it. After being absent from Home on   my Western tour two months during which time I addessed  assemblies of some kind almost every evening during my absence &  tracting constantly by day, I arved home wearried out whae I fo[un]d 
 instead of finding rest I fo[u]nd a vary large nuber of   lying before me some 25 ^[many]^ letters from vari[ou]s parts of the world  among them was one from Dr Bernhisel & one from yourself. I   also had rec[eiv]ed among othr thgs an Epistle from the valley  & Letters from the presidency ^in the valley^ requiring certain things [of] ^me^ my hads   which required me to correspod with the Ch[ur]ches which   I have to do by lettr writing as I have No other way of Communi   cation with them, and Hence I need to write some 50 Letters & mail  last Week and am[on]g [thous] I sent one ^one of that [nuber] I sent^ to Washington which I   happened to write and address to Dr. Bernhisel instead of yourself   as I had Nothing to communicate except what was from the   valley & that I expeted you would both receve before mine  woud arive in the form of a visit from Messers Haywood & Wooley  or by the Epistle, still lest you should not receve it I [send]  it in [my] letter to Dr. Bernhisel, and if ^my^ I had had time   ^had permtted^ I should have ansued both letters, or if I had known that   or even th[ou]ght that it would have made any difference in   your feelings, or that you ^[consdered] you^ was slighted I certainly should   have add[r]essed you instead of him, But such a thought   neer entered my mind. In addressing him or if I had addessed  you upon that subject it would have been the came with me for I   should have Had no othr thought but that one comunicatin to   either of you Concning any News from the valley would have been   Communictated to equally to both, for I had the not the most  distant idea but what you were haveing a free exchange of views &   sentim[en]ts, in a sotcial manner, almost daily, for the Dr Berhisel had  neer hinted any idea contrary to it in any communcation to me. I   wrote to the Dr as We had spent Considerable time in social con-  versation upon a variety of subjects, ^just previous to his going to Washington^ & I should liked to have enjoyed  the came privilege with your self, that is the ownly lettr I 
 have writtenthe Dr ^Berhisel^ Since my return Home.  I Haven got  recieved a letter from him to day by the same mail that  Brought yours. As to ^the^ accusations against me in the phrasologey   of wanton Neglect in not writing you is an accusation that I shall   not recieve for I am not guilty, in in that sense of the word  and I think friends ought to study each othrs Circumstnces  sufficiently at least to lay a fondatiun for reasonable excuses  whae their is any seeming neglect towards us before we ac◊ee  them to strongly. I wrote you a letter to lay the fondation for   a Correspondane you answered it and the following is your closing  remak "I will keep you informed of all matters & things transpiring here  as touching our common Interest," that letter it is true I did  not answer." In this it may hve appeared to you a [seemg]  neglect, still I do not think from that circustanc you   are warranted in taking the strong grounds in which you accuse   me, for in reality I did not intend any neglect whatev◊e  for as I hve already explaned I thoght one Com[mun]icati[o]n   every Western officers ^upon the subjet which I wrote^ would answer for both this in   Connexion with my being overwhelmed is business was the  ownly reasn why I did not write to both, and agn   frm your last sentanc I judged that I should hve reced [received]  anoth letter from you before long. So much I hve [said]  for myself, As conceing Mr Hyde I have ownly to say   that I have no knowledge concing am [any] instructions He may   have recieved from the presidency concing your mission   or any othe Subject any further than what is made public   through the prress. For although I hve been travelling in this   Easten Contry a[mon]g the Chches, for near two years & sent  him many ^a dozen or more^ letters, containg some 60 or 70 subscribers for the Guadan  yet I have [never] as I recollet recved but two commd◊tes 
 from Him of any kind, and that mostly cncing [concerning] a [poer] of Attorny  to collet some mo[ne]y for some powers in Iowey. Yet notw◊hst◊d◊  all this I have not for a momet suffered the spirit of prejudice  or Jealousy to take root in my heart agaist him as though   He was neglecting me or was not interestaed in my welfare   or prosperity, or equally ingaged in the same Common   cause with myself, and I have not felt in the least [to]  [imparte] it to any other cause ownly that He was overwhelmed  in busness & cares.  I am aware there from conversation  with yourself & public papers, that [there] had been a ^former^ differenc   betwng you & Mr. Hyde But since that He has pub[lis]hed  throgh the Guadian that it was all made up & [settletled] &   I had no idea but that you were on the best of terms  But to sum up the whole matter ^of this subjet^ my views are those  That the cause ^in which^ you are ingaged in is of Equal interest to   yourself, Dr Bernhisel, Mr Hyde, myself,  and evy good man  who expets to become a Citizen of the State of Deseret, and I   consider that any man who has any different veiws of this subjet   has a wrong one. Men may differn in politics, I nevr cast  any other vote at the poles in my life, even my Father before me   that I werehve any knowledge of, except a Democrat vote, still &   consider our petition to Congress for a Goverment for Deseret  a vary differet thing from party politics, I consider it are  common cause for all the inhabitants of that Stat whether  [thy] [they] be wDemocrats Whigs or Free soil and I consider any  lawful or legarl influenc extented to eventually give Deseret a   State Gvement to be of interest & worth to her inhabitats let it   eminate from what party it may. This I have given you   my views concering thesee points in your letter that needed explanatin  as feel as I am enabled to do in a communcatin of this ki[n]d a[n]d  I hope it will be satisfactory as far as I am conceed [concerned]. 
 [sideways text]   Copy of A Letter   to J. M. Bernhisel  March 26th 1850    Cambridgepot Mass  Mach 26th 1850    Brother Bernhisel    Dear Sir    I receved your interesting Letter  of the 22nd intat and nothing but a croud of businss has  prevented me from you upon the subjet of which  you speak even befoe I receved yours. I was privileged  with the company of professor O. pratt Erastus Snow & J B.  Wallace on the Sabbath & I convrsed freely with those  Brethn upon the Subject & I find but one spirit & opinion  prevailing amog us & that is, it is far better to withdraw  the petition for the present untill you can consult  your constituents than to receive a Territorial Gove[rnmen]t  with Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize  [ovr] us who has no interest in our welfare it is my  firm conviction that the Citizens of Deserett will sustain  you in withdrawing your petition for the time being  rather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Gov[ernmen]t with the spirit  of restrictions that the present Congress manifest  in disposition to lay upon us. Yes Brothe Bernhisel  watch well the signs of the times in this matter do  not let a n[e]t be flung [ovr] the people of Deserett  to their inquiry they should have the rights of Citizenship  as well as other people. The president has recomede[n]d  in his speach a thought that the people of the Basin 
 would not suffer materially if they did not get  a Territorial Government immediately or something to  that Effect. I am of his opinion I think so to I  think it would be a good plan to take his advise  & withdraw the petition! If we want a Territorial  Gove[rnmen]t we can call for it another session  If we want a State Govern[men]t we will be in  also be in a situation to apply for it if we are  not confined under a Territorial.    Thus you have my views & I pray God to sustain  & uphold you & lead you right.    Mr Babbitt informed me in his last that if  th[e]y gave us a Territorial Govern[men]t at all  they would send Pharaohs to rule over us. I have  expressed my feelings to you in other Letters freely  upon those points I am the same now    I wish to know if this reaches you in safety drop me   a line soon. I shall leave Here the evening of the  9th April via N York & Phila I have altered my  mind about the Northern parte as the lake is not  clear. I had a good time with O pratt  Heywood & W◊ooolly shiped their goods on the shiped Boatna[l]  I also shiped about 20 tons of goods & bagga[g]e on the ship  with them pleae take good ca[r]e of this [sheet]    Yours in the [illegible] of truth  W.

 Vision.    In the winter of 1874 my mind was very much  exercised in regard to the parable of the 12 olive  trees; ##Doctrine and Covenants 101:43-62|doct. & cov.## page 279 old ed.    After a social chat with father Johnson of Belleview  Cave Co. one evening upon this subject we retired.  The vision began by finding myself walking up Main  street, Salt Lake City going north. When I arrived at  Z. C. M. I. drug store, I saw coming from the direction  of the Salt Lake Theatre, soldiers on horse back, two  abreast going westward. They had instruments of  destruction in their arms reaching almost to the  ground, similar in appearance to english fire  engines made of fine brass. They commenced to dis-  mount opposite Kimball & Lawrence's corner and  placed these instruments on the street opposite the  stores extending from Kimball's corner to market  square. I passed them and went unto the market  square. I saw the yard of a large prison with two  iron gates towards me, which were very high, with  arched spiked tops and arched brickwork above  the gates. Between the gates & myself were from  two to three hundred (2–300) of our brethren;  all without hats.  They were very clean & appeared  very cheerful.  In their midst I beheld the prophet  Joseph and his brother Hiram.  They looked very much  pleased and their complexion was very much fairer  than any of the rest. The spirit said to me:  "There is brother Joseph & Hiram, they have come  to meet & welcome the spirits of these, your brethren 
 on the other side of the vail. But the brethren  do not know it, for none see them but you."  At this moment the soldiers came and began  to th take the brethren and lead them on the  sidewalk in front of the stores and before the  instruments above attended to. I soon began to  hear the cries and groans of agony of the brethren  and thought I would take a walk eastward  towards the theatre to see what was going on in  another part of the city. As I turned the corner of  the theatre I found the streets filled with gropups of  gentiles. Fences were broken down and people were  standing in the lots the same as in the streets.  When I arrived at the Gardeau house I saw  a large prison standing in place thereof. The  corner facing the street corner was of octagon  shape with a large door some 8 or 10 feet above ground  without steps leading thereto. I was [saw] an iron door  with visible one inch square headed both from  top to bottom fastened in diamond shape. Whilst  looking at this door, a stout heavy built man  opened it from within and stood on the threshhold  and said these words: They are just doing right, to  kill these damn Mormons, damn them, they ought  to be killed every last one of them. Some of my  family have been silly enough to join them and if  they kill them, damn them, serves them right.  They preach of a resurrection and a hereafter.  I believe when a man is dead, he is done with,  and to hell with him." At the same time  turning about and slamming the door behind him. 
 I thought these were very strange proceedings,  turning to leave, I found that an acquaintance  of mine from England was standing at my right  side. This was a surprise to me and I said to  him: "Helloa, Bob, what are you doing here?"  his  name being Robert. He said: "I am looking on  like the rest of the people." We turned the corner  and walked along Brigham street until we  arrived at Main street. Then continued south  until Kimball & Lawrence's corner. When we came  to the corner, I saw at once that the soliders and  ^civilian^ gentiles were butchering our brethren above  mentioned. It seemed, they had attached the instru-  ments to their bodies and were pumping the  blood out of them, it running into the gutter,  where it froze, until it resembled beef suet in  consistency but in color like blood. The first  man I noticed as being active in butchering was  a gentile. He arose from among those whom he had  slain and the blood was dripping from his fingers ends  and from his coattails as though he had been lifted  out of a pool of blood. I walked along the edge ot the  sidewalk between the dead & the gutter. As I started,  this friend of mine said: "We are Mormons why don't  you kill us?" Which brought a great fear over me,  and I thought of leaving him, for I felt I had not  courage to look over either my right or left shoulder.  When I came to the other end of the row of dead  bodies, he was also there with me and again said  "We are Mormons, why don't you kill us?"  Another gentile arose from a stooping posture from 
 among the dead and said: "Well, if you are, look  here, by hell, if you ain't out of this in two minutes  we will serve you like these." pointing at the  same time with his right hand towards the slain.  I stepped across the gutter and noticed the sun  was standing in midheaven.    The spirit said: "St George is the best place for you."  I started to walk and when I did so I noticed, about  3 blocks square of buildings south of this scene  had entirely disappeared. So I walked across  the ground in a southeasterly direction and passed  the Elephant store and came to the state road.  I had not gone far south, when I came to a broad  canal. I looked for a bridge, then a footbridge, but  could not find any. And the only way of crossing it  was, by holding on to a fence rail, which reached  across the canal on the opposite side of the road.  The moment I stepped on the rail to start across,  my Redeemer stood upon the road ground I  had just left. As we were looking at each other  earnestly, he said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid  to die for my sake, wouldst though?" Which caused  me to tremble and shake before him and say:  "O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I do pray thee,  to give me of thy holy spirit, that I may be found true  & faithful in all things, even unto death."  He again  said: "Thou wouldst not be afraid to die for  my sake, wouldst thou?" And I again answered  "O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I pray  thee to give me of Thy holy Spirit, that I may be  found true & faithful in all things, even unto death." 
 then I walked the fence and put my feet on   the south side of the canal to go to St. George.  At this moment I awoke and heard the clock  strike six (6) in the morning, trembling and in  great fear at what I had seen and heard. I told  my wife all that had transpired and in a few  moments I was again in the society of my Redeemer.  He showed me some things in his hands which he  moved about and said: "Thou seest these, but  the time is up now, but behold, I will show  more unto thee at another time."    All this was given unto me on the night, when  Pres. Young and Geo. A. Smith staid at Belleview  for the last time during Bro. Smith's life on  their way to Salt Lake City.    Part II    In Midsummer of the same year, at St. George,  the following vision was given me:    I found myself on horse back traveling between  Hamilton's Fort and Cedar City going north.  When I arrived about a mile south of Cedar  City, I began to meet the Latter day Saints of  Cedar City coming south with their teams  of horses, mules, oxen, horse men and people  walking afoot 6 and 8 abreast old & young,  male & female between the hind end of a  wagon and the head of a team.  They were walking  because their wagons were overloaded with grain  & provisions. I rode along the side of the train  towards Cedar City. I noticed the people were  very cheerful.  The spirit said to me: 
 "The Latter day Saints are being murdered  in the north for the Gospel's sake and those  that are determined to serve God are fleeing  to save their lives. But we are only going to  be driven to St. George, and there stand still,  for we have been driven all we intend to be  driven, for there we will stand still and see  the salvation of our God or die for Zion's sake."  Then I rode on to the center of Cedar City and  there saw the last man putting the last half  bushel of wheat into his wagon which just  filled the wagon box, and bringing a spirit  of peace to me, thinking that he was the last  man, and that he would be out in a few moments  and that then all the people of Cedar City would  be safe on the road to St. George.    I rode quickly back and overtook the train  outside of town. A thought came to me, wondering  if the Saints would come from towns beyond  Cedar. I turned the head of my horse eastward  & put the spurs to him, and as quick as thought  I was on the peak of the highest mountain  with my horse turned around and looking  north. I saw the road, as it were as straight,  as an arrow from Cedar City to Summit,  filled with teams, wagons, horsemen & people  walking afoot, just about to enter Cedar City  when Cedar City people had just left on the  southern side. Thus ended my vision.    Witness to signature:  Hermann Tascher    Your Bro in the Gospel  James Booth 
 A Vision,    As seen by Newman Bulkley, on the night of the  8th January, 1886, in Springville, as related by himself.    I retired to rest about 9 o'clock in the evening.  In a short time I drowsed off to sleep, and it seemed  as if the spirit of my dead wife was hovering 'round  about me. Suddenly I awoke and sleep departed from  me, and the vision of my mind was opened, and I  beheld the members of the Senate of the United States,  while in session, they were hurled from the Hall by  an unseen power; they rallied again, and the second  time were thrown from the the Hall; they rallied the third  time, and were again thrown from the Hall with such  violence that a great number of them were killed; all  those that remained alive had the name of Edmunds  printed in their foreheads. Next I saw a whirlwind  commence in the centre of the House of Representa-  tives, which increased until it frightened all the mem-  bers out of the House, and they then scattered to various  parts of the United States, and the inhabitants of the  city of Washington became frightened, and scattered, un-  till the city became almost desolate. Then I saw a great  tumult commence all over the United States, which  ended in a great deal of blood being shed, and a great  many of the people that had heard our Elders preach,  and had believed what they had heard, but had not had  the courage to embrace the Gospel when they heard it,  gathered up what little effects they could take with them, 
 and came to this people in the mountains. Then I saw  many thousands of women and children take refuge in  the timber, hazel rough, ^brush?^ or any place where they could  conceal themselves from the turmoil that was going on  in the States, and when the word reached this people of  their situation, there were hundreds of the Seventies call-  ed upon to go and hunt them up, and bring them  to this people in Utah. Then the Government of the  United States patched up their difficulty, and elected  a new congress, which assembled again to do business.  The crusade still continued against the Latter-day  Saints. Our enemies attributed all their troubles to the  Saints, and the crusaders raised such a howl and sent  forth their petitions to Congress, that the first business  they did was to order one hundred thousand of the best  and most able bodied men that could be obtained  to come against us. When this became known to the  Saints, instructions were sent forth for all of the inhabi-  tants of the Territory to gather into valleys, as near as  possible to the Temples, and the people gathered into Salt  Lake, Cache, Utah, and Sanpete Counties, and to St. George,  until there was a family to nearly every acre of land,  and all the country around was filled with our people,  and water broke forth where before there had been no wa-  ter, so that all the land could be cultivated. I saw also,  that all the old men who had honored their priesthood,  became spry and young again. I also saw that the greater 
 number of those that had gone into polygamy for the  principle thereof, had to go to prison, while those that had  embraced if for lust escaped, as the officers appeared  to care nothing about them. I saw no preparation of  any warlike demonstration in the midst of the Saints,  but all appeared to have the spirit of peace and con-  tentment, and when the soldiers came near our borders,  then the United States officers and all the Gentiles were  seized with fearfulness, and left in haste by night and  by day, until they all got outside of the borders of this peo-  ple, and united with the soldiers. Then the army surroun-  ded this people on every side, and there was no possible  way of escape; they then raised their standard and sent  forth a proclamation to all who wished to save their  lives to come to them for protection. About one third  of our men, and as many women as they could per-  suade to follow them, went over to the army and joined  it. Then I saw the preparations commence for the entire  destruction of the Saints, which consisted in their ene-  mies gathering together all the combustible material they  could obtain, making a complete wall all around this  people. It looked to me to be some fifty feet high,  and from six to ten rods wide on the bottom. During  the time of their gathering this combustible material, our  people were laboring in the Temples, endowing men with  the fulness of the blessings of the priesthood, setting them  apart, and placing them along the borders of the Saints 
 for their protection, and when the enemy had fired their  combustibles, these men, endowed with the holy priesthood,  walked along like sentinels on their posts, and waved  their hands, and the flames, and smoke, and ashes, that  were intended for the destruction of the Saints turned up-  on our enemies, and when this combustible matter was  consumed and the fire and smoke had cleared away, lo!  and behold the enemies of this people were not to be  found. During all this time, our people were laboring  in the Temples day and night, endowing the Elders of  Israel with the fulness of the blessings of the holy priest-  hood, until they had got the number of fifty thousand  endowed. The Temple in Salt Lake City, during this  time, had been completed, and in one of the rooms,  situated in one of the towers, Jesus and Joseph, with  their councils, were setting. Then preparations were made  for the fifty thousand to go down to the Centre Stake of  Zion, with Jesus and Joseph at their head, riding in  their chariots of fire; they seemed to be somewhere about  from six to ten rods above the earth. While all these  scenes had been transpiring, the remnants of the land had  gathered in from all quarters East of the Rocky moun-  tains, and some had come from South America, and  when our brethren passed down to the Centre Stake of  Zion, the remnants went forth and redeemed the land  of Zion. I saw the foundation ^of the Temple^ laid there, which had the  appearance of a bright lustre. The chariots or pillar 
 of fire remained over the Temple Block, giving light  to those who remained below. When any attention was  drawn back again to the mountains, I saw that the young  men and middle aged had been called away upon dif-  ferent missions, and the old men and women and chil-  dren had to do all the farm work, and all those who  were laboring to build up the city of Zion in Jackson  County, had to be sustained from these valleys, with the  exceptions of the remnants of the house of Jacob. The  buffalo and other game had returned upon the plains,  to feed them until they could be taught the art of agri-  culture. The earth in the valleys was sanctified and  cleansed, so that it brought forth in its strength, and  instead of its bringing forth from 15 to 40 bushels pr.  acre, it brought forth from one to two hundred bushels.  The water broke forth in parched ground, and all these  valleys were filled with Saints of the Most High, which  had gathered in from the nations of the earth to be school-  ed in the Temples that are now built ^and that will yet be built,^ to prepare them to  go forth to the Centre Stake of Zion. I saw all this  pass before the eyes of my understanding, and when it  had passed once, it was repeated again, which occupied  about the whole of the night. I turned over and tried to  sleep, but sleep had fled from me, and soon it was  daylight. I was not asleep, but was awake during the  whole time, and I arose filled with the glory of what I  had seen resting upon me. 
 (A Dream) Dreamed by a Sister  In Franklin    On the night of Oct 8th 1883, I dreamed that  I, with my husband, my parents, and his parents, with  many of our friends, was in the meeting house, attending a  party, where all appeared to be enjoying themselves, more  in social chat than dancing. I was standing alone near  the steps leading to the stand, when I saw one of the brethren  sitting near the first window, on the south side, turn and speak   to his wife, who was sitting near him. She immediatly called  me, and bade me look out of the window at the heavens which  were filled with writing. I was very much frightened at what I  saw, and screamed, bringing the whole assembly to witness the  scene. I saw in the Central portion of the sky, visible from the  window, a scroll, on which was written in letters, 15 or 18  inches high. The passage, (Enter ye in at the Straight gate)  to the north of this was written, (The law shall go forth out  (of Zion, and the word of the Lord, from Jerusalem,)  also, (Except ye become as a little Child, ye can  in no wise, enter the Kingdom of heaven)  To the south was written, (Prepare ye, Prepare ye, the  (way of the Lord) Zion shall be established  (In the tops of the mountains) The earth is the  (Lord's, and the fulness thereof.) Judgments are  (to Commence at the house of the Lord  also. (The Lord will Comfort Zion.)    These passages with many others, some of which I have never before  seen, were all grouped around the first one given, which was the  only one placed in a scroll, and the others, were in smaller letters,  also I saw, Search the scriptures, for in them ye 
 (think, ye have eternal life) (Judgments are  about to be poured out upon the nations,)  Repent ye, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of  heaven is at hand,) Every bit of the space in the  heavens, was filled with writing, and I thought was seen by every  person in the Hall. I thought I turned and asked some one standing  near, what could be the meaning of this, and if it could be, that  the Savior was to appear. And as I turned, the walls of the building  were written on in numerous places. At the west end, was written,  (And a little child shall lead them, )  and further along, (Except ye become as a little  child, ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdon)  It appeared that the stove pipe was in the center of the room, At  the west end of the house, and on it was written, on the north side,  Blessed are the meek) near the stand, so that the  name would be partly on the stand, was written in a sort of a bracket,  and like the scroll in the heavens:    (Render Obedience to your Leaders)    As I stood looking at this, I saw the name of the Supt. of our  Sunday School written, but in smaller letters. I felt to wonder, why  his name was the only one written, and was deeply mortified on account  of it. I waved my hand towards the name, and he looked, and saw his  name with a feeling of thankfulness. The name disappe^a^red without been  seen by anyone, but the two of us. Every one appeared to be greatly  excited, and very much frightened at the wonderful scene. I  turned and spoke to a friend, wondering if the saints who saw Angels,  In the Kirtland Temple, felt any of the awe, and fear, which prevaded  this gathering. We all gazed at the writings for some time, and then 
 went to our homes, and stood in groups talking in the streets.  There were many passages of great beauty, that I never saw before,  that have passed from my mind. I can now in my mind, see the  letters, but it is as though a vail was drawn, through which  I cannot distinguish them.  [rest of page blank] 
 height I could see a great distance, and  the Saints were completely surrounded and no way  of escape apeared. I found myself carried forward  on the back of a noble steed, which caried me over  every barier unhurt, much to the shagrin of those  who oposed the church of God. All at once I beheld  the lightness of a day whose light was beyond the  brightness our days, yet, soft and beautiful to behold  and all apeared hushed. I there beheld men  who ^wonce^ belonged to the "who wonce belonged to the  church" in company with the wicked, they  had joined in helping to build up a  barier or high wall to prevent the escape of  of one Soul, and so well did they gaurd  and cary out their plans that the Saints were  completely surrounded and escape apeared  imposible. I then beheld a large multitude of  Saints gather together they stood very close together  from what apeared to be a pressure from  without, in the midst of the vast multitude  of Saints "who apeared to be clothed in white robes" the  twelve stood up, with our beloved president  John Taylor in their midst, the twelve were  calm but strong in the Lord, and clothed  with power from on high and this power was  made manifest, even to the dividing asunder  of those who were oposed to the Church, then  came a great struggle, and as soon as  the fainthearted and those who had joined the  wicked saw the power of God they feigned  friendship but the day had passed. 
 the power of God manifested itself among  the whole Preisthood and deception was  imposible and many were destroyed by the  Servants of the Lord, because they could desern  by the Spirit all that were true to the Kingdom.  I saw one man who, when he discovered the power  manifested, he drew near to a brother, and said,  I am a Bishop but it availed nothing, he  had associated with the enemies of the Church  and he met his distruction. I felt the final  triumph had come and I was led to exort  the Saints to gather around and sustain the  authority of god vested in the twelve for in  it rested our Salvation. I lay upon my bed  for some time meditateing upon my dream  I was impeled to arise and write the above  and my prayer was that the Saints may  be awake and not be fainthearted, our  enemies will triumph for a season, but  blessed is he who shall continue faithful to  the end Amen    Thomas Harris    [rest of page blank] 
 Womans Dream    The Dreame    I looked and beheld in the  East just above the mountains  a beautiful city in the clouds  of heaven the cloud was  perfectly smoothe and of a bright  pink coler and sloped East  from the bottom to the top  so as to give me a plain view  of every house in the city the  houses was all of a beautiful  cream coler but difered in  sise and workmanship each  house had steaples pointing  to the sky and there was lovely  windows boath in the mane  building and the steaples a bove.  And while I looked I called the  attencion of some one that  was near me to this city  and and I thaught they said no  it is not a city but a fleete of 
 ships. And while I was looking  with all the powers I had to  see something that resembled  a ship. Behold I see a heavenly  messenger a Boy a bout 12 or 14  I should judg by the size and  his face was turned westward  and he came from that city  in the clouds to the Earth  and while he was in the air  a bout 50 or 60 feet a bove the  Earth he had in his hand  a piece of paper a bout 12 x 20 inches  which resembled a show bill in  forme and had blue letters   printed uppon it he held it  in his wright hand and  waved it to and fro as if  heralding something to the  whole Earth then he turned  it loose and it fell to the  Earth some one picked it up 
 and I read a few words that  was uppon it but they were  gon from me when I awoke  and in a few moments this heavenly  mesenger came and stood uppon  the Earth I thought he sood in  the main road runing from  Salt Lake City to Ogden he turned  a direct Southerly couras which  would lead him past my gate  I thought the house in which  I lived fronted the South with  a small picket gate in front I  went to the gait to meet the  messenger and when he came up  he asked me where a certain man  lived whose name I do not  remember and I told him the man  lived in the second house south  of mine and asked what is  your name little Boy he told  me what his name was 
 which I do not remember he  said I am such a mans son  and that he him self had  died some time a go I thought  it was his father that he was  looking for I do not remember  the names I went with him to  the house in which I thought  his father lived but when we  got there we did not see eny  man but there was an old lady  in the house that was very sick  near unto death and the heavenly  messenger told the young ladyes  that was taking care of her that  if they would get a certain  amount of 2 kinds of drugs  and mix them to gether and  give it to her she would 
 get well but said he after  she has taken it she will  look exactly like she was  dead but said he you need  not have eny fears she will  recover. I did not see her take  the medicien but seen her in a   shorte time after she had taken  it and she looked exactly like  a dead person all the signs  we could see of life was her  throat would rise and fall  when she breathed and large  drops of perspiration on her  face. And while we was there  this heavenly messenger with  all the solimnity he posessed  told all that was presant of  the comeing of our Lord 
 and Saviour to the Earth to  rule and rain in wrighteous  ness but I do not remember  what his language was nor  the exact time he [said] the Saviour  would come but it has left  the impression uppon my  mind that it is close at  hand eaven at our doors.  you have the privolige of  printing the dream and the  Interpretation there of in the   Juvenile if you like. if not  please send the Interpretation  to J Owen Roy Utah  and oblige your sister in  the Gospel of Christ  [rest of page blank] 
 Mr. Phippen    Sir believing you to be familliar with the word  of God & considering you willing to instruct your inferiors uppon  spiritual subjects, & after forming such conections of your character  I take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &  instructions as I have no other motive in view, & should you  not consider it beneath your notice to answer my questions  by writing but give me your opinion as you have formed it  from the word of God it would be highly interesing to me    The 1th is respecting the gifts that were in the ancient church the gift of  healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils &c.  2th the Sabbath & its changes.  3th & last is the subject of babtism. Firstly, while perusing  the sacred volumen of inspiration I find many wonderful works  were performed by our Saveiour and likewise by the apostles though not  by their own power but by faith in & through Jesus Christ  & if I mistake mot when Christ first sent his disciples to preach  the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of israel he commanded  them to heal the sick cleanse the lepers rase the dead cast out devils &c  S. Mathew. chap. X [Matthew 10] again in the last chapter of S. Mark [Mark 16:14-18] Christ appeared to  the eleven as they sat at meat & gave them a varry forcible command  to go into all the world & preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that  believeth & is baptized shall be saved & he that believeth not shall  be damned & these signs shall follow them that believe in my name  shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues  they shall lay hands on the sick & they shall recover &c this apparently  was the last command given by our saveiour before he assended to  heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when & whare  were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find  no scripture satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away  theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient  days & likewise should people at this day live as did the apostles & exercise  the faith that did Abraham in offering up his son Isacc that those gifts  might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might  loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of  flesh. we read of a woman that was ill that had suffered many things  of many Physicians & had spent all that she had & was nothing better but  rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. [Luke 8:43-48]  should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent  day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord  told Ezekiel their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house  of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information    (the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy mowithstanding they would not hear  & ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) 
 secondly; with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regard  the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared  to Moses on the mount he commanded him to keep the seventh  day as the sabbath & not to labour on that day, [##Exodus 20:8-11##] so it appears that   if their has mot been a change of the sabbath we as a body are not  keeping the day that we ware commanded to keep still it is held up  to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it mot  allowed that their has mot been no change in any of those commands  that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the bsabbath was  given & why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands  remain good & sacred & while we are under them & ought to obey them  it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week & that  the work of Redempttion was greater than the work of creation & this they  appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully  peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurrection of  Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on  the seventh day as first, & even did Christ really rise on the first  day of the week does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath  & if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their  mot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the  evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was  then perfected. sir this is a subject that has some length of time  ocipied a seat in my mind & I lay it before you considering you  have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself & would  wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood  the scriptures to be verry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath    the third & last is the subject of  babtism & it is a subject to that has long lain with wait on  my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge  to take the word of God & make it the man of our council & form  our principles theirby still we may benefit by the instruction of  those that are more experianced than ourselves I for one Consider  myself transacting business for Eternity & I believe that Jesus Christ  sat the example for the pilgrain to follow & I believe that the christian  ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough  I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost  overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the difference  of opinion & principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects  when we have all the sane bible to read the same spirit to direct  but more especially uppon the subject of babtism. my mind has  long been seleled with regard to this subject still I have remained  silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that evry person ought to  be fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much depends  I had the ordanonce of infant babtism administered to me but it does  not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support  it from genesis to revelation 
 & if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mysterey  to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding   up the light of the gospel & still continue in so gross an error with  respect to babtism. for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account  of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance  of babtism  untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered  them true believers & that appeared to be all that was required of them  in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son  of God & if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believers  & respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no  room for one a moment to doubt but that our saveiour was buried  in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized  ware buried with Christ in babtism & setting aside evry other example  but the one that Christ left us that alone ought to be sufficient  to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite & ownly mode  of babtism (to use the language of Dr Daddridge Jesus had no sin to  was[h] away & yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make  it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him & this ought to silence  evry objection to the practice)    many advance the argument  that those things are not escential but may we mot with the same  propriety say that when Abraham was called to offer his son Isaac  that it was not essential whether he offered his son or a lamb out  of his flock & who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord would  have received Abrahams offering with a blessing & given a blessing in  return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, & why should any believe  that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for  babtism as to follow the example that our saveiour hath given  has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ & if mankind ever  enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him [##John 14:6##] isf so  then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts  & not climb up some other way.    Mr Phippen as I am  convinced of the mode of baptism, & believe it to be essential to  my prosperity & happiness the information that I wish you to communicate  to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle & discipline  to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be  proper subjects without joining the Church for I at preasent am not  prepared to unite ^join^ with any church still I feel it a duty to be babtized  & would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity   I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject  but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized & I  have rather been waiting for him. sir I have ^not^ intended any harm  by asking those questions & I wish you to excuse all you see amiss in  my remarks & by answering me you will confer a great favour  uppon Willford Woodruff 
 Communication to George  Phippin by Willford Woodruff  Jan 1831 
 Beloved Parents – I am now about to leave my parental  paternal roof for a while but I know not how long – but   not without grateful feelings for the kindness which I  have received from my infancy untill the present time, –  but Providence seames to order it otherwise now than it has   been. Let us commit all these things into the hands of   Providence and be thankful that we have been permitted  to live togather so long under so favourable circumstances  as we have, believeing that all things will work for our good  if we love God supremely. Let us realize that we can  pray to one God which who will hear the sincere prayers of  all his creatures and give us that which is best for us.  May we strive to have that spirit in us that raised Christ   from the dead that our mortal bodies may be quickened and  come forth in the morn of the first resurrection to reign with  Christ a thousand years where parting will be no more.   Glorious thought may it ever stimulate us to be diligent in keeping  all the commands of God and not count our trials here too much to  gaine such a prize. Mother, I believe it is the will of God  for me to go to the the west and I have been convinced that it has been  for a long time. now the way has opened and you seem to be  reconciled to it which is the greatest conslattion to me of any  thing earthly; I believe that it is the spirit of the Lord that  has done it which is sufficient for all thing. O be not anx-  ious for your child the Lord will comfort me, I b^e^lieve that the Lord  will take care of me and give me that which is for the best. If it  is for the best for me to go there and lay down this body I think  I feel willing and what matter is it where this body lays untill  the resurrection when I hope and trust ^that^ we shall all rise Above  all the trials of this life. Let it not be to you as though I h^a^d done  some crime and was obliged to leave my home which would be far worse  if I know my hart I can say I go because my Master calls – he has   made my duty plain; Believe not that all these things [a]re against you  for they are not, although the ways of Providence seem dark; I shall come  home to see you the first suitable opportunity whither I like or not

 My dear Brother.    I have but little spare time,  But I will exppropriate these first few moments  which I have been able ^to^ catch from my num  erous calls–to answer your very interesting  questions! Let me say to you I am [please] you  took the liberty to propose them. I shall al-  ways be ready to listen to any similar re-  quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.    Your first question respects the Sabbath  & its change.    GOD having finished his work of Creation in six  days, ceased [and] rested therefrom on the seventh,  & set it apart for the more solemn worship of him  self by men. & as an emblem & pledge of their eternal  blessedness. Gen II 1. 2.    The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath. though  we have no particular account of it.    The "End of days," when Cain & Abel offered their  oblations & The day when the sons of GOD met together  in Jobs time, doubtless were Sabbath days. Gen -IV. Job I - 6  & II. 1.    When GODs ancient people were fed with Manna from  Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a double  portion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbath  which should be gathered & that none should be gathered  on the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. Exodus. 16. 23 
 Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re-  garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai.  But to mark the perpetual & universal obligation  of the observance of the Sabbath, GOD proclaimed the  law of it from Sinai [&] wrote it in a table of stone,  along with the rest which are allowed to be moral;  Exodus XX 8-11. Injunctions to keep it & threatenings for  the breach of it, are every where found in the law &  the prophets.    The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation.  How is it changed from the seventh to the first day  of the week?    In answering this question I would observe  I. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh part  of his time, rather than any particular day.  It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, kept  the same day which they kept after that event.    Nor is it certain that the same cronology was obser-  ved at the giving of the law at Sinia–which had  been observed before & after the flood.    But however Cronology might alter–A seventh  part of the time would be the same in all ages.    II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORD  of the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from the  seventh to the First day of the week.    To mark the devine authority of this change,  he on that day, made repeated visits to his de-  ciples - John XX. 19. 26. On that day he bestowed the mirac  ulous gifts & graces of the Holy Ghost - Acts II - 1. 
 III This is called the LORDs day.  The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christ  arose & to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation   says–This is the day which the LORD hath made  let us rejoice & be glad therein.    John the Revelator calls the first day the LORDs  day - Rev - 1 - 10.    IV The primitive christians met for public wor-  ship & made their collections for the poor on  the first day of the week. Acts 20. 7. Cor - 16.  They also met on the evening of the first day  of the ^week^ & their devine LORD repeatedly met  with them.    I close these remarks by observing–That there  is an alarming laxness among christian pro-  fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. & that  we might all awake to righteousness, on this  subject.    In answer to your second question ofn the   subject of miracles–I answer in general,    I. Miracles were wrought for a definite  purpose in the Apostolic age–summari  ly to establish the devine authenticity   of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus.  That object has been accomplished. The evi  dence arising from miracles a lone, is clear 
 convincing & overwhelming.    II If we should exercise strong faith in GOD, and  live at the fountain head of holy influence  that is–should we watch unto prayer, and   pray without ceasing–should we daily fear  to sin & daily deny ourselves & take up our  cross & follow christ–should all professors  of religion persue this course–doubtless a  wonderfull change would be effected at  once in the state of the church. but even  in that case I do not see that the church  would have any authority to attempt  to perform such miracles, as were performed  in the Apostolic age.    They doubtless would shed their holy  influence all around & be instrumen-  tal in the conversion of thousands of souls–  & the glorious Gospel would be spedily  be preached to all who dwell upon the  earth. For christians would feel that  all they possessed is christ's & they would   most cheerfully devote themselves their  time, talents, property, privileges,  spirits, souls & bodyies– with their present  all & all they ever expected–to the  service of their dear LORD & Master.  Let us pray fervently my dear brother, that    the LORD would hasten this glorious state of  the church.    Then will the deciples of Jesus be instrumen-  tal in performing as great or greater miracles  than did the Apostles.    As it respects your  III. Question. I would observe that it  is in my view, always desirable that those  who are baptized should join a church– an  evangelical Church. But I am ready to  baptize all persons who apply to me to   administer that ordinance–provided they  give evidence of evangelical piety.    That the blessed saviour would direct  you alway & into all truth & finally bring  you to glory is the prayer of your  friend & brother.    George Phippin.    Willford Woodruff.

 Kirtland O. January 4, 1836    Dear Brother    Yours came to hand 8 or 10 days  since. I hope you will pordon me for not  writing sooner, for I feel that I have a just cause  to be excused. And this because of a multiplicity of  business.    The Hebrew School commenced this day, and I  hope that I shall be able to attend it some, but  out of necesity I will be excluded part of the  time because of the press of business.    You have no doubt an idea in regard to  the endowment and if you should suppose that  God intends to endow a man to destroy another  because he repents not, I would inform you that  your idea is incorrect, but I presume that you  have no such an idea. God will indow no  man except he has obtained wisdom and under-  standing enough to use power with discretion  and according to the will of God. I presume  the solemn assembly will take place in Febru-  ary if there will be no hinderance in the comple-  tion of the house.    I have written a letter to br Seth [Willey], and  no doubt you have seen it ere this, had I  time I would write a long letter to you. But  I have not. And Elder Parish wrote you and  you have the Bible Book of Mormon & Book of  Covenants these together with the Sipirit of God, will  will make you wise unto salvation, and give you  inteligence to lead others into the mansions of   bliss. I am sensible that you feel your weekness  in the midst of a gainsaying and idolotrous generation  while in the days of your youth, and so for pain  your brethren ^the [prophets] &c^ But be not dismayed trust in God  and you shall not be confounded, for remember  what our Savior saith of the the Ravens, and of the  Lillies of the field, they toil not neither do they spin but 
 our Heavenly Father clothes them, and will he not  do as much for one of his Young servants; yes  verily he will clothe them with wisdom and inteligence  that they will be able to confound the wise. God has  said he would choose the weak things and the unlearned  to bring about his works in these last days. Therefore,  comfort yourself with the above sayings and many  others that time would fail me to enumerate, and they  are familiar to yourself, continue to be faithful and  the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob shall be your guard  and your defence and your suporter in every time  of need. Keep yourself unspoted from the eviles of  this generation and you shall be blessed forever  amen.    I have complied with your request in regard   to sending extra Nos. of Star & Messenger.  I have forwarded J. Chumbly 5 extra Nos of Reprinted  Star. And A. B. Wilson four.  And Levi Taylor 3 Nos. of the Messenger.  — Isaac Hendrix 2 — — — —  — Daniel Thomas 2 — — — —  — C. A. Crawly 2 — — — —   — N. A Calahan 2 — — — —  — James Malery 2 — — — —  The four last had each 14 Nos. Therefore they have  had two Nos each over one year. consequently they  are some what in debted to the office. I would inform  you that we are very sory that any Nos. should mis-  carry for we print just such a quantity and to  supply odd numbers breaks a whole volume therefore  we loose much in consequence of the negligence or  wickedness of Postmasters. You see in what situatin  it places us, but we have one or two consolotions,  that is we have a clear conscience before the Lord and  the wicked must not think to hide their wickedness  before the Lord. I must Close by saying I am  your brother in the bonds of the New Co[v]nant.    Wilford Woodruff. John Whitmer

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.    Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-  cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, Sidney  Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely to  them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business  now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smi◊th Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.  You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in  Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that  you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the  afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved  Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.    In the past  summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm  Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of  meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,  we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these  however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving  Kirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^  ^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph  and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement  was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram  Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and  President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm  Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their  absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, Luke  Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather in  for the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and  his company returned on or about the 10th of December;  soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,  renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,  themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church  of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br  Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from  Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking  upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the  Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,  was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,  it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which  saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, and  the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to  the people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saints  here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the  above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet  future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.    We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most◊ [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^  have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.  I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move-  ment of things here, as they are and have been.    You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with  Elder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, in  the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and  result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor  bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the  Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred  and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & John  Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead  of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding  Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally  did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop  or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-  ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With  Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,  but because they selected the place of the City Far West  and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be  built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and  ordained a committee to build the same, without  asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,  High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-  stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-  ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of  God.    These two presidents also managed to get the town plott  into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails  ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with  many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of  April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop  and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.  Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they  adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the 
 5th, and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanim-  ously agreed upon, that the town pPlatt, with 4 ^four^ eighties adjacent  to the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his council  the High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles.  During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and they  to all appearance willingly suffered themselves to be corrected by the Council.    In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolved  to to have the above m^n^amed property transfered into the hands of  the bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding Zion money, and   that the avails, of said land, should be thareafter applied to the benefit  of the poor, and other public purposes. The business of the transfer  of said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his coun-  cil, and by some meanes they managed to bind the bishop in a heavy  mortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^Which they had subscribed^ to  the building of the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erect[e]d;  Since that time, the affair of building the house has falen through.  Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscr[i]ption to  it, and these two men, claining this two thousand dollars as their  subscription, chuse to withdraw it, and put it into their own pockets.  aA small part of which has been already paid to Wm W. Phelps.    The Council, not feeling ^willing^ that the Church should be defrauded  of two thousand dollars of her public funds, and also know^ing^ that  the Church in general as well as themselves, had become dissattisfied  with their conduct as Christians, in many things, appointed a  committee to labour with them: after which, they called the whole  church in Zion togeather, who almost unanimously voted them  out of their presidenceal office.    Not long after this, the Council  saw cause to appoint a seecond committee, to wait on these men  who still presisted in their opposition to the interests a [page torn]  the Church. aAfter which, charges were prefered against them  before the Council, which were substantiated, and they were  excommunicated. Also, the Church has had much sorrow durring  the past winter, on account of the unfaithfulness of O. Cowdry,  David Whitmer, and Lyman Johnson, and in consequence of this, and  Their opposition to our beloved Brother Joseph Smith Jr, and  the best interests of the Church of Jesus Christ, ^[On]^ for presisting in  the same, a number of Charges have been substantiated against  them, before the Councils & bishop of the Church, and they have   also been excluded from fellowship. "How has the gold become dim  the most fine gold changed"!!! But I mus[t] drop this subject for want of  room. Suffice ^it^ to say Brethern, J. Smith Jr & S. Rigdon are now  with us, the Church now flourishes, and the Saints rejoice,  and the ^internal^ enemies of the Church are down. You will see by the above  prospectes, that your anxious desires for the Journal are about to be granted.    May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, bless you, and keep you unto  his coming and Kingdom, Amen! My love to all the Saints in those  regeons.    Yours in the Love of God.    Thomas B.

 [sideways text] P. S. Since Br Joseph Came to this place, we have been favored with a lengthy  revelation, in which many important items are shown forth! First. that the   Church, shall hereafter be Called "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints" Seceond it saith ^says^ "Let the City Farwest be a holy and a  consecrated land unto me, and it shall be called most holy, for the ground  upon which thou standest is holy: Tharefore, I com[mand] you to build an house  unto me, for the geathering togeather of my Saints, that they may worship me". [&c]  It also teaches, that the foundation or corner stone must be laid on the 4th  of July nex[t], and that a commencement must be made in this following season,  and in one year from the 26th of April last, the foundation must be  again commenced, and from that time, to continue the worke untile  it is finished. Thus we see that the Lord is more wise than men, for  Phelps & Whitmer thought to commence it long before this, but it was  not the Lords time, tharefore, he overthrew it. and has appointed his  own time. The plan is yet to be shown to the first presidency, and all the  saints, in all the world, are commanded to assist in building the house    Thomas B. Marsh.    Mr Wilford Woodruff  Vinalhaven.

 Hill farm, Frooms Hill Ledbury. Herefordshire, March 25th 1840    Elder W. Richards    Dear Brother. May grace, preace, strength, faith & victory, rest upon you & Sister Richards  from God our father & our Lord Jesus Christ. Dear Brother ^it^ is amid peculiar feelings that I take up  my pen to address you this morning. I have so many things in my mind at this time that  I wish to communicat & so little time & room to do it in that I hardly know whare to  begin or how to End. I feel that there never was a store House ten story high filled from top  to bottom with Merchantdize that cant have more of a variety in it than I have in my mind  at this time. & I hardly know how to go to work to give you a description of my situation  but I will try to do it by parible. figure, similee or sumthing or other. I am far from  feeling vain vane or like trifling lent I take the Liberty of making expressions to you that I  would not to the world, that you may ketch my view of the situation of things here. In the first  place permit me to say that I never before witnessed such a scenery as I am Experiencing here  neither did I every expect to in my generatoion. The Lord of Hosts is with me in power & sone  some of the time the Devil to. I have had some mighty Battles with the devil sword in hand since  I have been here & God has enabled me to give him a deadly wound & routed him out   of his camp & he has fled from me wounded & roaring like a Lion [&] I can hear  the sound of his roar about 10 miles off & I expect him to return for an other Battle  by & by for you are aware thant an Enemies camp cannot be brock up without some  noise & so you can form sumthing of an Idea of it from the following description.  I have been here 21 days preached 20 times & Baptized Mr Thomas Kington the superintendant of the  preachers of the United Brethren, a branch of or broke off from the Methodist Church & with Mr Kington I Baptzed  23 preachers of the same Order that was under his superintendance & also I Baptzed 46 of the members  of the same church making 70 in all, this scenery has committed into my hands & charge  & my controll mostly 45 esstablished places of preaching most of which are licensed according to  Law, & also 48 Preachers 24 of which I have already Baptzed & most of the rest are ready as soon  as they can have an opportunity. as I said before I say a gain their will be a mighty harvest  here for all the churches which these preachers are over are ready to receve the word. should I judge  from outward appearances I should think their would spedily be 500 Baptzed in this region &  probably more still I dont wish to count chickens before they are hatched. I am now Baptzing  about 10 daiy daily day before yesterday 12 & yesterday 9 sone days I have to go in the water 3  time a day. I Baptzed 6 preachers yesterday & I have a number to Baptze to day. yesterday 3  preachers came in a charriot or Gig to visit me they never had herd me preach at all. I had on wet  cloths & going to the pool to Baptze. I testified of Jesus Christ unto them the power of God rested upon  us & they kneeled down & wept & prayed, & their Gig stood still & they all went down into the pool  the same hour & I Baptzed them & they went their way rejoiceing & praising God. Mr Kington is an  humble man I have Ordained him an Elder & I ordained two priest their will be many worth[y]  labourers raised up in this country. you see by this time Brother Richards I am not Idle but  have much to do & need much wisdom from God to do it well, for it is the strongest  fishing ever I have done & I domt expect any thing els but while gathering the Salmon I shall get  among them some ells & snakes for their has already been sone after they would were Baptzed that would  pitch & Bound like a porpose or jump & roll like a hen with their head cut off manifesting ev[er]y kind of  spirit but that of order & if ever an Elder had any triming to do I expect to have my share of it  by & by for in doing such a rapid work as this I have to become all things to all men for I  cannot get time to do much triming as yet. in fact some have before I was aware of it 
 bounded into the water to me stark naked excecpting a loose cloth around their legs but I put a  stop to all disorder as fast as possible. & again I am Having a mighty struggle against this [Methodist]  power of falling down like a dead man stiff as a stake which is in some of the preachers as well  as the people. I have to handle all these things in wisdom. among the number that I have &  are Baptzing are some large farmers having 3 or 400 acres of land I have Baptzed sone constables  as well as preachers. there is a Merchent in Hanly that we Baptzed that trade is so bad that he is wind  ing up business & wants to go to Zion with the Saints. I have Baptzed most of his relatives  here several Brothers & Sisters here he has come down to visit them he has said sumthing to  them about it. & they all want to [trans] up business here & move with the Saints in  the U.S.A. & in fact most all the Saints are getting the same spirit here without my  preaching it. I do wish the Twelve would spedily come to England that we might hold a council  somewhare about these & many other things. when you next write to me say a word to me  what your mind is about this. the farmers here feel like this that bad times are coming & the  sooner they can turn their property in to gold the better & in fact with the view I have of the   times I cannot advise them as yet to the contrarary. you begin to see Brother Richards that I must  have much to occupy my mind at preasent considering what I have to do. & in addition to  this I have just recceved a Litter from Elder cCordon at Burslem. Stating that Elder Turley is   taken with a States warrent & put into Stofford Gail, it was done by a man in Birmingham  for an old Debt that Brother Turley contracted 15 years ago before he left England, or in other words  Turley was in partnership with a man & when they dissolved Turley gave up the stock into his  hands to seell & he supposed it was all settled but now the man claims that he did not  sell the stock for as much as he expeted & that he has still claims On Turley. John Jones  in Burslem was connected in taking him It is merely a trick of the Devil to stop his  preaching but I believe the Lord will overturn it for Gdod how long he will be confined  in prison I do not know. The whole Labour at the Potteries is now flung upon Elder Cordon  & when he wrote me he was some out of health & should their be any faithful labourer at  liberty would they not do well to go into that part of the vineyard & assist. And again in addition  to this case I have a certain Brother Richards whome I love of a truth for the truths sake that dwelleth  in him & I pray God that it may be with him forever & he asks an interest in my prayerrs in   his behalf & his companions that the Lord may manifest his will concerning them. I will now  say Dear Brother I will gladly comply with your request the first leasure moments I can  get, in fact I have attempted two or three times since I recceved your two Letters upon the subjet  to lay the case before the Lord but no sooner than I would begin to pray some one would bye  wraping at my door for me to go & baptzed them or for sumething els. in fact since I recceved  your letters I have had no spare time hardly to pray for any thing, for you see how things are   with me & of course can judge how my time is taken up. I scarcely pass a pool of water but  what sumbody is waiting there for me to baptze them. & in fact if John had more Baptizing to  do when all Judea & Jerrusalem went unto him to be Baptzed, then I have had for a few days past he  certainly had his hands full. But do not think dear Brother that I shall close this letter with out  answering the questions you have asked me & expressing my feelings unto you No God forbid   not with standing I have not had time to lay your case before the Lord as I could wish, yet I have a word  to express upon the subject. In the first place I wish to say I recceved your twoo letters & have read them over  several times. & you speak my mind perfectly with regard to any other persons opening any of our letters  excepting our own Qurorum. & when I gave permision for a letter to be opened should one come before  my returned, I did not then expet to be gone but vary few days before my return & it was   under the impression that if I had a letter at all during my absence it would be from Brother  Clayton in Manchester, & as they wanted to hear from him I gave them that priv^i^lege with a charge  to say nothing concerning the contents if their was any thing that the church should not know 
 but being gone longer than I expected your letter arived & was opened by Brother Turley. But I  have sent orders for no more letters to be opened that are sent to me. And with regard to the  question you asked me on the scrap of paper. (I say yes let them eat or drink what they will in such cases)  I should be pleased Brother Richards to hear from you often & give me all the news you have  from any quarter I was pleased to hear of doors being opened in Scotland tell me whare  I can direct a letter to Elder Mullenner in Scotland. also inform me of any information  you get from any of the Twelve I wonder why they tarry so long in Americ[a] may the Lord  hasten them to his country. Also inform me concerning sister Richards health from time  to time give my love to her & tell her I should be exceding glad to see her but when I shall  get out of this part of the vineyard I cannot tell. pray for me Brother Richards that I may be meek  & humble that I may fully overcome evry speces of pride & self wrighteousness [that] I may feel  my dependence on God in all things, & that I may know the mind of God concerning me in all  things. A word concerning you & Sister Richards. But what am I that I should teach or instruct  thee or inquire the will of the Lord concerning thee. O that I was more worthy that I might greant  thee the desire of thy heart in this this thing & that I might more fully know the mind of   God concerning myself & all things that are required at my hand that I might be more fully  prepared to greant thee thy request. But if you can receive it at my hands I say unto you thus   saith the Lord let not my servant Willard Richards litely essteem his calling or station for I have  called him & he is a chosen vessel unto me & no man shall ever do his work or take his  crown. for he is humble & seeks my will, his afflictions shall work together for his good in  the end, let him be not weary in commtting his case unto the Lord or trusting in my n[a]me  & I will bring it to pass & the darkness shall pass away & the light shall come. & I [page torn]  break the bands that bind him & lib[er]ate him from those under his charge for they [page torn]  not worthy & some are under condemnation for litely essteeming the priesthoo[d] [illegible]  whome God has set over them. Let him still call upon me in Mighty prayer & be not weary  committing his companions & all his ways into my hands & I will work out his deliverance  in a way that I have prepared, & he shall yet have many souls as seals of his ministry, & be  mighty in council, & much beloved by his brethren the Twelve. Thus Dear Brother is  the voice of the spirit concerning you & I would say to Sister Richards by way of council to try  not to be discouraged nor desire to die but to live. though your afflictions may be  great for a time yet consider what Jesus has bourn, commit all your ^ways^ unto the Lord  you will ere long enter that rest that remains for the people of God then your  morning will be turned into joy & you will be satisfyed with the goodness of   the Lord I feel as though the Lord will open a door whareby you will be liberated  before many days I will pray for you before God that your faith fail not & that  you may have grace & strength according to your day. whatever is manife[s]ted  unto me I will endeavour to communicate it unto you from tine to  time. Write me soon Brother Richards & dont be discouraged God will be your  friend. I should be glad to see the second No of the Tines & Seasons should you  get one please send ^it^ to me at Ledbury. Any thing you may have upon your  mind pleas communicate freely It will meet a welcome reception    W Woodruff    Excuse my scribling I dont have time to write plain [w]ay

 Ledbury He[refordshir]e March 31 st 1840    Dr Brothr Richards    I received your letters last evening also one from Elder Cordon  I have but about 10 minutes to write to you at this time, & while writing to   you at this time I have several conversing to me so I have to write & answer  questions at the same time, so if I make a blunder excuse it. Dear Brothr  I have much I want to say to you. I have just written to Elder Turley &  enquired all about his circumstances & expet he will answer me immediately  & we must do what we can for him both by faith & works. It is   begining to become the day of Gods power here in some degree. & I   hardly know what make of it all. for some cause no man dare meet  me in publick or come nijh [nigh] me at all to oppose me I have not had the  first word of opposition in publick, but yet the whole world is stired up here  all the Church Ministers are holding conventions here & they find they cannot  stop me or the work by law & they are afraid of looseing their member &  they have come to the conclusion to sink pools & baptized their churches by  immersion as the ownly way to save them. they sent to one of their constables  to take me up but they sent to the wrong man for before the message came  to him I had Baptized him. one of the clerks of the church is intending to be  Baptized but I have not yet given him an opportunity. my labours have   mostly been at Frooms Hill 5 miles from Ledbury I never preached in   Ledbury untill last evening, & notwithstanding I did not know a soul that  lived in town, yet a large number flocked around me in the streets as   soon as it was known that I was in town & gave me a hearty shake of   the hand & the Baptist minister came to me rejoiced at an [interview] flung open his   large chapel for me to preach in went with me into the pulpit & prayed mighlyly for  God to bless me & I preached to the largest congra◊gation ever met in the house   the Minister & rest m[e]mbers in town are Belveing. I have about a dozen to  Baptize to day on Sunday I Baptized 13 confirmed 35 & B & C 9 yesterday I Broke Bred on Sunday  to 100 saints. Elder Richards one word more to you & I must close this sheet. I want you   to come immediatey & be a coworker with me in the vineyard here I cannot do   the work alone I am called to Baptize 4 or 5 times a day I want no better man than   yourself to council & labour with me here & help me reep this mighty harvest if you   have nothing on but rags come I want your person come & God shall bless you with   health & strength come by way of Manchester Burslem & get what you can for Br Turley  & call & see him at Stofford goal. from Wolverhampton come to Worcester then enquire  fromr  Froome's Hill. & Hill farm. I want an interview with you as soon as you come  before you meet much with the churches. If you can leave Sister R with any frie[n]ds  a little while so do, dont fail of comeing Dear Brother if possible  whether you come or not write immedtialy    W Woodruff

 [page torn] [hole burned in paper] Glostershire April 3rd 1840    Elder W. Richards    Dear Brother    I supposed you noticed that I did not answer  any of your qustion in my last letter which you asked in March 27th the truth is I  did not have time ownly to glance it over hastily & hurry since looked it over care  fully I thought I would sit down & write a few lines more to you. I remarked  to you in the last that I wished. you to come soon & labour with me awhile I did not  as fully give my reason for the remark as I ought & should have done if I had room. But I  would here remark that I did not make the request thinking that I had any power, desire, or  wish to controll you. But Becaus it was the desire of my heart, & feeling that I need  council & assistance for much depends upon the manner the field is governed here  I want to hold several councils or conferences in this region & ordain officers in  the different Branches Besides their will be many to confirm. I have confirmed about  100 & their will soon be another hundred to confirmed & I have just as much  as I can do to preach & to Baptze daily without confirming. theirfore I stand much  in need of some assistance & council in such a field. I have Baptzed about 40 preachers  of the Unted Brethren primitive Methidist. [&] it has flung into my hands about 50 esstablished  places of preaching which are licensed including one or two chapels. & you can see at once  Elder Richards that it am overwhelming labour to be upon one man. & he needs his spirit  sanctified & his Body Immortal to stand such a labour & it has put me at times to my  wits ends to know what to do with so many places of preachings & preachers, But according to the Best  wisdom I could get I could have pursued the following course I have finally told the preahers  to continue to fill their appointments & teach righteousness & try to prepare the minds  of the people for the fulness of the gospel, but not to administer in any of the ordinances of the  gospel untill I can have some help & set in order the churches & ordain such persons  as God shall call. the reason I have done this is the as soon as the preachers disappoint the   meeting & congregation those houses of worship will be shut up & sants might be shut out  of the Kingdom that otherwise might come [in] tell me what your feelings are about such  a course. I am well aware Brother Richards their is much to do in many places But  it does appear to me that their is no field at present in England, whare your labour &  council is more needed or would be of more benefit than to join me in this field a  season. I have no controll at oll over you in this matter. But should consider it a great  privilege & favor to labour together awhile you with you. If you can set in order  your house & leave Sister Richards a season with some friends or friend, I think you  would enjoy Bettr health here as it is entirey a farming country. Should you come will  you please remember to Bring me the first No of times & Seasons & the Book of written Rev  that I left with you & if you come by the way of the Potteries will you call upon Brother Wm  Hulme in Stoke & ask him to send to me that Little china Box a present from Brother Rowley. I have written  to Brothr Turley but had no answer as yet. if either preston, Manchester, or the potteries churches  felt to do any thing for him as you come along you could conveigh it to tim in Stafford as  you pass though. If you can any way come soon I should be glad to see you I wonder  why the Twelve do not come from America. I feel as though word ought to be soon sent  for 20 or 30 or a whole quorum of the Seventies for I dont see when their will be a Better  opportunity to prune England than the present. I Baptzed 13 the day that I wrote your letter 9 yesterday &  many tomorrow & Sunday (Write after [1] pence a letter) If the Moon family gets ready would it not be well  to give them a Recommendation & let them go. did the three families go from preston. should you  be in Ledbury alone their is a lane neary opposite the Market house walk down that street by a tan yard 100  yards & enquire for Francis Pullen his wife is a Member. I am sorry about Brothr Mullener I wondr  what is the Matter of him whether he is under any transgressing or whether it is the devil desireing to destroy  his usefullness I am inclined to believe the Latter let us pray for him that he may be supported untill  some Elders come [that] one go to his assistance I think of writing him a letter to day as I have not yet  I am now leaving all confirming for another time & shall appont meetings for [that] purpose &  I pray God that you may be with me to assist me in it. It is strange that none of us hear from   America I have not herd from my family for about 6 months. It seems that Abisah & Abiram in  Preston begins to think that Moses takes to much upon himself but they must be careful that they dont  burn their fingers give my Best Respects to Sistr Richards let not her courage fail, [Rememebrre]  me to all Saints    I am ever yours in the Love of God    W Woodruff

 Dymock June 3rd,1840    Dear Bro Brigham,    I sent you a line yesterday; but there were a  few itims that escaped my notice, Capt Bogart (Bogart) of  mob memory, has killed a man—ran away & 500$ is offered for him -   [Oho] - it is reported in the papers, says, 'Bro Holman, that the Indians are  ma[ke]ing sod house among the corn&horses of upper Missourie  & the inhabitants are much afraid & that the Indians are  making preparations for war to go against them &    "O, their end their dreadful end."    Gen 10 chap 9th verse    well among other things I was thinking of a bit of  an out & asked Bro Kington for 50 Stars to  take along with me—he examined and found he   could not spare one more than 40 Nos. Now if  Bro Pratt has any Millenial Stars on hand, I wish he  would send us 250 as quick as possible and if he  has not any ^that^ he would print some without delay—& I would  recommend, with the approbati[o]n of Bro Woodruff, that 100 copies  of each No be carefuly laid aside for the benefit of the Quorum [at]  the end of the release. There are regular carriers passing  Bro Kingtons weekly—from manchester, if you could find their office  I think you might send the papers cheaper - by them. please [d]o let  us know when the next paper is going to press.  I do hope some means will be devised to offod these paper for 6 pence [Yours] &. Willa[r]d Richa[r]ds    W. Woodruff

 No 40 North Richmond St. Edinh    Oct. 29th 40    Dear Brethren Woodruff & Smith    Yours of this  week came to hand this morning I was highly  pleased with the news with the exception  of the loss which Elder Woodruff has sustained  with him I feel to mourn for it brought forcibly  to my mind the death of my little daughter Lydia  Sister Woodruff must feel disconsolate I cannot but  sympathise with her as she is now left entirely  alone. It is cheering to hear of the prosperity of   Nauvoo. It forcibly reminds me of the vision of  Esdras in which he suddenly saw a woman in great  trouble weeping with great lamentation but sud-  denly there appe^a^red in her stead a great city. It will  not take the Jews long to build Jerusalem at that  rate. I think that the sin of laziness & indolence  will not be imputed to the saints much longer  for they seem to build cities with almost as much dex-  terity as children build cob houses & I presume they are 
 far better. the South west of Iowa is a handy  place place for the fur company & those who deal  in bear skins & sweet oil. I think the ravens  will get fat & turkey buzzards have a sociable  feast before many thousand moons wax new & old.  Success to the emigrants & to the south west ex-  ploring company. It is to be hoped that they their  expeditions will result in many important discoveries  in the ancient Territories. You must excuse my  fooleries for when one has not much news  he dislikes sending an empty letter. I baptized  seven last evening which makes 61 in this branch  I have received no letters from any of the brethren  since conference. Er Taylor's letters in the  "Manx Liberal" are superlative Methodist Priests   stand no chance at all. You tell me Parley  has returned I am happy ^to^ hear of it I should not  have thought however that the news would have  come by way of London. that is like the New  yorkers getting the latest news from Liverpool  via N. Orleans which actually took place last  winter. In your next you will oblige me if you  will give me the news from Glasgow & Paisley  as I feel anxious to hear from them the furthest way 
 round is ^frequently^ the quickest way of conveyance in this  day of wonders. Give my respects to Ers Taylor &  Clark & tell them that I have received the paper  they forwarded & have heard of their success by the  way of London give me all the news you get from  the Isle of man & also from Manchester give my  respects to Parley also. I am still alone Bro.  Watts has not yet arrived. please write to me  Er Taylor's address I am glad to hear that  you have succeeded in obtaining a place to  preach in if your congregation should diminish  a few weeks you need not be discouraged if [you] [page torn]  continue to hold meetings they will eventually  get on the increase again the probability is  that I shall stay in Edinburgh this winter  unless it should be thought best for me to do  otherwise I am at the disposal of the the council  May the Lord bless you & open an effect-  ual door in London is the prayer of your  fellow Labourer    O.
