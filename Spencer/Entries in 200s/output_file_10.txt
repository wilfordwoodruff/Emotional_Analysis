God alone knows how we mourn his loss, yet we know that it pleased God to take him, because the righteous purposes and work of God must roll on. The Testator has died: His testimony that the Truth is now established, and the Book of Mormon and Bible was true, was given by him on his death bed; therefore, as he has sealed his testimony with his death, it is now in full force to the condemnation or justification of the world. Upon his death bed he gave us his testimony in these words; "I know the work is set up; Truth is established; Hold fast to the Rock." By the same spirit as he gave this testimony, he bore his testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon. O brethren and sisters, we cannot describe to you in a letter, what we have seen and heard, and what the Lord has made known to us through our dear brother in his dying hours. Only those who saw and heard can fully feel and know these great things in their fullness. We can only write a part of these testimonies; and when we see you face to face, and can talk with you in  the Spirit, then we will tell you more, for we know that these things are strength and comfort to all who are in Christ Jesus our Lord.

This was something he never did before in his life. We told him we wanted him with us yet many years if it was God's will, and urged him to not think about dying. He answered that his work was done; and God's will, not his, be done: and if it pleased the Lord to let him remain some years to see the work move on, well and good; and if it pleased the Lord to take him hence, well and good. He would read the replies to his pam- phlet in the Heralds, and we would ask him if he did not want to answer answer such and such things which were in the Herald, and send the answers forth to the Latter Day Saints; so the honest in heart might not be led wrong, but know the truth. He would always tell us that the honest in heart would have their spiritual eyes opened in God's own due time, and they would then understand and receive his pam- phlet; that he had born his testimony in the pamphlet concerning all these things, and his work was done: that he would not make a single reply to the Herald, no matter what they would say; that he would not carry on a debate or disputations with them. He said, that when a servant of God had born his testimony to a people, if that people openly rejected it and desired only to refute and contend against it because of their blindness to the truth, that that servant had rid his garments of their blood, and his work was done: And for him to keep up a contention with those people, he would come under that condemnation where Christ says that ENDENTRY J.

Jack, at the President's office told me, he had been instructed to pay me $150 in cash, and the balance in tithing orders. This arrangement would be nearly satisfactory, if I am not called on the before mentioned mission, But if I am, then I feel that I must very respect- fully ask you to instruct Br. Jack to pay all the amount, or nearly all, in cash or in orders equal to cash in value.  It will take me nearly one half of the appropriated $403 to pay a little debt, contracted during very trying times in this Territory, and what little equipment I need for myself and for my wife, before I leave her, etc: And I suppose that the remaining $200 are the very least so lon a journey can be under- taken with.  In consideration of  these circumstance I would ask, if it be possible to get the $200 still due me in some other pay- ment than thil tithing orders. Of course I would not any of till the day I am going on the mission.  Please let me know about this matter, if possible, Thursday or Friday. After Friday ENDENTRY contention was of the devil, and that disputations must be done away. O brethren, what a lesson we have learned from our dear brother on this point. We now see that a true servant of God, bears his testimony to certain truths, and there he lets the matter rest, to the condemnation or justification of the hearers: but all who are not true servants will not rest but desire contention disputation and debate continually; for in this they delight, because they can display their wit and human wisdom: but the servant of God desires to please God only and not men, and is meek and lowly in heart, caring not what man will say or think. May God help us to be like our departed brother in this respect. Hear what he says in the conclusion of his pamphlet; "Brethren, I have this to say in conclusion, I will not argue and dispute with you. In the spirit of love and meekness I have told you what the Spirit of God has moved upon me to speak. I am now past 82 years of age, and my work in this world is about done. FIGURES My days to stay here are not many more; I soon go to rest with those who  have gone before me; but I have rid my garments of your blood and the blood of all men." Brethren, we have told you before about the prophecy which Bro. David. We have the old yellow time worn paper, among the sacred papers of our dear brother. This prophecy has been fulfilled. It says of Bro. David that "he shall be a ruler in Zion when he is old and  well stricken in years. He shall say to the faithful, 'Go forth, and build up the waste places of Zion.'"

And may we at all times have the spirit of love with us; not only for our brethren who love us, but for all men, even our enemies; those who hate us and persecute us, let us love them in return, and show to them by our words and actions that we do in reality love them in return. All who can not do this, have not yet been born of the Spirit, and can not see the kingdom of God. No one is yet qualified to labor in the masters vineyard, unless he can go forth in this spirit of love as described so plainly by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Above all things brethren, let us remember this. Love—it is the fulfilling of the whole law. It, and it alone is the key by which we can unlock the gates of heaven, and enter therein when we shall have done with this life. Happy is he who posesses it continually. Having it only at times will not ^suffice.^ do The wicked have it at times. We must be of this spirit continually, if we expect to inherit the first resurection. Our dear brother David was of this spirit continually. May we grow in grace until we have reached this mark.  Not long after Bro. David had selected his funeral text, he was taken to his bed. During his feeble condition, Bro. E L Kelly of the Reorganized church came here to see him. This was last spring. He told Bro. Kelly that he had selected his funeral text, and that his work was done; that he did not expect to remain here very much longer. He had Bro. Kelly read this text, which was Rev. 22:14.
