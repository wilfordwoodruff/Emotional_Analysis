 time I had ever seen him  we appointed a meeting for him to speak to ourlittle branch, ^He instructed [illegible] us the branch^ and we had a precious time, he spoke till near midnight. He was uponan important mission in connexion with Lyman Wight, it was to gather up from100 to 5000 men ^a company^ to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied Brother Pratt to Jefferson County, I told him my circumstances. He said it was my duty to try to prepare myself to go to Kirtland & join the Camp of Zion. According to his council I went to withall my might & settelled all my accounts ^business^ & business and on the 11 day of April1834 I bid my friends farewell, & took a pair of horses & waggon & took withme Brothers Harry Brown & Warren Ingles, & started for Kirtland Ohio.I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch, and other Elders on the way & arrived in Kirtland on the 25th of April 1834, where I f was introduced to the prophet Josephthe first time I had ever seen him. He invited me to make his house my homewhich kind offer I excepted of & staid with him about one week. I have forthe first time became acquainted not ownly with the Prophet Joseph & his family butwith many of the High Priests, Elders & Saints which I had never before seenI spent one Sabbath in Kirtland & heard many of the ^leading^ Elders speak & I felt to rejoice before God for the light & knowledge which was manifest to me during that daythrough the preaching of the Elders of Israel. According to appointment I left Kirtlandupon the 1st day of May with a part of the company went to New Portagewhere we remained untill all the company came up joined us, from Kirtland & wewere organized.  Then on the 7th day of May we took up our march like the Childrenof Israel pitching our tents by the way, & travelled to Missouri according tothe account already spoken of in the Church History, which was called ^the Camp of^ ZionsCamp which went up to redeem Zion & assist those persecuted brethren.Our whole journey, manner of travelling, incidents upon the way, the way the Lord fought our battles with hail & storm, at Crooked River, the visitation of the cholera toour camp, the death & burial of the Saints &c has all been published in the ChurchHistory. we arrived After we had pitched our tents in Clay County Missouri^our numbers being 205^ & many of the Brethren had been taken sick & some had died Joseph requested the camp to dispersed except enough to take care of the sick all who had teams were required to leave the ground & go among the brethren I went to Brother Lyman Wights in company with Heman Hyde & Milton Holmes. After a few daysJoseph called the ^Brethren^ people to gather at Lyman Wights and told the people ^them^ if they would humble themselves before the Lord & covenant to keep His commandments & obey his council the plague should be stayed from that hour, & their should not be another 
 case of cholera in the camp. The people ^brethren^ covenanted to do this & the plague was stayed & there was not another case in camp. Joseph held several meetingswith the ^Saints^ Saint Set them in order, & ^President Joseph Smith^ returned home with many other of the brethrenI remained with Lyman Wight laboring with my hands till the following winter. * ^(*see paper apart & page 9th)^At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights in Clay County MissouriI was ordained to the office of a Priest * ^* By the direction of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter on the 5 day of Nov 1834^ in I had a great desire in myheart to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to my fellow men for I saw suchblessings, beauty & glory in it that I had a great desire to assist my brethrenin proclaiming it to the inhabitants of the Earth t and this desire continuedto increase upon me, but I did not reveal my feelings to any man, but soon^(the above lines are in paper apart {[shorthand?]} 32)^after I was ordained to the office of a priest I received an ^appointment^ mission by BishopEdward Partridge to go in connexion with Elder Harry Brown on a missionthrough the Southern part of Missouri & through the Arkansas, into the SouthernStates Agreeable to ^my^ this appointment I bid my brethren farewell in ClayCounty & on the 13th day of January 1835 I took my valise in hand weighing15 lbs mostly Books of Mormon & started in company with Elder Harry ^Brown^ withoutwithout purse or scrip & crossed the ferry ^river^ into Jackson County, * ^* as we stepped onto the bank two horsmen le^a^d there horses onto the bank they eyed us very closely but said^ ^nothing to us^ we stopped southopen our mission This was the first & last time that we ever trod the soil ofJackson County, we felt thankful for the privilege & we bowed our knees beforethe Lord & offered up the gratitude of our hearts unto our Father in heaven forthe privilege & prayed for his protection whi from the mob while going throughthe county as the Saints had just been driven out and ^as^ a Latter Day Saint perriledhis life to found in the county, we prayed that the judgments of God mightrest upon the wicked who had shed the blood of the Saints in that land that theirblood might be avenged & that the land might be cleansed from sin wicked-ness & abominations & redeemed that the Saints might again inherit itwe arose & went on our way rejoiceing. I had in my possessiona petition to the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us in Jackson County for the purpose of obtaining signat[ure] unto it we bent our way south through Jackson County without any harm yet in one instance we were miraculously preserved from a large mob ^of about 60^ assembled at a grog shop which we had to pass. On the 18th Jan we called at the Harmony Mission had an interview with the president of the mission a Presbyterian minister, it was near sun downhe would neither give us any thing to eat nor keep us because we were mormonsit was 15 miles to the nearest house which was an ^Jerrews^ Indian traiding house kept 
 kept by a Mr Jerrew, we asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directi^directions^ the Spirit said to me that he was decieving us, directeing us wrong, I asked the question3 times over & he declaired he was telling us the truth we followed his direction& it led us into the Osage River swamp where we were lost in the darkness of the night ^we undertook to follow the river but it being about the crookedest one in earth America we made but slow progress^ ^and^ after travelling through mud & water for one hour we concluded to go out onto the open prairie & lide lie down in the grass untill morning but when we got out into the prairie we h[e]ard the Osage Indians drum & shout at the trading houseas they were having a powwow we followed by the sound, & went intotheir midst * ^*as we approached we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs they smelt of us in a friendly manner^ ^but did not try to bite nor bark we arrived about midnight, covered with mud hungry and weary^ we were kindly received by Mr Jerrew fed & lodged for the night19th Mr Jerrew gave us a good breakfast set us across the Osage River^(see paper apart 2nd page 10)^in a canoe & was started upon our long days walk it being 60 miles to the nearest house in the direction we were going ^and we had not a morsel of anything with us to eat^ Most of our travels through the day wasthrough prairie before dark we entered timber timber land as we were approachingthe timber a large black bear came out of the timber & met us we had no weapons but a small pistol but as the bear got within about 6 rods of us herose upon his hind feet & examined us a short time & turned & went offanother course we travelled on as fast as we could we were soon invelloped in so thick darkness it was with great difficulty that we could keep the road we weresoon surrounded with a large drove of wolves who ^that^ kept up a continual howling& would freequently rush upon us & come up within a few feet of us we travelledabout one two hours in this situation feeling that we were in danger we concluded to stop & build a fire & wait till morning. Accordingly we built a large fire which drove the wolves of & as we were about to lie down we h[e]ard a dog bark & also a bell, we found we were near a house we took each of us a brand of fire & in going about one quarter of a mile we found a ^log hut about 12 feet square^ house occupied by one Mr. Williams who was in Jackson County during the mobing of the Saints, & he had lately moved to this place depending upon his gun mostly for his living it being 60 miles to a house on the north of him, & 12 miles on the southHe and his family was living in a small old log house ^hut^ about 12 feet square & one bed in the room upon which lay his wife several children & 3 young dogs. He lay stretched out upon the ^bare^ floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to the house but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way, it was past 11 oclock at night I turned away the quilt looked into the house every thing was in sound sleepI spoke 3 times no one stired not even a dog, I walked in & laid my hand upon the mans shoulder the mo & spoke to him the moment he felt the wait of my hand he leaped to his feet & commenced running around the room leaping as high 
 as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened as we were travellers & friends & did not wish to hurt him but wished to stop with him himover night, when he came to his senses we as he gave us permission to stop with him till morning if we would take the bare floor as he did thenwe excepted, we asked for something to eat as we had walked 60 miles with[out] eating a morsel of food. He said he had nothing for us said that hed had got to kill game for his breakfast in the morning. He said the cause of his fright was hehe had shot a large panther dead a few nights before standing in his door, & he thought his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the bear floor & we were  glad of this place as it soon began to rain & rained hard through the nightwe arose in the morning & went on in the rain 12 miles to a Mr Connerswho was also in the Jackson County mob who gave us a breakfast but damned us while we were eating because we were mormons & when we had finished a hearty breakfast we thanked him very politely for it and went our way and left him swareing ^We did feel thankful for it for we had walked 72 miles without any thing food but very little^^see page apart 2 page 11^We continued travelling preaching by the way without stoping ownly over night, ^or on the^ ^Sabbath^ untillwe got to Petty John Creek in the Arkansas Territory. Here Mr Allexander Akeman resided with a large family of sons & one daughter all of which we settelled around him Mr Akeman was a member of the Church in Jackson County & a part of his family, his wife died strong in the faith in Missouri,his whole family was mobed some of his sons were whiped severly. But he could not stand the persecution & the loss of his property. He moved to Arkansasto get rid of mormonism had apostitised & was bitter against the work, when we called upon him he opposed us strongly, spoke against the leaders of the Church & the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us & had a little faith I had a dream the night before I went there what we should meet with& what would transpire. ^relate the dream^ When we met with opposition not ownly by Mr Akemanbut from many in the neighborhood Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately& continue his journey I told him I should stay & see my dream fulfilledwe staid in the neighborhood 25 days during which time the Lord brought judgmentupon those who had threatened to mob us & take our lives many of them died suddenlywhile we were there and I was warned three times of the Lord to go with MrAkeman & bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism & the wickednessof his course in opposing it & the last time I called upon ^him^ he was filled with wrath against me & when I left his house he followed me in a rage apparently with some evil intent when a few rod I had got a few rods from his door he was nearly treading upon my heels he fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thunder bolt ^lightning^. He immediately began to swell & turned black 
 this created a great wailing & mourning with his famil, Brother Brown & myself assisted the family in laying him out & burying him. He died on the 14th day of Feb 1835 & we buried him on the 16. This clo singulardispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people & they began to reflect &wished to hear preaching, we held several meetings & preached to the people webaptized a Mr Hubbel & his wife aged people who had opened their doors & given us a home & just as we had got the people prepared to receive the Gospel & anxious to learn & pleading with us to stay & preach, Brother Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south. I was fully satisfied that should we stop we should build up a Church, & I was convinced it was our duty to stop but Brother Brown held the office of an Elder I a priest& we were travelling together upon a mission, & I felt that I must subjectto those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.  This is an error which many have committed in this Church who were sent as missionaries to theworld, as soon as they get doors open & a people prepared to receive the gospelthey go away & leave them we left this people with tears in their eyes we left& Brother Brown did not baptize another person during his whole southernmission we left them on the 2nd day of March went upon the bank of the Arkansas River cut down a large cotton wood tree dug out a canoe 4 feet wide 12 feet long put on a pair of oars & rowed down the Arkansas River 125 miles to Little Rock geting ^beging^ our food by the way a meal at a timeas we had an opportunity, after visiting Little Rock we tied up our canoe ^travelled down the river 10 miles^ on below Little Rock & tied up our canoe on the East Bank & stoped with a Mr Jonespreached next day at his house on the 16 left our canoe with Mr Jones walked back ^the East Bank of the Arkansas River & started on foot to ward & wade the Mississippi^^Swamp to Memphis Tennessee we travelled on the old military road it was over 200miles the way we travelled ^up the river 10 miles took the old^ ^the road^ & almost the whole distance was knee deep in mud &water up the river 10 miles opposite Little Rock & took the old military road & started to waid the missippi swamp which was mostly covered with water from Little Rock Arkansas to Memphis Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles, we waided through mud & water knee deep day after day & in some instances40 miles per day before we could get a stoping place. On the 24th while in the swamp I had an attack of the rheumatism & could not travel but slowMy companion Brother Brown had got in a hurry & wished to hasten to the Missippi River take boat close up his mission, take boat & returnto his family in Kirtland, & as I could not travel as fast as he wished so we parted to meet no more for about 3 years he left me siting on a log in the mud & water I being lame & unable to walk & no food & 12 miles to the 
 nearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste I then knelt down in the water & prayed the Lord to heal me up & the spirit of the Lord rested upon me & I was healed the pain left me I arose & went my way ^*^ whenever I met with one or more families I preached to them & bore my testimony as I went alone to the people I arrived at the Missippi River& crossed it in the evening of the 27th March 1835 [FIGURE](*^after^ that night that ^after^ Brother Brown left me in trying to travel in the night to me he losthis ^way^ got into a thicket of brambles & tore nearly all of his cloths off from himHe stoped at a cabin & took him nearly all night to mend up his clothes)[FIGURE] I stoped for the night at a publick house kept by Mr Josiah Jackson I was [illegible]up for ^of being^ an imposture Mr Jackson believed I was one of Murrells clan ^instead of a Mormon preacher^ who wasthen murdering & stealing Negroes through the country & to test the thing he gathered to gether a large house full of the the wickedest & most corrupt J Gentry in the city& set me to preaching, to them, to test whether I could preach or not. I do notthink that Mr Jackson or the same company of men & women will ever meet to gether again for the same purpose to test whether a Mormon Elder could preach ornot for they would not like again to have their sins & abominations revealed to each other as plainly & pointedly as I told them that night through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they seemed glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms,I travelled from Memphis to Middle Tennessee. And on the 4th of AprilI met with Elder Warren Parish at Father Frys in Benton County ^Middle^ TennesseeHe & David Patten had been labouring to gether through the winter in Tennessee they had baptized some 20 or 30 persons Elder Patten had returned to Kirtland at that timebefore I arrived. I joined Elder Parrish & we laboured to gether ^over 3 months^ and continued*^and travelled & preached daily baptizing such as would receive our testimony on the 23rd of June^^we received a letter from Oliver Cowdery saying that they wished ^Elder^ Parrish to come to Kirtland & for me to remain^^to take charge of the Southern Churches & the Lord would bless me in so doing^to extend our labourse through Tennessee & Kentucky, Elder Warren Parrish ordainedme to the office of an Elder. On the 28th day of June at Father Frys EagleCreek Benton County Tennessee  we baptized some 40 persons while labouring to gether& on the 23rd of July ^1835^ I parted with Elder Parish also returned to KirtlandThis left me alone in my labours in the South. I continued to travel alonethrough the year & extended my labours both in Kentucky & Tennessee I baptized 43 persons during this season 31 after Brother Parrish left meOn the 15 day of Nov while traveling about 12 miles in the night with severallof the Brethren among whom was Brother Benjamin Clapp, a tremendous storm of wind & rain over took us it was exceeding dark we bacame lost in a forest & wecrossed a dangerous stream some 20 times we had a creek to cross, the rain^stream^ had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without 
 swimming our horses & several of the company were females & could not consistentlycross the stream he and we undertook to head the stream so that we could crosssufficient to ford it, but in in the attemp in the midst of the darkness of the night& the raging of the wind & rain we became lost in the thick woods we had neither fire,light, or road, but was in the darkness, rain, wind, mud, creeks, & treetops we crossed the stream near twenty times & setting aside our females & horses we made more the appearanceof fishermen than travelers. I thought of Paul's perils by water but the Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were gropeing with in the darkness like the blind for the wall suffering under the pelt cold ^bursts^ & pelting ^hail^ floodsof wind & rain ^of the storms^ & runing the risk of killing both ourselves & animals by riding off steep bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone around about us & revealed untous our perilous situation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf, the light continued with us untill we found a house & got put upon ^learned^ the right road then the light disappeared the darkness returned yet we were enabled to reach the house of Brother Henry Thomas at 9 oclock in the evening, without any harm having rode 20 milesbeing 5 hours in the storm, having forded creeks or [krakes] twenty or moretimes but neither male or female murmured but ^and^ felt to thank God for our preservationoftenI received a letter from Oliver Cowdery at the time that  Warren Parrish was called home. Councilling me to During the winter, ^&^ spring, & for part of the ^summer of 1836^I continued to labour ^mostly alone^ through Kentucky & Tennessee extended my labours openingnew places preaching daily, baptizing, confirming, & organizing new branchesholding conferences &c At a conference held at Brother Clapp on TaropenCalaway County, Kentucky, ^on the 26 day of Feb 1836^ I ordained A O. Smoot & Benjamin BoydstonElders & Daniel Thomas & Benjamin Clapp to the office of a priestBrothers Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labour of the ministryElder Smoot freequently accompanied me upon my missionOn the 21st day of April 1836 Elder David Patten returned to Tennessee to again join me in my labours he Sister Patten came with himI met with him on the 21st day of April 1836 in Henry County TennesseeTennessee it was truly a happy meeting. He related to me the blessings which he had received in Kirtland during ther endowment which was great & glorious & caused my heart to rejoice We travelled & laboured together & preached daily, & continued to baptize such as wouldreceive our testimony persecution began to rage against us in the South Elder Patten bore a very plain & pointed testimony unto the people of the work of God 
 in the last days & when we were opposed by a mob he would rebuke them in greatplainness we were not injured or molested ownly threatened, the sick were freequentlyhealed under our administration. On the 27th of May 1836 we wereagain joined by Elder Warren Parrish direct from Kirtland Ohio who alsolaboured with us. We held a conference on the 28th day of May at Brother Seth Utley ^in Benton County Tennessee^where there was 7 Branches represented containing 116 members Abel Wilson & Jesse Turpin were ordained priest& Albert Petty a teacher. On the 31st day of May I was ordained underthe hands of David W Patten & Warren Parrish, Elder Patten being mouth untothe office of the High Priesthood & a member of the 2nd Quorum of Seventies[FIGURE] Elder Patten prophesied many blessings upon my head. We continued to extend our labour upon a circuit of several hundred miles.Elder A. O. Smoot also laboured constantly with us and BenjaminL Clapp freequently—we would travel at times two by two then we wouldall meet to gether ^to hold conferences &c^ at certain points we laboured dilligently & faithfullyadministering in the ordinances of the gospel as we had an opportunity.Persecution began to rage against us in Benton County Tennessee and on the 19th June a ^states^ warrant was issued against David Patten Warren W Parrish & Wilford Woodruff sworn out by Mathew Williams at Methodistpriest served by the shiriff Robert C Petty Elders Patten & Parrish were taken by an armed mob of about 50 under form of law led by the sheriff a colonel 1st & 2nd Major with other Officers & a Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder, I was in another county & not taken we were accused of prophesying falsely by saying that 4 persons who were baptized should received the Holy Ghost in 24 hours & that Christ would come in this generation. The second time before this generation passed away. The whole concern was a ^mob^ mock trialcontrary to law, justice judgment, mercy or truth. The particulars of whichwere recorded in D. W. Pattens account. On the 25 ^June^ I preached in the Court House in Dresden Weebly County Tennessee to a crowded house wasfollowed by Brother A O Smoot & Benjamin Clapp. On the 27 Iwent to a Baptist meeting house on Thompsons Creek to fulfill a previousappointment when I arrived the house was crowded with people I entered the pulpit & was asked to speak when the Baptist priest Mr Browning arrived on horseback at the door directly steped inside the door in greatagitation & told the Deacons to forbid my preaching in the house 
 at the same time began to talk about the mormons & told severallies which I corrected before the people, this still enraged him worseand I was forbidden to preach in the house I told the peopleas I had been invited to preach to them & had come 10 milesto fulfill the appointment I would like to preach to them, I was willing to stand on a fence, wood pile, on a cart or anyplace they would appoint a man rose & said he owned the land in front of the meetinghouse I might stand upon that & preach & welcome all the congregationexcept the Minister & one Deacon left the house walked across the streetformed seats out of a worm fence & gave good attention while I preached for an hour & a half upon the first principles of the Gospel when I closed I gave liberty for anyone to speak that wishedMr Randolpph Allexander arose & made a few remarks it being thefirst time he had a Mormon Elder speak, "He said the people at the presentday made him think of a pen of hogs the keeper would make a trought &pour into it any thing & they would drink it, hot or cold water, dish wateror anything els, but let a stranger come along & pour over a bucket of corn on the back side of the pen & the hogs would be frightened & run &snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people their priest willfeed the people with ^them on^ any kind of food or doctrine no matter how fals the people will drink it down but let a stranger come & preach the truth as Mrgospel of Jesus Christ which will save the people as Mr Woodruff has done & the people are afraid of him." Mr Allexander invited me homebought a Book of Mormon of me, & was soon baptized and ^as was^ several others were soon baptized in that place.

On the evening of the 15 Jan 1838 a company of sailors belonging to theUnited States Revenue Cutter whose business it was while coasting to protect theLives and Liberties of all American citizens as far as they could they hauledon shore a panel of cannon ^Brought on shore^ a swivel and joined the mob and paraded nearthe house where I was speaking ^preaching^ and discharged it several times followed by smallerarms with the intention of breaking up our meeting, but it ownly caused me to preach the longer and louder as some of the mob gathered around to see what effectit would have I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgmentsof God that awaited the wicked and I shook my garments in the presence of the peopleand told them I was clear of their blood and ^but^ they heard my voice and wordsownly when mingle with the roar of Cannon and musketry, before I had donespeaking they went back on board of the Revenue Cutter taking their arms with ^them^having accomplished nothing ownly showing the wickedness of their hearts, and burningup some powder and grass. at the close of the meeting I baptized 2, also one nextday and while baptizing the mob again commencing^d^ fireing guns but being loaded with

Our child had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly chilled through my whole system ^in crossing the bleak prairies^ ^*Brother Thomas had buried one child and^ that it was two months after I stoped before I got sufficiently thawednearly all the company had been sick through their exposures some of them had stoped by the wayout and warmed up to feel natural. ** We continued travelling untill we were obliged toside we had wallowed through much mud and snow had broaken several axeltrees, andstop in consequence of the bad roads and cold weather, I spent the remainder of^we suffered much upon the journey yet &^the winter laboring with my ^hands^ for the support of my family. On the 8th day of March1839 I attended a conference at Springfield Ill. their was present 8 seventies6 Elders 3 priest and 1 Deacon, several were presented on ordination, we ordained2 Elders & one priest. Brother Brewster was presented for ordination and BrotherDunham strongly urged that he be ordained as did several others. I strongly objected to itfor I felt that the spirit the man possessed was not of God, a strong influence wasgot up in his favor in Springfield, I called a vote of the Elders upon the subject andall voted for him to be ordained except 3 of us two besides myself he thencame foreward d and demanded baptism ^ordination^ at my hands ^in the name of Jesus Christ^ I told him he shouldnot be ordained by my consent, for that was not the way God imparted the Holypriesthood to the children of man he was not ordained and I marvelled that somany should have voted for his ordination after seeing the spirit he manifested

 The ^W. Woodruffs^ Englands Missions of 1840Joseph Smith the prophet asked the Lord what his will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord answered in a revelation given July 8, 1838in which the Lord says Let them take leave of my Saints in the City Far West on the 26 day of April next on the building spot of my Home saith the Lord, Let my servant John Taylor and also my servant John E Page and also my servant Wilford Woodruff and also my servant Willard patriarch be appointed to fillthe places of those who have fallen and be officially notified of their Appointment.It will be observed that different from nearly all other revelations in the instant a day & datewas given and place was given for the commencment of this Mission and when this revelation was given all was peace & quiet And in Missouri & at Far West but before the time being for the fulfillmentof that revelation The Saints of God had been driven out of the State of Missouri into Illinois under 
 under the Edict of Gov Boggs and the Missourianshad sworn that if all the other revelations of Joseph Smith were fulfilled that should not beas it had a day & date to it and they would seethat it should not be fulfilled. It almost seemedas though the Lord having a foreknowledge of whatwould take place had placed a day & date tothat revelation to see whether the Apostles wouldobey that revelation at the risk of their liveswhen the time drew near for the fulfillment ofthis commandment of the Lord Brigham Youngbeing then president of the Twelve (As Thomas B.Marsh had fallen) He called the Twelve together into[illegible] then at Quency Illinois to see what ourMinds would be about going to Far West tofulfill the revelation Father Joseph Smith thepatriarch and others who were present did notthink it wisdom for us to attempt it as ourlives would be at stake and thought the Lordwould take the will for the deed But whenpresident Young asked the Twelve what their feelingswere upon the sub[ject] [page torn] We all of us as in the voice 
 of one man said the Lord God had spoken andit was for us to obey, It was the Lords businessto take care of his saints and we wouldfulfull the commandment or die a trying. Accordingto our revalation on the 18 April 1839 Itook into my waggon Brigham Young & OrsonPratt and Father Cutler took into his waggonGeorge A Smith & John Taylor & George A SmithOn the way we overtook John E Page who wason his way with his family to Quincy Ill Hiswaggon had turned over and when we met himhe was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soapwith his hands, we helped him right up hiswaggon he drove down into the vally belowand accompanied us on to far west. On thenight of 25 April we arived at Far West and spentthe night at the Home of Morris Phelps who wasstill in prison On the morning of the 26 April1839, Notwithstanding the threats of our Enemiesthat the revelation that was to be fulfilled thisday should not be and Notwithstanding thatten thousands of the saints had been driven out ofthe state by the edict of the Governor 
 and though the prophet Joseph & Hyrum Smithwith other leading men were in the hands of ourenemies and in chains & in prison still wemoved on to the Temple Ground in the City of Far Westand held a council and fulfilled the revelationand commandment given unto us, and among other things that we performed at this Council weexcommunicated from the Church 31 person whohad apostetized from the Church and turned to be ourenemies. The mission of the Twelve was sungwe then repaired to the South East Corner of theTemple Ground and with the arrival of Elder ^Alpheus^ Cutler theMaster workman of the building Committee, welaid the South East ^Club^ Corner of Stone of the Templeaccording to revelation there were present of theTwelve Apostles Brigham Young Heber C KimballOrson pratt John E page and John Taylor who proceededto ordain Wilford Woodruff and George A Smithto the office of the Apostleship and as members of theQuorum of the Twelve in the place of those who hadfallen as they had been called by revelationThen vocal prayer was offered up in the following orderDarwin Chase & Normon ShearerBrigham Young Heber C Kimball 
 Darwins Chase and Norman Shearer (who had just been liberated from Richmond prison) were also ordained to the office of Seventies. The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer in the following order Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, Orson Pratt John E Page John Taylor Wilford Woodruff and George A SmithAfter which they sung Adam^on^di Aman and then the Twelve took their leave and parting hand of the following Saints agreeable to revelation viz A Brother Elias Smith, Norman Shearer, Wm Burton, Stephen Pecke, Artemusia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah GrangerTheodore Turley, Hiram Clark, & Daniel Shearer,Then we took the parting hand of this small remnant of Saints who remained on the Temple ground to see us fulfill this revelation of God and commandment of God, and turned our back upon Far West and Missouriand returned to Illinois, and we accomplished this mis-sion without a dog to move his tongue on any man to say why do you so. We reached Quincy crossed the Mississippi river on the steem ferry & entered Quincy on the 2nd day of May and we all had the joy of receiving our families once more in peace & safety un There was an incident unaccounted with our journey well worthy of recordthat while we were on our journey to fulfill the revelation Joseph the prophet & his companions in chains had got 
 liberated through the blessings of God from his enemies & prison and passed us not far distant from eachother without either party knowing it, they making their way for their families in Illinois while we were making our way to Far West into the hands ^midst^ of our enemies so they arrived home to their families & friends before our return. May 3rd was a very interesting day to me as well as others. In company with 5five others of the Quorum of the Twelve we rode four miles out of town to Mr Clevelands to visit Br Joseph Smith & his family we arrived at his home & once more had the happy privelege of taking Br Joseph by the hand two years had rolled away since I had seen his face.He greeted us with great joy as did Hyrum and Lyman Wight all of whom had escaped their imprisonment to gether they had been confined in prison six months and been under sentence of death three times, but yettheir lives were in the hands of God and He haddelivered them and they were now mingling with their wives children & friends and out of the reach of the mob and Joseph was frank open and familiar in ◊◊◊d our rejoicing was great. No man can comprehend feel, sens or understand the joy or sensation that is created by such a meeting 
 except those who have born the Holy priesthood and been in tribulation for the Gospel sake after spending the day together with returned to our families at night. On the day following May 4, we met in conference in Quincy The prophet Joseph presiding which caused great joy to all the Saints, much business was done on the 4, but on Sunday the 5 May Joseph Smith addressedthe assembly followed by Sidney Rigdon & the Twelve Apostles the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us and we had a glorious day.On the following day May 6, I met with the Seventies & we ordained 60 men into the Quorum of Elders & SeventiesBrother Joseph met with the Twelve, ^Bishops^ and Elders of Bishp ^Bishop^ Partridges Home, and there was a number with us who was wounded at Hauns Mill among the numberwas, Isaac Laney, who was in company with about Twenty others at the Mill. A large armed Mob ^fell upon^ and^them^ with rifles and other weapons and shot down 17 of the Brethren & wounded others Brother Laney fled from the scene but the[y] poured a shower of led after him which peirced his body through and through, He showed elevenball holes in his body, there were 27 in his shirt 7 in his pantaloons, and his coat litteraly cut to peaces one ball entered one arm pit & came out of the 
 other another entered his back and came out at the breast a ball passed through each hip each leg and each arm all this was while he was running for life and as strange as it may appear, all those wounds with one broaken rib did not lessen his speedbut he out run his enemies & carried his life we can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power and Mercy of God, president Joseph Young was also among the number He also fled although the balls flewaround him like l◊◊d yet he was not wounded How marvelous are the ways of the LordBefore starting upon our missions to England we were under the necessity of settling our families, And as a place called Commerceafterwards called Named Nauvoo was chosen for our people to settle I left Quincy in company with El Brother Brigham Young & ourfamilies on the 15 May and arrived in Commerceon the 18th and after an interview with Joseph we crossed the river into the old Military Barracksin Iowa, and there took up our alode abode for our Families, President Brigham Young and myself 
 [page covered] [w]ith our families both went into one room [page covered] [a]bout 14 feet square. Finally Br Young obtained a room and moved into it by himself then Orson Pratt & family moved into the same room with myself and family, ^A day of Gods Power^ while I was living in these cabinswith in the old barracks we experienced a day of Gods with the prophet Joseph. It was a very sickly time and Joseph had given up his Home in Commerce tothe sick and had a tent pitched in his door yard and was living in that himself, and the large emigration who had been driven out of Missouri was flocking intoCommerce but had no homes to go into was lying in the waggons in tents & on the ground and many were sick though the expenses they were subject to and Br Joseph had waited on the sick untill he was worn out and nearly sick himself. But in the morning of the 22 July 1839 he arose in themorning reflecting upon the salvation of the Saints of God in their persecutions & affilictions and hecalled upon the Lord in prayer and the power of God rested upon him mightely and he arose up^in the Name of^ as [did] Jesus healed all the sick around him in his daySo Joseph the prophet of God healed all around him upon 
 this occasion he healed all in his house anddoor yard Then in company with Sidney Rigdon &several of the Twelve Heber Kimball & Parley P Pratt who hadjust got out of prison accompanied him and he^went^ through among the sick lying on the bank of the Riverand he commanded in a loud voice in the nameof Jesus Christ to come up and be made whole andthey were all healed and when they had healed allthat were sick on the East side of the river they crossedthe Mississippi river in a ferry boat to the west sideto Montrose where we were. The first home they wentinto was President Brigham Youngs who was on hisbed sick at the time BThe prophet went into hishome and healed him and they all come out togetheras they were passing by my door Brother Joseph sayesBrother Woodruff follow me this was the ownly wordspoken by any of the company from the time they leftBrother Brighams House till we crossed the public squareand entered into Brother Fordham House He hadbeen dying for an hour and we expected each minutewould be his last I felt the power of God that  was overwhelming the prophet of God when we enteredthe House Br Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham 
 & took him by the right hand Joseph [page covered] [hol]ding his hat in his left hand Br Joseph sawthat his eyes were glazed He speechless and uncon-cious He held his hand in his looking him in the sp face He says Br Fordham Do you not knowme[?] at first he made no reply but we could allsee the effects of the Spirit of God resting upon himHe again said Elijah do you not know me[?] with a low whisper he said yes, He then said have younot faith to be healed, His answer a little planerwas I am afraid it is to late if you had comesooner I think I might have been, He had the appearanceof a man waking out of sleep, it was from the sleepof Death Joseph then said do you not believe thatJesus is the Christ, I do Br Joseph. Then the prophetof God spoke with a loud voice as in the Majesty ofthe GodHead Elijah I command you in the Nameof Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. Thewords of the prophet was not like word of man butlike the voice of God. It seemed to me that the House shookfrom its foundation, Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from the dead [to] life and 
 a healthy color came to face, and life was m[an]-ifest in ery act. His feet were done up in Indian Mud poltices, He kicked it off his feet andscattered its contents and he called for clothes putthem on called for a boul of bread & milk & eatit put on his hat and followed us into the streetto visit others who were sick. The unbeliever mayask was there not deception in this, if there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever There was none with Elijah Fordham the dying man norwith those who were present, with him for a few minutesmore he would have been in the spirit world which to day^through the blessings of God he lived up to 1880 in which year^June 24 1880 being 41 years since that event he is alive in the^he died in Utah^Mortal body in Salt Lake City while all who were with him on that occasion with the exception of two are in thespirit world, Among the Number were Joseph & Hyrum SmithSidney Rigdon, Brigham Young Heber C Kimball George A.Smith and Parly Pratt, Orson Pratt & Wilford Woodruffare the ownly two living who were present at the time andwe soon shall mingle with those who have gone. as soon as we left Bro Fordhams we next visitedthe House of Joseph B Nobles who lay very low and 
 dangerously sick when we entered the home BrotherJoseph took him by the hand and commanded himin the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made wholeand he arose & was immediately healed, and while thiswas going on the wicked mob in the place led by oneR Mourn had became alarmed and followed us intoBr Nobles Home But before them arrived in theHome Br Joseph had called upon Br Fordham tooffer prayer and while he was praying the mob enteredwith all the evil spirits that accompanied themas soon as they entered Br Fordham who waspraying fainted & sank to the floor as soon asJoseph saw the mob in the home he a◊◊◊ and bidthe room cleared of both that class of Men and^Devils^ immediately Br Fordham came to and finishedhis prayer, it shows what power evil spiritshave upon the tabernacles of men and the saintsare ownly saved from the power of the devil by thepower of God. This case of Br Nobles was the lastcase of healing of the day. It was the Greatest Day ofthe power of God and of healing members on the Earthsince the organization of the Church and Kingdom 
 when we left Br Nobles, the prophet Joseph wentonto the bank of the river waiting for the Ferry boatto return back home with those who accompaniedhim. We accompanied him to the riverwhile waiting for the boat a man came to JosephSmith of the world, knowing of the miricles which hadbeen performed he having a pairs of twin childrenabout 5 months old old and both laying [each]night unto death aske[d] the prophet of he wouldnot go and heal them but they were some 2 milesfrom Montrose the prophet said he could not gobut after pausing some time he said he wouldsend some one to heal them and he turned to meand said you go with the man & heal his childrenand he took a bandanna red silk hankerchiefout of his pocket and gave to me and told me towipe their faces with the hankerchef when I administeredto them and they should be healed and he said unto meas long as you will keep that hankerchief it shallremain a league between us you and me I wentwith the man and done as the prophet commandedme & the children were healed and I keep possessionof the hankerchief unto this day. 
 Chapter 3rd preparing for our journey & MissionThe blessings of the prophet Joseph upp upon ourheads and his promises upon us. The power of theDevil manifest to hinder our performing our Mission(on the 1st day of July Joseph Smith & his counsellors SidyRigdon & Hyrum Smith crossed the river to Montrose to spendthe day with the Twelve and set them apart & bless thembefore they started upon their missions there were twelvein number & dined at my House. After dinner weassembled at Brigham Youngs Home for our MeetingBr Hyrum Smith opened by prayer After which the presidencylaid their hands upon our heads & gave us ablessing president Rigdon was mouth in blessing me they alsoblessed Sisters Young, Tayler & Woodruff the prophet Josephpromised us if we would be faithful we should againreturn to our families & friends and be blessed uponour missions and have many souls as seals of ourministry and returne again in peace and safety toour families & friends (all of which was fulfilled) Br Hyrumordained us to preach the first principles of the Gospeland thought that was about as much as this genera-tion could endure. Then Joseph arose and preached someprecious things of the Kingdom of God unto us in the power of theHoly Ghost some of which I will mention from my journalEver keep in exercise the principal of mercy and be ready 
 to forgive our Brother on ther first intimation of repentance and asking forgiveness for our Heavently Father will be equillyas merciful unto us also we ought to be willing to repentof ^and confess^ all of our own sins and keep Nothing back and Letthe Twelve be humble and not be exhalted, and bewareof pride and not seek to excell one above another but actfor each others good and honirably make mention of eachothers names ^in prayer^ before the Lord and before our fellow mendo not back bite or devour our brother. The Elders of Israelshould seek to learn by precept & example in this late ageof the world and be oblieged to learn ery thing we knowby sad experience I trust the remainder of the Twelve willlearn wisdom & not follow the example of those who havefallen. When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christstands before the congregations of the earth and they preachin the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and thepeople are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin andsay that that man has preached a powerful discourse,a great sermon then let that man or those men takeease that they do not ascribe the Glory unto themselves butbe careful that they are humble and ascribe the praise &Glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of theHoly Ghost priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have powerthus to speak, who art thou O man but dust, andfrom whom dost thou receive thy power and blessings butfrom God Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israelobserve this [FIGURE] key and be wise, ye are not sent out to betaught but to teach. Let every man be sober be bevigilent and let all his words be received with Grace 
 and keep in mind that it is a day of warning andnot of many words. Act honest before God & men bewareof sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in whomyou have no confidence be ^honest^ open and frank [illegible] in allyour intercourse with mankind I wish to say tothe Twelve and all the Saints to profit by this important keythat in all your trials, troubles, and temptations afflictionsbonds, imprisionsments and death se[e] to it that you donot betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray yourBrethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God whetherin the bible Book of Mormon or Doctrin & Covenants orany of the word of God Yea in all your troubles see thatye do not this thing lest innocent blood be found inyour shirts and ye go down to Hell. We may ever knowby this sign that there is danger of our being lead toa fall & aposticy when we give way to the devil so as toneglect the first known duty but whatever you do donot betray your friend the forg[o]ing are some of the importantinstructions given to the Twelve by the prophet Josephbefore they started upon their missionsIn as much as the devil had been in a means not [prevented]by the Twelve going to Far west & returning without la◊◊n itseemed as though the Destroyer was determined to makesome other affect upon us to hinder our performing ourmission for it seemed that as soon as any one of theA Apostles begins to prepare for starting they were smitten 
 with chills and fever or sickness of some kind nearlyall the Quorum of the Twelve began to be sick and their families so it still required a good deal of faith and perserverance to be exercised in order to start off on a Mission with the chills & fever. On the 25 July for the first time in my life I was attacked with the chills & fever this I had every other day which laid me prostrate each day my chill was upon me My wife Phebe was also soon taken down with chills & fever as were quite a Number of the Twelve I spent 18^days^ in Montrose with my family after I was taken sick before I started upon my missions. The 17 day of August was the last day I spent at home in Montrose and although sick with the chills & fever most of the day I made what preparations I could to start on my ^the^ mission on themorrow a mission of four thousand miles to preach the Gospel to the Nations of the Earth and that to without money purse or scrip with the power of disease resting upon with a shak[e] of the fever & ague each alternate day but but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in him for the recompense of [renewal]. May the Lord give me grace according to my day and ◊c◊◊s for my [ink blot] [fire] & a safe return to my family & friends while f◊◊ter [ink blot] askin the name of Jesus Christ Amen 
 Chapter 4. Leaving my family, starting upon my missionsand Incidents upon the JourneyAug 8, 1839 Early on this important morning I arose from my sick bed, laid my hands upon the head of my wife Phebe and blessed her and departed from her ^the^ embrace of my companion and left her almost without food or raiment the necessaries of life she parted with me with this fortitude that becomes a Saint realizing the responsibility of her compan-ion. Phebe farewell, be of good chear, rememberme in your prayers, I leave these pages for your perusal when I am gone, I shall see thy face again in the flesh I go to obey the command of Jesus Christ. Although feeble I walked to the Bank of the MississippiRiver there President Brigham Young took me in acanoe (having no other [company]) & paddled me across the river I lay down on a side of sole leather bythe post office to rest some Br Joseph the prophet of God came along & looked at me Well Br Woodruff says he you have started on your Mission yes says I but I feel & look more like a subject for the 
 and spent the night with with a Brother Merrills the day following a Brother Perkins ^we rode 10 miles to Br Perkins and he^ took us in hiswaggon and carried us to McComb from thence to Brother Carloss Smith I rode for hours during the day over a very rough road of stones and stumps lying  on my back in the bottom of the waggon shaking with the ague and I suffered much. We held a meeting in a grove near Carloss Smith and here Elder Taylor baptized George Miller who afterwards was ordained a Bishop, at the meeting the Saints gave us $9 & George Miller a horse to help us on our journey, I rode to Rochester with Father Coultrin where I had an interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints which I had brought up with me from Fox Islands in 1838 I spent several days with them and at Springfield where Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies in pamphlet form of a brief schedule of the persecutions ^and suffering^ of the LatterDay Saints by the inhabitants of the State of Missouri. We sold our horse and in company with Coultrin FatherColtrin Br Taylor & myself left Springfield & continued our journey  I having the chills & fever nearly every other day which made it very distressing for me to ride in a lumber waggon shaking with the ague on the 24 Aug we [rode to] Terre haute and spent the night with Dr Modesett 
 but I suffered much with the chills & fever Elder Taylorup to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health butthe Destroyer did not intend to make him an exceptionto the rest of the Apostles for on the 29 Aug he fell tothe ground as though he had been knocked down seemed to havefainted away but soon revived but on the following dayit seemed as though the enemy made a powerful graspupon his life. He fainted away several times and seemed as though he would die we stoped several times withhim at a home by the way side we then took him intoa waggon & drove to Brother Horace S Eldridge and spentthe remainder of the day & night [feeding] him and inthe morning Br Tayler recovered so for that he thoughthe would be able to ride so we started on our journeyon the Morning of the 30 and we travelled 40 miles toLouisville and spent the night with the family of BrJames Townsend. We felt terribly shaken upbeing in such a weak state Br Townsend was absentfrom home but we were kindly entertained by Sister Townsendin the morning Elder Taylor though very weak felt disposedto try to continue his journey. We traveled 14 miles to Germantown was quite sick at night and seemed to have the Billious fever setted settled upon himand I was very feeble myself 
 On the day following Sept 1, being Sunday Br Taylor concluded to spend the day & hold a meeting it wasa German settlement Elder Taylor wished me to speakwhich I did upon the first principles of the GospelElder Taylor followed me & spoke untill he wasquite exhausted not realizing his bodily [condition]we returned to the Inn where we were staying &stopping I was taken with a chill & fever & had a sick night and Br Taylor was quitesick. And the following day sept 2 was a painfulday to my feelings. It was evident that Br Taylorhad a setted fever upon him and would not beable to travel and Father Coultrin was resolvedto continue his journey and in consultation withTaylor he thought it better for one sick man to beleft than for two as I was sick with the chills & feverso that I was not co able to render him present assistanceand not able to take care of myself under these circumstancesBr Tayler advised me to continue with my journey withBr Coltrin and make the best of my way to New-York. Accordingly I done so After committing him 
 into the Hands of God though painful I tookthe parting hand with him I left him in German-town Wayne Co Indiana and in the Hands of a MercifulGod and a kind and benevolent family who promised to do every thing in their power to make him comfortableuntill his recovery, which they did do though hepassed through a severe course of the Billious feverand was sick night [nigh] unto death but through themercy of God he recovered from his sickness andcontiued his journey and we next met in the Cityof New York I continued to journey with Father Coultrinto Cleveland where we parted on the 10 Sept I wenton board of a steamer for Buffalo but was 3 daysand night in a storm before we made the Harbor andwhen we did land it was midnight and do so we raninto a schooner & stowe it in, from Buffalo I traveled toalbany in a canal boat and had a shake of theague daily while on the journey. At Albany I took stagein the night and rode to my Fathers home in Farmingtonon the 21st of Sept I had visited my Fathers familyon the in the summer of 1838 on my way to FoxIslands on my second visit there and I had 
 baptized my father & his household including my step mother & ownly sister & organized a small branch of the Church there of nine members eight of which were my blood relations and I was glad to meet with them upon this occasion as I found them all strong in the faith of the Gospel & glad to meet with me I was still suffering with the Ague daily. On the 27, Sept my Grand Mother (on my Mothers side) Anna Thompson died 84 years of age at Avon, it was a singular incident that she with her husband Lot Thompson and Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thompson all of one family died the year they were 84 years of age I was not ableto attend my Grand Mothers Funeral. On the 4Oct ^1839^ my uncle Adna Hart died aged 43 years I had visited him in his sickness and preached the Gospel to him and he was believing and on his death bed sent me a request that I would preach his funeral sermon I had been associated with him from my youth up I was at the time having the chills and fever daily afflicted with a severe 
 cough so much so that my Father never thoughtI should never leave the home alive but whenthey brought me the request of my dying uncle and theday came for the Funeral, I told my Father to get hishors & buggy ready for I was going to attend the funeralHe thought I was very presumtious as I had sufferedwith the chills and fever some 15 days for and to attempt to speak in my weak state and to beginat the same hour that my chill was to come onwas quite alarming to my parents yet according to myrequest my [Father] got up his team and I rode with himand my step Mother five miles through a cold chillywind and I commenced speaking to a large congregationat the same hour still my chills was to come onand I spoke over one hour with Great freedomand my chills left me from that hour and Ihad no more return from it for many daysOn the Monday following Oct 7, I felt sufficientlyreturned to health to continue my journey I took theparting hand with my Father, Mother, & Sister andleft for New York where I arrived in the Morning of the 8th Nov 
 I spent two months & seven days after my arrivalin New York in travelling & preaching in New YorkNew Jersey & Long Island a portion of the timewith parly & Orson pratt I had freequent attacksduring this time of the chills & fever but I preachedalmost daily d on the 13 of Dec I attended aConference in New York City with Parly P Prattand on that day Elder John Taylor arrived inour midst and it was a happy meeting he hadpassed through a severe time of sickness after weparted but through the mercy [ink blot] of God had beenpreserved and was able to continue his journey. He also informed us that all of the others of the quorumof the Twelve had suffered a great deal of sickness andthat it was with difficulty that they could travelAfter spending 6 days in New York John Taylor Wilford Woodruff & Theodore Turley sailed out of New YorkHarbor for Liverpool on board of the packet ship OxfordOn the 19th day of Dec 1839 and in the Liverpool dockedon the 11th Dec ^Jan^ making the voyage from New York toLiverpool in 23 days we took steerage passage 
 which cost $15 each, we had storms & roughweather, but most of the winds were favorable fora quick passage while on the passage some Methodistpriest got into an argument against some Catholicswho were in the company, and the arguments of the priestsran rather more into abuse than sound argumentand Elder Taylor told the Methodist priest thathe did not think it was becoming in a daughterto find so much fault with the mother as theydid for as the Methodist came out from the Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the Mother hadas much right [ink blot] to enjoy their religionunmolested as the daughter had that closedthe argument, our company consisted of 109 saintscomposed of Englishmen Americans Englishman sctschotish scotish, Irish, Welsh & Dutch,[rest of page blank] 
 Chapter 5 Our visit to preston, our first councilin England, in 1840, we take different fields of LaborJan 13, 1840 After visiting ^Mr. George Cannon^ the Father and Mother of G QCannon and the family after we took cars in theEvening and arrived in the midst of the preston Branchof the Saints built up in 1837, by Elder Heber CKimball & ^Orson Hyde^ Willard Richards and we very soonhad a pleasant interview with Elder Willard Richardswho had remained in preston to take care of theChurches while the rest had returned home to AmericaWe spent three days in preston in visiting the Saintsand on the 17, we held a council at Elder RichardsHome, in preston, Lancanshire England and afterconsulting upon the best plan ^course^ for us to persueit was finally resolved that Elders John Taylorand Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool and ElderWoodruff to Staffordshire potteries & TheodoreTurley to Birmingham his former place of residenceand that Elder Richards go where the spirit mightdirect him and that Wm Clayton preside overthe Branch in Manchester. After various 
 principles of the Church had been explained by theTwelve present the Council adjorned Elder WillardRichards had been called to be one of the Quorumof the Twelve but had not yet received his ordinationOn the day following I parted with ElderTaylor & Fielding who wet went to Liverpool &with Elder Richards who tarried in prestonand Elder Turley & myself went to Manchesterthe first time I ever visited that City, I heremet with Elder William Clayton for the first timeas soon as I had an introduction to himhe informed me that one of the Sisters in the placewas possessed of the devil and he asked me to go andcast him out of her Thinking that one of the TwelveApostles could do any thing they were a mind to. HoweverI went with him to the home where the woman lay inthe hands of three men in a terrible rage and tryingto tare her clothing off from her I also found quitea number of Saints present and some unbelievers whohagd come to see the devils cast out as a miriclewrought. If I had acted my own mind I should [not] [page folded] 
 have attempted to administer unto her with thecompany present But as I was a stranger there and Br Clayton presiding over the branch I joined him inadministering to the woman. But the unbelief of the wickedpresent was so great we could not cast the devil outof her but she raged wors than before I then orderedthe room to be cleared, and when the company leftthe home except the few attending upon her, we laidHands upon her and I commanded the devil tocome out of her in the Name of Jesus Christ, and thedevil left her and she was made whole and fellasleep and the next day being the Sabbath she camebefore a large Congregation of people and bore testimonyof what the Lord had done for her. We had a largeassembly through the day and evening to whom I preachedthe gospel. on Monday morning the Devil not beingsatisfied of being cast out of the woman entered alittle child belonging to the woman but a few monthsold I was called upon to visit the child I found it ingreat distress [unearthly] in its Mothers arms we laidhands upon it and called the devil out of it andthe evil spirits had no power over the Household 
 afterwards this was done by the power of Godand not of man. We laid hands upon twentyin Manchester who were sick and they were ^mostly^ healedOn the 21 I arrived in Burslem by coach andmet for the first time with Elder Alfred CordonThis being my field of labor I stoped and commencedwork Elder Turly stoped in the pottery Districtsome 8 days then went to Birmingham his field oflabor in preaching baptizing bonfirming & blessing childrenI received a letter on the 10 Feb from Elder JohnTaylor at Liverpool saying they had commenced there andbaptized 10 person, I labored in the Staffordshirepotteries in Burslem, Hanly Stoke Lane End andseveral other villages from the 22 Jan untill the2nd day of March one month & 7 days preachingery night in the week and two or 3 times on the Sabbath I baptized, confirmed, & blessed many childrenand we had a good field open for laborand many were believing, and it appeared as thoughwe had a door open to bring many into the Churchin that part of the vineyard 
 March 1, 1840 was my birth day I being 33years of age. It being on Sunday I preachedtwice through the day to a large assembly in theCity Hall in the Town of Hanly and broke breadunto the Saints again in the evening I ^again^ met with alarge assemble of the Saints and strangers and whilesinging the first Hymn the spirit of the Lord rested uponme and the voice of the Lord said to me this is the last meeting that you will hold with this peoplefor many ^days^ I was asstonished at this as I had manyappointments out in that district, when I arose tospeak to the people I told them that it was thelast meeting I should hold with them for many daysthey were as much asstonished as I was In theat the close of the meeting several four came forwardfor baptism and we went down into the watter & baptized them. In the morning I went in secretbefore the Lord and asked him what his will wasconcerning me and the ownly answer I got was togo to the South for the Lord had a great work forme to perform there as many souls were there waitingfor the word of the Lord 
 Chapter 6. My journey to Herefordshire. Interviewedwith John Benbow. The word of the Lord fulfilledto me. The greatest gathering into the Church known among theGentiles since the organization of the Church in thisdespensationOn the 3rd of March 1840 in fulfillment of the wordof the Lord to me I took coach & rode to Wolverham-pton 26 miles & spent the night on the morning of the4 I again took coach & rode through Dudley Stourbridge, Kideministon, Stourport, andWorcester and then walked a number of miles toMr John Benbows, Hill Farme, Castle Froome,Ledbury Hereforshire Mr Benbow this was inthe South of England a farming country, a regionwhere No Morm Elder of the Latter Day Saints hadvisited, I found Mr Benbow a wealthy farmer cultivating300 acres of land, occupying a good mansion and a plentyof means. His wife Jane had no children, I presented my-self to them as a missionary from America an Elderof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had beensent to him by the commandment of God as a messengerof Salvation to preach the Gospel of Life & Salvation 
 unto him and his houshold and the Inhabitants ofthe land. Mr Benbow & his wife wife received me withglad hearts and thanksgiving, it was in the evening whenI arrived having traveled during the day 48 mils by coach &on foot, but after receiving refreshments we sat downtogether & conversed untill two oclock in the morning, Br& Sister Benbow rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings ofgreat joy which I brought unto them of the fullnessof the Everlasting Gospel which God had revealed throughthe mouth of his prophet Joseph Smith in theselast days, and I rejoiced greatly at the joyful newsthat BMr Benbow gave me, that I was standing in themidst of a company of men & women over 600 inNumber who had broaken of[f] from the WesleyanMethodist and taken the name of United BrethrenHad 45 preachers as ^among^ their number, had Chapels &many Homes licensed according theto the Law of the landfor preaching in, and this Body of United Brethren were searching for light and truth but had gone as faras they could, and were earnistly ^earnestly^ calling upon theLord to open the way before them, and send themlight and knowledge that they might know the true 
 way to be saved, when I learned these things I couldclearly see why the Lord had commanded me whilein the town of Hanly to leave that field of laborand go to the South, for I could could clearlysee in Herefordshire a great harvest field forgathering many saints into the Kingdom of God, I retiredto my bed with joy & rejoicing after offering my prayer& thanksgiving to God, & slept sweetly until therising of the Sun; I arose in the morning of the 5th took breakfastand told Mr Benbow I would like to commence myMasters business by preaching the Gospel to the peopleHe had a large hall in his mansion which was licensedfor preaching, and he sent word through the Neighborhoodthat an American Missionary would preach at his homethat evening, the time came, many of the Neighbors came in& I preached my first Gospel sermon in ^his home^ the home. I alsopreached on the following evening March 6, at his homeand baptized 6 persons including Mr John Benbow& wife 4 of four of the six were preachers of the UnitedOrder ^Brethren^, I spent most of the following day in cleancleaning out a nice pool of water and prepared itfor baptizing in as I saw many were to be baptized 
 there. ^I afterwards baptized 600 in this pool of water^ On Sunday the 8, I preached at Frooms Hillin the morning, at Standly Hill in the afternoonand at John Benbows Hill farm in the evening. It wasa remarkable incident that the parrish Church thatstood in the Neiborhood of Br Benbow and occupiedby the rector of the parrish had but 15 personsattended his Church during the day while I had a largecongregation judged to be a thousand attended mymeetings through the day & evening, and as I arose inthe evening to speak at John Benbows house a manentered the door and approached me and informed mehe was a constable sent by the rector of the parrishwith a warrant to arest me I asked him for whatcrime, he said for preaching to the people, I told himI had a license for the preaching ^of^ the Gospel to the peopleas well as the rector, and if he would take a chairI would wait upon him after meeting, he took mychair & sat beside of me, I preached the firstprinciples of the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel foran hour & a quarter the power of God rested upon methe spirit of God filled the home the people were convincedat the close of the meeting I opened a door for 
 baptism seven offered themselves, 4four were preachers, among the number ^offered^ offered for baptism was the constable. He arose &said Mr Woodruff I would like to be baptized, I told him I would like to to baptize him, I went down to the pool & baptized the seven we then met together and I confirmed thirteen, & broak bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced together. The constable wentto the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr Woodruff taken up for preaching the Gospel he must go himself and serve the writ, for he had ^heard^ her him preach the ownly true gospel sermon he had ever heard in his life. The rector did not know what to make of it, and he sent two clerks of the Church of England ads ^as^ spies to attend our meeting to see what we did preach but they were both pricked in their hearts, and received the word of God gladly & were baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the rector became alarmed & dare not send any body ^els^ but the Ministers & rectors of the Church of Englandof the South of England called a convention and sent a petition to the Lord Bishop of Canterbury to petitionparliment to pass a Law to prohibit the Mormons 
 [page covered] [fr]om preaching in the British dominions in this [p]etition the rector stated that one MormonAmerican Missionary [had] baptized fifteen hundred mostly members of the English Church during the last seven months, but the Lord Bishop & Council understanding very well, that the laws of England gave free toleration to all religions under the British flag sent word to the petitioners that if they [loved] the worth of souls at least as much as they did the ground where hares foxes & hounds run they would not loose as many of their flock. I continued to preach and baptize daily. On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder Thomas Kington. He was the superintendant of both preachers & members of the United Brethren, the first thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire I had baptized forty five preachers, & 160 members of the United Brethrenwhich put into my hands one Chapel & 45 homes licensed according to law to preach in, this opened a wide field for labor, this enabled me to bring into the Church through the blessings of God over eighteen hundred souls during eight month labor including all of the 600 united Brethren exept one persons it also included 
 some two hundred preachers of the various denominations This field of labor embraced Herefordshire Glostershire & Worstershire and formed these Conferences Garway ^Garway^, Gadfield Elm & Frooms Hill, I was visited by president ^young^ & Dr Richards, Brother Benbow furnished  us with £300, to print the first Book of Mormon that we published in England and on the 20 day of May 1840 B Young, W Woodruff & W Richards held a council on the top of Malv Malvern Hill, and there decidedthat president Young go dirct ^direct^ to Manchester & publish 3000 copies of the Hymn Book, & 3000 copies of the Book of Mormon this being the first of the publishing of these Books in England. The power of God rested upon us upon this Mission, the sick were healed, Devils were cast out, the lame was made to walk one notible case I will mention MaryPitt who died in Nauvoo sister to Wm Pitt who died in Salt Lake City she had not walked upon her feet for eleven years we carr[i]ed her unto the water where I baptized her. On the evening of the 18 May 1840 at Br Kingtons house in Ledbury 
 Dymock Elders B. Young, W Richards & W Woodruff laid hands upon her head & confirmed her, BrYoung being mouth and rebuked her lameness& commanded her to rise & walk in the Name of the Lord and she was made whole and never used a staff or cruch to the day of her death she walked through the town of Dymock next day which created a stir among the people but the wicked did not feel to give God the glory. The whole History of this Herefordshire Mission shows us the importance of carefully ^listening^ listeninig to the still small voice of the spirit of God, to listen ^to^ the revelations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord had a people there prepared for the Gospel, they were praying for light & truth, the Lord sent me to them I declared the Gospel of Life and Salvation unto them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it and many of them have been gathered to Zion in theseMountains and many of them have been called to officiate in the Bishoppric Bishopricks 
 and done much good in Zion, but for all these things we should ever acknowledgethe Hand of God therein and give him the honor praise & glory forever & ever Amen 
 Joseph Smith presided at a Conference held at Quincy Ill on the 6th May 1839 where it was resolved that 15 of the Seventies Names given also 5 High priest accompanythe Twelve to Europe only two out of the Twenty fulfilled the mission. May 9th Joseph Smith left Quincy with his family for Commerce Ill. on the 9 May and arrived on the 10th & sleped with his family in a log home nearly all of the Churchwho were driven from Missouri soon followed the prophet to Commerce, Ill. On the 9 11 June Joseph Smith commenced dictating his History to his Clerks, who wrote for him. On the 15 May 1839 I left Quincy Ill. and started with my family for Commerce Ill I ownly droveto the Committee House & spent the night. 16th Brother Brigham Young & myself started with our families & drove 15 miles & camped for the night, and on the night of the 17th, wecamped on the bottom of an open prairie. We arrrived inCommerce on the 18th, and called upon Brother Joseph Smith & his family. I also say many other old friends who had been driven from place to place yet th[e]y felt well, & were not discouraged but felt to trust in God. The Saints felt determined to ^try to^ buildup a City wherever they went, Commerce was beautifulfor situations yet there was but two or three buildingsin the town. After spending a short time visiting old acquaintances I crossed the Mississippi River in a ferry boat and landed in Montrose Iowa. This was the first time I ever was in the Terr[i]tory.Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by theUnited States Army. It contained about  12 blocks ofbuildings making about 75 rooms in all. After spendingthe night in Doctor Gallands office, I moved my family and effects into a room on the west side of the publicsquare. This room I occupied untill I started upon my mission for England and my family occupied itafter my departure 
 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having beensick for several days, & his home & door yard containg manyof the sick saints who had been driven from Missouri. Josephrose from his bed with the power of God resting upon himand he took the sick by the hand & in a loud voicecommanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ toarise & be made whole & he healed all that werein his house & around about he then took someof the Twelve with him & walked up the River bankabout a mile & healing all that were sick as he wentalong & they were many among the number was ElderSherwood who lay at the point of death. He crossedthe River to Montrose went into the home where BrighamYoung lay sick & healed him, who walked out of thehome & followed him. The prophet came to where I was standing & told me to follow him I did so wethen went into the home of Elijah Fordham whowas at the point of death, his friends had lookedfor him to breath his last for several hours, hehad lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walkedinto the room Brother The Joseph took brotherFordham by the hand & looking the dying man inthe eyes for several moments. He then said Brother Fordhamin the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comandyou to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophetwas like the voice of God it seemed as though the wholehome shook from its very foundation. And the manleaped from his bed & was made whole instaneouslyHe kicked his poltices off from his feet, dressed himselfeat a boll of bread & milk & followed us out of the houseI went into the House of Bates Nobles who was alsovery sick the prophet healed him & we knelt down & prayed& gave thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeingthe power of God and followed to see what the end wouldbe. After the prophet had healed, all the sick saints inMontrose he with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 to the ferry to return to Nauvoo, a Gentilecame to him & asked him if he would notgo out into the country some two miles & heala pair of Twinn Children about 3 months old bothof which were vary sick. He said I cannot go butI will send a man, who will do just as well. HeTurned The prophet turned to me & said you gowith this man & teach him & his houshold the principlesof faith in Christ then lay your hands uponthe Children & heal them in the name of the LordAt the same time handing me a silk bandannared hankerchief & said wipe their face with thatHandkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keep^ then the prophet returned^this Handkerchiaf it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ home & I went & done as I was comma[nded] & theChildren were healed. The deeds of this day showed me moreof the power of God in healing of the sick than I everbefore saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any dayof my life. I still keep the Handkerchief in memory ofthe prophet Joseph[rest of page blank] 
 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met atFather Cornors & held three meetings through the day and eveningwe red in the Book of Mormon, broke bread to theSaints. I felt the Spirit of God bare testimony tome that there would be a great work in LondonWe retired to rest in good season. I felt well inmy mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at nightI awoke and meditated upon the things of God untillabout 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a determina-tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcomethe powers of darkness which were besetting us day byday and trying to overcome us. As I was formingthis determination in my own mind a personage appearedunto me which I considered was the prince of darkessdarkness or the Devil, he made war with me and attemptedto take my life he laid hold of me like a strongarmed man, I felt like the wait of a heavy manlying upon my body and he caught me by the throatwith a strong grip and choaked me nearly to deathI struggled with him as one man would struggledwith another I, felt as though this destroyer would overcomme & that I must die as I saw no way that I couldescape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to mewhy do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help, I thenasked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliverme from the power of the Devil & preserve my lifeinstantly three personages came throught the door dressedin white with considerable light surrounding them theycame up to the bed side while I was lying in the graspof the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & inthe twinkling of an eye I was liberated & the spirit of Godvibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the soulsof my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a highstate of persperation water stood upon ^me^ in drops. As soonas I could speak I spoke to Brother G. A. Smith &I found that he had been labering under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had beenseeking his life as well as my own, and he wasdelivered in the same way. the three personages thatappeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude thinkover sisx feet the other m[i]dd[l]e one was another man wasmedium size & the 3rd was a short man they we[r]e all clothedalike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing butas soon as they laid hands upon my head & I wasdelivered they disappeared, I felt thankful to God forthe presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage record thisin one of the blank pages & refer to the page)Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and manyother Saints I attended a discussion in the evening heldat the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester. One MrBarrett had tried hard for a length of time to getsome of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him, thoughhis continued teazing [president] Brigham Young told himthe Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject withhim but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonismhe would appo[in]t some body to meet him, as Mr Barryttwould not take no for an answer Brother Alfred Cordonwas appo[in]ted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were wasa beardless boy yet he had been ordained an Elder &received much of the Spirit of the Lord and they metfor this purpose at early candle light, the Stand wasoccupied on one side by my Methodist Priest, & on theother side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lytedby 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighthed withgass there were some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-self to prove th Book of Mormon false & water baptism^not^ essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon plegedhimself to prove the Book of Mormon true & waterbaptism essential to Salvation.  As Mr Barrytt arose& declyaired to the Assembly that he would prove the Book ofMormon false & water baptism not essential toSalvation 4 glass chimneys in each of the chanderliers burst 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the CongregationAnd the man who had tended the gass in the Hall saidfor twenty years said he had never knownany [wei[r]der] of the kind. the chimneys were replaced& the discussions went on I set by the side of DoctorW Richards, and at the commencement of the meetinga very interesting old gentleman appeared in the congrega-tion he sat at the end of a seat joing the ally nearthe platform, He made me think of what he s is said ofthe Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & restedin a large white roll upon his shoulders, he was a noblelooking man he eyed us with great interest &penetration, he occupied his seat to our view thensome half an hour I called the attention of DoctorRichards to him we both looked at him with feelingsof both interest, some little disturbance in another partof the Home attracted our attention & when wereturned our eyes to the seat of our interesting visitorwe found his seat vacant, & he had disappearedthere for the first time we felt that we had beenvisited by John the Revelator or one of the threeAncient Nephite, however the discussion went onMr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordon greivedthe victory, & quite a number of the methodist who attended that discussion, was baptized & joined the LatterDay Saints 
 Autobiography of Wilford WoodruffThe remaining months ofthe year 1841 was spent by theTwelve, after their return fromthis successful mission in Gto Great Britain, in settlingtheir families in Nauvoo andtaking charge of the affairs ofthe affairs Church. Severalnoteworthy events took place at thistime among which were thededication of the baptismal fontin the Temple by the Prophet andthe Twelve and the first adminis-trations of the ordinance of 
 baptism for the dead, both ofwhich occurred on Sunday Nov 21st,1841. A large congregationassembled and Elders BrighamYoung, Heber C. Kimball andJohn Taylor baptized about fortyand persons and Elders WillardRichards, George A Smith andWilford Woodruff confirmed them.During the following weeka company of about 200 Saintsarrived from England, and I wasnow again in the midst ofhundreds whom I had baptizedin America, the "Islands of the Sea"and England and Wales. 
 Just before the April Conferencethe Prophet administered theordinance of rebaptism to theChurch, baptizing many himself,among whom were the Twelve,who afterwards assisted himin baptizing and confirmingthe multitude. This was thefirst time I was rebaptized. Atsince my [ent] the ProphetJoseph administeredthe close of the administrationthe Prophet lifted up his handsto heaven and blessed the people and the Spirit of 
 God rested upon the congregationAt the April Conferencethere were 275 ordained tothe office ^under the hands^ of Elders, BrighamYoung, Heber C Kimball,Orson Pratt, Lyman Wight,Willard Richards, George ASmith and Wilford Woodruff.offi While these ordinations weregoing on Elder John Taylor wasin the stand delivering adiscourse to the multitude,while others of the Elders werebaptizing and confirmingat the font and elsewhere.

In attendings the Su^n^day School in myearly Boyhood, under Dr Noah, porter andlearning [cler◊◊ts] by heart, I saw what Jesus Christ 
 And the Apostls taught. These principles were so finely imprinted in my mind ^that^ I could never join any chor^urch,^ [receive] the churches of to ^that^ day did not Believe in them, untill I heard Zera Pulsipher, a Mermon^ormon^ Elder preach to me & my Brother Azmon ^* and a large congregation of neighbors^ in Richland, Oswego Co., N^ew^ York, ^before^ with a large congregation of Neighbours,at the same time on the 30th day of Dec. 18303.  On ^hearing^ the first sermon I & my brother Azmon ^were convinced, and we^ wentforth & wasere Baptized on the 31st of Dec 1833,which will be 59, years ^ago^ the 31^st^ of this month.1862 ^¶^ I went up in Zion's Camp, in the spring of 1834, to Missouri, to the assistance of our people who had been driven out of Jackson CO^unty^. There are but Very few of the ^members of that^ Camp ^are^ stillLiving to day. That thousand miles journey with the prophet Joseph Smith, in 1834, gave ^was to^ me a school of Experience that I shall never forget in this world nor the world to come.

 President's Office,Saturday, October 15 [18]87Report of a private interview heldbetween President Woodruff and UnitedStates Marshal Dyer.After some general conversation,Marshal Dyer said,—Well, Mr. Woodruff, I am gladto see you out and I hope to see moreof you.President Woodruff — Yes, I considered 
 it qut quite a privilege to get out andlook on the faces of the people at Conference.Marshal Dyer — There is no need for you to be uneasy.President Woodruff — I really don't think it would add particularly to the interest of our great government to takea[nd] shut up, for marrying a wife or two,an old man 80 years of age.Marshal Dyer — Of course, that is a long discussion.  I have always takenthe stand that stringent laws ought to 
 be passed. I think the thing hasbeen trifled with, and the government has been criminally liable.  I havealways taken the view that inasmuchas there are so many people who havegone into polygamy when they con-scientiously believed it was right, andthere was no specific law againstit — I say in a case of that kindthat if Congress had said we will letyou go ahead and won't fall out aboutit; but any fellow that goes into it 
 now we will punish him so thatit will be a terror to him. Othershave done different; but we are not re-sponsible for what others did before.The facts are, that in my opinion allthe people here lost their heads the last two years. I think that the Gentiles,encouraged with a little favors thatdropped to them; got wild and ex-pected that in a moment they were going to be able to pick up everybody 
 that stood in their way and sendthem off somewhere.  On the other hand, your people were just as stubborn,and nobody seemed disposed to meethalfway.I will tell you, that, as far asyou are concerned,—I have no hesita-tion in the world; I would tell it to you on Main Street just as soon asI would here — you shall not bearrested, unless the Grand Jury shalltake the case up themselves and indict 
 you.President Woodruff — Thank you.Of course, that is a favor; it is a privilege to walk out in open day-light and among our people.Marshal Dyer — Well, I don't knowas there has ever been an attempt foryour arrest. I have bothered lessabout your case than any otherman of prominence in the Territory.I didn't even know who your family 
 was.  I have never looked into thematter enough to know that.After some further conversationwhich was of an unimportant character,Marshal Dyer retired. 
 Vision of FarnsworthOn a clear still day about 1 oclock pm about the time of the ringingof the bell for the Temple Hands to commence work in NauvooAll of a sudden the Heavens assumed a heavy gloomy appearanceAnd the Saints in Nauvoo appeared to be all in confusion anddowncast countenance and the 12 Apostles commenced councelling theSaints to gather in from the varioust settlements and prepair for a longjourney to the west. They gathered together started in waggons as far asthe eye could reach, after travelling some time the journey seemedto be accomplished and much easier than was anticipated & mattersseemed to assome a bright & more cheerful appearance and prosper-ity attended the Saints for a short season. All on a sudden a terribledark cloud arose & continued to thicken and grow more terriblein appearance untill every ray of hope or prospect of escape seemedto be cut off. At this time the Authorities of the Church all appearedto be absent. Brigham Young came in suddenly into our midst followedby the Twelve, & commenced councilling the Saints to be of good cheer& see the Salvation of the Lord, but by the dark & gloomy appearance ofsome the advise seemed to have but little effect & the first I knewthe Church seemed to be gathered together in a circle with 3 strongIron Bands around it & Brigham leading the 12 with smallMallets in their hands like masons mallets they were passing around tappingand driveing the hoops. This was the first time I noticed the absence ofJoseph & Hyram Smith, and I felt troubled & weighed down onaccount of it while Brigham & the 12 were thus driving & tightningthe hoops they appeared to have the most determined, fierce, resolute,countenances I ever beheld & the Saints seemed to be pressed almostbeyound endurance actually driven to the point of starvation and theheavens assumed a terrible asspect at this time. A thought aroused mymind and I was just about giving the utterance to the expression that the Saintscould not stand it any longer when all of a sudden they burst the hoopsasunder and sumthing more than half of them ran like frightened sheepJust at this moment the black cloud that overspread the Heavens burst instantlyover our heads and the countenances of the Authorities that before hadseemed tyranical & oppressive instantly changed to the most heavanly& pleasant appearance all our troubles were instantly banished 
 And I could not help giving utterance aloud to the expressionI am glad I stood a moment longer and Brigham took thecompany aside into what appeared like a cellar & spread before themthe most beautiful luxuriant feast that I ever beheld from this timethe Saints were of one heart & mind & the power & glory of Godrested upon them & the elements & all things were subject unto themand as I was contemplating upon the scenery through which we hadpast, the spirit of the Lord came upon me & showed me through it, thatit was necessary for the Saints to pass through just such straightenedcircumstances & trials in order to sift out those who are unworthy toenjoy the blessings that we now enjoy, the cloud that first hungover the Saints rolled off upon the inhabitants of the United Stateswith tenfold vengance, such scenes of vengance famine pestilance andbloodshed followed that it is out of my power to describe. The Churchstarted South for Jackson County Missouri, myself & some otherBrethren were passing through a lane in Jackson Co, we saw aMissouri mobacratt vary malicious in appearance coming towards uson the opposite side of the road & when about opposite to us his eyecaught ours he immediately withered & disappeared.  From the [ink blot]of the dark Cloud to the close of the vision I have no recollectionof seeing any women or children. Amen[Sideways Text]Vision of Farnsworth[End Sideways Text]

 hearken unto my voice, and the counsel of myServants, the wicked shall not prevail. Let myservants, who officiate as your counselors beforethe Courts, make their pleadings as they aremoved upon by the Holy Spirit, without any furtherpledges from the Priesthood, and they shall be justified.I the Lord, will hold the Courts, with the officers ofGovernment, and the nation, responsible for theiracts towards the inhabitants of Zion. I, JesusChrist, the Savior of the world, am in your midst.I am your advocate with the Father. Fear not littleflock, it is your Father's good pleasure to give youthe Kingdom. Fear not the wicked and ungodly.Search the scriptures, for they are they which testify ofme; also those revelations which I have given tomy servant Joseph, and to all my servants sincethe world began, which are recorded in the recordsof divine truth. Those revelations contain thejudgments of God, which are to be poured out uponall nations under the heavens, which include 
 Great Babylon. These judgments are at the door, theywill be fulfilled, as God lives. Leave judgmentwith me, it is mine saith the Lord. Watch the signsof the times, and they will show the fulfillment of thewords of the Lord. Let my Servants call upon theLord in mighty prayer, retain the Holy Ghost asyour constant companion, and act as you aremoved upon by that spirit, and all will bewell with you.  The wicked are fast ripeningin iniquity, and they will be cut off by the judg-ments of God. Great events await you and thisgeneration, and are nigh at your doors. Awake,O Israel, and have faith in God, and His promises,and He will not forsake you. I the Lord will de-liver my Saints from the dominion of thewicked, in mine own due time and way. Icannot deny my word, neither in blessing norjudgments. Therefore let mine Anointed girdup their loins, watch and be sober, and keep mycommandments. Pray always and faint not; 
 exercise faith in the Lord, and in the promises ofGod; be valient in the testimony of Jesus Christ.The eyes of the Lord and the Heavenly Hosts arewatching over you and your acts. Therefore befaithful until I come, I come quickly to rewardevery man according to the deeds done in thebody, even so, Amen.[rest of page blank]

 Hon A. W. BabbitDear SirThe deep interest I feel at heart for the general good interest & welfare of the inhabitants of the State of Deserett at this critical & important crisesis the apology I offer, & the ownly motive that induces me at this time to address you by Letter. as I may not have a per[s]onal interview with you which I should be vary gladto have befoe your arival at Congress Washington or our petition is presented before Congress, I wish to suggess present a few items for your consideration. In the first place I will ^wish to^ say I have not been Idle since I learnedthat the inhabitants of the vally had organized a State Governtment & that you was their delegate to Washington but I have endeavored to do all in my power to assist the causein any way that I could, and I am fully convincedfrom what I have learned from various sources & classesthat a most judicious, wise, discreet & prudent cource must be carried out in this affair in order to secure successI also firmly believe that you ought not to commityourself in the least by taking sides with the democratswhigs, Free Soil, or any ^othr^ party for by so doing at the comm[encem]entof the service I belive it would be certain death, to your success but take a Neutral groud at first & watch the signsof the times & then act according to circustances you will probably meet with the most exciting Congress that ever assembled in the United States, & the parties are so even bal[anc]ed 
 that to take sides with either party at first would defeatthe Bill altogether, I think have an influential friend who is vary intimate with the members from Maine who will use his influence for them to go with for our Bill I have assisted Dr Bernhisel conc[ern]ing the petition what I could, & He has had an interview with many influential men & He has always taken a Neutral ground which I think is a wise courcse & the ownly safe one at the commecent [commencement] of this session And I hope you will have an [interviewed] with him at the earliest opportunity & that you will be enabled to unite your influece & council together And my prayer to God is that you may be prospered in this laudible & glorious enterprise, and that prudenceWisdom & success may attend you in obtaining a seat for Deseret in the circle of her sister States is the cincere desire & warmest wish of my heartYours TrulyWilford WoodruffP.S.

 Philadelphia Pa Nov 27th 49Col KaneDear SirIn my reflections I have thoughtthere might be some dubiety resting upon your mindin regard to the views of the inhabitants of the Stateof Deseret upon the subject of Slavery in consequece of their not introducing a clause in there State Constitu-tion prohibiting Slavery. I think your interestingvisits in our midsts, your travels in our encampments,your clame of observations in our families Assem-blies & Councils whare the sentiments of our hearts havebeen freely poured out before you must all combineto convince you that the inhabitants of the State ofDeseret will never sustain in any [wise] the institutionof Slavery in their midst. We are a peaceful andindustrious people have removed to the sequestered vallyof the Great Salt Lake. we do not wish to have anythgto do with the "vexed question of Slavery" or any of theother exciting political questions and therefore we deemedit expedient not to introduce a clause into ourConstitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves intothe State of Deseret but Slavery can never beTolerated thereWith Sentiments of the highest RespectI remain yours TrulyWilford Woodruff

Dec 5th=49Brother BernhiselDear SirI sent you a few lines last night ^eveneg^written in great Haste, as the boat was about to start but one itemwhich I intended to have mentioned was omitted which I consider quite essential and which I did not think to mention when Isaw you.  If I mistake not the petition to which the signers namesare attached calls for a Territorial Governmnet if that is the case itappeares to me that that petition should not be presnted befoeCongress by any means untill it is altered I think that wisepolicy would dictate that the word Territory be not so much asonce named in any petition or address which you have tolay before congress in the request which is now made at therehands, but State and State alone the ownly thing we ask forand with my present feelings I pray to God with all my heartthat sooner than to have a Territorial Govenment given us thatthey may not be permitted to give us any ^a^ Govement at all unlessby all means we could have our own Govenor & other offcerswhich is a vary uncertain matter, if we could not get a Statewould it not be better to withdraw the bill or petitions aswe afterwards could again present a petition for a state whileif we were a Territory we could not do it perhaps for manyyears besides all the trouble that would arise from Haveingofficers & polititions among us who would have no interest in ourwilfare I throw these things [out] as they rest upon my mindfor your consideratin this subject is increasing upon my mindand rests with wait upon me more & more day & night & is uppermostabove all other considerations and I do not know but I feel as muchinterested in it as though the whole concern rested upon my shouldiersfor it is not a work merely to aggrandize or set up any one man or set 
 of men to get some paltry office a little salary or a namebut objets far more Noble & glorious are at stake in whichwe areall feel an equal interest.

 [sideways text]Copy of A letter writtento A W Babbitt EsqrJan 21st 1850[end of sideways text]Cambridgeport Mass Jan 21st 1850Dear SirYours of Jan 16th has just come to hand and Imust Confess that I am much surprised at its contents and do not understand it. and I feel think it needs some wisdomto answer such letters in a right & proper manner lest misun-derstanding arise of an unpleasant nature between men who are endeavoring to bring to pass the same object. It it's is also often more difficult to explain many matters and things by Letter writing than itis in personal Conversation, However I will venture to come to the subjet you say you have not recieved a letter from "any one haveing influencin the Ch[ur]ch" "Or from any leading men in the Chuch" Now I maynot be a proper judge what amount of influence I may have in the Ch[ur]chStill I believe I have some and have endeoved [endeavored] to use that influenc for the general good of the whole to the best of my ability" I write youa letter by Dr Bernhisel who was going Direct to Washington to cooperate(as I supposed) with you) for the vary purpose of laying a foudations to Correspondwith you. The following was the closing remarks "I should essteem it a great favor to meet in council with you & Dr. Bernhisel at Washington but do not now expet to have the oppertunity" I should take it as a faver if you would write to me occasinally and infore me of your progress & prospets" This letter you recieved. On my I also addressed a short note to you while at New York as a Letter ofintroduction of Mr Copway who was expeting to go [Soon] to Washington you may not have reci[ev]ed it. After being absent from Home on my Western tour two months during which time I addessedassemblies of some kind almost every evening during my absence &tracting constantly by day, I arved home wearried out whae I fo[un]d 
 instead of finding rest I fo[u]nd a vary large nuber of lying before me some 25 ^[many]^ letters from vari[ou]s parts of the worldamong them was one from Dr Bernhisel & one from yourself. I also had rec[eiv]ed among othr thgs an Epistle from the valley& Letters from the presidency ^in the valley^ requiring certain things [of] ^me^ my hads which required me to correspod with the Ch[ur]ches which I have to do by lettr writing as I have No other way of Communi cation with them, and Hence I need to write some 50 Letters & maillast Week and am[on]g [thous] I sent one ^one of that [nuber] I sent^ to Washington which I happened to write and address to Dr. Bernhisel instead of yourself as I had Nothing to communicate except what was from the valley & that I expeted you would both receve before minewoud arive in the form of a visit from Messers Haywood & Wooleyor by the Epistle, still lest you should not receve it I [send]it in [my] letter to Dr. Bernhisel, and if ^my^ I had had time ^had permtted^ I should have ansued both letters, or if I had known that or even th[ou]ght that it would have made any difference in your feelings, or that you ^[consdered] you^ was slighted I certainly should have add[r]essed you instead of him, But such a thought neer entered my mind. In addressing him or if I had addessedyou upon that subject it would have been the came with me for I should have Had no othr thought but that one comunicatin to either of you Concning any News from the valley would have been Communictated to equally to both, for I had the not the mostdistant idea but what you were haveing a free exchange of views & sentim[en]ts, in a sotcial manner, almost daily, for the Dr Berhisel hadneer hinted any idea contrary to it in any communcation to me. I wrote to the Dr as We had spent Considerable time in social con-versation upon a variety of subjects, ^just previous to his going to Washington^ & I should liked to have enjoyedthe came privilege with your self, that is the ownly lettr I 
 have writtenthe Dr ^Berhisel^ Since my return Home.  I Haven gotrecieved a letter from him to day by the same mail thatBrought yours. As to ^the^ accusations against me in the phrasologey of wanton Neglect in not writing you is an accusation that I shall not recieve for I am not guilty, in in that sense of the wordand I think friends ought to study each othrs Circumstncessufficiently at least to lay a fondatiun for reasonable excuseswhae their is any seeming neglect towards us before we ac◊eethem to strongly. I wrote you a letter to lay the fondation for a Correspondane you answered it and the following is your closingremak "I will keep you informed of all matters & things transpiring hereas touching our common Interest," that letter it is true I didnot answer." In this it may hve appeared to you a [seemg]neglect, still I do not think from that circustanc you are warranted in taking the strong grounds in which you accuse me, for in reality I did not intend any neglect whatev◊efor as I hve already explaned I thoght one Com[mun]icati[o]n every Western officers ^upon the subjet which I wrote^ would answer for both this in Connexion with my being overwhelmed is business was theownly reasn why I did not write to both, and agn frm your last sentanc I judged that I should hve reced [received]anoth letter from you before long. So much I hve [said]for myself, As conceing Mr Hyde I have ownly to say that I have no knowledge concing am [any] instructions He may have recieved from the presidency concing your mission or any othe Subject any further than what is made public through the prress. For although I hve been travelling in this Easten Contry a[mon]g the Chches, for near two years & senthim many ^a dozen or more^ letters, containg some 60 or 70 subscribers for the Guadanyet I have [never] as I recollet recved but two commd◊tes 
 from Him of any kind, and that mostly cncing [concerning] a [poer] of Attornyto collet some mo[ne]y for some powers in Iowey. Yet notw◊hst◊d◊all this I have not for a momet suffered the spirit of prejudiceor Jealousy to take root in my heart agaist him as though He was neglecting me or was not interestaed in my welfare or prosperity, or equally ingaged in the same Common cause with myself, and I have not felt in the least [to][imparte] it to any other cause ownly that He was overwhelmedin busness & cares.  I am aware there from conversationwith yourself & public papers, that [there] had been a ^former^ differenc betwng you & Mr. Hyde But since that He has pub[lis]hedthrogh the Guadian that it was all made up & [settletled] & I had no idea but that you were on the best of termsBut to sum up the whole matter ^of this subjet^ my views are thoseThat the cause ^in which^ you are ingaged in is of Equal interest to yourself, Dr Bernhisel, Mr Hyde, myself,  and evy good manwho expets to become a Citizen of the State of Deseret, and I consider that any man who has any different veiws of this subjet has a wrong one. Men may differn in politics, I nevr castany other vote at the poles in my life, even my Father before me that I werehve any knowledge of, except a Democrat vote, still & consider our petition to Congress for a Goverment for Desereta vary differet thing from party politics, I consider it arecommon cause for all the inhabitants of that Stat whether[thy] [they] be wDemocrats Whigs or Free soil and I consider anylawful or legarl influenc extented to eventually give Deseret a State Gvement to be of interest & worth to her inhabitats let it eminate from what party it may. This I have given you my views concering thesee points in your letter that needed explanatinas feel as I am enabled to do in a communcatin of this ki[n]d a[n]dI hope it will be satisfactory as far as I am conceed [concerned]. 
 [sideways text] Copy of A Letter to J. M. BernhiselMarch 26th 1850Cambridgepot MassMach 26th 1850Brother BernhiselDear SirI receved your interesting Letterof the 22nd intat and nothing but a croud of businss hasprevented me from you upon the subjet of whichyou speak even befoe I receved yours. I was privilegedwith the company of professor O. pratt Erastus Snow & J B.Wallace on the Sabbath & I convrsed freely with thoseBrethn upon the Subject & I find but one spirit & opinionprevailing amog us & that is, it is far better to withdrawthe petition for the present untill you can consultyour constituents than to receive a Territorial Gove[rnmen]twith Military polititions sent unto our midst to tyronize[ovr] us who has no interest in our welfare it is myfirm conviction that the Citizens of Deserett will sustainyou in withdrawing your petition for the time beingrather ^than^ to receive a Terratorial Gov[ernmen]t with the spiritof restrictions that the present Congress manifestin disposition to lay upon us. Yes Brothe Bernhiselwatch well the signs of the times in this matter donot let a n[e]t be flung [ovr] the people of Deserettto their inquiry they should have the rights of Citizenshipas well as other people. The president has recomede[n]din his speach a thought that the people of the Basin 
 would not suffer materially if they did not geta Territorial Government immediately or something tothat Effect. I am of his opinion I think so to Ithink it would be a good plan to take his advise& withdraw the petition! If we want a TerritorialGove[rnmen]t we can call for it another sessionIf we want a State Govern[men]t we will be inalso be in a situation to apply for it if we arenot confined under a Territorial.Thus you have my views & I pray God to sustain& uphold you & lead you right.Mr Babbitt informed me in his last that ifth[e]y gave us a Territorial Govern[men]t at allthey would send Pharaohs to rule over us. I haveexpressed my feelings to you in other Letters freelyupon those points I am the same nowI wish to know if this reaches you in safety drop me a line soon. I shall leave Here the evening of the9th April via N York & Phila I have altered mymind about the Northern parte as the lake is notclear.

 Vision.In the winter of 1874 my mind was very muchexercised in regard to the parable of the 12 olivetrees; ##Doctrine and Covenants 101:43-62|doct. & cov.## page 279 old ed.After a social chat with father Johnson of BelleviewCave Co. one evening upon this subject we retired.The vision began by finding myself walking up Mainstreet, Salt Lake City going north. When I arrived atZ. C. M. I. drug store, I saw coming from the directionof the Salt Lake Theatre, soldiers on horse back, twoabreast going westward. They had instruments ofdestruction in their arms reaching almost to theground, similar in appearance to english fireengines made of fine brass. They commenced to dis-mount opposite Kimball & Lawrence's corner andplaced these instruments on the street opposite thestores extending from Kimball's corner to marketsquare. I passed them and went unto the marketsquare. I saw the yard of a large prison with twoiron gates towards me, which were very high, witharched spiked tops and arched brickwork abovethe gates. Between the gates & myself were fromtwo to three hundred (2–300) of our brethren;all without hats.  They were very clean & appearedvery cheerful.  In their midst I beheld the prophetJoseph and his brother Hiram.  They looked very muchpleased and their complexion was very much fairerthan any of the rest. The spirit said to me:"There is brother Joseph & Hiram, they have cometo meet & welcome the spirits of these, your brethren 
 on the other side of the vail. But the brethrendo not know it, for none see them but you."At this moment the soldiers came and beganto th take the brethren and lead them on thesidewalk in front of the stores and before theinstruments above attended to. I soon began tohear the cries and groans of agony of the brethrenand thought I would take a walk eastwardtowards the theatre to see what was going on inanother part of the city. As I turned the corner ofthe theatre I found the streets filled with gropups ofgentiles. Fences were broken down and people werestanding in the lots the same as in the streets.When I arrived at the Gardeau house I sawa large prison standing in place thereof. Thecorner facing the street corner was of octagonshape with a large door some 8 or 10 feet above groundwithout steps leading thereto. I was [saw] an iron doorwith visible one inch square headed both fromtop to bottom fastened in diamond shape. Whilstlooking at this door, a stout heavy built manopened it from within and stood on the threshholdand said these words: They are just doing right, tokill these damn Mormons, damn them, they oughtto be killed every last one of them. Some of myfamily have been silly enough to join them and ifthey kill them, damn them, serves them right.They preach of a resurrection and a hereafter.I believe when a man is dead, he is done with,and to hell with him." At the same timeturning about and slamming the door behind him. 
 I thought these were very strange proceedings,turning to leave, I found that an acquaintanceof mine from England was standing at my rightside. This was a surprise to me and I said tohim: "Helloa, Bob, what are you doing here?"  hisname being Robert. He said: "I am looking onlike the rest of the people." We turned the cornerand walked along Brigham street until wearrived at Main street. Then continued southuntil Kimball & Lawrence's corner. When we cameto the corner, I saw at once that the soliders and^civilian^ gentiles were butchering our brethren abovementioned. It seemed, they had attached the instru-ments to their bodies and were pumping theblood out of them, it running into the gutter,where it froze, until it resembled beef suet inconsistency but in color like blood. The firstman I noticed as being active in butchering wasa gentile. He arose from among those whom he hadslain and the blood was dripping from his fingers endsand from his coattails as though he had been liftedout of a pool of blood. I walked along the edge ot thesidewalk between the dead & the gutter. As I started,this friend of mine said: "We are Mormons why don'tyou kill us?" Which brought a great fear over me,and I thought of leaving him, for I felt I had notcourage to look over either my right or left shoulder.When I came to the other end of the row of deadbodies, he was also there with me and again said"We are Mormons, why don't you kill us?"Another gentile arose from a stooping posture from 
 among the dead and said: "Well, if you are, lookhere, by hell, if you ain't out of this in two minuteswe will serve you like these." pointing at thesame time with his right hand towards the slain.I stepped across the gutter and noticed the sunwas standing in midheaven.The spirit said: "St George is the best place for you."I started to walk and when I did so I noticed, about3 blocks square of buildings south of this scenehad entirely disappeared. So I walked acrossthe ground in a southeasterly direction and passedthe Elephant store and came to the state road.I had not gone far south, when I came to a broadcanal. I looked for a bridge, then a footbridge, butcould not find any. And the only way of crossing itwas, by holding on to a fence rail, which reachedacross the canal on the opposite side of the road.The moment I stepped on the rail to start across,my Redeemer stood upon the road ground Ihad just left. As we were looking at each otherearnestly, he said: "Thou wouldst not be afraidto die for my sake, wouldst though?" Which causedme to tremble and shake before him and say:"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I do pray thee,to give me of thy holy spirit, that I may be found true& faithful in all things, even unto death."  He againsaid: "Thou wouldst not be afraid to die formy sake, wouldst thou?" And I again answered"O Lord, thou knowest all things, but I praythee to give me of Thy holy Spirit, that I may befound true & faithful in all things, even unto death." 
 then I walked the fence and put my feet on the south side of the canal to go to St. George.At this moment I awoke and heard the clockstrike six (6) in the morning, trembling and ingreat fear at what I had seen and heard. I toldmy wife all that had transpired and in a fewmoments I was again in the society of my Redeemer.He showed me some things in his hands which hemoved about and said: "Thou seest these, butthe time is up now, but behold, I will showmore unto thee at another time."All this was given unto me on the night, whenPres. Young and Geo. A. Smith staid at Belleviewfor the last time during Bro. Smith's life ontheir way to Salt Lake City.Part IIIn Midsummer of the same year, at St. George,the following vision was given me:I found myself on horse back traveling betweenHamilton's Fort and Cedar City going north.When I arrived about a mile south of CedarCity, I began to meet the Latter day Saints ofCedar City coming south with their teamsof horses, mules, oxen, horse men and peoplewalking afoot 6 and 8 abreast old & young,male & female between the hind end of awagon and the head of a team.  They were walkingbecause their wagons were overloaded with grain& provisions. I rode along the side of the traintowards Cedar City. I noticed the people werevery cheerful.  The spirit said to me: 
 "The Latter day Saints are being murderedin the north for the Gospel's sake and thosethat are determined to serve God are fleeingto save their lives. But we are only going tobe driven to St. George, and there stand still,for we have been driven all we intend to bedriven, for there we will stand still and seethe salvation of our God or die for Zion's sake."Then I rode on to the center of Cedar City andthere saw the last man putting the last halfbushel of wheat into his wagon which justfilled the wagon box, and bringing a spiritof peace to me, thinking that he was the lastman, and that he would be out in a few momentsand that then all the people of Cedar City wouldbe safe on the road to St. George.I rode quickly back and overtook the trainoutside of town. A thought came to me, wonderingif the Saints would come from towns beyondCedar. I turned the head of my horse eastward& put the spurs to him, and as quick as thoughtI was on the peak of the highest mountainwith my horse turned around and lookingnorth. I saw the road, as it were as straight,as an arrow from Cedar City to Summit,filled with teams, wagons, horsemen & peoplewalking afoot, just about to enter Cedar Citywhen Cedar City people had just left on thesouthern side. Thus ended my vision.Witness to signature:Hermann TascherYour Bro in the GospelJames Booth 
 A Vision,As seen by Newman Bulkley, on the night of the8th January, 1886, in Springville, as related by himself.I retired to rest about 9 o'clock in the evening.In a short time I drowsed off to sleep, and it seemedas if the spirit of my dead wife was hovering 'roundabout me. Suddenly I awoke and sleep departed fromme, and the vision of my mind was opened, and Ibeheld the members of the Senate of the United States,while in session, they were hurled from the Hall byan unseen power; they rallied again, and the secondtime were thrown from the the Hall; they rallied the thirdtime, and were again thrown from the Hall with suchviolence that a great number of them were killed; allthose that remained alive had the name of Edmundsprinted in their foreheads. Next I saw a whirlwindcommence in the centre of the House of Representa-tives, which increased until it frightened all the mem-bers out of the House, and they then scattered to variousparts of the United States, and the inhabitants of thecity of Washington became frightened, and scattered, un-till the city became almost desolate. Then I saw a greattumult commence all over the United States, whichended in a great deal of blood being shed, and a greatmany of the people that had heard our Elders preach,and had believed what they had heard, but had not hadthe courage to embrace the Gospel when they heard it,gathered up what little effects they could take with them, 
 and came to this people in the mountains. Then I sawmany thousands of women and children take refuge inthe timber, hazel rough, ^brush?^ or any place where they couldconceal themselves from the turmoil that was going onin the States, and when the word reached this people oftheir situation, there were hundreds of the Seventies call-ed upon to go and hunt them up, and bring themto this people in Utah. Then the Government of theUnited States patched up their difficulty, and electeda new congress, which assembled again to do business.The crusade still continued against the Latter-daySaints. Our enemies attributed all their troubles to theSaints, and the crusaders raised such a howl and sentforth their petitions to Congress, that the first businessthey did was to order one hundred thousand of the bestand most able bodied men that could be obtainedto come against us. When this became known to theSaints, instructions were sent forth for all of the inhabi-tants of the Territory to gather into valleys, as near aspossible to the Temples, and the people gathered into SaltLake, Cache, Utah, and Sanpete Counties, and to St. George,until there was a family to nearly every acre of land,and all the country around was filled with our people,and water broke forth where before there had been no wa-ter, so that all the land could be cultivated. I saw also,that all the old men who had honored their priesthood,became spry and young again. I also saw that the greater 
 number of those that had gone into polygamy for theprinciple thereof, had to go to prison, while those that hadembraced if for lust escaped, as the officers appearedto care nothing about them. I saw no preparation ofany warlike demonstration in the midst of the Saints,but all appeared to have the spirit of peace and con-tentment, and when the soldiers came near our borders,then the United States officers and all the Gentiles wereseized with fearfulness, and left in haste by night andby day, until they all got outside of the borders of this peo-ple, and united with the soldiers. Then the army surroun-ded this people on every side, and there was no possibleway of escape; they then raised their standard and sentforth a proclamation to all who wished to save theirlives to come to them for protection. About one thirdof our men, and as many women as they could per-suade to follow them, went over to the army and joinedit. Then I saw the preparations commence for the entiredestruction of the Saints, which consisted in their ene-mies gathering together all the combustible material theycould obtain, making a complete wall all around thispeople. It looked to me to be some fifty feet high,and from six to ten rods wide on the bottom. Duringthe time of their gathering this combustible material, ourpeople were laboring in the Temples, endowing men withthe fulness of the blessings of the priesthood, setting themapart, and placing them along the borders of the Saints 
 for their protection, and when the enemy had fired theircombustibles, these men, endowed with the holy priesthood,walked along like sentinels on their posts, and wavedtheir hands, and the flames, and smoke, and ashes, thatwere intended for the destruction of the Saints turned up-on our enemies, and when this combustible matter wasconsumed and the fire and smoke had cleared away, lo!and behold the enemies of this people were not to befound. During all this time, our people were laboringin the Temples day and night, endowing the Elders ofIsrael with the fulness of the blessings of the holy priest-hood, until they had got the number of fifty thousandendowed. The Temple in Salt Lake City, during thistime, had been completed, and in one of the rooms,situated in one of the towers, Jesus and Joseph, withtheir councils, were setting. Then preparations were madefor the fifty thousand to go down to the Centre Stake ofZion, with Jesus and Joseph at their head, riding intheir chariots of fire; they seemed to be somewhere aboutfrom six to ten rods above the earth. While all thesescenes had been transpiring, the remnants of the land hadgathered in from all quarters East of the Rocky moun-tains, and some had come from South America, andwhen our brethren passed down to the Centre Stake ofZion, the remnants went forth and redeemed the landof Zion. I saw the foundation ^of the Temple^ laid there, which had theappearance of a bright lustre. The chariots or pillar 
 of fire remained over the Temple Block, giving lightto those who remained below. When any attention wasdrawn back again to the mountains, I saw that the youngmen and middle aged had been called away upon dif-ferent missions, and the old men and women and chil-dren had to do all the farm work, and all those whowere laboring to build up the city of Zion in JacksonCounty, had to be sustained from these valleys, with theexceptions of the remnants of the house of Jacob. Thebuffalo and other game had returned upon the plains,to feed them until they could be taught the art of agri-culture. The earth in the valleys was sanctified andcleansed, so that it brought forth in its strength, andinstead of its bringing forth from 15 to 40 bushels pr.acre, it brought forth from one to two hundred bushels.The water broke forth in parched ground, and all thesevalleys were filled with Saints of the Most High, whichhad gathered in from the nations of the earth to be school-ed in the Temples that are now built ^and that will yet be built,^ to prepare them togo forth to the Centre Stake of Zion. I saw all thispass before the eyes of my understanding, and when ithad passed once, it was repeated again, which occupiedabout the whole of the night. I turned over and tried tosleep, but sleep had fled from me, and soon it wasdaylight. I was not asleep, but was awake during thewhole time, and I arose filled with the glory of what Ihad seen resting upon me. 
 (A Dream) Dreamed by a SisterIn FranklinOn the night of Oct 8th 1883, I dreamed thatI, with my husband, my parents, and his parents, withmany of our friends, was in the meeting house, attending aparty, where all appeared to be enjoying themselves, morein social chat than dancing. I was standing alone nearthe steps leading to the stand, when I saw one of the brethrensitting near the first window, on the south side, turn and speak to his wife, who was sitting near him. She immediatly calledme, and bade me look out of the window at the heavens whichwere filled with writing. I was very much frightened at what Isaw, and screamed, bringing the whole assembly to witness thescene. I saw in the Central portion of the sky, visible from thewindow, a scroll, on which was written in letters, 15 or 18inches high. The passage, (Enter ye in at the Straight gate)to the north of this was written, (The law shall go forth out(of Zion, and the word of the Lord, from Jerusalem,)also, (Except ye become as a little Child, ye canin no wise, enter the Kingdom of heaven)To the south was written, (Prepare ye, Prepare ye, the(way of the Lord) Zion shall be established(In the tops of the mountains) The earth is the(Lord's, and the fulness thereof.) Judgments are(to Commence at the house of the Lordalso. (The Lord will Comfort Zion.)These passages with many others, some of which I have never beforeseen, were all grouped around the first one given, which was theonly one placed in a scroll, and the others, were in smaller letters,also I saw, Search the scriptures, for in them ye 
 (think, ye have eternal life) (Judgments areabout to be poured out upon the nations,)Repent ye, Repent ye, for the Kingdom ofheaven is at hand,) Every bit of the space in theheavens, was filled with writing, and I thought was seen by everyperson in the Hall. I thought I turned and asked some one standingnear, what could be the meaning of this, and if it could be, thatthe Savior was to appear. And as I turned, the walls of the buildingwere written on in numerous places. At the west end, was written,(And a little child shall lead them, )and further along, (Except ye become as a littlechild, ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdon)It appeared that the stove pipe was in the center of the room, Atthe west end of the house, and on it was written, on the north side,Blessed are the meek) near the stand, so that thename would be partly on the stand, was written in a sort of a bracket,and like the scroll in the heavens:(Render Obedience to your Leaders)As I stood looking at this, I saw the name of the Supt. of ourSunday School written, but in smaller letters. I felt to wonder, whyhis name was the only one written, and was deeply mortified on accountof it. I waved my hand towards the name, and he looked, and saw hisname with a feeling of thankfulness. The name disappe^a^red without beenseen by anyone, but the two of us. Every one appeared to be greatlyexcited, and very much frightened at the wonderful scene. Iturned and spoke to a friend, wondering if the saints who saw Angels,In the Kirtland Temple, felt any of the awe, and fear, which prevadedthis gathering. We all gazed at the writings for some time, and then 
 went to our homes, and stood in groups talking in the streets.There were many passages of great beauty, that I never saw before,that have passed from my mind. I can now in my mind, see theletters, but it is as though a vail was drawn, through whichI cannot distinguish them.[rest of page blank] 
 height I could see a great distance, andthe Saints were completely surrounded and no wayof escape apeared. I found myself carried forwardon the back of a noble steed, which caried me overevery barier unhurt, much to the shagrin of thosewho oposed the church of God. All at once I beheldthe lightness of a day whose light was beyond thebrightness our days, yet, soft and beautiful to beholdand all apeared hushed. I there beheld menwho ^wonce^ belonged to the "who wonce belonged to thechurch" in company with the wicked, theyhad joined in helping to build up abarier or high wall to prevent the escape ofof one Soul, and so well did they gaurdand cary out their plans that the Saints werecompletely surrounded and escape apearedimposible. I then beheld a large multitude ofSaints gather together they stood very close togetherfrom what apeared to be a pressure fromwithout, in the midst of the vast multitudeof Saints "who apeared to be clothed in white robes" thetwelve stood up, with our beloved presidentJohn Taylor in their midst, the twelve werecalm but strong in the Lord, and clothedwith power from on high and this power wasmade manifest, even to the dividing asunderof those who were oposed to the Church, thencame a great struggle, and as soon asthe fainthearted and those who had joined thewicked saw the power of God they feignedfriendship but the day had passed. 
 the power of God manifested itself amongthe whole Preisthood and deception wasimposible and many were destroyed by theServants of the Lord, because they could desernby the Spirit all that were true to the Kingdom.I saw one man who, when he discovered the powermanifested, he drew near to a brother, and said,I am a Bishop but it availed nothing, hehad associated with the enemies of the Churchand he met his distruction. I felt the finaltriumph had come and I was led to exortthe Saints to gather around and sustain theauthority of god vested in the twelve for init rested our Salvation. I lay upon my bedfor some time meditateing upon my dreamI was impeled to arise and write the aboveand my prayer was that the Saints maybe awake and not be fainthearted, ourenemies will triumph for a season, butblessed is he who shall continue faithful tothe end AmenThomas Harris[rest of page blank] 
 Womans DreamThe DreameI looked and beheld in theEast just above the mountainsa beautiful city in the cloudsof heaven the cloud wasperfectly smoothe and of a brightpink coler and sloped Eastfrom the bottom to the topso as to give me a plain viewof every house in the city thehouses was all of a beautifulcream coler but difered insise and workmanship eachhouse had steaples pointingto the sky and there was lovelywindows boath in the manebuilding and the steaples a bove.And while I looked I called theattencion of some one thatwas near me to this cityand and I thaught they said noit is not a city but a fleete of 
 ships. And while I was lookingwith all the powers I had tosee something that resembleda ship. Behold I see a heavenlymessenger a Boy a bout 12 or 14I should judg by the size andhis face was turned westwardand he came from that cityin the clouds to the Earthand while he was in the aira bout 50 or 60 feet a bove theEarth he had in his handa piece of paper a bout 12 x 20 incheswhich resembled a show bill informe and had blue letters printed uppon it he held itin his wright hand andwaved it to and fro as ifheralding something to thewhole Earth then he turnedit loose and it fell to theEarth some one picked it up

 Mr. PhippenSir believing you to be familliar with the wordof God & considering you willing to instruct your inferiors upponspiritual subjects, & after forming such conections of your characterI take this method to ask ^you^ several questions for information &instructions as I have no other motive in view, & should younot consider it beneath your notice to answer my questionsby writing but give me your opinion as you have formed itfrom the word of God it would be highly interesing to meThe 1th is respecting the gifts that were in the ancient church the gift ofhealing the sick raising the dead casting out devils &c.2th the Sabbath & its changes.3th & last is the subject of babtism. Firstly, while perusingthe sacred volumen of inspiration I find many wonderful workswere performed by our Saveiour and likewise by the apostles though notby their own power but by faith in & through Jesus Christ& if I mistake mot when Christ first sent his disciples to preachthe gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of israel he commandedthem to heal the sick cleanse the lepers rase the dead cast out devils &cS. Mathew. chap. X [Matthew 10] again in the last chapter of S. Mark [Mark 16:14-18] Christ appeared tothe eleven as they sat at meat & gave them a varry forcible commandto go into all the world & preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he thatbelieveth & is baptized shall be saved & he that believeth not shallbe damned & these signs shall follow them that believe in my nameshall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tonguesthey shall lay hands on the sick & they shall recover &c this apparentlywas the last command given by our saveiour before he assended toheaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when & wharewere those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I findno scripture satisfactory to prove that they ever were done awaytheirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancientdays & likewise should people at this day live as did the apostles & exercisethe faith that did Abraham in offering up his son Isacc that those giftsmight again be on the earth and in case of sickness we mightloock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm offlesh. we read of a woman that was ill that had suffered many thingsof many Physicians & had spent all that she had & was nothing better butrather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. [Luke 8:43-48]should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasentday undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lordtold Ezekiel their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the houseof israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information(the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy mowithstanding they would not hear& ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) 
 secondly; with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regardthe first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appearedto Moses on the mount he commanded him to keep the seventhday as the sabbath & not to labour on that day, [##Exodus 20:8-11##] so it appears that if their has mot been a change of the sabbath we as a body are notkeeping the day that we ware commanded to keep still it is held upto view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it motallowed that their has mot been no change in any of those commandsthat were given to Moses at the time that the command of the bsabbath wasgiven & why has the sabbath been changed while the other commandsremain good & sacred & while we are under them & ought to obey themit is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week & thatthe work of Redempttion was greater than the work of creation & this theyappear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefullyperuse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurrection ofChrist does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose onthe seventh day as first, & even did Christ really rise on the firstday of the week does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath& if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would theirmot have been sumthing said respecting that change so that theevidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath wasthen perfected. sir this is a subject that has some length of timeocipied a seat in my mind & I lay it before you considering youhave far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself & wouldwish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understoodthe scriptures to be verry plain respecting the change of the Sabbaththe third & last is the subject ofbabtism & it is a subject to that has long lain with wait onmy mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledgeto take the word of God & make it the man of our council & formour principles theirby still we may benefit by the instruction ofthose that are more experianced than ourselves I for one Considermyself transacting business for Eternity & I believe that Jesus Christsat the example for the pilgrain to follow & I believe that the christianought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthoughI for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmostoverwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the differenceof opinion & principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjectswhen we have all the sane bible to read the same spirit to directbut more especially uppon the subject of babtism. my mind haslong been seleled with regard to this subject still I have remainedsilent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that evry person ought tobe fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much dependsI had the ordanonce of infant babtism administered to me but it doesnot answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to supportit from genesis to revelation 
 & if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mystereyto me how so many great divines that have been so long holding up the light of the gospel & still continue in so gross an error withrespect to babtism. for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no accountof John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance  of babtismuntill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they consideredthem true believers & that appeared to be all that was required of themin order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the sonof God & if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believers& respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is noroom for one a moment to doubt but that our saveiour was buriedin babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtizedware buried with Christ in babtism & setting aside evry other examplebut the one that Christ left us that alone ought to be sufficientto convince mankind that emmersion was the rite & ownly modeof babtism (to use the language of Dr Daddridge Jesus had no sin towas[h] away & yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to makeit a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him & this ought to silenceevry objection to the practice)many advance the argumentthat those things are not escential but may we mot with the samepropriety say that when Abraham was called to offer his son Isaacthat it was not essential whether he offered his son or a lamb outof his flock & who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord wouldhave received Abrahams offering with a blessing & given a blessing inreturn had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, & why should any believethat infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God forbabtism as to follow the example that our saveiour hath givenhas not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ & if mankind everenter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him [##John 14:6##] isf sothen ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts& not climb up some other way.Mr Phippen as I amconvinced of the mode of baptism, & believe it to be essential tomy prosperity & happiness the information that I wish you to communicateto me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle & disciplineto administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to beproper subjects without joining the Church for I at preasent am notprepared to unite ^join^ with any church still I feel it a duty to be babtized& would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subjectbut have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized & Ihave rather been waiting for him. sir I have ^not^ intended any harmby asking those questions & I wish you to excuse all you see amiss inmy remarks & by answering me you will confer a great favouruppon Willford Woodruff

 Beloved Parents – I am now about to leave my parentalpaternal roof for a while but I know not how long – but not without grateful feelings for the kindness which Ihave received from my infancy untill the present time, –but Providence seames to order it otherwise now than it has been. Let us commit all these things into the hands of Providence and be thankful that we have been permittedto live togather so long under so favourable circumstancesas we have, believeing that all things will work for our goodif we love God supremely. Let us realize that we canpray to one God which who will hear the sincere prayers ofall his creatures and give us that which is best for us.May we strive to have that spirit in us that raised Christ from the dead that our mortal bodies may be quickened andcome forth in the morn of the first resurrection to reign withChrist a thousand years where parting will be no more. Glorious thought may it ever stimulate us to be diligent in keepingall the commands of God and not count our trials here too much togaine such a prize. Mother, I believe it is the will of Godfor me to go to the the west and I have been convinced that it has beenfor a long time. now the way has opened and you seem to bereconciled to it which is the greatest conslattion to me of anything earthly; I believe that it is the spirit of the Lord thathas done it which is sufficient for all thing. O be not anx-ious for your child the Lord will comfort me, I b^e^lieve that the Lordwill take care of me and give me that which is for the best. If itis for the best for me to go there and lay down this body I thinkI feel willing and what matter is it where this body lays untillthe resurrection when I hope and trust ^that^ we shall all rise Aboveall the trials of this life. Let it not be to you as though I h^a^d donesome crime and was obliged to leave my home which would be far worseif I know my hart I can say I go because my Master calls – he has made my duty plain; Believe not that all these things [a]re against youfor they are not, although the ways of Providence seem dark; I shall comehome to see you the first suitable opportunity whither I like or not

 My dear Brother.I have but little spare time,But I will exppropriate these first few momentswhich I have been able ^to^ catch from my numerous calls–to answer your very interestingquestions! Let me say to you I am [please] youtook the liberty to propose them. I shall al-ways be ready to listen to any similar re-quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.Your first question respects the Sabbath& its change.GOD having finished his work of Creation in sixdays, ceased [and] rested therefrom on the seventh,& set it apart for the more solemn worship of himself by men. & as an emblem & pledge of their eternalblessedness. Gen II 1. 2.The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath. thoughwe have no particular account of it.The "End of days," when Cain & Abel offered theiroblations & The day when the sons of GOD met togetherin Jobs time, doubtless were Sabbath days. Gen -IV. Job I - 6& II. 1.When GODs ancient people were fed with Manna fromHeaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a doubleportion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbathwhich should be gathered & that none should be gatheredon the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. Exodus. 16. 23 
 Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re-garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai.But to mark the perpetual & universal obligationof the observance of the Sabbath, GOD proclaimed thelaw of it from Sinai [&] wrote it in a table of stone,along with the rest which are allowed to be moral;Exodus XX 8-11. Injunctions to keep it & threatenings forthe breach of it, are every where found in the law &the prophets.The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation.How is it changed from the seventh to the first dayof the week?In answering this question I would observeI. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh partof his time, rather than any particular day.It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, keptthe same day which they kept after that event.Nor is it certain that the same cronology was obser-ved at the giving of the law at Sinia–which hadbeen observed before & after the flood.But however Cronology might alter–A seventhpart of the time would be the same in all ages.II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORDof the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from theseventh to the First day of the week.To mark the devine authority of this change,he on that day, made repeated visits to his de-ciples - John XX. 19. 26. On that day he bestowed the miraculous gifts & graces of the Holy Ghost - Acts II - 1. 
 III This is called the LORDs day.The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christarose & to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation says–This is the day which the LORD hath madelet us rejoice & be glad therein.John the Revelator calls the first day the LORDsday - Rev - 1 - 10.IV The primitive christians met for public wor-ship & made their collections for the poor onthe first day of the week. Acts 20. 7. Cor - 16.They also met on the evening of the first dayof the ^week^ & their devine LORD repeatedly metwith them.I close these remarks by observing–That thereis an alarming laxness among christian pro-fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. & thatwe might all awake to righteousness, on thissubject.In answer to your second question ofn the subject of miracles–I answer in general,I. Miracles were wrought for a definitepurpose in the Apostolic age–summarily to establish the devine authenticity of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus.That object has been accomplished. The evidence arising from miracles a lone, is clear 
 convincing & overwhelming.II If we should exercise strong faith in GOD, andlive at the fountain head of holy influencethat is–should we watch unto prayer, and pray without ceasing–should we daily fearto sin & daily deny ourselves & take up ourcross & follow christ–should all professorsof religion persue this course–doubtless awonderfull change would be effected atonce in the state of the church. but evenin that case I do not see that the churchwould have any authority to attemptto perform such miracles, as were performedin the Apostolic age.They doubtless would shed their holyinfluence all around & be instrumen-tal in the conversion of thousands of souls–& the glorious Gospel would be spedilybe preached to all who dwell upon theearth. For christians would feel thatall they possessed is christ's & they would most cheerfully devote themselves theirtime, talents, property, privileges,spirits, souls & bodyies– with their presentall & all they ever expected–to theservice of their dear LORD & Master.Let us pray fervently my dear brother, thatthe LORD would hasten this glorious state ofthe church.Then will the deciples of Jesus be instrumen-tal in performing as great or greater miraclesthan did the Apostles.As it respects yourIII. Question. I would observe that itis in my view, always desirable that thosewho are baptized should join a church– anevangelical Church. But I am ready tobaptize all persons who apply to me to administer that ordinance–provided theygive evidence of evangelical piety.That the blessed saviour would directyou alway & into all truth & finally bringyou to glory is the prayer of yourfriend & brother.George Phippin.Willford Woodruff.Canton Janry 7 1831.Wilford Woodruff[upside-down text]George Phippin's answer toWillford WoodruffJan 7th 1831[end of upside-down text] 
 Kirtland O. January 4, 1836Dear BrotherYours came to hand 8 or 10 dayssince. I hope you will pordon me for notwriting sooner, for I feel that I have a just causeto be excused. And this because of a multiplicity ofbusiness.The Hebrew School commenced this day, and Ihope that I shall be able to attend it some, butout of necesity I will be excluded part of thetime because of the press of business.You have no doubt an idea in regard tothe endowment and if you should suppose thatGod intends to endow a man to destroy anotherbecause he repents not, I would inform you thatyour idea is incorrect, but I presume that youhave no such an idea. God will indow noman except he has obtained wisdom and under-standing enough to use power with discretionand according to the will of God. I presumethe solemn assembly will take place in Febru-ary if there will be no hinderance in the comple-tion of the house.I have written a letter to br Seth [Willey], andno doubt you have seen it ere this, had Itime I would write a long letter to you. ButI have not. And Elder Parish wrote you andyou have the Bible Book of Mormon & Book ofCovenants these together with the Sipirit of God, willwill make you wise unto salvation, and give youinteligence to lead others into the mansions of bliss. I am sensible that you feel your weeknessin the midst of a gainsaying and idolotrous generationwhile in the days of your youth, and so for painyour brethren ^the [prophets] &c^ But be not dismayed trust in Godand you shall not be confounded, for rememberwhat our Savior saith of the the Ravens, and of theLillies of the field, they toil not neither do they spin but 
 our Heavenly Father clothes them, and will he notdo as much for one of his Young servants; yesverily he will clothe them with wisdom and inteligencethat they will be able to confound the wise. God hassaid he would choose the weak things and the unlearnedto bring about his works in these last days. Therefore,comfort yourself with the above sayings and manyothers that time would fail me to enumerate, and theyare familiar to yourself, continue to be faithful andthe God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob shall be your guardand your defence and your suporter in every timeof need. Keep yourself unspoted from the eviles ofthis generation and you shall be blessed foreveramen.I have complied with your request in regard to sending extra Nos. of Star & Messenger.I have forwarded J.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, SidneyRigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely tothem, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of businessnow on their hands, ^and the request of J Smi◊th Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things inKirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, thatyou viewed those things in their true light. Great has been theafflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our belovedBrotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.In the pastsummer; I Journeyed from this place in company with WmSmith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose ofmeeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: thesehowever wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leavingKirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Josephand the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlementwas not of long duration. Soon after this, President HyramSmith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: andPresident Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ WmSmith, soon followed us to Far West: and during theirabsence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, LukeJohnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather infor the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith andhis company returned on or about the 10th of December;soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Churchof Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught BrJoseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned fromRigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by takingupon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of theChurch of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, whichsaith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, andthe greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given tothe people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saintshere alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as theabove prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yetfuture, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most◊ [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move-ment of things here, as they are and have been.You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company withElder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, inthe summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature andresult, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poorbleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of theChildren of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundredand fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & JohnWhitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, insteadof laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleedingZion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerallydid their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishopor High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land WithChurch funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,but because they selected the place of the City Far Westand appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to bebuilt on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed andordained a committee to build the same, withoutasking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints ofGod.These two presidents also managed to get the town plottinto their own hands, that they that they might reap the availsariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, withmany other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day ofApril 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishopand his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time theyadjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the 
 5th, and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanim-ously agreed upon, that the town pPlatt, with 4 ^four^ eighties adjacentto the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his councilthe High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles.During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and theyto all appearance willingly suffered themselves to be corrected by the Council.In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolvedto to have the above m^n^amed property transfered into the hands ofthe bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding Zion money, and that the avails, of said land, should be thareafter applied to the benefitof the poor, and other public purposes. The business of the transferof said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his coun-cil, and by some meanes they managed to bind the bishop in a heavymortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^Which they had subscribed^ tothe building of the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erect[e]d;Since that time, the affair of building the house has falen through.Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscr[i]ption toit, and these two men, claining this two thousand dollars as theirsubscription, chuse to withdraw it, and put it into their own pockets.aA small part of which has been already paid to Wm W. Phelps.The Council, not feeling ^willing^ that the Church should be defraudedof two thousand dollars of her public funds, and also know^ing^ thatthe Church in general as well as themselves, had become dissattisfiedwith their conduct as Christians, in many things, appointed acommittee to labour with them: after which, they called the wholechurch in Zion togeather, who almost unanimously voted themout of their presidenceal office.Not long after this, the Councilsaw cause to appoint a seecond committee, to wait on these menwho still presisted in their opposition to the interests a [page torn]the Church. aAfter which, charges were prefered against thembefore the Council, which were substantiated, and they wereexcommunicated. Also, the Church has had much sorrow durringthe past winter, on account of the unfaithfulness of O. Cowdry,David Whitmer, and Lyman Johnson, and in consequence of this, andTheir opposition to our beloved Brother Joseph Smith Jr, andthe best interests of the Church of Jesus Christ, ^[On]^ for presisting inthe same, a number of Charges have been substantiated againstthem, before the Councils & bishop of the Church, and they have also been excluded from fellowship. "How has the gold become dimthe most fine gold changed"!!! But I mus[t] drop this subject for want ofroom. Suffice ^it^ to say Brethern, J. Smith Jr & S. Rigdon are nowwith us, the Church now flourishes, and the Saints rejoice,and the ^internal^ enemies of the Church are down. You will see by the aboveprospectes, that your anxious desires for the Journal are about to be granted.May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, bless you, and keep you untohis coming and Kingdom, Amen! My love to all the Saints in thoseregeons.Yours in the Love of God.Thomas B. MarshWilford Woo[d]ruff 
 [sideways text] P. S. Since Br Joseph Came to this place, we have been favored with a lengthyrevelation, in which many important items are shown forth! First. that the Church, shall hereafter be Called "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" Seceond it saith ^says^ "Let the City Farwest be a holy and aconsecrated land unto me, and it shall be called most holy, for the groundupon which thou standest is holy: Tharefore, I com[mand] you to build an houseunto me, for the geathering togeather of my Saints, that they may worship me". [&c]It also teaches, that the foundation or corner stone must be laid on the 4thof July nex[t], and that a commencement must be made in this following season,and in one year from the 26th of April last, the foundation must beagain commenced, and from that time, to continue the worke untileit is finished. Thus we see that the Lord is more wise than men, forPhelps & Whitmer thought to commence it long before this, but it wasnot the Lords time, tharefore, he overthrew it. and has appointed hisown time. The plan is yet to be shown to the first presidency, and all thesaints, in all the world, are commanded to assist in building the houseThomas B.

 Hill farm, Frooms Hill Ledbury. Herefordshire, March 25th 1840Elder W. RichardsDear Brother. May grace, preace, strength, faith & victory, rest upon you & Sister Richardsfrom God our father & our Lord Jesus Christ. Dear Brother ^it^ is amid peculiar feelings that I take upmy pen to address you this morning. I have so many things in my mind at this time thatI wish to communicat & so little time & room to do it in that I hardly know whare tobegin or how to End. I feel that there never was a store House ten story high filled from topto bottom with Merchantdize that cant have more of a variety in it than I have in my mindat this time. & I hardly know how to go to work to give you a description of my situationbut I will try to do it by parible. figure, similee or sumthing or other. I am far fromfeeling vain vane or like trifling lent I take the Liberty of making expressions to you that Iwould not to the world, that you may ketch my view of the situation of things here. In the firstplace permit me to say that I never before witnessed such a scenery as I am Experiencing hereneither did I every expect to in my generatoion. The Lord of Hosts is with me in power & sonesome of the time the Devil to. I have had some mighty Battles with the devil sword in hand sinceI have been here & God has enabled me to give him a deadly wound & routed him out of his camp & he has fled from me wounded & roaring like a Lion [&] I can hearthe sound of his roar about 10 miles off & I expect him to return for an other Battleby & by for you are aware thant an Enemies camp cannot be brock up without somenoise & so you can form sumthing of an Idea of it from the following description.I have been here 21 days preached 20 times & Baptized Mr Thomas Kington the superintendant of thepreachers of the United Brethren, a branch of or broke off from the Methodist Church & with Mr Kington I Baptzed23 preachers of the same Order that was under his superintendance & also I Baptzed 46 of the membersof the same church making 70 in all, this scenery has committed into my hands & charge& my controll mostly 45 esstablished places of preaching most of which are licensed according toLaw, & also 48 Preachers 24 of which I have already Baptzed & most of the rest are ready as soonas they can have an opportunity. as I said before I say a gain their will be a mighty harvesthere for all the churches which these preachers are over are ready to receve the word. should I judgefrom outward appearances I should think their would spedily be 500 Baptzed in this region &probably more still I dont wish to count chickens before they are hatched. I am now Baptzingabout 10 daiy daily day before yesterday 12 & yesterday 9 sone days I have to go in the water 3time a day. I Baptzed 6 preachers yesterday & I have a number to Baptze to day. yesterday 3preachers came in a charriot or Gig to visit me they never had herd me preach at all. I had on wetcloths & going to the pool to Baptze. I testified of Jesus Christ unto them the power of God rested uponus & they kneeled down & wept & prayed, & their Gig stood still & they all went down into the poolthe same hour & I Baptzed them & they went their way rejoiceing & praising God. Mr Kington is anhumble man I have Ordained him an Elder & I ordained two priest their will be many worth[y]labourers raised up in this country. you see by this time Brother Richards I am not Idle buthave much to do & need much wisdom from God to do it well, for it is the strongestfishing ever I have done & I domt expect any thing els but while gathering the Salmon I shall getamong them some ells & snakes for their has already been sone after they would were Baptzed that wouldpitch & Bound like a porpose or jump & roll like a hen with their head cut off manifesting ev[er]y kind ofspirit but that of order & if ever an Elder had any triming to do I expect to have my share of itby & by for in doing such a rapid work as this I have to become all things to all men for Icannot get time to do much triming as yet. in fact some have before I was aware of it 
 bounded into the water to me stark naked excecpting a loose cloth around their legs but I put astop to all disorder as fast as possible. & again I am Having a mighty struggle against this [Methodist]power of falling down like a dead man stiff as a stake which is in some of the preachers as wellas the people. I have to handle all these things in wisdom. among the number that I have &are Baptzing are some large farmers having 3 or 400 acres of land I have Baptzed sone constablesas well as preachers. there is a Merchent in Hanly that we Baptzed that trade is so bad that he is winding up business & wants to go to Zion with the Saints. I have Baptzed most of his relativeshere several Brothers & Sisters here he has come down to visit them he has said sumthing tothem about it. & they all want to [trans] up business here & move with the Saints inthe U.S.A. & in fact most all the Saints are getting the same spirit here without mypreaching it. I do wish the Twelve would spedily come to England that we might hold a councilsomewhare about these & many other things. when you next write to me say a word to mewhat your mind is about this. the farmers here feel like this that bad times are coming & thesooner they can turn their property in to gold the better & in fact with the view I have of the times I cannot advise them as yet to the contrarary. you begin to see Brother Richards that I musthave much to occupy my mind at preasent considering what I have to do. & in addition tothis I have just recceved a Litter from Elder cCordon at Burslem. Stating that Elder Turley is taken with a States warrent & put into Stofford Gail, it was done by a man in Birminghamfor an old Debt that Brother Turley contracted 15 years ago before he left England, or in other wordsTurley was in partnership with a man & when they dissolved Turley gave up the stock into hishands to seell & he supposed it was all settled but now the man claims that he did notsell the stock for as much as he expeted & that he has still claims On Turley. John Jonesin Burslem was connected in taking him It is merely a trick of the Devil to stop hispreaching but I believe the Lord will overturn it for Gdod how long he will be confinedin prison I do not know. The whole Labour at the Potteries is now flung upon Elder Cordon& when he wrote me he was some out of health & should their be any faithful labourer atliberty would they not do well to go into that part of the vineyard & assist. And again in additionto this case I have a certain Brother Richards whome I love of a truth for the truths sake that dwellethin him & I pray God that it may be with him forever & he asks an interest in my prayerrs in his behalf & his companions that the Lord may manifest his will concerning them. I will nowsay Dear Brother I will gladly comply with your request the first leasure moments I canget, in fact I have attempted two or three times since I recceved your two Letters upon the subjetto lay the case before the Lord but no sooner than I would begin to pray some one would byewraping at my door for me to go & baptzed them or for sumething els. in fact since I reccevedyour letters I have had no spare time hardly to pray for any thing, for you see how things are with me & of course can judge how my time is taken up. I scarcely pass a pool of water butwhat sumbody is waiting there for me to baptze them. & in fact if John had more Baptizing todo when all Judea & Jerrusalem went unto him to be Baptzed, then I have had for a few days past hecertainly had his hands full. But do not think dear Brother that I shall close this letter with outanswering the questions you have asked me & expressing my feelings unto you No God forbid not with standing I have not had time to lay your case before the Lord as I could wish, yet I have a wordto express upon the subject. In the first place I wish to say I recceved your twoo letters & have read them overseveral times. & you speak my mind perfectly with regard to any other persons opening any of our lettersexcepting our own Qurorum. & when I gave permision for a letter to be opened should one come beforemy returned, I did not then expet to be gone but vary few days before my return & it was under the impression that if I had a letter at all during my absence it would be from BrotherClayton in Manchester, & as they wanted to hear from him I gave them that priv^i^lege with a chargeto say nothing concerning the contents if their was any thing that the church should not know 
 but being gone longer than I expected your letter arived & was opened by Brother Turley. But Ihave sent orders for no more letters to be opened that are sent to me. And with regard to thequestion you asked me on the scrap of paper. (I say yes let them eat or drink what they will in such cases)I should be pleased Brother Richards to hear from you often & give me all the news you havefrom any quarter I was pleased to hear of doors being opened in Scotland tell me whareI can direct a letter to Elder Mullenner in Scotland. also inform me of any informationyou get from any of the Twelve I wonder why they tarry so long in Americ[a] may the Lordhasten them to his country. Also inform me concerning sister Richards health from timeto time give my love to her & tell her I should be exceding glad to see her but when I shallget out of this part of the vineyard I cannot tell. pray for me Brother Richards that I may be meek& humble that I may fully overcome evry speces of pride & self wrighteousness [that] I may feelmy dependence on God in all things, & that I may know the mind of God concerning me in allthings. A word concerning you & Sister Richards. But what am I that I should teach or instructthee or inquire the will of the Lord concerning thee. O that I was more worthy that I might greantthee the desire of thy heart in this this thing & that I might more fully know the mind of God concerning myself & all things that are required at my hand that I might be more fullyprepared to greant thee thy request. But if you can receive it at my hands I say unto you thus saith the Lord let not my servant Willard Richards litely essteem his calling or station for I havecalled him & he is a chosen vessel unto me & no man shall ever do his work or take hiscrown. for he is humble & seeks my will, his afflictions shall work together for his good inthe end, let him be not weary in commtting his case unto the Lord or trusting in my n[a]me& I will bring it to pass & the darkness shall pass away & the light shall come. & I [page torn]break the bands that bind him & lib[er]ate him from those under his charge for they [page torn]not worthy & some are under condemnation for litely essteeming the priesthoo[d] [illegible]whome God has set over them. Let him still call upon me in Mighty prayer & be not wearycommitting his companions & all his ways into my hands & I will work out his deliverancein a way that I have prepared, & he shall yet have many souls as seals of his ministry, & bemighty in council, & much beloved by his brethren the Twelve. Thus Dear Brother isthe voice of the spirit concerning you & I would say to Sister Richards by way of council to trynot to be discouraged nor desire to die but to live. though your afflictions may begreat for a time yet consider what Jesus has bourn, commit all your ^ways^ unto the Lordyou will ere long enter that rest that remains for the people of God then yourmorning will be turned into joy & you will be satisfyed with the goodness of the Lord I feel as though the Lord will open a door whareby you will be liberatedbefore many days I will pray for you before God that your faith fail not & thatyou may have grace & strength according to your day. whatever is manife[s]tedunto me I will endeavour to communicate it unto you from tine totime. Write me soon Brother Richards & dont be discouraged God will be yourfriend. I should be glad to see the second No of the Tines & Seasons should youget one please send ^it^ to me at Ledbury.

RichardsDear BrotherI supposed you noticed that I did not answerany of your qustion in my last letter which you asked in March 27th the truth is Idid not have time ownly to glance it over hastily & hurry since looked it over carefully I thought I would sit down & write a few lines more to you. I remarkedto you in the last that I wished. you to come soon & labour with me awhile I did notas fully give my reason for the remark as I ought & should have done if I had room. But Iwould here remark that I did not make the request thinking that I had any power, desire, orwish to controll you. But Becaus it was the desire of my heart, & feeling that I needcouncil & assistance for much depends upon the manner the field is governed hereI want to hold several councils or conferences in this region & ordain officers inthe different Branches Besides their will be many to confirm. I have confirmed about100 & their will soon be another hundred to confirmed & I have just as muchas I can do to preach & to Baptze daily without confirming. theirfore I stand muchin need of some assistance & council in such a field. I have Baptzed about 40 preachersof the Unted Brethren primitive Methidist. [&] it has flung into my hands about 50 esstablishedplaces of preaching which are licensed including one or two chapels. & you can see at onceElder Richards that it am overwhelming labour to be upon one man. & he needs his spiritsanctified & his Body Immortal to stand such a labour & it has put me at times to mywits ends to know what to do with so many places of preachings & preachers, But according to the Bestwisdom I could get I could have pursued the following course I have finally told the preahersto continue to fill their appointments & teach righteousness & try to prepare the mindsof the people for the fulness of the gospel, but not to administer in any of the ordinances of thegospel untill I can have some help & set in order the churches & ordain such personsas God shall call. the reason I have done this is the as soon as the preachers disappoint the meeting & congregation those houses of worship will be shut up & sants might be shut outof the Kingdom that otherwise might come [in] tell me what your feelings are about sucha course. I am well aware Brother Richards their is much to do in many places Butit does appear to me that their is no field at present in England, whare your labour &council is more needed or would be of more benefit than to join me in this field aseason. I have no controll at oll over you in this matter. But should consider it a greatprivilege & favor to labour together awhile you with you. If you can set in orderyour house & leave Sister Richards a season with some friends or friend, I think youwould enjoy Bettr health here as it is entirey a farming country. Should you come willyou please remember to Bring me the first No of times & Seasons & the Book of written Revthat I left with you & if you come by the way of the Potteries will you call upon Brother WmHulme in Stoke & ask him to send to me that Little china Box a present from Brother Rowley. I have writtento Brothr Turley but had no answer as yet. if either preston, Manchester, or the potteries churchesfelt to do any thing for him as you come along you could conveigh it to tim in Stafford asyou pass though. If you can any way come soon I should be glad to see you I wonderwhy the Twelve do not come from America. I feel as though word ought to be soon sentfor 20 or 30 or a whole quorum of the Seventies for I dont see when their will be a Betteropportunity to prune England than the present. I Baptzed 13 the day that I wrote your letter 9 yesterday &many tomorrow & Sunday (Write after [1] pence a letter) If the Moon family gets ready would it not be wellto give them a Recommendation & let them go. did the three families go from preston. should yoube in Ledbury alone their is a lane neary opposite the Market house walk down that street by a tan yard 100yards & enquire for Francis Pullen his wife is a Member. I am sorry about Brothr Mullener I wondrwhat is the Matter of him whether he is under any transgressing or whether it is the devil desireing to destroyhis usefullness I am inclined to believe the Latter let us pray for him that he may be supported untillsome Elders come [that] one go to his assistance I think of writing him a letter to day as I have not yetI am now leaving all confirming for another time & shall appont meetings for [that] purpose &I pray God that you may be with me to assist me in it. It is strange that none of us hear from America I have not herd from my family for about 6 months. It seems that Abisah & Abiram inPreston begins to think that Moses takes to much upon himself but they must be careful that they dontburn their fingers give my Best Respects to Sistr Richards let not her courage fail, [Rememebrre]me to all SaintsI am ever yours in the Love of GodW Woodruff

Now ifBro Pratt has any Millenial Stars on hand, I wish hewould send us 250 as quick as possible and if hehas not any ^that^ he would print some without delay—& I wouldrecommend, with the approbati[o]n of Bro Woodruff, that 100 copiesof each No be carefuly laid aside for the benefit of the Quorum [at]the end of the release. There are regular carriers passingBro Kingtons weekly—from manchester, if you could find their officeI think you might send the papers cheaper - by them. please [d]o letus know when the next paper is going to press.I do hope some means will be devised to offod these paper for 6 pence [Yours] &.

 No 40 North Richmond St. EdinhOct. 29th 40Dear Brethren Woodruff & SmithYours of thisweek came to hand this morning I was highlypleased with the news with the exceptionof the loss which Elder Woodruff has sustainedwith him I feel to mourn for it brought forciblyto my mind the death of my little daughter LydiaSister Woodruff must feel disconsolate I cannot butsympathise with her as she is now left entirelyalone. It is cheering to hear of the prosperity of Nauvoo. It forcibly reminds me of the vision ofEsdras in which he suddenly saw a woman in greattrouble weeping with great lamentation but sud-denly there appe^a^red in her stead a great city. It willnot take the Jews long to build Jerusalem at thatrate. I think that the sin of laziness & indolencewill not be imputed to the saints much longerfor they seem to build cities with almost as much dex-terity as children build cob houses & I presume they are 
 far better. the South west of Iowa is a handyplace place for the fur company & those who dealin bear skins & sweet oil. I think the ravenswill get fat & turkey buzzards have a sociablefeast before many thousand moons wax new & old.Success to the emigrants & to the south west ex-ploring company.

You must excuse myfooleries for when one has not much newshe dislikes sending an empty letter. I baptizedseven last evening which makes 61 in this branchI have received no letters from any of the brethrensince conference. Er Taylor's letters in the"Manx Liberal" are superlative Methodist Priests stand no chance at all. You tell me Parleyhas returned I am happy ^to^ hear of it I should nothave thought however that the news would havecome by way of London. that is like the Newyorkers getting the latest news from Liverpoolvia N.

 round is ^frequently^ the quickest way of conveyance in thisday of wonders. Give my respects to Ers Taylor &Clark & tell them that I have received the paperthey forwarded & have heard of their success by theway of London give me all the news you get fromthe Isle of man & also from Manchester give myrespects to Parley also.
