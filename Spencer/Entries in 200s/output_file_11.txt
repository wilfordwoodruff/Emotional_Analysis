We feel great difficulty in making out the history of Joseph during the last three or four days of his life; many statements are entirely opposed to each other; for instance, Sister Taylor says that Sister Hyrum Smith and herself got a man who was living at W prison to their wives and children; this was signed by Sister Hyrum Smith, Sister Taylor &amp;c &amp;c, but when presented to Emma she utterly refused to sign it.

Nearly all the laboring men of this city and county as far as Big Cottonwood turned out during this month to finish the canal, or a channel through it so as to bring ^the water from^ Big Cottonwood to this city to save our crops and gardens. President Young has been upon the canal a good deal for 3 weeks past. The embankments have broken out several times; but said water has now been brought as far as Big Kanyon Creek and is watering the 10 and 5 acre lots; this is saving many hundreds of acres of grain which were drying up for the want of moisture: I don't think the water in question will be brought to this city this season. Our crops would never have been better if water had been abundant; many acres are irrecoverably lost for want of it; but on the whole we shall have a good harvest.

We are still laboring upon that part of the History, and we almost daily get new statements from men who were directly or indirectly connected with the scenes of the last four days of the lives of the Prophet and Patriarch, and many of these accounts are in direct opposition to each other. We have the statement of W. W. Phelps,  W and others in connexion with D find they conflict a good deal.
