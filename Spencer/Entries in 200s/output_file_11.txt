I learned that Dr. Isaacson one of my Jewish brethren has Joined the church, and is engaged in translating the book of Mormon in the Jewish language.

I have heard of the letter, and have an idea of its contents from my brother to whom it was sent, in Salt Lake City; but I have not seen it yet, as he forgot to bring it when he came out.  If I understand rightly you ask what is the amount of my indebtedness, what interest I have to pay, and also what aid my family will require if I go to the Sandwich Islands and leave them.  If, when I receive your letter, I see anything else that requires an answer, I will write again. My Father will be in the city about the 3rd of Jan., and he will try to see you, when he can give you all inform- ation you may require. Were he not coming I would try to come and see you my self.  During the month of Jan. I expect to take out a loan of $600.00 from Zion's Benefit Building Society to pay the amount due on my home in the 17th Ward besides this I will ^be^ owing $150.00. The dues and interest on the former, amount to $7.00 per month, and the interest on the latter to $12.00 per annum, or a total of $8.00 per month. The County, Territorial, and City taxes amount to $17.00 per annum, making a grand total of $113.00 per year. ENDENTRY Montpelier Oct 13th 1887. President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Bro.

I desire with all my heart to magni- fy the Holy Priesthood with which I have been  honored.  I regret to say, however, that my financial condition is not such as is desirable—though in the face of the history of Zion's Missionaries, their sacrifices etc for the gospel it is not for me even if I desired so to do, to say that it forms an insuperable barrier to my going from  home whenever I may be called.  Allow me briefly to explain my position.  Three years ago when I came home from the Islands I had nothing. I went to school one year, got married the next year, and went to teaching, being obliged to run in debt for a home, which debt I hoped to be able to clear in about three years from now. My income is about $70000 per annum, realized entirely from my labors.  When I go my wife will be thrown on her own resources for the support of herself and child (we now have two children). At present I do not see how she is to ^do^ this, nor how I am to raise money to take me to the field of labor mentioned (in summit Co. there is a missionary fund for this purpose) Of course I realize that God can provide. With a repeated assurance that when the Lord calls I hope to be ever will- ing, if not prepared, to respond and a prayer that God may bless those who rule in Zion, and all her interests, I subscribe myself—etc."  To the above the following answer was received:  "Elder Marvin E. Pack,  Dear Brother:  Your letter under date of April 18th came to hand and was read before the First Council of Seventies.  I am directed to inform you that you are excused from taking a mission.  Salt Lake City   May 2, 1888.

Wilford Woodruff  Dear Bro-  You will pardon me for trespassing upon your time, but appreciating your former personal friendship and wishing to obtain from you an endorsement of my action I write you. For a number of years I have been suffering from scrotal hernia. It has grown worse, until it has reached that condition that I cannot move about much without great pain, and it has become necessary that I do something by way of treatment. In order to raise the means, I have prepared a lecture entitled "Which shall it be, the philosophy of Christ or the Sophistry of the infidel? It is prepared for the especial purpose of meeting the arguments of Robt G. Ingersoll, which I learn are becoming more or less popular with some of our young peo- ple. I have delivered the lecture here in Ogden, and it receivd the endorsement of Pres. Shurtliff and others. I have been requested to repeat it.  If you wish it, I would be pleased to submit a reading of it to you at your convenience.

Bro. Bernhisel, Dear sir,  We are writing to Elders John Taylor upon the subject of the Church History.  We now ask a favor at your hand, viz. that you will meet in joint council with brothers Taylor and Smith, and assist them in making out a precise account of what took place in jail and in going to Carthage andc. We feel that it is due Joseph Smith and the Church and Kingdom of God, and to all future generations that we embody every act and word in the History of the last days of the Prophet, and we have no way to obtain them only by application to Elder John Taylor, and yourself, in connection with one or two other individuals who were with Joseph and Hyrum during their last days. We feel great difficulty in making out the history of Joseph during the last three or four days of his life; many statements are entirely opposed to each other; for instance, Sister Taylor says that Sister Hyrum Smith and herself got a man who was living at Wm Marks's to draw up a petition to the Governor to restore those men in prison to their wives and children; this was signed by Sister Hyrum Smith, Sister Taylor andc andc, but when presented to Emma she utterly refused to sign it. On the other hand Wm Clayton says he was sent for by Emma when he was listening to Govr Ford's speech, and wrote out the petition himself at her request, and that she was the first to sign it.  The petition was presented to the Governor as soon as he had done speaking; he read it, looked down to the floor in silence, and did not look at any one of the petitioners, but finally said, "I will do what I can," and walked off.  Do you know anything of this matter?  This period of Joseph's History is the most difficult to make out as Dr. Richards wrote but little, and that in detached sentences, expecting to make it out ENDENTRY Our company were Americans, English, Irish, Welsh, Scotch, and Scandinavians.  As we passed thro. Iowa many of our company left us to live with the Gentiles. Our handcarts were of a very poor kind some of the axels almost wore thro' before we arrived at Florence.  We arrived on the Banks of Missouri River August 11th and crossed the river same day on the steamboat^ferry^boat Nebraska. Several of our company considering the journey too tedious left our company at Florence. When we started for the plains our company was reduced to about 425 souls, another wagon was given to our com- pany to haul provisions as we were short of team, also about 4 yoke of cattle.  We left the little Pappea on the 18th of August in good spirits, for G. S. Lake. We travelled along very well till the 3rd of September, when more than one half of our cattle stampeded We were then under the necessity of yoking up some wild Arkansas cows and travelling the best we could. We made pretty good headway till we arrived at the upper crossing of the Platte. Many of our men now began to get weak, some had died, this made the duties of the camp to fall on a few and began to weaken the rugged and the strong. ENDENTRY G. S. L. City Feb. 28 1857  Elders Rich Dear Brethren,  The weather for the past few days has been mild and warm, snow disappearing rapidly.  The prospects for the agriculturist this season are good. Mountains heavily covered with snow, the soil deeply moistened with the snow which has lain all winter but has now dissolved; and the Big cottonwood canal in many palaces places nearly finished, which will bring the along the farming lands and into the city.  The Board of the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have again commenced their meetings and in this weeks paper have published a list of premiums; the awards are much higher this year which it is presumed will have a good effect on the Manufacturing interests of our Territory. The Bishops are getting their wards together which are generally organized into branch societies, and in some instances calling upon the people to contribute their rings, Jewels, watches andc. to send to the States to buy sheep.  Feb. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the Islands was called off, to which it is anticipated more will be added, there was also read a list of names called to accompany Prests.

Elders Rich, Dear Brethren,  I have understood that you were both expecting to come to this city this spring. I write to say that we would like to have you bring with you Indigo seed sufficient to sow one or two acres, if you could attend to it; also some madder seed, as we wish to introduce it into the Territory.  I would also like if you could obtain some Cotton seed for us, we would like to obtain sufficient to sow five acres; and if the Chinese potatoes, as advertised in Wm R. Prince and Co's catalogue, of Flushing, New York, has got into your country, try to bring a few of them, if it is not more than one or two. I wish you would try to bring us a few of Hovey's Seedling Strawberries, as they are counted about the best for producing I received a few Black Prince Strawberries sent me by— Bro Wm E. Dodge, but they are reported by Mr Prince, as being unproductive.  Any good cuttings of apples or any kind of fruit that you can bring with you will be acceptable, and any expence that you are at in procuring any kind of  seeds or cuttings we will make good. I received a small bottle of cuttings, the fore part of winter from Brother Rich which I shall take great pains to preserve.  Please bear these things in mind.  I think if a Dozen or two of Hovey's Seedling Strawberries were put into a little box or can, with a little ENDENTRY chalk, alum, and I think he believes there is salt peter on the islands.  As to what bro. Brown mentions as having been received from Springville I know nothing only what is therein stated. If you can manufacture Gunpowder and send Prest. Young a specimen it would be valued highly.  Your account of the cotton district is very encouraging; many have been sanguine that cotton could be raised on the virgin and that there were some fertile spots on the clara and the virgin which would raise southern productions.  Should the Iron roll out half as fast as your letters talks of and the cotton country produces according to your anticipations this inland Territory is insured of ^enviable^ commercial independence.  Your description of the effects of the Reformation pleases me; and I can endorse its truth in my experience in this portion of the Territory.  We have considerable sugar cane growing here and anticipate it will meture in this climate.  Many are cultivating the castor oil bean and the Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has sent us some Binney the seed of which produces the bush or stalk from which is manufactured the pure sweet oil.  There is going to be an excellent crop of fruit here this  season.

We issued 1 lb of flour to each adult and 8 ozs. to each child per day. About 8 miles west of Laramie we issued flour as follows 14 ozs. to each man; 12 ozs to each woman; 8 ozs to each child; and 4 ozs to each infant per day.  At Independence ^Rock^ we reduced the rations again Men 10 1/2 ozs flour; women 9 ozs; children 6 ozs; and infants 3 ozs per day.  We issued the last of our flour out at the 5th crossing of the Willie, purchased some hardbread at Fort Laramie this we had on hand on the 19th of October we met Bros. J. A. Young and two other bretheren informing us that G. D. Grant, and the "Relief Train" was near at hand. This inspired our company with fresh spirits that day we travelled about 16 miles with weary teams and hungry people at our next camping place we buried nine persons.  The Relief Train came to our assistance on the 21st of Oct. with provisions and clothing and bedding and shoes. W. H. Kimball and others with six wagons returned with us. G. D.

I wish to inform you and Brother Pratt and friends that we have Lost our worthy friend and Brother president J M Grant who died Dec 1st and was found on the forth 4th under Military honors followed by the greatest procession ever found at a funeral in this vally.  He was sick 10 days, later with the chills fever, turned to the Billious then the Lung fever. Nothing seem to relieve him from the time He was first taken. He had a great vision two days before His death may things were shown him in the spirit world. He has preached in the Reformation in this City and Territory as though he knew He had but few days to live. He has lifted up his voice like the trump of an Angel and cryed long and Loud to the people to Repent and live their Religion. I preume he was welcomed the other side of the Vail. See the 40 No for the News for particulars.  The last Hand cart train cane in last Sunday 1st Dec. the weather was vary cold thermometer standing 10 degres below zero some days on the road. some freeze their hands and feet their has been some 300 or 400 teams sent out first and last this season to help in the Emigration and some more than 100 tons of flour sent out of this city to the Relief of the Emigration the a part of them went nearly to platt to push up the Hand cart companies.

Yours of May 21st. has been received, and I have had much pleasure and gratification in its perusal.  I passed it over to Prest. Young from whose clerk T. D. Brown, I received the accompanying slip for you.  Last evening I had your letter read to the Board of Directors of the D. A. and M. Society; all who have heard your letter read rejoice in the spirit of it, and are glad there are some in Utah whose efforts and genius are bent on making Gunpowder. It is no doubt well known to you that Gunpowder is one of the most desirable articles that could be manufactured in this community, and one which demands our strictest attention, and deepest researches.  As to the reports of the discovery of Salt peter in abundance on Salt Lake islands, it has arisen probably from Captn. Dan  Jones' discoveries. He has discovered, slate ENDENTRY himself, but died before doing it. Now any assistance you can render to Geor A. Smith in sending us an account of those things that we may make a correct history will be thankfully received and highly prized. The sooner this can be attended to the better, as we shall have to wait this information before we can continue the History.  As to the news of the day we have not much of interest. The drouth has been great and but little water. Nearly all the laboring men of this city and county as far as Big Cottonwood turned out during this month to finish the canal, or a channel through it so as to bring ^the water from^ Big Cottonwood to this city to save our crops and gardens. President Young has been upon the canal a good deal for 3 weeks past. The embankments have broken out several times; but said water has now been brought as far as Big Kanyon Creek and is watering the 10 and 5 acre lots; this is saving many hundreds of acres of grain which were drying up for the want of moisture: I don't think the water in question will be brought to this city this season. Our crops would never have been better if water had been abundant; many acres are irrecoverably lost for want of it; but on the whole we shall have a good harvest. Some are already cutting barley and even wheat. The scarcity of bread has been very great, but it will now soon be harvest.  We have found an almost inexhaustible Lead mine; Nathaniel V. Jones will take charge of it, and is preparing men and teams to go there in order to dig the ore, run it into pigs, and bring it to this city. ^might^ The ore will yield 90 per cent of pure lead, which will enable him to offer it in this city, if in large contracts, at $10 per cart. He has travelled the vein for 70 miles, and Bror Jones says it is the greatest vein of mineral discovered in the world, and that he could sink a shaft 1000 feet without being troubled with water. It is 35 miles from Los Vegas and about 500 from this city. ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, July 11, 1888.  Elder Frankloin D. Richards,  Dear Brother:  Enclosed please find correspondence from Brother James Dwyer, addressed to myself, and also a copy of a letter addressed by him to Lippincott and Co., and the reply to the same which they sent, concerning an article for Chambers Encyclopedia, upon Mormons and Mormonism.  It is very pleasing to notice the inter- est that Brother Dwyer has taken in this matter, as it is of the utmost importance that a work with so extensive a circulation as Chambers' Encyclopedia should have a truthful article upion us and our religion, if it be possible to get the same in- serted therein. The utmost care should be taken in preparing such an article, and this comes appropriately within your province and duties. Brother Jaques, no doubt, will be glad to assist you, or any of the brethren whom you may call upon, to get it up in the best literary style, so as to compare favorably with articles upon other subjects. We should be careful not to make it objectionable on account of any deficiency in literary merit.  I shall advise Brother Dwyer that I have referred this subject to you.

From this time on wagons continued to come to our assistance with clo- thing, ^and^ provisions. From the time we left Fort Bridger we had about 50 wagons assisting us on to the valley. We buried 68 souls of the "Fourth handcart co" between Iowa City and G. S. L. City. The names of all the Bretheren I am not acquainted with that came to our assistance but suffice to say the most of them were on hand and kind to the sick and feeble altho some few were very attentive to the fair sex.

As to News with us, I can only say we have had the most snow we have ever had in the mountains and vallies. 8 feet of snow has fallen in this city this winter: it has been nearly 3 ft deep in our streets for a month. On the Island it has been about 3 ft: all the stock has been brought from  there, and a good many from the North, and driven south, and to Rush Valley, where they are doing well. We have not lost so much stock, as last year, although the snow has been deeper, but more pains have been taken to save it.  We have had the California Mail regular, but no Eastern Mail for 3 Months.  The Mail for the East started in the early part of January, but when they got to the top of the little mountain they met such a vast body of snow, and one carrier froze to death (not a Mormon) they returned.  It has been a general time of health this winter, but very few deaths.  The Legislature adjourned to this city, and we held it here; It was the best Legislative Assembly we have ever held in Utah, we had at least more of the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost with us than in any former assembly, and I believe we have not committed treason unless it was in a resolution that was passed, and that was, that both Houses should unitedly repent of their sins and be baptized for the remission of them, and adjourned for half a day, when the whole assembly went to the font and were baptised and confirmed by the laying on of hands; and I believe every man did ENDENTRY Historians Office G S L City Jan 7, 1857  Dear Bro Geo.

Mr. Gerrish arrived on the 19th, inst. from the States, reports that an Eastern mail was at the last crossing of the Platte on the way here, but when it would be here he did not know, he was some 15 days from Bridger, there is more snow in the mountains than we have ever known since we settled these vallies. Judge Phelps reports 8 feet of snow fallen in this city up to the 24th Jan. and it has lain in our streets between 2 and 3 feet deep for weeks, the snow is reported 3 feet on the Island, and all the Horses cattle and sheep have been brought to this city, also from the West of Jordan, and taken South, some fed in yards, some taken to Rush valley, where they have wintered well, the great amount of snow in the mountains and vallies will thoroughly soak the earth this Spring, there was but little fall wheat put in, in consequence of the earth being a heap of dry dust, and all the strength of teams employed in the mountains after the Emigration, but what was put in has sprouted and grown two or three inches under the snow. Our Mail for the Eastern States for Jan. was sent out, and the party got to the top of the first mountain, one of them (not a Mormon) was froze to death, and they returned. We get the California mail monthly, although the last mail, they had to go through a great deal of snow. Fillmore was nearly snowed under, quite a number of the roofs of houses have fallen in with the weight of snow.

Prst. Geog. A. Smith,  Dear Sir,  I am writing to Prst. J. M. Bernhisel  requesting them to sit down in council with you to make out an account  of the death of Hyrum Smith and the circumstances relating  thereto. From the labor you have already had upon that part of the  History you are acquainted with the difficulties connected with it. We are still laboring upon that part of the History, and we almost daily get new statements from men who were directly or indirectly connected with the scenes of the last four days of the lives of the Prophet and Patriarch, and many of these accounts are in direct opposition to each other. We have the statement of W. W. Phelps,  D. B. Huntington and others in connexion with Dr. Richards' Journal lying before us, and find they conflict a good deal. We have forwarded to Elder Taylor the copy of Dr. Richards' Journal in detached sentences, of the account of the interview which Joseph had with Governor Carthage Jail, which I wan him in connexion with yourself to fill up.  I hope Pres Smith you will lose no time in attending to this matter, as the History must in a measure remain open until we can get your answer, we with you to question brothers Taylor and Bernhisel upon every past point that you deem necessary for the his tory, and forward to us immediately. It will still be a great deal of labor to prepare this part of the History for the press, and I deem it very essential to get every word and action of them or on as far as we can embody them in the history during the last days of their lives. I am now spending most of my time in the office. My health is not very good since my sickness. I still feel the effects of it in my system. ENDENTRY 4 (9)  Sec. 13.

The day before I parted with you at the mouth of the canyon I assisted in skining an ox which died suddenly and by so doing I became inoculated with poison and mortification and it has proved to be the Hardest attack against my life of any thing that I ever put through. I was not confined to my bed untill one week from the time I left you, in 24 hours after it commenced to work upon my system as well as my Arm. I could not stand, or speak plain. president Young came Down and laid hands upon me and said I should not Die but live. Elder Thomas Bullock and others administered to me all promised me life, and I have lived and saved my Arm but I have had a 3 weeks struggle for it, my Arm mortifyed and the Dead flesh I had cut out, and cut out with Nitrat of Silver, and I am again enjoying quite good health and my arm nearly Healed up but In consequence of this I have not done much in the Historians Office up to this date, but I am now calculating to Devote my time there.

The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have regular weekly meetings, and are exerting their powers to being out the talent, skill, and ingenuity of our Territory to be exhibited at their fair in  the fall. We anticipate a splendid display of Home Manufactures; Prest. Hunter is sanguine in the anticipation of a cattle show equal to those held in the East. The Ladies are manifesting a commendable spirit and believe that in their department this exhibition will not be behind. I understand the Leather Manufacturers are calculating on supplying the States with the valley tan, if we may judge from their late representations.  You will receive a Programme for the 4th July from the Post Office; there are to be great doings.

Brothers Campbell, and Song desire to be kindly remembered to you; they are all well.  for Wilford Woodruff Thomas Bullock Clerk ENDENTRY We will forward you a hand bill headed "tremendous excitment" concerning the mail due here towards the last of May. When it did arrive (on the 4th June) there were only 26 bags out of 29 for this place which they started with from Independence; and to crown all the missing bags contained all the letters except 44; for the clerk at Independence told Leonard  I. Smith, who was on his way here from his mission to the Cape of Good Hope, that he had made up from five to ten thousand letters for this Territory within a day or two of the departure of the mail in question. This is as singularly mysterious as it is provoking, and demands a prompt and searching investigation by the Department. Can you set the machinery a-going?  Mrs. Bernhisel wished me to say to you that if you sent any draft to Mr. Poulter it is with the lost mail, and you would have to send another.  Mrs. B. was at my house to day, and all was well with her; she does not get flour enough from the Mill to supply her family with bread. I supply her with what flour she lacks; this is very strange, as the neigbors inform me that brother Houtz is almost continually selling flour, which makes me think there is something wrong in his management of your affairs in that Mill; according to the last bill I sent you from him there was some $70 worth of flour your due, admitting that all the bills he brought against you were correct.  The Presidency are all well; Presidents Kimball have been absent a few days to the Island; they went over on the new boat which was filled up for sailing.  It is a general time of health.

This act might be construed into treason, inasmuch as God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, Repentance and Baptism for the remission of sins is very unpopular in a National, State, or Territorial capacity, in the present generation.  We have had a great reformation here this winter.  Prest. Young has given a great deal of instruction, which has been of great service to the Twelve, and all the people.  The Tabernacle has been crowded to excess this winter, and hundreds could not get in.  Prest Young has not been able to attend at the Tabernacle since the burial of J. M. Grant, until Sunday 1st inst, when he spoke about one hour and a half, to the great joy of the people.  Bro Kimball has preached for several Sabbaths past with great plainness. F. D. Richards and myself were the only ones of the Twelve here in the city fall, and we organized the Missionaries and went through the city in every ward preaching the reformation We attended a meeting almost every night for 3 months.  Elders L. Snow have been with us during the sitting of the Legislature. O. Hyde has gone South.  We  have had a glorious winter, the spirit and power of God and the Apostleship has rested upon us in power, and the vision of our minds has been opened to see the state and position of this people, and we have felt like rising up and magnifying our callings.  The School Houses have been crowded to excess, and there has been a great deal of good teaching given to the people this winter.

Our Legislature closed on the 16th, Jan. we have had the best Session ever held in this Territory, done up all the business right, and were of one heart and one mind, and do not think that we have committed treason in only one thing, and that was in passing an act that the whole Legislature should repent of their sins, and be baptized for the remission of them, and adjourned for half a day and repaired to the font and were all baptized and confirmed and I believe every one received the Holy Ghost, this might be construed into treason as the Lord the Holy Ghost, baptism and repentance are all very unpopular throughout the world in a Legislative capacity, yet I do not think that it could legally be made out to be treason either by the constitution or laws of the United States, organic act, or laws of this country, yet Congress may disannul the act, all except the receiving of the Holy Ghost that the members have received and it cannot be taken from them if they do their duty.  As touching the Historian office, I will say that we have not done much during the sitting of the Legislature, but we are at it again, on the 30th. the Presidency sat and heard the history read up to the organization of the church in Nauvoo, 8th day of August 1844; also President Young's life up to the same date. we have wrote a short sketch of the life of each of his brothers, also bro.
