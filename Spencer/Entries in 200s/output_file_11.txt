Brothr Amison    I Received a letter from you  under Date of Jan 9th & a few words from Eldr Smith  on the 10th I have not had time to answer you  before this, we have just Received a package of  6 letters one or two from Eldr Smith who Informs  us that Eldr Turley had arived in Nauvoo & that  Eldr Mullener had arved in New Orleans I was truly  glad to hear of their arival. We Rejoice to hear  of the progress of the work in all parts of the land  & I am Happy to inform you that the  Lord is begining to Bless us here in London. We  have Baptized 36 & many othrs at the water  Doctor Copeland & an Independant Minister  are among the number Baptized. Our little  Room is almost getting full of Saints without  the World & as the place is begining to be to  strait for us we are trying to get a chapel or  larger house so that we may dwell. Eldr  Kimball has also organized a small Branch  of 6 members in Woolwich, he Baptized 4  the first time he preached there, & the seed  sown is Bringing forth fruit & they are trying  to open a door in that place also, & Eldr  Wm Pitt is Baptizing some at Ipswich  & so if the Lord will enable us to build  up a kind of a Zion in London & have  some stakes around about it we shall be glad  there is begining to be much inquiring 
 in London at the present time & may the  Lord roll on his work. I am glad to hear  of the steady progress of the work in  the Potteries, But I am always sorry to  hear of the poverty of the Saints & that they  have a ha[r]d time to get along. I wa[n]t  you to give my best respects to Sistr Amiso[n]   Brothr & Sister Wittaker Brothr & Sister Player &  family, Sister Eliza Bromley, Broter & Sistrr Ridge  & all the Saints at Lane End, & at all othr  places that you see.

Remember me to them all in Stoke &  Hanley, Burslem, Tunstall, New Castle & all about  Eldr Kimball Also wishes to be remembered to  you & all above mentioned. I shall probably   spend the winter here in London & visit all the  churches in March through Herefordshire, Staffordshire &  on to Manchester so I trust I shall see you  then if not before.    I want to write a  few lines to Eldr G. A. Smith on the following  page so I must bid you farewell for the  present. Let us never be weary in well doing,  but hold out faithful unto the end, that we  may receeve a Celestial Glory.    Yours in the Love of God    W. Woodruff    Thomas Amison

 Paris Henry County Tenn 11th Dec 183-    Brother Asahel. H. Woodruff. Honor.d Sir    Having Some leasure time  amid the Multiplicity of business, I concluded to appr[o]priate  A portion of it in writing to you 1st ly I would inform you  that I receieved your letter under Date of Sept 9th 1835  & I esteemed ^it^ a great pleasur[e] once more to read from your  pen & hear from you. You remarked their was some chanc[e]  of your visiting Tenn" or Paris I never more desired An  interview with you & the rest of my relatives than of late  & when I first come to this country I expected to hav[e]  seen them ere this But there has been more & more  resting upon me ever since I first set my foot into this  country I have enjoyed the best of health since I have  been in this country for which I feel thankful to God  their has been much sickness in this country for late  season frost it as at precant hath I feel that Nothing  But the goodness of God both preserved my health for I have  been exposed to all we^a^ther–& travled at at times wet or  dry cold or hot. I have travled on hors back since I have  been in this country my circuit if circuit it might be calle[d]  is about 130 miles in length which I travel through in every  two weeks my meetings generally are as often as every day &  sometimes oftener Brother Warren Parrish Left me & w[[ent  to Kirtland Ohio the 23rd. of July since I have been alone  untill A few days since Elder. Elias. F Wells called on me &  I think will Labour with me awhile however he has left me  now in per[s]uit of his hors which was stolen or let out to stray  on the night of the 8th of Dec while we wer holding a meeting  in the court house in Paris if he finds his horse he will travel  with me I have many waters to cross in my travels & it  is freequently the case after rains that I cannot cross them  without swiming my horse & at one time in attempting to swim  Bloody River the stream being rapid my horse got into  difficulty among the brush &c. I was obliged to Leeve my  hors & swim out by myself however we both got out unharmed    I have been much opposed by the  Priests of the day in this south country as is the case with all  all the Elders whare ever they travel if they preach the gospel  in truth & purity they have generally worked behind my  Back more than to my face some few however have public  opposed me face to face such I have publicly answered &  not in one instance has the Lord suffered me to be confounded  we have Baptized 115 persons on my circuit 24 I have  Baptized since Elder W Parish left & I still have more  calls on the right & left than I can attend to & the [stand]  rolls & the Kingdom grows whether it is observed or not  & it will will continue to grow whether untill Christ comes 
 You remarked that if you was expecting A letter  from Brother Azmon I should be pleased to have  you write to me from time to time while I ame  here & should you do so give me the news from  Brother Azmon & his family & our Parents or any other friends  that you should hear from. I have not herd from Brother  Azmon (except a few words from Mother) since I left Liberty, Mo.  Brother Azmon has much changed his religious principles  since I saw & left him what they now are I know not  I receieve a letter while at Missouri from him stating that  he had Left the Church of Latter Day Saints & advised me  to do so. I do not exactly se[e] through his object or meaning  I have nothing against Brother Azmon I wish him well  Soul & Body & all his family I parted with them all in  peace & do not know that he has any thing against me  I left all my property in his hands & gave him power  of Atturney to make use of my name in selling resting  &C. that our creditors might be paid & satisfied I have had no  evil intention in leeving that country I did not run away  nor go away secretly all my neighbours in Richland knew it  I laboured hard before I left & settled with all in that ^country^ or nearly  so except our friends in Connecticut & one would naturally  suppose that $2,000 dollars worth of property out to pay $5.00  [do]llars of debts I am perfectly willing that Br Azmon &  every other man should enjoy his own opinion as to religious  subjects or any other. When Brother Azmon Joined the Church  of Latter Day Saints he was vary strong in the cause in  Believing the Book of Mormon & bearing testimony to the  truth of it & professed to receiev great blessings which I  do not doubt But as respects myself I cannot leeve the  Church & Cause which I have espoused No I to[o] highly prise  those Eternal & Immortal glories to sacrafice them for the  the things of this world which will perish with there using No  Brother Asahel the Church of Latter Day Saints is not a fiction  I have had somthing of a chance to know I have travled  about 1,000 miles with the Prophet & Seer of the Church I have  attended the conferences & been acquainted with the first   Elders of the Church I have herd their teachings & beheld the  the spirit they were of & the gifts & graces which Christ said  should follow the believer (or Signs) are manifest in the  Church for what a person has experianced he knows I have  been made partaker of some of the blessings myself such  as the gifts of healing Tongues & interpetations of tongues for  which I feell to thank God (not wishing to bo^a^st) but acknowledge  that every good & perfect gift cometh from God which is the  same yesterday to day & forever & his Gospel gifts & graces the same  & the same causes produces the same affects to day as Anciently

But as I feel a great interest for your prosperyts [prosperity]  Salvation & Eternal interest of all my relatives I wish you  would read the Messenger & Advocate the paper published at  Kirtland Ohio inasmuch as you have time & opportunity by that  you will in some degree have if a chance of investigating the  subject.

So with man al^s^o—he spake by faith in the name of God, and the   sun stood still, the moon obeyed, mountains removed, prisons fell, lions mouths were closed,  the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence, armies their power, the sword its terror,  and death its dominion, and all this by reason of the faith which was in them. Had it not be[en] [page torn]  for the faith which was in man, they might have spoken to the sun, the moon, the mo [page torn]  prisons, lions, the human heart, fire, armies, the sword, or to death in vain. This is th[e] fait[h] [page torn]  the Ancient saints. Now look around upon the religions of the day with all their mishionai[ries]  and societies bible societies tract societies sundy school unions and printing esstablishments  &c &c. yea go through all the sects in christendom which have been striving for power  during the last fifty years like so many ferocious beasts and whare will you find a man  of God whare can you find a servent of the Lord who can prevail by prayer and faith  and unstop the bottles of heaven in a droth whare will you find a mighty man that can  chase a thousand or two put ten thousand to flight. Whare will you find a man that  can say to a Dorcas In the name Jesus of Nazareth arise—and have her spirit return  and she again live Not among the catholies, not among the episcopalians, not amon[g]  the presbyterians, not among the quakers, not among the baptist, not methodists not  christians nor campbellites nor universalist no not among sect any sect for they have  ownly a form of godliness and deny the power thereof. In fact the faith of the Church  of Christ of latter day saints has not ben sufficient amid such a world of unbelief  to perform many great miracles The sick have been healed & speaking and interpeting  other tongues are common but thanks be to God if the Church continues to go from  grace to grace and from faith to faith it will soon lack no good gift and as the  Lord is the same in time and in eternity yesterday to day & forever if we as saints  are pure before him what Enoch saw we can see what Moses did we can do what   Peter had we can have what the saints endured, we can endure and what  the righteous receieve we shall receieve. Glorious prospect What Joy to come O I wan[t]  a world of words—a univers of praise & an eternity of gratitude to thank the Lord for  what he has done and will do for those who love and serve him faithfully unto the end  I want the earth deluged in prayer the heavens lit with songs and eternity filled with  Praise. We plough not the ocean for wealth we visit not foreign climes for gold we  risk not our lives among all manner of men for fame:—no the servents of Jesus Christ  go whithersoever he commands them to carry glad tidings to proclaim salvation to all  that will accept fit according to the conditions of the gospel that the kingdom of heaven  ^[2 illegibles words]^ may come: yea the joyful day be usherd in when Israel shall be gatherd from the  four quarters of the earth to meet their Redeemer and have their ungodliness turn[ed]  away [FIGURE] [brd] [FIGURE] O that the Gentiles were wise that they understood this that they  would consider their latter end. the Bridegroom is at the door yea the signs are puttin[g]  [illegible] in the heavens and earth of the second advent of Chris[t] which will appear in thi[s]  generation O Brother for Jesus Christ ^sake^ open your eyes and see and understand wha[t]  you read it is a day of warning and not many words for as it was in the days of Noah  it will be when Christ comes he most assuredly will overtake this world as a thief in  the night so that no man take thy crown.

 Canaan July 9th. 1837    Dear Willford    Haveing just returned from meeting with  brother Smith and wife where I was expecting to see you as brother  Smith was expecting you and brother Hale to be there I learned that  you was gone to Farmington and wished to know when I arrived  in the this place I would just say that I got here (to brother Smith's)  yesterday about noon. had a good passage was out ten days. was detained  on the way 2 days. came alone from Buffalo. brother [Wed] and wife  came as far as there with me. I received your kind letters the Sabbath  after they were written by the hand of brother Gribble and the contents  [page torn]isted me much without it I should not have been able to have come  [page torn] as I was dis-appointed in selling those skins all but 3 which  brother Redfield to and paid me six dolls. I should have answered  your letter immediately but was expecting to come immediately and  therefore thought it unecessary as I though I should get here nearly  as soon as a letter but I was detained many days longer than I expected  to be. There was something ^said^ by some of the brethren about your returning  to this place again before we went to Maine but they could not realy  tell what therefore I am calculateing to start next saturday for  Farmington if you think of comeing come before that time if you  can. The brethren ^are^ anxious to have me stop and make a visit  which I [havecluded] have concluded to do so as to rest myself  as I was much fatigued when I arrived here. br Give my respects  to brother Hale and tell him that his family are well but his wife  did not write by me for want of time but sends a message by  me to him which I will deliver when I see him. I do not 
 mention particulars as I hope soon to see you and can then  tell you more than I could write at present as I am in great  haste and am writing almost upon the run so as to mail  my letter to night. I did not have to do as I told you I  was intended to when I arrived here for sister Smith knew  me at the first sight. all the brethren and sisters are verry  kind indeed. Brother Joseph Smith has been verry sick  but is recovering now.    I remain yours affectionately as ever  P. W. C. Woodruff    N. B. Dont let any one see this for such looking letter for  I am in great haste and have a bad pen and no Willford to  mend it. so I must bid you good eve, and fold  my letter and take another journey before I see you  I expect.    ^HUDSON^    Should you write a line direct  it to Norfolk Post office 
 Mr. Willford Woodruff  Farmington  Hartford County  Connecticut    Norfolk Ct)  July 10th)    [Wilford Woodruff] Phebe W. Woodruff  July 9th 1837 
 Scarborough  Aug. 5th. 1837    Dear Willford    I have sent to the Office a number of times since you left here  hopeing and almost fearing that I should receive a line from you. I say fearing  lest it would say that you was not about returning as I have been pleaseing  myselfe with the I idea that I should soon see you again although I have felt  anxious even to hear from. If you reco^l^lect you mentioned not writing if your  stay was short–but let me say that your epistle came to hand last eve and  met with a pleasing reception. I perused its contents and was truly rejoiced  to hear of your good health and spirits likewise of your prosperity in the cause  of Christ and that the Spirit of God attended you and brother Hale and opened  the way before you booth temporally and spiritually as I felt verry anxious about  you knowing your circumstances and that your temporal meanes were verry  limited. Well we will acknowedge this to be another proof that the Lord is  not unmindful of his servants and all that put their trust in him. He is  able and will give us that which is best for us, although the way seames verry dark  before us sometimes, yet he sees fa^r^ther than we do.    After reading your letter I  [fe]lt encouraged and satisfied to have you about your masters business although  I have felt some lonely and would like much to see you and enjoy your company,  yet I think that it will be much better for us both to be in the place appointed to  us by God, if it is to be separated a while than to be elsewhere.    Willford I per-  cieve that the day is at hand when the salvation of souls and a seat in the celestial  kingdom of God will be of more value than the shining ore which many spend their  whole time and talents in persuite of in this life– therefore I hope that you will  ever be diligent in keeping the commands of God and in dischargeing your duty fai-  thfully to this gene[r]ation that you may be the sooner discharged from your warfare  and be permited to dwell (with one in whose affections you share largely) in peace  and with the approbation of heaven saying "I have fought the good fight I have finised  my course I have kept the faith" &c&. If we seek first the kingdon of heaven we have the  promis of all things being added to us–yet my heart will sometime distrust providence  I then take a review of the dealings of God towards me and the promises left on reco-  rd for those who keep the commands of God. this stimulates me to diligence and  persevereance and to try to endure to the end and then obtain a crown which  I trust is laid up for me if faithful. I find it to be rather hard liveing here spir-  itually as there is much darkness and opposition in these regions but my faith is as  strong in the gospel of Christ as ever and I think if I keep close to the rod of iron 
 I shall get through. It is a verry darke time here now–it appeares as though  every ones heart is closely shut against the truth in this place and H. Harmond  is as bus^i^y as a bee in the summer in putting down mormonism as he calls it  he says he is determined to put it down–Yet I rejoice that the hearts of some are  open to receive the truth even on the Islands of the sea and pray the Father of Heaven  that you may have many souls as seales of your ministry. Believe me Willford I  have not forgotten you or brother Hale once ^since you left^ when alone before God but asked him  to open the hearts of the people to administer to your temporal wants and give you  access to their hearts that you ^might^ speak the words of life to them and receive it. I am  pleased with brother Hales prosperity as it is some ^thing^ more new to him to travel and  pr^e^ach than for you. brother Willy said before I left Kirtland that he would not  hold one meeting alone this summer, thus we see that he was mistaken and I rejoice  in it. I think that he will make a mighty man for God if faithful.    You mentioned something about letters comeing to the Office for you I have taken out two  one from Mother Woodruff bearing date of Aug. 22 – and one from Asahel H. Woodruff  from Terrahaut bearing date of July 23rd. directed to you in Farmington, it was taken  out there and then remailed and then remailed and sent to Scarborough. Mother Woodruff  mentions the reception of your letter–the bank note and the bowl of bread and milk  w^i^ths with which you was favoured on a day of your journey–thinks the promis not  made void that as thy day thy strength shall be says that the health of her family is  good or that hers is not quite as good as when we was there. she says that she was about  to write to Aunt Coyssett when verry unexpectedly Betsey came into the house and  her mother soon followed her. says they came away in haste hopeing to see you  again–says it was her intention to have been baptized had you been there. Mother  told her she was in hopes to see you again this fall. she has written to Azmonds'  family and to Asahel and say's her sheet was well filled she gave the particulars of  your visit with them and the reception you met with among your relat^i^ves. she says  that she wrote something to Azmond and Elisabeth by request of sister Coysett  the substa purport was this, that from an interview with you she believed you  to be right and engaged in a glorious work. and Uncle Ezra was much di^s^appoint  ed in not seeing you and hearing your discourse at uncle Adner's as he did not hear  of it before it was to late. Mrs. Alling called on her (Mother) recently she said that  her mind and heart was open in view of this subject. Uncle Ozem has lost a child  of late. As her letter was lengthy I have just given you a few items and preserve  the original for your perusal when you return. also of Asahel's he mentions the 
 reception of your of your letter dated at Farmington and makes many friendly remarks  upon the subjects of friendship connections mormonisn &c&c. We have received a paper of  late from Kirtland–there was not particular news in it accepting that the inhabitants of the  Citty far West had chosen 2 Judges 14 Justices of peace and established a post Office.  Therefore I fear that your letter will get lost by the Office being in another place. I  finished that letter which you commenced to Sarah and Aphia the next sabbath and  sent it. Tell brother Hale that there was a letter came to the Office for him a day or two  after he left here. I will now forward it to him[e] with this. The health of our family is  good with the acception of Mother's and I think her much better than when you left, she  wishes to be remembered to you. I have been quite unwell one day and night of late  but have far recovered. sister Shuah's school closes this week and sister Rhoda expe-  cts to be change her situat^i^on in life next month. brother Fabyan and wife send their  best respects to you likewise allof the family. You said that you felt easey about me  well I am receiving every kindness that my fathers house can afford. I have been spend  ing some time with sister Foss she wants to see you much. Brother Toronsen works just  above there–he called on us Sabbath afternoon and spent the eve with us–we had a little prayer  meeting which seamed quite encourageing. I feal that I am almost alone spiritually therefore  I hope that you and brother Hale will continue to pray for me for I feal that I nead the  prayes of all who have access to the t^h^rone of grace–You shall have mine. When the eve twilight  comes Phebe wishes that she could see and converse with you for a few moments at least, but  she cannot at present–she can retire in private and ask the Father to keep and presere you  and give you wisdom knowledge understanding and strength equal to your day. I hope that  you will be faithful and that all the people on the Island will be wise in time to secure  their salvation. Was I near you I should like much to go to meeting with you occasionally.  You requested me not to send any letters to brother ^H.^ if they come to this oOffice after the 15th. of this  month and that you should come in about 2 months are you expecting to stay longer  than he does. I recollect those pebbles–children are pleased with something new. I have not  learned styrography yet–but am waiting for you to come and learn me. Write often for I [illegible]like  to receive a line from you any time. I am expecting to go to Portland tomorrow to spend a  few days. Give my best respects to brother Hale and accept a large share of them  yourself. I haste to close as the clock has just struck 11 and retire to rest.    May the peace of God ever rest upon you is the sincere desire of your Phebe    Phebe W. Woodruff –    Excuse mistakes for I perceive  them verry frequent while reviewin  this

 88 Bowery Street New York Oct 23d 1839    Dear Phebe    Notwithstanding we are at times flung into the deepest suspens in  consequence of not hearing from our dearest friends for a season yet I rejo-  ice that the day comes when we understand the cause of all & our minds are  unloded of its burthen. As it has been with you so it has bean with me  in one respect: I have looked with feelings of the deepest interest for a letter  from my Dear Wife (in whose bosom my heart has a resting place) but I had looked  in vain untill I began to think that I should no more hear from my Phebe &  Sarah untill I left the Shores of America But thank the Lord my great suspens  & fears (for great they were) are now removed. yesterday after spending several hours with  Brother Ilus in his Store (who is well & in good spirits) I went to the post Office  as I have done almost every Day or sent. I again called for a letter & to my great  joy I recieved one from you with a few lines from Elder Smoot under  Date of Sept 19th 1839. I wrote you a letter at Springfield Ill 20 of Aug paid  the postage on it & requested you to write to Buffalo Ny. Farmington Ct &  City of New york. I am sorry you did not obtain that letter for I gave a [sheet]  account of my travels the way the Lord put means in our hands. my preaching &  visit among the Island Saints I visited the grave of Brother Brown. the resignation of Sister Brown  was great the whole church sent their respects to you. I also wrote a letter to you on  the 30th of Sept at Farmington ct Eunice also wrote I also gave you a brief account  of my travels in that letter & paid the postage on the same I am in hop^e^s you will get  that letter I perceieve that those letters that are post paid are more liable to miscary  than those that are not so I will not pay the postage on this letter & I pray the Lord  that it may fall into your hands. As regards your Situation in Sickness I truly  feel to sympathize with you & Sarah, your situation has been shone me I have had  several interviews with you since I left home & I have been aware that you  was in affliction. but your patience & resignation in your trials as great conso  lation to me & I can still have confidence my Dear companion to invite  you even in your Deepest trials to leam upon the arm of that God who has  upheld you untill the present day we can do no better than to trust in him  whether in life or Death. the Saints all seem to be much afflicted this season  But may the Lord have mercey upon us all I pray & not take our lives from  the Earth but that we may be humble & finally have a victory over the destroyer  but even should we die some of us it would be in one of the best of causes  & we should sleep but a short time before we should be awoke & meet together  in a glory Celestial to part no more whare sickness & sorrow is known no  more But yet I expect to enjoy Blessings with you & Sarah in the family  circle though I thus speak, I truly felt sorry to hear of your & Sarah's sickness but  I feel thankful that you have any friends that are able & willing to render you 
 any assistance in your afflictions & I pray the Lord to Bless Br & Sister Smoot  & Jemima & all the Saints in Lovely Street for all their kindness towards you  in your afflictions & Sickness that has or may come upon you I will remem  ber you & Sarah with them before God in my prayers. Phebe I have a great  deel I want to say to you in this lietter. As far as my health is concerned it has  been vary unsettled I had but one chill after I left home which was [next]  day for about 4 weeks I took however some of Sapingtons pills which  stoped my chills & fever & I had no more untill I arived at Buffalo with the  exception of a light chill in Germontown Wane County Ia which was brought  upon me by preaching & sitting down by a window & the wind blew upon me &  I was chilled Br Taylor followed me though he was very feeble in the first stag[e]  of the Billious fever I have not roon to tell you much about it for I suppose  he hath written to Sister Taylor before this time & informed her of it. I was oblieged  to leave him in Germontown but It was with a family of the kindest people. but  as I was feble Brother Taylor wished me to continued my journess & he would tary  untill he got well he was vary Sick 2 weaks & the fever left him low & it took two  weeks more to recover his health I have not seen him since but am expeting him  in this City every day. My chills returned as I took the canal Boat in Albay in  consequence of being in a storm on lake Erie & taking cold I had a chill Evey day  for 8 days but they were light, & soon as I arived at fathers my chills stoped for  several days & then returned for several days. On the 27th day of Sept my Grandmot[her]  Thompson Died aged 84 years. Also on the 4th day of Oct Uncle Adna Hart died aged  43 years both of Avon I was called upon to preach the funeral Sermon of  Adna Hart & the town was set at the time my chills was upon me but I  attended the funeral preached to the people & had no chills or fever during the  day nor but vary little Since. I left Fathers the 7th of Oct & arived at New york  next morning at the Store of Brother Ilus F Carter I have called upon him  freequently Since I have been in the City I reiceved a letter from Sister Foss  from the Hand of Ilus in answer to the one that I wrote her from Terre Haute on  the 25 Aug. I have visited the Church at Sing sing & Brooklin since I arived in this city  & I find among them as well as though this City many Mothers & Sisters that feel & act  as though they could not do enough for me they spare no pains to make me comforta-  ble & happy & to supply all my wants your petitions are fully answered in this respect I  mean your written petition that I foud in my trunk which I have after read  with great satisfaction. I am glad indeed that you wrote me when you did for  I am now expecting to take water for Liverpool the forepart of the comeing week  probably on Monday in company with Elders Mullener & Wright & Brother  Taylor if he arives before we leave. & as to the rest of the Twelve I know no  more about one of them thatn if they were in another world I do not know  whether they are in Montrose, Commerce, or whether they are on their Journey 
 I cannot hear a word from one of then from any source whatever. I was sorry  that I was not privileged with a few words in your letter upon the subject as I  was so long on the way myself I expected to have found then all in New york  if they had not left for England. but I have waited & delayed the time untill  it is begining to be cold weather & as I am some out of health I feel it my  duty to cross as soon as possible & I am in hopes to see the Twelve in England  if I do not see them before give my respect to any of them that you may see or  any of the Sanits [Saints] that enquire after me esspecially Brother & Sister Smoot, Jemina,  Brother Hawley & family (tell them I called upon their Brother in Rochester Mr Satley &  found him vary believing) & all Saints in Lovely Street or els whare I cannot  name them. With regard to the putting on of flamnel a Sister has this day given  me a nice cotten shirt & is preparing flannel underbodies & drawers for me out  of her store. but I must stop speaking of those small things & say a few words  concerning the great work of God. I Baptized cousin Betsey Cossett in Farmington,  the work of God is spreading wider & wider in this City & in the countrys around  about Elder Ball & perhaps some others have done injury in this City & cou-  ntry by running from church to church & doing those things that are not according  to the order of God but yet the work of God rolls om this Nation begins to feel the  chastning hand of God fire & pestilence has almost desolated some places [Mobele]  for instance: such fires [are] so numerous was Never known in these last days as  now, this City has suffered much lately by fires. & in addition to this the Bank [page torn]  charts are like troubled waters, & the Jews are rapidly flowing into Jerrusale[m] [page torn]  letter has just arived in this City to a Jew from a Jew in palestine stating among  many other interesting things that their is now Standing in Palestine & Jerrusa-  lem 1,44000 Jews & they are constantly gathering. H A R K!!! & I will tell you  some news which will counteract a part of this letter. P.P. Pratt has just arived in this  city with his family. I have just had am interview with him. We now expet  Orson Pratt & Br Taylor & some others every Day, & we now expect to tarry in this  city untill they come & perhaps others of the Twelve & we shall hold others of the a  conference here before we take our departure for England which will of course  delay our passage for a while. I am glad Br pratt arived before I mailed this letter  I may write you again just before I leave New york. Phebe if you do not  recieve letters from me often enough or in their Season do not think it my  fault but attribute it to the Mails which are uncertain, for you may rest assured I  shall not forget you but will write often & I hope you will be able to do so by me  I have had no opportunity as yet to send with any safety those things to you that we spoke  of prarley has brought a package from you to Ilus. parley & family are well I must did [bid]  to a close & leave out many things I would like to say. But be of good cheer trust  in God I feel that he will bring us all through May the Lord bless & heal you & Sarah  & all the afflicted Saints for christ Sake Amen    phebe    your friend Willford 
 [sideways text] A O. Smoot I thank you for writing a few lines to me I was glad to hear of those  things of which you spoke I should be glad to write more lengthy to you  but excuse me at this time I feel vary thankful to you for the kindne[ss]  you & Margarett have shown my family render then what assista[n]ce  you can in their afflictions & you shall not loose your reward  the fields are ripe in this City & country for a great work, though the  Saints are deeply afflicted in the west yet God will save & bring them  out of it if they do his will.

 New Egypt, New Jersey, Nov 24th 1839    My Dear Phebe    I once more sit down to write a letter to you, this is the  fourth letter I have written you since we last parted, but whether you get  my letters or not I do not know know. I have not recieved but one letter  from you but I was truly thankful to hear from you once, and I have  been sorry that I did not request you to write immediately to New York  as soon as you recievied my letter under date of 23rd of Oct, I could  then have had another letter by this time but I would now say, that I wish  you would write to me as soon as you get this & direct it to me at  New York City & I may get it before I leave for England. I will write  you again before I leave the City & tell you whare to direct to me in  England. I feel more ankxious to hear from you & Sarah because of your  sickness. I wrote a letter to Brother Luther Scamnon's & Sister Foss a short  time since. I recieved a letter from Sister Eunice a few days since  the friends all well Mother's health good. I see Ilus freequently he is  well. When you write me give me an account of the sickness in Mont-  rose & Commerce name ^those^ that have died since you last wrote if any there  are, tell me (all about it) how you & Sarah get along in your Sickness  give me any sick bed reflections or meditations that you may have  had, & give me all information you have concerning the presidency  or Twelve or any of the church whether they are sick or well, tell me why the  paper is not printed & sent to the subscribers, are the Editors still sick. On  the 2nd of Nov I wrote a letter to N. Thomas Rochester Ill, & on the 9th Oct to Milton  Holmes. On the night of the 8th of Nov I saw you in a dream & thought you was  still in affliction but did not see Sarah Emma & on the 11th I also had an interview  with you & did not see little Sarah…. I also saw the same night S. Ridgdon  E. Higby, & David Patten. Tell me when you wright how you get along with your  temporal matters, what is your condition are you in want of food or help, how  do you get along with the cow, shall I send you a few dollars in money I will  try to do so next letter, & while I am making enquiries concerning you I  expect you wish to hear sumthing concerning me how I get along &c; I  shall say nothing concerning my travels &c. before the date of my last  letter for I hope you have recieved it before this time. I took a severe cold  a few days after I last wrote & it settled upon my longues & I had a dreadful cough  for several days & it left me. I had the last chill & fever on the 26th day of Oct. On  the 1st day of Nov I accompanied three Elder viz Clark, Wright, & S. Mullener on board  the Ship Tarolinta, capt Smith bound for Liverpool, they took steerage passage & looked quite  comfortable fare $12 & find themselves & after committing those Dear Saints of God  into his care, I took the parting hand with them, may the Lord go with them  & bless them I pray. Nov 5th I went to long Island & for the first time since  I left you I was able in body to take a regular course of preaching I preached  every other night & three times on the Sabbath. & on the 13th Elder O. Pratt came down  to the Island & joined me in labour before we left, we had large congregations  we left many believing & their was rising of 30 baptized by other Elders when we went  there, the last meeting we held, the friends gave us a collection of $25 dollars to  assist us in our travels. We returned to New York on the 18th inst, & on the 19th  We held a conference in the City, P. & O. Pratt, W. Woodruff S. James, B, Winchester  S. Brown & a number of other Elders were present, & after sitting in conference 
 ^The following Page is for your Private perusal^  Phebe I know you have made sacrafices, & great ones to, you have made  them for Jesus Christ & his cause, & you have made them for me: some of  them have been of such a nature that it hath required all the powers of the  soul to pass through them, & those sacrifces still continue, even our seperation  is required for a season in order to do the will of God, but I think you are  sensible that no worldly honour or Earthly gain would cause this our seperation  No nothing but the commandment of God. Notwithstanding the gate is strait  & the way is narrow O! do not shun it, walk in it, yes walk in it for my sake, & seek  not death, but livie, yes live for me. Our sorrows, our trials, our sacrafices soon  will end, & in that rest that remains for the people of God thou shalt be comforted.  Stand by me & maintain thine integrity untill we enter those glories that are  to be revealed at the comeing of Christ & thy joy shall be full. O! the glories of  a celestial Kingdom I long for thee, for thee I pay my sacrafice. O! kind hearer  seal my prayer, grant my request, give me an enterence with my rib my child  within thy gates, & glorify our souls with Eternal light & truth & united pow-  ers inseperable. Ah Phebe I have had to much of a taste of those Eternal &  Almighty truths appertaining to the Celestial Kingdom of God, to let go my grasp  I have put my hand to the plough I cannot look back, I must  finish my work that My father hath given me to do, & I have confidence  to believe that I shall have your assistance unto the End. I know I have  my imperfections, & it is with a degree of sorrow that I reflect upon some  past hours of my life that I might have spent to better advantage & more to  the happiness of myself & others, but my determination is to spend the future  according to the best light the Lord giveth me, [loft] me up by your prayers and  confidence you have mine. I will try to prevail with the hear [page damaged]  your behalf that the Lord may comfort & heal you & support yo[u] [page damaged] On  the deepest wounds of affliction & sorrow & enable you to be res [page damaged]  to the will of God in all things, & wait patiently for my return. Should it  be our lot to enjoy a long Eternity together in that society whare tears are  wiped from all faces & sorrow & sighing are known no more, we should  not regret having passed through trials here in the flesh. All the ancient  Saints & Jesus Christ not excepted had their trials to pass through but they  are now glorified, & as it is now our turn & we are living in this last dispensat  ion & have a great work to do, then should we not act nobly, walk by faith &  do our work in patience untill we can say it is finished. We are not alone  in this great cause, the Heavens are deeply interested in our welfare, our  cause, & our work. It is true we have a great warfare to accomplish in order to over-  come, the power of the enemy is greater than some suppose. It has already required  God with the armies of heaven to wage war with him that Satan might be cast  down with his influence. If so then we have strong powers [to] contend with  but with the assistance of God we likewise will overcome. I feel not at  all discouraged my way is onward. I am detemined to run the race (by the help of God)  that I may win the prize for myself & family. When I meditate upon the dealings  of providence with us both since our connexion, the manner in which  he has delivered us from the power of the Enemy, & saved us from the jaws of  Death, & supported us in the midst of trials of the keenest nature, I still feel  disposed to trust in his name, rely upon his word & [seorve] serve him unto  the end. O! may the Lord bless thee, comfort & support thy soul untill thou art  perfected in Christ Jesus; (do not fail to write me as soon as you get this, tell me all the news. are  you in your new house & comfortable. has Sister Taylor herd from Brother Taylor if so whare is he, give my respets to her  But while all nature is wraped in midnight darkness I lay down my pen & retire to rest & think of thee. Good night Phebe    Willford    I enclose $1 dollar in this sheet will send more next time

 Jan" 29th 1840. At Alfred Cordon's, Club buildings, Navigation road, Burslem, Staffordshire, England.    My Dear Phebe    While seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusal  May grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORD  JESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter  when I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival  But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my  voyage & travels since I left New York to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839  in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular  packet ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &  moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.  She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making  109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most all  on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale at  night, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & as  rough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet  above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on  deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo  rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fair  winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black  fish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-  culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This  with the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing waves  made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is  not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for one  is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thick  together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along  rough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days  we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breeze  sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her  with great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.  5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deck  viewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number  of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at  sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat  from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-  ing the St George's channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining our  eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20  days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish  coast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light  houses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side  ^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. We  reached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a pilot  on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not  yet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she left  New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time  that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]ated  before the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be  unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not  sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steam  Boat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood  thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed  & fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few  minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance should  all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxford  but so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first time  I began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the   most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of which  were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever saw  The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson's  Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain  around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.  Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly covered  with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though  there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much  Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil-  -ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are  far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their  buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole  hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the air  is vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding  England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to  Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it vary  singular to hear the Rector's, & Curit's preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion without  having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at  Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing  has attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poor  male & female, their cloth may be equ⬦ally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear  as tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit  their dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a  pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be  taken from the ship & go to the custom Hou⬦se & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and   rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &  papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars    run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The cars  run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once  more behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con  versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from the  the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should  think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in  Preston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool &  Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & Willford  Woodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will go  to Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york  & is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley and  Clark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.  Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton  manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother  to visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 men  to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of  Jesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]  & composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]ed  the devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the day  I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th  Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England  the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were  healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach  & road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred Corden  This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most  of the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon  he went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a  week for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of  66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saints  have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their  teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God is  that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day last  for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have began  to preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine  & keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecution  does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &  occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followed  me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]  congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found  it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will  go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the  potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd the  word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making  Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inha  bitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments part  of the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country  &c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern  country. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land  Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London   so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in  the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford's bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity   of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in   angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over   & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands  of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the  government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to  to protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel   war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets begging  Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of   Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting   what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress  & it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go  through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.  for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort  the Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it   requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the present  time & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth   more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I   believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol   places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth   to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto   them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to   preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily  that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the   Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man   came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-  ism unveiled W Parish's letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed   the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him   to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury  I answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were   afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come   out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but   you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vine  yard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you   by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved   but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or   8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary   anxious to hear from you & Sarah Emma & also about the Church around you, perhaps you may  have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want   you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things   with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between   Missouri & Ioway, tell all the news of a National character, I herd New Orleans was destroyed by   the Mississppi River is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & Commerce   tell me all about it. are they publishing the times & Seasons. give my respects to all the friend[s]  in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity. Elder T[aylor]  [page torn]    sent a letter home [to] [page torn] his family a few days since in Commerce. I expect Elder Taylor h[as] [page torn]   written to his family by this time. Remember me to all of our friends unto who you [illegible] [page torn]  write. I shall not have time to send many as lengthy letters as this to America, but I shall endea  vour to give you an account of all important matters with me. & I hope you will write to   [page torn] [m]e a[s] often as you can convene[i]ntly please drect your next letter [to] Mr Willford Woodruff   in care of Alfred Cordon ^Club Buildings^ Navigation road at Mr Godwin's works, Burslem, Staffordshire England. It is a long direc^t^ion  I know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to New York or it will not come  but if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y.   also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it   I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing  of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you may  obtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in   your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn]   according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in   the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we may  enter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited   the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom  whare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun   shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit   down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke   of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give   me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git  a large sheet & fill it full. I want to know about the sickness & who is dead. & what Joseph & Sidney done at Washington  & what the prospect is concerning the Church & its progress in America. What news have you from our friends  in Maine remember me to all of Father Carters family when you write. I do not know that you will be able to  read all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter & not lose it as I shall wish  to see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to  labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through & again meet with my family  But my Dear Friend & Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation  for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ  & warn the people of this generation, & prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-    [page torn] [-pai]red for the coming of the Son of Man. & if we are faithful in this great work, & do the will of Jesus Christ & are   wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended & the victory won, then how  sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward & how Eternal our happiness. & May the Lord   Jesus Christ intercede for us, & all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he   comes we may be like him & reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen    I remain forever your Companion & Friend    Willford Woodruff    Phebe W.

 Montrose Lee County April 1st 1840    Beloved Willford    I have just sent a letter to the office for you but  as another oppo[r]tunity offers itself I avail myselfe of the same in writing  to you, thinking you would like to know how I and my little ones get along,  today our little Willford is 10 days old and I have been out of doors, and sit up  the most of the time and feal to render praise and thanksgiving to my  heavenly father for all his loveing kindness to me through by life, but more  particularly of late through my late confinement. You (probably with   many others woho have called to see me) would say be careful and not  take cold or sit up to long at first, I have tried to do so. Our little Will  ford is a verry bright looking child with dark eyes his hair almost exactly  the colour of yours. Sarah E. is as bright as ever and highly delighted with  the babe. I often think how pleased you would be to see him and how  happy we might be with our little family if you could be at home with  us–may the Lord grant that it may soon be the case. Was I surroun  ded by thousands I should in one sense be like the lonely dove that mourns  her absent mate, who from hill, to hill, from vale, to vale, her sorrows doth  relate. As my babe lay seeping sweetly on my arm thes^e^ words came to my mind  I write them just as they come to my mind.    Sleep sweet babe and take thy rest,  For God looks down and will the[e] bless,  With all that's good, in earth, or heaven,               If thou wilt keep the commandments eleven.    Sister Smoot desires the addition of Owen   to our babe's name. I think that I  shall have quite a present for you when you return if we are spared  all of us to see each other. I have lately received a letter from Maine, Father  Mother and sister Foss wrote in it, they they much desire a visit from you when  you return, could you not take a ship bound for Portland instead of N.Y.   and pass two or three days there, they all much regretted my not comeing  home and passing the time of your absence with them. Father tells me if I   am ever in want to come to his house where I shall find an asylum – sister   Foss wants you to take Ichabod if you come that way – Mother says that she  expects to loose Shuah soon – brother Ilus is married – sister Mary failes  more and more. I have not heard from father Woodruff's family since you left.  I heard that Sarah Milliken was expecting to be married to a man out of the   church and likewise intemperate the sisters about here, wished me to write to her  on the subject I did, mentioning sister Eliza Grants case to her but have received no    I forgot that I told you about Shuah and Ilus in the forepart of my letter as I have been  sometime writing it. Will. is laying looking at  me as I write in my lap 
 answer – dont know but that she was offended with me for my plainness, but could  not well help it, for I felt interested in her wellfare as we have been so intimately  acquainted. I told you in my other letter that I had been liveing by the wayside  as it were since you left me, I have moved 4 times since you, left home; that is   something for one whose health was as feeble as mine. I moved from Montrose  to brother Smoots, thence to my new house then to father Clarke's then into a small  house of his in the same door yard, just before I was confined–I chose to   go there that I might be more retired. I had every thing at that time that  was necessary to make me comfortable and have been much blest of the Lord.  I missed you much more at that time than before Oh! thought I if I  could but have my Willford to call on instead of strangers what a comfort  it would be to me but that time is past and over now, thank the Lord for it.  Your prayer was answered in my haveing friends to stand by me when I needed  them – the brethren are verry kind about here likewise the family where I now  live. I shall probably stay where I am untill you return – father Clark says  that you need not be concerned about ^me^ untill you get back only pray for me,  he is verry kind.    Have you forgotten our hour for prayer, we have the third  one to join us – sister Foss in Maine – she tries to observe the time & although  far distant from each other we have the same God to call on, woh who hears  the prayer of his children. We know not how to appreciate blessings untill  we are deprived of them. We often see people who are permitted to live togather  men to stay at home with their families but me thinks they do not realize  their privileges. I often look on such families around me and think how happy  they must be but I suppose they do not realize it, I even look on black Jack and   think if I could have my Willford live at home ^with^ me even if we had to work  verry hard I should not mind or value that for then we might enjoy our  humble pittance ^in^ each other's society which gives a relish to every blessing. You prob-  ably remember our last ride togather out to brother Hawley's settlement to see our  little Sarah, the prairies were most delightfuly clothed with flowers and   verdure and I thought it the most pleasent ride we ever had togather, the sabbath  following I rode out to the same place in company with a number of others  to a meeting and to see Sarah the flowers were there but they with every thing  else were dressed in gloom and looked lonely as I felt, nothing looked cheerful  but my little Sarah, I found her health much improved which was   much satisfaction to me – these with many other reflections pass and repass  through my mind – but in the midst of them something whispers Phebe  do you want your companion to come home to you before he has filled his pres-  ent mission my heart answers no but Lord give me patience and a willingness to   wait his return and hasten the time that he shall be returned to the bosom of his 
 family after haveing filled [hit] [misn] thy love and fear which may God grant for Chris[ts]  sake.    It seames to be my turn now to write to you mostly now as this is   the third letter I have written you since I received any from you. I feal verry  anxious to hear from you to know how you prosper in that country–hope you will  tell me all about it when you write. In my last letter to you I gave you an acc-  ount of my sickness likewise somethings concerning the church as correctly as I could get   them, liveing at a distance from the body of the church but shall now leave it princip  ally for the bearer of this (brother Orson Hyde) as he as more of an opportunity to  know correctly about church business than myself. The pre sent present prospect is   that Congress will do nothing for our Church now as a letter from Washington has  lately been received bearing that I inteligence–brother H. will probably give you  the particulars concerning it and all other church affairs I suppose. Brother  Hawley has got back to his place again–brother Petty is expected back from Tenn  esse every day now–brother Murphy has been here from that place and wishes to be rem  embered to you he said he used to be acquainted with you and had quite a curiosity  t to see your wilefe wife which I perceive is characterestic of all your southern  friends, I suppose they think that I am a curiosity. I must give way for your son  to write some to you. (O papa come home and see me. W.) now Sarah wants to writ[e]  some to pa to. (O pa pa come home and se me and baby S.) Thus you see your [page torn]  have written to you in their childlike state, Sarah cryed to write more.    I had like to have forgotten to tell you that brother Ilus is married to Miss M.  Sloan and Mother says she expects to loose Shuah soon. We have lately  heard that brother Willard Richards and wife was expected here soon. One of  Morris Phelpse's girls live with me now about 12 years old. Please give my   respects to brother Taylor and all of the quorum who are there, likewise all  of the saints there. I should like much to go and see them. The sick  ness has abated although many have the chills yet. I have had a num  ber since my confinement but am better of them now–want to kn-  ow how your health is–want to see you verry much. Ah! my dear  Willford hasten your mission as much as you can by being faithful in  the dicharge of your duty and come home to us–tell me in your next  when you think of comeing home I hope next autum–that looks most  like an age to me to look forward. I expect to write to morrow to sister  Carver if I am well enough. I received a letter from her a month since  but have not b^e^en able to answer it yet. brother J Herrett called to see me  a while since and says he thinks I had better have stayed in his family and   wishes to be remembered to you    I remaine as ever your true friend and companion    P. W. Woodruff    (Willford Woodruff)    [sideways text] I sppose that all of the wives of the 12 here will write by brother Hyde. I believe they are all well

Willford is 2  weeks old to day and I feal quite smart. Commerce is building up verry fast, there was  one thousand people came in yesterday some to attend the conference but the most of them to live  there. brothe Joseph Meakam has just come in and wishes to be remembered to he has got better of his  lameness. yesterday I had the satisfaction of hearing from you by receiveing a letter from you–the breth  ren and sisters many of them ask what are the news what are the news. I suppose that it will be read  to day in meeting as they have carried it acrost the river to day. brother Joseph says that he will have  4 houses built in Commerc one for sister Taylor Young Pratt & Woodruff–their families are well  Brother Hyde expects to start for [Eng]. as soon as this meeting is over  [end sideways text]    Phebe W.

 40 Ironmonger Row Saint Lukes London Feb 18th 1841     My Dear Phebe    In the midst of a multiplicity of business & care I   seat myself to once more drop a few lines to you, praying   that kind providence may direct them to fall into your hands   I have not herd from you since your letter that was dated  in New York, which I immediately answered with a large full    Mammouth sheet, Dated Jan 13th in which I copied extracts from my   Journal from July 8th 1840 to Jan 18th 1841 & spoke of all the letters which  I sent you I hope it has fallen into your hands. Their is much   I would like to say had I time & room in this sheet, but being short   of Both at this time I must be brief. I requested in you in the last   to send the next letter to my address here in London   I am sensible there has not yet been time for   one to come, But expect to see one from you   before I leave England.

A few days after your letter   came to Hand Elder Kimball received one from Sister Kimball   who informed us that Elder Turley arived in about a week after   you left, & put into her hands (all safe) all the letters &   things which I sent for you & that she had forwarded  ^some^ allof the letters to you & wrote one herself, said she would   take good care of the things ^untill^ you come. Elders Kimball   & Lorenzo Snow are sitting by my side writing we are all   well. They both send their respects to you.

 Dec 30th With regard to the progress of the Work of the Lord in   this Land it is still rolling on in all parts, & emigration   is vary great. The Saints deeply feel the forebodeings of the   awful judgments, distress war & tribulations which is coming   like a whilrwind upon every hand. On Sunday last we had   a conference in London which is the first conference we   have ever held in this Metropolis. We had an interesting time   106 Saints represented most of which have imbraced the work   of late, 46 in the London City Branch & the rest in the regions   round about, in small Branches which we have raised up of   late mostly. Their is now a fair prospect of the spread of   the work in London Elder Lorenzo Snow is appointed to   preside over & take charge of the churches & conference   which we have esstablished in London, & the Lord has given   me the desire of my heart, in seeing the work esstablished in   this city, & I now feel that I can depart ^depart^ in peace   I feel that my work is done in this Land & my testimony   finished, or will be this week & then was it not for visiting   the churches which I have built up in Herefordshire &c to   get the necessary means to return &c. it should not   be many days before I would be upon the sea, but I   must have patience iat all times & get along as fast as   I can. We are leaving our last testimony to the citizens   of London in a small tract of 8 Pages 3000 of which will be   out of press this week which we leave with our friends for circu-  lation after we are gone. Elder Kimball takes his farewell   of the city tomorrow, & goes to Birmingham Preston &   Liverpool, whare he meets Elders Young & Taylor.

I expect all the Twelve [page torn]   [Amer]ican Brethren except Elder Snow will leave for America the fir[st] [page torn]  of April, for we are in the midst of great excitement which prevails   not ownly throughout Parliament & Londom but throughout   the Nation concerning the Imprisionment of Cleod & the –  North Eastern Boundary question England now seems determined on war   & she never was better prepared than now, Her fleets & armies   will soon be spread along the American Coast, the present   signs of the times in Parliament indicate a speedy declaration of war   against the U.S. and if we can Leave Liverpool time enough to   escape it we shall do weell.

 Scarborough Mar. 27th 1841    Much Beloved Companion    It is with peculiar feelings   that I seat myself to acknowledge the reception of your kind   letter dated Jan. 13 & 18th. It afforded me much satisfaction as I had   long and anxiously been looking to hear from you—did not get your   letter written Nov. 22th. The last communication but one I received from  you was dated Oct. 31th. The last time before this I wrote you was in   Dec. after I arrived in Scarborough. I should have immediately   complyed with your request in answering your letter but it was so late  in the month when it arrived, as you thought of starting the first of April  I thought you would not be likely to get it. I though[t] I would send  you a few lines to N.Y. hopeing you will get them.    I said I sit down with peculiar feelings because I hope to be permitted  to once more behold your face not many days after you receive this. I think  you will not tarry long in N.Y. (hope so at least). When I came home we left   N.Y. one night and arrived at fathers the next, we came from Boston in the cars and   stage as the steam-boat did not run then—it was more expensive. The Portland   boat commences running tomorrow fare to Boston $2 if there is an opposition boat  it will be less. Our fare from Iowa here was some o over 40 dolls. You  spoke of your baggage box, do as you please about it. I should like to see the   things you spoke of, if it would be expensive do not bring it but if you have   any articles of clothing for me or Willy you may take them—of course you will take   what things you want yourself. i My health is not verry good this spring  Willy is well and smart. Mother sends her respects to you and says she wants 
 to see you her health is not verry good likewise all the family are enjoying   comfortable health and wish to be remembered to you.    Dear pa pa I am glad you are comeing home to see me    W. O. W.    You see our boy has got so large that he can write some  to his father before he ever see him.    I have received a letter from   mother Luce on the Island her family are well—one brother Hyde &  brother John Herrett went there and laboured a while they were both sick   and brother Herrett died I think last Oct. at brother Crocket's house  I will not write much as I hope to see you soon. Please give my  respects to those of the brethren who may come with you, likewise to brother   Ilus and wife and accept a large share yourself    Yours truly    P. W. Woodruff    I believe people are allowed to carry   one trunk or box free from expense when   they are traveling    April 6th all comfortable   well but father he has a  lame back    [upside-down text] Dear W. hason [hasten] home  P.

I shall look for a letter from you when   I arive in New York I shall call upon Brothr Ilus  & if any letters are in his possesion I can get  them. All of the American Brethren are well, &   we shall all sail together. I recived a letter a  few days since from Mothr & Sister Eunice they were   well or in Better health than they had been.    I wish to be remember to all the friends in Maine  I trust I shall see you all before long if the   Lord will, the Lord hath blessed me much & all   my Bretheren since we have been in this land for which   Blessing I feel thankful, & I now feel perfectly   satisfied to leave my fieled of labour & return   Home.

 Murray. Utah. Dec. 3, 1894.    Mr. Wilford Woodruff,  Pres. Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.  Salt Lake City.  Utah.    Dear Sir:    Recognizing that the Gos-  pel was restored to the Earth  through Joseph Smith, and that through  him also Christ's Church was organized,  does that exclude every person, not be-  longing to that Church, from the ben-  efits, blessings, and direct influence of  God, and the h^H^oly Spirit? And prior to  the time of establishing that church,  could any one have communion  with God or the Holy Spirit? Can  people who pray to God and sincerely  believe that their prayers will be  answered. – can such people, not Latter Day  Saints, expect a blessing, or any  answer to their prayers? Can they ex-  pect the manifestation of God's power  in any miraculous way? Could they  work miracles? Can the reach the  throne of him who answers prayer,  and be saved? Are their payers of   any avail? I have my opinions but  they do not harmoize with those of my   neighbor. I may not understand the  matter, but I want to and therefore I  have taken this liberty. Will you please  explain it to me.    Begging your pardon for this intrusion  upon your time.    I remain, sincerely yours.    Chas. H. Wirth.

 Nauvoo March 19th 1844    Col Solomon Copeland    Dear Sir    I take this  method to break that silence which hath prevailed  for a length of time between us And also to  make a request of you of an important nature  The following reasons are some among the many that  promps me to this course. When I was a stranger in a  strange land Advocating principles of the fulness of the–  everlasting Gospels of the Son of God Although as true as  any principle that ever emenated from the tr^h^rone of Jehovah  yet the most of all Doctrins unpopular with that  class whose minds are limited to the sectarial notions  & traditions of the present generation instead of expending  to receive the revelations of Jesus Christ which doctrine freequetly  subjected me with my friends to unfair opposstion persecution  warrents &c It was in the midst of this order of things that  I found Col Solomon Copeland among the first to step forth  as a Gentleman, friend & Republican to assist us in maint-  aning our rights & ^you^ not ownly treated me & my friends  with common civility & sociability But all of our  wants were bountifuly supplyed under your hospitable  roof. This Sir was not all I discovered that whenever any  principle was presented that was high, Noble, & glorious that  when carried out would have a tendency to ennoble  man & exhalt him to the highest grade ^degree^ of usefulness, 
 intelligence & glory that was ever designed for man by the  God of heaven that it would strike a cord & vibrate your  soul as with the rapidity of light[n]ing yea the silent Language  of which was, this is congenial with my spirit & the sentiments  of my heart. And whenever in my perigrinations I have  met with any master spirits of this kind I have marked  it in my mind & laid it up in my memory for  a future day, permit me Sir to say that inasmuch  as you are one of the most prominant ones with whi[c]h  I have met in my travels I feel disposed to express my  mind freely to you upon the subject which I have  in view. Sir Those primary principle appertaining to the  Kingdom of God & the salvation of man which we taught  in our spiritual Infancy & in which you seemed to take  a deep interest are of no less consequence now than there  in fine evry day that rolls over our heads adds to its mag-  nitude & importance for whenever any great & Noble purpose  work or plan is put into operation its light & influence  is seen & felt more & more by the Nations of the Earth  Much Sir has been said concerning us as a people, our  motives & principles have all the day long been misrepresented  by wicked & designing men. We as a people are not known in  our true light I would to God we were I would to God  that president Joseph Smith was known in his true light  to all the wise, the good, the virtuous, the meek & the hone[s]t   in heart & they would be lauded by a portion of the same spirit  that is like fire shut up in his bones He ownly kneed to be known  by men to be haled as one born out of due time to frown  upon oppession, plead the cause of the opp[r]essed, as the universal 
 friend of man, to introdu[c]e Intelligence & wisdom into the  world, To raise a standard of light & truth as a Ban[n]er  to the Nations of the Earth that time nor man canot  extinguish or destroy. He has thus far by the Help of God out-  rode the storm of persecution heaped upon him by his enemies  who have saught to take away from ^him^ evry right that the Laws  & Constitution garantee unto him as well as evry Americ[a]n  citizen, his course has been onward in the midst of evry  difficulty untill he has erected one of the largest cities of  the west ^containing a population of some 15 or 20,000 souls^ and is surrouded not ownly with the ^best^ intelligence  & wisdom of the Earth as his council but with thousands  of friends who would in a moment ^if necssary^ lay down their li^v^ves  in his defen[c]e against oppression & mobs, & as the time  has arived when we deem it no longer necessary to put  men in office to use our influence in promoting men  to the highest offices of this government who will not act for  the good of the people but for their own aggrandizement &   party purposes. And we as a people have come to the ^conclusion^ conclusion  to run a candidate for president of the United States at the  next election And that candidate is General Joseph Smith.  And sirs the request I wish to make of you is to know   if you are willing to permit us to use your name as a  candidate for vice president at the next elec^t^ion &  also to invite you to p^f^avor us with a visit at Nauvoo  I make this request of your honor according to the cou[n]cil  of the Authorities of the City of Nauvoo, and we should be Happy  to see you & you will meet with a welcome reception  in our midst & I think Sir you would Be amply 
 ^repaid^ in your feelings for taking a journey of this kind; I  trust Sir you will favor me with an answer to   this the earliest opportunity. I will forward you with this  Letter a copy of General Smith views of the powers and  policy of the gover[n]ment Un[i]ted States    With sentiments of respect I subscrib[e] myself  your Friend    Wilford Woodruff    Col Solomon Copeland    P.S. please give my respects to Mrs Copeland & all  enquiring friends Elders Smoot and Allexanders & all  the Southern Brethren with their families are well as far  as I know. I should be much pleased to have an interv[iew]  with you & esspecially to have you see General Smith you  would like him he is the master spirit of the age you  would be pleased with Nauvoo I think come & see us  if possible.

Woodruff:    Dear Bro, being notified Nov. 16th to   prepare to start on a mission to the Southern   States by Dec. 13th, '87, I returned a favourable reply,   supposing, as was the custom when applica-  tion was made, that I would be accorded the   privilege of visiting England the second   year. Learning, however, that the custom   has been stopped for obvious reasons,   I would respectfully ask, if it meet with your   approval, that my mission be changed   to England. I have to offer as a reason  for preferring this request that I have a  large number of relatives in that country   and desire to hunt up genealogies in  connection with my labors in dissem-  inating the principles of the Gospel.    awaiting an early reply, I remain    Yours Truly,    A.

 Salt Lake City, Utah, Jany 15th /1889.    Prest Woodruff and members of the Twelve Apostles:    Dear Brethren:–    On Saturday last the 12th inst, I received a copy of a con:  joint report made by two committees, one appointed by yourselves  and one by the Board of Directors of Z.C.M.I., whose duty it was to  investigate the merits of propositions to be made by me looking  to the inauguration of a company for the production and  manufacture of Sugar in this Territory.    If the Brethren had seen fit, before they made their report, to  have accorded to me even one opportunity of laying before them  in Board assembled the information correspondence and corrob-  orative evidence at my command, I would have esteemed  it as a courteous kindness to me, and a respectful apprecia-  tion of the Powers at whose instance and in whose behalf they  acted, and of the importance of the business to be discussed,  and I feel assured that the recommendation contained in  the latter part of their report would not have been made.    I thank you respectfully for having appointed said committee 
 and express my regret that the circumstances in which   you are placed render it impossible for you to extend  financial aid (which however my understanding of the position  forbade me to expect at present), nevertheless I hope that  the portion of said committee's report indicating the advisability  of a postponement to another year will not prevent your  giving moral support to myself and other friends of the  Industry who are entering upon the inauguration of the enter-  prise the present season, and if it be not asking too much  I respectfully solicit that in acting upon the report of the  committee you specify that your sympathy for and moral  support of this movement shall be accorded.    Permit me to say for myself and the brethren who are associa-  ting for the inauguration of the Industry referred to, that we  see in it (and of its success we are substantially convinced)  and the saving of the immense amount of money now expended  and the large profits that will certainly result, the gratifying  possibility of strengthening and establishing other industries  which shall be made to afford or furnish appropriate labour  to large numbers of workmen of various trades & manufactures,  many of whom are now but partially employed and that  in labour to which they have not been accustomed.    We see that there must be an advanced state of prosperity 
 for the people at large before they can avail themselves of the  superior advantages for Education which it is in your minds to  introduce, for to many thousands of our brethren in their  present condition and circumstances the proffer of these oppor-  tunities for proper and advanced Education would be as  the tempting viands placed before, but just beyond the reach of,  the mythological Tantalus. Surely to retain symmetry in  the growth of the Tree of God's planting the temporal, as well  as the spiritual, should partake of the elements of suitable  and consistent nourishment.    For the sake of the principles involved, and that the  nation may not have to answer for the gross and unwarrant-  able robbery and persecution, vastly more than for the  property in question. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will  render judgment in favor of the Church in the suits now  pending in Washington    Respectfully submitted  Your Brother in the Gospel    Arthur  Stayner 
 The 6th of January 1889    President W. Woodruff!    Dear Brother!    Your letter, as a call for me to go  on a Mission to Switzerland and  Germaney, has come to hand severall  weeks ago, and I beg your pardon for wayting  so long before I have answered.    My feelings, my wish and desire is, to  respond to the call, and I hope that no  evil Power can hinder me. I hope to  be ready and prepared to start at the  apointed date and from the apointed place.  I do not know what may happen untill  that time, it seems my Enemies has not  forgotten me; I have been absent from   home since the 8th of March 1887, and  now I have received word that my  Family has to go to Ogden to appear  before the Grand Jury as Wittnesses againts  me. I do hope, that I will not be 
 betrayed, that they can not find me,  but that I will be able to go on my Mission,  for I think I can do more good there.  If you have aney further council, or advice  to give me or aneything to writte to me,  please adress the letter to C. F. Bessler  Logan City, but leave my name out on  the Envelope alltogether, for the one in the  Post Office seeks to find out all he can,  he is non to good to oppen letters, for he  has done it. I hope and wish that  this new Year will be a happy one for  you, that the Blessings of the Lord will  be with you continuelly and no ^evil^ Power will  be able to injure you in aney way.    My best wishes and kindest  Regards to you.    Your Brother in the Gospel,    Christian Schneider.    [Thomas X. Smith] Prest Willford Woodruff    Dear Brother    I can recomend C Schneider as being  a good latter day Saint and is willing  to do all he can his circumstances is  not very good, is family is Scattered  and this makes it more dif[fic]ult to take  care of them but this can he got a   Long with if you wish him to go  on a Mission with kind regards  your Brother in the Gospel    Thomas X Smith Bp

 Georgetown Jan 9th 1889.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff    Dear Bro    I just received a call to  day from you asking my  feelings in regard to taking  a mission to New Zealand.

 Panguitch Jan 24th 1889    Prest. Willford Woodruff    Dear Brother    I notice that there are some Seventys  that are beeing seclected for missions, that  are not very well prepared to go, Both in   ability to teach and financley.    And there are a number of young  men some High Priests & some Elders,  that would make good missionaries in  the world, That I could recomend if they  are wanted. We would like to keep a few  out all the time, as the influance of a young  man returning from a mission is felt for  good in the ward where he is from.    There is a young man in the Cannonville  ward, John H Davis, that would make a good  missionary, he has broken the Edmons Law  within two years, & he is on hand if wanted in  the missionary field. Bishop William J. Henderson 
 of Cannonville Ward is in the same boat  he is a man about 50 years of age, he   is not in very good circumstances financly  what would be advisable in his ^or such^ case.    Your Brother in the Gospell    Jesse W. Crosby Jr.

 Ephraim, Feb. 26, 1889.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:–    Bro. Fredrick Jensen Holt, of Ephraim   desires to go back to Denmark as a miss-  ionary, both to preach and also to obtain  his geneology, as far as he can.    His age is sixty-four past, not much  calculated to preach. He is a widower,  two daughters, but both are married,  means very limited. He is an inoffensive  good Later-day Saint. His most ardent  desire to go back is to obtain his genology  as he is the only one of the family.  I have rather discouraged him little  and advised him to obtain ^it^ through  brethren who are already there in the   field, and that he might defray  the expenses for the same. He feels    (over) 
 that a word from you, either in   favor or against his going, would  satisfy him.    In our last talk, I promised I   would write to you on the subject.  He desires to go with the brethren that  leave after April Conference, if you  consider it allright.    Please excuse me for troubling you  with this matter.    Your Brother in the Gospel,    Canute Peterson

 Santaquin, 21 Jan. 1889.    Prest. W. Woodruff    Dear Brother,    I received your letter of  29 Dec. 1888 the day after,  calling me on a mission to  Norway, to leave Salt  Lake 9th April 1889 &c  also your favor of 20th inst.  to day, which I will try to  answer, the reason I have not  done it before is that I  waited for our Bishop to  come home from the pen.  My feelings with regard to  this call are as I stated in   my former letter, good, and  I am willing to go on the  day appointed, but I can   not see how I can get the  means. I stated in my 
 letter before, that I did not  have any money to start  the journey with, nothing  to make these winter months  and a large family. I stated  in my last that I have 2 sons  that would be a great help to the  family in my absense, if the  Lord would bless them with  health and profitable employ-  ment, but it would ^be^ unnat-  ural to expect that they could  take the whole burden and go  right along with it, and provide  for the family without mater-  ial assistance. I therefore  ask if the time could be ex-  tended a few months, which  would give me a chance to  straighten up some finan-  cially, and be better prepared  to help myself, but in case    that something should turn up in my favor  between now and April 9th  that would enable me to  go, then I will try and report  myself in time. I hate  to have to be so humble,  but it seems to be my lot.    Will you please answer  this as soon as you can and  oblige your brother in  the Gospel    O. H. Olsen    Bp George Halliday

I would therefore say that I wish to do some  work in the Temple before leaving and I will be ready  and willing to go to England any time in April next  if you wish me to go. If it is your wish that I  should go will you please notify me now as I have  to sell my team and would like to make my  arrangements accordingly hoping this will meet with  your approval    I remain Yours &c    Wm H Evans

 Vernal Uintah Co Utah  April 25th/889    President W. Woodruff    Dear Brother    In the seliction  and apointment, of one of my Boys to  take a mission to the southren States, it  wass iqually unexpected, and aperingly  damaging to my temporal calculations,  but I am greatfull to God, and Tankfull  to you, and they Brethren of the Preisthood,  that he has bin considiret worthy to be a  Maesingor of glad Tidings to the Nations  of the Earth; Notwithstanding: I am his  Father I can impartially recomend him  to be a praisworthy Boy, of good morals,  Habits and Intecgrity, devoted to serve the  Lord.    Having sead that moush of one of my  Boys, I wish to refere to a older Brother  of his, there is not far behind in the  good qualleties ascribet to the first one 
 only appiarrngly not so moush divoted  to the couse of God at present, having the  foult of so many of the Mormons Boys,  (so termed) ligtheadenes, but wel Talanted    Leeving this subject I wish to give a stat  ment of myself, or mayby more proper  ly called a confession; A few years ago  at about the time of the braking up of  some of the Settlements in Arizone;  true the influence of some of my Friends  who mouch desired to have me go there, and  to which ^t^ I consented, (being a devoty to the  Unitted Order which was then in running  order in Arizona, and wary neer totally  broke up in Utah,) they brougth abaut a  cald for me to go there, reseving a letter  from you to that afect;    I comenced to make my arangement  for the mission, when my freind Br W:  Tunbridge (who wass in Levan on a leeve)  resived a letter from the Bishop of the Ward  to where we wass going, that the Settlement    had broke up, he (Br W: Tunbridge) talked  to Bishop N Aagaard, and I talked to  them boeth, and the conclusion arived  at was: that inasmoush that the Setelment  where we wass destained to go to was broke  up, we wass on natural consequences  released. I desired though at the time  to have wrote you for informations, but  they insistid, ther wass no nessasity,  but as I have at offentimes had a remors  of consience conected with that calling  which I ded not fell. I resolve by thise  writing to relate the full particulars, for  I do not wish to shrink from any dudy,  I allso wish to state that I am in your  hand, if the Lord and his authorrety  wants me. I am here, notwithstanding  a little over 54 years. I feel healty and  strong anogh to pay a wesit to my  old Birthplace (Danmark,) thise is a  consideration I leev with my Brithren  in the Preisthood, but if ever, I pray for

President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    In response to the call with   which I have been honored  to go on a mission I feel  very grateful for the same  as I have always found  pleasure in the missionary  field I was called in  my native land (Sweden)  when a young boy and labored  as a missionary for nine years  in the Stockholm conference  untill I was realeased in 1879  to go to Zion, and I feel  the same love for the  missonery field to day.

 Add: Springville Jan. 8th 90.  Utah Co U.T.    Wilford Woodruff Esq.    Dear Sir!    The situation your Church is in, and  as you are the head of that Church; your   situation is at present extremly precarious,  I have a scheme to offer you, that would make  you and your Church triumph and gain a complete  Victory, and I garrantee that Utah would be-  come a state within five years if you manipu-  late this scheme as I will tell you. I am surpris-  ed you have not hit upon it long before now,  it is not against the principles of your faith; and  and is nothing worse than what your people voted  for in the late Constitution, yet the scheme is such  that the Gentiles can not possibly discover the trick  at all, if you but have from 25 to 50 thousand of   your people you can depend upon; that would do  as you tell them, when you first get to hear it you  will be extremely glad as it will save you from de-  struction and disgrace, and would cause all of your 
 people have unbounded confidence in yourself,  and it would bring tens of thousands of people  into your Church, because they would think you in-  spired indeed, and it would be worth untold milli-  ons of dollars into the Church treasury.    This is not overdrawn as you yourself knows that  if Utah became a State, that such would be the  prestige you would have, that the above would  result; and if you but will carry out my scheme,  Utah is bound to be a state in a few years at  most. I have no possible interest in your  Church, as I look upon it as a fraud "from the   word go." but if you will pay me handsomely,  say: $200,000 00/100 I will tell you said scheme,  if you do not act upon this you have better   make up your mind to: that your Church will  go to destruction because of the failures of Smiths  Prophesies, but if Utah becomes a state those  failures will be forgotten.    But if you conclude to undertake this scheme  it must be kept absolutely secret, exept to  those initiated, if it becomes public it will  fail. If you a⬦ accept my offier I am willing 
 for you to bind me as tight in writing as you  like, but one fifth must be paid down before   I tell it. There will be no more expences  to pay for Lawyers, ect. to go to Washington  to fight for your cause, as it will be smooth  sailing into the Union. I am willing to give  you a bond to the effect, that if you do as  I tell you, and Utah do not become a state  within five years, that I will refund you  the money paid me.    Please write and tell me if you will un-  dertake this matter, will you come to see  me? That would be best. Please remember  that often it is the obscure in this world  that is the best inventors.    My ideas are too valueable to give them  away. I live at mouth of Maple Canyon,  Springville Utah Co    Yours Respectfully    Ch. E. Malmström. 
 Gunnison Aug 20th 1889    President Wilford Woodruff  S. L. City    Dear Brother–. Your favor  of Aug. 15th received.    In reply I would say, that it  is almost impossible for me to   get ready to go on a mission   this fall.    My wife died in February;  my only son is in Canada;  my things are in such a scatter-  ed condition, that if I were to   leave now, I should have to  lock up the house and leave it   to itself.    I have also made arrangements  to get married this fall; and   would ask to be released, untill 
 spring, when I hope to be able  to meet the call.    Very respectfully   Your Brother in the Gospel    Charles Gledhill    Christian A. Madsen Bishop

 Cleveland May 13.th 1896    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother    I received a call from you, dated the 6th Inst   to go on a mission to Iceland. In reply would say,  I consider it my duty to respond, when I am called  to do eney thing in this Church, as far as it is ^in^ my  power, and will except the call providing I have  a good partner to go with me, as you want to kno-  w my feeling in regards to the call, I will try  to say a few words on the same. For me to ask for  a good partner is becaus I am very poor in the  language. I came to this country when I was only  6 year old, have not studied the language as  I should have done. I can speck partly but can  not read or write the same. I realise that it will  be hart for me to ^go^ into a strange country with  out an exsperenced missionary. I hope that you  will not exspect me to. I would like to get a man  that is pretty well posted in the Iceland language  and one that knew the country a little. If thair was  a missionary thair now. which I could go to work   with as it is in other places I would not ask  what I do. My curcumstances is not as good  as I would like them to be I have a Father and  Mother about 70 years of age to take care of, and  a baby 6 months old. its mother died 5 months  ago. I will need some help in from the ward in  a financial way. but will help my self all 
 I can. I am very thankful to you for the length  of time you have given me to prepare in. I am sure  that the Lord will turn thing in my favor, with  his help I will be at the Historians Office at the  apointed time ul^n^less sickness or death hinders  me. these few words was on my mind so I thought  I would write them.

 Mar. 30, 1896.    Draper, Utah.    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:–    In reply to the call of   myself and wife to the  Sandwich Islands, will   say. By the help of the  Lord we will be ready to   sail from Vancouver on  according to the call on   the 30th of May 1896.    My delay in answering   has been because of not 
 knowing what I could  work at, after my school  closed as all of my debts  would just be canci^e^led at   that time. I will resume  teaching in Davis Co. Mar 31  for a period of five weeks  after which I will arrange  things so I can leave.    If means enough   comes in my way by   that time, as yet I havent  enough money to take  us there.

 Terre Haute Sept 10. 1838    Dear brother    I have received your letter of 25 ult°  and thank you for the favor. I am sorry you did not  mention some plan when I might direct a ^letter^ which would   reach you before you should arrive here. But presuming   you did not mean to avoid my correspondence I now   address you and hope you will get the letter at fathers,  I had calculated to go home this fall and shall probably  do so though I should much regret thus to lose [the] chance  of seeing you on your way to far west Far West.    I shall think it unkind if you do not advise me from  some point on your route when you will be in Terri Haute  that I may not be absent at that time. Suppose you  write me from Columbus, O. and if I have anything  to communicate I will write you at that place.    When you arrive at Columbus I wish you would call  on James Kilbourn Jr a Cousin and Esteemed friend  of mine. He is a young Physician of the Reformed   Medical College. was recently married as he has  informed me by Letter and is a very clever fellow  He will be glad to see you and will tell you about Uncle  Asahel Harts family. If you tarry any time at  Indianapolis you may if you please present yourself on   my account and at my risk to John W Osborne Editor  of the "Indiana Farmer." and of the "Temperance   Advocate." Mr Osborne is my friend and will be   glad to extend civility to my brother.

 Mr Francis Cunningham lives 14 miles from  East from this place on the National Road.  his place is called VanBuren. I hope you  will be kind enough to call and present yourself  and lady to the family as they will be glad to see you  on my account. They are highly respectable and  very clever people (formerly kind home). and  will treat you in a hospitable manner.    Elder Hale your friend and companion in arms,  called upon me as he passed through here last  friday. He was in company with 500 Saints going  up to Mssouri. I assure you that it was a high  gratification to me to spend an hour with one who  had journied with you so long. And my regret at  parting with him was softened only by the reflection  that the same motives which led him hither woud  would soon bring you this way and that I should  thus once more have the happiness of beholding  my long absent brother, for this event I wait with  impatience. Please renew the assurances of my  kindest regard to Mrs Woodruff. I regard her with  much affection because she is the wife of my brother.  I have learned to respect her because I know her  to be worthy. If your choice was is not sufficent proof   of her worth, I have it in the assurances of those  who have had an opportunity of judging.    Adieu  Asahel H. Woodruff    Wilford Woodruff

 Farmington, Hartford, county Connecticut, in company with Aphek & Azubah Woodruff in the front room of a house built upon  the bank of the farmington river which room is decorated by historical charts, Atlass, portraits, paintings, &c &c whare Aphek  Woodruff & his family have spent many of his former years which have gone gone forever    JULY 7th 1837    Asahel H. Woodruff. Beloved & Affectionate Brother    It is under peculiar circumstances & amid peculiar feelings that I take up my pen to once more address you & perhaps trouble  you because of the length of it. But Brother Asahel bear with me this once come now lay aside your Books and convers awhile with  Willford I have much I wish to say to you perhaps you may be interested in some of it. I have thought that I have been burthen  some to you in some of my letters since we saw each other as I have not receieved much of any answer from you perhaps they  have contained to much what the world calls mormonism to have been of any interest to you. But as I have been visiting our  friends I thought it might be interesting to you in some degree to know sumthing about it whare I have been the whys & the wharefores  &c. & I wish to write to you jut as I would talk as easy & simple as truth itself whether it is grammatical or not in or out  of measure. I am not polished in what the world calls learning (anyhow) But I desire to convers considerable with you now & if  I am troublesome tell me of it & I will do better for the future I have had a happy visit with my friends Ill now tell you about it    I left Kirtland the 31st of May & took water at fairport & arived at  Syracuse on the third of June the day following I arived at Brother Azmons  in Richland. I had not time to tarry but a short time with them. I was truly glad  to see them once more they were generally enjoying good ^health^ I think excepting Elizabeth which  was not vary good I ownly spent one night among them Thompson looked natural as ever he  works hard they looked slick around the farm. Cousin Eldad was with them he left for Con-  necticut the morning I left for Canida. I went to Sackets Harbor from thence to  Kingston took the canal up to Joneses falls we past though four locks that cost $100,000  each said to be the most splendid works in America. After attending a conference in  Canida I returned to Oswego from thence to Albany. to Canaan to Colebrook  father had mooved his family the day before I arived I called at the rock school  house three or four times to visit Sister Eunice I do not know that I can  give you a description of my visit with her any better than to copy a page from  my journal which I wrote upon the subject which is as follows    [FIGURES]    June 21st 1837. In Colebrook I wrap'd at a school house door it  opened by a female hand, and lo it was a sister, yes sister Eunice  indeed. We saluted each other with a harty shake of the hand [shorthand]  I conversed with her a few moments with joy, and retired.  June 28 th at 11 oclock AM I entered the school tought by sister  Eunice, five hours I spent within its walls amid as great variety  of sensations as ever vibrated my bosom. I beheld my sister my  ownly sister, seventeen years of age adorned with youth, modesty,  and lovliness with her face veiled with the true picture of PHILO.  with a degree of admiration I gazed upon the change five years  had brought upon HER. HER sprightly step with energy was marked  while teaching the youth. To more perfectly call to mind the rec  ollection of youth and past scenes & to entertain my mind amid the  passing hours, this sister presented me (with a cheerful grace) a  bundle of Letters from an absent brothers I looked them through  and through they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters  I read fifteen in number to Eunice directed. They brought to my  soul as great a variety of feeling as matter they contained.  They presented to my view, the display of a cultivated mind  & the refined talents of a brother presented to a sister with  the most untarnished friendship and deepest feeling for her wel-  lfare that can grace the human soul. Such teachings as these  to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would  deliver them from a thousand snares. The name of Willford  was mentioned oft Asahel had not forgotten him. (O heaven pro  tect my Parents my Brethren & my sister) While at once I viewed  this three years convers of Asahel, I smiled, I wept.    Eunice preserve those in memory of a brothers love, regard  these teachings they will lead thee in the paths of safty. I left  the house and by my sisters side I viewed the Colebook land-  scapes as we walked. my soul was pressed. O I spake of  Asahel, I thought of him, I asked what he would say if he knew  whare we were. ah says Eunice he would wish to be here. We  visited our parents dwelling at sages mill, but they had gone  to Farmington we entered the, house and found all as emty,  vacant, silent & still as death. Not a parent or brother to salu  te, we entered the chamber & saw the work of Asahels hands  but nothing left but a stick balanced by a string in the closet  to hold his coat. it was to gloomy to tarry long I droped a tear  and retired believing it more pleasent on the banks of the  Wabash or Missouri I took a drink from the well while depart-  ing Eunice plucked each of us a, rose as we left we walked up  the hill while the stones, stumps, hills & dales, looked natural.  We was soon kindly received by Mr. Jonathan Stillmans hous  hold took a seat at his board and sup'd together which closed  the scene. HOW pleasing and how painful are the scenes of LIFE  July 4th INDEPENDANCE how can I enjoy the better than to  visit a lonely sister thought I, so a steed I mounted at Canaan  to visit Eunice but when I arived she was ^x^ gone to a saleing ^x^ [sailing]  party on a pond I rode near to it as I approached they crossed  from me I hoisted a flag in token of friendship they discovered  it & bow'd to my notice but knew not that it was Willford  as the watery element wafted them from my sight behind a  grove I bowed saying GOD save my sister [shorthand] 
 I took the stage in Canaan to visit Avon July 5th I made a short  stop in New hartford shook hands with Richard B Cowles & past on I arived  at Woodford tavern & once more trod the soil of Avon. I spent the night at  aunt Wheelers I saw Daniel, & Luther, I went over to Nod to see the friends there  Daniel Wheeler has had a hard time of it in the whaleing line, he was broot ^brought^ to  America in irons & is now willing to stay in Avon friends in Avon enquire  much about Asahel they have receieved papers from the west I told them they  were from you I took some papers from Sages store Directed to father. Sister  Eunice is a fine girl she gets along well in school. Apr July 6thI left  aunt Wheelers & set out to visit the friends in our old neighbourhood &c. I  went first to Uncle Adney's he has been quite sick uncle Adney looks  very old aunt Lydia about as usu[a]l. Ezra has his poor times yet I have not  seen him from Adnyes I went to the mill Henry Woodfrord now owns it it  looked natural I went up to the house & all over it & saw bogue hill & looked  all around the farm & it all gave me curious feelings Henry Woodford not at home  I saw his wife I called at Horace Judds at Wid Allens, Zina & Obed  Harts (I was accompanied all the while by Elder Jonathan Hale a Brother  that came with me from Kirtland) from thence to Roger Woodford then I  found Eldad in the blacksmith shop. Lavillia is married to Day I took dinner  with them, I then went up to Uncle Titus Woodruff he was not at home  I saw his family Claltha Herd was there I saw nothing uncommon here  excepting a pen of black & white rabits I called upon Capt Francis Woodruff  Capt Erastus woodruff Adna &c they were all glad to see me I next went to  Uncle ^[{shorthand}]^ Ozem woodruff's he was gone diging wells or laying stone Aunt Han  nah was at home & glad to see me after spending an hour here I called to see Almira[h]  Fuller from there I went to Farmington I walked from the Canal  bank down to the house & I cry to my soul I once more saluted my Mother  by the shake of the hand {shorthand} she made me hartily welcome very soon our Father  came into the house we took each other by the hand & both rejoiced I once  more set down to the table with my Parent's father looks old he fails I wish  he might spend his last days with his sons. Mr Herd has just come into the  house he says he is well. They have had bad mill[e]rs since father left, things were  much out of repair. things look natural all about the river. I have not yet  been into the street I do not know how they look there I expect to return to  Avon on the morrow & preach in Lov[e]ly street. I preached evry day for a week on  Beach hill I expect Sister Eunice will come home soon to visit with me.  I expect to spend about three weeks in Connecticut my wife did not accom-  pany me from Kirtland for I had business in UP Canida I expectshe she  will come to Albany with some friends then take the Stage & come to Avon.  Eunice is expecting to come home (when my wife comes) to visit Father &  Mother once more I should essteem it a great privilege to see you with  us I am expecting to go infrom this to the State of Mane to visit my wifes  relatives before I leave that country I expect to visit Fox islands about  200 miles east of Mane to introduce the gospel we think it is time to begin to  [v]isit the islands of the sea five of the brethren have gone to England the work

 is progressing rapidly in the earth. I want to say a few words to you about the cause  I am engaged in & the course I am persuing. I am sensible we ought to be care-  ful what we put on paper & send abroad & I have at times thought I was not sufficiently  careful upon this subject, lest even friends draw wrong views & conceptions from  my writings & to save any thing of this nature even from your mind & wish here to  make a remark. ie. since my first conncetion with the Latter Day Saints I have  been happy, contented, & satisfied. I know & bear testimony in the name of Jesus  Christ that the Book of mormon is the revealed will of God, & also that Joseph Smith jr  is a prophet of God, & that the Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts &  graces. I know the same signs now follow the believers that did anciently & as I have  prooven this work & know it to be true for myself, I am entirely unshaken in its work  & in consquence of this, my soul being wrap'd in the work, when I have written to any  of my friends (yourself not excepted) I have principly written upon the subject  & this is why I say, perhaps I have been to tegious [tedious] in my letters to you. But I  do not wish to burthen any, of my friends in this or any other way. my ownly motive  for not writing to Azmon more than I have since I have been travling, was because  I thought they might not be entertaining to him at this time. I have written vary plain  to Azmon in one Letter it is true, But I have nothing in my breast against him  or any relatives I have in the world. Again I receieved a letter from you last  winter wishing to correspond with me & you wished to know all about my temporal  matters I set down & write you one or two vary full letters, I told you,  about my entering some land in Missouri this land I entered at congress prise pi◊◊  pir acre I ownly entered 40 acres for an inheritance or home, this money was a  present from some friends in N. Y. the Land now I suppose is worth $10 or $15  dollars per acre as it is near the county seat. I also speak of our safety fund that  I took some shares in that, now why I speak of this is, I did not know but you might  draw the idea that I had left the gospel & gone to speculating but this is not the case. I feel  that the spirit that rolls in my veins is steadfast upon the subject, & I shall go tho to the gulentine, faggot,  or death before I shall renounce it the reason of this remark is because I know it to be true. But  enough upon this subject at this time. Now Brother Asahel for heavens sake do not think  that I have drop'd a remark in this letter to cast any reflections upon you or any  body els I have none to cast. Shall it be said that we must be seperated in feelings & [other]  ties of consanguinity severed because we may not think alik[e] upon religious subjects  let God forbid, I love you. I respect you, I have never had cause to do otherwi[se]  & I trust I never shall. I thank kind heaven that I have a Brother whose interest  is manifest for the welfare of Eunice & our Parents. Brother Asahel throw a cloak  of charity over my imperfections Letters from you will ever meet a well come recep-  tion from my hand. If I live I some expect to leave this Continent for Europe  another season should it or should it not be the case it will be a great pleasure  to me to receieve letters from you from time to time I feel interested in your wellfare  both temporal & spiritual watch the signs of the times remember you have such  a brother as Willford in the world if we do not see each other before we will soon stand  in the presence of God. your parents send their respects to you, mother says she will write to you again  soon. I shall also write to you before I leave this state for the last time if I have any thing of interest for you  should you feel disposed to write to me immediately direct to farmington, con.

 Terre Haute Feb 8 1838.    Dear brother    I received your truly interesting  letter of 5th January two days since and I am happy in improving  an early opportunity to reply. I perused your letter of Nov  20th to Don C Smith published in the "Elders Journal" with  much satisfaction. The account you gave of your ministry  upon the "Island of the Sea" in that communication together  with other particulars in your last letter to me enables me to  form a pretty just estimate of the result of your labors. I am happy  my beloved brother to assure you that I rejoice in the success of  those ministers of the gospel of the Son of God who are not ashamed  to declare the truth in opposition to popular error. And although  I confess myself an incompetent judge of the merits of the "faith"  of the "Latter Day Saints" as a system of religion yet, I entertain  an erroneous impression if the struggle between popular secta-  -rianism ^(2)^ and "Mormonism" ^(1)^  is not a strife between liberty  of speech and toleration in religious opinion and their  antipodes – dumb sevility servility to the prejudices of  education and the trammels of an illiberal bigotry.    You make some allusion to the "reserve" and "distain" of some  of your friends on account (as you suppose) of your odd  religious profession. That the deportment of some of them should  be affected in some degree by this circumstance seems to me very  natural and indeed when we consider how very inconvenient  it is for most persons under the circumstances to appreciate  properly the character and motives of the "Saints" it is  reasonable to expect themat many will turn up their noses and  make wry faces. I do not however suppose that in the  care of your early acquaintances you have just grounds for  doubting their respect and confidence for as far as I am  acquainted with their views they give you much credit  for your devotion to such a cause. There is perhaps  nothing cause from ^by^ which we are so much anoyed in  the world as the misconstructions that are put upon 
 our actions thus we are continually misunderstood  and consequently our motives are misappreciated (if I  may manufacture a term). I am apt to imagain that  the world is not half so bad as it appears to be though  I must confess my conviction that many persons are  far worse than they seem. We do not know the motives  by which men are governed in their intercouse with us  and hence when their conduct is [opposed] to our wishes  and interest we set them down as bad men, while  perhaps at the same time they are only opposing to  our selfish views the purest principles of their integrity  In refference to your leaving Richland and joining the "Mormons"  I received my first impression either directly or indirectly  from brother Azmon [than] whom not even yourself could  have felt a deeper interest in a [pernniary] point of view  He was grieved and his friends sympathised with his  sorrow and I in the tenderness of my heart con◊oled with  him. I reflected upon your conduct – and passed sentence  of unqualified condemnation uupon it. In letters both  to Azmon and to friends at home I took occasion to  allude to the matters and I spoke of you leaving in terms  of reproach! I would not conceal from you that  I thought you had done foolishly or even wickedly. I  would not recall those thoughts. I do not even wish  they had not occurred for they stand an [evidence]  of my honesty and sincerity. And what is my apology?  You will find it in the imperfection of human nature.  And in appealing to you for your charity – to your brother  for his confidence. I have no doubt I shall meet a  ready response. And formy folly I hesitate not to  believe you will both find an excuse in my apology.  It was silly in me to make the remarks I did about  the Letter from England for really I had no

 Scarborough Maine May 2nd 1838    Dear Brother    While the Sun is shedding its beams to gladden  earth I sit down beneath a fathers roof in company with my  companion to address a few lines to you. My last was dated  March Vinalhaven Maine that sheet was principally occupied with the  feelings of my mind upon things future. I would here remark that  a person situated as I am in life & calling knows not whare the morrow  will find him at all times. I have of late held two conferences in  Vinalhaven one upon each Island & organized a Church in each place  both containing about fifty members & so they are now in a situation  to attend to their meetings without me I have concluded to leave  them for a season & in consequence of recieving some intelligence  of interest from the City of New York from Elder P. P. Pratt & others  I have concluded to take a mission that way for two or three months I  shall probably visit Lynn, Boston, Holliston, & N Y City as we have [Members]  in these places. The work of the Lord is progressing with great rapidity & power   in the City of N Y. under the preaching of Elder Pratt he is now Baptizing  in the city by day & night he has the use of two meeting houses & also  Tammany's Hall the most noted Hall in the City which is freely furnished and  advertized at the expens of the Infidels as the Priests are disposed to call them  the work is spreading in the county as well as City some come 20 or 30 miles  to hear and obey the gospel & the calls are more numerous than they can possibly  attend to. As to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts[,] the  Priests many of them rage and foam & go to such lengths that every honest  man is under the necessity of coming out from them. The Saints are firm  in the City & are ready to suffer death for Christs sake & the truths. I do not  know the number Baptized in the City Elder Pratt writes in his last that 75 have been  added & that the work has but just begun & sayes we are crouded beyond conception  - two pamphlets & many papers are filled against us but all tends to give us  the attention of the people The Editor of the Zions Watchman is vary busy against   us & his paper is teeming with falshood & misrepresentation. I have answered him 
 in a pamphlet of 42 pages which I want circulated whareever the  Zions Watchman has gone those with many other things sayes Elder Pratt  As our printing Office is burned I am well aware that those opposed to us in  sentiment will make every exertion to prejudice the minds of community  before we are in a cituation to answer them but I expect the Elders Journal  will soon be issued from the press at the City far West Mo There is some  individuals that have been cut off from the Church in Kirtland (by the voice  of the Church) which are making as great an exertion against us as any of the  world W Parrish is their leader; but the work of God still rolls on in spite  of all their falshoods & misrepresentations.    I have just arived at Father  Carter's from the Islands I shall leave in few days for the City of N. Y. in  company with Elder Milton Holmes a Brother that I highly essteem I have  traveled with him thousands of miles we have passed through sufferings & trials  together as well as enjoyed many happy seasons    I wish here to remark that   as I may not be stationary at present that I wish you to direct your  communications to Scarborough Maine those that you send to me  at present perhaps you may have sent one letter to Vinalhaven that I have  not yet recieved if so I expect it will be remailed to me & forwarded to Scarborough  Mrs Woodruff will remain here at her fathers house until we go west in the fall &  she will attend to all letters sent me she is enjoying comfortable health & wishes to  be remembered to you. I am still enjoying good health. I am expecting to  be gone about two months on my journey to N Y. & it is my present intention  to visit our friends in Connecticut before I return. I have not herd from  any of them for a length of time. I have not much temporal news to  communicate to you at this time business is exceding dull in this county  some of the Banks are resuming specie payment most of them I think will soon  except the rotten ones which are numerous. This state are waking up as to their  political matters they are determined to redeem themselves from their last  years negligence which I think they will do. Their is a company of Saints  expect to accompany me from fox Islands to the far west in Sept next  should you come east this spring I should be happy to meet you  in Connecticut at our Fathers House 
 When you write to me give me the inteligence you have from any of  our friends which would be greatfully recieved. I have recieved the papers  from your City which you sent me from time to time I learned  from your last that Terre Haute was an incorporated City & that you  & Mr Smith had dissolved pardonship & that you was carrying on  your business alone I wish you much success in all lawful  & honorable undertakings & I have no reason to suppose that  you will be [FIGURE] engaged in any other. I would suppose that your  tinde of business would increase & hold as good as any trade in that  country as the tide of emigration is constant & without doubt  will continue to increase. I am pleased with the Idea of your  locating yourself so far west & I wish more of our friends were  in the western country for the west must increase while the east  decreases in my view. I could not be contented to locate myself  & till the earth in New England but should delight in it in the west  I presume you are closely confined to your business as your  are now alone & perhaps you do not think of visiting the east [page torn]  at present. I should be happy to visit our Parents & Sister [once]. [page torn]  I often feel sorry for our Father considering his age & how hard he has to   work in old connecticut alone without any of his Children to visit  him or Mother I expect they have many gloomy hours thinking about  it But so it is time makes a great seperation & changes with a gener-  ation. I should be glad to hear from them & know how they get  along. I intend to write a letter to them as soon as I finish this Sheet  I want to hear from Eunice & know whare she is & what she is doing  I have not yet heard any thing from Azmon, Thompson, or the family.  if you get any word from any of them I should be glad to have you  send it to me when you write.

 Farmington June 26th 1838    Dear Brother    I have passed through such a variety of scenes, time,  places, change, events, & experience since I last wrote, & my mind is now impressed  with so much I wish to communicate that I hardly know whare to begin, or what to   say. As I sat down to write in company with Mother, Sister Eunice, & Aunt Cossett. by  the N.W. window of our kitchen a little putty [pretty] bird came & lit on the window case  by the side of my hand bearing a feather in his mouth & he tried to take hold of my pen  with his bill, what this omen is I know not, whether the bird had a message to you or what his  object could have been remains yet to be revealed I am not verry superstitious concerning  such matters & I leave the subject & haste to my business. I have had an interesting journey  through the eastern sea board towns since I last wrote you. after visiting a number of towns  & churches I arived at the city of Boston it being the ^[my]^ first time visit to the city of cours  I spent some time in visiting the different parts of it I went to the top of the splendid  State House & paid some attention to most of the objects that would be of interest  to common historians I walked about Bunker Hill monument & in fine I  spent a busy day in visiting Boston, Charleston, Cambridge, &c. with the exception  of a few hours of the latter part of the day & part of the night following I was closly  confined with locks, bolts, & bars, in Cambridge goal, not for crime but I  went in voluntarily to comfort an Elder of Israel that was cast into prison ahwile  for dept [debt]. I spent several days in Boston and preached several times among the Saints in the  city & I found the church there firm in the faith after visiting Holliston I took steem  Boat at Providence & traveled by water to the city of N.Y. of cours I saw many  things to interest me here The shipping, the city, the rich, the poor & the market made  me think of Babylon ^x^ more then any thing els. I had a glorious ^time^ here with the Saints  the work of God was progressing rapidly I spent several days in this great city & pre-  ached several [it] times to the people. Our Elders had just returned to NY. from England  they brought cheering intelligence they had Baptized about 2000 & ordained 100 Elders &  the work was progressing rapidly when they left. After spending a few days in the city I  took steam Boat for Newburg on North river from there I walked 40 miles west  to Westtown & Greenville the people here flung open their public houses, Academies,   S^c^hoolhouses, private houses, &c. & I preached about 10 days to the won⬦dering multitude 
 & quite a number manifested their faith in the work & several offered  themselves for Baptism but it was finally omitted for a season & 9 fondly left  without Baptism any in the places but I sowed the seed some of which will bring  forth fruit I next traveled by land to Farmington & was again  joyfully receeved at a Fathers House I have often wished I could have had your  company while on this visit. I never have enjoyed a visit of my fathers house  more agreeable than this, every thing looks more natural at home at this time  than it did last season. Father works hard. Uncle Ozem was sawing shingles  for father last week. I have spent most of my time at Fathers since my return.  I have preached several times since I returned to my fathers house. I have generally  had full attendance, some are believing the fulness of the gospel. Last friday I  went out to Uncle Adna's; I found a bea tree on the way, I showed Adna where it was.  I had an interview with Aunt Hannah, she is better in health, but does not yet have her  reason. I spent the night with Uncle Thadeus, next Day I saw grandmother Thompson  & Abie. Also Michael, Woodruff, little Joseph Hart, Uncle Aseph Woodford, Michael Bouler,   cousins Caltha, Eldad, Lavilla, Uncle Titus, Capt's Francis & Erastus ^[{shorthand}]^ Woodruff, Adna  & Silus, Julius Fuller, & Mirah, after spending the day visiting such folks all looking natural   I spent the night with Uncle Alson Thompson. I preached twice Sunday in  the Lovely Street Schoolhouse to an attentive congregation. Cousin Horace W  was present, I had a talk with him, I dismissed the meeting & bid them farewell &  perhaps for the last time, & walked down to Adna's with Ozem, & I preached there at  5 oclock to a congregation from Cider Brook Baldwin, [Eb[enezar & Harlow Miller, &c. I ret  returned to fathers with Aunt Cossett. I have an appointment at Fathers next Sunday  & some are going forward in Baptism Aunt Cossett for one. I shall leave on Monday  for Maine. Asahel I want to say a great Deal to you about Eunice and Mother there  minds &c. & Father but you see I cannot now, I never saw Eunice in a better state  of mind than now, I am troubled with weak eyes or I should have written more & oftener.  what destruction there is among the steam Boats. & it appears some like war to. w^W^rite to me  when you receeve this & direct to Scarborough Maine. Eunice works hard & is vary busy or she would  write to you more. I will give way for her to write the next page. Pardon my simple manner  of communication. NB NB I took a letter out of the Post Office for Aphek Woodruff from Asahel H. Woodruff  containing a treasurey Note for $50 fifty dollars which I put into his hands under date of June 9th    yours with respet    Willford Woodruff    Asahel H. Woodruff 
 [Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster]  Farmington.    Brother Asahel,    I suppose you have given up the idea by this time of ever hearing  directly from me again, but I can tell you brother, that nothing but a multiplicity  of business, would have caused this long delay, and in fact I have for a few weeks  past had no time comparatively speaking but what has been devoted to ^necessary^ household  affairs, have not retired to rest much of the time before midnight, and arise at  4 or 5 in the morning, and you must be aware I think, that after laboring quite  hard so many hours in the day. I must of course, become weary, and consequently  not in much of a writing mood, but the above apologies, bungling as they  are must for the present suffice.    I have, now, Asahel, a privilege which I have never before been favored  with, and may never be again viz. that of addressing a few lines to you upon  the same sheet with Brother Willford. you have learned of course by Willfords  communication that he is now at his fathers house in Farmington, a few mornings  ago, after breakfast, says I to mother, "I will get the front room in order, for  Willford will be here to day I guess."  I accordingly did, and paraded the [wax seal]  in the afterpart of the day, and about four oclock, I cast my eyes out of the [wax seal]  window, and to my astonishment shall I say, when I was expecting it, saw the  well known form of my Brother. I suppose it would be needless for me to express   our happiness in seeing him. for you are well aware that your fathers sons would ever  recieve a hearty welcome from Father, Mother, Sister, &c. I have so much that I  want to say to you that I very much fear I shall not say any thing of any consequence  we have had uncomonly pleasant visit with Willford so far, and ^are^ especially pleased  with his christian character, which is in perfect accordance with the word of God, and ^as^ for  myself after striving with the assistance of the spirit of God to investig[at]e the subject, which is looked  upon by the worlds people, (and even those who consider themselves no more of the world) I [very]  [looked] with contempt, permit, me to say, (by being brief) that I have "viz that  of Mormonism   to be brief permit me to say I have concluded, [the work], and that too I think ^know^ by the  spirit of God) to be from the Lord, and of coure according unto the word,  Willford has mentioned you I think, of the intended Baptism next sabbath. I really  most want to go forward with others to recieve the ordinance and ^would^ you Dear Brother  advise me not too supposing I felt it to be a duty incumbent upon me! I tell you  what Asahel, I feel satisfied in my own mind, that I shall never enjoy more  religion, if I am not willing to bear the cross and take up on me the name of  Christ. would you for the fleeting honor and pleasures of this transitory world wish  your only sister to barter, her souls salvation for the same, no. I am sure you  would not, and have confindence in you to believe, that in all the anxiety you have  for your sister, you endeavor to keep her best good in view.    [sideways text]   You see how it is sheet filled over, and I but just begun, to express my feelings.  Aunt Cossetts respects to Asahel, have 7 or 8 in our family about all of the time  have two regular boarders, young men that boarded with us last fall, work at  the Methodist meeting house. I must tell you that Uncle Ozems Letter  will be amongst   the number  baptized next  sabbath.  Eunice   [end of sideways text]

 New Rowley, Essex County Mass. July 25 1837    Asahel H. Woodruff,    Dear Brother    perhaps you will think strange  that I should call your attention to the perusal of another page  so soon from me. I remarked in my last that I should  write again if I had any thing of interest to communicate. & so I   have finished my visit with my friends in Conn" for the present at least.  I thought it might not be amiss to inform you about matters and things  July 8th I visited our relatives in west street uncle Thadeus Thompson  family & all the friends who appeared glad to see me. I spent the night with  Uncle Titus Woodruff. I found them all well. Sunday 9th I visited Uncle  Ozem Woodruff & was truly rejoiced to once more take him by the hand  I preached at early candele light at the Lovly Street School house by  Uncle Ozem's to a full congregation of relatives, neighbours, & old acquaint-  ance they gave good attention & treated me with the best of friendship[s] I  spent the night with Uncle Alson Thompson. 10th I visited Collins  ville & found the place had altered much since I lift [left] it, it was dull times  with them no business going on excepting pulling down their shops  & building greater they were making about $100,000 dollars of   repairs. I spent the day in visiting the place Uncle Ozem was at work on  the stone dam across the river cousin Samuel Barber was treading &   doing well. I preached in the city hall at 5 oclock PM. to the inhabitants of  Collinsville as I commenced speaking the drums commenced beating  at the door's which continued for half an hour, their was some tumult  in the house, however I preached them the word. Some few gave good  attention such as Samuel Barber, Uncle Ozem, & (Jerry Humiston) ^xx^  who were present. I again preached on the 11th in the Lovly Street   School house upon the Authenticity of the Book of mormon their  prejudice was broaken down they gave good attention & found no fault  quite a number were quite believeing & three offered themselves  for Babtism I suppose I must tell you who they were viz  Ozem Woodruff. Hannah Woodruff & John Woodruff their Son  I repaired to the water & baptized them with great joy & consolation   to my soul (thus ends that dream or vision which I had in Avon  when about ten years of age). On the 12th I went to Simsbury to  visit Aunt Cossetts family I had a very plesant visit with them 
 I found them all enjoying good health, Aunt Bulah not accepted.  I was made wellcome not withstanding my principles which may  appear to be dreadfull in the eyes of many of my friends   untill they have a true understanding of the matter but as soon  as they have this privilege the direfull veil is rent from their eyes  & they no longer consider Willford such a fated, desperate, &   dreadful monster or sunk in the lowest depths of vice darkness, error   degradation & infamy. I would to God that every relative I have  were such as I am this day as touching spiritural things. Aunt Cossetts  household receieved my teachings & the word & spirit bare record to the  truth I had but a short time with them I spent one night & took the  parting ^hand^ with them next day. 14th I again visited our Fathers hous in  Farmington whare I had a happy privle interview not ownly with our  parents but also Sister Eunice who had come home to visit me & my  wife while at our fathers house. I ownly had time to take supper with  them & then returned to Avon & spent the night at Uncle Thadeus  Thompson's.  15thI preached again at the School house by Uncle Ozems  16th Sunday I preached at Uncle's Adna Harts to a congregation  composed of my relatives & former Neighbour ma^n^y from Cider Brook  this was the last meeting I held in Avon. my stay among my friends  was of necessity much shortedr than I could have wished. after the meeting  closed I took the parting hand for the last time with many of our relatives  Uncle Ozem. Cousin John. & Horatio. & many others I might name among them. I  employed Solomon Willcox to convey my friends to farmington those that  had come out to attend the meeting such as Mother, Sister Eunice, & Phebe  my wife this was the first meeting they had attended of mine & after I arived  at my fathers house. I concluded to spend the rest part of the time in visiting  the old folks, & a happy visit it was to considering the shortness of it being  three days ownly. I took several walks with Eunice & Phebe they seem  to enjoy themselves well together we walked upon the canall & looked about the  river whare we [hole burned in paper] u[se]d to fish when we were boys. it looked verry natural. I hear  many enquiries about Asahel wherever he is known. On the 17th Miss  Mary Ann Hills called to pay us a visit. she spent the afternoon & took tea with us  she made enquiries about Asahel & seemed to be anxious to learn of his wellfare.  18th  I wrote an Acrostic for Eunice in her Abbum to remember me by. she is  reserving a page for you to write when you come home. I am now holding a pen  knife in my left hand that you found on the river bank & sold to me about fifteen  years ago I keep it to remember you by & for the good it has done {shorthand} l l Europe 
 {shorthand} you {shorthand}  NB 19th I gave out an appointment for preaching in the Methodist meeting house  on the public square in Farmington at early candle light the  people had but about two hour's notice & their was a thunder storm during  the time so that the congregation was not as large as it probable otherwise  would have been, besides the Prysbeterians had a prayer meeting at the same  time. but notwithstanding these things two hundred or rising of the citizens of  farmington came out to hear me. Father, Mother, Eunice. Phebe, Mary Ann  Hills, cousin Achzia were present. Also Camp♢ Deming. & many of the  Cowls'es (God not accepted) help make up the number. I gave them  our principles upon the gospel from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians 1st ch 8: 9:verses##. I was happily  disappointed oin the manner they treated the subject they gave the best of attention  & herd me patiently while I addressed them about twoo two hours & not  an objection was raised. Doct Carrington arose & manifested much  satisfaction at the privilege of hearing the subject investigated & represented  that they were in conformity with the word of God & his own feeling & most  strongly urged another meeting. Samuel Deming & others requested another  meeting. I Camp appeared satisfyed with the principles held forth.

My wife sends her respects to you. Fathers &  mother's health is good. for them. Sister Eunice is truly a fine girl, she is an accomplished  Lady I am much pleased with her appearance in company, she is not behind her sex  I think. I shall be in Maine in a few days my hea[l]th is good. I shall soon visit fox  island. I should like to read a Letter from you. Should you write to me within three  or four months direct to Scarborough. Main. Business dull in this   county, factories stoped, money scarce much grumbling cold summer rye bettr  than expected.

 South Fox Islands Vinalhaven Jan. 5th 1838    Dear Brother    I have been sitting with my pen in my hand  answering letters most of the time for three days. & as I have just taken it  off from a sheet directed to Father Mother & Sister Eunice I thought  I would next put it on a sheet for you. I have your letter dated Nov 24  now before me, & it is with pleasure I spend a few moments in complying  with its contents. In the first place I will give you a short sketch of thing[s]  with me & then answer your qusestions. I took the steamer Bangor at  Portland in a hard snow storm in company with Phebe my wife to again  visit the Islands of the sea, we had not gone far before we saw the breakers  most high we had a putty [pretty] rough time, most on board were sea sick. we  landed at Owles Head at night. I reached fox Islands the day following  being the 2nd of Nov. I found the Saints strong in the fai◇th. I have visited  three Islands since I returned, & also the Maine land. I am labouring  alone in the vineyard. But the work of God is manifesting itself at this time  with great interest in our midst. The spirit of God if like fire in dry stubble   in our midst. The word of God is like a sharp two edged sword in the hearts of men.  our congregations are large & profoundly attentive. The sea store is  Throng'd when I baptize. Many are enquireing to know what they shall do to be  saved. I have Baptized 19 since I returned to the Islands 7 of the No are  sea captains. I baptized 2 sea captains & a Lady on New years Day,  there is many ^that^ will soon follow their example here. There is now a door  open for me to preach to all the neighbourning Islands, even◇ to the gut of  Caneer & the Magdalene Islands laying 800 or 1000 miles N.E. of  fox Islands I think of going there early in the spring, & spending a few weeks    I am now on South fox Islands sitting & writing at the same table in com-  pany with Mrs Woodruff with the sea spending its waves against the rocks a  few rods from my feet. The ground is bare, the weather warm & pleasent. I  walked out last eve & this morning with Phebe & viewed the sea shore, & stood  for an hour upon a rocky turret viewing the sea foam beneath us. it speaks  the power of God. Will you inform me when you write again if you receieve the  Elders Journal. I should be pleased to have you perus that paper. I gave dire-  ctions for it to be sent to ^you.^  Elders Joseph Smith jr & Sidney Rigdon spent a night  in Terre Haute a short time since perhaps you did not see them. I shall expect  to go to Missouri next fall, & shall probably pass through Terre Haute. If you 
 are there I shall probably see you. I am gratified to learn of your prosperity in  temporal business, & I hope you will prosper in spiritual things before you  die. You made one request in your letter concerning sister Eunice which  I will answer with pleasure. In expressing myself to you upon that subject  I shall speak in confidence & unreservedly for, I consider your request  to be perfectly consistant with the interest you have taken in her well-  fare. Brother Asahel you spoke of being disturbed in your subject by a person  coming into the store I waited upon you in this will you give me the  same privilege. Thomas Arey has just come across the bay with a wherry (what we used  to call a skiff or boat) & wants Phebe & I to go home with him & spend the night he says he will bring  us back in the morning & so I suppose I must go I will continue the subject in the morning. [FIGURE] Jan 6th I have   got back we had a good sail & a plesasent time. the son shines as warm as summer the water most as still as if  nature had ceased to breathe the people say they never saw such weather here before in the winter [FIGURE] I am  glad I did not fill this sheet last night for just as I came into Capt Coombs's house this morning Mother Coombs handed  me two letters one of them was from Brother Asahel, Dated Terre Haute Dec 10th I have red it through & through,  & there is much I would like to say concerning it hiad I time & room. I was glad to learn that you receieve the  mormon papers. I sent word for the Elders Journal to be sent to you, I trust you will get it. You speak of not liking  the stile & spirit of the letter from England for my part I see no impropriety in a servent of God expressing his desires  for the wellfare of his family, if there is I have it yet to learn, however, I do not intend entering into any argument  upon the subject. from your remark I conclude you have receieved the first no of the Elders Journal. Tehere  now the captain has set a bowl of dried raisins before us to heinder me awhile. I hope Brother Asahel you will  excuse this long adjunct flung in the face of Sister eunice. I will haste to answer your reasonable request    I wish you to bear in mind that Sister is advancing in life as well as ourselves  & in giving you a description of her I can do no better than to state simple truth,  which is the best in all cases. Sister Eunice was a child of about 11 years when I first left  her in Colebrook the day before I left I took her by the hand & led her out on a  walk of 15 or 20 minutes & gave her good advice the image of her childhood countenance  remained on my mind & I could not bring any other appearance of her to my mind  except the one she was clothed in when I shook her by the hand as a little girl to go to the  west with Azmon, & this was always the case with me untill I returned last sum-  mer to Colebrook & wraped at her school house door & I will will assume you Dear  sir that wrap was made amid enexpressible sensations, when In an instant our  ownly sister stood before me took me be the hand & saluted me with a kiss, then  at that instant all of her former appearence her childish countenance departed from  my mind & recollection like electricity, yea with the rapidity of lightning. & it is  as much impossible for me now to recall & imagine in my mind how she look'd &  appeared at 11 years of age as it would be for me to imagine how you will look &  appear at 40 should you live untill that time, for you will beare in mind that a  female receieves the greatest change from 11 to 17 or 18 of any period. On seeing Eunice  I found her midling size in stature not tall, rather stocky, but of a pleasing form  with the appearence of a young woman or Lady (not a child) I think she has the looks  of Philo in her countenance. Wien I first had an interview with her she was vary  resereve bordering upon a distance. I suppose because I was a Mormon priest. you 
 know the days have been & still are in some degree that a man might as well look  for popularity in to-fet as among the gentiles with the appetation of mormon about  tims or toth advocate the principles of Latter Day Saints. & that to because, the world do  not believe the Bible. I have been surprised to see how fearful some of my relatives  and old neighbours were of me in connecticut, they supposed I had turned into an Elep-  fant, Hotantat, or an Arab, & I dont know but this is the case with you if it is I hope  you will some day learn to the contrary, but I see I am of from my subject. I  soon showed Sister Eunice by an easy appearence & familiararity that I was still  Willford & I am happy to say that I had an uncommon agreeable visit with her  although it was short, I am pleased to have a sister as well qualified to adorn  and humour the female sect, character or circle, as I consider Eunice to ^be^. I have seen  some of the world & it is verry seldom I have found a female making better  appearence in company than Eunice she is graceful modest & appears to understand  every crook & turn about right. I must confess ^xxx^ I admire her turn of  mind in mose cases, one in particular, she is not elated with ribbons, ruffles, rings  & ornamenting the body not that I think these is so much sin in these, but I am  proud (if I may be allowed the expression) that my sisters mind is more noble. I discover  some gems in her mind that most of females in riper years are destitute of. Do not  understand me by this remark, concerning dress that Eunice does not dress rich neet,  & tidy, or that her apperrel is not well aranged for she does. in speaking of her [page torn]-  ections I did not discover but one & that we are all of us more or less ge [page torn]  I mean lightness bordering upon what we call rudeness, but I was so cheerful   & sociable with her myself that I had no fa^u^lt to find with her upon that subject  I think Brother Asahel she will answer your expectations & desires concerning  her. I am in hopes with her outward accomplishments she will be a worshiper  of the true & living GOD. I hope your advise to her will always incline her  mind that way she is not insensible of the interest you are taking in her  welfare & I hope you will yet have your reward by seeing her arise  in life doing honour to her Brother, to virtue, to her parents, to all her relatives, to her  country & her God. But I must dissmiss this subject for the present by saying  that if your delight ins in the company of boys & girls in memory of your sister, I would  say that season is past with her & the refinement of riper years would more suit  case. I do not know that I have answered your expectations in replying  to your qustions if ^not^ make further inquiries & I will do according to my abilities.

 (North Lat 44 East Long 69, 10. Fox Islands) Vinalhaven Maine, Oct 20th 1837.    Brother Asahel    As I am called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defence  of the word of God & for the testimony of Jesus Christ, I am still under the necessity of  making use of my pen to communicate to you all the information you get  from me, as I am not permited at present to speak with you face to face. There  is many things resting upon my mind, that I wish to communicate to you, even  more than this sheet will contain: however I must be content by giving you  a synopsis of some few of them. Firstly, I have two letters lying before me  which are the productions of your pen, under date of July 22nd, & Sept 27th, 1837. And  dear Brother you may rest assured it is with no small degree of satisfaction, that I am  permitted to peruse & reperuse such letters from a Brother to whom I am bound  by the ties of consanguinity; & in whose best & fina^a^l welfare I feel more deeply  interested than any but mysefl ^12^ is aware of. It is truly a treat to ones soul to   receive a letter from a friend with whom he he has been long seperated: and been  called to travel among strangers for years, and not permitted to behold with his  eyes the change that time has brought upon the image & face of his friend & Brother. I  never was more forcibly struck with the change of a friend produced in five years, than  in Sister Eunice: and if the change is as great in Brother Asahel I should not know him were  I to meet him in Terre Haute. Had I room, I should like to be more lengthy in this in  speaking of both of your letters than my limits will now permit; suffice it to say  they are both interesting to mye; And I have not a relative on earth with whom I more   desire an interview than with yourself, But when I shall have the privilege God ownly  knows. I also receieved a letter from Mother dated Aug 23 which was interesting to me;  they were all well &c. As concerning myself, I still enjoying my usual good  health, peace, & contentment. {And am growing more and more formed in the faith in which I am engaged} I have thought of late  in my private walks and mediatations, that there was not a happier man on earth than  myself; except such as possess more of the spirit, knowledge, & wisdom of God, than I do; & I  hope that class are many. I am honest in saying, that I feel my peace to be like a river. (do  not understand me to intimate that my righteousness is great) I have every thing of a temporal  nature that reason can demand, to eat, to drink. to wear, my friends are numerous. I am   not as yet much injured by my enemies. I have a wife that I love with all my heart  & I have cause to do so. I am blessed in my spiritual calling in preaching the gospel  whareever I go, the word is attended with spirit and power, souls are converted to God, {thousands seek   instructing at my mouth} & even the captains that trade in ships at sea are demanding baptism at my hands;  the priests of the different religions & gospels of the day, are bitterly complaining that I   am [hole burned in paper] sap[in]g the verry foundation of their churches, & Holy religion &c. {shorthand}  {shorthand} Ah say you Willford boasts pretty well. No dear Brother I have not made the above  remarks in order to boast, for who am I, a poor, ignorant, weak, illiterate Willford. it is not I  that have done these things alone. All these blessings of which I speak have been bestowed  upon me from the hand of God, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ.  I know it requires meekness, wisdom, & good sense in times of success & prosperity,  in order to keep humble, & know & feel our prrper place. I do think the Blessings  bestowed upon me of late have had a tendency to show me my own weakness, have  pointed out the source from whence they came, & enable'd me to see that self exhaltation  is not good or profitable. {shorthand}?    [sideways text] When you write to me inform me if you have any intelligence from Brother Azmon & his family Thom-  pson &c I wrote to them from New Rowley but have not herd from them. I intend writing to Eunice as soon as  I get time, I do not find much spare time for any thing, tell me how and whare she is. Give me the news  you get from any of our friends. I expect to have a cold time of it this winter here in Maine [illegible] [end of sideways text] 
 Perhaps you would like to know what I have been about since I  I left New Rowley &c. At least I will venture to give you a brief acc-  ount of matters & things with me. On the 8th of Aug, in company with  my wife I arived at Mr Ezra Carter's My father in law in the State of Maine,  and you may rest assured we met a most welcome reception amid tears of  joy, and was entertained with every mark of Kindness, respect, & friendship, that  Brethren, Sisters, or Parents were capable of affording. Also refreshed with every  luxury of a Fathers house. I spent about ten days with these my new relatives  & friends;: I spent the time plesantly with my companion in this new circle of friends  composed of five Sisters, three Brothers, & a Father & Mother in Law with other  appendages of relationship. I found them to be universally respectable, intelligent,  influential, & possessing some wealth if I could judge from outward appear-  ances of white houses & chaise's &c. four of the Sisters have been ingaged in teaching  School, two of the Brothers in the Mercantile line in the city of Portland 10 miles  from Father Carters house. Father Carter is a tanner [ink spot] & carrier by trade  & continues the business untill this day. Phebe {shorthand} is 7 days younger than  myself I was born March 1st 1807 & she the 8th of March same month. My wife has  spent the early part of of her life teaching School, & for the last 7 years she has closely  confined herself with her nedle to the Tailoress trade, at which business she was  ingaged in at Kirtland when I became acquainted with her. After an intimate  correspondence with her, I became convinced it was the will of God for us to become  {bosom} freiiends I offered her my heart, it was accepted. We were joined in matrimony &  we live happy. {Neither of us are very handsome but we both look well enough for we are as God made us} Phebe is small in stature, possesses  an amiable disposition, is good enough for me; & sends her kindest respects to you  accompanied with her unfeigned thanks for the interest you have manifested in her  welfare; we both much desire to see you &c. &c.    On the 19th Aug; in company  with Elder Jonathan H. Hale, I took the Steamer Bangor at Portland ^PoP. 16,000^ with  the intention of visiting fox Islands. We left the Steam Boat at  Owls Head & went aboard of a sloop which landed us up on the Islands at 2 oclock  Sunday morning the 20th. It gave me rather singular feelings to be landed  upon an Island of the Sea in the darkness of the night, being an intire stranger to  all men in the region; however after wandering awhile over the rocks, we found a house we  called & went to bed. We arose in the morning, made ourselves known as servants of God & asked  if thaere was any religion or priests on the Island, we were informed there was a Baptist  church, & Priest, & meetinghouse in the centre of the Island. I will give a brief note of the town    Vinalhaven is North Lat 44 East Long 69 10. Pop 1800. St. of Maine. The town of Vinalhaven incldes both north & south fox Islands. The inhabitants  are generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous & hospitable. The people get most of their living & wealth by fishing. the town fits out 10.7  licensed sail besides small crafts. North fox Island is 9 miles londg & 2 miles wide. Pop, 800. They have a post Office, one store, a baptist church and  meeting house & a Priest. & four schoolhouses, & a grist mill. The land is a rather rocky & rough, yet there are many good farms which produces  fine wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, & grass which ais the staple productions. The timber is fir, spruice, hemlock, & birch. Sheep are the principal stock  upon the Island. Rasp & Gooseburies grow in great abundance.    South fox Island is one mile south of the North Island, & it comes as  near being without any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would puzzle the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about  10 miles long & 5 broad, and it is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, & dales. Cut up into necks, and points, to make room for  the cooves & harbours that run through & through the Island. one may form some little Idea of it, on learning that it is rising of 100 miles round  the Island to follow the beach in all its wingdings. The Pop is 1000 they get their wealth entirely by fishing. They have some sheep, & some parts  of the Island is under cultivation, but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants fish at New foundland & bring the fish home  to this Island, & dry them upon their own flakes, and prepare them for market.: they supply the market annually with great quantities of dried  fish, Mackerel, & boxed herren. They have two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, & a small branch of the Methodist Church  & a priest. The timber the same as on North Island with the addition of Pine. There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves,  & harbours, of these Islands, such as Whale, Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, Holloboat  Cod, Pollock, Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt,  Skate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Mutton fish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munk fish, Nurs fish, Sun fish, Sword fish, Thrasher,   Cat, Scuppos, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, Ling, Eels, Also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop, Mussles, Pincles, {shorthand} And Porposes, Seal, &c  &c & many others not named.    I have seen two or three Whale in sight at once. I have caught Cod, Haddock, & Hake, as fast as I could  throw out out one line & haul in another. I have stood on the wharf & caught Mackarael out of a large school as fast as I could throw in my  hook into the water & pull it out, they would bite the bare hook. or take bate out of my fingers like chickens if I would hold it in the water  I have been bathing in the salt water & seen numbers of Seal swiming around some of them near me with their heads out of water look like dogs.  {shorthand} Thus stands a brief account of fox Islands 
 I now wish to call your attention back to the first day that I visited the Island. I said  it was on Sunday & of course there was to be preaching in the Baptist Meeting house.  I hastened to the place, meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon he came to the door,  I informed him we were servants of God, had a message to the people, & wished to be herd.  he informed the priest of it. We were invited into the pulpet & our appointment given out. The  priest finished his discourse; invited us home with him, gave us some refreshment. We presented  him the Book of Mormon he did not at first object, was mild & said he would read it. He  soon accompanied us to the meeting house, the congregation was assembled, & it  was with peculiar feelings that I arose to address a congregation upon an Island of  the Sea, to present before them the fullness of the everlasting gospel, & the authentitcity of  the Book of Mormon, as it was the first time to my knowledge that an Elder of Latter  Day Saints ever trod the sail of one of the Islands, or his voice herd by the inhabitants in procl-  aiming the word fo God. I had the strictest attention of all, their appearance indicated a thought  that they had herd strange things to day. When I closed I gave out an appointment for  the four following evenings to be held in the several districts. to cut a long story short suffice  it to say, they came out by hundreds, christian & sinner, captain & sailor, priest & people,  the sound went abroad to the neighbouring Islands, their sails were soon spread to waft  them o'er the deep to hear the tidings for themselves. During the first 14 days we delivered  19 discourses. Many began to believe. The two priests made friends like Herod & Pilate, they  became alarmed, they began to oppose & rage, they had no influence over the people.  The Baptist priest spent one Sunday in his meeting house without a soul to accompany him  while I had a congregation; even his own church & deacon were attending our meeting,   investigating the subject, & inviting us to visit them. Vinalhaven never was as [page torn]  stir'd up before, in peace or war. The priest imediately sent letters to the mainl[a] [page torn]  come over & help us or we fall {shorthand} The Baptist priest fearing [page torn]  not come went after them himself, while while the Methodist priest came from the South Island & made  open war against the Book of Mormon & our principals. I attended his meeting look a min-  ute of his discours, & publicly answered his crooked remarks, & he returned home confounded  soon the Baptist priest returned with several others & held a six days meeting, it did not  take affect the mark was torn from the eyes of the people & they began to see clearly, after  I had fairly set our principals before the people, I opened a door for Baptism  & twelve offered themselves as candidates; We led them down into the sea & Baptized  them & of a truth they returned rejoicing: two of the number were respectable sea  captains. The cry from the neighbouring Islands soon entered our ears come over  & preach to us. Some came from the Maine land to hear, & they believe & wish to be bap-  tized, hundreds are believing, & many ready to be baptized. I visited South Island preached  10 times, returned to North Island, organized a small branch of the church, returned to the Main  land, travled 200 miles with Elder Hale towards Kirtland; took the parting hand with, [{shorthand}] He has gone to  spend the winter in Kirtland. I returned to Father Carters after my wife, whose company I am now  enjoying. I shall return to Vinalhaven in few days to spend the winter. I shall not return west I  think start of a year. I shall spend the time on these Islands & the maine land think for a year. I never  before have seen such doors open for preaching, the courthouse in Camden is offered me to lecture in  I shall except of the offer when I return, it is the nearest town to Vinalhaven Pop 6000 & a num-  ber have offered themselves for baptism there. Ps. I wish you to direct all of your letters to Vinalhaven Maine, for the   present, as I shall make that my stand. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Tell me of any News you get from our frie-  nds and also inform me if you get the M & Advocate now, the kirtland paper. I shall be glad to call and see you when I go west  but there is a prospect now of it's being some time first. I shall however calculate to see my wife settled in Missouri before I leave  this Continent, which may be sooner than I have calculated, we have now seven Elders in England apart of the twelve, and as  soon as doors are open in Europe so that they need help the first Seventy will follow the twelve into that country, and as I am   a member of that quorum I shall not hesitate to go when duty calls. That the blessings of heaven may attend you in every lawful  calling. & that all things may work together for your good both temporal & spiritual is the prayer of your Brother    Willford Woodruff.    Asahel H. Woodruff

I sent you a vary full sheet the the size of this Dated Nov 22nd  which I hope you have got before this time. I inserted an Extract from about 30 letters from   my Brethren in this country, & as I mailed this just Before I got your dated Oct 6th to 19th so I though[t]  I would not answer it untill I herd from you again. I however acknowledged the reception of   it in a letter which Elder Kimball wrote to his wife On the 4th of Jan your last letter Dated Nov 2nd  come safe to hand, by the barers who arived safe & are setting their business to moove  with the whole church in which they reside next spring. I trust you have obtained my letters   in answer to yours before this time, in which I expressed my feelings concerning the death of   Our dear little Sarah. your lines in poetry On her death in your Oct 6th letter were   truly sublime & affecting & none could feel them more deeply than myself. I highly prize them   more so as they came from your pen. I have recived 7 letters from you since I have   but in England, & it has truly Been a feast to my feelings to hear from you by   letter when we are seperated so far apart, in fine I never so highly prized the privilge of   writing as during the last year of my life. I am now sitting by the side of Elder  H. C. Kimball. We are enjoying good health & many Blessings from God. Hark!!! the  Postman is at my door he hands me a Bundle of Letters one a ship letter from   New York. On opening it, who can imagin my surprise on finding it to be the usual   salutation & hand writing of My Dear Phebe Dated NY. City Dec. 6, 1840 "Truly strange   things happen in the Last days" your letter informs me that Brothers J. F. Carter & L. Scammans   had visited you in the west, & wished you to returned with them & spend the winter at your   Fathers untill my return, you having excepted the offer of course accounts for your  being in New York. This unexpected intelligence for a moment gave me a peculiar   sensation of Both joy & sorrow, of Joy at the Idea of your having the privilege of spending   the winter at your friends Fathers House & among your friends & that I could the soon  sooner behold your face & enjoy your society while on my visit among our friends  in Maine, as well as your company on my journey west, calling upon our friends in   Connecticut. On the other hand I felt sorry that the packages letters & things which   I have sent you could not have fallen into your hands instead of another. or   at least that you could not have obtained them before you left. Inasmuch   as you had an opportunity to go East, I feel to say Amen to it & my prayer   to God is that you may have a good visit with your friends, & that you may   prove a Blessing unto them while you are with them, & that you may  maintain your integrity before the Lord, & enjoy peace, health, & strength, & grace   according to your day in all things, you have never been forgotten by me   before a throne of grace, you inform me in your last letter that you had  not received any lette[r]s from me since the one dated the 6th of July I felt sorry   to hear this for I have written many since that date & several full sheets the  size of this & I have taken much pains in all of them to give you information   of all things that I thought would be of Interest unto you. I hope Sister Kimball will  not send you all the packages of letters by Mail which I sent you by Elder Turley & othr   private conveyance without opening them for some of them contained half a dozen   letters for the fox Island friends & othrs, four letters contained gold coin which is not   suitable to send by mail.

 The history and travels of Zions  Camp, led by the prophet Joseph  Smith from Kirtland Ohio to Clay  County Missouri in the Spring of 1834.  Written by Wilford Woodruff Assistant  Historian, who was a member of Zions Camp    The Saints of God were driven from  Jackson County into Clay County  about the 13th of November 1833 on which  night were the signs in the Heavens of the  falling of the Stars, see History of the Church,  Millennial Star Vol. 18 Page 583. After the Saints were  driven to Clay County, they were scattered on the  banks of the of the Missouri river and in the  woods around. Bishop Partridge called a council  of the Authorities of the Church in Zion and who  called for volunteers of two men to go to Kirtland  to see the Prophet Joseph and ask council about  what course to pursue; and as no one volentered  Parley P. Pratt steped forward and sayed he  would go. Bishop Partridge asked what situation  he was in to go; He sayed he had a coat in  the world, his family wife lay sick and destitute  but he was ready to go. Lyman Wight was  the next one volenter; when asked how he was  situated and if he had means to go, he said 
 his wife lay beside a log in the woods with a  child three days old with nothing to eat, but he  was ready to go under these strange circumstances.  The services of the two volunters were accepted, and the  Lord opened the way for both of them to get a horse,  saddle, bridle, and outfit to prepare for this tedious  journey of one thousand miles in the depth of  Winter, on horseback to visit the Prophet Joseph  at Kirtland, Ohio. On their arrival there, arrival  and laying their situation, and that of the  Saints in Zion; the Prophet inquired of the  Lord, and received that Revelation, Section 103  concerning the redemption of Zion Feb. 28 1834.  (Coppy the revelation.)    The Saints of the Lord   were required to gather up the strength of the  Lord's house. It will be seen in the Revelation  that Joseph Smith and Parley Pratt was to  travel together. Lyman Wight and Sidney  Rigdon, Hyrum Smith and Fredrick G. Williams  Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt, These brotherin  went forth according to the Revelation, to  gather up the strength of the Lords house.  Parley Pratt after traveling with Joseph  Smith a while, traveled alone and visited  Richfield, Onega County, New York; where he  found Azman and Wilford Woodruff;  and held two meetings at their home, 
 where he found a few saints; and Wilford  Woodruff accompanied him with Harry  Brown to Henderson County where he  visited the few saints who had been orginized  in that region of country. His object in  visiting the saints at the present time was to  get the young men and middle aged to  go to Kirtland and accompany the Prophet up  to Missouri for the redemption of Zion. But the  only ones he got to go to Kirtland from northern  New York was Wilford Woodruff and Harry Brown  Warren S. Ingllas who arrived togather in Kirtland  on the night of the 25 of April 1834, and the first  time they met with the Prophet Joseph Smith,  who invited them to make their home with him  while they stayed in Kirtland, which invertation  they gladly accepted. Orson Pratt and John  Murdock also accompanied them to Kirtland.  The brothering were arriving daily in Kirt-  land, to preprare for their journey. One  evening while Wilford Woodruff, Milton  Homes, and sevral of the brotherin were with  the Prophet in his house he sayed "I want some  money to help fit out Zion and I know that  I shall have it." In the morning Brother Joseph  Received a letter from Sister Vose of Boston,  containing $250. He took the money out of the 
 letter and showed it to the brotherin, present  and said, "Did I not tell you [blank] last night  that I would soon have some money and  here it is." On Sunday the 27 of April the  saints met togather and held a testamony  meeting, and many of the elders spoke and  bore their testimony, among the number  was Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young,  Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Hyrum Smith,  Oliver Cowdry, and also Joseph Smith the  Prophet who closed by saying "Brothering we  are laying the foundation of a great work  and you know it not, you comprehend it  not. The work we are engaged in will grow,  spread, and increase untill it will fill the  land: it will go from sea to sea it will  fill the Rocky Mountains: all nations will  hear it: it will fill its destiny; It is the work of  Almighty God, and he will maintain and  defend it." Wilford Woodruff sayed in his  journal it appears to me there was more light  made manifest in that meeting parta  ining ^to^ the gospel and kingdom of God  than I had ever received from the whole Secter-  rian world. The Prophet Joseph called  the men togather who were gowing up  to Zion before leaving Kirtland 
 and seal them up to eternal life.  According to appointment on the 1st day  of May 1834 those who were ready left  Kirtland for New Portage, their was  but a small po[r]tion of the company  ready. The company that did  starte was composed of over twenty  men, with four baggage wagons.  Wilford Woodruff owned one of the four  teams, and baggage wagons which  he drove. The company pitched their  tents by the way. This first company  tearried with the Church at New Portage  untill the main body arrived from  Kirtland. On the 6th day of May, we  were then fully organized. As the saints  had been robbed of nearly every thing  in Missouri, the Prophet gathered to-  gather clowthing and such nesseries  of life as could be obtained for them,  also provided for ourselves horses, wagons  guns and tents for our journey, also  all sorts of munitions of war, for  self defense as our enemies were threatening  on every side. The history of Joseph sayes,  "My company from Kirtland, amounted  to about one hundred, mostly young men 
 and nearly all elders, prists, teachers,  or deacons. And as our wagons were  nearly filled with baggage we had  to travil mostly on foot. On the 7 I  gathered togather all the company  and each one donated what money  he had into one general fund; and we  appointed F. G. Willams paymaster of  the company for the funds thus collect-  ed. The following is the whole list of the  names of the camp, being two hund-  red and five men and five women,  some of whom were not present at the  first organization. (Incert the list; in the  Deseret News Vol. 14 No 1 page 21. [blank])    I asked brother Woodruff for the use of  his sword to carry on the journey  which he readely granted. We now had  in our camp twenty baggage wagons.  I continued to organize the company  by appointing sutch other general  officers as were required, and gave  sutch instructions as were nessary for  the deciplin, order, comfort, and safety of  all concerned. I divided the whole camp  into companies of twelve. Each company  selecting their own captain, who severaly 
 arranged each man in his respective  company, and assigned his place, and  duty, which was generaly in the following  order, Two cooks. Two firemen. Two tent pitch-  ers. Two watchmen. One runner. Two wagoners  and horsmen. and one comisary. We  purchased flower; baked our own bread; coocked  our own provisions generaly, which were good  but sometimes scanty; and sometimes  we had jonny cake or corn-dodger, instead  of flour bread. Every night before retireing  to rest at the sound of the trumpet  we bowed before the Lord, in the several  tents; and presented our thank and offerings  with prayer and supplications; and at  the sound of the morning trumpet every  man was again on his knees before the Lord,  imploring his blessings for the day. Our  journey was like the ancient Jaredites  pitching our tents by the way.   May 8, 1834 ~ Thursday      May the 8th.   After completing our organization by number-  ing our wagons, we commenced our march  toward Zion. The weather was pleasant, and  delightful. We traveled through the day  and pitched our tents in a beautiful  green, at Chippeway for the night twelve  miles from New Portage.   May 9, 1834 ~ Friday      9th. We continued 
 our journey and camped at night  near Woorster.   May 10, 1834 ~ Saturday      10th. Saturday, We passed  through Mansfield, and camped for  the Sabbeth in Richfield town ship. About  one hour after we had encamped, elders  Limon E. Johnson, Willard Snow and  a number of others joined the camp  from the north west parts of Vermont.  May 11, 1834 ~ Sunday      Sunday the 11th. The camp came  togother for a meeting. The sacrament  was administered. Elder Sylvester Smith  preached. We were there joined by eight  addional brotherin; in company with  elder Elias Benson from Richland and  Stark Counties, most of whom were  Germans.   May 12, 1834 ~ Monday      12th. We left Richfield  traveled about thirty five miles; passed  through Bucyrus and camped on the  Sandusky plains, at a short distance  from the place where the indians  roasted General Crawford, and near  the indian settlement.   May 13, 1834 ~ Tuesday      13th. We pass-  ed through a long range of beech woods  where the roads were very bad; in some  instances we had to fasten ropes to the  tongues of the wagons, to draw them  out of the sloughs and mud holes. 
 Brother Parley P. Pratt broke his harness;  the brotherin fastened their ropes to his  wagon and drew it about three miles  to the place of encampment on the Sci-  oto, river, while he was riding in his wagon  singing and whistling.   May 14, 1834 ~ Wednesday      14th Wednesday.  We traveled on to Belle Fountain where  we discovered refrectory feeling in Sylvester  Smith who expressed great dissatisfaction  because we were short of flour; although  we had used all diligence to procure a  supply, and captin Brigham Young  had previously sent two men ahead  to provide a supply for his company.  May 15, 1834 ~ Thursday      Thursday the 15th. We forded the  Mad river and passing through a  beautiful country, encamped a little  west of Springfield. This night Moses  Morton fell asleep while on centry, and  I went ant took his sword and left him  asleep.   May 16, 1834 ~ Friday      Friday the 16th, About nine oclock  while I was riding on a wagon with  brother Hiram, Ezra Thair and Gorge A.  Smith; we came into a place of thick  woods of recent growth, when I told them I  felt much deprest in spirits, and lonesome,  and that there had been a great deal of 
 bloodshed in that place, and when even  a man of God is in a place where  many has been killed he will feel  lonesome and unpleasant and his spirits  will sink. About forty rods from where  I made this observation we came through  the woods; we saw a large farm, and  there was near the road on our left a mound  sixty feet high covered with apple trees, and  surrounded with oats; this mound contained  human bones. At dinner time some of the  brotherin expressed considerable fear, on  account of milk sickness with which the  people were troubled dureing our route;  many were afraid to use milk or butter,  and appealed to me, to know if it  was not dangerous; I told them to use  all they could get, untill they were told  it was sick. Some expressed fears that  it might be sold to us by our enemies  for the purpose of doing us injury; I  told them not to fear, that if they  whould follow council, and use all they  could get from friends or enemies it whould  do them good and none should be sick  in consequense of it; and although  we passed through naberhoods where 
 many of the people, and cattle were  infeebled, yet my words were fulfilled.  While passing through Dayton, Ohio  great anxiety was manifested; various  reports of our numbers and designs  having wgone before us; some of the  inhabidents inquired of the company  where we were goingfrom, Captin Brigham  Young replied, from every place but  this, and we will soon be from  this. Where are you gowing? To the  west. We forded the Maumee river  with our baggage wagons, and most  of the men waded through the water.  Some ten or eleven gentlemen came  over from Dayton to ascertain our  numbers, which they reported at least  six hundred. These gentlemen inquired  of many in the camp where we  were from, and where we were  gowing, and what was our business.  They returned to Dayton and reported  that every man in the company was  a gentleman, and gave a respectful  answer to every question asked, but they  could not ascertain where they were  gowing, and what their business was. 
 This evening a court muster was held in  camp for the trial of Moses Martin for falling  asleep, on watch. Brother Martin pleaded  his own case; sayed that he was overcome  with fetague, and so overpowered that he  could not keep awake ect., ect. I desided that  he should be acquitted, and never go to  sleep again while on watch, which was  sanctioned by the court. I took occasion  from the circumstance to give the brotherin  much useful instruction.   May 17, 1834 ~ Saturday      Saturday 17th.  We crossed the state line of Ohio and encamped  for the Sabeth just within the limits of  Indiana, having traveled about forty miles  that day; our feet were sore and blistered  our stockins wet with blood, the weather  was very warm at night. A spy attemped  to get into our camp, but was prevented  by our guards. We had our sentinals  posted every night every night on account  of spies who were continually striving  to haress us by attempting to steal our  horses, ect. ect., This evening there was a difficulty  between some of the brotherin, and Sylvester  Smith on occasion of which I was called  to deside in the matter; finding a rebell-  ous spirit in Sylvester Smith, and to 
 some extent in others, I told them they  whould meet with misfortune, difficulties,  and hinderances, and sayed, "You will   know it before you leave this place," exhorting  them to humble themselves before the Lord; and  become united, that they might not be scourg-  ed. A very singular circamstance took place  that very night, and the next day, concerning  our teams. On Sunday morning when we  arose, we found almost every horse in camp  so badly foundered that we could scarcely  lead them a few rods to water. The brotherin  then deeply realized the effects of discord. When  I learned the fact, I exclaimed to the brotherin,  that for a witness that God over rulled, and  had his eye upon them, that all thoes  who would humble themselves before the Lord  should know that the hand of God was  in this misfortune, and their horses should  be restored to health amediately; and by  twelve oclock the horses were as kninbles as ever,  with the acception of one of Sylvester Smith's  horses, which soon after died.   May 18, 1834 ~ Sunday      Sunday  the 18th. We had preaching as usual, and  the sacrement ^was^ administered.   May 19, 1834 ~ Monday      Monday 19th.  We traveled thirty one miles, passed through  Vandalia and encamped in Franklin 
 township, Henry County, in the beech woods.  May 20, 1834 ~ Tuesday      Tuesday 20th. We traveled through the day,  twenty five miles, and encamped near  Greenfield. Some part of the way the roads  being so bad, I waded over my boot tops  in mud, and helped to pull through  the wagons, with ropes which were fixed  with an iron hook in the end, which was  hoocked in the tongue of the wagon, and  which was easily managed. While we were eating  dinner, three gentlemen came riding up  on very fine loocking horses, commenced their  inquiry of various ones concerning our traveling  in so large a body. Asking where we were  from, and where we were gowing. The reply  was as usual: some from the state of Maine;  another whould say, "I am from York state," some  from Maschusetts, some from Ohio, and some whould  reply "We are from the east." and as soon as we  have done eating dinner, we start to go  west again. They then addressed themselves to  Dr. Willams to see if they could find out  who the company was. The Docter replied we have   no one in particular. They asked if we had  not a general to take the lead of the company.  His reply was no one in particular; but  sayed they, is there not some one amoung 
 you; who you call your captain or leader, or sup-  erior to the rest? He answered: Sometimes one  and sometimes another takes charge of the  company: so as not to throw the burden  upon anyone in particular. Their spies  who had come from the west; passed us  several times that same day, and the next.  May 21, 1834 ~ Wednesday      Although threatened by our enemies that we  should not, We passed through Indianapolias  May the 21st unmollested. All the inhabitants  were quiet. We had been following the Nat-  ional road since the 18th, where it was traveled  frequently we had to take buyroads, which  were many, and led through thick woods.  At night we encamped a few miles west  of Indianapplias. There had previously been  so many reports that we never should be  permitted to pass through that place, and  that the Governer whould have us dispersed.  Some of the brotherin were afraid we might  have difficulty there, but I had told them  in the name of the Lord we should not  be disturbed, and that we should pass  Indianipplas, without the people knowing  it, when we neared the place, many got  into the wagons and seperating some  little distance passed through the city 
 While others walked down differant  streets leaving the inhabtants wondering  when that big company whould come  along.   May 22, 1834 ~ Thursday      Thursday the 22nd. After  traveling through the day, we encamped  on a small stream of water in a  grove near Blleville   May 23, 1834 ~ Friday      23rd Friday. After  a long days drive we encamped  about four miles from Green-Castle  May 24, 1834 ~ Saturday      24th. Saturday. We crossed the Wabash river  at Clinton in ferry boats, in very quick  time, and pushed on to the state line  where we arrived at a very late houer in  the evening, and encamped in an oak  opening in Edger County, Illinois.   May 25, 1834 ~ Sunday      May  the 25th, Sunday. We had no meeting  today, but attended to washing, bakeing,  and preparing to resume our journey.  A man in disguise, having on an old  seal-skin cap, came into our camp. He  swore we were gowing up to Jackson County,  and that we should never get over the Miss-  issippi river alive, It was evident he was a spy,  and I recollect having see him in Jackson County  Missouri.   May 26, 1834 ~ Monday      26th, Monday. A very hot day. We  traveled through Paris and acrosst a  sixteen mile prairie. At noon we stopped 
 to bait at a slough, about six miles from  the timber. Having no water to drink, but  sutch as was filled with living animals, common-  ly called wigglers, and we did not like to swal-  low them, we strained them through our  teeth; which saved the life of many a poor  animal. This was the first prairie of any  magnitude that we came to on our  journey; and was a great curiosity to many  of the brotherin, it was so very level that  a deer miles off appeared but a shorte dis-  tance. some of the brotherin started in  pursuit, before they were apprised of their mis-  take. We continued our march, pulling  our wagons through a small creek with  ropes, and came to the house of Willam  Wayne the only settler in the vacanity,  where we found a well of water, which was  one of the gratest comforts that we could  have received, as we were almost famished,  and it was a long time before we could,  or dared to satisfy our thirst. We crossed  the Embarras river and encamped on a  small branch of the same, about one mile  west. In pitching my tent we found, three  [blank] prairie rattle snakes, which  the brothern were about to kill, I sayed, "let 
 them alone; dont hurt them, how will the  serpant ever loose its vermin, while the servants  of God possess the same dispasition, and con-  tinue to make war upon him. Men must become  humble before the brute creation, and when  men lose their virtuous dispasition, and seek  to destroy the animal race, the lion and the  lamb can dwell together, and the suckling  child play with the serpant in safety.["] The brother-  in took the serpants carefully on sticks, and  carried them acrossed the creek. I exhorted the  brotherin not to kill a serpant, bird, or  animal of any kind during our journey,  unless it was nessary to preserve ourselves from  hunger. I had frequently spoken upon this  subject, when on a certain occasion I came  up to the brotherin who were watching a  squrrel on a tree, and to prove them, and  to know if they whould heed my council.  I took one of their guns, shot the squrrel  and passed on, leaving the squrrel on the  ground. Br. Orson Hyde, who was just behind  came up, picked up the squrrel and said,  "We will cook this, that nothing may be  lost." I percieved that the brotherin under-  stood what I sayed it for, and in their  practice gave more heed to my percept, than 
 to my example, which was right. This evening  Brother Parley P. Pratt and Amasa Lyman  returned from the Eugene branch, Indiana,  where I had sent them; with a company of about  a dozen men. The report of mobs which were  continually saluting our rear, caused the brotherin  to be constantly alive to the subject, and about  eleven oclock this evening, our picketed guard  reported that they saw the fires of the mob on  the south east of us. I instantly discovered the  mistake, but wishing the brotherin to enjoy  the scene as well as myself, amediately discharged  my gun which was a signal to call all  men to arms. When the companies were all  paraded, and ready for battle, I pointed them  to the reflection of the rising moon, resting on  points of timber on the east, which gave the ap-  parence of the reflection of the light, of a number  of camp fires. The scenery was most delightful,  and was well worth the trouble of any man  arising from his coutch to witness, who had  never see the like, on the broad prairie before.  This circumstance provered that nearly every  man in the camp was ready for battle ac-  cepte Gould (who was not baptized) and cap-  tain Jezeniah B. Smith who was suddenly  taken with the chollic and did not leave 
 his tent. The whole scenery was very amus-  ing. Not withstanding our enemies were  continually breathing threats of vialence we  did not fear, neither did we hesitate to  prasecute our journey, for God was with us,  and his angels were before us; and the faith  of our little band was unwavering. We knew  that angels were our companions, for we seen  them.   May 27, 1834 ~ Tuesday      Tuesday May the 27th    We arrived at the Okaw branch of the  river Kaskaskia where we found two log canoo-  es, which we tacked together, and on which  we ferried our baggage acrost the stream. We  then swam our horses and wagons, and  when we arrived at the oppiset shore, the  brotherin fastonned ropes to the wagon  tongues and helped the teams out of the water,  and up the steep bank, some of the brother-  in felled a tall tree acrossed the river, on which they  passed over, and carried some of their baggag  on their backs. While we were passing Gorge  A. Smith discovered a spring which with a  little digging furnished us with an abund-  ant supply of excelent water, which afterwards  received the name of the mormon spring.  This afternoon elder Solomon Humphry an  aged brother of the camp, having become 
 exceedingly weary leaid down on the  prairie to rest himself and fell asleep. When  he awoke he saw a rattle snake which lay  between him and his hat, which he  had in his hand when he fell asleep, coiled  up within one foot of his head. The brotherin  gathered around him saying, "It is a rattle  snake let us kill it." But, Br. Humphry said  "No I'll protect him, you shant kill him, for he and  I have had a good nap together.["]  May 28, 1834 ~ Wednesday      May the 28th.  We passed on as usual axcept suffering  much for the want of water and provisions,  and arrived at Decatus township; encamped  on a small stream of water, where one of brother  Tanner's horses died.  May 29, 1834 ~ Thursday      May the 29th.  Having to buy a horse, we were detained  untill near noon. There was some murmuring  among the brotherin; many wished to go  on, and not tarry with the rest of the company  for the day; and some had already started.  I sent for them to return, and called the  whole camp together and instructed them  not to scatter. I told them if they went  ahead of the camp in a scattered condition  they whould become weary, lie down on 
 the ground, when their blood was hot  and very likely to take diseases such as  ague, fever and fever which is perverted in this  climate, as they ought never to lie on the  ground, (which is alwase) damp) when their blood  was hot, they whould also be in danger of  being killed by our enemies, and none of  us be the wiser for it. I then proposed for a  diversion, that we divide the camp into  three parts, and have a sham battle, which  was agreed to by all. Brother Roger Orton  lead one part; Fredrick G. Willams another  division; and I remain in camp with   third division. They returned to the woods  with their divisions, and soon attacted the  camp, which we defended by various manuvers  for some time many of our Captains showed  considerable tact, and was more acquainted  with miletary matters, than I had expected.  Every thing went off with good feeling, although  captain Heber C. Kimble in receving a charge  grasped captain Lewis Zabriskie's sword and  in indeavering to take it from him had  the skin cut from the paum of his hand.  After the sham battle was over, I called the  camp together, and cautioned them to be  careful in the future, and controal their spirits 
 in such circumstances so as not to injur   each other. We traveled acrast the prairie, and  encamped in a strip of timber, where we  stopped to dine. I wrote a letter to the brotherin  in Missouri (dated camp of Israel) requesting  some of them to meet us as soon possiable,  and give us information of the state of things  in upper Missouri; and sent the letter to  Springfield Post-Office, by Dr Willams. At this  place I discovered that part of my company  had been served with sower bread while  I had received good sweet bread from the  same cook. I reproved Br. Zebrada Coltrin  for partiality, for I wanted my brotherin  to fair as well as I did. (The brotherin in  Clay County wrote the following letter  to his Excellency Danial Dunkin, Liberty,  Missouri May the 29th, 1834 Sir. (copy the letter  from page 317 A. No. 2)  May 30, 1834 ~ Friday      Friday the 30th  Fredrick G. Willams and Almon W. Babbet  went ahead into Springfield in disguise  to learn the feelings of the people, and  procure some powder. We passed through  Springfield our appearance excited considerable  curiosity, and a great many questions  were asked, the spies who had followed us 
 so long pursued in very closely, changeing  their dress and horses several times a day.  Brother Eleazer Miller with others joined the  company with three horses about noon, a  little east of Rochester. This recrute was  very seasonable as many of our horses were  afflicted as they very frequently were in  changing country climate and food.  Many of the horses after eating dry corn  and prairie grass would be served with  colic cholic, and bloat very badly. Brother  Ezra Thayer administered a medacine  mixed in a great stone bottle, prepared  as follows, a three penny paper of tobbacco,  half an ounce of copperns, and two  table spoons full of cayenne pepper, and  the bottle filled with water when he could  not whisky, one half of a bottle constitutes  a dose and whould unvariably cure a  sick horse in a few minutes and is  worthy of rememberance. Br Thayer called  his medicine 18 by 24. We encamped about three  miles from Springfield on Springfield creek.  F. G. Willams and A. M. Babbet returned  to the camp with two kegs of powder, and  reported, that the people were somewhat excited,  more however from a cureosity to know 
 where we were gowing than from a desire to  hinder us. A brother came to see us with news  that my brother Hiram had passed on west  the day before with a company about fifty  miles north of us and saying "he has a fine company,  and they all look mighty pert." I asked him to  accompany us to Missouri, he replied "I cannot."  He went and stayed with the spies at a tavern  over night, who said they had followed us three  hundred miles on purpose to take some advan-  tage of us.   May 31, 1834 ~ Saturday      Saturday 31st.  In the morning this same brother came to me  and said, "I whould be mighty glad to go with  you, but my business is such I cannot; will  a hundred dollars do you any good." I replied  "Yes it will, for we are short of money" He ame-  diately mounted his horse and rode towards  Springfield, and within an hour after the camp  had started, he returned and said to me "I  am mighty sorry I cannot go with you  here is a hundred dollars, and if I had, had  a few days notice I whould halve got more."  At noon we halted for dinner. A man apparently  drunk, came to the camp and said he had  a large farm fourty cows, a little way ahead  and if we whould go there, he whould give  us all we wanted to eat and drink, feed our 
 horses ect, ect, but I soon discovered that he was  more sober than drunk, and that he was probably  a spy. Near night we arrived at a small stream  of water about one mile from Jacksonvill where  we found a paw paw bush in the road,  which had been dropped as a signal for  us to camp, by Dr. F. G. Willams, whom I  had sent forward in the morning on horse-  back, to select a camp ground and watch  the movements of our enemies. Here we pitched  our tents agreeably to my instruction about  sunset. Brother Roger Norton proclaimed about,  that there whould be preaching under the trees,  within the camp at half past ten on the morrow.  There was only one stranger in the camp to  hear the appointment, Dr. Willams had  gone on to Jacksonville with his pill bags  to spend the night  June 1, 1834 ~ Sunday      Sunday, June the 1st.  This morning at half past ten oclock, our  trumpet (a common brass french horn) sound-  ed in the camp for preaching, there were some  two of three of the people from Jacksonville, and  the surrounding country gathered under the trees  within our camp, and a chest was brought out  for the accomodation of the speaker, when squire  Cook (as I was called) amediately took the stand
