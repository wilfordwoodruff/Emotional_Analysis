 You remarked that if you was expecting A letterfrom Brother Azmon I should be pleased to haveyou write to me from time to time while I amehere & should you do so give me the news fromBrother Azmon & his family & our Parents or any other friendsthat you should hear from. I have not herd from BrotherAzmon (except a few words from Mother) since I left Liberty, Mo.Brother Azmon has much changed his religious principlessince I saw & left him what they now are I know notI receieve a letter while at Missouri from him stating thathe had Left the Church of Latter Day Saints & advised meto do so. I do not exactly se[e] through his object or meaningI have nothing against Brother Azmon I wish him wellSoul & Body & all his family I parted with them all inpeace & do not know that he has any thing against meI left all my property in his hands & gave him powerof Atturney to make use of my name in selling resting&C. that our creditors might be paid & satisfied I have had noevil intention in leeving that country I did not run awaynor go away secretly all my neighbours in Richland knew itI laboured hard before I left & settled with all in that ^country^ or nearlyso except our friends in Connecticut & one would naturallysuppose that $2,000 dollars worth of property out to pay $5.00[do]llars of debts I am perfectly willing that Br Azmon &every other man should enjoy his own opinion as to religioussubjects or any other. When Brother Azmon Joined the Churchof Latter Day Saints he was vary strong in the cause inBelieving the Book of Mormon & bearing testimony to thetruth of it & professed to receiev great blessings which Ido not doubt But as respects myself I cannot leeve theChurch & Cause which I have espoused No I to[o] highly prisethose Eternal & Immortal glories to sacrafice them for thethe things of this world which will perish with there using NoBrother Asahel the Church of Latter Day Saints is not a fictionI have had somthing of a chance to know I have travledabout 1,000 miles with the Prophet & Seer of the Church I haveattended the conferences & been acquainted with the first Elders of the Church I have herd their teachings & beheld thethe spirit they were of & the gifts & graces which Christ saidshould follow the believer (or Signs) are manifest in theChurch for what a person has experianced he knows I havebeen made partaker of some of the blessings myself suchas the gifts of healing Tongues & interpetations of tongues forwhich I feell to thank God (not wishing to bo^a^st) but acknowledgethat every good & perfect gift cometh from God which is thesame yesterday to day & forever & his Gospel gifts & graces the same& the same causes produces the same affects to day as Anciently

In fact the faith of the Churchof Christ of latter day saints has not ben sufficient amid such a world of unbeliefto perform many great miracles The sick have been healed & speaking and interpetingother tongues are common but thanks be to God if the Church continues to go fromgrace to grace and from faith to faith it will soon lack no good gift and as theLord is the same in time and in eternity yesterday to day & forever if we as saintsare pure before him what Enoch saw we can see what Moses did we can do what Peter had we can have what the saints endured, we can endure and whatthe righteous receieve we shall receieve.

 Canaan July 9th. 1837Dear WillfordHaveing just returned from meeting withbrother Smith and wife where I was expecting to see you as brotherSmith was expecting you and brother Hale to be there I learned thatyou was gone to Farmington and wished to know when I arrivedin the this place I would just say that I got here (to brother Smith's)yesterday about noon. had a good passage was out ten days. was detainedon the way 2 days. came alone from Buffalo. brother [Wed] and wifecame as far as there with me. I received your kind letters the Sabbathafter they were written by the hand of brother Gribble and the contents[page torn]isted me much without it I should not have been able to have come[page torn] as I was dis-appointed in selling those skins all but 3 whichbrother Redfield to and paid me six dolls. I should have answeredyour letter immediately but was expecting to come immediately andtherefore thought it unecessary as I though I should get here nearlyas soon as a letter but I was detained many days longer than I expectedto be. There was something ^said^ by some of the brethren about your returningto this place again before we went to Maine but they could not realytell what therefore I am calculateing to start next saturday forFarmington if you think of comeing come before that time if youcan. The brethren ^are^ anxious to have me stop and make a visitwhich I [havecluded] have concluded to do so as to rest myselfas I was much fatigued when I arrived here. br Give my respectsto brother Hale and tell him that his family are well but his wifedid not write by me for want of time but sends a message byme to him which I will deliver when I see him. I do not 
 mention particulars as I hope soon to see you and can thentell you more than I could write at present as I am in greathaste and am writing almost upon the run so as to mailmy letter to night. I did not have to do as I told you Iwas intended to when I arrived here for sister Smith knewme at the first sight. all the brethren and sisters are verrykind indeed. Brother Joseph Smith has been verry sickbut is recovering now.I remain yours affectionately as everP. W. C. WoodruffN. B.

 Mr. Willford WoodruffFarmingtonHartford CountyConnecticutNorfolk Ct)July 10th)[Wilford Woodruff] Phebe W. WoodruffJuly 9th 1837 
 Scarborough  Aug. 5th. 1837Dear WillfordI have sent to the Office a number of times since you left herehopeing and almost fearing that I should receive a line from you. I say fearinglest it would say that you was not about returning as I have been pleaseingmyselfe with the I idea that I should soon see you again although I have feltanxious even to hear from. If you reco^l^lect you mentioned not writing if yourstay was short–but let me say that your epistle came to hand last eve andmet with a pleasing reception. I perused its contents and was truly rejoicedto hear of your good health and spirits likewise of your prosperity in the causeof Christ and that the Spirit of God attended you and brother Hale and openedthe way before you booth temporally and spiritually as I felt verry anxious aboutyou knowing your circumstances and that your temporal meanes were verrylimited. Well we will acknowedge this to be another proof that the Lord isnot unmindful of his servants and all that put their trust in him. He isable and will give us that which is best for us, although the way seames verry darkbefore us sometimes, yet he sees fa^r^ther than we do.After reading your letter I[fe]lt encouraged and satisfied to have you about your masters business althoughI have felt some lonely and would like much to see you and enjoy your company,yet I think that it will be much better for us both to be in the place appointed tous by God, if it is to be separated a while than to be elsewhere.Willford I per-cieve that the day is at hand when the salvation of souls and a seat in the celestialkingdom of God will be of more value than the shining ore which many spend theirwhole time and talents in persuite of in this life– therefore I hope that you willever be diligent in keeping the commands of God and in dischargeing your duty fai-thfully to this gene[r]ation that you may be the sooner discharged from your warfareand be permited to dwell (with one in whose affections you share largely) in peaceand with the approbation of heaven saying "I have fought the good fight I have finisedmy course I have kept the faith" &c&. If we seek first the kingdon of heaven we have thepromis of all things being added to us–yet my heart will sometime distrust providenceI then take a review of the dealings of God towards me and the promises left on reco-rd for those who keep the commands of God. this stimulates me to diligence andpersevereance and to try to endure to the end and then obtain a crown whichI trust is laid up for me if faithful. I find it to be rather hard liveing here spir-itually as there is much darkness and opposition in these regions but my faith is asstrong in the gospel of Christ as ever and I think if I keep close to the rod of iron 
 I shall get through. It is a verry darke time here now–it appeares as thoughevery ones heart is closely shut against the truth in this place and H. Harmondis as bus^i^y as a bee in the summer in putting down mormonism as he calls ithe says he is determined to put it down–Yet I rejoice that the hearts of some areopen to receive the truth even on the Islands of the sea and pray the Father of Heaventhat you may have many souls as seales of your ministry. Believe me Willford Ihave not forgotten you or brother Hale once ^since you left^ when alone before God but asked himto open the hearts of the people to administer to your temporal wants and give youaccess to their hearts that you ^might^ speak the words of life to them and receive it. I ampleased with brother Hales prosperity as it is some ^thing^ more new to him to travel andpr^e^ach than for you. brother Willy said before I left Kirtland that he would nothold one meeting alone this summer, thus we see that he was mistaken and I rejoicein it. I think that he will make a mighty man for God if faithful.You mentioned something about letters comeing to the Office for you I have taken out twoone from Mother Woodruff bearing date of Aug. 22 – and one from Asahel H. Woodrufffrom Terrahaut bearing date of July 23rd. directed to you in Farmington, it was takenout there and then remailed and then remailed and sent to Scarborough. Mother Woodruffmentions the reception of your letter–the bank note and the bowl of bread and milkw^i^ths with which you was favoured on a day of your journey–thinks the promis notmade void that as thy day thy strength shall be says that the health of her family isgood or that hers is not quite as good as when we was there. she says that she was aboutto write to Aunt Coyssett when verry unexpectedly Betsey came into the house andher mother soon followed her. says they came away in haste hopeing to see youagain–says it was her intention to have been baptized had you been there. Mothertold her she was in hopes to see you again this fall. she has written to Azmonds'family and to Asahel and say's her sheet was well filled she gave the particulars ofyour visit with them and the reception you met with among your relat^i^ves. she saysthat she wrote something to Azmond and Elisabeth by request of sister Coysettthe substa purport was this, that from an interview with you she believed youto be right and engaged in a glorious work. and Uncle Ezra was much di^s^appointed in not seeing you and hearing your discourse at uncle Adner's as he did not hearof it before it was to late. Mrs. Alling called on her (Mother) recently she said thather mind and heart was open in view of this subject. Uncle Ozem has lost a childof late. As her letter was lengthy I have just given you a few items and preservethe original for your perusal when you return. also of Asahel's he mentions the 
 reception of your of your letter dated at Farmington and makes many friendly remarksupon the subjects of friendship connections mormonisn &c&c. We have received a paper oflate from Kirtland–there was not particular news in it accepting that the inhabitants of theCitty far West had chosen 2 Judges 14 Justices of peace and established a post Office.Therefore I fear that your letter will get lost by the Office being in another place. Ifinished that letter which you commenced to Sarah and Aphia the next sabbath andsent it. Tell brother Hale that there was a letter came to the Office for him a day or twoafter he left here. I will now forward it to him[e] with this. The health of our family isgood with the acception of Mother's and I think her much better than when you left, shewishes to be remembered to you. I have been quite unwell one day and night of latebut have far recovered. sister Shuah's school closes this week and sister Rhoda expe-cts to be change her situat^i^on in life next month. brother Fabyan and wife send theirbest respects to you likewise allof the family. You said that you felt easey about mewell I am receiving every kindness that my fathers house can afford. I have been spending some time with sister Foss she wants to see you much. Brother Toronsen works justabove there–he called on us Sabbath afternoon and spent the eve with us–we had a little prayermeeting which seamed quite encourageing. I feal that I am almost alone spiritually thereforeI hope that you and brother Hale will continue to pray for me for I feal that I nead theprayes of all who have access to the t^h^rone of grace–You shall have mine. When the eve twilightcomes Phebe wishes that she could see and converse with you for a few moments at least, butshe cannot at present–she can retire in private and ask the Father to keep and presere youand give you wisdom knowledge understanding and strength equal to your day. I hope thatyou will be faithful and that all the people on the Island will be wise in time to securetheir salvation. Was I near you I should like much to go to meeting with you occasionally.You requested me not to send any letters to brother ^H.^ if they come to this oOffice after the 15th. of thismonth and that you should come in about 2 months are you expecting to stay longerthan he does. I recollect those pebbles–children are pleased with something new. I have notlearned styrography yet–but am waiting for you to come and learn me. Write often for I [illegible]liketo receive a line from you any time. I am expecting to go to Portland tomorrow to spend afew days. Give my best respects to brother Hale and accept a large share of themyourself.

 88 Bowery Street New York Oct 23d 1839Dear PhebeNotwithstanding we are at times flung into the deepest suspens inconsequence of not hearing from our dearest friends for a season yet I rejo-ice that the day comes when we understand the cause of all & our minds areunloded of its burthen. As it has been with you so it has bean with mein one respect: I have looked with feelings of the deepest interest for a letterfrom my Dear Wife (in whose bosom my heart has a resting place) but I had lookedin vain untill I began to think that I should no more hear from my Phebe &Sarah untill I left the Shores of America But thank the Lord my great suspens& fears (for great they were) are now removed. yesterday after spending several hours withBrother Ilus in his Store (who is well & in good spirits) I went to the post Officeas I have done almost every Day or sent.

As regards your Situation in Sickness I trulyfeel to sympathize with you & Sarah, your situation has been shone me I have hadseveral interviews with you since I left home & I have been aware that youwas in affliction. but your patience & resignation in your trials as great consolation to me & I can still have confidence my Dear companion to inviteyou even in your Deepest trials to leam upon the arm of that God who hasupheld you untill the present day we can do no better than to trust in himwhether in life or Death. the Saints all seem to be much afflicted this seasonBut may the Lord have mercey upon us all I pray & not take our lives fromthe Earth but that we may be humble & finally have a victory over the destroyerbut even should we die some of us it would be in one of the best of causes& we should sleep but a short time before we should be awoke & meet togetherin a glory Celestial to part no more whare sickness & sorrow is known nomore But yet I expect to enjoy Blessings with you & Sarah in the familycircle though I thus speak, I truly felt sorry to hear of your & Sarah's sickness butI feel thankful that you have any friends that are able & willing to render you

Phebe I have a greatdeel I want to say to you in this lietter. As far as my health is concerned it hasbeen vary unsettled I had but one chill after I left home which was [next]day for about 4 weeks I took however some of Sapingtons pills whichstoped my chills & fever & I had no more untill I arived at Buffalo with theexception of a light chill in Germontown Wane County Ia which was broughtupon me by preaching & sitting down by a window & the wind blew upon me &I was chilled Br Taylor followed me though he was very feeble in the first stag[e]of the Billious fever I have not roon to tell you much about it for I supposehe hath written to Sister Taylor before this time & informed her of it. I was obliegedto leave him in Germontown but It was with a family of the kindest people. butas I was feble Brother Taylor wished me to continued my journess & he would taryuntill he got well he was vary Sick 2 weaks & the fever left him low & it took twoweeks more to recover his health I have not seen him since but am expeting himin this City every day. My chills returned as I took the canal Boat in Albay inconsequence of being in a storm on lake Erie & taking cold I had a chill Evey dayfor 8 days but they were light, & soon as I arived at fathers my chills stoped forseveral days & then returned for several days. On the 27th day of Sept my Grandmot[her]Thompson Died aged 84 years. Also on the 4th day of Oct Uncle Adna Hart died aged43 years both of Avon I was called upon to preach the funeral Sermon ofAdna Hart & the town was set at the time my chills was upon me but Iattended the funeral preached to the people & had no chills or fever during theday nor but vary little Since. I left Fathers the 7th of Oct & arived at New yorknext morning at the Store of Brother Ilus F Carter I have called upon himfreequently Since I have been in the City I reiceved a letter from Sister Fossfrom the Hand of Ilus in answer to the one that I wrote her from Terre Haute onthe 25 Aug. I have visited the Church at Sing sing & Brooklin since I arived in this city& I find among them as well as though this City many Mothers & Sisters that feel & actas though they could not do enough for me they spare no pains to make me comforta-ble & happy & to supply all my wants your petitions are fully answered in this respect Imean your written petition that I foud in my trunk which I have after readwith great satisfaction. I am glad indeed that you wrote me when you did forI am now expecting to take water for Liverpool the forepart of the comeing weekprobably on Monday in company with Elders Mullener & Wright & BrotherTaylor if he arives before we leave. & as to the rest of the Twelve I know nomore about one of them thatn if they were in another world I do not knowwhether they are in Montrose, Commerce, or whether they are on their Journey 
 I cannot hear a word from one of then from any source whatever. I was sorrythat I was not privileged with a few words in your letter upon the subject as Iwas so long on the way myself I expected to have found then all in New yorkif they had not left for England. but I have waited & delayed the time untillit is begining to be cold weather & as I am some out of health I feel it myduty to cross as soon as possible & I am in hopes to see the Twelve in Englandif I do not see them before give my respect to any of them that you may see orany of the Sanits [Saints] that enquire after me esspecially Brother & Sister Smoot, Jemina,Brother Hawley & family (tell them I called upon their Brother in Rochester Mr Satley &found him vary believing) & all Saints in Lovely Street or els whare I cannotname them. With regard to the putting on of flamnel a Sister has this day givenme a nice cotten shirt & is preparing flannel underbodies & drawers for me outof her store. but I must stop speaking of those small things & say a few wordsconcerning the great work of God. I Baptized cousin Betsey Cossett in Farmington,the work of God is spreading wider & wider in this City & in the countrys aroundabout Elder Ball & perhaps some others have done injury in this City & cou-ntry by running from church to church & doing those things that are not accordingto the order of God but yet the work of God rolls om this Nation begins to feel thechastning hand of God fire & pestilence has almost desolated some places [Mobele]for instance: such fires [are] so numerous was Never known in these last days asnow, this City has suffered much lately by fires. & in addition to this the Bank [page torn]charts are like troubled waters, & the Jews are rapidly flowing into Jerrusale[m] [page torn]letter has just arived in this City to a Jew from a Jew in palestine stating amongmany other interesting things that their is now Standing in Palestine & Jerrusa-lem 1,44000 Jews & they are constantly gathering. H A R K!!! & I will tell yousome news which will counteract a part of this letter. P.P. Pratt has just arived in thiscity with his family. I have just had am interview with him. We now expetOrson Pratt & Br Taylor & some others every Day, & we now expect to tarry in thiscity untill they come & perhaps others of the Twelve & we shall hold others of the aconference here before we take our departure for England which will of coursedelay our passage for a while. I am glad Br pratt arived before I mailed this letterI may write you again just before I leave New york. Phebe if you do notrecieve letters from me often enough or in their Season do not think it myfault but attribute it to the Mails which are uncertain, for you may rest assured Ishall not forget you but will write often & I hope you will be able to do so by meI have had no opportunity as yet to send with any safety those things to you that we spokeof prarley has brought a package from you to Ilus. parley & family are well I must did [bid]to a close & leave out many things I would like to say.

 New Egypt, New Jersey, Nov 24th 1839My Dear PhebeI once more sit down to write a letter to you, this is thefourth letter I have written you since we last parted, but whether you getmy letters or not I do not know know. I have not recieved but one letterfrom you but I was truly thankful to hear from you once, and I havebeen sorry that I did not request you to write immediately to New Yorkas soon as you recievied my letter under date of 23rd of Oct, I couldthen have had another letter by this time but I would now say, that I wishyou would write to me as soon as you get this & direct it to me atNew York City & I may get it before I leave for England. I will writeyou again before I leave the City & tell you whare to direct to me inEngland. I feel more ankxious to hear from you & Sarah because of yoursickness. I wrote a letter to Brother Luther Scamnon's & Sister Foss a shorttime since. I recieved a letter from Sister Eunice a few days sincethe friends all well Mother's health good.

I took a severe colda few days after I last wrote & it settled upon my longues & I had a dreadful coughfor several days & it left me. I had the last chill & fever on the 26th day of Oct. Onthe 1st day of Nov I accompanied three Elder viz Clark, Wright, & S. Mullener on boardthe Ship Tarolinta, capt Smith bound for Liverpool, they took steerage passage & looked quitecomfortable fare $12 & find themselves & after committing those Dear Saints of Godinto his care, I took the parting hand with them, may the Lord go with them& bless them I pray. Nov 5th I went to long Island & for the first time sinceI left you I was able in body to take a regular course of preaching I preachedevery other night & three times on the Sabbath. & on the 13th Elder O. Pratt came downto the Island & joined me in labour before we left, we had large congregationswe left many believing & their was rising of 30 baptized by other Elders when we wentthere, the last meeting we held, the friends gave us a collection of $25 dollars toassist us in our travels.

Brown & a number of other Elders were present, & after sitting in conference 
 ^The following Page is for your Private perusal^Phebe I know you have made sacrafices, & great ones to, you have madethem for Jesus Christ & his cause, & you have made them for me: some ofthem have been of such a nature that it hath required all the powers of thesoul to pass through them, & those sacrifces still continue, even our seperationis required for a season in order to do the will of God, but I think you aresensible that no worldly honour or Earthly gain would cause this our seperationNo nothing but the commandment of God. Notwithstanding the gate is strait& the way is narrow O! do not shun it, walk in it, yes walk in it for my sake, & seeknot death, but livie, yes live for me. Our sorrows, our trials, our sacrafices soonwill end, & in that rest that remains for the people of God thou shalt be comforted.Stand by me & maintain thine integrity untill we enter those glories that areto be revealed at the comeing of Christ & thy joy shall be full. O! the glories ofa celestial Kingdom I long for thee, for thee I pay my sacrafice. O! kind hearerseal my prayer, grant my request, give me an enterence with my rib my childwithin thy gates, & glorify our souls with Eternal light & truth & united pow-ers inseperable. Ah Phebe I have had to much of a taste of those Eternal &Almighty truths appertaining to the Celestial Kingdom of God, to let go my graspI have put my hand to the plough I cannot look back, I mustfinish my work that My father hath given me to do, & I have confidenceto believe that I shall have your assistance unto the End. I know I havemy imperfections, & it is with a degree of sorrow that I reflect upon somepast hours of my life that I might have spent to better advantage & more tothe happiness of myself & others, but my determination is to spend the futureaccording to the best light the Lord giveth me, [loft] me up by your prayers andconfidence you have mine. I will try to prevail with the hear [page damaged]your behalf that the Lord may comfort & heal you & support yo[u] [page damaged] Onthe deepest wounds of affliction & sorrow & enable you to be res [page damaged]to the will of God in all things, & wait patiently for my return. Should itbe our lot to enjoy a long Eternity together in that society whare tears arewiped from all faces & sorrow & sighing are known no more, we shouldnot regret having passed through trials here in the flesh. All the ancientSaints & Jesus Christ not excepted had their trials to pass through but theyare now glorified, & as it is now our turn & we are living in this last dispensation & have a great work to do, then should we not act nobly, walk by faith &do our work in patience untill we can say it is finished. We are not alonein this great cause, the Heavens are deeply interested in our welfare, ourcause, & our work. It is true we have a great warfare to accomplish in order to over-come, the power of the enemy is greater than some suppose. It has already requiredGod with the armies of heaven to wage war with him that Satan might be castdown with his influence. If so then we have strong powers [to] contend withbut with the assistance of God we likewise will overcome. I feel not atall discouraged my way is onward. I am detemined to run the race (by the help of God)that I may win the prize for myself & family. When I meditate upon the dealingsof providence with us both since our connexion, the manner in whichhe has delivered us from the power of the Enemy, & saved us from the jaws ofDeath, & supported us in the midst of trials of the keenest nature, I still feeldisposed to trust in his name, rely upon his word & [seorve] serve him untothe end. O! may the Lord bless thee, comfort & support thy soul untill thou artperfected in Christ Jesus; (do not fail to write me as soon as you get this, tell me all the news. areyou in your new house & comfortable. has Sister Taylor herd from Brother Taylor if so whare is he, give my respets to herBut while all nature is wraped in midnight darkness I lay down my pen & retire to rest & think of thee.

 Jan" 29th 1840. At Alfred Cordon's, Club buildings, Navigation road, Burslem, Staffordshire, England.My Dear PhebeWhile seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusalMay grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORDJESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letterwhen I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arivalBut knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of myvoyage & travels since I left New York to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regularpacket ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most allon board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale atnight, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & asrough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feetabove us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat ondeck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the morning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fairwinds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Blackfish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. Thiswith the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing wavesmade much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their isnot much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for oneis frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thicktogether in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls alongrough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 dayswe have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breezesail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past herwith great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deckviewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a numberof fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days atsea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloatfrom the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-ing the St George's channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining oureyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irishcoast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the lighthouses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. Wereached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a piloton board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had notyet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she leftNew York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first timethat they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]atedbefore the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to beunreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had notsailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steamBoat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stoodthousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed& fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a fewminutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance shouldall reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxfordbut so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first timeI began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of whichwere splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever sawThe Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson'sMonument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chainaround their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly coveredwith a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument thoughthere are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is muchNoted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil--ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings arefar more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of theirbuildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the wholehemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the airis vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstandingEngland is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York toLiverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it varysingular to hear the Rector's, & Curit's preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion withouthaving the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting atPitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thinghas attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poormale & female, their cloth may be equ⬦ally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appearas tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposittheir dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms apavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to betaken from the ship & go to the custom Hou⬦se & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars  run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The carsrun rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to oncemore behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in conversation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from thethe factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I shouldthink were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house inPreston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool &Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & WillfordWoodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will goto Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york& is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley andClark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has aChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cottonmanifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brotherto visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 mento keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name ofJesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]& composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]edthe devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the dayI do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19thSunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in Englandthe people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which werehealed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach& road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred CordenThis is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare mostof the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordonhe went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in aweek for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saintshave the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to theirteachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God isthat all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day lastfor I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have beganto preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine& keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecutiondoes not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followedme two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have foundit to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us willgo there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from thepotteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd theword at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of makingBirmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inhabitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments partof the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country&c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Easterncountry. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this landEearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be inthe heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford's bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousandsof people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in thegovernment they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia toto protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets beggingBread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress& it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may gothrough. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhortthe Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the presenttime & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedilythat truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-ism unveiled W Parish's letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injuryI answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vineyard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or 8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary anxious to hear from you & Sarah Emma & also about the Church around you, perhaps you mayhave written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between Missouri & Ioway, tell all the news of a National character, I herd New Orleans was destroyed by the Mississppi River is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & Commerce tell me all about it. are they publishing the times & Seasons. give my respects to all the friend[s]in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity.

I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y. also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writingof a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you mayobtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn] according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we mayenter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loomwhare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah.

 Montrose Lee County April 1st 1840Beloved WillfordI have just sent a letter to the office for you butas another oppo[r]tunity offers itself I avail myselfe of the same in writingto you, thinking you would like to know how I and my little ones get along,today our little Willford is 10 days old and I have been out of doors, and sit upthe most of the time and feal to render praise and thanksgiving to myheavenly father for all his loveing kindness to me through by life, but moreparticularly of late through my late confinement. You (probably with many others woho have called to see me) would say be careful and nottake cold or sit up to long at first, I have tried to do so. Our little Willford is a verry bright looking child with dark eyes his hair almost exactlythe colour of yours. Sarah E. is as bright as ever and highly delighted withthe babe. I often think how pleased you would be to see him and howhappy we might be with our little family if you could be at home withus–may the Lord grant that it may soon be the case. Was I surrounded by thousands I should in one sense be like the lonely dove that mournsher absent mate, who from hill, to hill, from vale, to vale, her sorrows dothrelate. As my babe lay seeping sweetly on my arm thes^e^ words came to my mindI write them just as they come to my mind.Sleep sweet babe and take thy rest,For God looks down and will the[e] bless,With all that's good, in earth, or heaven,             If thou wilt keep the commandments eleven.Sister Smoot desires the addition of Owen to our babe's name. I think that Ishall have quite a present for you when you return if we are sparedall of us to see each other. I have lately received a letter from Maine, FatherMother and sister Foss wrote in it, they they much desire a visit from you whenyou return, could you not take a ship bound for Portland instead of N.Y. and pass two or three days there, they all much regretted my not comeinghome and passing the time of your absence with them. Father tells me if I am ever in want to come to his house where I shall find an asylum – sister Foss wants you to take Ichabod if you come that way – Mother says that sheexpects to loose Shuah soon – brother Ilus is married – sister Mary failesmore and more. I have not heard from father Woodruff's family since you left.I heard that Sarah Milliken was expecting to be married to a man out of the church and likewise intemperate the sisters about here, wished me to write to heron the subject I did, mentioning sister Eliza Grants case to her but have received noI forgot that I told you about Shuah and Ilus in the forepart of my letter as I have beensometime writing it. Will. is laying looking atme as I write in my lap 
 answer – dont know but that she was offended with me for my plainness, but couldnot well help it, for I felt interested in her wellfare as we have been so intimatelyacquainted. I told you in my other letter that I had been liveing by the waysideas it were since you left me, I have moved 4 times since you, left home; that is something for one whose health was as feeble as mine. I moved from Montroseto brother Smoots, thence to my new house then to father Clarke's then into a smallhouse of his in the same door yard, just before I was confined–I chose to go there that I might be more retired. I had every thing at that time thatwas necessary to make me comfortable and have been much blest of the Lord.I missed you much more at that time than before Oh! thought I if Icould but have my Willford to call on instead of strangers what a comfortit would be to me but that time is past and over now, thank the Lord for it.Your prayer was answered in my haveing friends to stand by me when I neededthem – the brethren are verry kind about here likewise the family where I nowlive. I shall probably stay where I am untill you return – father Clark saysthat you need not be concerned about ^me^ untill you get back only pray for me,he is verry kind.Have you forgotten our hour for prayer, we have the thirdone to join us – sister Foss in Maine – she tries to observe the time & althoughfar distant from each other we have the same God to call on, woh who hearsthe prayer of his children. We know not how to appreciate blessings untillwe are deprived of them. We often see people who are permitted to live togathermen to stay at home with their families but me thinks they do not realizetheir privileges. I often look on such families around me and think how happythey must be but I suppose they do not realize it, I even look on black Jack and think if I could have my Willford live at home ^with^ me even if we had to workverry hard I should not mind or value that for then we might enjoy ourhumble pittance ^in^ each other's society which gives a relish to every blessing. You prob-ably remember our last ride togather out to brother Hawley's settlement to see ourlittle Sarah, the prairies were most delightfuly clothed with flowers and verdure and I thought it the most pleasent ride we ever had togather, the sabbathfollowing I rode out to the same place in company with a number of othersto a meeting and to see Sarah the flowers were there but they with every thingelse were dressed in gloom and looked lonely as I felt, nothing looked cheerfulbut my little Sarah, I found her health much improved which was much satisfaction to me – these with many other reflections pass and repassthrough my mind – but in the midst of them something whispers Phebedo you want your companion to come home to you before he has filled his pres-ent mission my heart answers no but Lord give me patience and a willingness to wait his return and hasten the time that he shall be returned to the bosom of his 
 family after haveing filled [hit] [misn] thy love and fear which may God grant for Chris[ts]sake.It seames to be my turn now to write to you mostly now as this is the third letter I have written you since I received any from you. I feal verryanxious to hear from you to know how you prosper in that country–hope you willtell me all about it when you write. In my last letter to you I gave you an acc-ount of my sickness likewise somethings concerning the church as correctly as I could get them, liveing at a distance from the body of the church but shall now leave it principally for the bearer of this (brother Orson Hyde) as he as more of an opportunity toknow correctly about church business than myself. The pre sent present prospect is that Congress will do nothing for our Church now as a letter from Washington haslately been received bearing that I inteligence–brother H. will probably give youthe particulars concerning it and all other church affairs I suppose. BrotherHawley has got back to his place again–brother Petty is expected back from Tennesse every day now–brother Murphy has been here from that place and wishes to be remembered to you he said he used to be acquainted with you and had quite a curiosityt to see your wilefe wife which I perceive is characterestic of all your southernfriends, I suppose they think that I am a curiosity. I must give way for your sonto write some to you. (O papa come home and see me. W.) now Sarah wants to writ[e]some to pa to. (O pa pa come home and se me and baby S.) Thus you see your [page torn]have written to you in their childlike state, Sarah cryed to write more.I had like to have forgotten to tell you that brother Ilus is married to Miss M.Sloan and Mother says she expects to loose Shuah soon. We have latelyheard that brother Willard Richards and wife was expected here soon. One ofMorris Phelpse's girls live with me now about 12 years old. Please give my respects to brother Taylor and all of the quorum who are there, likewise allof the saints there. I should like much to go and see them. The sickness has abated although many have the chills yet. I have had a number since my confinement but am better of them now–want to kn-ow how your health is–want to see you verry much. Ah! my dearWillford hasten your mission as much as you can by being faithful inthe dicharge of your duty and come home to us–tell me in your nextwhen you think of comeing home I hope next autum–that looks mostlike an age to me to look forward. I expect to write to morrow to sisterCarver if I am well enough. I received a letter from her a month sincebut have not b^e^en able to answer it yet. brother J Herrett called to see mea while since and says he thinks I had better have stayed in his family and wishes to be remembered to youI remaine as ever your true friend and companionP. W. Woodruff(Willford Woodruff)[sideways text] I sppose that all of the wives of the 12 here will write by brother Hyde. I believe they are all well

 Dec 30th With regard to the progress of the Work of the Lord in this Land it is still rolling on in all parts, & emigration is vary great. The Saints deeply feel the forebodeings of the awful judgments, distress war & tribulations which is coming like a whilrwind upon every hand. On Sunday last we had a conference in London which is the first conference we have ever held in this Metropolis. We had an interesting time 106 Saints represented most of which have imbraced the work of late, 46 in the London City Branch & the rest in the regions round about, in small Branches which we have raised up of late mostly. Their is now a fair prospect of the spread of the work in London Elder Lorenzo Snow is appointed to preside over & take charge of the churches & conference which we have esstablished in London, & the Lord has given me the desire of my heart, in seeing the work esstablished in this city, & I now feel that I can depart ^depart^ in peace I feel that my work is done in this Land & my testimony finished, or will be this week & then was it not for visiting the churches which I have built up in Herefordshire &c to get the necessary means to return &c. it should not be many days before I would be upon the sea, but I must have patience iat all times & get along as fast as I can.

 Scarborough Mar. 27th 1841Much Beloved CompanionIt is with peculiar feelings that I seat myself to acknowledge the reception of your kind letter dated Jan. 13 & 18th. It afforded me much satisfaction as I had long and anxiously been looking to hear from you—did not get your letter written Nov. 22th. The last communication but one I received fromyou was dated Oct. 31th. The last time before this I wrote you was in Dec. after I arrived in Scarborough. I should have immediately complyed with your request in answering your letter but it was so latein the month when it arrived, as you thought of starting the first of AprilI thought you would not be likely to get it. I though[t] I would sendyou a few lines to N.Y. hopeing you will get them.I said I sit down with peculiar feelings because I hope to be permittedto once more behold your face not many days after you receive this. I thinkyou will not tarry long in N.Y. (hope so at least). When I came home we left N.Y. one night and arrived at fathers the next, we came from Boston in the cars and stage as the steam-boat did not run then—it was more expensive.

 Murray. Utah. Dec. 3, 1894.Mr. Wilford Woodruff,Pres. Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.Salt Lake City.Utah.Dear Sir:Recognizing that the Gos-pel was restored to the Earththrough Joseph Smith, and that throughhim also Christ's Church was organized,does that exclude every person, not be-longing to that Church, from the ben-efits, blessings, and direct influence ofGod, and the h^H^oly Spirit? And prior tothe time of establishing that church,could any one have communionwith God or the Holy Spirit? Canpeople who pray to God and sincerelybelieve that their prayers will beanswered. – can such people, not Latter DaySaints, expect a blessing, or anyanswer to their prayers? Can they ex-pect the manifestation of God's powerin any miraculous way? Could theywork miracles? Can the reach thethrone of him who answers prayer,and be saved? Are their payers of any avail? I have my opinions butthey do not harmoize with those of my neighbor. I may not understand thematter, but I want to and therefore Ihave taken this liberty. Will you pleaseexplain it to me.Begging your pardon for this intrusionupon your time.I remain, sincerely yours.Chas. H. Wirth.

 Nauvoo March 19th 1844Col Solomon CopelandDear SirI take thismethod to break that silence which hath prevailedfor a length of time between us And also tomake a request of you of an important natureThe following reasons are some among the many thatpromps me to this course. When I was a stranger in astrange land Advocating principles of the fulness of the–everlasting Gospels of the Son of God Although as true asany principle that ever emenated from the tr^h^rone of Jehovahyet the most of all Doctrins unpopular with thatclass whose minds are limited to the sectarial notions& traditions of the present generation instead of expendingto receive the revelations of Jesus Christ which doctrine freequetlysubjected me with my friends to unfair opposstion persecutionwarrents &c It was in the midst of this order of things thatI found Col Solomon Copeland among the first to step forthas a Gentleman, friend & Republican to assist us in maint-aning our rights & ^you^ not ownly treated me & my friendswith common civility & sociability But all of ourwants were bountifuly supplyed under your hospitableroof. This Sir was not all I discovered that whenever anyprinciple was presented that was high, Noble, & glorious thatwhen carried out would have a tendency to ennobleman & exhalt him to the highest grade ^degree^ of usefulness, 
 intelligence & glory that was ever designed for man by theGod of heaven that it would strike a cord & vibrate yoursoul as with the rapidity of light[n]ing yea the silent Languageof which was, this is congenial with my spirit & the sentimentsof my heart. And whenever in my perigrinations I havemet with any master spirits of this kind I have markedit in my mind & laid it up in my memory fora future day, permit me Sir to say that inasmuchas you are one of the most prominant ones with whi[c]hI have met in my travels I feel disposed to express mymind freely to you upon the subject which I havein view. Sir Those primary principle appertaining to theKingdom of God & the salvation of man which we taughtin our spiritual Infancy & in which you seemed to takea deep interest are of no less consequence now than therein fine evry day that rolls over our heads adds to its mag-nitude & importance for whenever any great & Noble purposework or plan is put into operation its light & influenceis seen & felt more & more by the Nations of the EarthMuch Sir has been said concerning us as a people, ourmotives & principles have all the day long been misrepresentedby wicked & designing men. We as a people are not known inour true light I would to God we were I would to Godthat president Joseph Smith was known in his true lightto all the wise, the good, the virtuous, the meek & the hone[s]t in heart & they would be lauded by a portion of the same spiritthat is like fire shut up in his bones He ownly kneed to be knownby men to be haled as one born out of due time to frownupon oppession, plead the cause of the opp[r]essed, as the universal 
 friend of man, to introdu[c]e Intelligence & wisdom into theworld, To raise a standard of light & truth as a Ban[n]erto the Nations of the Earth that time nor man canotextinguish or destroy. He has thus far by the Help of God out-rode the storm of persecution heaped upon him by his enemieswho have saught to take away from ^him^ evry right that the Laws& Constitution garantee unto him as well as evry Americ[a]ncitizen, his course has been onward in the midst of evrydifficulty untill he has erected one of the largest cities ofthe west ^containing a population of some 15 or 20,000 souls^ and is surrouded not ownly with the ^best^ intelligence& wisdom of the Earth as his council but with thousandsof friends who would in a moment ^if necssary^ lay down their li^v^vesin his defen[c]e against oppression & mobs, & as the timehas arived when we deem it no longer necessary to putmen in office to use our influence in promoting mento the highest offices of this government who will not act forthe good of the people but for their own aggrandizement & party purposes. And we as a people have come to the ^conclusion^ conclusionto run a candidate for president of the United States at thenext election And that candidate is General Joseph Smith.And sirs the request I wish to make of you is to know if you are willing to permit us to use your name as acandidate for vice president at the next elec^t^ion &also to invite you to p^f^avor us with a visit at NauvooI make this request of your honor according to the cou[n]cilof the Authorities of the City of Nauvoo, and we should be Happyto see you & you will meet with a welcome receptionin our midst & I think Sir you would Be amply 
 ^repaid^ in your feelings for taking a journey of this kind; Itrust Sir you will favor me with an answer to this the earliest opportunity.

Learning, however, that the custom has been stopped for obvious reasons, I would respectfully ask, if it meet with your approval, that my mission be changed to England. I have to offer as a reasonfor preferring this request that I have alarge number of relatives in that country and desire to hunt up genealogies inconnection with my labors in dissem-inating the principles of the Gospel.  awaiting an early reply, I remainYours Truly,A.

 Salt Lake City, Utah, Jany 15th /1889.Prest Woodruff and members of the Twelve Apostles:Dear Brethren:–On Saturday last the 12th inst, I received a copy of a con:joint report made by two committees, one appointed by yourselvesand one by the Board of Directors of Z.C.M.I., whose duty it was toinvestigate the merits of propositions to be made by me lookingto the inauguration of a company for the production andmanufacture of Sugar in this Territory.If the Brethren had seen fit, before they made their report, tohave accorded to me even one opportunity of laying before themin Board assembled the information correspondence and corrob-orative evidence at my command, I would have esteemedit as a courteous kindness to me, and a respectful apprecia-tion of the Powers at whose instance and in whose behalf theyacted, and of the importance of the business to be discussed,and I feel assured that the recommendation contained inthe latter part of their report would not have been made.I thank you respectfully for having appointed said committee 
 and express my regret that the circumstances in which you are placed render it impossible for you to extendfinancial aid (which however my understanding of the positionforbade me to expect at present), nevertheless I hope thatthe portion of said committee's report indicating the advisabilityof a postponement to another year will not prevent yourgiving moral support to myself and other friends of theIndustry who are entering upon the inauguration of the enter-prise the present season, and if it be not asking too muchI respectfully solicit that in acting upon the report of thecommittee you specify that your sympathy for and moralsupport of this movement shall be accorded.Permit me to say for myself and the brethren who are associa-ting for the inauguration of the Industry referred to, that wesee in it (and of its success we are substantially convinced)and the saving of the immense amount of money now expendedand the large profits that will certainly result, the gratifyingpossibility of strengthening and establishing other industrieswhich shall be made to afford or furnish appropriate labourto large numbers of workmen of various trades & manufactures,many of whom are now but partially employed and thatin labour to which they have not been accustomed.We see that there must be an advanced state of prosperity 
 for the people at large before they can avail themselves of thesuperior advantages for Education which it is in your minds tointroduce, for to many thousands of our brethren in theirpresent condition and circumstances the proffer of these oppor-tunities for proper and advanced Education would be asthe tempting viands placed before, but just beyond the reach of,the mythological Tantalus. Surely to retain symmetry inthe growth of the Tree of God's planting the temporal, as wellas the spiritual, should partake of the elements of suitableand consistent nourishment.For the sake of the principles involved, and that thenation may not have to answer for the gross and unwarrant-able robbery and persecution, vastly more than for theproperty in question. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court willrender judgment in favor of the Church in the suits nowpending in WashingtonRespectfully submittedYour Brother in the GospelArthur  Stayner

I do hope, that I will not be

Fredrick Jensen Holt, of Ephraim desires to go back to Denmark as a miss-ionary, both to preach and also to obtainhis geneology, as far as he can.His age is sixty-four past, not muchcalculated to preach. He is a widower,two daughters, but both are married,means very limited. He is an inoffensivegood Later-day Saint. His most ardentdesire to go back is to obtain his genologyas he is the only one of the family.I have rather discouraged him littleand advised him to obtain ^it^ throughbrethren who are already there in the field, and that he might defraythe expenses for the same. He feels(over) 
 that a word from you, either in favor or against his going, wouldsatisfy him.In our last talk, I promised I would write to you on the subject.He desires to go with the brethren thatleave after April Conference, if youconsider it allright.Please excuse me for troubling youwith this matter.Your Brother in the Gospel,Canute Peterson

WoodruffDear Brother,I received your letter of29 Dec. 1888 the day after,calling me on a mission toNorway, to leave SaltLake 9th April 1889 &calso your favor of 20th inst.to day, which I will try toanswer, the reason I have notdone it before is that Iwaited for our Bishop tocome home from the pen.My feelings with regard tothis call are as I stated in my former letter, good, andI am willing to go on theday appointed, but I can not see how I can get themeans. I stated in my 
 letter before, that I did nothave any money to startthe journey with, nothingto make these winter monthsand a large family. I statedin my last that I have 2 sonsthat would be a great help to thefamily in my absense, if theLord would bless them withhealth and profitable employ-ment, but it would ^be^ unnat-ural to expect that they couldtake the whole burden and goright along with it, and providefor the family without mater-ial assistance. I thereforeask if the time could be ex-tended a few months, whichwould give me a chance tostraighten up some finan-cially, and be better preparedto help myself, but in casethat something should turn up in my favorbetween now and April 9ththat would enable me togo, then I will try and reportmyself in time. I hateto have to be so humble,but it seems to be my lot.Will you please answerthis as soon as you can andoblige your brother inthe GospelO. H. OlsenBp George Halliday

 Add: Springville Jan. 8th 90.Utah Co U.T.Wilford Woodruff Esq.Dear Sir!The situation your Church is in, andas you are the head of that Church; your situation is at present extremly precarious,I have a scheme to offer you, that would makeyou and your Church triumph and gain a completeVictory, and I garrantee that Utah would be-come a state within five years if you manipu-late this scheme as I will tell you. I am surpris-ed you have not hit upon it long before now,it is not against the principles of your faith; andand is nothing worse than what your people votedfor in the late Constitution, yet the scheme is suchthat the Gentiles can not possibly discover the trickat all, if you but have from 25 to 50 thousand of your people you can depend upon; that would doas you tell them, when you first get to hear it youwill be extremely glad as it will save you from de-struction and disgrace, and would cause all of your 
 people have unbounded confidence in yourself,and it would bring tens of thousands of peopleinto your Church, because they would think you in-spired indeed, and it would be worth untold milli-ons of dollars into the Church treasury.This is not overdrawn as you yourself knows thatif Utah became a State, that such would be theprestige you would have, that the above wouldresult; and if you but will carry out my scheme,Utah is bound to be a state in a few years atmost. I have no possible interest in yourChurch, as I look upon it as a fraud "from the word go." but if you will pay me handsomely,say: $200,000 00/100 I will tell you said scheme,if you do not act upon this you have better make up your mind to: that your Church willgo to destruction because of the failures of SmithsProphesies, but if Utah becomes a state thosefailures will be forgotten.But if you conclude to undertake this schemeit must be kept absolutely secret, exept tothose initiated, if it becomes public it willfail. If you a⬦ accept my offier I am willing 
 for you to bind me as tight in writing as youlike, but one fifth must be paid down before I tell it. There will be no more expencesto pay for Lawyers, ect. to go to Washingtonto fight for your cause, as it will be smoothsailing into the Union. I am willing to giveyou a bond to the effect, that if you do asI tell you, and Utah do not become a statewithin five years, that I will refund youthe money paid me.Please write and tell me if you will un-dertake this matter, will you come to seeme? That would be best. Please rememberthat often it is the obscure in this worldthat is the best inventors.My ideas are too valueable to give themaway. I live at mouth of Maple Canyon,Springville Utah CoYours RespectfullyCh. E. Malmström.

 Cleveland May 13.th 1896President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, UtahDear BrotherI received a call from you, dated the 6th Inst to go on a mission to Iceland. In reply would say,I consider it my duty to respond, when I am calledto do eney thing in this Church, as far as it is ^in^ mypower, and will except the call providing I havea good partner to go with me, as you want to kno-w my feeling in regards to the call, I will tryto say a few words on the same. For me to ask fora good partner is becaus I am very poor in thelanguage. I came to this country when I was only6 year old, have not studied the language asI should have done. I can speck partly but cannot read or write the same. I realise that it willbe hart for me to ^go^ into a strange country without an exsperenced missionary. I hope that youwill not exspect me to. I would like to get a manthat is pretty well posted in the Iceland languageand one that knew the country a little. If thair wasa missionary thair now. which I could go to work with as it is in other places I would not askwhat I do. My curcumstances is not as goodas I would like them to be I have a Father andMother about 70 years of age to take care of, anda baby 6 months old. its mother died 5 monthsago. I will need some help in from the ward ina financial way. but will help my self all 
 I can. I am very thankful to you for the lengthof time you have given me to prepare in. I am surethat the Lord will turn thing in my favor, withhis help I will be at the Historians Office at theapointed time ul^n^less sickness or death hindersme. these few words was on my mind so I thoughtI would write them.Your Brother in the GospelJohn J ThordersonL.

Woodruff. Beloved & Affectionate BrotherIt is under peculiar circumstances & amid peculiar feelings that I take up my pen to once more address you & perhaps troubleyou because of the length of it. But Brother Asahel bear with me this once come now lay aside your Books and convers awhile withWillford I have much I wish to say to you perhaps you may be interested in some of it. I have thought that I have been burthensome to you in some of my letters since we saw each other as I have not receieved much of any answer from you perhaps theyhave contained to much what the world calls mormonism to have been of any interest to you. But as I have been visiting ourfriends I thought it might be interesting to you in some degree to know sumthing about it whare I have been the whys & the wharefores&c. & I wish to write to you jut as I would talk as easy & simple as truth itself whether it is grammatical or not in or outof measure. I am not polished in what the world calls learning (anyhow) But I desire to convers considerable with you now & ifI am troublesome tell me of it & I will do better for the future I have had a happy visit with my friends Ill now tell you about itI left Kirtland the 31st of May & took water at fairport & arived atSyracuse on the third of June the day following I arived at Brother Azmonsin Richland. I had not time to tarry but a short time with them. I was truly gladto see them once more they were generally enjoying good ^health^ I think excepting Elizabeth whichwas not vary good I ownly spent one night among them Thompson looked natural as ever heworks hard they looked slick around the farm. Cousin Eldad was with them he left for Con-necticut the morning I left for Canida. I went to Sackets Harbor from thence toKingston took the canal up to Joneses falls we past though four locks that cost $100,000each said to be the most splendid works in America. After attending a conference inCanida I returned to Oswego from thence to Albany. to Canaan to Colebrookfather had mooved his family the day before I arived I called at the rock schoolhouse three or four times to visit Sister Eunice I do not know that I cangive you a description of my visit with her any better than to copy a page frommy journal which I wrote upon the subject which is as follows[FIGURES]June 21st 1837. In Colebrook I wrap'd at a school house door itopened by a female hand, and lo it was a sister, yes sister Euniceindeed. We saluted each other with a harty shake of the hand [shorthand]I conversed with her a few moments with joy, and retired.June 28 th at 11 oclock AM I entered the school tought by sisterEunice, five hours I spent within its walls amid as great varietyof sensations as ever vibrated my bosom. I beheld my sister myownly sister, seventeen years of age adorned with youth, modesty,and lovliness with her face veiled with the true picture of PHILO.with a degree of admiration I gazed upon the change five yearshad brought upon HER. HER sprightly step with energy was markedwhile teaching the youth. To more perfectly call to mind the recollection of youth and past scenes & to entertain my mind amid thepassing hours, this sister presented me (with a cheerful grace) abundle of Letters from an absent brothers I looked them throughand through they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy lettersI read fifteen in number to Eunice directed. They brought to mysoul as great a variety of feeling as matter they contained.They presented to my view, the display of a cultivated mind& the refined talents of a brother presented to a sister withthe most untarnished friendship and deepest feeling for her wel-lfare that can grace the human soul. Such teachings as theseto Eunice directed if followed by the female youth woulddeliver them from a thousand snares. The name of Willfordwas mentioned oft Asahel had not forgotten him. (O heaven protect my Parents my Brethren & my sister) While at once I viewedthis three years convers of Asahel, I smiled, I wept.Eunice preserve those in memory of a brothers love, regardthese teachings they will lead thee in the paths of safty. I leftthe house and by my sisters side I viewed the Colebook land-scapes as we walked. my soul was pressed. O I spake ofAsahel, I thought of him, I asked what he would say if he knewwhare we were. ah says Eunice he would wish to be here. Wevisited our parents dwelling at sages mill, but they had goneto Farmington we entered the, house and found all as emty,vacant, silent & still as death. Not a parent or brother to salute, we entered the chamber & saw the work of Asahels handsbut nothing left but a stick balanced by a string in the closetto hold his coat. it was to gloomy to tarry long I droped a tearand retired believing it more pleasent on the banks of theWabash or Missouri I took a drink from the well while depart-ing Eunice plucked each of us a, rose as we left we walked upthe hill while the stones, stumps, hills & dales, looked natural.We was soon kindly received by Mr. Jonathan Stillmans houshold took a seat at his board and sup'd together which closedthe scene. HOW pleasing and how painful are the scenes of LIFEJuly 4th INDEPENDANCE how can I enjoy the better than tovisit a lonely sister thought I, so a steed I mounted at Canaanto visit Eunice but when I arived she was ^x^ gone to a saleing ^x^ [sailing]party on a pond I rode near to it as I approached they crossedfrom me I hoisted a flag in token of friendship they discoveredit & bow'd to my notice but knew not that it was Willfordas the watery element wafted them from my sight behind agrove I bowed saying GOD save my sister [shorthand]

 is progressing rapidly in the earth. I want to say a few words to you about the causeI am engaged in & the course I am persuing. I am sensible we ought to be care-ful what we put on paper & send abroad & I have at times thought I was not sufficientlycareful upon this subject, lest even friends draw wrong views & conceptions frommy writings & to save any thing of this nature even from your mind & wish here tomake a remark. ie. since my first conncetion with the Latter Day Saints I havebeen happy, contented, & satisfied. I know & bear testimony in the name of JesusChrist that the Book of mormon is the revealed will of God, & also that Joseph Smith jris a prophet of God, & that the Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts &graces. I know the same signs now follow the believers that did anciently & as I haveprooven this work & know it to be true for myself, I am entirely unshaken in its work& in consquence of this, my soul being wrap'd in the work, when I have written to anyof my friends (yourself not excepted) I have principly written upon the subject& this is why I say, perhaps I have been to tegious [tedious] in my letters to you. But Ido not wish to burthen any, of my friends in this or any other way. my ownly motivefor not writing to Azmon more than I have since I have been travling, was becauseI thought they might not be entertaining to him at this time. I have written vary plainto Azmon in one Letter it is true, But I have nothing in my breast against himor any relatives I have in the world. Again I receieved a letter from you lastwinter wishing to correspond with me & you wished to know all about my temporalmatters I set down & write you one or two vary full letters, I told you,about my entering some land in Missouri this land I entered at congress prise pi◊◊pir acre I ownly entered 40 acres for an inheritance or home, this money was apresent from some friends in N. Y. the Land now I suppose is worth $10 or $15dollars per acre as it is near the county seat. I also speak of our safety fund thatI took some shares in that, now why I speak of this is, I did not know but you mightdraw the idea that I had left the gospel & gone to speculating but this is not the case. I feelthat the spirit that rolls in my veins is steadfast upon the subject, & I shall go tho to the gulentine, faggot,or death before I shall renounce it the reason of this remark is because I know it to be true. Butenough upon this subject at this time. Now Brother Asahel for heavens sake do not thinkthat I have drop'd a remark in this letter to cast any reflections upon you or anybody els I have none to cast. Shall it be said that we must be seperated in feelings & [other]ties of consanguinity severed because we may not think alik[e] upon religious subjectslet God forbid, I love you. I respect you, I have never had cause to do otherwi[se]& I trust I never shall. I thank kind heaven that I have a Brother whose interestis manifest for the welfare of Eunice & our Parents. Brother Asahel throw a cloakof charity over my imperfections Letters from you will ever meet a well come recep-tion from my hand. If I live I some expect to leave this Continent for Europeanother season should it or should it not be the case it will be a great pleasureto me to receieve letters from you from time to time I feel interested in your wellfareboth temporal & spiritual watch the signs of the times remember you have sucha brother as Willford in the world if we do not see each other before we will soon standin the presence of God. your parents send their respects to you, mother says she will write to you againsoon.

 Terre Haute Feb 8 1838.Dear brotherI received your truly interestingletter of 5th January two days since and I am happy in improvingan early opportunity to reply. I perused your letter of Nov20th to Don C Smith published in the "Elders Journal" withmuch satisfaction. The account you gave of your ministryupon the "Island of the Sea" in that communication togetherwith other particulars in your last letter to me enables me toform a pretty just estimate of the result of your labors. I am happymy beloved brother to assure you that I rejoice in the success ofthose ministers of the gospel of the Son of God who are not ashamedto declare the truth in opposition to popular error. And althoughI confess myself an incompetent judge of the merits of the "faith"of the "Latter Day Saints" as a system of religion yet, I entertainan erroneous impression if the struggle between popular secta--rianism ^(2)^ and "Mormonism" ^(1)^  is not a strife between libertyof speech and toleration in religious opinion and theirantipodes – dumb sevility servility to the prejudices ofeducation and the trammels of an illiberal bigotry.You make some allusion to the "reserve" and "distain" of someof your friends on account (as you suppose) of your oddreligious profession. That the deportment of some of them shouldbe affected in some degree by this circumstance seems to me verynatural and indeed when we consider how very inconvenientit is for most persons under the circumstances to appreciateproperly the character and motives of the "Saints" it isreasonable to expect themat many will turn up their noses andmake wry faces. I do not however suppose that in thecare of your early acquaintances you have just grounds fordoubting their respect and confidence for as far as I amacquainted with their views they give you much creditfor your devotion to such a cause. There is perhapsnothing cause from ^by^ which we are so much anoyed inthe world as the misconstructions that are put upon 
 our actions thus we are continually misunderstoodand consequently our motives are misappreciated (if Imay manufacture a term). I am apt to imagain thatthe world is not half so bad as it appears to be thoughI must confess my conviction that many persons arefar worse than they seem. We do not know the motivesby which men are governed in their intercouse with usand hence when their conduct is [opposed] to our wishesand interest we set them down as bad men, whileperhaps at the same time they are only opposing toour selfish views the purest principles of their integrityIn refference to your leaving Richland and joining the "Mormons"I received my first impression either directly or indirectlyfrom brother Azmon [than] whom not even yourself couldhave felt a deeper interest in a [pernniary] point of viewHe was grieved and his friends sympathised with hissorrow and I in the tenderness of my heart con◊oled withhim. I reflected upon your conduct – and passed sentenceof unqualified condemnation uupon it. In letters bothto Azmon and to friends at home I took occasion toallude to the matters and I spoke of you leaving in termsof reproach! I would not conceal from you thatI thought you had done foolishly or even wickedly. Iwould not recall those thoughts. I do not even wishthey had not occurred for they stand an [evidence]of my honesty and sincerity. And what is my apology?You will find it in the imperfection of human nature.And in appealing to you for your charity – to your brotherfor his confidence. I have no doubt I shall meet aready response. And formy folly I hesitate not tobelieve you will both find an excuse in my apology.It was silly in me to make the remarks I did aboutthe Letter from England for really I had no

 Scarborough Maine May 2nd 1838Dear BrotherWhile the Sun is shedding its beams to gladdenearth I sit down beneath a fathers roof in company with mycompanion to address a few lines to you. My last was datedMarch Vinalhaven Maine that sheet was principally occupied with thefeelings of my mind upon things future. I would here remark thata person situated as I am in life & calling knows not whare the morrowwill find him at all times. I have of late held two conferences inVinalhaven one upon each Island & organized a Church in each placeboth containing about fifty members & so they are now in a situationto attend to their meetings without me I have concluded to leavethem for a season & in consequence of recieving some intelligenceof interest from the City of New York from Elder P. P. Pratt & othersI have concluded to take a mission that way for two or three months Ishall probably visit Lynn, Boston, Holliston, & N Y City as we have [Members]in these places. The work of the Lord is progressing with great rapidity & power in the City of N Y. under the preaching of Elder Pratt he is now Baptizingin the city by day & night he has the use of two meeting houses & alsoTammany's Hall the most noted Hall in the City which is freely furnished andadvertized at the expens of the Infidels as the Priests are disposed to call themthe work is spreading in the county as well as City some come 20 or 30 milesto hear and obey the gospel & the calls are more numerous than they can possiblyattend to. As to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts[,] thePriests many of them rage and foam & go to such lengths that every honestman is under the necessity of coming out from them. The Saints are firmin the City & are ready to suffer death for Christs sake & the truths. I do notknow the number Baptized in the City Elder Pratt writes in his last that 75 have beenadded & that the work has but just begun & sayes we are crouded beyond conception- two pamphlets & many papers are filled against us but all tends to give usthe attention of the people The Editor of the Zions Watchman is vary busy against us & his paper is teeming with falshood & misrepresentation. I have answered him 
 in a pamphlet of 42 pages which I want circulated whareever theZions Watchman has gone those with many other things sayes Elder PrattAs our printing Office is burned I am well aware that those opposed to us insentiment will make every exertion to prejudice the minds of communitybefore we are in a cituation to answer them but I expect the Elders Journalwill soon be issued from the press at the City far West Mo There is someindividuals that have been cut off from the Church in Kirtland (by the voiceof the Church) which are making as great an exertion against us as any of theworld W Parrish is their leader; but the work of God still rolls on in spiteof all their falshoods & misrepresentations.I have just arived at FatherCarter's from the Islands I shall leave in few days for the City of N. Y. incompany with Elder Milton Holmes a Brother that I highly essteem I havetraveled with him thousands of miles we have passed through sufferings & trialstogether as well as enjoyed many happy seasonsI wish here to remark that as I may not be stationary at present that I wish you to direct yourcommunications to Scarborough Maine those that you send to meat present perhaps you may have sent one letter to Vinalhaven that I havenot yet recieved if so I expect it will be remailed to me & forwarded to ScarboroughMrs Woodruff will remain here at her fathers house until we go west in the fall &she will attend to all letters sent me she is enjoying comfortable health & wishes tobe remembered to you. I am still enjoying good health. I am expecting tobe gone about two months on my journey to N Y. & it is my present intentionto visit our friends in Connecticut before I return. I have not herd fromany of them for a length of time. I have not much temporal news tocommunicate to you at this time business is exceding dull in this countysome of the Banks are resuming specie payment most of them I think will soonexcept the rotten ones which are numerous. This state are waking up as to theirpolitical matters they are determined to redeem themselves from their lastyears negligence which I think they will do. Their is a company of Saintsexpect to accompany me from fox Islands to the far west in Sept nextshould you come east this spring I should be happy to meet youin Connecticut at our Fathers House 
 When you write to me give me the inteligence you have from any ofour friends which would be greatfully recieved. I have recieved the papersfrom your City which you sent me from time to time I learnedfrom your last that Terre Haute was an incorporated City & that you& Mr Smith had dissolved pardonship & that you was carrying onyour business alone I wish you much success in all lawful& honorable undertakings & I have no reason to suppose thatyou will be [FIGURE] engaged in any other. I would suppose that yourtinde of business would increase & hold as good as any trade in thatcountry as the tide of emigration is constant & without doubtwill continue to increase. I am pleased with the Idea of yourlocating yourself so far west & I wish more of our friends werein the western country for the west must increase while the eastdecreases in my view. I could not be contented to locate myself& till the earth in New England but should delight in it in the westI presume you are closely confined to your business as yourare now alone & perhaps you do not think of visiting the east [page torn]at present. I should be happy to visit our Parents & Sister [once]. [page torn]I often feel sorry for our Father considering his age & how hard he has to work in old connecticut alone without any of his Children to visithim or Mother I expect they have many gloomy hours thinking aboutit But so it is time makes a great seperation & changes with a gener-ation. I should be glad to hear from them & know how they getalong. I intend to write a letter to them as soon as I finish this SheetI want to hear from Eunice & know whare she is & what she is doingI have not yet heard any thing from Azmon, Thompson, or the family.if you get any word from any of them I should be glad to have yousend it to me when you write.As ever yours withRespect & essteemW WoodruffA H.

 Farmington June 26th 1838Dear BrotherI have passed through such a variety of scenes, time,places, change, events, & experience since I last wrote, & my mind is now impressedwith so much I wish to communicate that I hardly know whare to begin, or what to say. As I sat down to write in company with Mother, Sister Eunice, & Aunt Cossett. bythe N.W. window of our kitchen a little putty [pretty] bird came & lit on the window caseby the side of my hand bearing a feather in his mouth & he tried to take hold of my penwith his bill, what this omen is I know not, whether the bird had a message to you or what hisobject could have been remains yet to be revealed I am not verry superstitious concerningsuch matters & I leave the subject & haste to my business. I have had an interesting journeythrough the eastern sea board towns since I last wrote you. after visiting a number of towns& churches I arived at the city of Boston it being the ^[my]^ first time visit to the city of coursI spent some time in visiting the different parts of it I went to the top of the splendidState House & paid some attention to most of the objects that would be of interestto common historians I walked about Bunker Hill monument & in fine Ispent a busy day in visiting Boston, Charleston, Cambridge, &c. with the exceptionof a few hours of the latter part of the day & part of the night following I was closlyconfined with locks, bolts, & bars, in Cambridge goal, not for crime but Iwent in voluntarily to comfort an Elder of Israel that was cast into prison ahwilefor dept [debt]. I spent several days in Boston and preached several times among the Saints in thecity & I found the church there firm in the faith after visiting Holliston I took steemBoat at Providence & traveled by water to the city of N.Y. of cours I saw manythings to interest me here The shipping, the city, the rich, the poor & the market mademe think of Babylon ^x^ more then any thing els. I had a glorious ^time^ here with the Saintsthe work of God was progressing rapidly I spent several days in this great city & pre-ached several [it] times to the people. Our Elders had just returned to NY. from Englandthey brought cheering intelligence they had Baptized about 2000 & ordained 100 Elders &the work was progressing rapidly when they left. After spending a few days in the city Itook steam Boat for Newburg on North river from there I walked 40 miles westto Westtown & Greenville the people here flung open their public houses, Academies, S^c^hoolhouses, private houses, &c. & I preached about 10 days to the won⬦dering multitude 
 & quite a number manifested their faith in the work & several offeredthemselves for Baptism but it was finally omitted for a season & 9 fondly leftwithout Baptism any in the places but I sowed the seed some of which will bringforth fruit I next traveled by land to Farmington & was againjoyfully receeved at a Fathers House I have often wished I could have had yourcompany while on this visit. I never have enjoyed a visit of my fathers housemore agreeable than this, every thing looks more natural at home at this timethan it did last season. Father works hard. Uncle Ozem was sawing shinglesfor father last week. I have spent most of my time at Fathers since my return.I have preached several times since I returned to my fathers house. I have generallyhad full attendance, some are believing the fulness of the gospel. Last friday Iwent out to Uncle Adna's; I found a bea tree on the way, I showed Adna where it was.I had an interview with Aunt Hannah, she is better in health, but does not yet have herreason. I spent the night with Uncle Thadeus, next Day I saw grandmother Thompson& Abie. Also Michael, Woodruff, little Joseph Hart, Uncle Aseph Woodford, Michael Bouler, cousins Caltha, Eldad, Lavilla, Uncle Titus, Capt's Francis & Erastus ^[{shorthand}]^ Woodruff, Adna& Silus, Julius Fuller, & Mirah, after spending the day visiting such folks all looking natural I spent the night with Uncle Alson Thompson. I preached twice Sunday inthe Lovely Street Schoolhouse to an attentive congregation. Cousin Horace Wwas present, I had a talk with him, I dismissed the meeting & bid them farewell &perhaps for the last time, & walked down to Adna's with Ozem, & I preached there at5 oclock to a congregation from Cider Brook Baldwin, [Eb[enezar & Harlow Miller, &c. I retreturned to fathers with Aunt Cossett. I have an appointment at Fathers next Sunday& some are going forward in Baptism Aunt Cossett for one. I shall leave on Mondayfor Maine. Asahel I want to say a great Deal to you about Eunice and Mother thereminds &c. & Father but you see I cannot now, I never saw Eunice in a better stateof mind than now, I am troubled with weak eyes or I should have written more & oftener.what destruction there is among the steam Boats. & it appears some like war to. w^W^rite to mewhen you receeve this & direct to Scarborough Maine.

 [Eunice Hart Woodruff Webster]Farmington.Brother Asahel,I suppose you have given up the idea by this time of ever hearingdirectly from me again, but I can tell you brother, that nothing but a multiplicityof business, would have caused this long delay, and in fact I have for a few weekspast had no time comparatively speaking but what has been devoted to ^necessary^ householdaffairs, have not retired to rest much of the time before midnight, and arise at4 or 5 in the morning, and you must be aware I think, that after laboring quitehard so many hours in the day. I must of course, become weary, and consequentlynot in much of a writing mood, but the above apologies, bungling as theyare must for the present suffice.I have, now, Asahel, a privilege which I have never before been favoredwith, and may never be again viz. that of addressing a few lines to you uponthe same sheet with Brother Willford. you have learned of course by Willfordscommunication that he is now at his fathers house in Farmington, a few morningsago, after breakfast, says I to mother, "I will get the front room in order, forWillford will be here to day I guess."  I accordingly did, and paraded the [wax seal]in the afterpart of the day, and about four oclock, I cast my eyes out of the [wax seal]window, and to my astonishment shall I say, when I was expecting it, saw thewell known form of my Brother. I suppose it would be needless for me to express our happiness in seeing him. for you are well aware that your fathers sons would everrecieve a hearty welcome from Father, Mother, Sister, &c. I have so much that Iwant to say to you that I very much fear I shall not say any thing of any consequencewe have had uncomonly pleasant visit with Willford so far, and ^are^ especially pleasedwith his christian character, which is in perfect accordance with the word of God, and ^as^ formyself after striving with the assistance of the spirit of God to investig[at]e the subject, which is lookedupon by the worlds people, (and even those who consider themselves no more of the world) I [very][looked] with contempt, permit, me to say, (by being brief) that I have "viz thatof Mormonism to be brief permit me to say I have concluded, [the work], and that too I think ^know^ by thespirit of God) to be from the Lord, and of coure according unto the word,Willford has mentioned you I think, of the intended Baptism next sabbath. I reallymost want to go forward with others to recieve the ordinance and ^would^ you Dear Brotheradvise me not too supposing I felt it to be a duty incumbent upon me! I tell youwhat Asahel, I feel satisfied in my own mind, that I shall never enjoy morereligion, if I am not willing to bear the cross and take up on me the name ofChrist. would you for the fleeting honor and pleasures of this transitory world wishyour only sister to barter, her souls salvation for the same, no. I am sure youwould not, and have confindence in you to believe, that in all the anxiety you havefor your sister, you endeavor to keep her best good in view.[sideways text] You see how it is sheet filled over, and I but just begun, to express my feelings.Aunt Cossetts respects to Asahel, have 7 or 8 in our family about all of the timehave two regular boarders, young men that boarded with us last fall, work atthe Methodist meeting house.

I remarked in my last that I shouldwrite again if I had any thing of interest to communicate. & so I have finished my visit with my friends in Conn" for the present at least.I thought it might not be amiss to inform you about matters and thingsJuly 8th I visited our relatives in west street uncle Thadeus Thompsonfamily & all the friends who appeared glad to see me. I spent the night withUncle Titus Woodruff. I found them all well. Sunday 9th I visited UncleOzem Woodruff & was truly rejoiced to once more take him by the handI preached at early candele light at the Lovly Street School house byUncle Ozem's to a full congregation of relatives, neighbours, & old acquaint-ance they gave good attention & treated me with the best of friendship[s] Ispent the night with Uncle Alson Thompson. 10th I visited Collinsville & found the place had altered much since I lift [left] it, it was dull timeswith them no business going on excepting pulling down their shops& building greater they were making about $100,000 dollars of repairs. I spent the day in visiting the place Uncle Ozem was at work onthe stone dam across the river cousin Samuel Barber was treading & doing well. I preached in the city hall at 5 oclock PM. to the inhabitants ofCollinsville as I commenced speaking the drums commenced beatingat the door's which continued for half an hour, their was some tumultin the house, however I preached them the word. Some few gave goodattention such as Samuel Barber, Uncle Ozem, & (Jerry Humiston) ^xx^who were present. I again preached on the 11th in the Lovly Street School house upon the Authenticity of the Book of mormon theirprejudice was broaken down they gave good attention & found no faultquite a number were quite believeing & three offered themselvesfor Babtism I suppose I must tell you who they were vizOzem Woodruff. Hannah Woodruff & John Woodruff their SonI repaired to the water & baptized them with great joy & consolation to my soul (thus ends that dream or vision which I had in Avonwhen about ten years of age). On the 12th I went to Simsbury tovisit Aunt Cossetts family I had a very plesant visit with them 
 I found them all enjoying good health, Aunt Bulah not accepted.I was made wellcome not withstanding my principles which mayappear to be dreadfull in the eyes of many of my friends untill they have a true understanding of the matter but as soonas they have this privilege the direfull veil is rent from their eyes& they no longer consider Willford such a fated, desperate, & dreadful monster or sunk in the lowest depths of vice darkness, error degradation & infamy. I would to God that every relative I havewere such as I am this day as touching spiritural things. Aunt Cossettshousehold receieved my teachings & the word & spirit bare record to thetruth I had but a short time with them I spent one night & took theparting ^hand^ with them next day. 14th I again visited our Fathers hous inFarmington whare I had a happy privle interview not ownly with ourparents but also Sister Eunice who had come home to visit me & mywife while at our fathers house. I ownly had time to take supper withthem & then returned to Avon & spent the night at Uncle ThadeusThompson's.  15thI preached again at the School house by Uncle Ozems16th Sunday I preached at Uncle's Adna Harts to a congregationcomposed of my relatives & former Neighbour ma^n^y from Cider Brookthis was the last meeting I held in Avon. my stay among my friendswas of necessity much shortedr than I could have wished. after the meetingclosed I took the parting hand for the last time with many of our relativesUncle Ozem. Cousin John. & Horatio. & many others I might name among them. Iemployed Solomon Willcox to convey my friends to farmington those thathad come out to attend the meeting such as Mother, Sister Eunice, & Phebemy wife this was the first meeting they had attended of mine & after I arivedat my fathers house. I concluded to spend the rest part of the time in visitingthe old folks, & a happy visit it was to considering the shortness of it beingthree days ownly. I took several walks with Eunice & Phebe they seemto enjoy themselves well together we walked upon the canall & looked about theriver whare we [hole burned in paper] u[se]d to fish when we were boys. it looked verry natural. I hearmany enquiries about Asahel wherever he is known. On the 17th MissMary Ann Hills called to pay us a visit. she spent the afternoon & took tea with usshe made enquiries about Asahel & seemed to be anxious to learn of his wellfare.18th  I wrote an Acrostic for Eunice in her Abbum to remember me by. she isreserving a page for you to write when you come home. I am now holding a penknife in my left hand that you found on the river bank & sold to me about fifteenyears ago I keep it to remember you by & for the good it has done {shorthand} l l Europe 
 {shorthand} you {shorthand}NB 19th I gave out an appointment for preaching in the Methodist meeting houseon the public square in Farmington at early candle light thepeople had but about two hour's notice & their was a thunder storm duringthe time so that the congregation was not as large as it probable otherwisewould have been, besides the Prysbeterians had a prayer meeting at the sametime. but notwithstanding these things two hundred or rising of the citizens offarmington came out to hear me. Father, Mother, Eunice. Phebe, Mary AnnHills, cousin Achzia were present. Also Camp♢ Deming. & many of theCowls'es (God not accepted) help make up the number. I gave themour principles upon the gospel from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians 1st ch 8: 9:verses##. I was happilydisappointed oin the manner they treated the subject they gave the best of attention& herd me patiently while I addressed them about twoo two hours & notan objection was raised.

 South Fox Islands Vinalhaven Jan. 5th 1838Dear BrotherI have been sitting with my pen in my handanswering letters most of the time for three days. & as I have just taken itoff from a sheet directed to Father Mother & Sister Eunice I thoughtI would next put it on a sheet for you. I have your letter dated Nov 24now before me, & it is with pleasure I spend a few moments in complyingwith its contents. In the first place I will give you a short sketch of thing[s]with me & then answer your qusestions. I took the steamer Bangor atPortland in a hard snow storm in company with Phebe my wife to againvisit the Islands of the sea, we had not gone far before we saw the breakersmost high we had a putty [pretty] rough time, most on board were sea sick. welanded at Owles Head at night. I reached fox Islands the day followingbeing the 2nd of Nov. I found the Saints strong in the fai◇th. I have visitedthree Islands since I returned, & also the Maine land. I am labouringalone in the vineyard. But the work of God is manifesting itself at this timewith great interest in our midst. The spirit of God if like fire in dry stubble in our midst. The word of God is like a sharp two edged sword in the hearts of men.our congregations are large & profoundly attentive. The sea store isThrong'd when I baptize. Many are enquireing to know what they shall do to besaved. I have Baptized 19 since I returned to the Islands 7 of the No aresea captains. I baptized 2 sea captains & a Lady on New years Day,there is many ^that^ will soon follow their example here. There is now a dooropen for me to preach to all the neighbourning Islands, even◇ to the gut ofCaneer & the Magdalene Islands laying 800 or 1000 miles N.E. offox Islands I think of going there early in the spring, & spending a few weeksI am now on South fox Islands sitting & writing at the same table in com-pany with Mrs Woodruff with the sea spending its waves against the rocks afew rods from my feet. The ground is bare, the weather warm & pleasent. Iwalked out last eve & this morning with Phebe & viewed the sea shore, & stoodfor an hour upon a rocky turret viewing the sea foam beneath us. it speaksthe power of God. Will you inform me when you write again if you receieve theElders Journal. I should be pleased to have you perus that paper. I gave dire-ctions for it to be sent to ^you.^  Elders Joseph Smith jr & Sidney Rigdon spent a nightin Terre Haute a short time since perhaps you did not see them. I shall expectto go to Missouri next fall, & shall probably pass through Terre Haute. If you 
 are there I shall probably see you. I am gratified to learn of your prosperity intemporal business, & I hope you will prosper in spiritual things before youdie. You made one request in your letter concerning sister Eunice whichI will answer with pleasure. In expressing myself to you upon that subjectI shall speak in confidence & unreservedly for, I consider your requestto be perfectly consistant with the interest you have taken in her well-fare. Brother Asahel you spoke of being disturbed in your subject by a personcoming into the store I waited upon you in this will you give me thesame privilege. Thomas Arey has just come across the bay with a wherry (what we usedto call a skiff or boat) & wants Phebe & I to go home with him & spend the night he says he will bringus back in the morning & so I suppose I must go I will continue the subject in the morning. [FIGURE] Jan 6th I have got back we had a good sail & a plesasent time. the son shines as warm as summer the water most as still as ifnature had ceased to breathe the people say they never saw such weather here before in the winter [FIGURE] I amglad I did not fill this sheet last night for just as I came into Capt Coombs's house this morning Mother Coombs handedme two letters one of them was from Brother Asahel, Dated Terre Haute Dec 10th I have red it through & through,& there is much I would like to say concerning it hiad I time & room. I was glad to learn that you receieve themormon papers. I sent word for the Elders Journal to be sent to you, I trust you will get it. You speak of not likingthe stile & spirit of the letter from England for my part I see no impropriety in a servent of God expressing his desiresfor the wellfare of his family, if there is I have it yet to learn, however, I do not intend entering into any argumentupon the subject. from your remark I conclude you have receieved the first no of the Elders Journal. Teherenow the captain has set a bowl of dried raisins before us to heinder me awhile. I hope Brother Asahel you willexcuse this long adjunct flung in the face of Sister eunice. I will haste to answer your reasonable requestI wish you to bear in mind that Sister is advancing in life as well as ourselves& in giving you a description of her I can do no better than to state simple truth,which is the best in all cases. Sister Eunice was a child of about 11 years when I first lefther in Colebrook the day before I left I took her by the hand & led her out on awalk of 15 or 20 minutes & gave her good advice the image of her childhood countenanceremained on my mind & I could not bring any other appearance of her to my mindexcept the one she was clothed in when I shook her by the hand as a little girl to go to thewest with Azmon, & this was always the case with me untill I returned last sum-mer to Colebrook & wraped at her school house door & I will will assume you Dearsir that wrap was made amid enexpressible sensations, when In an instant ourownly sister stood before me took me be the hand & saluted me with a kiss, thenat that instant all of her former appearence her childish countenance departed frommy mind & recollection like electricity, yea with the rapidity of lightning. & it isas much impossible for me now to recall & imagine in my mind how she look'd &appeared at 11 years of age as it would be for me to imagine how you will look &appear at 40 should you live untill that time, for you will beare in mind that afemale receieves the greatest change from 11 to 17 or 18 of any period. On seeing EuniceI found her midling size in stature not tall, rather stocky, but of a pleasing formwith the appearence of a young woman or Lady (not a child) I think she has the looksof Philo in her countenance. Wien I first had an interview with her she was varyresereve bordering upon a distance. I suppose because I was a Mormon priest. you 
 know the days have been & still are in some degree that a man might as well lookfor popularity in to-fet as among the gentiles with the appetation of mormon abouttims or toth advocate the principles of Latter Day Saints. & that to because, the world donot believe the Bible. I have been surprised to see how fearful some of my relativesand old neighbours were of me in connecticut, they supposed I had turned into an Elep-fant, Hotantat, or an Arab, & I dont know but this is the case with you if it is I hopeyou will some day learn to the contrary, but I see I am of from my subject. Isoon showed Sister Eunice by an easy appearence & familiararity that I was stillWillford & I am happy to say that I had an uncommon agreeable visit with heralthough it was short, I am pleased to have a sister as well qualified to adornand humour the female sect, character or circle, as I consider Eunice to ^be^. I have seensome of the world & it is verry seldom I have found a female making betterappearence in company than Eunice she is graceful modest & appears to understandevery crook & turn about right. I must confess ^xxx^ I admire her turn ofmind in mose cases, one in particular, she is not elated with ribbons, ruffles, rings& ornamenting the body not that I think these is so much sin in these, but I amproud (if I may be allowed the expression) that my sisters mind is more noble. I discoversome gems in her mind that most of females in riper years are destitute of. Do notunderstand me by this remark, concerning dress that Eunice does not dress rich neet,& tidy, or that her apperrel is not well aranged for she does. in speaking of her [page torn]-ections I did not discover but one & that we are all of us more or less ge [page torn]I mean lightness bordering upon what we call rudeness, but I was so cheerful & sociable with her myself that I had no fa^u^lt to find with her upon that subjectI think Brother Asahel she will answer your expectations & desires concerningher. I am in hopes with her outward accomplishments she will be a worshiperof the true & living GOD. I hope your advise to her will always incline hermind that way she is not insensible of the interest you are taking in herwelfare & I hope you will yet have your reward by seeing her arisein life doing honour to her Brother, to virtue, to her parents, to all her relatives, to hercountry & her God. But I must dissmiss this subject for the present by sayingthat if your delight ins in the company of boys & girls in memory of your sister, I wouldsay that season is past with her & the refinement of riper years would more suitcase. I do not know that I have answered your expectations in replyingto your qustions if ^not^ make further inquiries & I will do according to my abilities.I receeved your papers you sent me, I shall be pleased to still hear fromyou from time to time. Mrs. Woodruff thinks you for your notice of her& wishes to be remembered to you with evey feelingof her soul & hopes yet to see youWillford WoodruffAsahel H Woodruff

 (North Lat 44 East Long 69, 10. Fox Islands) Vinalhaven Maine, Oct 20th 1837.Brother AsahelAs I am called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defenceof the word of God & for the testimony of Jesus Christ, I am still under the necessity ofmaking use of my pen to communicate to you all the information you getfrom me, as I am not permited at present to speak with you face to face. Thereis many things resting upon my mind, that I wish to communicate to you, evenmore than this sheet will contain: however I must be content by giving youa synopsis of some few of them. Firstly, I have two letters lying before mewhich are the productions of your pen, under date of July 22nd, & Sept 27th, 1837. Anddear Brother you may rest assured it is with no small degree of satisfaction, that I ampermitted to peruse & reperuse such letters from a Brother to whom I am boundby the ties of consanguinity; & in whose best & fina^a^l welfare I feel more deeplyinterested than any but mysefl ^12^ is aware of. It is truly a treat to ones soul to receive a letter from a friend with whom he he has been long seperated: and beencalled to travel among strangers for years, and not permitted to behold with hiseyes the change that time has brought upon the image & face of his friend & Brother. Inever was more forcibly struck with the change of a friend produced in five years, thanin Sister Eunice: and if the change is as great in Brother Asahel I should not know him wereI to meet him in Terre Haute. Had I room, I should like to be more lengthy in this inspeaking of both of your letters than my limits will now permit; suffice it to saythey are both interesting to mye; And I have not a relative on earth with whom I more desire an interview than with yourself, But when I shall have the privilege God ownlyknows. I also receieved a letter from Mother dated Aug 23 which was interesting to me;they were all well &c. As concerning myself, I still enjoying my usual goodhealth, peace, & contentment. {And am growing more and more formed in the faith in which I am engaged} I have thought of latein my private walks and mediatations, that there was not a happier man on earth thanmyself; except such as possess more of the spirit, knowledge, & wisdom of God, than I do; & Ihope that class are many. I am honest in saying, that I feel my peace to be like a river. (donot understand me to intimate that my righteousness is great) I have every thing of a temporalnature that reason can demand, to eat, to drink. to wear, my friends are numerous. I am not as yet much injured by my enemies. I have a wife that I love with all my heart& I have cause to do so. I am blessed in my spiritual calling in preaching the gospelwhareever I go, the word is attended with spirit and power, souls are converted to God, {thousands seek instructing at my mouth} & even the captains that trade in ships at sea are demanding baptism at my hands;the priests of the different religions & gospels of the day, are bitterly complaining that I am [hole burned in paper] sap[in]g the verry foundation of their churches, & Holy religion &c. {shorthand}{shorthand} Ah say you Willford boasts pretty well. No dear Brother I have not made the aboveremarks in order to boast, for who am I, a poor, ignorant, weak, illiterate Willford. it is not Ithat have done these things alone. All these blessings of which I speak have been bestowedupon me from the hand of God, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ.I know it requires meekness, wisdom, & good sense in times of success & prosperity,in order to keep humble, & know & feel our prrper place. I do think the Blessingsbestowed upon me of late have had a tendency to show me my own weakness, havepointed out the source from whence they came, & enable'd me to see that self exhaltationis not good or profitable. {shorthand}?[sideways text] When you write to me inform me if you have any intelligence from Brother Azmon & his family Thom-pson &c I wrote to them from New Rowley but have not herd from them. I intend writing to Eunice as soon asI get time, I do not find much spare time for any thing, tell me how and whare she is. Give me the newsyou get from any of our friends. I expect to have a cold time of it this winter here in Maine [illegible] [end of sideways text] 
 Perhaps you would like to know what I have been about since II left New Rowley &c. At least I will venture to give you a brief acc-ount of matters & things with me. On the 8th of Aug, in company withmy wife I arived at Mr Ezra Carter's My father in law in the State of Maine,and you may rest assured we met a most welcome reception amid tears ofjoy, and was entertained with every mark of Kindness, respect, & friendship, thatBrethren, Sisters, or Parents were capable of affording. Also refreshed with everyluxury of a Fathers house. I spent about ten days with these my new relatives& friends;: I spent the time plesantly with my companion in this new circle of friendscomposed of five Sisters, three Brothers, & a Father & Mother in Law with otherappendages of relationship. I found them to be universally respectable, intelligent,influential, & possessing some wealth if I could judge from outward appear-ances of white houses & chaise's &c. four of the Sisters have been ingaged in teachingSchool, two of the Brothers in the Mercantile line in the city of Portland 10 milesfrom Father Carters house. Father Carter is a tanner [ink spot] & carrier by trade& continues the business untill this day. Phebe {shorthand} is 7 days younger thanmyself I was born March 1st 1807 & she the 8th of March same month. My wife hasspent the early part of of her life teaching School, & for the last 7 years she has closelyconfined herself with her nedle to the Tailoress trade, at which business she wasingaged in at Kirtland when I became acquainted with her. After an intimatecorrespondence with her, I became convinced it was the will of God for us to become{bosom} freiiends I offered her my heart, it was accepted. We were joined in matrimony &we live happy. {Neither of us are very handsome but we both look well enough for we are as God made us} Phebe is small in stature, possessesan amiable disposition, is good enough for me; & sends her kindest respects to youaccompanied with her unfeigned thanks for the interest you have manifested in herwelfare; we both much desire to see you &c. &c.On the 19th Aug; in companywith Elder Jonathan H. Hale, I took the Steamer Bangor at Portland ^PoP. 16,000^ withthe intention of visiting fox Islands. We left the Steam Boat atOwls Head & went aboard of a sloop which landed us up on the Islands at 2 oclockSunday morning the 20th. It gave me rather singular feelings to be landedupon an Island of the Sea in the darkness of the night, being an intire stranger toall men in the region; however after wandering awhile over the rocks, we found a house wecalled & went to bed. We arose in the morning, made ourselves known as servants of God & askedif thaere was any religion or priests on the Island, we were informed there was a Baptistchurch, & Priest, & meetinghouse in the centre of the Island. I will give a brief note of the townVinalhaven is North Lat 44 East Long 69 10. Pop 1800. St. of Maine. The town of Vinalhaven incldes both north & south fox Islands. The inhabitantsare generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous & hospitable. The people get most of their living & wealth by fishing. the town fits out 10.7licensed sail besides small crafts. North fox Island is 9 miles londg & 2 miles wide. Pop, 800. They have a post Office, one store, a baptist church andmeeting house & a Priest. & four schoolhouses, & a grist mill. The land is a rather rocky & rough, yet there are many good farms which producesfine wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, & grass which ais the staple productions. The timber is fir, spruice, hemlock, & birch. Sheep are the principal stockupon the Island. Rasp & Gooseburies grow in great abundance.South fox Island is one mile south of the North Island, & it comes asnear being without any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would puzzle the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about10 miles long & 5 broad, and it is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, & dales. Cut up into necks, and points, to make room forthe cooves & harbours that run through & through the Island. one may form some little Idea of it, on learning that it is rising of 100 miles roundthe Island to follow the beach in all its wingdings. The Pop is 1000 they get their wealth entirely by fishing. They have some sheep, & some partsof the Island is under cultivation, but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants fish at New foundland & bring the fish hometo this Island, & dry them upon their own flakes, and prepare them for market.: they supply the market annually with great quantities of driedfish, Mackerel, & boxed herren. They have two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, & a small branch of the Methodist Church& a priest. The timber the same as on North Island with the addition of Pine. There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves,& harbours, of these Islands, such as Whale, Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, HolloboatCod, Pollock, Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt,Skate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Mutton fish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munk fish, Nurs fish, Sun fish, Sword fish, Thrasher, Cat, Scuppos, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, Ling, Eels, Also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop, Mussles, Pincles, {shorthand} And Porposes, Seal, &c&c & many others not named.I have seen two or three Whale in sight at once. I have caught Cod, Haddock, & Hake, as fast as I couldthrow out out one line & haul in another. I have stood on the wharf & caught Mackarael out of a large school as fast as I could throw in myhook into the water & pull it out, they would bite the bare hook. or take bate out of my fingers like chickens if I would hold it in the waterI have been bathing in the salt water & seen numbers of Seal swiming around some of them near me with their heads out of water look like dogs.{shorthand} Thus stands a brief account of fox Islands 
 I now wish to call your attention back to the first day that I visited the Island. I saidit was on Sunday & of course there was to be preaching in the Baptist Meeting house.I hastened to the place, meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon he came to the door,I informed him we were servants of God, had a message to the people, & wished to be herd.he informed the priest of it. We were invited into the pulpet & our appointment given out. Thepriest finished his discourse; invited us home with him, gave us some refreshment. We presentedhim the Book of Mormon he did not at first object, was mild & said he would read it. Hesoon accompanied us to the meeting house, the congregation was assembled, & itwas with peculiar feelings that I arose to address a congregation upon an Island ofthe Sea, to present before them the fullness of the everlasting gospel, & the authentitcity ofthe Book of Mormon, as it was the first time to my knowledge that an Elder of LatterDay Saints ever trod the sail of one of the Islands, or his voice herd by the inhabitants in procl-aiming the word fo God. I had the strictest attention of all, their appearance indicated a thoughtthat they had herd strange things to day. When I closed I gave out an appointment forthe four following evenings to be held in the several districts. to cut a long story short sufficeit to say, they came out by hundreds, christian & sinner, captain & sailor, priest & people,the sound went abroad to the neighbouring Islands, their sails were soon spread to waftthem o'er the deep to hear the tidings for themselves. During the first 14 days we delivered19 discourses. Many began to believe. The two priests made friends like Herod & Pilate, theybecame alarmed, they began to oppose & rage, they had no influence over the people.The Baptist priest spent one Sunday in his meeting house without a soul to accompany himwhile I had a congregation; even his own church & deacon were attending our meeting, investigating the subject, & inviting us to visit them. Vinalhaven never was as [page torn]stir'd up before, in peace or war. The priest imediately sent letters to the mainl[a] [page torn]come over & help us or we fall {shorthand} The Baptist priest fearing [page torn]not come went after them himself, while while the Methodist priest came from the South Island & madeopen war against the Book of Mormon & our principals. I attended his meeting look a min-ute of his discours, & publicly answered his crooked remarks, & he returned home confoundedsoon the Baptist priest returned with several others & held a six days meeting, it did nottake affect the mark was torn from the eyes of the people & they began to see clearly, afterI had fairly set our principals before the people, I opened a door for Baptism& twelve offered themselves as candidates; We led them down into the sea & Baptizedthem & of a truth they returned rejoicing: two of the number were respectable seacaptains. The cry from the neighbouring Islands soon entered our ears come over& preach to us. Some came from the Maine land to hear, & they believe & wish to be bap-tized, hundreds are believing, & many ready to be baptized. I visited South Island preached10 times, returned to North Island, organized a small branch of the church, returned to the Mainland, travled 200 miles with Elder Hale towards Kirtland; took the parting hand with, [{shorthand}] He has gone tospend the winter in Kirtland. I returned to Father Carters after my wife, whose company I am nowenjoying. I shall return to Vinalhaven in few days to spend the winter. I shall not return west Ithink start of a year. I shall spend the time on these Islands & the maine land think for a year. I neverbefore have seen such doors open for preaching, the courthouse in Camden is offered me to lecture inI shall except of the offer when I return, it is the nearest town to Vinalhaven Pop 6000 & a num-ber have offered themselves for baptism there. Ps. I wish you to direct all of your letters to Vinalhaven Maine, for the present, as I shall make that my stand. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Tell me of any News you get from our frie-nds and also inform me if you get the M & Advocate now, the kirtland paper. I shall be glad to call and see you when I go westbut there is a prospect now of it's being some time first. I shall however calculate to see my wife settled in Missouri before I leavethis Continent, which may be sooner than I have calculated, we have now seven Elders in England apart of the twelve, and assoon as doors are open in Europe so that they need help the first Seventy will follow the twelve into that country, and as I am a member of that quorum I shall not hesitate to go when duty calls. That the blessings of heaven may attend you in every lawfulcalling. & that all things may work together for your good both temporal & spiritual is the prayer of your BrotherWillford Woodruff.Asahel H.

 40 Ironmonger Row, Saint Lukes, LONDON Jan 13th 1841My Der^a^r PhebeI once more seat myself to write to you I have your two last letters now spread before me one under Date of Oct 6th to 19th & the other Oct 25th to Nov 2nd Andthey both were truly interesting to me. I sent you a vary full sheet the the size of this Dated Nov 22ndwhich I hope you have got before this time. I inserted an Extract from about 30 letters from my Brethren in this country, & as I mailed this just Before I got your dated Oct 6th to 19th so I though[t]I would not answer it untill I herd from you again. I however acknowledged the reception of it in a letter which Elder Kimball wrote to his wife On the 4th of Jan your last letter Dated Nov 2ndcome safe to hand, by the barers who arived safe & are setting their business to moovewith the whole church in which they reside next spring. I trust you have obtained my letters in answer to yours before this time, in which I expressed my feelings concerning the death of Our dear little Sarah. your lines in poetry On her death in your Oct 6th letter were truly sublime & affecting & none could feel them more deeply than myself. I highly prize them more so as they came from your pen. I have recived 7 letters from you since I have but in England, & it has truly Been a feast to my feelings to hear from you by letter when we are seperated so far apart, in fine I never so highly prized the privilge of writing as during the last year of my life. I am now sitting by the side of ElderH. C. Kimball. We are enjoying good health & many Blessings from God. Hark!!! thePostman is at my door he hands me a Bundle of Letters one a ship letter from New York. On opening it, who can imagin my surprise on finding it to be the usual salutation & hand writing of My Dear Phebe Dated NY. City Dec. 6, 1840 "Truly strange things happen in the Last days" your letter informs me that Brothers J. F. Carter & L. Scammans had visited you in the west, & wished you to returned with them & spend the winter at your Fathers untill my return, you having excepted the offer of course accounts for yourbeing in New York. This unexpected intelligence for a moment gave me a peculiar sensation of Both joy & sorrow, of Joy at the Idea of your having the privilege of spending the winter at your friends Fathers House & among your friends & that I could the soonsooner behold your face & enjoy your society while on my visit among our friendsin Maine, as well as your company on my journey west, calling upon our friends in Connecticut. On the other hand I felt sorry that the packages letters & things which I have sent you could not have fallen into your hands instead of another. or at least that you could not have obtained them before you left. Inasmuch as you had an opportunity to go East, I feel to say Amen to it & my prayer to God is that you may have a good visit with your friends, & that you may prove a Blessing unto them while you are with them, & that you maymaintain your integrity before the Lord, & enjoy peace, health, & strength, & grace according to your day in all things, you have never been forgotten by me before a throne of grace, you inform me in your last letter that you hadnot received any lette[r]s from me since the one dated the 6th of July I felt sorry to hear this for I have written many since that date & several full sheets thesize of this & I have taken much pains in all of them to give you information of all things that I thought would be of Interest unto you. I hope Sister Kimball willnot send you all the packages of letters by Mail which I sent you by Elder Turley & othr private conveyance without opening them for some of them contained half a dozen letters for the fox Island friends & othrs, four letters contained gold coin which is not suitable to send by mail. I sent many things by Eldr Turley in packages which I much desired you should obtain, the following in substance is extracts from my Journal which will ^give^ an ideaof the letters I have written you & othr friends in the U.S. since the one dated July 6th of which you speak as being the last one Recceved.

There will be a great & important work here in London It has been hard starting the work here because we had not power to get at the minds of the people as soon as in other places we laboured harder to get the first 20 Baptized in London than we should now to Baptize 100 for several of the London papers are printing against us which bringsour cause into note & we are begining to have crouded congregations& that is what we want for if we can get people to hear they will believe & recieve it if they are honest & willing to receive the truth. I have had the fullest meetings to day I have ever had in London (17th)8 were added since last sabbath, & 5 offered for Baptism at the close of the meeting to, night, we are about to hire a larger chapelLondon is a very important place & will be the cenetre point of the saints for all Europe, & we feel anxious to leave a good standard here when we return home, I shall contine my labours in London untill March except I may be absent a few days to attenda conference in Scotland & Ireland, we shall have a conference in London before we leave for New York which will be [e]arly in the spring.

 The history and travels of ZionsCamp, led by the prophet JosephSmith from Kirtland Ohio to ClayCounty Missouri in the Spring of 1834.Written by Wilford Woodruff AssistantHistorian, who was a member of Zions CampThe Saints of God were driven fromJackson County into Clay Countyabout the 13th of November 1833 on whichnight were the signs in the Heavens of thefalling of the Stars, see History of the Church,Millennial Star Vol. 18 Page 583. After the Saints weredriven to Clay County, they were scattered on thebanks of the of the Missouri river and in thewoods around. Bishop Partridge called a councilof the Authorities of the Church in Zion and whocalled for volunteers of two men to go to Kirtlandto see the Prophet Joseph and ask council aboutwhat course to pursue; and as no one volenteredParley P. Pratt steped forward and sayed hewould go. Bishop Partridge asked what situationhe was in to go; He sayed he had a coat inthe world, his family wife lay sick and destitutebut he was ready to go. Lyman Wight wasthe next one volenter; when asked how he wassituated and if he had means to go, he said 
 his wife lay beside a log in the woods with achild three days old with nothing to eat, but hewas ready to go under these strange circumstances.The services of the two volunters were accepted, and theLord opened the way for both of them to get a horse,saddle, bridle, and outfit to prepare for this tediousjourney of one thousand miles in the depth ofWinter, on horseback to visit the Prophet Josephat Kirtland, Ohio. On their arrival there, arrivaland laying their situation, and that of theSaints in Zion; the Prophet inquired of theLord, and received that Revelation, Section 103concerning the redemption of Zion Feb. 28 1834.(Coppy the revelation.)The Saints of the Lord were required to gather up the strength of theLord's house. It will be seen in the Revelationthat Joseph Smith and Parley Pratt was totravel together. Lyman Wight and SidneyRigdon, Hyrum Smith and Fredrick G. WilliamsOrson Hyde and Orson Pratt, These brotherinwent forth according to the Revelation, togather up the strength of the Lords house.Parley Pratt after traveling with JosephSmith a while, traveled alone and visitedRichfield, Onega County, New York; where hefound Azman and Wilford Woodruff;and held two meetings at their home, 
 where he found a few saints; and WilfordWoodruff accompanied him with HarryBrown to Henderson County where hevisited the few saints who had been orginizedin that region of country. His object invisiting the saints at the present time was toget the young men and middle aged togo to Kirtland and accompany the Prophet upto Missouri for the redemption of Zion. But theonly ones he got to go to Kirtland from northernNew York was Wilford Woodruff and Harry BrownWarren S. Ingllas who arrived togather in Kirtlandon the night of the 25 of April 1834, and the firsttime they met with the Prophet Joseph Smith,who invited them to make their home with himwhile they stayed in Kirtland, which invertationthey gladly accepted. Orson Pratt and JohnMurdock also accompanied them to Kirtland.The brothering were arriving daily in Kirt-land, to preprare for their journey. Oneevening while Wilford Woodruff, MiltonHomes, and sevral of the brotherin were withthe Prophet in his house he sayed "I want somemoney to help fit out Zion and I know thatI shall have it." In the morning Brother JosephReceived a letter from Sister Vose of Boston,containing $250. He took the money out of the 
 letter and showed it to the brotherin, presentand said, "Did I not tell you [blank] last nightthat I would soon have some money andhere it is." On Sunday the 27 of April thesaints met togather and held a testamonymeeting, and many of the elders spoke andbore their testimony, among the numberwas Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young,Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Hyrum Smith,Oliver Cowdry, and also Joseph Smith theProphet who closed by saying "Brothering weare laying the foundation of a great workand you know it not, you comprehend itnot. The work we are engaged in will grow,spread, and increase untill it will fill theland: it will go from sea to sea it willfill the Rocky Mountains: all nations willhear it: it will fill its destiny; It is the work ofAlmighty God, and he will maintain anddefend it." Wilford Woodruff sayed in hisjournal it appears to me there was more lightmade manifest in that meeting partaining ^to^ the gospel and kingdom of Godthan I had ever received from the whole Secter-rian world. The Prophet Joseph calledthe men togather who were gowing upto Zion before leaving Kirtland 
 and seal them up to eternal life.According to appointment on the 1st dayof May 1834 those who were ready leftKirtland for New Portage, their wasbut a small po[r]tion of the companyready. The company that didstarte was composed of over twentymen, with four baggage wagons.Wilford Woodruff owned one of the fourteams, and baggage wagons whichhe drove. The company pitched theirtents by the way. This first companytearried with the Church at New Portageuntill the main body arrived fromKirtland. On the 6th day of May, wewere then fully organized. As the saintshad been robbed of nearly every thingin Missouri, the Prophet gathered to-gather clowthing and such nesseriesof life as could be obtained for them,also provided for ourselves horses, wagonsguns and tents for our journey, alsoall sorts of munitions of war, forself defense as our enemies were threateningon every side. The history of Joseph sayes,"My company from Kirtland, amountedto about one hundred, mostly young men 
 and nearly all elders, prists, teachers,or deacons. And as our wagons werenearly filled with baggage we hadto travil mostly on foot. On the 7 Igathered togather all the companyand each one donated what moneyhe had into one general fund; and weappointed F. G. Willams paymaster ofthe company for the funds thus collect-ed. The following is the whole list of thenames of the camp, being two hund-red and five men and five women,some of whom were not present at thefirst organization. (Incert the list; in theDeseret News Vol. 14 No 1 page 21. [blank])I asked brother Woodruff for the use ofhis sword to carry on the journeywhich he readely granted. We now hadin our camp twenty baggage wagons.I continued to organize the companyby appointing sutch other generalofficers as were required, and gavesutch instructions as were nessary forthe deciplin, order, comfort, and safety ofall concerned. I divided the whole campinto companies of twelve. Each companyselecting their own captain, who severaly 
 arranged each man in his respectivecompany, and assigned his place, andduty, which was generaly in the followingorder, Two cooks. Two firemen. Two tent pitch-ers. Two watchmen. One runner. Two wagonersand horsmen. and one comisary. Wepurchased flower; baked our own bread; coockedour own provisions generaly, which were goodbut sometimes scanty; and sometimeswe had jonny cake or corn-dodger, insteadof flour bread. Every night before retireingto rest at the sound of the trumpetwe bowed before the Lord, in the severaltents; and presented our thank and offeringswith prayer and supplications; and atthe sound of the morning trumpet everyman was again on his knees before the Lord,imploring his blessings for the day. Ourjourney was like the ancient Jareditespitching our tents by the way. May 8, 1834 ~ ThursdayMay the 8th. After completing our organization by number-ing our wagons, we commenced our marchtoward Zion. The weather was pleasant, anddelightful. We traveled through the dayand pitched our tents in a beautifulgreen, at Chippeway for the night twelvemiles from New Portage. May 9, 1834 ~ Friday9th. We continued 
 our journey and camped at nightnear Woorster. May 10, 1834 ~ Saturday10th. Saturday, We passedthrough Mansfield, and camped forthe Sabbeth in Richfield town ship. Aboutone hour after we had encamped, eldersLimon E. Johnson, Willard Snow anda number of others joined the campfrom the north west parts of Vermont.May 11, 1834 ~ SundaySunday the 11th. The camp cametogother for a meeting. The sacramentwas administered. Elder Sylvester Smithpreached. We were there joined by eightaddional brotherin; in company withelder Elias Benson from Richland andStark Counties, most of whom wereGermans. May 12, 1834 ~ Monday12th. We left Richfieldtraveled about thirty five miles; passedthrough Bucyrus and camped on theSandusky plains, at a short distancefrom the place where the indiansroasted General Crawford, and nearthe indian settlement. May 13, 1834 ~ Tuesday13th. We pass-ed through a long range of beech woodswhere the roads were very bad; in someinstances we had to fasten ropes to thetongues of the wagons, to draw themout of the sloughs and mud holes. 
 Brother Parley P. Pratt broke his harness;the brotherin fastened their ropes to hiswagon and drew it about three milesto the place of encampment on the Sci-oto, river, while he was riding in his wagonsinging and whistling. May 14, 1834 ~ Wednesday14th Wednesday.We traveled on to Belle Fountain wherewe discovered refrectory feeling in SylvesterSmith who expressed great dissatisfactionbecause we were short of flour; althoughwe had used all diligence to procure asupply, and captin Brigham Younghad previously sent two men aheadto provide a supply for his company.May 15, 1834 ~ ThursdayThursday the 15th. We forded theMad river and passing through abeautiful country, encamped a littlewest of Springfield. This night MosesMorton fell asleep while on centry, andI went ant took his sword and left himasleep. May 16, 1834 ~ FridayFriday the 16th, About nine oclockwhile I was riding on a wagon withbrother Hiram, Ezra Thair and Gorge A.Smith; we came into a place of thickwoods of recent growth, when I told them Ifelt much deprest in spirits, and lonesome,and that there had been a great deal of 
 bloodshed in that place, and when evena man of God is in a place wheremany has been killed he will feellonesome and unpleasant and his spiritswill sink. About forty rods from whereI made this observation we came throughthe woods; we saw a large farm, andthere was near the road on our left a moundsixty feet high covered with apple trees, andsurrounded with oats; this mound containedhuman bones. At dinner time some of thebrotherin expressed considerable fear, onaccount of milk sickness with which thepeople were troubled dureing our route;many were afraid to use milk or butter,and appealed to me, to know if itwas not dangerous; I told them to useall they could get, untill they were toldit was sick. Some expressed fears thatit might be sold to us by our enemiesfor the purpose of doing us injury; Itold them not to fear, that if theywhould follow council, and use all theycould get from friends or enemies it whoulddo them good and none should be sickin consequense of it; and althoughwe passed through naberhoods where 
 many of the people, and cattle wereinfeebled, yet my words were fulfilled.While passing through Dayton, Ohiogreat anxiety was manifested; variousreports of our numbers and designshaving wgone before us; some of theinhabidents inquired of the companywhere we were goingfrom, Captin BrighamYoung replied, from every place butthis, and we will soon be fromthis. Where are you gowing? To thewest. We forded the Maumee riverwith our baggage wagons, and mostof the men waded through the water.Some ten or eleven gentlemen cameover from Dayton to ascertain ournumbers, which they reported at leastsix hundred. These gentlemen inquiredof many in the camp where wewere from, and where we weregowing, and what was our business.They returned to Dayton and reportedthat every man in the company wasa gentleman, and gave a respectfulanswer to every question asked, but theycould not ascertain where they weregowing, and what their business was. 
 This evening a court muster was held incamp for the trial of Moses Martin for fallingasleep, on watch. Brother Martin pleadedhis own case; sayed that he was overcomewith fetague, and so overpowered that hecould not keep awake ect., ect. I desided thathe should be acquitted, and never go tosleep again while on watch, which wassanctioned by the court. I took occasionfrom the circumstance to give the brotherinmuch useful instruction. May 17, 1834 ~ SaturdaySaturday 17th.We crossed the state line of Ohio and encampedfor the Sabeth just within the limits ofIndiana, having traveled about forty milesthat day; our feet were sore and blisteredour stockins wet with blood, the weatherwas very warm at night. A spy attempedto get into our camp, but was preventedby our guards. We had our sentinalsposted every night every night on accountof spies who were continually strivingto haress us by attempting to steal ourhorses, ect. ect., This evening there was a difficultybetween some of the brotherin, and SylvesterSmith on occasion of which I was calledto deside in the matter; finding a rebell-ous spirit in Sylvester Smith, and to 
 some extent in others, I told them theywhould meet with misfortune, difficulties,and hinderances, and sayed, "You will know it before you leave this place," exhortingthem to humble themselves before the Lord; andbecome united, that they might not be scourg-ed. A very singular circamstance took placethat very night, and the next day, concerningour teams. On Sunday morning when wearose, we found almost every horse in campso badly foundered that we could scarcelylead them a few rods to water. The brotherinthen deeply realized the effects of discord. WhenI learned the fact, I exclaimed to the brotherin,that for a witness that God over rulled, andhad his eye upon them, that all thoeswho would humble themselves before the Lordshould know that the hand of God wasin this misfortune, and their horses shouldbe restored to health amediately; and bytwelve oclock the horses were as kninbles as ever,with the acception of one of Sylvester Smith'shorses, which soon after died. May 18, 1834 ~ SundaySundaythe 18th. We had preaching as usual, andthe sacrement ^was^ administered. May 19, 1834 ~ MondayMonday 19th.We traveled thirty one miles, passed throughVandalia and encamped in Franklin 
 township, Henry County, in the beech woods.May 20, 1834 ~ TuesdayTuesday 20th. We traveled through the day,twenty five miles, and encamped nearGreenfield. Some part of the way the roadsbeing so bad, I waded over my boot topsin mud, and helped to pull throughthe wagons, with ropes which were fixedwith an iron hook in the end, which washoocked in the tongue of the wagon, andwhich was easily managed. While we were eatingdinner, three gentlemen came riding upon very fine loocking horses, commenced theirinquiry of various ones concerning our travelingin so large a body. Asking where we werefrom, and where we were gowing. The replywas as usual: some from the state of Maine;another whould say, "I am from York state," somefrom Maschusetts, some from Ohio, and some whouldreply "We are from the east." and as soon as wehave done eating dinner, we start to gowest again. They then addressed themselves toDr. Willams to see if they could find outwho the company was. The Docter replied we have no one in particular. They asked if we hadnot a general to take the lead of the company.His reply was no one in particular; butsayed they, is there not some one amoung 
 you; who you call your captain or leader, or sup-erior to the rest? He answered: Sometimes oneand sometimes another takes charge of thecompany: so as not to throw the burdenupon anyone in particular. Their spieswho had come from the west; passed usseveral times that same day, and the next.May 21, 1834 ~ WednesdayAlthough threatened by our enemies that weshould not, We passed through IndianapoliasMay the 21st unmollested. All the inhabitantswere quiet. We had been following the Nat-ional road since the 18th, where it was traveledfrequently we had to take buyroads, whichwere many, and led through thick woods.At night we encamped a few miles westof Indianapplias. There had previously beenso many reports that we never should bepermitted to pass through that place, andthat the Governer whould have us dispersed.Some of the brotherin were afraid we mighthave difficulty there, but I had told themin the name of the Lord we should notbe disturbed, and that we should passIndianipplas, without the people knowingit, when we neared the place, many gotinto the wagons and seperating somelittle distance passed through the city 
 While others walked down differantstreets leaving the inhabtants wonderingwhen that big company whould comealong. May 22, 1834 ~ ThursdayThursday the 22nd. Aftertraveling through the day, we encampedon a small stream of water in agrove near Blleville May 23, 1834 ~ Friday23rd Friday. Aftera long days drive we encampedabout four miles from Green-CastleMay 24, 1834 ~ Saturday24th. Saturday. We crossed the Wabash riverat Clinton in ferry boats, in very quicktime, and pushed on to the state linewhere we arrived at a very late houer inthe evening, and encamped in an oakopening in Edger County, Illinois. May 25, 1834 ~ SundayMaythe 25th, Sunday. We had no meetingtoday, but attended to washing, bakeing,and preparing to resume our journey.A man in disguise, having on an oldseal-skin cap, came into our camp. Heswore we were gowing up to Jackson County,and that we should never get over the Miss-issippi river alive, It was evident he was a spy,and I recollect having see him in Jackson CountyMissouri. May 26, 1834 ~ Monday26th, Monday. A very hot day. Wetraveled through Paris and acrosst asixteen mile prairie. At noon we stopped 
 to bait at a slough, about six miles fromthe timber. Having no water to drink, butsutch as was filled with living animals, common-ly called wigglers, and we did not like to swal-low them, we strained them through ourteeth; which saved the life of many a pooranimal. This was the first prairie of anymagnitude that we came to on ourjourney; and was a great curiosity to manyof the brotherin, it was so very level thata deer miles off appeared but a shorte dis-tance. some of the brotherin started inpursuit, before they were apprised of their mis-take. We continued our march, pullingour wagons through a small creek withropes, and came to the house of WillamWayne the only settler in the vacanity,where we found a well of water, which wasone of the gratest comforts that we couldhave received, as we were almost famished,and it was a long time before we could,or dared to satisfy our thirst. We crossedthe Embarras river and encamped on asmall branch of the same, about one milewest. In pitching my tent we found, three[blank] prairie rattle snakes, whichthe brothern were about to kill, I sayed, "let 
 them alone; dont hurt them, how will theserpant ever loose its vermin, while the servantsof God possess the same dispasition, and con-tinue to make war upon him. Men must becomehumble before the brute creation, and whenmen lose their virtuous dispasition, and seekto destroy the animal race, the lion and thelamb can dwell together, and the sucklingchild play with the serpant in safety.["] The brother-in took the serpants carefully on sticks, andcarried them acrossed the creek. I exhorted thebrotherin not to kill a serpant, bird, oranimal of any kind during our journey,unless it was nessary to preserve ourselves fromhunger. I had frequently spoken upon thissubject, when on a certain occasion I cameup to the brotherin who were watching asqurrel on a tree, and to prove them, andto know if they whould heed my council.I took one of their guns, shot the squrreland passed on, leaving the squrrel on theground. Br. Orson Hyde, who was just behindcame up, picked up the squrrel and said,"We will cook this, that nothing may belost." I percieved that the brotherin under-stood what I sayed it for, and in theirpractice gave more heed to my percept, than 
 to my example, which was right. This eveningBrother Parley P. Pratt and Amasa Lymanreturned from the Eugene branch, Indiana,where I had sent them; with a company of abouta dozen men. The report of mobs which werecontinually saluting our rear, caused the brotherinto be constantly alive to the subject, and abouteleven oclock this evening, our picketed guardreported that they saw the fires of the mob onthe south east of us. I instantly discovered themistake, but wishing the brotherin to enjoythe scene as well as myself, amediately dischargedmy gun which was a signal to call allmen to arms. When the companies were allparaded, and ready for battle, I pointed themto the reflection of the rising moon, resting onpoints of timber on the east, which gave the ap-parence of the reflection of the light, of a numberof camp fires. The scenery was most delightful,and was well worth the trouble of any manarising from his coutch to witness, who hadnever see the like, on the broad prairie before.This circumstance provered that nearly everyman in the camp was ready for battle ac-cepte Gould (who was not baptized) and cap-tain Jezeniah B. Smith who was suddenlytaken with the chollic and did not leave 
 his tent. The whole scenery was very amus-ing. Not withstanding our enemies werecontinually breathing threats of vialence wedid not fear, neither did we hesitate toprasecute our journey, for God was with us,and his angels were before us; and the faithof our little band was unwavering. We knewthat angels were our companions, for we seenthem. May 27, 1834 ~ TuesdayTuesday May the 27thWe arrived at the Okaw branch of theriver Kaskaskia where we found two log canoo-es, which we tacked together, and on whichwe ferried our baggage acrost the stream. Wethen swam our horses and wagons, andwhen we arrived at the oppiset shore, thebrotherin fastonned ropes to the wagontongues and helped the teams out of the water,and up the steep bank, some of the brother-in felled a tall tree acrossed the river, on which theypassed over, and carried some of their baggagon their backs. While we were passing GorgeA. Smith discovered a spring which with alittle digging furnished us with an abund-ant supply of excelent water, which afterwardsreceived the name of the mormon spring.This afternoon elder Solomon Humphry anaged brother of the camp, having become 
 exceedingly weary leaid down on theprairie to rest himself and fell asleep. Whenhe awoke he saw a rattle snake which laybetween him and his hat, which hehad in his hand when he fell asleep, coiledup within one foot of his head. The brotheringathered around him saying, "It is a rattlesnake let us kill it." But, Br. Humphry said"No I'll protect him, you shant kill him, for he andI have had a good nap together.["]May 28, 1834 ~ WednesdayMay the 28th.We passed on as usual axcept sufferingmuch for the want of water and provisions,and arrived at Decatus township; encampedon a small stream of water, where one of brotherTanner's horses died.May 29, 1834 ~ ThursdayMay the 29th.Having to buy a horse, we were detaineduntill near noon. There was some murmuringamong the brotherin; many wished to goon, and not tarry with the rest of the companyfor the day; and some had already started.I sent for them to return, and called thewhole camp together and instructed themnot to scatter. I told them if they wentahead of the camp in a scattered conditionthey whould become weary, lie down on 
 the ground, when their blood was hotand very likely to take diseases such asague, fever and fever which is perverted in thisclimate, as they ought never to lie on theground, (which is alwase) damp) when their bloodwas hot, they whould also be in danger ofbeing killed by our enemies, and none ofus be the wiser for it. I then proposed for adiversion, that we divide the camp intothree parts, and have a sham battle, whichwas agreed to by all. Brother Roger Ortonlead one part; Fredrick G. Willams anotherdivision; and I remain in camp with third division. They returned to the woodswith their divisions, and soon attacted thecamp, which we defended by various manuversfor some time many of our Captains showedconsiderable tact, and was more acquaintedwith miletary matters, than I had expected.Every thing went off with good feeling, althoughcaptain Heber C. Kimble in receving a chargegrasped captain Lewis Zabriskie's sword andin indeavering to take it from him hadthe skin cut from the paum of his hand.After the sham battle was over, I called thecamp together, and cautioned them to becareful in the future, and controal their spirits 
 in such circumstances so as not to injur each other. We traveled acrast the prairie, andencamped in a strip of timber, where westopped to dine. I wrote a letter to the brotherinin Missouri (dated camp of Israel) requestingsome of them to meet us as soon possiable,and give us information of the state of thingsin upper Missouri; and sent the letter toSpringfield Post-Office, by Dr Willams. At thisplace I discovered that part of my companyhad been served with sower bread whileI had received good sweet bread from thesame cook. I reproved Br. Zebrada Coltrinfor partiality, for I wanted my brotherinto fair as well as I did. (The brotherin inClay County wrote the following letterto his Excellency Danial Dunkin, Liberty,Missouri May the 29th, 1834 Sir. (copy the letterfrom page 317 A. No. 2)May 30, 1834 ~ FridayFriday the 30thFredrick G. Willams and Almon W. Babbetwent ahead into Springfield in disguiseto learn the feelings of the people, andprocure some powder. We passed throughSpringfield our appearance excited considerablecuriosity, and a great many questionswere asked, the spies who had followed us 
 so long pursued in very closely, changeingtheir dress and horses several times a day.Brother Eleazer Miller with others joined thecompany with three horses about noon, alittle east of Rochester. This recrute wasvery seasonable as many of our horses wereafflicted as they very frequently were inchanging country climate and food.Many of the horses after eating dry cornand prairie grass would be served withcolic cholic, and bloat very badly. BrotherEzra Thayer administered a medacinemixed in a great stone bottle, preparedas follows, a three penny paper of tobbacco,half an ounce of copperns, and twotable spoons full of cayenne pepper, andthe bottle filled with water when he couldnot whisky, one half of a bottle constitutesa dose and whould unvariably cure asick horse in a few minutes and isworthy of rememberance. Br Thayer calledhis medicine 18 by 24. We encamped about threemiles from Springfield on Springfield creek.F. G. Willams and A. M. Babbet returnedto the camp with two kegs of powder, andreported, that the people were somewhat excited,more however from a cureosity to know 
 where we were gowing than from a desire tohinder us. A brother came to see us with newsthat my brother Hiram had passed on westthe day before with a company about fiftymiles north of us and saying "he has a fine company,and they all look mighty pert." I asked him toaccompany us to Missouri, he replied "I cannot."He went and stayed with the spies at a tavernover night, who said they had followed us threehundred miles on purpose to take some advan-tage of us. May 31, 1834 ~ SaturdaySaturday 31st.In the morning this same brother came to meand said, "I whould be mighty glad to go withyou, but my business is such I cannot; willa hundred dollars do you any good." I replied"Yes it will, for we are short of money" He ame-diately mounted his horse and rode towardsSpringfield, and within an hour after the camphad started, he returned and said to me "Iam mighty sorry I cannot go with youhere is a hundred dollars, and if I had, hada few days notice I whould halve got more."At noon we halted for dinner. A man apparentlydrunk, came to the camp and said he hada large farm fourty cows, a little way aheadand if we whould go there, he whould giveus all we wanted to eat and drink, feed our 
 horses ect, ect, but I soon discovered that he wasmore sober than drunk, and that he was probablya spy. Near night we arrived at a small streamof water about one mile from Jacksonvill wherewe found a paw paw bush in the road,which had been dropped as a signal forus to camp, by Dr. F. G. Willams, whom Ihad sent forward in the morning on horse-back, to select a camp ground and watchthe movements of our enemies. Here we pitchedour tents agreeably to my instruction aboutsunset. Brother Roger Norton proclaimed about,that there whould be preaching under the trees,within the camp at half past ten on the morrow.There was only one stranger in the camp tohear the appointment, Dr. Willams hadgone on to Jacksonville with his pill bagsto spend the nightJune 1, 1834 ~ SundaySunday, June the 1st.This morning at half past ten oclock, ourtrumpet (a common brass french horn) sound-ed in the camp for preaching, there were sometwo of three of the people from Jacksonville, andthe surrounding country gathered under the treeswithin our camp, and a chest was brought outfor the accomodation of the speaker, when squireCook (as I was called) amediately took the stand
