 252  EDITORIAL. THE CONTRIBUTOR.A MONTHLY MAGAZINEJUNIUS F. WELLS,EDITOR AND PUBLISHER.TERMS:Two Dollars a Year, -  In Advance.Single Copy, Twenty Cents.SALT LAKE CITY, -  August, 1880.THE PIONEERS.NOTHING in the grand celebration on the Twenty-fourth was more interestingthan the remnant of the heroic companyof Pioneers, which appeared in the pro-cession. There were not many of them,but those who did attend, presented theappearance of true heroes, and coura-geous leaders, who braved the dangersof the desert to make homes in a barrenwilderness for their friends and theirposterity, and to unfurl the banner ofreligious liberty upon the mountains asan ensign to the nations. Too much can-not be said in praise of the Pioneers.They should be held in honored remem-brance by their children and by the resi-dents of our Territory. Their namesshould be committed to memory by theyouth of Zion, and made as imperishablein our hearts as the glorious deeds theyhave done are imperishable.Elder Wilford Woodruff's speech de-livered in the Tabernacle includedthe following brief sketch of theirentrance into Great Salt Lake Valley,and tribute of respect to those who havedied, and words of encouragement to the surviving members of the honored band.THE ADDRESS.We now come to the Pioneers, in honorof whom we have got up this great cele-bration to-day. In consequence of sick-ness, President Young and the mainbody of the pioneer camp rested east ofthe Wasatch Mountains, and on the 13thof July, 1847, Orson Pratt was appointedto take some twenty-three wagons andforty-two men, and go in advance tomake a road over the mountains. Theycut a road through thick groves of quak-ing aspen and bear swales. Orson Prattand Erastus Snow entered this valleyahead of their own company on the 21stof July. They had a fine view of thevalley and returned to camp in the even-ing, one and a half miles up EmigrationCañon.On the 22d, Orson Pratt, George A.Smith and seven others rode into thevalley, leaving their camp to follow andwork the road. President Young beingsick, I was carrying him on a bed madeup in my carriage, and we camped with the main body of the company on EastCañon Creek.On the 23d, the remainder of OrsonPratt's advance company entered thevalley, founded an encampment, andcommenced to plow the ground. I crossedthe mountains that day with PresidentYoung and his part of the company, andcamped about six miles from the mouthof Emigration Cañon. We found an ex-ceedingly rough road in passing throughthe stumps of the trees that the advancecompany had cut.On the 24th I drove my carriage, withPresident Young lying on a bed in it,into the open valley, the rest of the com-pany following. When we came out ofthe cañon into full view of the valley, Iturned the side of my carriage around,open to the west, and President Youngarose from his bed and took a survey of the country. While gazing upon thescene before us, he was enwrapped in vision for several minutes. He had seenthe valley before in vision, and upon thisoccasion he saw the future glory of Zionand of Israel, as they would be, plantedin the valleys of these mountains. Whenthe vision had passed, he said: "It isenough. This is the right place. Driveon." So I drove to the encampmentalready formed by those who had comealong in advance of us.

You must have had a fatiguing trip. Ifthe weather where you have been has been anything like what we have had in this Citysince you left and almost up to the date of your letter, you have had pleasant, coolweather for your journey. Within a few days the summer has burst upon us and we are now having as hot weather as is usual at this time of the year.We have been busy since your departure attending tomatters which have arisen connected with the Church ssuit. There is a feeling atthe present time in the Council to endeavor, if we can, to effect some sort of a set-tlement, to stop the proceedings before the Examiner. The manner in which the breth-ren have failed under the examination of the U.S. District attorney has caused us allto feel that if we can by any means stop future proceedings in this direction withouttoo great a sacrifice, we shall willingly do so. Whether we will be successful ornot remains to be seen; but negotiations are now in progress looking to this end.Brothers Joseph F. Smith, F. S. Richards and C. W. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 19, 1888.Elder Brigham Young,Salt Lake City,Dear Brother: Our attention has been repeatedly called to the apathy and indifference of our people in regard to their politicalrights; while, on the other hand, our enemies were never so well organezed, so thoroughand united, nor more determined in their opposition than now.The experiences that we have had in the "irrepressible conflict" between theChurch and Kingdom of God and the world, from the days of Ohio, Missouri and Illinoisdown to the recent experiences of our disfranchised people in Idaho, proves beyonddoubt that the "price of liberty", to us, "is eternal vigilance", and implicit reliance upon the protection and mercy of Almighty God.The malignant animus and the wicked purposes of our relentless foes were not more apparent in the mobbings and drivings from Missouri, or the martyrdom of ourProphets and the expulsion of the Saints from Illinois than they were in the infa-mous propositions embodied in the Edmunds and the Edmunds-Tucker laws, the appoint-ment of the Utah Commission and other Territorial and local officers to rule over us,the confiscation of our property, and many other things open to the view of all thepeople, which are in themselves mild and humane in comparison to measures which havebeen proposed to Congress for the destruction of our rights and liberty, as Latter-day Saints, and the subjugation of the Church of God, which have not as yet crystaliz-ed into penal statutes against us. Among them the proposition to compel wives totestify against their husbands, and to make the status of polygamy, as well as the acta crime punishable with excessive penalities, to disfranchise all Mormons and the utter

The Councildecided to appropriate $1000.00, to be apportioned byyou between Brother E. A. Tietjin and one other suit-able Elder whom you would designate as his compan-ion. It was felt that you were in a position toknow who the other person would be and what pro-portion of the $1000.00 each should have, and this is 
 EDITORIAL. 253When we arrived on the ground, thebrethren had commenced ploughing. Ihad brought a bushel of potatoes withme, and I resolved that I would neithereat nor drink until I had planted them. Igot them into the ground by one o'clock,and these, with the potatoes that theother brethren had planted, became thefoundation for the future potato crops ofUtah.In the evening, in company with HeberC. Kimball, George A. Smith and E. T.Benson, I rode up City Creek Cañon to look for timber. While there we had athunder shower, and the rain reachednearly over the whole valley.The following day, the 25th, was thefirst Sabbath that the Saints of God everspent in these valleys of the mountains,and George A. Smith preached the first sermon ever delivered here, followed byHeber C. Kimball and Ezra T. Bensonin the forenoon, and W. Woodruff, O.Pratt and W. Richards in the afternoon.President Young, though feeble, closedby giving good advice to the Saints. Hedesired them not to work, fish, hunt orplay on Sunday, but go to meeting andworship God. They must keep the com-mandments of God, or not dwell with us,and no man should by or sell land, butall should have what they could cultivatefree, and no man should possess thatwhich was not his own.On Monday, the 26th, President Youngand the Twelve went up Ensign Peak,and he said there was a proper place toraise an ensign to the nations. So wenamed it Ensign Peak. I was the firstperson that stood on the top of it. Wealso visited the Hot and Warm Springs.On the 27th, President Young withfourteen others, eight of them being ofthe Twelve, crossed the Jordan and wentwest to Black Rock, which we walked todry shod, where to-day our trail is cov-ered with some ten feet of water. Pres-ident Young was the first of the Pioneers that touched the salt water. We re-turned to the point of the mountain andcamped for the night.On the morning of the 28th we returnedto our encampment on the site of thiscity, accompanied by some of the nativeUtes, the first we had seen. After wehad arrived at our encampment, Presi-dent Young had a council with theTwelve, and took a walk about our en-campment. He then stopped, stuck hiscane down, and said: "Here will be theTemple of our God." This was aboutthe centre of the site of the Temple weare building upon this block. It wasthen decided by vote that we lay out thecity of Great Salt Lake, with its blocks,lots and streets, much as it stands thisday. Upon this interesting occasion,President Young delivered a very inter-esting address, which I recorded in my journal.We spent thirty-three days in the Val-ley of the Great Salt Lake, laid out acity, and built a fort covering ten acres,the east side enclosed with log houses,and the other three sides with adobiewalls.On the 26th of August, we bid fare-well to the few left in the valley, a por-tion of whom belonged to the MormonBattalion, and, being sick, were left be-hind by the Battalion.When we arrived in this valley wefound it a barren desert, and a very des-ert it was. There was no mark of thewhite man. We found a few naked In-dians, who would eat a pint of roastedcrickets for their dinner. But a greatchange has come over this desert. Ageneration has passed. Eight of thequorum of the Twelve Apostles whowere then living, and most of themamong the Pioneers, are now in the spiritworld. Orson Pratt, Erastus Snow andmyself are the only ones living who wereamong the Pioneers and in the Quorumof the Twelve at that time. Truly then we found a barren desert. To-day Istand in a tabernacle filled with some tenthousand of the Latter-day Saints whohave followed the Pioneers into these valleys of the mountains. When wecast our eyes over these valleys, then a

 they were furnished with, would enable them to accom-plish a great work among these peoples.The Council of the Apostles, taking intoconsideration these circumstances, have appropriated$70000 from the tithing of St. Johns, Snowflake andSan Juan Stakes. This amount is to be added tothe $100000 already appropriated to that mission,and of which you have received notice. It is expect-ed that this $70000, added to the previous $100000, willsupply the necessary funds to carry on the laborin this mission for about one year. These fundswill be expended under your direction, and byapplying to Bro. James Jack, who has been notifiedof the appropriation, you will be able to draw itas you may need.The committee to whom our Indianaffairs were referred have recommended that a mis-sion be established among the Utes and have forits base Mancos and Bluff City.

We, as pio-neers and as the people of God, are ful-filling prophecy and making history.This tabernacle in which we are to-day,is the very tabernacle that Isaiah saw invision twenty-six hundred years ago,that should be as a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and a covert from thestorm and from the rain. We are alsobuilding the temple of our God, on thisblock, which the prophet saw was to bebuilt in the last days upon the mountainsof the Lord's house, and be establishedon the tops of the mountains, for allpeople to flow unto. Isaiah ii, 2, 3. "Andmany people shall go and say, Come ye,and let us go up to the mountain of theLord, to the house of the God of Jacob;and he will teach us of his ways, and wewill walk in his paths; for out of Zionshall go forth the law, and the word ofthe Lord from Jerusalem." Our wholelife, history, and travels have been point-ed out by the ancient prophets. As the pioneers came into this barren desertand the Saints have followed them tofulfill the prophecies to make the desertblossom as the rose, to sow our grain be-side all small streams and still waters,and to use the fir, the pine, and the box,to beautify the place of God's sanctuaryand to make the place of his feet glorious,and as there is but a remnant of us left asPioneers, or Battalion, or Zion's Camp,let us magnify our calling and build upthe Zion and Kingdom of God until it isperfected before the heavens and theearth, and not disappoint those who sentus, nor those who have seen us by visionand revelation, but let us finish and fulfillour destiny to the satisfaction of ourheavenly Father, his angels, and allgood men.

Everything is moving alongvery quietly at present. A report, however, has reachedus that the Marshal intends to change the arrange-ment which he has with his deputies, and instead ofgiving them a salary, to give them a commission onthe work they do. If this be true, and they shouldoperate hereafter upon that principle, we may reasonablyexpect more activity on their part in their efforts to dis-cover those under indictment, or against whom theymay hope to be successful in bringing in convictions.We are expecting Brother John H.

Brother ThalesHaskell, who is a very excellent interpreter, and whohas had a great deal of experience among the UteIndians, is now located at Bluff City, in San JuanStake. It is thought that he might be madevery useful in dealing with the Lamanites and inteaching them and bringing them into greater har-mony with us and also with true civilization. Itshould be the effort of our people to not only baptizeand confirm the Lamanites, who will receive theGospel, into the Church, but, as soon as possible, or-ganize them into Branches and instruct them inthe principles of true religion, and impart unto themalso the arts of true civilization. They are in avery degraded, lamentable condition.

 Penrose reached the City last Sunday in good health and spirits. They had an in-teresting time in Washington and feel well concerning the result of their labors.Brother Richards has seen every Senator but one, and Brother Penrose has been with him most of the time; and they have been together in visiting a great number of the leading Representatives. They have done good missionary work and have given a great amount of information to all with whom they have conversed concerning the situation of our affairs, and it is but reasonable to expect that great good has been done.  There is a general softening of feeling towards Utah, they say. Brother John T. Caine writes also, in a letter which we received yesterday, to the effect that he has never been treated with greater courtesy than at the present time, and there is no spirit of hatred manifested by public men. It seems as though the time has come of which mention has been made when the Lord would soften the hearts of our enemies. We trust this softening process will continue until we shall regain our liberty and be free from the annoyances to which we have been subjected so long. There will doubtless be lulls in the storm, of which we can take advantage.Brother Lyman came back to the City a few days ago. He is well.The Board of Education met a week ago, and a reso-lution was adopted to request the Presidency of each Stake to select a Board ofEducation for the Stake of suitable men who had the educational interests of the 
 demolition of our church organizations.As an evidence of what would result from falling into the hands of our ene-mies, of the few rights left us, we need only to look to the treatment of our peoplein Idaho where, so far as possible, every vestige of political rights and freedom havebeen denied them because of their belief in and connection with the Church.There has been suggested to us on several occasions by persons who thinkthey are friends of the people, the subject of political iorganizations in this Terri-tory, having in view a change from the People's party to those known as the national parties—Democrats and Republicans. Situated as we are we have deemed such a step tobe very unwise. When advances of this character have been made by some of our peo-ple in good faith, how have they been treated? The Territorial convention of Demo-crats, called under the authorization of the National Democratic Committee, that metat Ogden in May, 1888, at which time and in which convention the efforts of some mem-bers of the People's party to unite with them on democratic principles, were so shame-fully treated, and those making the effort were grossly insulted.It should not be forgotten that those calling themselves Democrats andRepublicans and Liberals have ever and all the time united against the majority ofthe people of this Territory; they will ewen obliterate party lines for this purpose,and always and everywhere speak of our people—the People's party—as political heri-tics.Pending the time when all who love liberty aod the rights of their fellow-men may unite on a platform of equal jusitce, we urge the importance of prompt actionand constant effort to strengthen the rank and dile of the People's party, always a-voiding the unwise policy of urging for office or position those who have not theconfidence and respect of the people and, possibly, otherwise unqualified for the suf-frages of the legal voters.

 stand united, though we are not numerically strong, ourinfluence is felt and respected. Then in whatever directionwe may choose to vote we will carry with us theproper influence.Respecting the appropriation for the threemissionaries among the Navajoes, you will doubtless re-member that the matter was before the Council andas soon as possible it will receive consideration.We think you are quite justified in send-ing the brethren as you propose, to prevent misunder-standing between the natives and our people at Moen-coppy. We should do everything in our power toavoid any irritation arising between the Lamanites andourselves, and no pains should be spared to preventthe secret machinations of bad white men from havingtheir effect against us upon the Indian mind.Since my last to you there has nothingparticularly new transpired, though how soon theremay be now that Dyer has returned we cannot say.We are having winter weather now, and better health,we think, is prevailing.

The information you give con-cerning the circumstances of the family of Brother Gilbert Greer will be con-sidered and acted upon in some form as soon as possible.The suggestions which you make about someoneattending the Stake Conferences at Snowflake and St. Johns have been taken intoconsideration, and I have just written to Brother John Henry Smith, requestinghim, if convenient, to attend those conferences, and have also written to BishopR.

Brother Burton has had considerable experience in matters of this char-acter in the past and will be a wise counselor and pacificator with Brother JohnHenry in bringing about harmonious conclusions among the brethren of the twoStakes. It is very desirable that we should avoid anything like conflict ordivision in our political matters, as it would have a tendency to weaken us anddestroy our union.

 The apathy and careless indifference of the people at the last election forDelegate to Congress shows the great necessity for prompt action on the part of the law-abiding citizens of the Territory.Without multiplying words I think it necessary that these matters should pe [be]taken in hand by the Apostles, the Presidents of Stakes, the Bishops and all the El-ders in Israel, with a view if awakening the Saints and all friends of human rightsto a realizing sense of the dangers which threaten us through the negligence, care-lessness and indifference of the people to the dangers which threaten them, but whichmay be averted or at least postponed by reasonable diligence on their part. For while we should always rely fully in our faith and confidence, in the mercies of God,the folly of indifference, neglect of other duties or idleness must be apparent toevery rational mind.It is therefore desired that the Apostles, so far as possible, will use duediligence in bringing this subject, in the wisdom and discretion of their high call-ing, as prominetly as the Spirit in wisdom dictates through them before the Stakeand Ward authorities, ar [and] also the Quorums of the priesthood and the Saints as they vis-it among the people.With kind regards,I am,Your Brother,W Woodruff 
 Dec. 15, 1890.George C. Unglish,Fairport, Monroe Co, N. Y.Dear Sir:Your letter of the 12th inst. is received, and in reply will say, thatAsa Woodruff, of whom you speak, is not my brother. I had one cousin in Avonby the name of John, who was the son of Ozen Woodruff.

Richards has returned from Washing-ton and brings us the intelligence that the acting Attorney General, in thecase submitted to him, has decided that the Temple Block in this city and theCouncil House corner shall be left free from molestation; but that the TithingOffice property, the Gardo House and the Historian Office shall be submittedto the court, for it to decide as to the ownership, whether it shall go to theReceiver or be turned back to us. In the case of the Church Pasture, also,there will be a suit at law to decide upon that, the facts connected therewithbeing agreed to by both parties and submitted to the court for decision. Thegovernment also claim, through the Receiver, the Cove Creek Ranch; and $5000.00more is to be paid to quiet the title of the stock of the Deseret News Co. whichwas transferred by President Taylor to the Literary and Scientific Association.The other temples and the meeting-houses are not officially noticed, the under-standing being that the title has never been in the Trustee-in-Trust and there-fore they never have belonged to the corporation, and the acting Attorney Generalthought they could not be claimed by the Receiver.

 OFFICE OF The First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus Christof Latter-day SaintsP. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 14, 1894. 189Mrs. Leonora Hatch Savage,Woodruff, Arizona.Dear Sister:I was pleased to learn from your letter of 5th inst. ofyour welfare and prosperity, and how greatly the Lord had blessed youin your family. I trust that His mercies will continue with you withincreasing manifestations of His love and watchcare toward you, His handmaid.Regarding the questions that you ask, I will say the teach-ings of the Church have ever been strongly in favor of moderation inall things. Temperance, soberness and chastity are esteemed among itscardinal virtues. This moderation should characterize the intercourseof husbands and wives as well as the other actions of our lives. Many evils have undoubtedly been wrought in the world by excesses of everykind, certainly not excepting those that deal with the fountains oflife; and we all, as members of Christ's Church, should endeavor toapproach the perfect law. as nearly as possible, striving to overcomethe weaknesses of our natures by the aid of that Divine Spirit which ispromised to all the children of obedience. These remarks will give youmy general ideas with regard to the subjects on which Sister Sorenseontreats. I do not wish to be too rigid in asserting the law, knowingthe weaknesses of humanity.May the Lord lead you in the way of truth is the prayer ofYour Brother, Wilford Woodruff

 HOLINESS TO THE LORDSalt Lake Temple.Box 1228. Salt Lake City, Utah, 8 May 1898Lydia L. Savage,Dear Sister: In answer toquestions contained your letter of May 30thI have to say:It was recently decided by the councilof the First Presidency and Twelve Apostlesthat children (deceased) should havereached the age of 14 years before they should be endowed for.In relation to sick children, itis proper to adhere to the revelations,which directs that the Elders should becalled in that they may administerthe ordinance ordained for the benefitof the sick. It is not improper, however,for sisters to administer to the sick children,but this should not be done by authority of the Priesthood. 
 Historian's Office,P.O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 5, 1887.President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother:Prof. White, Princi-pal of the Deaf Mute Dep't. of theUniversity called and handedme the enclosed communicationand requested me to forward thesame to you accompanied bya few lines from myself. Beingsomewhat familiar with the classof unfortunates of whom he speaksand represents, I take pleasurein responding to his request, feel-ing that if there is any portionof the common wealth who needthe sympathy and support ofthe community, it is certainlythose who are deprived of a portionof their senses as these people are.I understand from the last census that there are considerablyover one hundred deaf mutes inthe Territory. The general schooltaxes of the Territory does not benefit 
 Salt Lake CitySept 5th 1887President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Sir:It is in yourpower to be of great service toa helpless class in the community,a class that more than any otherpeople needs the benefits of an education which areis to fit themfor lives of usefulness in thishard world of ours, and I amnot without hope from my slightpersonal acquaintance with yourkindness of heart and gentlenessof disposition that you will grant the favor which I am going to askfor the sake of the unfortunatechildren in my care.When the Legislative Assembly of 1884 voted an annual approp-riation of $2000.00 for the education of the deaf mutes in the Territory, no provision wasmade, probably from an oversight,for the establishment of an institutesuch as is absolutely necessary forthe best development of the Deaf,mentally, morally and socially.The need of such an adjunct to the school was evident to the Board of 
 Fillmore City, Sept. 1882Bro. Woodruff:I saw and read your notice to the surviving members ofZion's camp; and also the editor's remarks on the subject; and afterpondering the matter over, I came to the conclusion that I couldnot throw any a ditional light on the travels of Zion's Camp, tothat which Joseph the Prophet wrote, as published in the fifteenthvolume of the Millenial Star. This being the case, I consideredmyself perfectly excuseable; but some of my brethren thoughtdifferent, who said that inciedents which occurred prior and afterwardsin consequence of the camp, were connected with the travels of theCamp; and strongly urged me to contribute to the work which youhave taken up. So I have resolved to write and leave it to yourdisposal; to use a part or all or none, and if convenient return it to me when you are done with it.Some peculiar and thrilling incidents occured in my earlylife, which might be interesting to the reader of history, and as somehave remarked; if I had not been born and reared I should not havebeen a member of Zion's Camp.Very Respectfully,"Nathan B. Baldwin" 
 CopyFriday, March, 19th, 1897.Preidents Woodruff and Cannon at theoffice.President Woodruff again spoke into the graphaphone or talkingmachine, repeating what he said on the 12th inst., as recorded inthis journal. The object of the repetition was to obtain, oif possible, better results than wasere obtained on the previous occasion.In order to procure President Woodruff's signature to the testi-money he bears, it is herewith repeated and signed by himself:"I bear my testimony that the Prophet Joseph Smith said, before a large assemblage in Illinois, that if he were the emperor of the world and had control over the whole human family he would sustainevery man, woman and child in the enjoyment of their religion.Those are my sentitments today.I bear my testimony that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, ordained of God to lay the foundation of his church and king-dom in the last dispensation of the fulness of times.I bear my testimony that in the early spring of 1844, inNauvoo, the Prophet Joseph Smith called the Twelve Apostles togetherand he delivered unto them the ordinances of the Church and kingdomof God; and all the keys and powers that God had bestowed upon him,he sealed upon our heads, and he told us that we must round up ourshoulders and bear off this kingdom, or we would be damned. I amthe only man now living in the flesh who heard that testimony fromhis mouth, and I know that it was true by the power of God manifestto him. At that meeting he stood on his feet for about three hoursand taught us the things of the kingdom. His face was as clear asamber, and he was covered with a power that I had never seen in any man in the flesh before.I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was the author of the en-dowment as received by the Latter-day Saints. I received my ownendowments under his hands and direction, and I know they are trueprinciples. I not only received my own endowments under his hands, but I bear my testimony that Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,Willard Richards, George A. Smith, John Taylor and other brethrenreceived their endowments under the hands and direction of theProphet Joseph; and also my wife Phoebe, Bathsheba Smith, LeonoraTaylor, Mary Smith and others whose names I cannot recall now.The Prophet Joseph laid down his life for the word of God andtestimony of Jesus Christ, and he will be crowned as a martyr in the presence of God and the Lamb.In all his testimoniees to us the power of God was visibly man-ifest with the Prophet Joseph.This is my testimony, spoken by myself into a talking machineon this th 19th day of March, 1897, in the 91st year of my age."WILFORD WOODRUFF.

BrotherRichards thinks, however, that Mr Peters will not be ready by that time.We have had some hot weather here, but variedoccasionally by cool days and nights. During this week we have had one or twovery cool nights, and since I last wrote to you we have had some very refreshingshowers, which were gratefully received.Our election has just passed off, and with theusual hubbub on the part of the Liberals, who have done their best, especiallyin this city, to gain their ends. Our ticket, however, with the exception of theFifth District, has been elected. Brother Pyper as Justice of the Peace, andCharles Crow as Constable, were defeated in the Fifth District, and the twoLiberals were elected.For about a month past Brother Joseph F. Smithhas been severely attacked with lumbago and sciatica. We have not seen himduring that period. He has been confined most of the time to his house, andpart of it to his bed. We hear, however, that he is now improving.With love, in which Brother Geo. Q. joins, andpraying the Lord to bless you,I remain, Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff

The Board re-commended the needs of theDepartment to the last Legislaturein 1886 and an increase of approp-riation together with an under-standing that the University shouldprovide quarters for the accom-modation of our pupils wasthe result but unfortunately,the veto of Gov. Murray destroyedour only means of support.In our time of distress, the Boardgenerously voted to maintain the Department for deaf mutesas before, but nothing could bedone officially for the establish-ment of an institute. In the meantime, all our old pupilshad returned to school and therewere many others anxious toeat the crumbs of education ifany could be obtained. As manyof them come from distant parts of the Territory, you can understand that it would not have been goodpolicy to allow them to board among strangers who would have no interest 
 this class of individuals, for theydo not nor can they attend thedistrict or common schools, butthey are entirely dependent fortheir education upon special do-nation and appropriations.I know from observation thatthese people can be made useful and independent citizens if theyare properly educated. I would,therefore (not wishing to be in theleast presumptuous) recommendthat if any accommodation can be ex-tended to Prof. White and his goodlady for the benefit of these poor un-fortunate fellow beings, via of lettingthem occupy the large "Cannon House,"or a portion of it, for a temporary residenceand school, such favor granted will notonly be duly appreciated by them, but,in my opinion, be looked upon by thepublic as a magnanimous act on thepart of our Church.As usual, things here at the officeare sliding along smoothly, etc.Ever praying for your welfare andprotection, I am, as ever,Your brother in the Gospel,Milando Pratt

It is not necessary to explain this matter further: youas a parent and as the father of the Church can understand andsympathize with the parents ofsuch children.There was but one course left tous in such circumstancesand with the approval of theBoard, my wife and myselfwent to work and kept up aninstitute during last year.

 pectfully refer you to the lastAnnual Report of President J. K. Park, than whom none was betterqualified to judge upon sucha subject.The house which we occupied lastyear was a large frame house,inconvenient in many respectsfor the proper regulation of ourhousehold, but it was the best thatwe could secure. The house however proved to be damp and unhealthyto such an extent that our pupilssuffered from colds and rheum-atic fevers and our own baby, the only one we have and the only joyof our existence came near beingcarried away by bronchial pneumoniain that house and my wife was obligedto live in one room in the nextbrick cottage. After the close of school, the owner tried to rentthe house to other people but itsreputation for unhealthinesswas such that none would takeit and to-day, it is still tenant-less. Need I say that responsibleas I am for the health of the un-fortunate children under mycharge, I cannot and must not go back to such a dangerous place?

I wasglad to see you have so much. I called at your house a shorttime since, and was in your garden with sister Rich—she gaveme some heads of her Australian wheat, which much resemblesbarley in appearance, but when thrashed is a fine looking grain.I am taking good care of it for seed. Sister Rich was well. James Townsend has returned from California and Carson Valley, and givesa bad report of both places—he preached last Sunday upon the subject.We are having a very dry season, and have hard work to save ourcrops—there is but very little water. We are almost universally in themidst of our wheat harvest; I shall raise wheat enough to bread myfamily this year, and perhaps a little more. We are all well exceptingthat I am suffering with the rhuematism. I should be pleased tohear from you at any time. I am trying to get some good apples and other fruit from abroad to improve my orchards as far Ias Ican; if you can help me any in it I should be thankful.Yours truly,W. Woodruff.

 Yet, to this necessity am I reducedfor the want of a suitable buildingelsewhere. When I think of it, I am filled with despair. I have looked through the whole neighborhoodof the University for a house butthere is none that I could get for[lone] or money. The Ellerbeck family owns a fine place but they wouldnot rent it to us for less thanone hundred dollars ($100) per month. Of course, that is out ofthe question.There is but one other place whichwe could obtain if you are willingand that is Mr. Geo. Q.

Many good peoplehave asked us why we did nottry to get permission to occupythis house as it is useless forany other purposes and is fastgoing to ruin. Let us but have theright to occupy it and we will takebetter care of the property so thatit will not be injured in our hands.

 Apostle Woodruff said he was muchpleased to meet so many of the Saintsin conference. Naturally the peopleliked to be out taking care of the grain:considered it quite a marvel to see theimmense crops of grain and other pro-ducts. But it is right to attend con-ference and all the other duties.God would disapppoint no one in relation to any promise hehas made either in relation to famineor other calamity or judgment that hasbeen foretold. He referred to the dis-persion of the Jews and the causesthat led thereto; said the like causeswere operating in this nation whichtramples under foot its own laws inorder to persecute the Latter-daySaints. Many had already suffered death, because of their belief in God,under this the most liberal governmenton earth, while at the same time nosuch deeds had been enacted underany of the kingly governments of Eu-rope, who made no such pretensions toliberty and freedom. He believed that Utah to-day would have been a wil-derness had it not been for the restora-tion of the Gospel.

 Apostle Woodruff said this is a Tem-ple building dispensation. More laborin this respect is required of the Latter-day Saints than has been required ofany people since the days of Adam.He dwelt upon the great labors to beperformed in the redemption of thedead, reviewed to some extent the labors of President Brigham Youngin dedicating this land forthe settlements of the Saints, hishaving dedicated every place in thesevalleys whereon Temples have been built, or are now in course oferection; gave a brief synopsis of someof the labors in the St. George Tem-ple—a sacred edifice erected, as someof the brethren declared, in a countrythat stands upon its edge. He related how kindly the Lord had led the Pro-phet along step by step, until the planfor the redemption of the dead wasfully revealed. Thought that no doubtthere would shortly follow in the tracks of those who had been slain, aset of Elders whom the mob could notvery well withstand; who will havecontrol of the elements, and by and by the Savior will come and bind that oldserpent, the Devil, and place a sealupon him which will remain a thous-and years, during which time the re-demption of the dead will proceed. 
 The house belongs to the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter Day Saintsand you, as the President, havethe power of disposing of it as you think necessary, for, so I havebeen told, and I hope for the sake of the others that you willfind it possible to grant theuse of it to the Department forDeaf Mutes. We paid $20.00 per month rent for the other houselast year and will be able to pay a little more for the Cannonplace if you say so. Any conditionsor restrictions you may see fit to place upon us will be faithfullycarried out. As every day adds tothe perplexities of our situation, willyou be ^so^ kind enough ^as^ to return an answer at your earliest convenience.The use of the house is only to betemporary. As soon as we can getour appropriation that may be votedto our school next Winter, we willprobably have an institution builtupon the University grounds for theaccomodation of all the un-educated deaf mutes in the Territory.May I hope that this appeal for human-ity's sake maywill not fail?Yours with Respect and ConsiderationHenry C.

 In Camp, Head Waters Weber River,Utah Territory, August 24th, 1892.EDITOR FOREST AND STREAM:I peruse "Forest and Stream" with much interest: it cer-contains a great amount of valuable information.I was born on the 1st day of March 1807, at Avon, Hartford County, Conn.,on the banks of a trout brook which had turned the wheels of a flour milland a saw mill, owned by my grandfather and father, for many years. Assoon as I was old enough to carry a fish-rod I commenced catching trout,which I have continued to do, from time to time, for nearly 80 years.Several years of my life were spent in Ashland, Oswego Co., New York, onthe east border of Lake Ontario. While there I assisted, one morning incatching 500 salmon, very few of which were under 20 pounds, while a fewweighed 40 pounds. My first experience in fishing with fly for trout andsalmon was in England and Scotland in 1845; but I met with little success ^there.^At the time of the early settlement of Utah Territory, the mountainsand canyons were thickly inhabited with the elk, deer, antelope, panther,mountain lion, wild cat, and grizzly, cinnamon and brown bear; some of whichwere of immense size. These animals are still found in our mountains, andare frequently killed. I never shot a bear, although I have seen quite anumber of grizzly and cinnamon bears after they were killed. In one in-stance a very large grizzly, with two large cubs, passed within 30 yards ofme while I was concealed in the brush. I was, at the time, holding in myhands, a muzzle-loading gun, and the manner she treated her cubs, while ap-parently trying to wean them, plainly indicated the wisdom of my lettingher pass unmolested, and assured me if I should fail to kill her the first

 shot, she would attack and kill me. Hardly half a mile after passingshe came upon a camp, some of the men fired at her several times but shegot away, with her cubs. I have killed deer and antelope but never elkalthough upon one occasion a band of more than 200 came within 300 yardsof me, and were headed towards me, but were frightened off in another direc-tion by a man without a gun who came running to see me shoot an elk a com-panion hunter, however, shot and killed one of them. We think deer are in-creasing in our region. A good many elk and sheep are still in our moun-tains, but difficult to get at. Deer, antelope and elk are quite plentifulnorth of us, in the Snake River country, now Idaho, and moose are taken oc-casionally. Some six years ago I met a young man up there who shot 16elk and 2 moose out of one band, and he said he might have killed more, butin doing would only have been to waste them.Now concerning the trout of Utah, I will say that Utah, Bear, Panguichand Trial lake as well as other lakes, rivers and streams abound with thelargest and finest trout; when we first reached [light srebarrow] out [bassins]country has become settled they that [atsidess] has [insigns] of [aswenemits]supply quite an amount of trout [9 illegible words] warm day in June, I helped to make a haul [7 illegible words]trout having gathered about the river [6 illegible words]men had made several hauls during the day [5 illegible words] 500 pounds of fish and when the [illegible] I [5 illegible words]about 1000 pounds. great [8 illegible words] the scales.

 Trout and salmon have been successfully hatched here, under the super-vision of Hon. A. P. Rockwood, who is now dead; the eggs having been suppliedby the late Fish Commissioner, Seth Green. The fry were put into Utah Lakeand the tributaries of Bear Lake. Mr. A. M. Musser, our local Fish Commis-sioner, about three years ago, put into Utah Lake, 1,000,000 shad fry, and Iam happy to say that this effort to stock Utah Lake with shad bids fair tobe a success. Although this fish are as yet protected by law, some ofthem, on one occasion, found their way to the market and weighed two and ahalf pounds. I assisted Mr. Rockwood, several years before, to put in ourriver Jordan 5000 shad fry, but the venture was not a success.About 12 years ago I visited Bear River valley and fished 4 hours ina creek leading into Bear River, with a rod and reel, and caught 20 trout,four of them weighed a little over 4 pounds each. Upon this occasion Ihooked and brought to sight, one trout, I think, of 10 pounds weight; but onaccount of the perpendicular height of the bank I could not land him.Concerning wild fowl: for years our lakes, ponds and streams were alivewith pelicans, geese and ducks; and chickens and sage hens were numerous inthe hills; but as the country is being settled, our feathered game, too, cor-respondingly diminishes. Chickens are now mostly confined to the distanthills and canyons. During the last few days we have killed 30 chickensnear our camp. One of our company started a flock and shot 9 times onthe wing, dropping 9 birds, and the 10th shot brought down 2, the balance ofthe charge striking the side of a rock glanced and hit a young man as hewas mounting into the saddle. Seven shot lodged in the man and eleven inthe horse the man was hit in the throat, sholder, back of head, and rightknee. Nothing serious, however, resulted from the accident.Respectfully,Wilford WoodruffP. O. Box B, Salt Lake City Utah. 
 terrible than a storm or wreck for when fire gets the control all hope is lostand persons will plunge into the raging deep to escape its fury. On myreturn to the cabin I found one woman in convulsions with alarm and MrsWoodruff holding her and she did not get over it until the next day.On the 19th under a fair wind we crossedLake Erie entered the mouth of Welland Canal to go round the Falls into Lake Ontario on the Canadian side. The canal was 28 mileslong and had 38 locks.On the 23rd in the Lake Ontario a galearose at midnight and during the next day we had a very roughtime and fire again broke out in the midst of it.Journying on by boat and rail I arrivedat my father's house at Farmington on the 30th. My wife andchildren left me on the road several days before to visit her parentsand family.I had quite an interesting time in visitingmy family and friends in Farmington and neighbouring placesand during my stay there I ordained my uncle Ozem Woodruffunto the office of High Priest.My native place & family I left again on the 5th of October andarrived in Boston two days later. Here I found the eastern churcheswere passing through a critical state and I wrote to President Younggiving him an account thereof. Elder J. J. Adams at this time was holding discussion with O Bachellon at the Malrlbury Chapell. Itwas a money getting scheme.On the 12th I acclaimed in great powerand plainness to the Church in Boston against iniquity in all its formsinforming them Saints that any man from the head to the foot wouldbe brought to justice if he broke the commandments of God and advisedall to be cautious and for none to throw themselves to ruin becauseothers do wrong.I had a convers[at]ion with Bro Whitmoreand he related to me the following dream 
 He had prayed to God to let him see Joseph in a dream and hefell asleep and dreamt that he saw the heavens opened and beheld some ofthe things of eternity. He way a personage rise out of the earth andan Elder informed him that it was Joseph Smith. Joseph did not speakto him but droped some slips of paper on the ground from whencehe arose. Brother Whitmore picked up one of them and read uponit the words--"Emma is not worthy of me." He wishedto read the others but the person with him picked them up and put them in his pocket and did not let him read them.After my meeting that evening Elder Adamsand Brannan prefered a charge against Elder Hardy for slanderand the case was to be tried on the following Tuesday.On the Sunday I met a large congregationSister Vose that day gave me 10 dollars and another sister five tohelp me on my mission and in the afternoon's meeting a collectionwas taken up for the same object making in all about 50 dollarswith the $15 given me at Sister Vose's. At night I attended anotherdiscussion between Adams & Bachellon.I visited Lowel where there I found ElderWilliam Smith; and the Branch at that place was in a sadcondition of disatisfaction and in Boston on that evening the trialwas to come off against Elder John Hardy to try to cut him off forslandering Adams Brannan and William SmithI was at Gilsum [ink changes] ^N. H.^ [ink changes back] on the 21st where Iarrived with two brethren having rode from Peterboro to Elder ChilonMack's son of Solomon Mack. Here I preached in the eveningand spent the night with Solomon Mack aged 72 brother of LucySmith mother of the Prophet Joseph. I spent the evening inconversation about the Smith's family.The next day was the last one set by the Milleritesfor the coming of Christ. I rode to the old home stead of MotherSmith where she was born on the side of a hill and the Brook AshuilekIt was truly a rural place. We rode through Walpole had a good 
 view of Westminster in Vermont called upon several brethren and incompany with Elders Charles A Adams and Alfred Cordon preached inthe evening at the schoolhouse at DrewsvilleNext day I was a[t] Peterborough and thence onthe following to Boston where at the Post Office I found a letter from my wife stating that both her and the children were very sickI directly started on the next day to my wifeand arrived at Scarborough on the same day and found my wife & childrenHere for the next month I was as it were blockaded with sicknessand surrounded with darkness and it seamed as if the Destroyer waswas trying to hedge up my way to hinder me on my mission fornot only my wife and children but a number of her family was afflictednigh unto death.We left our little daughter Phebe Ameliawith my wife's father and mother and on the 21st of NovemberI started with my wife and youngest child Susan Cornelia for NewYork to set sail for EnglandA Peculiar DreamWhile at my father in laws I dreamt a peculiardream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. IndeedI cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thoughtI was called to hold with the Twelve the keys of the kingdom in allthe world and I travelled with them over much of the earthand finally travelled through many countries alone and whenI got through I saw many things which I cannot write andin the end Joseph Smith the Prophet assissted me to come intothe place where he was and pointed out my work and portion[change of ink] ^and^ [change back] of labour. I immediately entered into the dutiesassigned me.I also had on the same night anotherdream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph 
 and was conversing with him about his death. I told him I felt bad aboutit and that had I known he would have been taken away so soon I shouldhave conversed more with him while living and asked him more questionsHe said it was not his fauld I did not. Speaking of my work and dutieshe said I had better get a dozen to help meII stoped at Boston on my way and bet with theChurch and cut off eight from the Church who had joined Sydney Rigdon'sfaction. This left the Boston Church firm.On the Sunday Nov 24th after leaving BostonI was with the Saints in New Bedford with whom I held meetingsthat day during which three were baptizedThe Monday I spent taking a view of thecity which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to besurpassed. It is [ink changes] ^the most^ [ink changes back] a noted city for fitting out of walemen.The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. Thedocks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We wentaboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out whichwould carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels ofoil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels broughtfrom the wale country.I arrived in New York on the29 where I received a letter from my father and mother in lawstating that Samuel Denning had turned him off from themill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to oldage and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the millsand when they were ready to start and the Winter comingon he turned him off without notice.At New York I also received a letterfrom President Young in answer to the one I wrote him fromChicago and several days after its receipt I wrote a longletter to President Young [ink changes] ^him^ [ink changes back] informing him of the recklessness ofWilliam Smith and George J. Adams during that season 
 I was at the time on a visit to Philadelphia spendinga few days with Jedediah M Grant and the Saints there. I returnedto New York on the fourth of December being accompanied 40miles on the way by Elder J. M. GrantThe 5th was my last day on shore whichI spent with my wife's brother Ilus F. Carter packing up my trunksand preparing to leaveWe were on board the splendid newpacket ship John R. Skiddy Capt W[illia]m Skiddy with sailshoisted going out of Sandy Hook about 11 o'clock Dec the 8thwhen the pilot left us and we steared on our course.The company of the brethren and familiesconsisted of myself wife and child Elder Dan Jones and wifeand Elders Milton Holmes and Leanard Hardy onmission to England to build up and sustain the churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in that landWe had a heavy gale on the 11th andwe were driving under head winds and bare poles during theday and in the evening about 9 o'clock the gale increased andit seemed as though the yards would be torn from the mastWe kneeled before the Lord and prayed unitedly that he wouldcause the gale to cease and the wind to change that we mightgo forward and not backward. In a little time the windsuddenly ceased and finally changed to the South-west whichgave us fair windChristmas day on the ocean whichwas the first one I ever spent at sea. We had preserve puddingfor dinner and short cake. We enjoyed ourselves had a lightbreeze and one sail in sightWe entered the Irish Channel on the 28th and here we were beating about under foul windsfor some days. 
 A Dream  on the Night of the 30th Dec 1844I dreamt that I was in council with the martyred Prophetand Patriarch and also with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles inAmerica. I thought we had all to be ordained for some purposeI was called upon by President Young and another person to assistin administering the ordinances. In the midst of the council SidneyRigdon came in and was objected to by Hyrum Smith. Iawoke and again fell asleep and dreamt of being in councilwith the Twelve and others. I made an address to themJohn E. Page arose to address the meeting but was stopedby some female and was followed by Elder Willard SnowI have recorded this dream at the time inmy daily journal yet I did not pay much attention to dreamson shipboard.The close of the year found us beartingabout as we had been for several days in the Irish ChannelSynopsisof the travels and labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1844I travelled in the United States in many of the principalplaces and minor towns and cities in all visiting between 50and a hundred journeyed through some part of Canada and crossedthe Atlantic making in all a distance of ten thousand andfifty milesI held fifty three meetings and attendedten conferences

 The New Year at SeaThe new year found me and my family and companionsDan Jones and wife and Elders Hiram Clark Milton Holmesand Leonard Hardy still on the Packet ship John I P Skiddybeating about in the Irish Channel against head wind as wehad been for five days making but little progressOn the 3rd of Jan. we landed in Liverpool glad to put our feet again on the land after being 27days at sea. On landing we took a cab and drove to 36Chapel Street to find Elder Hedlock but no one being in wespent the night at the Pig & Whistle but the next day I had aninterview with Elders Hedlock and Ward and spent a little timein talking over affairs.The 5th was Sunday and we held meetingsin the Music Hall at which myself and companions EldersDan Jones, Clark Hardy and Holmes addressed the Saints 
 We boarded several days at Mr Powells No 11 Key StreetFrom first to last during a quarter of a century and reaching to 20years later than my present date the Elders boarded with thisWm Powell and afterward his widow.Elder Clark and myself then rented tworooms at Mr. Bagnalls No 38 Highfield St where weremained several weeks and then rented a house in DorIn the meantime we had received an interestingletter from Elder John Taylor and another from President Youngbearing good news of the unity of the Church in America and that Parley P. Pratt had gone to New York to take charge ofaffairs in the eastern churches and publish a paper.We also on the 16th of the mo[n]ths starteda ^company^ ship load of 100 Saints on the Palmyra for New Orleansunder the Presidency of Elder Amos Fielding and Elders Carnes and W. Benson his Counsellors.On Sunday the 19th in the morningI preached in the Music Hall Liverpool and in the afternoonas I entered the meeting Elder Ward spoke to me and wishedme to go with him to Manchester and attend evening meetingas there had been an appointment for an American Elderto preach. Accordingly we took the rail and arrivedjust as the meeting commenced. Elder Ward introducedme and I addressed the meeting 1 hour and twenty minutes.Here I again met Elders Leonard HardyMilton Holmes and Charles Miller with whom I pleasantlyspent the Monday and returned on the following day to LiverpoolIn the 9th No of the Millennial Starvol [gap between words] there is a long address of mine written to the Saints in the British IslandsAbout the middle of February I receivedletters from Elder John Taylor from Navoo and from P P Pratt who was presiding over the eastern churches in 
 America and from Jedediah M. Grant in Philadelphia Accompanyingthese were numbers of the "Neighbours" and "Prophet" published the one in Nauvoo and the other in New York and from the NeighbourI learned of the prospect of more riots and mobs breaking out against NauvooIn company with Elders Leonard Hardy and James Darling Ross I took rail to Manchester on the 15th of Februaryto hold a Special Conference the next day which was SundaySpecial Conferenceheld inManchester Sunday Feb 16, 1845.There were present Wilford Woodruff President of the missionhis Counsellors Elders Hedlock and Ward with five High Priests30 Elders 31 Priests 21 Teachers and 4 DeaconsWe met with the officers before the publicmeeting and laid before them the buisness of the day and thena vast assembly of the Saints gathered in Conference capacityand we laid before them the changes designed for the ManchesterConference and it was proposed that Elder Milton Holmes presideover the Conference and Elder J. D. Ross over the Manchesterbranch both of whom accepted this appointment. Sacramentwas then administered which occupied the time till dark.In the evening we had another [mamoth]meeting. Elder Hedlock first addressed the assembly andthen he and Elder Ward had to leave for Liverpool but could scarcely get out of the crowded Hall. I then arose and addressed the congregation and the Spirit of the Lord was withus and love and union pervaded the congregation.It was a scene to make the heart glad to behold together in a foreign mission so many Saints. 
 writed together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought howmuch I should like to see the Prophet Joseph meet with a Conference of Saints in England but it was not grantedto the British naturi to have the Prophet in their micest [[illegibleto him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands whoheed entered into the New Covenant which God through his missionhad mad unto Israel.This was one of the must interestingConference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilleda prophecy which I gave in the Sterese of the Snol in Brittanedin 1837 that I should attend a  Conference with Elder Milton Holmesin the British IslesOn the 3rd day after our conference Itook the railway cars from Manchester to Bradford where Iarrived at noon and in the afternoon.. Elijah J Sheets arrivedfrom Leeds. She had come neer from America withEkders Stratten and Davis. We were truly glad to meeteach other on a foreign shore and to attend meetings togetherin the evening with the Saints of that place. BrotherSheets was presiding neer the Bradford Conference.The next day in company withElders Sheets and the presidents of the Bradford and KreffeciceConferences I left ^wouldve^ to Jolle in Yorkeshire three miles from Bradfordto pay.[FIGURE]A Visit to the Grave of Lorenzo BarnesWhen we arrived about halfway we had a fair viewof Jolle and the Church yard where for a season was burialthe remains of our beloved brother until the brethren of thehousehold of faith to which he belonged removed the dustythe honoured deed to his natural hand and laid it in theburial place of the Saints. 
 We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before arriving at Idle which is on which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grasswere as green as in May though it was but February which gavethe landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. Wewere walking on the road which our departed brother had walked overmany scores of times to preach the gospel of Jesus and I feltsorrowful and filled with meditation.Arriving at Idle containing a population of seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon Elder Thomas Cordingly and family who had the care of ElderBarnes through his sickness and death. They pointed outto me the house and room where he passed His last hours of his mortal life.After partaking of some refreshments wewalked to the Churchyard and reverantly [gussed] upon the peaceful silentgrave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standingover the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the "horns of Joseph,"one of the members of " Zion's Camps" who travelled more than one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his proseutedand afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakesand whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.While standing upon his grave I offeredup my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the deathof the righteous when called away and that my last end mightbe as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacreddust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection 
 Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder Barnes in companywith my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respectand remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to thefamily who attended him in his last moments I made enquiriesand obtained the following information.The Cause Sickness & Death of Lorenzo BarnesOne day in the latter part of September 1843Elder Barnes walled very felt for about thirteen miles toreach the railway station in time to take the cars. Somepart of the way he ran and got into the [[illegible state of perspirationand may had time step into the barn just as it was startingthe rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during whichtime he became entirely dulled which thro ^gave^ him a severe coldthat setted upon his lungs and brought on quick consumptionfrom which he mever recovered. He attended Conference and preachedseveral times afterwards but was very feeble. The last timehe preached was from the passage — "There remaineth thereforea rest for the people of God". After he was confined to hisbed he was asked if he would have a physician but answered"No." If he died he would die a natural death. If he livedhe should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto theLord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should bethe will of God that he might return to Nauvoo. He wasdeprived of his reason during some portem of the time and hiswhole conversation on which intervals would he about Nauvoohow he should yet there and his friends. The spoke up hisanother frequently. The night before his death he had hisreason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of thetruth of the fretness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints 
 I also learned that Elder Barnes suffered by going withpoor boots and wet feet from place to place. he was slow to make hiswants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to theuntil he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after hewas confined to his bed but then it was too late.I enguired if there were any writings left by him such as Journals etc but could find nothing excepting severalfragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intendedwife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristicof the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments Icopied from his M. S. into my daily Journal.I preached to a good congregation at Idle that eveningand the next day in company with Elders Sheets and Ure and AbrahamLord the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to Bradford.The brethren placarded the town with followingnotice:Conference: _ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints will hold their Conference in the Philadelphia Chapel North WingBradford on Sunday Feb 23rd 1844; to commence at ten o'clock in themorning two in the afternoon and six in the evening; when there willbe present on the occassion two Americans, one of whom belongs tothe quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Also there will be preaching on the fulness of the everlasting gospel as revealed by an angel of the Lord inthese last days on the following ^every^ Monday Tuesday and Wednesdayin the said chapel to commence at eight o'clock each evening. N. B.People of all Persuasions are invited to attendThis Conference was duly held according to notice of which I here give the epitome--------------------------

It fell to my lot once more to address thecongregation during the evening and I took for my [tess] theXIV of Rev to 7 & [[illegible verses. In my deseranse I gave an account ofthe rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of Godby the administration of angels and traced the subject through tothe sealing of his testimony with his blood.I spoke for the space of one hour withthe power of God and the congregation as still as death anda most intense interest prevailed.

 I conformed 4 persons blessed 3 children and laid hands upon twelve persons for the healing of their infirmaties.Two days afterwards I returned to Liverpool stopingon the way several hours at Manchester which I spent with Elder HolmesMarch the 1st was my birthday and I was thirty eight years of age and in Liverpool presiding over the British Mission and with onemy wifeAn Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright ofThe Book of Doctrine and CovenantsOn my birthday I received a letter from a friendcontaining the copy of a letter dated Pittsburgh Jan 30, 1845 written byJohn Greenhow to his father in Kendal stating that he was getting theDoctrine and Covenants sterotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going tobring the plates to England to print the work here and get the copyright securedso that the Church could not print them itThis was indeed a bold move of the apostates toundertake the undertake to print the works of the Church and such abook as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of theChurch and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of Godwhich ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyrightinto my hands. I spent the day in examining the law of England upon the securing of copyright.I spent the forepart of the following day athome and the afternoon with Elders Hedlock and Ward upon whom at thistime I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors and they thenlaid their hands upon me and blessed me.  Afterwards we partookof the sacrament together and then we called upon God our Father tobless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow thedesigns ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause 
 of God.I wrote President Young giving him account of theaffairs of the mission and informed him of the deep laid schemeof those at Pittsburg, America._ John Greenhow Samuel Benettand others to rob the Church of the copyright of the Book ofDoctrine and Covenants. I also wrote to the Secretary atStationers Hall to secure the Copyright of the work myself forthe Church and wrote to brother Cureden to send me a copy of the Doctrine and CovenantsPreston Quarterly Conference was held on Sunday the 9th of March at which myself and Elder Wardattended. Elder John Banks was called to the chair. Duringthe day Elder Leonard Hardy was chosen to preside over theConference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505membersNext day I took a walk through the city andvisited the old Cookpit where Elders Kimball and Hyde hadpreached so much at the first opening of the British mission andwhere also Dr. Willard Richards afterward also preached.We walked up and down the river wheremany hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also [traveled]the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the yallout enthusiastic followers ^[every]^ of the Young Pretender made ^their^ illfatedand mad attempt  to unseat the first George from the Englishthrone and praise it to their bonnie Charle. ^[Washed] it the house of the Stewarts^ Some of the Scotchentered the town as far as the Cookpit but most of them wasslain in the Valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745just one hundred years before this date.We returned to the town and aftr dinnerI took the parting hard of Elders Banks and Hardy and theSaints of Preston and returned to Liverpool 
 Lord Nelson's Monument Liverpool.In company with my wife and Sisters Clark and HaywoodI visited Nelson's Monument the design of which was made by MathewCharles Wyatt of London and was executed in bronze by RichardWestmacott also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble byMessrs [Misters] Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscriptionto build it commenced on the 15th of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the sameyear amounting to £ 9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812The principal figure is Admiral Nelsonresting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a [cannok] his eyestedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourthnaval crown upon his swourd held in his left hand indicating the loss ofhis right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victoryis lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Deathliesin ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged BritishSailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of itsmost illustrious chief and in the back ground is Britanuia leaning onher sphere and shield with lauaral in her hand but she's regardless of themrepresenting the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darlypurchased.Around the upper moulding of the pedestal areinscribed Nelson's ever memorable words _ "England expects every manto do his duty". At the base of the pedestal are four figures inchains as captines emblematical of the four great victories he achieved andthe space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by fourgrand bass reliefs executed in bronze ^also^ representing those gloriousvictories _ namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;Copenhagen 2nd of April 1801; Trafalgar 21st of Oct. 1805. Thefigures are all of the proportion of seven feet. Lord Nelson was 
 born Sep. 29, 1758.The whole range of the buildings called the Exchangecost £ 110,848; Flaging £ 36,000; Town Hall £ 156,000.After visiting this monument we went through severalof the principal ^struts^ and viewed them and then returned home .The day following which was the 13thI took the steamer Commodore for Glasgow in company withElders Hedlock Ward and Banks and arrived at the mouth ofthe river Clyde at 6 o'clock next morning.We passed Gourock, Greennock, Port GlasgowDumbarton at the mouth of the river Leven at which stands the rock so noted in Scotish history and called Dumbarton Castleon which is stationed a regiment of soldiers to protect the riverClyde.We had a fair [revial] of Bell's monumenterected in memory of John Bell who was the first to run a steamerup the river Clyde to Glasgow which is confined to its banksby a stone wall for sixteen miles.The Highlands were covered with snowand we arrived in Glasgow in the midst of a severe snowstorm.In the evening we held a Council with the officers of the Branch and two days afterwards which wasthe 16th we held.The Glasgow Conferenceat the Odd Fellow's Hall GlasgowThe meeting was called to order by DeterPeter McCue was called to the chair and aAfter singing andprayer 15 Branches of the Church was represented containing1065 members 35 Elders 51 Priests 37 Teachers 24 Deacons.Then Gibson was clerk of the Conference.During the day the vast assembly 
 of the Saints was addressed by Elders Hedlock Ward Banks and myself. Ifelt much interested in this my first visit and Conference among the Scotish SaintsNext day I called ^took the^ rail to Coats Bridge and thence wentto Whifflett and held a Council with the officers of that Branch and the followingmorning I took a walk to visit Dunbyrian Fun Works. From thence we visited ^walked^to Ashley and called upon the brethren there and then visitedthe extensive Calder-Banks Mallable Fun WorksI next visited the Ardrie Museumcollected and kept by Mr. Jonnes Myrdock antiquarian. After takingsome refreshments with him he showed us each appartment of the Museumand among the many curiosities I had a [vieal] of coins from about 1000years before Christ down to the present day. Among the rest werecoins bearing the names and profile of Riblios 1100 B.C. Antonius,Vespersion Caesar, Servius, Christian era, Cornodus, Posthurmus,Artaxses, Fragin, Domician, Antonins, Gordian, Auridlsian, Hiradien,Claudius Caesar, and Pins.There was quite a collection of natural Historyand three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I [seen]also a metal pot bearing this inscription: _"One Hundred and twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence". I also sawthree gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travelers from the Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of warand paintings of ancient date.Afterwards we called at a brothers house and Ilaid hands upon six who were sick and blessed twenty persons who pledwith me to let them have a blessing under the hand of an Apostle.  I preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to brother [barruthers] and spent the night.I dreamt a rattle snake bit me on the ancle but Ipulled him off squezed him to death and much poison can out ofhim. The interpretation was that when we arrived at EdinboroughI should be opposed by for appointingJohn Banks to preside over that Branch and Conference after 
 Returning to Glasgow and joining Elders Hedlock andWard we took the rail to Castle Carery and thence by coach to Sterlingand as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fineview of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroicWallace & the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free Scotland fromthe English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace inone of his most famous acts.Arriving at Sterling we called uponElder Daniel Sutherland in John Street and took supper andthen called upon John Gillies 76 years of age. He was the thirdman in the founation of the 92 Hounders was in the army for21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his age.I had an interesting conversation with him during the eveningand we spent the night at his houseSterling Castle. Next morning with brothers Hedlock Wardand Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartmentof it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castlewe closely examined the palace of Mary Queen of Scots and the King'sstables and went into them!In going through the old castle we sawthe armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity. We went into into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oakpulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince HenryI brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon thespot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and produced his first sermon. Here I also saw the place inthe old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figureswhich Knox destroyed before commencing his shermon and fiercedenunciation against [posseny] and [visage] worship. He also hada view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 1639 andCemens Hospital and the place where James the VI (6) was crowned.We had a pleasant view of Streling Castle and the surrounding country from its heights. 
 While at Sterling's I said my hands upon the veteran JohnGillies and beheld him and sustained him an Elder and on the third dayfrom our arrival we took at team back for Edenborough where we arrived atseven oclock and after taking some [refrethmments] at [Heenry cHeEll can;] theResiding Elder we went to the meetingThis was the first time I had we been in Edenboroughand the Edenborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state formany aspiring spritis were there and had been manifested for a lengthof time. I prayed You to give us wisdom to set this conferencein order.^Edinborough Castle.^ [FIGURE]Next day we renewed the renowned city of Edenboroughand visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From thecastle we had a splended view of the city of Edenborugh and surroundingcountry for many miles.

 to an attentive congregation.A company of young men who called themselvesthe Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and theyled us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat whichwas the highest peak of wales anywhere in this region and a good partof the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed thatElder Orsen Pratt while he was establishing the Brach in Edinboroughwhich he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of theworld in London, would frequently go to the top of this rock as aplace of retreat and meditation.From this rock we had a full view ofthe whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country whichpresented to us a [shelelinal] prospect. I was quite unwell witha severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rockor Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brestrenas far as fatigue was concerned.When we had sufficiently viewed thecountry around we relumed took dinner and then visited severalof the Saints and in the evening we held a crucial meetingof the officers.The day after we parted with the Saints in Edinborough took the rail to Georgia where we spent 3 hourswith the brethren then continued by rail to [Grenodp] andthence by steamboat for Liverpool.

I communed with the Saintsand delivered in the evening my farewell address.The following week was a very busy onein preparing for our own emigration and the sending off of a smallcompany of the SaintsOn the 16th I went on board of the ShipLiverpool with my family and about 40 others of the Saints. EldersHedlock Fielding McChacie and myself ^I^ ^and^ went out with the ship tenmiles and I then parted with my family and the company of Saintson board and returned with the above ^several^ brethren in a small boat toLiverpool for I could not go for some days but had to leave mywife and children to cross the Atlantic without me and tarrymyself for some days to settle my business and the affairs of themission. As the 21st was the last day of my timeon shore I was determined to make some settlement of my affairsbefore going on board of the ship and this I had found hard toaccomplish. Elders Ward and Hedlock had so much business oftheir own to do that they had done but little to help me in thesettlement of mine and what they should have done had beenput off by them to the last minute. This made it very hard for me. I had to [illegible] along alone and none to help and ElderWard especially had manifested great indifference and neglect towardsme. However I struggled through it by the help of God and also overthrew a design to partly rob me of the little means I hadThis design I had every reason to believe was concockted by MrJames the Printer and a professed friend standing near me in office and interest.But I succeeded this this day in effecting a finalsettlement and the statement showed that I left the printing department of the Church with property in excess of debts 
 574 pounds 16 shillings and one penny.After regulating the accounts and writingMy Valedictory For the Starall in the midst of a whirl of business I bade farewell to EldersHedlock Ward and Wilson and others around ^and^ with Elder JosephA. Stratton I went on board the packet ship Ashburtonof the Swallowtail line bound for New York with itspassengers and crewWe hoisted anchor and was towed outinto the channel by a steamtug on the morning of the 23 of January. The tug left us about 15 miles outand we set sail and went on our courseMy wife and children with a companyof the Saints were crossing the Atlantic for New Orleans onthe Ship Liverpool and I now commencing my voyageaccross to New York. It was designed that my wifewith the two children with her should go direct towards Nauvooand I by the way of New York to fetch my daughter Phebefrom my wife's sister ^Sarah [Gross]^ in Sc^arborough^ and alsoto take with me to Nauvoo my Father and StepmotherMan OverboardAbout a week after we set sail during a roughish ^[illegible]^ day the second mate steped forward to the bowof the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something onthe [bowsprit] who refused upon the [plea] that it wasdangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate repliedthat he would not ask a man to do a thing he was notwilling to do himself and forthwith attempted the taskAt the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly 
 TEMPLE MANIFESTATIONS.ST. GEORGE AND MANTI TEMPLES.On the 1st of January, 1877, President Brigahm Young, the Apos-tles Wilford Woodruff, Erastus Snowand Brigham Young, Jr., with twothousand or more Saints, assembledwithin the St. George Temple, forthe purpose of dedicating certainportions of it unto God, that wemight be prepared to commencegiving endowments, sealings, andother blessings unto the Saints. At12:30 o&apos;clock, Apostle, now Pres-ident Wilford Woodruff, stood onthe upper steps of the font andcalled attention of the people,and said: "We are this day blessedwith the privilege that but few sincethe days of Adam, have ever en-joyed. But few of the sons of Adamhave ever hadthe privilege of enter-ing into a Temple built by the com-mandment of God, in which toadminister ordinances both for theliving and the dead. We have nowassembled to dedicate portions ofthis Temple unto God; and I havea request to make of all the Saintswho are present, and I suppose allwho are, profess to be Saints, for 
 none others should be here. I realize that this assembly cannot bowthe knee in their crowded condition,but you can bow your heads andyour hearts, before God, and this Iwant you to do this day. And thewords of those who offer up prayers.in the dedication of this Temple, Iwant repeated, in secret, by thisassembly before the Lord, that our prayers may ascend unto the ears ofthe Lord of Saboath, that they maybe answered upon our heads. TheSaints do not prize, as they should,the blessings they enjoy.""The Spirit of God like a fire is burning," was sung.Apostle Erastus Snow announcedthat Elder Wilford Woodruff wouldoffer the dedicatory prayer. Presi-dent Woodruff kneeling on theupper steps of the font, offered theprayer of dedication.We did bow our heads and hearts,—our whild being was mellowed bythe Holy Spirit, and the occasionthat brought us together. A fewwords of that prayer will be in placehere:"Oh God, our Heavenly Father,Father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Thou who hast created theheavens, the earth, the seas andfountains of living waters, and all things that dwell therein. Accept ofthe gratitude of our hearts and thethanksgiving of Thy people, thatThou hast preserved our lives, toagain enter into another Temple,which has been built by Thy Saintsin these valleys of the mountains, inwhich to organize the Holy Priest-hood and to administer the ordi-nances of the Gospel of the Son ofGod, both for the living and thedead. Oh, our God, we Thy sonsand daughters have assembled to-gether, in the name of Thy SonJesus Christ, within the walls of thisTemple, this day for the purpose ofdedicating and consecrating a portionof this House unto the Lord our God; that it may be holy and accept-able in Thy sight. May the prayersof Thy people ascend unto Thineears, O Lord, and be heard andanswered upon their heads." 
 Mountain Standard Time.To the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops of the Different Wards.Dear Brethren—It has been con-templated for some time to facilitatetravel and regulate time in the United States.Owing to the extent of the country and the great change of time, as be-tween its extreme east and extreme west, the distance between whichpoints being nearly 4,000 miles; and as there is to each thousand miles a change of an hour approximately in the meridian, it necessarily makes achange of four hours from east to west. The rapid transit of passen-gers in trains from one place to an-other makes it very inconvenient forpassengers going either east or west, and the changes are so rapid that it renders their time pieces compara-tively useless. The railroads and tel-egraph lines especially have found itnecessary to adopt a time or times oftheir own to suit their own conveni-ences, and to comply as far as practi-cable with the local meridian time ofthe several districts of countrythrough which they pass. In some cities it made it extremely difficult both for the passengers and also for the railroads, as well as for the inhab-itants of the city, who desired to trav-el as, frequently there would be fromtwo to six different times in the samecity adopted by the railroads passingthrough in different directions; and as there is so great an amount oftravel, it became very annoying, notonly to travelers but to parties resid-ing in those cities who were more or less controlled by those circumstan-ces.Numerous plans have been pro-posed and theories introduced to cor-rect this evil, principally, at first, in the interest of railroads and telegraphlines, all of which proposals, untilquite recently, have been rejected astending to confusion. But at lengtha plan was proposed to be introducedto regulate the time of the whole of the territory to the United States, and to have all the cities and towns em-braced in the several States and Ter-ritories conform to a general regula-tion on the subject, so that difficul-ties which were very perplexing andannoying might be avoided, both inregard to railroad travel and also to the inhabitants of cities. The plan proposed is to make four dif-ferent divisions of time, namedthe Eastern, Central, Mountain, andPacific divisions, extending from the extreme east to the extreme west, varying in some slight degree fromdirect lines north and south to meetcircumstances and to avoid confusion; leaving it, of course, as an open ques-tion to the local authorities of the States, Territories, municipalities, anddistricts to adjust these matters agree-ably to their own feelings, and sub-ject more or less, to their action. This state of things reduces the dif-ficulty to a minimum of variationwhich was thought at one time impos-sible to accomplish, and the changefrom one division to another is al-ways exactly of one hour, withoutany perplexing odd minutes or sec-onds.The difference between the presentplan, and the state of things that be-fore existed is that whereas before,there were more than fifty variations of time in the United States, the pres-ent plan will reduce it to four, and ifgenerally adopted it will preventmuch confusion that has heretoforeexisted on this subject.It would seem from accounts thatthe cities of Washington, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, Omaha, Denver, and otherprominent cities east have adoptedthe regulations, in accordance with what is now called the "Standard time" in contradistinction to local time, and that the 75th, 90th, 105th, and 120th meridian west of Green-wich have been selected as initial points from which to calculate thetime. Each of these points are 15 de-grees (or approximately 1,000 miles) apart; and dividing this 1,000 intotwo, one slower and the other faster,no greater change than 30 or 35 min-utes can occur in the most extreme points, while in many places therewill be very slight variations fromtheir local times or meridians.If this had been simply a railroador telegraphic change for the accom-plishment of their business transac-tions, it need not have effected the local time of any of the cities or towns of the United States or Terri-tories. But as it has been found thatit would be beneficial to the general interests of the whole nation, it be-comes necessary for us to calmly andintelligently investigate the subject, and if found practicable, to complytherewith throughout our Territory, in our various cities, towns, and vil-lages, that we may be in harmony with the States and Territories throughout the country.With us the proposed change wouldbe twenty-eight minutes faster inSalt Lake City than our meridian time, and it would necessitate a simi-lar change to be made throughout our whole Territory, and as our settle-ments extend several hundred miles nearly north and south, it would make very little difference in the longitudinal or mean time of any of them.About the year 1860, some officers in the service of the United StatesGeological Survey, I believe, camehere and were desirous of having aninitial point for astronomical, electri-cal, geodetical and other scientific purposes, which was decided to be inthe Temple Block, and PresidentYoung, in accordance with their wish-es, caused a large square block of stoneto be provided, whereon to place theirinstruments, and whence a base linewas laid to regulate the United States and other surveys. We have sincethen had instruments in the Presi-dent's Office for the computation oftime, and a gentleman appointed who was competent to take observations and adjust our time on strictly scien-tific principles. From these obser-vations our city time has been regu-lated from that period to the present,and the correct time has been tele-graphed twice a week to the various telegraphic stations in our Territory;and if thought proper to change to what is called Standard time it willsimply make the difference of addingtwenty-eight minutes to our meridiantime and thus place us in harmony with the nation in regard to this pro-posed change, and that time once be-ing adjusted here can be telegraphedas heretofore to the whole of the Ter-ritory, and thus and same uniformity prevail as has hitherto existed, and all confusion be avoided, so that everypart of the Territory will be governed by the same time, and no confusionor trouble exist; besides it will placeus in harmony with the United Statesin this contemplated improvement.Salt Lake City and Ogden have al-ready, through their Municipal Coun-cil, adopted the Mountain Standardtime, and we recommend that thepeople of the Territory generally adopt this time, and suggest that thecounty, city, and town officialsthroughout the Territory meet in their several capacities at an early day and pass measures to adopt what iscalled the "Mountain Standard" time,and then we can adjust our time asformerly by the Salt Lake meridian,adding the difference between that and the Standard time, and having this time, as heretofore, telegraphed twice a week to the various telegraph offices throughout the Territory, which will avoid confusion and placeus in harmony as to time with allparts of our Territory and also with what is now termed the Standard Time of the United States.Your brethren in the Gospel,JOHN TAYLOR,GEO Q. CANNON,JOS. F. SMITH, First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of the Apos-tles.SALT LAKE CITY, May 12, 1884. 
 AN EPISTLE.Apostle Woodruff's Cheering Coun-sels to the Saints.To the Saints Scattered Abroad; Greet-ing:DEAR BRETHREN: I feel desirous toexpress myself upon the present con-dition of Zion and its inhabitants.The history which we are making asLatter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil-ment of the revelations of God, asgiven through the mouths of Prophetsand inspired men to the inhabitantsof the earth in every dispensationwhen God has had an acknowledgedpeople on the earth. The God ofheaven, who created this earth andplaced His children upon it, gaveunto them a law whereby they mightbe exalted and saved in a kingdom of glory. For there is a law given untoall kingdoms, and all things aregoverned by law throughout thewhole universe. Whatever law any-one keeps he is preserved by thatlaw, and he receives whatever re-ward that law guarantees unto him.It is the will of God that all His chil-dren should obey the highest law,that they may receive the highestglory that is ordained for all immor-tal beings. But God has given allHis children an agency, to choosewhat law they will keep.These two principles do exist—good and evil; God and the Devil.Whatever leads to good and to dogood is of God. Whatever leads toevil and to do evil is of the Devil.God has labored from the creation ofman to lead him to keep the celestial law, that he may inherit a celestial glory and partake of eternal life, thegreatest of all the gifts of God to man:while the Devil, with all the fallenangels, has labored from the creationto lead man astray, to lead him downto the perdition of ungodly men, thathe may have dominion over him.These two principles have governedand controlled the acts of all the chil-dren of men, and laid the foundationfor all the history of the whole worldfor the last six thousand years, orfrom the creation of man. Thispower of the Devil, and of all the fallen angels, who are represented tohave been one-third part of all thehosts of heaven, who were cast downfrom heaven to earth, has been atwar against God and His Christ, andagainst every Prophet and Apostle and inspired man whom God hasraised up, from the creation of theworld to the present day. The firstman, Adam, under the influence ofthe Devil, transgressed a law bywhich death came into the world. [##Genesis 3:1-6##]God the Eternal Father gave His onlybegotten Son, as a great sacrifice, toshed His blood to redeem man fromdeath. For as in Adam all die, evenso in Christ shall all be made alive. [##1 Corinthians 15:22##]The God of heaven, whom we wor-ship, is represented as the Father,the Son and the Holy Ghost. TheFather and Son have tabernacles, andthey created man after their ownimage. But the Holy Ghost is aspirit and a witness and a testimonyof the Father and the Son. ThisHoly Ghost and witness are promisedunto all men who will obey the lawof the Gospel, which God has re-vealed to the human family. ThisHoly Ghost rested upon Adam whenhe blessed his posterity in Adam-ondi-Ahman, three years previous tohis death.The Lord gave unto Adam andmany of his sons the Holy Priest-hood, whereby they could administerin the ordinances of the Gospel oflife and salvation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] The Lord hasraised up men in every dispensation,when He has had a people on earthunto whom He has given the Priest-hood, and all people have been blessed when they have hearkened tothe voice of the Lord. On the otherhand, when the inhabitants of theearth have become wicked, and havetransgressed the law of God, theyhave been chastised, and when theyhave become ripened in iniquity theyhave been cut off from the earth, asin the case of Noah and Lot, and "asit was in the days of Noah, so shall itbe also in the days of the Son ofMan." [##Matthew 24:37##] The righteous were savedwhile the wicked were destroyed.The whole history of the dealingsof the Lord with man has shown thebenefits and blessings of obeying theLord and keeping His commandments. The history of the dealingsof the Lord with ancient Israel showsthat He blessed the righteous andcursed the wicked and brought Hisjudgments upon them. WheneverIsrael hearkened to the teachings ofMoses and the prophets, they pros-pered, and their enemies were a preyunto them. But when they depart-ed from the Lord and set up altars toBaal, and committed sin, the Lordforsook them, as in the case of Judahand Jerusalem, in the days of Zede-kiah the King. [##Jeremiah 32:28-36##] He forsook the Lord,and led the people astray. Theywere full of blood and murder andwhoredom and all manner of abomi-nations, and the Lord warned themthrough His Prophets, Isaiah, Jere-miah and Ezekiel. These Prophetstold the king and the people whatjudgements would come upon them,and the Lord said by Ezekiel untothe king and the people, "What Ihave spoken shall be done." [##Ezekiel 12:28##] Nowall that these Prophets said came topass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un-fulfilled. The Jews put to death theSavior and the Apostles and rejectedthe Lord and the Gospel; and all thatMoses, Jesus, the Apostles and theProphets spoke concerning Israel,Judah and Jerusalem came to pass tothe very letter.All the Prophets and Apostles whohave written since man was placedupon the earth have seen our day,and have prophesied of the eventswhich were to take place on the earthin the last dispensation and fullnessof times. They have seen the Churchof God, the Zion of God, and the Kingdom of God established on theearth, and the gathering of the peo-ple from all nations to build them up,and the judgments of God whichwere to rest, in the last days, uponall nations who should fight againstMount Zion and the people of God.Now, I wish to ask the Latter-daySaints if they can for a moment thinkthat the Lord will fail in these daysin fulfilling His promises any morethan He has in other dispensations?No; He will not.In fulfillment of his sayings throughthe mouths of those ancient Apostlesand Prophets, the Lord has set Hishand once more, for the last time, toprune His vineyard and to establishHis Church and Kingdom upon theearth, to be thrown down no moreforever. He has raised up His Pro-phets and Apostles and revealed untothem the fulness of the everlastingGospel, and given unto them theeverlasting priesthoods of Aaron andof Melchisedek. Joseph Smith wasraised up by the power of God, andthe administration of angels, and hebrought forth the Book of Mormon,the record and stick of Joseph in thehands of Ephraim, as spoken of bythe Prophet Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 37:16-19|37th chap-ter##. This Prophet of God, JosephSmith, had power to organize theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints, according to the ancient or-der of the Church of Christ, withApostles and Prophets, Evangelists,Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. Andthe Church has been led continuallyby living oracles and the revelationsof God from Heaven until the presentday. It has now stood fifty-six yearssince its organization, and its historyis before the heavens and the earth.The Prophets and Apostles and manyElders have gone forth and preachedthe Gospel of Jesus Christ to manynations, and tens of thousands of theinhabitants of the earth have em-braced the Gospel, been baptized forthe remission of their sins, have re-ceived the Holy Ghost by the layingon of hands, and have been gatheredhome to Zion from many nations, infulfillment of the ancient Prophets,who spoke as they were moved uponby the Holy Ghost. Earth and hellhave been combined to stop the littlestone from rolling, and from becom-ing a mountain and filling the wholeearth, as Daniel said it should in the last days. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Joseph Smith, his brotherHyrum, with several of the Apostlesand Elders and many Saints, havealready sealed their testimony withthir blood, and to-day prisons arecrowded with the Elders of Israel forkeeping the commandments of God,and many others have been driveninto exile for the same cause.Many of the inhabitants of the landare stirred up and are desirous to de-stroy the Church and Kingdom ofGod from off the earth. But theyknow not the thoughts of the Lord,neither understand they His ways.The Gentile or Christian world to-daycan no more commit sins, and beguilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy,whoredoms, or murder, or commitany abominations, and escape thewrath of God, then could Sodom andGomorrah, or the antediluvian world,or ancient Israel. The word of theLord has been proclaimed against theGentiles and all the inhabitants of the earth in the last days who com-mit sin, and it will as assuredly befulfilled as in ancient days. The Lordhas a controversy with this genera-tion, and He will judge the inhabi-tants according to the deeds done inthe body, and none can stay His hand.I want to say to the Saints of Godwho dwell in the flesh to-day, thatthe 56 years which have passed awaysince the organization of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,have taken into the spirit world allour Prophets, Apostles, Elders andSaints who have finished their testi-mony in the flesh. Their voice ishushed in death and their testimonyis closed. They are mingling withthe spirits of the righteous and wait-ing for the great day of the comingof the Son of Man, when Jesus Christwill come in the clouds of heaven toreward every man according to thedeeds done in the body. But thoughthey have passed away, is the workof God finished on the earth? Verilyno. Has the warning voice ceasedto be heard by the inhabitants of theearth? It has not. All of us whoremain in the flesh are under as muchobligation to lift the warning voiceand reap while the day lasts aswere those who have passed away.The Lord said to Ezekiel, "I havemade thee a watchman unto theHouse of Israel." "When I say untothe wicked, Thou shalt surely die;and thou givest him not warning, norspeakest to warn the wicked from hiswicked way, to save his life; the samewicked man shall die in his iniquity;but his blood will I require at thinehand. Yet if thou warn the wicked,and he turn not from his wickedness,nor from his wicked way, he shalldie in his iniquity; but thou hast de-livered thy soul." [##Ezekiel 3:17-19##] This is preciselyour condition to-day. As Apostles,Seventies, High Priests, and Elders,we and all men who bear any portionof the Holy Priesthood, are watch-men upon the walls of Zion and mes-sengers to all the inhabitants of the earth, and all of us will be held re-sponsible if we do not improve our timeand lift the warning voice, as far aswe have opportunity, and warn thisgeneration of the judgments of Godwhich await them.I know the judgments of God arevery nigh unto the door of this na-tion and this generation, and theywill overtake the world before it isprepared for that time. Even thecoming of the Son of Man is nigh,and he will come as a thief in thenight. [##2 Peter 3:10##] Who is prepared to abidethe day of His coming? It is ourduty to labor and reap. Then everyman should be diligent in that spherein which he is called to act, that hisgarments may be clean from theblood of all men.I do not believe there was ever ageneration of men who inhabited theearth who were more wicked, or whowere practising greater abominations,or who were sinning against greaterlight and knowledge, or who had agreater flood of judgments proclaimedagainst them by the word of the Lord,than the generation in which we live.Therefore, as Saints of the living God,who bear the Holy Priesthood, weshall be under condemnation if we donot lift up the warning voice againstthe evils and abominations which ex-ist, so far as we have opportunity.How many woes the Prophets andApostles have proclaimed againstthose who fight against Zion. "Woeunto all those who discomfort mypeople, and drive and murder them,and testify against them, saith theLord of hosts. A generation of vipersshall not escape the damnation ofhell. Behold, mine eyes see andknow all their works, and I have inreserve a swift judgment, in the sea-son thereof, for them all. For thereis a time appointed for every man,according at his work shall be." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:23-25##]I will say to the Apostles, our re-sponsibility is very great. TheProphets who organized the Churchand laid the foundation of this lastdispensation, with a whole quorumof Apostles, have finished their testi-mony had gone into the spirit world.We have been called to take theirplaces. What manner of men oughtwe to be? The whole earth is ripen-ing in iniquity, and the Zion of Godshould be prepared for the coming ofthe bridegroom. We should humbleourselves before the Lord and be in aposition to be filled with the spirit ofour calling with the Holy Ghost, andwith the revelations of Jesus Christ,that we may know the mind and willof God concerning us, and be pre-pared to magnify our calling andbring to pass righteousness, and bevaliant in the testimony of JesusChrist to the end of our pilgrimage,here in the flesh. The Prophets,Apostles, and all the heavenly hostsare watching over us. There neverwas a time when the work of God re-quired a more faithful testimony andlabor from the Apostles and Eldersthan to-day.I would say to the Saints, whostand connected with the quorum ofthe Twelve Apostles, as messengersto the nations of the earth, it hasfal,en to your lot to go forth andassist to prune the vineyard oncemore, and for the last time, beforethe coming of the Son of Man. TheLord said, fifty seven years ago, thatthe field was white for the harvest,and He had set His hand to prunethe vineyard once more, and for thelast time. The Elders were com-manded at that day to thrust in theirsickle and reap while it was calledto-day, for soon night would come,when no man could reap. [##Doctrine and Covenants 11:3##] Brethren,it is much nearer night now than itwas fifty-seven years ago. TheSavior said at that day, that theangels were crying day and night forthe privilege to go forth and reapdown the earth. He informed themthey must wait a little season untilthe harvest was fully ripe. The na-tions must be warned, Zion must beestablished, and the wheat, or theSaints, be gathered into the garner,then the angels might go forth andreap the tares, gather them in bun-bles and prepare them for the burn-ing. [##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5-7##]Since that day many thousands of the Saints have been gathered to Zion from the nations of the earth.But you are called upon at this lateday to still go forth and warn theGentiles with the proclamation ofthe Gospel. Therefore, brethren,you who are called to go into thevineyard, whether Apostles, HighPriests, Seventies, or Elders, do notbe weary in well doing. Remember,you are messengers of salvation.Keep yourselves pure and spotlessbefore God and all men. Seek tobring to pass righteousness, and savethe souls of men. Labor faithfullythat your garments may be cleanfrom the blood of all men, and thatthe nations may be left without ex-cuse in the day of God's judgmentsupon the wicked, which is nigh athand, and those judgments will bepoured out without measure.All the messengers in the vineyardshould be righteous and holy men,and call upon the Lord in mightyprayer, in order to prevail. It is theprivilege of every Elder in Israel,who is laboring in the vineyard, ifhe will live up to his privileges, tohave dreams, visions, and revelations,and the Holy Ghost as a constantcompanion, that he may be able thor-oughly to gather out the blood ofIsrael and the meek of the earth andbring them into the fold of Christ.It is true that the Elders who arecalled to bear record of the Gospel ofChrist to the nations of the earth aremany times called to pass throughpersecutions for the Gospel's sake,and in some instances to lay downtheir lives, as did the ancient Saints,and quite a number in our day, for Christ's sake. But there seems to bea special crown of glory laid up forevery man who is martyed forChrist's sake and the Gospel's. Nomatter in what age of the world helays down his life for Christ's, he willfind it again, and eternal life in theworld to come. Therefore, brethren,let us be diligent in our labors in this last hour in the vineyard. The Lordsaid to Oliver Cowdery, if he laboredall the days of his life and saved butone soul, how great would be his joyin the Kingdom of Heaven with thatone soul. [##Doctrine and Covenants 18:15-16##] We have everything to en-courage us in our labors in the vine-yard of the Lord.While this labor is going on amongthe nations of the earth, there is agreat labor and responsibility restingupon the whole ministry who dwellin Zion. There is labor sufficient forevery man who bears any portion ofthe Holy Priesthood in the variouscapacities in which the brethren arecalled to act. The High Priests, whose calling is to preside, are calledupon to officiate in Zion as High Councilors, Presidents of Stakes andCounselors, Bishops and Counselors,Superintendents of Sabbath Schoolsand mutual improvement associa-tions. In every capacity in whichthey are called to act, they have animmense field  in which to improvetheir talents and magnify their call-ings. Here is where the High Priestsare mainly called to preside, officiateand labor.There never was a time when theHoly Priesthood, in all its variousbranches, offices and labors, had agreater work to perform than in ourday. The searching out of iniquity,the purifying, sanctifying and cleans-ing of the people, the uniting of theSaints and the general perfecting ofZion resting upon the brethren andthe Holy Priesthood who dwell inZion.The whole Church, both priest andpeople, should give diligent heed tothe late Epistle of the First Presiden-cy, which has been published to the world. The counsel they have givenupon the various items they have re-ferred to should be strictly carriedout. The breaking of the Sabbathday and pleasure excursions uponthat day should not be indulged inby the Latter-day Saints. The Pres-idents of Stakes and their counselors,the Bishops and their counselors,whose immediate duty it is to watchover the stakes and wards, have agreat responsibility and duty to per-form. Iniquity must be sought out.Zion cannot prosper when sin and in-quity are permitted to dwell in hermidst.One of the most important and re-sponsible fields of labor in Zion isthat committed to the care of thosewho preside over and teach in theprimaries, Sabbath schools, and im-provement associations, and thosewho are teaching private day schoolsamong the Latter-day Saints. Whocan comprehend the result of the la-bor performed by the Elders of Israelin these branches? No man, unlessfilled with the revelations of Heavenand the inspiration of Almighty God.We send out hundreds of Elders, whogo to the nations of the earth topreach the Gospel of Christ. Afterspending two or three years as mis-sionaries, if they have converted adozen souls and brought them intothe Church, they think they havedone a good work, which they cer-tainly have. But here, the Elderswho are presiding over the teachingin these institutions in Zion, filledwith the children of the Saints, havean army of immortal souls beforethem to guide and teach, and to di-rect their minds, that they maybe qualified to step forth and takehold of the Church and kingdom of God and build it up and bear it offtriumphantly, after their fathers andelders are laid in the tomb. O what amission is given to the sons of Eph-raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter-day Saints! To warn the whole worldof the judgments which are to come,preach the Gospel to all people, gath-er the saints from all nations, buildup Zion, and prepare for the comingof the Son of Man, standing in holyplaces, while judgments waste the wicked.There is one admonition of ourSavior that all the Saints of Godshould observe, but which, I fear, wedo not as we should, and that is, topray always and faint not. I fear, asa people, we do not pray enough, infaith. We should call upon the Lordin mighty prayer, and make all ourwants known unto Him. For if Hedoes not protect and deliver us andsave us, no other power will. There-fore our trust is entirely in Him.Therefore our prayers should ascend into the ears of our heavenly Fatherday and night.I want to say a few words to ourbrethren who are in prison, or underbonds, or driven into exile for ourreligion, or for keeping the command-ments of God. You should not thinkthat any strange thing has happenedunto you. Persecution is a legacythat has been handed down fromfather Adam to our day. It was saidof old that all men who lived godlyin Christ Jesus should suffer perse-cution. If we meet with no persecu-tion in our day, we shall hardly feelat home when we go into the spirit world and meet with the ancient prophets and with Christ and theApostles, who passed through muchpersecution and tribulation. Manyof them were crucified or otherwiseput to death. They sealed their tes-timony with their own blood, as wasthe case with Joseph and Hyrum andseveral of the Apostles, Elders, andSaints in our day.As Elders of Israel, while we arepassing through these afflictions, letus not cherish revenge or hatred inour hearts towards our persecutors."Vengeance is mine; I will repay,saith the Lord." [##Romans 12:19##] Jesus Christ, theSon of God, when nailed to the cross,and while in the agony of death,cried, "Father, forgive them; for theyknow not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Why didHe say this to His Father in Heaven?Because the Son of God knew fullwell what would be the result of His death upen the heads of His mur-derers. He knew what awaited thewhole Jewish nation, when that peo-ple said, "Let His blood be on usand on our children." [##Matthew 27:25##] He fully com-prehended the great suffering thatawaited the Jews and their posterityfor the next eighteen hundred years.He knew that all that Moses and theProphets, as well as what He hadspoken Himself, against the Jewishnation, would come to pass; for Godhad spoken it through them, andhis words never fail.No infidel on earth can deny thefact that Jerusalem was overthrown,the foundation of the Temple dug upand not one stone left upon another.The Jews fell by famine, by pestilenceand by the sword, until twelve hun-dred thousand dead bodies were car-ried through the gates outside of thewalls of Jerusalem during the dis-tress of the siege under Titus, and aremnant was taken captive and scat-tered throughout the world amongthe Gentile nations, and the Jewshave been a hiss and a byword, andhave been trampled under the feetof the Gentiles until the present day,and the end is not yet, the yoke isnot yet broken from off their necks.All this has come to pass in fulfil-ment of the Word of God to theJewish nation. So I say to all mybrethren who are in exile, or inprison, for the Gospel's sake, or forkeeping the commandments of God,do not harbor any vengeance or ha-tred against this nation, or againstthose who have aided or abetted inyour sufferings, but rather go beforethe Lord and pray that He will sof-ten the hearts of the rulers of the na-tion, that they will give unto theLatter day Saints the same rights andprivileges in the worshiping of Godaccording to the dictates of their ownconsciences as are guaranteed by theConstitution of our Government,which was given by the inspirationof the God of heaven for a wise pur-pose in Himself.If I am asked why I make this re-quest of my brethren, I answer, forthe same reason that Jesus said,"Father, forgive them; for the knownot what they do." For as the Godof heaven fulfilled all His wordswhich He spoke concerning Judeaand Jerusalem, so will He fulfill allthat He has spoken concerning theGentiles and all the nations of theearth in the last days.I will here say, as truly as the Godof heaven lives, and has establishedHis throne on high, just so truly willHe bring to pass the fulfilment ofHis words. He will pour out thatflood of judgments upon our nationand upon all the nations of the earth,which has been proclaimed by everyinspired man since the world began.The seals will be opened, the plaguespoured out, and Great Babylon willfall. This generation has been warn-ed for the last fifty years by inspiredand righteous men, and after theirtestimony will come the testimony ofthundering, of lightning, of floods,of earthquakes, and of pestilence,and famine, and war, and the flamesof devouring fire, for by fire and bysword will the Lord plead with allflesh and the slain of the Lord willbe many. For the Lord has said,"My sword is bathed in heaven, andit shall fall upon Idumea, or theworld: and who is able to stand?" [##Isaiah 34:5##]No power on earth can stay thehand of God in this work. The Godof heaven will teach this nation andall other nations on earth, that He isstronger than man. He pays no re-gard to nations or numbers, in thefulfillment of his purposes, for Heholds in His hand the destiny of allmen and nations, and no power be-neath the heavens can hinder Hiswork. The God of Israel has set hishand to gather His people from allnations and build up His Church andestablish Zion in all that beauty,power, and glory which Isaiah andother Prophets saw, and to build upHis kingdom, which shall fill thewhole earth, and in which Jesus ofNazareth will establish his throneand sit thereon, and reign over theearth for one thousand years, as theProphet Daniel and other Prophetshave declared. And it will come topass in spite of earth and hell and allthe unbelief of the whole ChristianGentile world. If our nation or theGentiles do not believe this, let themwait and see, and they will not haveto wait long before they will see thesigns manifest of the beginning ofthese things. So far as the Saints areconcerned, the Spirit of God will bearrecord to their spirits as they readthese testimonies, of their truth.I will close by quoting the testi-mony of Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 24:14|24th chapter14th verse##—"I the Lord have spokenit; it shall come to pass, and I will doit; 1 [I] will not go back, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, andaccording to thy doings, shall theyjudge thee, saith the Lord God."WILFORD WOODRUFF.October, 26, 1886. 
 MANTI TEMPLE.An Address from President Woodruff inRelation Thereto.SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20th, 1887.To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops andthe Saints generally:It is with profound feelings of grati-tude and thanksgiving to our heavenlyFather that we announce to theLatter-day Saints that the Templewhich is being erected at Manti hasbeen so nearly completed as to beready for the upholstering, furniture,carpets etc., which are necessary toput it in a state of complete prepara-tion for the sacred labors to be per-formed therein. This is the thirdbuilding of this character which in the kind providence of God the Latter-daySaints have been permitted to erectand finished in these mountains. The Temple at Salt Lake City is also pro-gressing in a satisfactory manner,which, when finished, will be thefourth Temple that has been construct-ed by the Saints under the directionof the Almighty since we came tothese valleys.How blessed are the people whohave had these glorious privilegesgranted unto them! Our hearts swellwith irrepressible feelings of thanks-giving and joy to our Father in heaventhat he has permitted His Saints tobuild these houses. They now haveopportunities to act as saviors of theirfellow men, which but few genera-tions of the children of men have everenjoyed. The great work of the res-toration of the dead which will occu-py the time and thought of futuregenerations has now begun, nevermore to end until the earth is sancti-fied and the plan of salvation devisedin the eternal worlds for human re-demption is fully consummated.Our object in addressing you in thiscircular is to present to all the mem-bers of the Church the opportunity ofcontributing, according to their meansand liberality, something towards thefurnishing of the Manti Temple. Here-tofore the contributions for that build-ing have been confined to the Stakeswhich are numbered in what is knownas the "Manti Temple District." Be-fore the Logan Temple was completedan opporutnity was given to the Saints to contribute towards the pur-chasing of its furnishings, furniture,etc. They gladly responded to thecall which was made upon them. Wefeel that they will, on the present oc-casion, appreciate the privilege ofcontributing in like manner towardsthe purchasing of suitable upholstery,carpeting, etc., for the Manti Temple.The funds of the Superintendent areexhausted, and contracts are alreadymade for needed articles, which haveto be met at an early date.Contributions will be taken fromtwenty-five cents upwards, so thatthose who are the most limited inmeans need not be debarred, whilethose who are more wealthy, can havethe satisfaction and pleasure of mak-ing donations according to theirability for the completion of thisnoble edifice. We would like thePresidents and Bishops to give everyone an opportunity of doing some-thing in this direction, and the names of all, with the amounts contributed,should be carefully taken.We would like to see the names ofevery man, woman and child in the Church recorded in the Archives ofthe Temple as having contributedsomething towards its erection andcompletion.These funds with the donors' namescan either be forwarded to the officeof the Presiding Bishop or to the ChiefClerk—Brother James Jack, at thePresident's Office.It is important that these collec-tions should be made and remitted aspromptly as possible, as the need forthis means is pressing.WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of the Apos-tles. 
 TRUE RELIGIONConsists in the Love of God, Faithin His Son, Repentance andForsaking of Sin, Obedi-ence of the Ordinances,and Keeping ofthe Law.As Set Forth Forcibly by PresidentWilford Woodruff,In Fatherly Admonition to the Lat-ter day Saints.EDITOR HERALD: Receiving aletter from you, some time since, wherein you solicit for publication"an array of sentiments from theleading men of the Territory," etcI now at the last moment, afterhaving been so busy, undertake,with leasure, to comply with yourrequest.RELIGIOUS.The majority of the people of this Territory are a religious peopleBy revelation and inspiration fromAlmighty God the Latter daySaints are called upon to perpetuateand establish righteous principles, not only in the Territory, butthroughout the earth. The Dispensation of the Fulness of Timesis ushering in upon the inhabitantsof the earth, and with it are re-ceived the principles of Eternal Life, the greatest gift of God toman. The Latter day Saints whoconstitute the largest proportion ofthe people who inhabit these Rocky Mountain vales have revealed tothem this gift through Jesus, theMediator—the Savior of the world.Therefore, Oh! ye Latter daySaints, Oh! ye House of Israel, andOh! ye inhabitants of the earth, re-member! that when God, the Father, gave His only begotten sonas a ransom for your sins, He gave a Christmas gift that cannot be ex-celled---the gift of eternal life!Through this gift ye can possess theriches of Eternity.Should there not be somethinggiven in return as an acknowledg-ment for this gift? It cannot bebought with money, so far as the riches of this world is concerned itis without price. But the priceof it is, the love of God the Father,faith in His Son Jesus, repentanceand the forsaking of sin, obedienceto the sacred ordinance of baptism, and the laying on of hands for thereception of the Holy Ghost, andthen the keeping of all His holy and revealed laws.This is true religion. These are some of the religious principlesadopted by the Latter-day Saints,and how to obtain the gift of eter-nal life should be the highest am-bition of every man, woman, and child. The earth groans under afalse Christianity. The true Chris-tian principles that were advocatedby the Savior and His Apostles areno longer practised throughoutmodern "Christendom." The earthis deluged with false Gospel, falsereligion, and with different systemsand plans of salvation. The inhab-tants of the earth are being "tossedto and fro by every wind of doc-trine." [##Ephesians 4:14##] False teachers "having aform of godliness but denying thepower thereof" have sprung up inevery land and clime; parties, sects,and organizations under religiousgarbs are extending their multita-rious false theories, enveloping themind of man with a hopeless faith. [##2 Timothy 3:5##] The signs of the times portend thefulfillment of the prophecies thathave been made concerning thegreat wickedness that should beupon the earth in the latter days,when great plagues shall bepoured out upon the world andAngels pour out the vials of the wrath of Almighty God. But pre-vious to this all people are to bewarned by the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, committedthrough the Angel that John theRevelator saw "flying through themidst of Heaven, having the ever-lasting Gospel to preach to every nation, kindred, tongue, and peo-ple, saying with a loud voice, 'FearGod, and give glory to Him, forthe hour of His judgment is come.' " [##Revelation 14:6-7##]That Angel has flown, the Gospelproclamation has been sent forth tothe world for the last half centuryand over, and we may expect thejudgments to follow these declara-tions, for it is decreed "the hour ofHis judgment is come."The Latter-day Saints have gath-ered to these mountain vales, by the revelations of God, to preparea place of refuge, for the gatheringin of Israel, that the honest in heartfrom all nations might have a placeof safety and escape the judgments of the wicked. And while the wick-ed rule and the people mourn, theSaints of the Most High will con-tinue to establish the principles ofrighteousness, the principles of free-dom and true government, until theLord Himself comes to reign as "King of Kings and Lord of Lords."SOCIAL.The social condition of the Lat-ter day Saints is founded upon their unity. "In unity there isstrength." "United we stand,divided we fall," is our true maxim:And as Paul, the Apostle of old,said to the Former-day Saints, sosay I to the Latter-day Saints."Be ye not unequally yoked to-gether with unbelievers; for whatfellowship hath righteousness withunrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?And what concord hath Christ withBelial? or what part hath he thatbelieveth with an infidel?" (##2 Corinthians 6:14-15|2 CorVI., 14, 15, 16##)These questions of Paul's are relevant and very important to thesocial status of the Latter-day Saints,for, as Paul further says: "Whatagreement hath the Temple of Godwith idols? for ye are the Templeof the Living God; as God hathsaid: 'I will dwell in them, andwalk in them; and I will be theirGod, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from among, and be ye separate; saith theLord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you; and will be a Father unto you, and yeshall be my sons and daughters,saith the Lord Almighty.' " (##2 Corinthians 6:16-18|2 Cor.VI; 16, 17, 18)As a people, we cannot affiliatewith the world, nor the things ofthe world, and keep ourselves pureand unspotted from the world. The Savior says "If ye were of theworld, the world would love hisown, but because ye are not of theworld, but I have chosen you outof the world, therefore the worldhateth you." (##John 15:19|S. John, XV, 19.##)The Latter-day Saints are"chosen out of the world" and ga-thered here into the tops of themountains for the purpose of build-ing up the Church of Christ, thatin this Church they might be taught more fully the ways of the Lord and learn to walk in Hispaths, that they may be preparedto establish the Kingdom of Godspoken of by Daniel, the Prophet,that he saw should be set up in thelatter days by the God of Heaven,and which shall never be destroyedor left to other people, but shallstand forever. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]Now, the Latter-day Saints, un-derstanding their calling, cannot afford to mingle, in their associa-tions, with the world; for in the very nature of things the two ele-ments will not unite and still re-main in a healthy and prosperous condition. "Love not the world,neither the things of the world; ifany man loves the world the love of the Father is not in him," sosay the Scriptures; and those whoare not for the Kingdom areagainst it. [##1 John 2:15##] Therefore, as the chosen people of God, we ought to honorour Father who has chosen us, andbe very careful whom we associate with. In all our dealings and as-sociations let them be with theLatter-day Saints. Be watchful ofthe sons and daughters of Zion thatthey do not become "unequallyyoked together with unbelievers." [##2 Corinthians 6:14##]Let the sons of Zion take thedaughters of Zion to wife. Letthe people of God be united in allthings, politically, religiously,socially, commercially, andindustrially. "If ye are notone ye are not mine" says the Sa-vior; and also, He says: "Be ye oneas the Father and I are one." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] [##John 17:21-22##]If the Latter-day Saints willadhere and give heed to these wisesayings, the Lord, in His own duetime,—in the time of the harvest,shall send forth His reapers, theAngels, who shall gather out thetares to be burned; and "The Sonof Man shall send forth His angels,and they shall gather out of HisKingdom all things that offend, andthem which do iniquity; and shallcast them into a furnace of fire;there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteousshine forth as the sun in the King-dom of their Father," (##Matthew 13:41-43|St. Matthew,xiii; 41, 42, 43.##)Wishing your patrons a "MerryChristmas!" and a "Happy NewYear!"I remainYour Brother in the Gospel,W. WOODRUFF.HISTORIAN'S AND RECORDER'S OFFICEOF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH. 
 FROM PRES. WOODRUFF.An Epistle to the Saints Throughout theWorld.Beloved Brethren and Sisters: Once more in the dispensation of Provi-dence we are called to mourn the de-parture from this life of a friend and brother.The Prophet, Seer, Revelator and President of the Church, Elder John Taylor, was called to rest on the evening of July 25th, 1887. In sor-row for our loss, we, your brethren,join with you in mourning his depar-ture. Having fought the good fight,he earned a crown of endless glory,and now mingles with Joseph andHyrum and Brigham.He has gone beyond the vail, butGod is with us still to comfort, inspire and direct us heretofore. Peace be un-to you. As upon two former occasionsin our history, the duty and responsi-bility of presiding over and directingthe affairs of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints in all theworld devolves upon the Twelve Apos-tles. With the blessing of the Lord and the faith and prayers of His peo-ple, we hope to do our duty until we,too, shall be laid to rest.As Saints of the Most High, whileliving, let us give our hearts to God, sanctify ourselves by keeping hiscommandments, have oil in our lamps, our houses in order, and hopefullyand prayerfully look forward to the day of deliverance, the set time for the accomplishment of which is fastapproaching.While mourning for the dead andholding his memory sacred, let us trust in the God of Heaven, remember the living, unite our hearts, and earn-estly strive for the redemption of Zion.Let us not seek occasion for offenseone against another, but forgive eachother's trespasses; that the Holy Ghost may be our constant compan-ion, and the doctrines of the priest-hood distil on our minds like the dewsof heaven."Many are called, few are chosen." The Almighty has revealed in our daythe reasons, but what a mighty boat have wrecked their eternal hopes on these fatal reefs—love of the riches ofthis world, the honors and praises ofmen, and the exercise of unrighteous dominion. 
 Elder W Woodruff quoted from the revelations thatthe Lord is angry with the wicked every day. Manythings are being done here which are pleasing to theLord. The building of the Temples may be an advantagepernniarily; but there are other and far greaterconsiderations. The Lord will not disappoint anyonein regard to his revelations, their unbelief to thecontrary, notwithstanding. As God lives the UnitedStates will follow in the wake of the Jaredites.The labor of the Elders of Israel today is in buildingTemples, administering therein for the living and the dead;when the ordinances are performed for them they are savedso far, the Heavens are watching no we should bediligent. Man, who is destined to live as long asGod lives, says, give me money, you may take theblessing of eternal lives. What a strange inconsistency.No man can be exalted to the godhead but by the lawsof Celestial Marriage. Zion will rise, Babylon fallcould we see beyond the veil we would go to and buildthese temples and be anxious to redeem our dead. 
 PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFFbore testimony to what had beensaid, to-day, and endorsed the ex-cellent principles of the Priesthoodand revelations, advanced by thePresidency in the morning. Weshouls exercise faith in the Lord.As to the schemes of the ungodly weshouldnot be concerned; for this isthe work of God and He will sus-tain us. All the keys and powersof Priesthood were sealed upon theProphet Joseph and he sealed themupon others. These powers will re-main here until the Lord Jesuscomes. Every Saint holds a por-tion of the Priesthood. Let thepeople of God, therefore, rejoice forthe glorious powers of the Priest-hood. We are built on the rockJesus and the machinations of theadversaries cannot prevail againstit. 
 Let all Israel remember that theeternal and everlasting priesthood isbestowed upon us for the purposealone of administering in the ordin-ances of life and salvation, both forthe living and the dead, and no manon earth can use the priesthood for any other purpose than the work of the ministry, the perfecting of the Saints, edifying the body of Christ, establishing the kingdom of heaven,and redeeming Zion. If we attempt to use it for unrighteous purposes,like lightning from heaven our power, sooner or later, falls, and we failto accomplish the design of God.Let us, therefore, beloved brethrenand sisters, beware of the pride of theworld, and, casting vanity far fromus, be true to God, true to each other and end true to the coven-ants that we have made. Purg-ing ourselves from iniquity and theworkers thereof, let us set ourfaces like flint against sin and wicked-ness of every kind. So shall we, while patiently following the Redeemer, eventually gain the victory over flesh, hell and the grave. We will continuein communication with you as circum-stances may require and opportunities be afforded.Praying the Lord God of heavenand earth, who holds all men andthings in the grasp of His power, tocomfort, cheer and bless you, we re-mainYour brethren in the Gospel cove-nant,WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Twelve Apostles.August, 1887. 
 PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFFwas pleased to be present on thisoccasion. What has been done inbuilding this house, shows what canbe done by union. The house islarge enough to hold you all, but itwill probably not always be so.Notwithstanding the laws passed,against us, we know that their laws do not extend to the spirit world toprevent the labors there. The Lordhas set to work to gather His Israeland prepare them to build, HisZion, a place where His Saints can be preserved while the judgementsof the Lord are scourging the world.To look at the efforts of the world,their labors look great to us, but tothe Lord they are but puny noth-ings. God never gave up His ef-forts to please the enemies of Hispeople. We are His people, fulfillingHis prophecy given by Isaiahwherein he sees out travels over theplains, and our building cities and towns in the mountains. There isno power that can overthrow thispeople, God has guided their des-tiny and will ever do so until theSaints have done their labors.There are no fears except withourselves. We must be united; di-vision is dangerous. In all thingswe must be united. God bless usall and remember those who haveaided in building this house. Fieldswill prosper more and homes becomebrighter when we obey God andlive up to the requirements made of us. This earth is made for us, butit is God's with all we possess. Wecan lose nothing by building housesfor ourselves, by paying tithing, andby giving offerings unto the Lord.We are His with all we possess.This is our testimony, after the tes-timonies of the servants of God willfollow destruction and thunders, ac-cording to the decrees of God. MayGod bless us and aid us to appreci-ate the positions and blessings thatwe enjoy. 
 Great Salt Lake CityNov 7, 1860Brother Amasa LymanDear sir,I feel like writing you a few lines, altho' I have nospecial news to communicate. There has been a good deal of sickness inOctober, and many deaths among children, one of brother C. C. Richs children has died since he left. My daughter, Phebe, wife of Lorenzo Snow lost an infant, it only lived two days, and as two of your women were sick, and had young children, Phebe took Caroline's child to nurse, it was very feeblewhen she took it, it is now a very healthy child and growing finely, she has spent a good deal of time of late at your house to assist themYou are probably aware of the course President Young has taken in regard to the Missionaries who are abroad, and those going abroad, that they are forbidden to collect means of the Saints to send home to their families, and also not to bring any thing homethemselves, only the Souls and Bodies of the poor Saints; and to obviatethis, a collection was taken up in this City to send the Missionaries totheir field of labor, and to keep their families. of I think some 12,00000 weresubscribed, and on the strength of this, I went to your family in the Cityand got a list of what articles they said they wanted, and they have beenfurnished since with the articles they called for, except the calking andplastering of their house: I have not yet been able to get that done, buthave the promise of it.We have had some of the loudest preaching of late from Pres.t Young 
 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFFfirst addressed the meeting. He saidwe have been called on, to-day, to mourn the death of one of God's noble men; on the earth, Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter was one. He had, in the early times of this Church, been closely associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and inone sense was, at one time, the Pro-phet's right-hand man. The speaker did not feel to mourn, personally, for the deceased; for he believed hewas happier than any in that con-gregation, and that he is now ming- ling with Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball, George A. Smith, and scores of others, with whom he associated here in the flesh. His record, which is good, is now before God, angels, and men, and the speaker did not feel that it was necessary for him to say much on that subject.President Woodruff then spoke of the blessings and glories that await all those who keep their covenants and remain faithful, in their positions of trust as Bishop Hunter has done. Such the Lord will sustain and bless in the future as He has done in the past. He felt admonished by the departure of Brother Hunter, and he admon-ished all others to be men and wo- men of integrity and fidelity, so that when our demise occurs our death may be like his. He closed by bearing testimony that the de-ceased had always been faithful and true while he lived in the Church upon the earth. He prayed God to bless the family of Brother Hunter, that they may emulate the vitrues of their husband and father, and have the privilege of again meeting and associating with him in the Kingdom of God.

 concerning Jew and Gentile that we have ever heard. He seemsparticularly inspired to take a decided stand concerning ourenemies, and to point out the destiny of the wicked as well as the righteous: much of the power of God rested upon President Youngduring Conference. I would judge from the operation of the Spiritof the Lord, that there is some important event nigh, which willgreatly effect both Zion and Babylon: many of the Gentiles haveattended our meetings of late, including the Government officials,and they have certainly heard ^had^ some large Pills to swallow, and I thinkthe sinners in Zion have troubled some of late.The Presidency, George A Smith and some others have taken amission South, and visited the Branches South as far as San Pete,they have preached in all the settlements and returned this evening,7th, he has been gone 15 days, and preached 20 discourses.Report says that four of the Salt Lake rowdies have gone under at Pike's peak, two were shot and two hung, including the Sprouse boy.John Martin Luce was stabbed last night in a row, it is thought mortalI hope so at least; he stabbed a man by the name of Olphin twice before Olphin stabbed him.An extra session of the Legislature is called for next Mondayto appoint the Judges their field of labor. Cradlebaugh and Henikinare now in Carson valley, I expect Judge Crosby will be sent to help them; Judge Kinney will remain with us.We have had a fine fall till the last of October, when we had a cold snow storm, we had near a foot of snow fall, it was quitecold for several days—many potatoes in the ground, and some sugar 
 November 16, 1888Dear Brother Addy.Brother R. handed me your note thismorning. In reply will say I supposed you understood perfectly well the situation of all papers anddocuments in the Historian's Office how they were disposedof there was no time to list or itemize them or anything inthat office when they were removed. It would have taken threeclerks four days to have listed what was removed from thatoffice, and we expected every hour for the officers to seizeand the work was not done any too soon. Now the facts arethere was 100 pidgeon holes full of papers and they were putby the bushel into larger boxes with other things without anylisting whatever. There are three tons of those boxes and you knowthe house where they were deposited and I have tried to get themremoved before you went away and I have never been able todo it until within a few days. Brother Jacques is now at workto try and find the papers you want, but it is like looking for aneedle in a hay mow, but he will do as fast as he can. If therehad been time to have numbered those boxes and named eachitem it would have been an easy matter to have got at them, butthere was no time given for it. Brother Jacques has just come in, Heis searching the boxes and has found eight of the papers and giventhem to Bro. R. this morning. I do not feel to cast any blame uponany one but ourselves in this matter. You know that I have been

 ON or before January 1st, 1891, there will be issued from the press of the JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE a publication which should be carefully read and studied by all the Saints, both old and young. It is written by Dr. J. E. Talmage and entitledDOMESTIC SCIENCE.The following endorsements of the work speak volumes in its favor:SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 1, 1890.TO ALL CONCERNED:With the growth of our Church school system, and of the Mutual Improve-ment Associations among our people, the need of text-books specially adapted for use under those organizations becomes very apparent.A short time ago Dr. J. E. Talmage was requested by us to prepare a work ofmedium size and scope on subjects of practical and scientific interest; and as a result he has written a small volume entitled "Domestic Science."A committee appointed to examine thebook has heartily endorsed it as a worthy work representing an extended array of useful facts expressed in simple but forci-ble style, and imbued throughout with the spirit of our religion.We take pleasure in recommending the little work to our people as well adapted for use in our Church schools, also in the Mutual Improvement Associations, and for general reading.Your brethren in the gospel,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO. Q. CANNON,JOS. F. SMITH. 
 FROM MONAY'S DAILY, MAY 14, 1888.Y.M.M.I.A. CONFERENCE.A general conference of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associa-tions will be held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, on Saturday and Sun-day June 2nd and 3rd. Meetings will commence each day at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.The general and local authorities of the Church are requested to promote the interests of this conference, so far as they are able, that it may be largely attended and productive of the ut-most good.A general invitation to the people is extended to be present.WILFORD WOODRUFF,JOSEPH F. SMITH,MOSES THATCHER,General SuperintendencyY.M.M.I.A. 
 DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLEAT MANTI.IT has been decided to dedicate the Manti Temple on MONDAY, MAY 21, 1888. The dedicatory services will commence at 10 o'clock a.m.The Quarterly Conference of the Sanpete Stake will be held on Satur-day and Sunday, the 19th and 20th of May.It may be necessary to continue the service of dedication more than one day. This will depend upon the number of persons who may be pres-ent, and who may desire to witness and take part in the proceedings. At Logan the number of persons pres-ent was so great that it required three days' services to enable all who desired to be present to get admis-sion to the Temple.The facilities for reaching Manti are not so good as they were for reach-ing Logan. The Utah Central Rail-road runs from the north and south to Nephi. At that point the Sanpete Valley Railroad connects with it and reaches into Sanpete as far as Ches-ter, a distance of about fifteen miles from Manti. From this point convey-ance will necessarily be by teams.While it is desirable that all the offi-cers and members of the Church who can possibly be present at the dedica-tion should be three [there], still it will be necessary for all who go, to maketheir own arrangements for transpor-tation from Chester to Manti, and also for their entertainment while there, either at Manti or some of the adjacent settlements. The accommodations at Manti are limited; but on such an oc-casion as this, no doubt, everything will be done that is possible by the residents to make the visitors com-fortable and to furnish th  the nec-essary entertainment.By addressing letters to the Presidency of the Sanpete Stake—President Canute Peterson and his Counselors, Henry Beal and John B. Maiben—or to Super-intendent William H. Folsom, of the Manti Temple, arrangements, doubt-less, can be made by visitors both for transportation and accommodation.Admission to the Dedication services will be by ticket. These tickets will be given to the Presidents of Stakes, and, in their absence, to their Coun-selors or the Bishops, and by them will be distributed to the members of their Stakes and Wards who are in good standing. It will be well for themembers who desire to go to Manti on this occassion to ascer-tain beforehand whether the Presi-dency of the Stake or the Bishop andCounselors of the Ward to which theybelong will be at the Dedicaton ser-vices; for if none of these should bepresent, they ought to provide them-selves, before leaving home, with let-ters of recommendation, so that they may be admitted to the Temple with-out question.Special rates on the railroads willbe made to all persons going to and returning from Manti on this occa-sion.WILFORD WOODRUFF,On behalf of the Council of the Apostles.

 THE CONTRIBUTOR.A MONTHLY MAGAZINE.JUNIUS F. WELLS,EDITOR AND PUBLISHER.TERMS:Two Dollars a Year, In Advance.SALT LAKE CITY, JULY, 1884.ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE ELDERS.I WOULD rather have a son in the vine-yard, saving the souls of men, than to have him heaping up gold at home andbecoming a millionaire. Yes, I thankGod that the young men of Israel arerising up and going forth into the vine-yard and magnifying the Holy Priest-hood, and preparing themselves to fulfiltheir high destiny in this important dis-pensation. As I look over the historyof this Church and kingdom of God on the earth, and think of the army of faith-ful laborers in the kingdom who havepassed to the other side of the vail, andrealize that I soon shall follow them, and as I draw near to the close of my testi-mony and labor in the flesh, my anxietygreatly deepens and increases concern-ing the rising generation which I am to leave behind me in these mountains ofIsrael. I am thoroughly satisfied in myown mind that there never was a genera-tion of young men and maidens since the world was, that had awaiting themthe same high destiny that awaits the young men and maidens who dwell inthese valleys, surrounded by the ever-lasting hills, upon whose heads rest theblessings which the old Patriarch Jacobsealed upon the heads of his sons,Joseph and Ephraim, and their posterity.Through their lineage the sons anddaughters who inhabit these mountainsclaim, and, as God lives, will inherit theblessings sealed upon the head of Ephraim in the last days.We are living in a momentous age,and events as weighty as ever restedupon the earth will have to be met bythe generation which follows us. The whole earth is groaning under theweight of darkness, crime, corruptionand abominations, and its inhabitantsare preparing themselves for the out-pouring of the just judgments and in-dignation of an avenging God. In the midst of this scene of events, where will either heaven or earth look for a people, except the sons and daughtersof Zion, to hold the helm of state, or toprepare a place of safety that mortalmen may stand in holy places and bepreserved, while the great judgments ofGod sweep the wicked from off theearth, in fulfilment of the revelations ofSt. John and other Apostles and Prophetswho spoke as they were moved upon bythe Holy Ghost? Though heaven andearth pass away, not one jot or tittle ofwhat has been predicted will fall unful-filled. Neither God nor angels look toany other people than the Latter-daySaints—the Elders of Israel, the youngmen of Zion, to go forth bearing theHoly Priesthood to warn this Christian,Gentile generation with the Gospel ofJesus Christ of the judgments which are to come; and their testimony will provea savor of life unto life or of death untodeath to all who hear it.Therefore, ye Elders of Israel, andyoung men who are in the vineyard ofthe Lord, or who dwell in Zion, prepare yourselves for that which is to come. Takeupon yourselves the whole armor ofGod, and bear a true and faithful testi-mony unto all people where providencemay call you, that your garments maybe clean from the blood of all men, forthe eyes of all the heavenly hosts ofGod, angels and men, are watching overyou with feelings of the deepest inter-est. You are called and ordained of God to prepare this great and mightywork for the coming of the Son of Man.The Lord has said, through the mouthof His servant Joseph, that "you arecommanded of God to go to all thegreat and notable cities and villages, re-proving the world in righteousness of alltheir unrighteous and ungodly deeds,setting forth clearly and understandinglythe desolation of abomination in the last 
 The subject to which the Hon. W. H. Rowe and his associates, as the execu-tive commission for Utah of the National Irrigation Congress, which meets at Denver September 3, 1894, calls yourattention, is one of great importance to our Territory and people. The information asked for is needed to have our Territory and its agricultural inter-ests appear in their proper light before the nation, and especially the neighbor-ing states and territories; and moreover, that as a State Utah shall become a potent factor in framing the public irrigation legislation of the future. We, therefore, take this method of calling your atten-tion to these requests, and take the liberty of emphasizing what the com-mission have said, that our influence may be joined to theirs in impressing you with the importance of giving them the fullest aid and information, and that, too, at once.Very respectfully, your brethren,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON,JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 TO THE PUBLIC.It having been stated that Mr. A. J. Stewart, of Utah County, has repre-sented himself, while in the East and in Mexico, as an agent of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the purchase of lands in Mexico, and for colonizing our people thereon, I have pleasure in stating to the public through this notice that Mr. Stewart wholly disclaims having made, here or elsewhere, any such claim.Mr. Stewart's operations in such matters have nothing whatever to do with the Church; and the Saints hav-ing business in Mexico, or who con-template investing means or making homes in that country, would do well to consult with Elder Moses Thatcher at Logan, Cache County, Utah, or Elder A. F. Macdonald, at Juarez, Canton Galeana, Chihuahua, Mexico or with Bishop Wm. D. Johnson, Jr at Diaz, Canton Galeana Chihuahua,Mexico.WILFORD WOODRUFF.

 days; for with you, saith the Lord Al-mighty, I will rend their kingdoms: I will not only shake the earth, but the starry heavens shall tremble; for I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exertthe powers of heaven; ye cannot see itnow, yet a little while and ye shall seeit, and know that I am, and that I will come and reign with my people. I amAlpha and Omega, the beginning andthe end. Amen."Thus, ye Elders of Israel, with the word of the Lord resting upon you, whatmanner of men ought ye to be? Girdup the loins of your minds—watch andbe sober. Be ye clean that have the words of the Lord, that ye may be free from the blood of this generation. Ifyou labor all the days of your life andsave one soul, how great will be yourjoy in the kingdom of God with thatsoul! How much more if ye save manysouls!The Lord has called His servants intothe vineyard to prune it for the last time,and He is also often showing us, by revelation, the great events that are atour doors—the gathering of Israel, the return of the Ten Tribes, the fall ofBabylon, the judgments of God, theoverthrow of the wicked, and all that isto transpire in the hour of God's judg-ment, and the final coming of the Sonof Man in the clouds of heaven to re-ward every man according to the deedsdone in the body. I say, after the Lordhas set all these things before us, Hesays unto us, "If you believe me youwill labor while the day lasts, for soonnight will come when no man can work."There are great events at the door. Thisgeneration knows not what awaits them.When the people reject the testimony ofthe Elders of Israel and turn them fromtheir doors, they little know what theyare doing or what their reward will be;and while our nation is laboring for thedestruction of the Church and kingdomof God, and trample under their feet thelaws and Constitution which have beenbequeathed unto us by our forefathersthrough the inspiration of AlmightyGod, they little know of the seed theysow or the fearful harvest they are doomed to reap. These eternal truths rest with weight upon my mind.The historian says: "The decline andfall of Rome was attributable to the gen-eral corruption of the people, and to theengrossing love of pleasure and idle-ness. Work, in the last days of Rome,was regarded as only fit for slaves. Itscitizens ceased to pride themselves onthe virtues and characters of their greatforefathers, and the empire fell becauseit did not deserve to live. When nation-al character ceases to be upheld, a na-tion may be regarded as next to lost.When it ceases to esteem and to prac-tice the virtues of truthfulness, honesty,integrity and justice, it does not deserveto live."The historian, in this respect, has onlydrawn the picture of what has followedall cities, nations and kingdoms of the whole earth from the creation of the world until now, and will continue untilthe end of the world. The history ofSodom and Gomorrah, the antediluvianworld, and of Thebes, Memphis, Nine-veh, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon the Great, as well as Jerusalem itself, all have fallenwhen they were ripened in iniquity, andall this in fulfilment of the word of the Lord through the mouths of holy men,who spoke as they were moved upon by the inspiration of eternal truth. TheLord has already swept off two greatnations from the American continent, infulfilment of His word, when they wereripened in iniquity, and what inspiredman can look with indifference upon thevortex into which the American govern-ment is hastening, through the same pro-cess, to their utter destruction and over-throw? Who will save the American flagand Consititution? I heard Joseph Smithsay, the Elders of Israel would have itto do, and he was a Prophet of God.Therefore, prepare yourselves, O yenations of the earth, for that whichawaits you, for the God of heaven has acontroversy with the nations! The Lordwill disappoint no one for the want ofthe fulfilment of any of His words; andwhen I reflect that there is not one of the Apostles dwelling in the flesh whoopened the doors of salvation in the 
 TO THE Y.M.M.I.A.OFFICE OF GENERAL SUPERINTEN-DENCY Y.M.M.I.A.,SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 15, 1895.To the Officers and Members of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations throughout Zion:Dear Brethren—There have already been issued and distributed among the Stakes of Zion 17,500 copies of the Mutual Improvement Association Manual, Part I, and still there is a de-mand for this work for use among new members of these associations. Thereis also a call for a compilation of ad-vanced lessons of Manual, Part II, which have been and will continue to be published in the Contributor.Through the failure of the young men in paying their annual fifty cent donations the General Superintend-ency are unable to publish and distrib-ute free these works, upon which the success of the associations so greatly depends.Under the pressing circumstances it is deemed advisable to secure the pub-lication of a new edition of Manual, Part I, and a pamphlet containing twelve lessons in each of the subjects planned for Manual, Part II.The Contributor Co., therefore, act-ing under our approval and advice, will issue another edition of Part I of the Manual, which they will sell the associations at twenty-five cents (25c.) per copy postpaid, with reasonable re-duction in quantities.They will also issue for the use of the associations which have completed Part I, and need some more advanced studies, a pamphlet containing the first twelve (12) lessons in each of the subjects planned for Part II. This will be sold at fifteen cents (15c.) per copy, postpaid.Both of these pamphlets will be on sale at the Contributor Office, Salt Lake City, where they can be ob-tained at any time after December 26, 1894.We hope the young men will take an interest in these lessons and pur-chase them regularly, thus acquiring a fund of information which will be use-ful to them in the ministry,  either at home or abroad.Your Brethren in the Gospel,WILFORD WOODRUFF,JOSEPH F. SMITH, MOSES THATCHER.

 PIONEER REMINISCENCES.The Builder of the First Chimney—Father of the First Child—Mak-er of the First Gaiter Boots—A General and Local Pioneer.We are permitted to present the fol-lowing interesting communication:TOQUERVILLE, Washington County,Utah Territory.President Wilford Woodruff:Dear Brother— In the midst of all theups and downs that we as a people arecalled upon to pass through in thislower world, I still feel it a joy andsatisfaction to celebrate the Twenty-ty-fourth of July, our Pioneer Day.In looking over the DESERET NEWSmatter from Monday's daily of July23, 1888, I feel flattered with the eulogytherein contained, not particularly onaccount of the praise to those alonewho were pioneers, for they in realitycould not do so any different. But, praiseto God, our heavenly Father, whopioneered us here. Although I wasnot numbered among the 143 who cameas that noble band, I was with younearly all the way from Green River,and only stayed back to let the Presi-dent's company keep on the lead.You remember coming out on the eastbench to meet the battalion detach ment, under Captain James Brown. Iwas then one of the boys, and I im-mediately went to work making ado-bies and laying them up into the fortwall of what was called the Old Fort,of which I believe I built about one-half with my own hands. I know Ibuilt the first chimney that ever drewsmoke in these valleys. It was forPresident Brigham Young, in a loghouse on the east side of the Fort.As it is comforting to recount thereminiscences of the past, when theybring pleasing recollections of havingdone our duty, and as there mustalways be a first, I have the honor of being the father of theFIRST CHILD BORN IN THE VALLEY.It was named after President Young,Young Elizabeth Steele, born August9th, 1847, at 3:40 a.m. I also madethe first lasts and the first gaiter bootsthat were made in these valleys. I cannow say with pleasure that that samebaby girl, then born, is a handsomematron, having married one Mr. JamesStapley, and now lives at Kanarrah,Iron County, Utah Territory. She isthe mother of five sons and two daughters, and is now a grandmother.I was one of the Pioneers who cameto Iron County with President GeorgeA. Smith, in 1850, and have helped todevelop this Southern country, takingan active part in building up and de-[f]ending our possessions from Indianand white men's depredations. I also spent two years on a mission among[t]he Indians and enjoyed myself verymuch among them, and do not thinkthe Red man beyond the pale of re-demption. I have observed many goodtraits of character among them; oneis, that they are generally true to their[f]riends.I take great comfort in thinking overold times, and am pleased to see thatmy old friend William Carter, whoturned the first sod in the valley, has not been forgotten. He did moreditching in one day than I could do.He ditched 16 rods, three feet wideand three and half feet deep in one day.There are many of my old pioneer and soldier brethren that I remember withpleasure, and as the DESERET NEWSsays, will be remembered with pleas-ure in after generations, as their valorand integrity is not at present fully ap-preciated, but posterity will do them[j]ustice. I can rejoice to learn of the [i]ncrease of our people and the spreadof truth. Whereas, on the 24th of July,1847, there were 143 pioneers and 150battalion boys and some 20 of our sis-ters, who are mothers in Israel, also a few Mississippi Saints, who winteredat Pueblo, now in Colorade Statewho were the little nucleus aroundwhich gathered so many thousandsand have spread around into otherterritories, it makes me think of a sumin multiplication in compound num-bers. If six will multiply in fifty-eightyears into 300,000, what will 300,000 mul-tiply into in the next fifty-eight years if all are faithful in keeping the com-mandments of the Lord. If Israel hadonly allowed themselves to have beengoverned by good counsel, wherethere are now a few Saints therewould have been many. However,Israel is on the increase, and willnever be less, and the little afflictionwherewith we are afflicted is merely afatherly hint that we are not forgottenby Him. I thank God all the time thatwe are not allowed to run wild likesheep without a shepherd, and I hope the time is not far distant when we will see our Apostles and leadingbrethren among us once more.In our little town our superintend-ent of Sunday school gathered hislittle flock around him, organizedthem in good shape, and we spent our24th in singing, reciting, etc. I hadthe pleasure of making a ten minutesspeech. All went off well with adance in the evening, presided over byBrother Martin Slack.We are trying to hold the fort whileour Bishop Wm. A. Bringhurst is inprison for obeying the law of theLord. It is said in the Scriptures the time will come when the Lord willtake to Him His great power, and rule the nations, and Zion will ariseand shine.I am thankful that your health isstill good, although you are not per-mitted to be among us. I constantlypray for our leading brethren; thosewhom the Lord has chosen to lead Hispeople, and may God continue to youlong life, health and peace, and pros-perity to Israel is the constant prayer of your brother in the Gospel.JOHN STEELE.It appears proper, in connection with the foregoing, to state thatBrother Joseph Harker, of Taylors-ville, this county, claims to be thefather of the first male child born inthis valley or rather its vicinity. Hisson William Harker, who is still liv-ing in the same ward where his fatherresides, was born in Echo Cañon, Utah,while the family were traveling hither-ward, on September 26th, 1847. BrotherJoseph Harker also erected the firstcabin on the west side of Jordan River,in November and December, 1848. Wehad the pleasure of a call from theveteran this afternoon. 
 To the Pioneers and Citizens, and to theOfficers and Members of the SabbathSchools:My Dear Friends: Forty-one yearsago this day I passed through Emigra-tion Cañon with President' Brigham Young. He was taken sick on EastCañon Creek, and I made a bed for himin my carriage. When we came uponthe bench I turned the sideof the vehicle to the west so that he could obtain a fair view of the valley.President Young arose from his bedand took a survey of the country be-fore him for several minutes. He thensaid to me, "Drive on down in[t]o the valley, this is our abiding place. I have seen it before in vision. In thisvalley will be built the City of theSaints and the Temple of our God."I drove down to the encampent al-ready formed by a portion ofour company, who had cut a road through the quakingasp grovesof timber which were in the bed of the cañon and come in ahead of us.We arrived in the encampment athalf-past eleven of the morning of the24th of July, 1847. The brethren hadalready turned out City Creek and irri-gated the dry and barren soil, beingthe first irrigation ever performed byany one in these mountains in this age.They had also commenced to ploughsome ground, and that noble pioneer,William Carter, whose circumstancesprevent his meeting with the pioneerstoday, broke the first ground and laidthe first furrow. The plowshare thatperformed the work is on the stand to-day. On my arrival in camp, before I ate my dinner, I planted two bushelsof potatoes in the ground broken up.President Young commenced to re-cover from his sickness the hour heentered the valley. On a day or twofollowing our arrival, a remarkable in-cident occurred.While President Young was walkingwith several of the Apostles on thehigher ground northwest of our en-campment, he suddenly stepped out,stuck his cane into the barren groundand sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Righthere will stand the Temple of ourGod." We had a peg driven down andit was nearly in the middle of theTemple as it stands today, which Tem-ple was built without any regard to thespot designated by President Young atthe time.On the 26th, we went to thetop of a high point on thenorth of the city, which Presi-dent Young named "Ensign Peak."We also visited the Hot and WarmSprings. On the 27th we drove to theWest Mountains and visited the SaltLake, President Young being the first todip his hand into the briny water. Wewalked dryshod to the Black Rock andtook a bath in the Lake. Afterwardspreparations were made for laying outthe city, and I with other brethren as-sisted President Young in laying outthe ground and streets with chain andcompass. We laid out a block of tenacres upon which to build a Temple,and city lots of one acre and aquarter, and streets eight rods wide,all of which has been published by his-torians.President Young left Winter Quar-ters on the seventh day of April, ac-companied by seven other Apostles andother men, all told 143 men and 3women. The Apostles were BrighamYoung, Heber C. Kimball, W. Wood-ruff, George A. Smith, Willard Rich-ards, Orson Pratt, Amasa Lyman andEzra T. Benson. Parley [P.] Pratt andJohn Taylor arrived soon after, lead-ing companies of families. OrsonHyde remained at Kanesville. We trav-eled the first 500 miles without any grass. With the exception of a littlegrain we fed our animals, they livedentirely on the bark of cottonwoodlimbs and saplings, which theygnawed from the trees we wouldlay before them for their night'smeal. This company of 143 mentraveled 1030 miles, making theirroads and building their bridges. Inone instance we had to form a guardof a wedge shape for three days andnights to keep our company from beingtrampled to death by an enormousherd of buffalo that had gathered from the mountains and were migrating ina solid body to the plains below. Theherd was judged to be sixty miles inlength, and numbered not less thanone million. They were traveling eastand we were traveling west. We werethree days passing though the herd,and we all breathed freer when wewere clear of them. No other class ofmen will ever witness the same sceneagain upon the face of the earth.Brother Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., gothis horses loose and mixed with theherd, and it was with great difficultythat we obtained them again.Notwithstanding our first care wasto secure an abiding place, a home forthe people, we did not lose sightof other important matters. PresidentYoung contemplated at that early daythe building of a railroad across thecontinent, and we marked out theroute which we thought the nationalroad would take to unite the Atlanticand Pacific oceans.Brothers Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow entered the valley two or threedays before the body of the pioneers;but where are those men today, andwhere is President Brigham Young andthe Apostles who accompanied him?All are in the spirit world minglingwith the martyred Prophets wherethey can plead for their brethren. Notone of them living today except my-self, and but few of the pioneers re-main. We have buried a whole quo-rum of Twelve Apostles since we en-tered these valleys of the mountains.The remnant of Zion's Camp, MormonBattalion and the Pioneers number butvery few today. Those of us who re-main will soon pass away, but ourposterity live and are numbered in the Primaries, the Sabbath schools andthe Mutual Improvement Associa-tions, and are this day assembled inthis great Tabernacle to celebrate thearrival of the Pioneers into this greatAmerican Deseret, which todaythrough the blessing of God and thelabor of the Pioneers is blossoming asthe rose.This company of pioneers spentabout a month in this valley duringwhich period we erected what is known as the Old Fort, surroundingthree sides of the ten-acre block, withan adobie wall about ten feet high onthe outside, and the east side with logcabins. We also arranged for this fortto have four entrances, one on eachpoint of the compass.Most of the Pioneers returned toWinter Quarters where they arrivedin the fall, making a jorney of overtwo thousand miles, besides the laborsperformed while here in building afort, laying out the city and exploringthe adjacent valleys.I wish to say a few words to themembers of the Sabbath Schools andto all who are assembled in this Tab-ernancle today to celebrate the arrival ofthe Pioneers into this valley. It is notwisdom for me to occupy your timewith a long address upon an occasionof this kind, but I have referred to afew incidents of our peculiar journeyinto this barren desert, that you maykeep in mind the toil, the care and theharships which your fathers enduredin laying the foundation of the Zion ofour God which is to be established in the mountains of Israel, in fulfillmentof the blessing of the old Patri-arch Jacob pronounced upon his pos-terity that should be fulfilled in thevalleys of the everlasting hills in thelatter-days. And upon the heads ofthe rising generation of the Latter-day Saints rests the responsiblity ofbuilding up the Kingdom of God uponthe foundations which their fathershave laid. And also of building up aState in which shall dwell virtue, tem-perance, industry, frugality and hon-esty; a State which will do honor to the American government, wherewholesome laws shall be administedin equity and justice to all of its citizens according to the letter and spiritof the Constitution given by inspira-tion of Almighty God to our fore-fathers.I feel to say to our children, Honoryour father and your mother and yourGod, that your days may be long andprosperous in these valleys ol [of] themountains which the Lord your Godhath given unto you.That God may bless you all, and en-able you to fulfill the object of yourcreation here on the earth to the satis-faction of yourselves and your Crea-tor, is the earnest desire of your friendand brother,WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 President Woodruff said sixty yearsago this season he traveled with theProphet Joseph a thousand milesin Zion's camp. There were three ofthat camp here today. Forty-sevenyears ago he entered this valley withthe Prophet Brigham. He did notthen expect to see such a place as thisbuilt by the Latter-day Saints. Heblessed the people and expressed the hope that they might have the privi-lege of associating together on theother side of the veil, when they werecalled hence. 
 British dominions in 1837, and but two who assisted in baptizing some seventhousand in 1840, and that our mis-sion and labors will soon be found uponthe other side of the vail—I say, whilethese reflections rest upon me, I feel de-sirous to urge upon my brethren, theElders of Israel, to labor faithfully whilethe day lasts. Try to save the souls of men. Bless and not curse. Keep pureand clean before the Lord. Pray ear-nestly for the Holy Spirit to guide you.Be patient in well doing. If you arepersecuted and derided for the Gospel'ssake, remember that Jesus has trod that road before you, and descendedlower than ever you will be called to go;and if you are cast out of doors and gethungry, have to travel on foot, get wearyand sore, and are without money, re-member that others, even your fathersafter the flesh, have passed through thesame ordeal. Brigham and Heber, Wil-lard and John, Parley and Orson, Wil-ford and George A., have traveled overthe same road, preached in the samehalls and streets, got hungry the sameas you are. We are all in the same oldship of Zion, and thanks be to God forthe privilege.Be of good cheer. Though earth andhell conspire against you, they shall notprevail if you are built upon my rock,saith the Lord. May the blessings andpower of God, with His Holy Spirit, restupon all the Elders and Saints of Godin the vineyard of the Lord, as well asthose in Zion.Wilford Woodruff.Where law ends, tyranny begins. 
 Written for this Paper.SOUTHERN STATES MISSION.Following is the report of theSouthern States mission, made toPresident Wilford Woodruff, by ElderKimball:Having finished my labors in theSouthern States, I desire to make a written report, trusting that it will besatisfactory and meet with your ap-proval.The mission is in excellent condi-tion, and in no other time since 1877has there been as good an opportunityfor proselyting. There are 126 effici-ent Elders laboring in the South, andthey are the best qualified laborersthe mission has ever had at any onetime. There is not a sick Elder atpresent writing.We find that about twelve per centof the Elders are honorably releasedon account of sickness. Brethren overforty years old, in almost every in-stance are released on account of illhealth before the two years expire, andwe can only remember of one man ofthat age remaining that long.The 126 Elders are laboring in 63counties. During the three years that I have presided 98 counties have beensystematically canvassed, from houseto house, village to village, and city to city. Said counties are closed, for thepresent at least.There are 1,150 counties in thetwelve Southern States, with a popula-tion of between sixteen and seventeenmillion people. By a great deal ofhard work we have ascertained that371 counties have been labored in tosome extent since 1877, and duringthat time 877 Elders have labored inthe South. By this we conclude that not one-third of the people ever heardthe Gospel.The last quarterly report shows thatwe have a total of 1,859 members,twelve branches and six Sundayschools.The following report will give an [i]dea of the labors of the mission fromJan. 1st, 1894, to April 30th, 1894:Pairs of Elders walked 42,194 miles.Meetings held, 897. Families visited,16,576. Refused entertainment (oneout of every five families), 3,211.Baptisms (will increase to 300 or 350during the year), 71. Tracts distrib-uted, 22,359. This will complete myreport, and in conclusion I will statethat I am one hundred fold rewardedfor my labors, and thank you verymuch for the good counsel and manyacts of kindness extended to me, all ofwhich I appreciate.Elder Elias S. Kimball, my suc-cessor, is now familiar with his duties.The mission's finance is all right andthe debts all paid. At Chattanooga wehave many influential friends, andfind a most remarkable change in ourfavor.Ever praying for your welfare andthat of our brethren of the authorities.I remain,Your brother in the Gospel, etc.,J. G. KIMBALL. 
 THE SAMOAN MISSION.Interesting Account and StatisticsFrom its President.AUNUU, Samoan Islands,October 30th, 1888.President Wilford Woodruff:Dear Brother: Onr [Our] new mission-aries, Elder Wm. O. Lee, wife andchild, and Elders Adelbert Beesley andEd. J. Wood arrived on the 10th inst.,safe and sounds, and were met byBrother Manoa and myself with acrew of natives, at the steamer. Wehad a terrible time waiting for thesteamer, however, as it was four daysbehind advertized time, having had towait in San Francisco for the Britishmails.  We spent most of that timeday and night, in sun and rain, out tosea in the open boat, fearing to goashore lest, when the steamer came,we could not reach it in time. Afterlooking anxionsly at the horizon fromSaturday noon till Tuesday night invain, and being quite exhansted fromexposure and want of sleep, we werequite disheartened. Wednesday morn-ing at daylight, however, the steamerwas sighted, and we immediately for-got all our troubles and put off tomeet her.The schooner that takes the mail gotthere first, however, and being four days behind time the officers of the steamer would not delay a second the bundling of the baggage for Samoainto her. So by the time we got theremost of the brethren's baggage hadbeen transferred, and we had to pay $2for the accommodation of getting itaway from them again.  We finally gotevery thing all right and had a prettypleasant passage in our boat to Aunuu.We arrived here next morning at 9o'clock, badly worn out bodily, butfeeling well in spirits. Brother Manoawas taken down with a heavy feverthrongh exposure and exhaustion, henot being very strong. The rest of uswere all right after a night's rest.Manoa is around all right again now.Your kind letter sent by the brethren,together with the shoes, shoe-mending"kit" and medicines came all rightand was greatly appreciated, the shoes especially. Our friends also remem-bered us in a very liberal manner.God bless you all for yonr kindness.You say you wrote me under date of August 13. It has never reached me,nor have other letters for the same month. But I think, probably, I willget them yet, when we can go for onrmail.Since I last wrote you, Brother C. K.Kapule has arrived from the SandwichIslands. He got here Aug. 13th, andhas been here ever since. He has soldall that he had on the Sandwich Is-lands (some $3000 worth of property)and when he is released from his mis-sion he intends to go to Utah. It will be quite a task for him to get thelanguage, but he is stndying diligentlyand will soon be able to talk some I think.On Aug. 27th Brother Kapule and Iwent to the island of Tutnila for aweek's missionary trip. Two days af-terward Manoa sent me word thatthere was great exitement on Annuuthrough word having reached there tothe effect that the governor of Tntuilahad received orders from the Germansto have me and all those who hadjoined the Church arrested and takento Apia. He thonght I had better re-turn immediately. Not wishing to doso until I had visited the settlementsor villages that I desired to, I sentback word where I would be each dayuntil I returned, and that if any officerwanted me they were to direct himwhere to find me. I was inclined to think the thing was all a canard at first, but subsequent investigation hasshown that there was considerable foundation for the report. Of courseyou are aware that the Germans havebeen dictating affiars here for a yearor two past. A German named Bran-daus has been prime minister to theKing. His salary was $250 per month,the king's $25, and the Chinamancook's $30. This Brandans havingheard that we were here and meetingwith considerable snccess, sent wordto the governor of Tutuila and Aununto proclaim on the two islands that if,after the proclamation, any Samoanshould join the Church he should beimprisoned. That was the foundationupon which the first rumors we heardwere founded. A week or so after thegovernor started to "proclaim;" hehad not got many miles from home be-fore a vessel arrived from the capitalbringing word that the natives on theisland of Upoln had taken up armsagainst the government and over-thrown it, and had chosen Mataala asking. The governor said if that wasthe case he would return, for if thegovernment were overthrown he wasgovernor no longer. And that was thelast we have heard of the matter, of-ficially.The war altogether has been confinedto Upolu, and has consisted of threebattles in which the rebels have beenvictorious. Both parties are still inarms and which way it will finally bedecided depends upon the action of thegreat powers, England, Germany andAmerica. Since the scare started, that is, that those who joined the Church would be arrested, we have had butone application for baptism, and thata young boy. A good many are believ-ing, but they are afraid the Germans willreturn to power and that the threat willbe carried out. They say there is noneed for hurrying, and they will waitand see how things turn out. Whenthe war is over and things quiet downagain, if the German's retain theirgrip (which they are almost sure to doI am afraid) and the natives are stillafraid of being arrested, I think I shallgo to the capital and begin work rightat headquarters, and thereby soundthe thing to the bottom and see what they will do. I can bear anything bet-ter than nncertainty. I feel certainthat the Lord will overrule it all forgood. We have received quite an ex-tensive advertizing as it is.I have not done mnch missionarywork yet outside of this little islandfor several reasons. Having someforty souls here that have accepted mytestimony and joined the Church, I thought it foolish to leave them in ig-norance and rnn to hunt other bap-tisms, until I could ground themsnfficiently in the faith that theycould stand alone, or until some onecould come and take my place. My policy has always been to labor ashard to keep a member as to get a newone and not to spread my wings overmore eggs than I can keep warm. And to carry the hen comparison a littlefurther, I can assure yon it has keptme busy "clucking aud scratching" to keep my little brood straight. Anotherreason is that I have had to get the language, which I bave not yet ac-complished by considerable, havingbeen here but a little over four montbs,and I have also been working with the natives building us a meeting house.Since the brethren arrived we havebeen working every day together on it,and finally got it finished last Saturday.It is 36 x 18 feet and very comfortable and commodious, and we all feelproud of it. The roof is of thatch-work of cocoanut leaves. The postsare ronnd cocoanut trees with thebark hewn off and the floor is coveredwith clean white coral pebbles fromthe beach with a good sprinkling ofsea shel[l]s among them. I made a stand by hewing a large cocoanut treeflat on one side and placing it flat sideup on two posts firmly planted in the ground. I made it as nice as I couldwith a hatchet and an old jack planethat Manoa has.Elder Wood says it is a nice piece offurnitnre, and he ought to know hav-ing worked in Brother Dinwoodey's store. In commemoration of the completion of the house, we had afeast last Saturday, and then an entertainment, which was quite cred-itably rendered, and pleased the na-tives immensely. It consisted ofhymns by us missionaries. Xylophoneand violin solos by Elder Beesley,speeches, etc., and songs in Hawaiian.On Sunday, October 28, we held ourfirst Conference. All the missionarieswere present, also all the Saints thatcould come. We sang hymn 64, Sa-moan Church of England hymn book, beginniug with the words "Ua tele leAlofa."  I offered prayer and dedi-cated our new meeting house to the Lord. The missionaries then sang"Come, come ye Saints, no toil norlabor fear." I explained to the peo-ple the nature of a conference as heldsemi-annually in the church, and thenpresented the Anthorities of theChurch, and all voted to sustain them with their faith and prayers.The statistical report of the missionwas then read, which is as follows:Statistical report, Samoan Mission, toOctober 6, 1888:Missionaries—Male, 0, female, 2.Elders, 2. Priests, 1.  Deacons, 3.Total officers, 6. Members—Male, 13,female, 16; total members, 29; totalofficers and members, 35. Childrenunder 8—Male, 2, female, 8; total chil-dren, 10; total souls, 56. Deaths, 1.We also organized a Sunday School and Relief Society, with the followingofficers, who were unanimously sus-tained:Wm. O. Lee Superintendent of theSunday School; A. Beesley and S.Manoa, counselors, F. R. Dean, Presi-dent of the Rellef Society; Louisa C.Lee and Leutuva, Counselors.  Pa-loga was chosen a missionary to travelwith me on the island of Tutuila.  Hewas ordained a Priest.  Chief Lemazamade a few remarks.  Singing.  Bene-diction by S. Manoa.Met again at 3 p.m. Prayer by Le-mafa.  Brother C. K. Kapnle aroseand made his "maiden" speech in theSamoan langnage.  The rest of themeeting was occupied by myself andElder W. O. Lee, the latter of coursespeaking in English, which I interpre-ted.  Singing.  Dismissed by Brother Beesley.  Thus ended our first confer-ence on the Samoan Islands.Having got our meeting house doneand the new missionaries settled, Inow feel justified in leaving Aunuu incharge of Brothers Lee, Kapule and Manoa, and taking Elders Beesley andWood with me and Paloga to make athorough canvass and circuit of Tu-tuila.  There are some 3000 inhabitants,and it will probably take ns two months to go around.  We leave dayafter tomorrow, nothing preventing.I am mnch pleased with the spiritmanifested by the brethren, and be-lleve they will make good mission-aries.  They are stndying hard toget the language, and feel well inevery way.  They are also taking tothe food very well, but Sister Leecan't get along quite so well, bnt willgradually get used to it I think.Brother Manoa has given up his en-tire house to us and is living by him-self in another he has adjoining.  Hehas been financially embarrassed, how-ever, for some time, and can thereforenot help us financially.  We wouldfeel much better in a honse of ourown.  There is no use thinking ofmaking this little island our perma-nent headquarters, however.  Thereis no land to be gotten.  We are 78 miles from supplies and mail connec-tions, and a way from the great body ofthe natives.  What we need is a fewacres of ground in some good situationon the island of Upolu, where we could build our own honses and growour own food and be near mail con-nections aud base of supplies.  Butthese things will have to be developedin the future as circumstances permit.As yet I am single handed and alone,practically, being the only one that canspeak the language.  It will take twoor three years to get things wellstarted, as the brethren have to havetime to get the langnage, and we haveto take things as we find them andmake the best of them.We all feel well in the work in whichwe are engaged, and there seems to bea lively and energetic spirit among allthe missionaries.  On account of the unsettled condition of affairs on theislands I don't think it wonld be wisefor any more missionaries to come atpresent, though a dozen Elders with the language could be used to good advantage.The brethren and sisters all send af-fectionate regards.  And we all praythat you may be strengthened andblessed, and preserved from your ene-mies.Please to remember me kindly toBrother Geo. Q Cannon and thebrethren at the office.Your brother in the Gospel,JOSEPH H. DEAN. 
 SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 24, 1894.Wilford Woodruff, President of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints:Dear sir: Heretofore the  Tribune hasreported you and others in authorityin your Church as giving utterance to the sentiment that the Mormon peopleought to divide upon national partylines, according to the political senti-ments which each man might entertain,without interference in any way fromofficials of your Church in that mat-ter. Frequently has that utterancebeen given, and the public hascome to rely upon it as fixed andfinal. Now, however, this feeling ofsafety from Church interference in poli-tics has been disturbed, and a freshsource of unrest introduced by a reportwhich appeared in the Tribune thismorning of your remarks yesterday atProvo. The report was made by a manin complete sympathy with yourself sofar as Church affairs go, and who, it iscertain, would refuse to misreport you inany way. Subsequent inquiry developsthat he is confident in the accuracy ofhis report of your remarks as he under-stood them. The portion of that reportwhich causes uneasiness is the following:"It is generally thought the First Presidencyshould have nothing to say about politics," hecontinued. "I picked up a paper this morningsaying that we had no business to meddle inpolitics. We have a right to lead the people in spiritual and temporal affairs. We have thesame rights of leadership that PresidentYoung had, and that the Prophet JosephSmith had. In temporal affairs? Yes. In political affairs? Yes. We have a right to ad-vise both Democrats and Republicans to lead a pure campaign. We have a right to say to thepeople that they must be pure in politics aswell as in temporal affairs. We have thou-sands of children growing to manhood in Zion.I am interested in their welfare, and I wouldlike to see them brought up under proper in-fluences, and not under the influence of sucha campaign as we had two years ago."The purpose of this inquiry is to ascer-tain with exactness,First, whether your remarks were pre-cisely as reported, and, if not, whereinthey depart from precision.Second, if the remarks were as report-ed, then in what sense do you wish themto be understood: whether as a claim tocontrol the political actions of your peopleabsolutely, or only as a citizen to advisethe right.Third, the claim is apparently made inyour remarks that the Church authoritiesclaim the right to direct the people intheir business and politics, and, in gen-eral, their temporal affairs, as well asspiritual. It is desirable to knowwhether this claim is really made andinsisted upon at this time, and is to be inthe future, while the public has been ledto believe that claim a thing of the past.Most respectfully,TRIBUNE PUBLISHING CO. 
 Salt Lake Tribune:Gentlemen—Answering the first ques-tion in your note, I have to say that I believe the extract you quote from your report of my remarks at Provo is sub-stantially correct.To the second, my reply is that "the control of the political actions of our people absolutely" is not set up as a claimin my remarks, and I certainly would not wish them to be so understood. I hold that it is the right of the Priesthood to advise at any and all times and underany circumstances those who pro-fess to respect its powers, in all matters pertaining to their tem-poral welfare and their spiritual sal-vation; if in the matter of politics, that the Latter-day Saints should be governed by pure principles, and in po-litical affairs should realize and act upon their responsibilities as Saints and citizens. This is not to claim the rightto advise them how or for whom they should vote, or which party they should join. We emphatically and sincerely approved the division of the Mormon people on party lines, and we recognize every man's agency and respect his right to choose in these matters for himself. We have not advised, and do not advise our people how they shall vote; the elections that have been heldin this Territory since politics on na-tional party lines was introduced, are proof of this policy; we have asked noRepublican to vote the Democratic tick-et, and no Democrat to vote the Repub-lican ticket; we have never advised mento vote other than their convictions prompted them, and have no intention of giving such advice. At the same time, we claim the right, both as indi-viduals and as leaders of the Church, to counsel our people to keep aloof fromthe corruption, the scandal and the filfth of politics as too frequently practiced in the world, to set an example in this as in other things, and it is in this sense that I wish to be understood as as-serting the right of the Priesthood to givecounsel in political affairs. As citizens we have the right of opinion and of speech; we also have responsibilities and duties to ourselves and to others; butuntil the foregoing can be construed asmeddling in politics, I shall be unable tofind ground for the uneasiness of which you speak. However, in the light ofthis statement of my meaning and views,I trust there can be no further cause of anxiety or unrest; I assure you there isno foundation for it.Yours respectfully, WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE,Covering the period from the time named in their last report, made October 6,1884, until December 31, 1885.We, the undersigned, auditors ap-pointed at the General Conference ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to examine and audit thebooks and the accounts of the Trustee-in-Trust of the said Church, after a careful and thorough examination andcomparison made by ourselves and by competent assistants, of the receipts ofcash and other property from allsources by the said Trustee-in-Trust,and the accounts of the expenditures ofthe same, during the past two years, since we made our last report, do hereby certify that we have found theaccounts strictly correct, and of themost satisfactory character. We havefound that, after allowing for the amounts paid out, the balance is fullyaccounted for by cash on hand and inventoried property.We cannot close this, our report, injustce to the Trustee-in-Trust, and forthe satisfaction of the Latter-daySaints in Conference assembled, with-out saying that we have been much gratified, in our examination of thebooks and accounts, with the prudent,economical, and strict manner in which the funds that have come intothe hands of the Trustee-in-Trust havebeen managed.All obligations have been promptlymet, the business has been placed on a most satisfactory basis, debts havebeen liquidated, and the financial con-dition and standing of the Church aremost satisfactory.This condition of the affairs is verypleasant for us to contemplate, as weknow the statement will be to the Saints in General Conference as-sembled.We remain, your brethren,WILFORD WOODRUFF,ERASTUS SNOW,FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS,Auditing Committee. 
 CIRCULAR LETTER.OFFICE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,November 22, 1894.To the Presidents of Stakes and Bishopsof Wards:DEAR BRETHREN—In December, 1891, acting un[d]er our advice an[d] direction, an associati[o]n was formedconsisting of some twenty-seven persons ([f]or the most part, sons of the Pioneers), with ours[e]lves as an advis-ory board, for the purpose of attending to the detail w[o]rk of the erection of a monument to the Pioneers of Utah and their distingui[s]hed leader, Presi-dent Brigham Young. This associa-tion immediately entered upon its duties. A contract was entered into with Mr. C. E. Dallin, a young man born in this Territory who had already attained an enviable repu-tati[o]n as a sculptor, to perform the work in accordance with designs made by him and fully approved by us. These designs provided for the erection of a monument 35 feet in height upon a granite pedestal which is to consist of the following conspicuous features: The sitting figures of an American Indian and a Rocky Mountain trapper in bronze 8 feet in height, illustrative of the primitive conditions which existed in this region before the adventof the Pioneers; a Pioneer group con-sisting of a man 8 feet in height, wo-man, child and wagon, or prairie schooner, to be cut in relief work upona marble shaft, or column, forming the central feature of the monument; the whole to be surmounted by a bronze statue of President Brigham Young, 10 feet in height. The statue of Pres-ident Young has been completed and was on exhibition at the Worl[d]'s Fai[r] in Chicago in 1893, where it receivedwidespread commendation both for thefaithfulness of the likeness and as a work of art. It is now inside the Temple Block in this city and readyto be put in place. Models of the In-dian and trapper have been executed and approved, and are ready to be re-produced in bronze as soon as [t]he neces-sary funds can be raised. A model of the Pioneer group has been submitted by the sculptor and as soon as approved can be cut in stone and made ready to b[e] put in position. The site determine[d] upon for the monument is the south-east corner of the Temple Block, near the spot where President Young stood when Utah was but a wilderness, and uttered the prophetic words: "Here we will build the temple of our God."  For all of the work above describe[d]put in position complete and [f]or super-intendence of construction of the monument, the sculptor, under the contract, is to receive $25,000. Only a few hundred dollars have as yet been subscribed and paid in.From this brief statement of the conditions you will see how necessary it is that immediate steps be taken t[o] raise funds for this important work. It is our hope that by next fall, in time for the semi-annual conference, themonument may be dedicated and un-veiled to the vision of the people who shall have contributed to build i[t]; andthere is no reason why our expecta[t]ions in this regard may not be fully realized if all the people will but take [h]old and push the project with thesame determinati[o]n and unanimity of[p]urpose which have builded our tem-[p]les and accomplished so much in the past.It is now nearly half a century since[t]he Pioneers entered this valley. Most of those whose dauntless courage and hardy prowess beat down the barriers which opp[o]sed them in that historic march of a th[o]usand miles of tracklesswilderness, overcome at last with the [f]atiques of added years, have lain their weary bodies down to rest within thetomb where sleep the brave and thejust. We who remain are reaping the[g]olden grain of their sowing—are blessed with the results of their energy and toil. Is it not fitting that we should cheerfully and gratefully contributet[o]wards the erection of a monument that will perpetuate down through the ages the memory of the hardships and privatio[n]s they endured for us? It is the intention to have a complete rosterof that illustrious band of Pioneers en-graven upon the main column of the monument, just as their noble deeds ought to be and are engraven forever upon the hearts of their posterity.We are aware that there are many and varied calls for donations for worthy purposes from the people, but it is our desire that this call shall be given first place and other consid-erations of a public nature be regarded as secondary until the work in hand shall be completed. Heber M. Wells, secretary of the Brigham Young memorial fund, Salt Lake City, is authorized to receive subscriptions, and he will take pleasure in issuing a receipt in the name ofevery contributor, no matter how small the sum. We extend an invita-tion, throu[g]h the Presidency of the various stakes and Bishops of wards, to every man, woman and child through-out our mountain home to contribute something in commemoration of the Pioneers and their great leader, Presi-dent Brigham Young, whose genius has left its impress in every part of thisfavored land. Remember that no amount, however small, will be refused,as the purpose in view is to have a monument that will belong to the people who love and revere the mem-ory of the Pio[n]eers.Trusting that you will at once takesteps for the furtherance of this work in your respective stakes and wards, and praying the Lord to bless your l[a]bors and those of the righteouseverywhere in the upbuilding of His purposes, we remain,Your brethren in the Gospel of Christ,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON,JOSEPH F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church o[f] Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 TO THE PUBLIC.There is not a scintilla of truth inthe statements which have been and are being made in certain quartersconcerning the Utah company.The Utah company is a Utah con-cern in every respect.Every dollar of its stock is owned byUtah people, viz., Wilford Woodruff,George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith, James Jack, Nephi W. Clayton,William W. Cluff and Frank J.Cannon.The Utah company is not connected in any manner with the sugar trust.It has had no dealings with that trust,or with any of its representatives.We cannot say whether any repre-sentatives of the sugar trust were orare in Utah. We do not know them.The inuendoes which associate any ofthe undersigned with a proposition toelect sugar trust senators are utterlygroundless and without any degree of truth.No papers connected with the Utahcompany were signed at Provo at anytime. The articles of incorporationwere signed at Salt Lake City, filed inthe public office here, and their con-tents have been current knowledgeever since.We have no knowledge that theLehi sugar works are to be closed down.We should much deplore such a cal-amity.In our judgment, the insinuationsrecently made against the businesspurposes of the Utah company or itsmembers are not only unjust to thembut injurious to the community whosefinancial redemption the Utah com-pany is seeking to aid.WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q.

 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S VIEWS.THE following account of an in-terview between President Wood-ruff and an Associated Press re-porter, who was in this city a fewdays ago, is published in the easternpapers:SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 11—Presi-dent Woodruff, the head of the Mor-mon church, today gave to the Asso-ciated Press the only statement he hasever made upon the political fight which has just ended here. His inter-view, which is as follows, can be un-derstood as the feeling of every Mor-mon in the Territory:"President Woodruff, I would liketo get your views as to the politicalcampaign here and the questions atissue""Well, sir, I consider this as some-thing more than a mere question ofwhat men shall compose the city gov-ernment and what party they belongto. There is a deep-laid scheme to de-prive the Mormon people of all po-litical right and privileges so that the minority here may obtain control ofthe Territory. They cannot do this byfair means, so they resort to foul."By misrepresentation and takingadvantage of popular predjudice againstthe Mormon, founded chiefly in ig-norance, they succeeded in securingthe disfranchisement of the older set-tlers who made the country, and thenof all the women. This not givingthese schemers a majority, they havesought other means. The Edmunds-Tucker act has helped them some-what, but the test oath it provides canbe taken by a majority at least as wellas by their opponents."Now they want every Mormon de-prived of the right  to vote and holdoffice, no matter how good and law-abiding a citizen he may be. At the Ogden election a year ago, large num-bers of the names of resident voterswere stricken from the registrationlists, hundreds of non-residents wereimported and the election was carriedby the Liberals by open fraud, andsince then, by ficticious valuation, theassessments of property have beenraised from three to five times the for-mer amounts of taxes, vice has flour-ished, official salaries have been raised. Public improvements havenot advanced and the change is de-plored by the best people of both par-ties."Boasts were made after the Ogdenelection, that Salt Lake would be thenext point of attack, and that it wouldbe carried by similar means. The re-sult has proved the boast not to havebeen made in vain."I consider the election has been gained here by striking from the re-gistration lists hundreds of legally qualified citizens and by the votes ofhordes of new comers not lawful citi-zens."I regard the action of the registrars,their sitting as a court to judge of theirown acts, and the whole course pur-sued, as part of the scheme to capturethe city at all hazards. I view it withprofound regret as prostitution of lawand official power that should saddenevery lover of fair play and welfare ofhis country.""What effect will this change haveupon the Church and the People'sParty?""Oh, as to that I cannot see that the Church will in any way be affected asan organization. It is entirely separ-ate and apart from political matters;members of the Church belong to the People's Party, and they will natur-ally feel that they have been robbed oftheir rights at the polls. But I pre-sume that it will not affect their polit-ical views or status."The Church was not in that cam-paign and the result will have no bear-ing upon it at all that I can see.""What will be the future policy ofthe Church?""So far as I know, it will be to preach the Gospel to all the world; in-struct its members in their religiousduties, and move forward to its divini-ty-ordained destiny as the actual liv-ing Church of Christ.""Is there any probability of the Mormon Church or people removingto Mexico or elsewhere?""None that I know of. I do not seeany necessity of such removal. Indi-vidual members may go where theychoose to better their condition, butthere is not nor has there been anycontemplation of any such exodus asyou ask about.""What is the Mormon idea of itsrule as the kingdom of God?""It is this: we hold that this Churchwas set up and organized by com-mand of the Almighty; that it has theright to formulate and maintain rulesof church discipline applying to itsown members; that the extent of itspunitive powers is the excommunica-tion of the transgressor; that it has nopower to punish anyone by depriva-tion of life, liberty or property or pe[r]s-sonal injury in any form; that gov-ernments should not regulate the church, nor the church seek to controlthe state; that all men should be polit-ically free and equal, free to vote asthey please and to sustain what poli-tics they please, so that they do notinfringe upon the rights of others."We believe this Church will pre-pare the way for the coming of Christ to reign as King, and that this Churchwill then develop into the Kingdom of God, which all Christians pray will come; that the will of God may bedone on earth as it is in heaven. Webelieve in the full and free agency ofman, and that when the kingdom  isestablished there will be perfect lib-erty on earth, civil, political and re-ligious.""Then you do not feel gloomy as to the ultimate result of this election?""No, I believe taxes will be raised,that there will be such a looseness ofrestraint imposed upon immoralityand such a striking contrast formedunder Liberal rule that order, honor,honesty and consistent progress of the city under the People's regime, that asin Ogden, the more respectable peopleof all classes will soon desire a returnto former methods. The plottersagainst the majority will probably beemboldened to pursue their plans forthe destruction of a republican gov-ernment in the Territory, but I shouldbe sorry to believe that Congress orthe country will proceed to such un-constitutional and infamous extrem-ities as those that will be proposed. Inany event, there is a Power superiorto all men, who will overrule allthings that happen for the good ofthose who serve Him."President Woodruff appeared to bein good health and not in the leastworried over the result of the election.He is now in his 83rd year and ap-parently as strong and well preservedas the ordinary man at 50. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFspoke very briefly. He said he didnot believe there ever was a time inthe history of the world when thereexisted so little faith among thepeople with regard to God, His SonJesus Christ, and the gospel as wasthe case today.Just as soon as the Lord or-ganized this Church, with the sameprinciples which belonged to it inancient days, it seemed as thoughthe whole world was stirred upagainst them as a people. Theywere therefore led to ask the causeof all the opposition and persecu-tion which had attended the Latter-day Saints throughout the wholeChristian world; and the answer came "Because you differ from usin religion. You preach the gifts,graces, and revelations of JesusChrist today as taught in ancientdays, and we do not believe in them.Those things were taught in the dark ages to convince the children of men of the work of God. We nowlive in the glorious Gospel light, and we do not need them." That wasthe kind of teaching by ministers inthe present day; but he (the speak-er) would say in answer to this:"Then, for God's sake, give me thedark ages of the world."He did not believe there everlived a people either in this or anyother generation, who had beenmore lied about than the Latter-daySaints. It was astonishing howlittle these "Mormons," as they were called, were known in the world. Strangers who came intothis city would sometimes enquireof a man whom they saw standingin the street—and who had probab-ly made up his mind enough to lieabout them—something aboutthe "Mormons," and they learnedfrom him in five minutes all about"Mormonism." These people re-turned home and told what theyhad learned, and the story spreaduntil the truth was hardly everheard. It had been asserted here inyears gone by, as a reproach againstthe Latter-day Saints, that not aman or woman could send a letteranywhere out of the Territorywithout the Presidency of the Church first reading it. Such state-ments were of course false. Why,he had scarcely time to read his own letters when written, much less those of the many thousands of people who dwell here. There wasjust as much truth in that as in the statement that the Presidency toldevery Latter-day Saint how to vote. He had resided in this valley someforty-four years, and he could safelysay that during the whole of thattime, so far as he could recollect,he had never told any man orwoman how to vote. If he had told anyone, it had only been some ofhis own boys who might haveasked his advice; but he did not re-member even that.Falsehood had been spread over the whole world to such an extentthat the people hardly knew whatto believe in regard to the Latterday Saints. Some persons had ac-tually entertained the idea that the "Mormons" had horns! The speaker recited an incident bearing on thisabsurd fallacy. On one occasion, hesaid, a few Gentile gentlemen gotinto the company of a young "Mor-mon" Elder for the first time. Hewas a good-looking, bright, and in-telligent young fellow, and theywere somewhat surprised to findthat he was like other men. Theyall wore their hats at thetime, and one of the company de-sired the Elder to remove his from his head. He at once complied withthe request, remarking, however, ashe did so, "You see I am youngand my horns have not begun togrow yet."President Woodruff related an-other circumstance within his ex-perience. Some years ago he traveledfrom Ogden with a party of clergy-men. Upon their arival here, andon passing the Sixteenth Wardschoolhouse, one of the numberinquired what that building was used for. On being informed, the ques-tioner expressed his astonishment,remarking that he had no idea the"Mormons" had schools!The world was opposed to theLatter-day Saints on almost everyground; and as to revelation, it wasone of the worst things a man couldbelieve in if he wished to be popularwith the multitude outside.He urged the Latter-day Saintsto exercise faith in God, to believein Him and in His Son Jesus Christas the Savior of the world. If theywere not united they were not thepeople of God. Let them live trueto their religion, looking forward to the promises which God had madeunto them, and which He wouldassuredly fulfil if they walked in theways of righteousness.

 THE DESERET NEWS.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.NO. 1. GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1863. VOL. XIII.REMARKSBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF. GreatSalt Lake City Bowery, June 12 1863.REPORTED BY G. D. WATT.Jesus said to those whom he had appointedto go forth and preach his Gospel; "Go yourway: behold, I send you forth as lambs amongwolves. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, norshoes: and salute no man by the way."— [##Luke 10:3-4##]Again, "And ye shall be brought before gov-enors and kings for my sake, for a testimonyagainst them and the Gentiles. But whenthey deliver you up, take no thought how orwhat you shall speak, for it shall be givenyou in that same hour what you shall speak.For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit ofyour Father which speaks in you." [##Matthew 10:18-20##]This is one of the blessings that belong tothe church and kingdom of God in this andin every other age of the world when God hashad a church upon the earth. When peopleattempt to preach the Gospel without the in-spiration of the Holy Ghost, they are underthe necessity of studying or of writing theirsermons, thus presenting the cogitations oftheir own hearts in support of the doctrinesand tenets of their particular sects. Whenthe Lord sets to his hand to perform a work,and to build up his kingdom on the earth, hisservants whom he calls to do this work areobliged to trust in the Lord their God and to lean upon his arm for strenth, for no mancan tell what the will of God is unless it isrevealed to him by the revelations of JesusChrist through the power of the Holy Ghost.This is the principle that has sustained theElders of Israel, in our own day, in all theirlabors among the nations to build up thiskingdom for the last time, and to preach theGospel in the ears of all people and nations.The servants of God in Zion, in all their coun-sels and deliberations for the promotion of holy and righteous principles, have to be con-stantly governed by it. Had it not been forthis principle, this congregation, gatheredfrom almost every nation under heaven,would not have been found here to-day; wemight have preached to them until dooms dayand we, of ourselves, by our own wisdom andability, could never have convinced them ofthe truth of the gospel the Lord has revealedin our day, for the gathering and salvation ofthe honest in heart, and for the establishmentof righthousness over the whole earth.Not only the men who bare record of thesethings had the testimony of Jesus Christ, butit also reached those who heard their wordsbearing record of the truth to every honesthearted person thoughout all the world forthe last thirty years. We cannot know thehearts of men, nor the will of God concerningnations, kingdoms, and people only as it isrevealed to us by the gift and power of theHoly Ghost. President Young reproves, cor-rects, gives revelation and teaches doctrineand principle, for the benefit of this peopleand mankind in general by the revelationswhich God gives to him. This principle in-spired the hearts of ancient prophets and ser-vants of God and sustained them in every try-ing scene, it has also been the comfort andsustaining power of the servants of God inthis last dispensation from the foundation of this kingdom to the present time. As theancient apostles were called so have themodern apostles and servants of God beencalled to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature, and the gift andpower of the Holy Ghost has sustained themwhen they were brought before kinds and ru-lers. The Savior preached and traveled, andsuffered until he gave up the ghost on Calva-ry; that same power sustained him under ev-ery circumstance, and made known unto himthe will of his Father. This is one amongthe many blessing which the Latter-DaySaints enjoy. God reveals unto us light andtruth and brings to our remembrance thingswhich are according to the will of God whichwe should teach. This is a great consolationto us, and to realize our position in the moun-tains. We have been led here by the gentle hand of God. No man could have foreseenwhat would happen to the nation of the Uni-ted States had it not been revealed to us inthe revelations which God gave to his proph-et Joseph Smith. The revelations concerningwhat shall transpire in the last days can beread in the Book of Mormon, Book of Doc-trine and Covenants, and in the Bible. "Sure-ly the Lod God will do nothing, but he re-vealeth his secret unto his servants the proph-ets." [##Amos 3:7##] When we were called upon to leaveour homes and our holy temple in Nauvoo, itwas a great trial to many. When we cameto this country as pioneers, we built the bridg-es, killed the snakes, and opened the way forthe emigration of saint and sinner, saying,it is all right; but we did not know how soonthe calamities that are now upon the nationwould break forth, yet we knew they would come soon. By what power did we influencethese men and women before me to leave theirhomes and their country to dwell in thesedistant wilds? They were influenced by theinspriations of the Almighty which always attends the preaching of the Gospel of JesusChrist in all ages. There was a spirit in them, and the inspiration of the Almightygave it understanding, and they were movedupon to listen to the advice that the servantsof God gave them, to gather to the place theLord had appointed to locate his people—This is the hand of God, and we should bethankful for this good land and for our homes.We here dwell in peace, and s[t]and in holyplaces, in a land which has been dedicated to God; and the power of righteousness prevailshere, and hence we have power to remainhere in peace. We remain here in peace be-cause righteousness and the power of Goddwell here. It is true the enemy of God andall the righteous, the devil, who goes aboutlike a roaring lion seeking whom he may de-vour, has sought our destruction from the be-ginning, and has stirred up the wicked to seekour overthrow; yet the Lord has preserved us;we should be thankful for this, and we shouldhonor God and worship him with undividedhearts, doing our duty constantly, and pursu-ing that course wherein we shall be justifiedbefore the Lord.No man can value sufficiently the life he now holds, and the place he now occupies inthis world, unless he is moved upon by theSpirit and power of God to enlighten his un-derstanding. What is the chief end of man?It, seemingly, is to get gold and fame, and thehonor that man bestows, to gratify their sen-sual propensitites and desires. Do the greatmass of mankind seek to honor and glorifyGod, seeking by every lawful means to bringtheir bodies into subjection to the law ofChrist? Do they understand that they arethe offspring of God, and are made after hisimage and likeness, and placed in this worldto pass through a short probation to preparethem to dwell eternally in the presence of the Father and the Son? Are not nine tenths ofthe human family more ready to blasphemethe name of God than to honor it? Wouldthey do this if they were in possession of theSpirit of God to magnify their calling andfulfill the object and end of their creation?—No. Every thing that God has made keepsthe law of its creation and honors it exceptman. I have always marveled at this. Man-kind, who are made after the image of God toanswer a high and noble purposes are the onlybeings in creation that will blaspheme hisname and set at naught his authority. Theyhave an agency, and the Spirit of God is of-fered to them as freely as the light of thesun, which shines on the just and on the un-just, if they would receive it. All the lightand intelligence man ever did or will have,has come through that principle and power,and in company with this, the Lord has rais-ed up men in our own generation, to whom hehas sent the administration of angels, andlaid on them the responsibility of bearing record to the gospel, with a promise to allnations, both Jew and Gentile, that, if theywill receive the testimony of his servantsthey shall receive the Holy Ghost who shallbear record unto them of the truth. Have thenations received the Gospel? Yes, one of afamily and two of a city, here and there one,and they are gathered together to stand inholy places and to build up the church andkingdom of God in the last days, to preparethe way for the coming of the Son of Man.—The mass of this generation have rejected theGospel; they have shed the blood of the Lord'sprophets and consented thereto, and havedriven from their midst those who bear thewords of eternal life. One of the most liber-al and free Governments under the heavenshas driven out from them the only people un-der the heavens that God acknowledges ashis church, because of the word of God andthe testimony of Jesus which they bear. Wehave been driven to the valleys of these moun-tains for our good; the hand of God has led ushere. Great affliction awaits the nation fromwhich we have been driven out, and the wick-ed nations of the Gentiles on this land and inforeign lands.We live in a momentous age, and our re-ponsibilies are great before the Lord, and tothis generation. We have borne record of thecalamities that should be poured out in thelast days and they are coming to pass. Forthus saith the Lord, "and after your testimo-ny cometh wrath and indignation upon thepeople; for after your testimony cometh thetestimony of earthquakes, that shall causegroanings in the midst of her, and men shallfall on the ground and not be able to stand,and also cometh the testimony of the voice ofthunderings, and the voice of lightnings, andthe voice of tempests, and the voice of thewaves of the sea, heaving themselves beyondtheir bounds. And all things shall be incommotion; and surely men's hearts shall failthem; for fear shall come upon all people; andangels shall fly through the midst of heaven,crying with a loud voice; sounding the trumpof God, saying, prepare ye, prepare ye, O in-habitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come: behold, and lo! the Bride-groom cometh, go yet out to meet him." [##Doctrine and Covenants 88:88-92##] Again,"I the Lord am angry with the wicked; I amholding my Spirit from the inhabitants of the earth. I have sworn in my wrath and de-creed wars upon the face of the earth, andthe wicked shall slay the wicked," [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:32-33##] etc.If a thousand prophets had proclaimed tothis nation what has come to pass since 1860to the present time, who would have believedthem? Not a man unless they possessed thespirit of revelation. What the prophet JosephSmith foretold thirty years ago is now cometo pass; and who can help it? Have the Lat-ter Day Saints been the cause of this dreadful war? No. While Joseph Smith was livingevery public and private calamity that hap-pened in the land was laid to his account. Itis not Joseph Smith or his brethren that doeththese things, but the Lord has laid his handon the nation. It is a consolation to theSaints when they contemplate upon what Godhas spoked through his servants which isnow being fulfilled before their eyes. Allthat has been spoken by ancient and modernprophets have had their fulfillment until now,and will have the scene is wound up.No man ever did or ever will obtain salva-tion only thorugh the ordinances of the gospel,and through the name of Jesus. There canbe no change in the gospel; all men that aresaved from Adam to in[fi]nitum are saved bythe one system of salvation. The Lord maygive many laws, and many commandments tosuit the varied circumstances and conditionsof his children throughout the world, such asgiving a law of carnal commandments toIsrael, but the laws and principles of thegospel do not change. If any portion of thisgeneration is saved it will be because theyreceive the gospel which Jesus Christ and hisapostles preached. When the Lord inspiresmen and sends them to any generation, heholds that generation responsible for themanner in which they receive the testimonyof his servants. He called upon us and weleft our occupation, to go forth in our weak-ness to preach his gospel; we had no power inand of ourselves to do this only as the Lordgave us strength by his Spirit; and we have sofar built up his kingdom upon this principle;we have been governed by this principle ofrevelation in all our public and private workswhich we have done for God. We shall buildour temple upon this principle, and carry outall the purposes of the Lord our God in thelatter days upon the same same principle and uponno other.The very moment that men undertake to move for God in their own way and uponthe principles of their own coining, they will failto accomplish that which they design. Theworld has tried this for generations. It is nowalmost universally acknowledged throughoutchristendom that no man is properly qualifiedto preach the gospel unless he has passedthrough a college, or some insitution of learn-ing to study the theology and get a knowledge ofGreek, Latin and Hebrew—of languages deadand living. Does this system of learningalone give power to administer salvation tomankind? Does it give evidence and bearwitness to the hearts of men by the power ofthe Holy Ghost and the revelations of JesusChrist? It does not. The disciples of Christanciently were illiterate men, yet they borerecord to the learned that God had sent themwith a message of salvation. Jesus Christ,whose life was a scene of affliction and sor-row, who apparently had arose from the lowergrades of society, was eminently endowedwith the spirit and power of revelation fromhis Father, and bore record of his works toJew and Gentile under its influence and power.The servants of God in every age havealways been govered by the same power; andwe must build up the kingdom of God by it ornot at all. We look to him for guidance inwhat we shall do from day to day; we havebeen guided in this way hitherto and shall beso guided unto the end.I thank God that we have embraced agospel that has power in it; that we have thetrue organization of the church and kingdomof God, with its Apostles, Prophets, Pastorsand Teachers, gifts, graces and blessings forthe work of the ministry and the edifying ofthe body of Christ. The moment any of thehelps, governments, gifts and powers are doneaway from the church militant, schism iscreated in the body and it no longer can co-operate with the church triumphant in heavenagainst the power of the devil and wickedmen. We cannot build up the kingdom ofGod in our day and overcome the powers ofevil which prevail over the world withoutinspired prophets and apostles, gifts, powersand blessings, any more than they could inthe days of Jesus and his apostles. We havethis church organization and the power whichattended it in ancient days, and we seek con-stantly the welfare of the children of men.We have a great work laid upon us, and weare responsible to God for the manner inwhich we make use of these blessings. TheLord requires of us to build up Zion, to gatherthe honest in heart, restore Israel to theirblessings, redeem the earth from the power ofthe devil, establish universal peace and pre-pare a kingdom and a people for the comingand reign of the Messiah. When we do allwe can to forward and accomplish this workthen are we justified. This is the work of ourlives, and it makes life of some consequenceto us. When men are destitute of the Spiritof God they do not prize life only to indulgethe cravings of unenlightened and pervertedhuman nature; they cross each other's in-terests, become filled with the spirit of wrathand indignation, and thirst for and shed theblood of each other. Would they do this ifthey were inspired by the spirit and power ofGod? No. That which is good is of God, andthat which is evil emanates from the devil.The Lord permits judgments to come upon the wicked, but he never sends a great calam-ity upon the world without first sendingprophets and inspired men to warn the wickedof approaching chastisement, giving them, atthe same time, space for repentence andmeans of escape, as witness the time of Noah,Lot, etc. And, "as it was in the days ofNoah so shall it be in the days of the comingof the Son of Man." [##Matthew 24:37##] When the messengersof God have given a faithful warning to thewicked of their approaching overthrow, andthe testimony is sealed, then will the Lordcome out of his hiding place and vex themwith a sore vexation. All that the Saviorsaid should come upon the wicked Jews wasliterally fulfilled, and his blood is now uponthem and their children. The hand of Godhas been zealous in holding the Jews underthe ro[d] until this day. Why? Because theyrejected the testimony of the Son of God, andhis gospel. That is the cause of the greattrouble to-day that is vexing this nation andother nations in the old world. You may putall the judgments of God together that hasbefalled the nations and tribes of men fromthe beginning, and the afflictions they sufferedare no greater than are now ready to be poured out upon the gentile world.John the revelator saw this day. He sawalso "an Angel of God fly in the midst ofheaven having the everlasting gospel to preachunto them that dwell on the earth, and toevery nations, and kindred, and tongue, andpeople, saying with a loud voice, Fear God,and give glory to him; for the hour of hisjudgement is come; and worship him that madeheaven, and earth, and the sea, and the foun-tains of waters." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] That angel has deliveredhis message and thousands of Elders of thischurch have been called to this ministry; ithas been laid upon our shoulders. I havetraveled more than a hundred thousand milesin the last thirty years to preach this gospel,and many thousands of it with my napsackupon my back, and without purse or scrip,begging my bread from door to door to preachthe gospel to my own nation. Thirty yearsago it was said unto us. You hear of wa[r]s inforeign countries, but you do not know thehearts of men in your own land, for you shallsoon have greater wars in your own land, etc.How is it my friends, is there trouble in the eastern countries? What means this crowd-ing of our streets with emigrants to the west?The Lord God has spoken through hisprophet; his words have been recorded, and heis backing up the testimony of his servants isfulfillment of his word; and the end is not yet.War and distress of nations has only justcommenced, and famine and pestilence willfollow on the heels of war, and there will begreat mourning, and weeping, and lamenta-tions in the land, and no power can stay thework of desolation and utter overthrow of thewicked.More than twenty-five years ago I wrote arevelation which Joseph Smith gave, whereinhe said that the rebellion should commence at South Carolina and from that war shouldspread through this nation and continue tospread until war should be poured out uponall nations, and great calamity and distruc-tion should await them.I published the book of Doctrine and Cov-enants in England in 1845 and since thattime it has been published in many differentlanguages, and thus we are sending the revela-tions which Jesus Christ has given to his peo-ple in the last days to the different nationsand tongues, that they may be left without an excuse. We know these things are coming,and because of them we are here in Utah, andthe devil and the wicked do not like it. Everyevil principle and power is opposed to us andour testimony. Do we not desire to do all mengood? We do; and in proof of this I only needsay that we have labored for many years inpoverty and hardships to carry salvation to the nations. Some of the European nationshave closed their doors against us, andin some of those nations we have preachedthe gospel and gathered out many souls, andthousands more will yet come like clouds andlike doves to the windows to join with us inthe enjoyment of the great blessings whichthe kingdom of God offers to all people.The highest object of man in this life should 
 tions the general outline of work pro-posed for the season; and you will beaided in doing this, by reference to theconference lectures. The President and his Counselors, constituting the pro-gramme committee, should be preparedat the first meeting to announce ap-pointments for the next, so that no un-necessary delay may occur. As a basisfor the earlier programmes, we suggestthat you draw from the subjective Scrip-tural headings, published in the ninthvolume of THE CONTRIBUTOR. In the November number of the Magazine, subjective titles to Doctrinal, Historical, Scientific and other subjects will begiven, from which you will make assign-ments for brief lectures to be delivered in your regular meetings.We wish to impress upon you the im-portance of thorough organization and mutual effort, not only for the improve-ment of those who voluntarily join with you, but for the reformation of those who are indifferent. This is your mis-sion; to look after the young men of your respective wards: and we wish it understood that the counsel of thePriesthood is that every young man in Zion should join and take part in theseAssociations. You will please see that this message is delivered to as many as possible. We hope that you will makethe influence of the Associations felt this season, more than heretofore, in the saving of the wayward. As officers,you should feel an anxiety for the refor-mation of such, and be found extendingthe helping hand. The Associations are also appealed to, to improve the tone of our social parties, and to popularize the observance of counsel as to the regula-tions to be observed in them.There is a great deal of lightminded-ness and idle conversation indulged inby our young men, which you can do much to correct. Place the books of theMutual Improvement Association Course o[f] Reading in the hands of as many of the young men as you can get to takethem, and encourage conversation uponthe subjects they treat of. Especially we would advise that you do not neglect the crowds of young men and boys, who loiter upon the streets or congregate about the stores, the sunny sides of the meeting houses, barns and other placesin the winter, and indulge in levity and vulgar conversation. Try and break up such gatherings, by persistently leadinginto habits of reading, as many of their number as you can influence. This Course of Reading, which we have adopted, is designed to help you in the work of interesting and saving the young.  It should be taken up by every officer and member and pursued faithfully to the end. You can make this a greatsuccess; but it will depend upon your interest in it, as manifested by your energy in advocating and example in pursuing it. If you do not take thesebooks and read them you cannot expect others to. We desire your prompt and cheerful assistance to introduce this Course of Reading, and rely upon your support to maintain it.We realize that the matters involve the employment of your time andmeans; but if you, the representativeyoung men of Zion, are not interested in them, how do you expect that Zion will be established? Our testimony is, that the time has come for the young men of Israel to give serious attention to the reformation of their lives, and to the improvement of their minds. The Lord requires this, and as His servants,we enjoin it upon you. We shall watch with deep interest the work of the Associations, during the coming season, and shall take occasion to promote it, by our counsel, as opportunity is presented.  Be energetic and faithful and the Lordwill be with you. We shall pray foryou continually that you may be pros-pered and blessed, in the name of Jesus.Your Brethren and Fellow Laborers,Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F.

 ADDRESS OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTEN-DENCY.To the officers and members of the YoungMen's Mutual Improvement Associa-tions throughout Zion:DEAR BRETHREN—While regretting theexistence of circumstances depriving usof the satisfaction and pleasure of ming-ling personally with you, in your general conference gathering, we are delightedwith the privilege of addressing you inwriting.Our hearts are full of gratitude to ourheavenly Father, and we rejoice exceed-ingly in the blessings of life and libertyso abundantly bestowed upon the youthof Zion. Upon you, dear young breth-ren, the hope of Israel largely rests. Be 
 General Superintendent Wilford Wood-ruff addressed the conference in sub-stance as follows:I have been suffering for some days with a cold, which almost disables mefrom public speaking, yet I will try to make a few remarks upon this import-ant occasion.  In my view there neverbefore was a time when all the powers of heaven, earth and hell were workingin their respective spheres as they are now for the advancement of the pur-poses of God. The Lord has labored from the creation to lead men to do goodand to obey such laws as would result in good to mankind. Whatever leads togood, we are told, is of God, and what-ever leads to evil is of an opposite source.As a people we understand somewhatthe nature of the warfare necessary inthe carrying on of this work. We can-not expect any less opposition than hasbeen shown to the work of God in past ages. There has always seemed to be a determination on the part of the powersof darkness to frustrate the purposes of God. This has been especially the case in this age. We know that God has again revealed His will and establishedHis kingdom. John the Revelator fore-told the flying of an angel through the midst of heaven having the everlastinggospel. Many declarations of Scrip-ture point to the restoration of the gos-pel in these the last days.We have gathered in these valleys,perhaps a hundred and seventy-five thousand Saints from all parts of theworld, and from various occupations.The weak things of the world have beenchosen to bear the Priesthood, and tes-tify to the restoration of the gospel.Those who have listened to and obeyedtheir message have received the Holy Ghost, and have been led to gather. If this message had not been from God, the people who embraced it would nothave gathered, and Utah would have still been a barren desert. Since theSaints gathered they have had the same trials and temptations which the Saints in all ages have had to contend with. The hosts of evil spirits who were castdown out of heaven, are warring againstthe Saints and all good men.We have different organizations of our youth for their proper spiritual train-ing. There are the Primaries, where the little children are taught the truthsof the gospel; also the Sabbath schools,which embrace sixty thousand children.Thank God there are so many. From these the youth progress and becomemembers of the Mutual ImprovementAssociations.I regard the work awaiting the youthof this people as equal in importance to that which ever lay before a class ofyoung men and women on earth. Itrests upon them to take the Kingdom ofGod and bear it forth; to stand in the midst of the judgments which are com-ing upon the earth. I regard the pres-ent generation as lying in as deep dark-ness as any that ever lived upon the earth. A thousand murders are com-mitted now where there was one, seventyor eighty years ago.The Kingdom of God, its keys andPriesthood, are here; and I want to say 
 To the Young Men's Mutual ImprovementAssociations:BELOVED BRETHREN: I have beenrequested to give a brief outline of mylife and association with the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Inorder for me to comply with such a re-quest my communication must of neces-sity be exceedingly brief, to be suit-able for an article in a magazine likethe CONTRIBUTOR.I was born March 1st, 1807. Myfather's name was Aphek Woodruff. Mymother's name was Beulah Thompson.She had three sons; Azmon, bornNovember 29th, 1802; Ozem Thompson,born December 22nd, 1804; Wilford, bornMarch 1st, 1807. All three are living atthis date;* Azmon, at my farm house inFarmer's Ward; Ozem Thompson, atDaysville, Oswego County, New York;but he is nearly blind. I am still livingin Salt Lake City. My mother died June11th, 1808, at Avon, Connecticut, agedtwenty-six years, leaving me fifteenmonths old. My father was a miller, aswas also his father before him, whichoccupation I followed until 1832.At an early age my mind was exercisedupon religion, although I did not makeany profession thereof until 1830. I didnot then join any church, for the reasonthat I could not find any denominationwhose teachings, faith and practiceagreed with the ordinances and gifts ofthe Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught byHim in His day and time. Although theministers of the day taught that thefaith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordi-nances which the ancient Saints enjoyedwere done away and were no longerneeded, I did not believe it to be true,only as they were done away through the unbelief of the children of men. Ibelieved the same gifts, graces, miraclesand power would be manifest in one ageof the world as in another, when Godhad a Church upon the earth, and apeople who would obey His ordinancesas in ancient days. I believed theChurch of God would be re-establishedupon the earth, and that I should live tosee it. These principles were riveted upon my mind, from the perusal of theOld and New Testament, and with fer-vent prayer that the Lord would show me what was right and what was wrong,and lead me in the path of salvationwithout any regard to the opinions ofmen.The whisperings of the Spirit ofthe Lord for a space of three yearstaught me that the Lord was about toset up His Church and Kingdom in theearth, in the last days, in fulfilment ofpromises made by ancient prophets andapostles who spoke as they were movedupon by the inspiration of AlmightyGod. While in this state of mind I wentwith my brother Azmon to Richland, Oswego County, New York. We boughta farm and commenced business. InDecember, 1833, two Mormon Elders,viz. Zera Pulsipher and Elijah Cheney,came into our town and stopped at ourhouse. Elder Pulsipher said he wascommanded by the Spirit of the Lord togo into the north country, and he andElder Cheney had walked from Fabinsvia Syracuse, near sixty miles throughdeep snows, and our house was the firstplace he felt impelled to stop at. Heappointed a meeting at the schoolhousewhich I attended, and on hearing himpreach I felt that his sermon was the firstgospel sermon I had ever heard in mylife. I invited these Elders home andspent the night in conversation and inreading the Book of Mormon. I wasthoroughly convinced it was a true rec-ord of the word of God. My brotherAzmon and myself offered ourselves forbaptism, and on the thirty-first day ofDecember, 1833, Elder Pulsipher wentwith us to the creek and baptized us,with two other persons, we being thefirst baptized in Oswego County; eight*Since this paper was written, my brotherAzmon, departed this life, at my farm house, onMonday, the fourteenth of January, 1889, at10:26 o'clock p.m., aged eighty-six years, onemonth and fifteen days. The funeral serviceswere held at the Farmer's Ward Meeting House,at 11 o'clock a.m., Wednesday, January 16th,after which, his mortal remains were consignedto the tomb.—W. W. 
 ye, therefore, worthy of your holy call-ing. Trust in the Lord of Hosts, giveyour hearts to God, and fail not in yourmission of Improvement. Be watchful,prayerful, obedient; for the eyes ofheavenly hosts are upon you. Honoryour parents, that your days may bemany. Venerate those grown gray inthe service of the God of heaven andearth, and the ordinances of the Gospelshall be your portion, the salvation ofGod your part, and the Holy Priesthoodwith the powers thereof your inherit-ance. A great work is before you.Thrust in your sickles and reap, for theharvest is ripe, though laborers are few.Be not satisfied, rest not content untilevery young man professing the name ofSaint in Zion is enrolled in the cause ofMutual Improvement.Civilization, so called, with a tide ofevil and corrupting influences is sweep-ing the land with temptations calculatedto lead the young into paths of vice anddestruction. These must be resistedand overcome, because at war with peaceand purity. Be ye lovers of men ratherthan lovers of pleasure. Using wiselythe gifts and graces with which the Al-mighty has endowed you, rescue fromthe allurements of saloons, beer hallsand other haunts of vice, those whomGod has designed should move on ahigher and purer moral plane.Human redemption, from the effectsof the fall, is the grandest work in whichGod and man can be engaged. Thosewho would be successfully employed init must secure the testimony of the HolySpirit, make virtue the jewel of the soul,purity of thought the guide of the heart,and honor, integrity and truth com-panions of daily life.Conforming your exercises to the or-ganizations of the Church, let all yourteachings harmonize therewith; so shallall your works, under the proper use ofthe Priesthood which you bear, besanctified to the honor and glory of God.The general authorities of the Churchand those of the Wards and Stakesthroughout Zion will give you encourage-ment and help whenever and whereverneeded.Half-yearly conferences of the variousYoung Men's Mutual Improvement As-sociations may be held in the Stakesthroughout Zion at such times and placesas may be determined by the StakePresidency and Superintendency of theAssociations. These conferences mayoccupy two days, including one Sunday,and should be made occasions for re-ceiving reports and giving mutual in-structions that will tend to harmonize themanner of conducting the Associationsand achieving the most satisfactory re-sults.A general conference of the Associa-tions will be held about the first of June,1888, and annually thereafter, the exactdate and place to be hereafter named bythe General Superintendency. TheAssociations should endeavor to con-tinue their regular weekly meetingsuntil about the time of the Annual Con-ference, before taking their summer va-cation. At the general conference statis-tical and other necessary reports will berequired and time given for the consid-eration of the best means and methods ofpromoting the education and welfare ofthe young men and women of Zion.The Primary and Sunday Schoolorganizations, Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations, and Relief Societies have beeninstituted for a wise purpose. They are"helps and governments" calculated intheir nature and design to accomplishmuch good among Saints. Each hasa special field of usefulness not occupiedby the others, and no man in this Church,filled with the Holy Ghost, will lay astraw in the way of either of them.Neither will he find occasion for manifes-tations of petty jealousies, by which tofoster one at the expense of another.The Sunday Schools have graduallyand almost universally come to occupythe forenoon of each Sabbath. Havethe interests of God's Church or thewelfare of His people suffered thereby?Certainly not. What, indeed, is of morevital importance to us than the properreligious training of our children? Whatthe Primary Associations begin, let theSunday Schools and Mutual Improve-ment Associations continue. Each has 
 EPISTLE OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCY.To the Officers and Members of theYoung Men's Mutual ImprovementAssociations throughout Zion.DEAR BRETHREN: Once more, throughthe blessings of the Lord, we are per-mitted to address you in writing; and, indoing so, we rejoice greatly in the bles-sings of life and liberty with which youare so abundantly surrounded on thisauspicious occasion. An appropriatetime has been chosen on which to holdyour first General Annual Conference,for it is eminently befitting that theyoung men of Israel should thus honorthe illustrious statesmen, colonizer andProphet Brigham Young, by holdingtheir conference meetings on a day sonear the anniversary of his birth. Hewas inspired to organize the Mutual Im-provement Associations throughout Zion.With delight you can revere his memory;for distrust of the young men of Israel never marred his great mind. In themhe had unbounded confidence, and forthem unlimited love. The Almightyendowed him with the faculty of readingmen more accurately and more thorough-ly than most people read books. Thestudy of human hearts and the analyses of human minds enabled him to distin-guish between the good and the bad. Bythe inspiration of the Holy Spirit fraudsstood rebuked, while sincere rejoicedin his presence, and were comforted byhis love. Noting the yearly harvestof death, and comprehending as fewmen comprehend the magnitude of thegreat work in which we are engaged, hefully sensed the responsibility that mustultimately rest upon you in bearing to avictorious consummation the Church andKingdom of God.The manner in which you have respond-ed to his confidence and esteem hasproduced the bloom preceding thegrowth and ripening of glorious fruit.Following in his counsels you will notdisappoint his anticipations, for you arebuilding upon a foundation resting uponeternal principles. Continue faithful tothe covenants made with the Lord andeach other; give your hearts to God, andlistening ears to the counsels of His HolyPriesthood, and when the storms beatupon you and the house you are buildingneither shall fall.As your friends and brethren, we mustearnestly beseech you to avoid the snaresof worldly ambition. Enter not the gatesof pride, within which selfishness weavesnets to bind the soul. Write upon themthe words inscribed over Dante's Inferno—"Abandon hope all who enter here."Thirst for the honors and praises of menand undue love for the things of thisworld are dangerous reefs, upon whichmany have wrecked their hopes of eter-nal life. Pride, wearing the garb of hu-mility, often prays devoutly, preacheseloquently; but dwellers in heaven areas little children, of whom the youth ofZion should be as an advanced class—beautiful type of saintly humility andunsuspicious innocence.Haughty pride, insolent assumptionand over-reaching ambition come of himwho wrought rebellion in heaven, sowedstrife on earth, and trailed the serpentthrough human hearts. Mocking infidel-ity, atheistic boasts and sneering skep-ticism are products of a power that reignsin hell, because it would not serve inheaven. Light and life, peace and puri-ty, humility and homage, goodness andgrace, come of God. Misery andmourning, pride and presumption, dark-ness and death, come of Satan. Betweenthem, young men of Zion, you havechosen well. Henceforth serve him whomade you, and heaven's light shall guide 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.JUNIUS F. WELLS, EDITOR.PUBLISHED BY THE CONTRIBUTOR COMPANY.Terms: Two Dollars a Year, in advance.SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL, 1887.EPISTLE.To the Young Men of Israel:BELOVED Brethren in the New andEverlasting Covenant: This being mybirthday, I having first seen the light ofday on Sunday, at ten o'clock, on themorning of the first day of March, 1807,making me eighty years of age this day, andalso having the honor of being appointedby the Presidency of the Church as Super-intendent of the Young Men's MutualImprovement Associations throughoutthese mountatins of Israel—in view ofthese circumstances, I feel that I am authorized to give my brethren, the young men of Israel, some counsel andinstruction. But I cannot satisfy my ownmind without the inspiration of the Lord.I have been a member of the Churchover fifty-three years. I held the officeof a Teacher one year, the office of aPriest one year; the office of an Elderone year; the office of a Seventy twoyears; and have held the office of anApostle forty-eight years. I do notspeak of this boastingly, for when theLord chose me for an Apostle, onepassage of scripture was certainly ful-filled—He chose one of the weak thingsof the world.I have traveled in the ministry during this time, 145,000 miles, through England,Scotland, Wales, six islands of the sea,twenty-three of the United States, andfive Territories, including the RockyMountains. I have crossed the AtlanticOcean four times, have held 4191 meet-ings, and preached 3250 discourses.Through my instrumentality the Lordadded to the Church in 1840, in thesouth of England, one thousand eighthundred souls, in eight months' labors,among whom were nearly two hundredpreachers of the various sects. Fiftyof the preachers belonged to the UnitedBrethren, who had broken off from theWesleyan Methodists. This society ofUnited Brethren numbered six hundred,all of whom were baptized, except oneperson. I baptized one thousand ofthese one thousand eight hundred. Theothers were baptized by Priests and Elders whom I had ordained.In my travels I have establishedseventy-seven preaching places, organ-ized fifty-one branches of the Church,confirmed 3343 members of the Church,ordained one Apostle, and united inordaining eight others. I have ordainedtwenty-three Patriarchs, and assisted inordaining eighty-four others. I have ordained ninety-three High Priests. Ihave ordained twenty-four High Coun-cilors, and assisted in ordaining seventy-four others. I have ordained fifty-sevenSeventies, and six hundred and sixty-seven Elders, and assisted in ordainingfour thousand three hundred and forty-seven Elders. I have ordained twenty-three Bishops and seventeen counselorsto Bishops. I have ordained four hun-dred and forty-six Priests, sixty-sixTeachers, and fifteen Deacons. I haveset apart and blessed one thousand andthirty-four missionaries and assisted in setting apart four thousand five hundredand twelve other missionaries. I haveblessed several hundred children. I haveadministed to one thousand one hun-dred and fifty sick persons by the layingon of hands and anointing with oil;rebuking diseases and evil spirits in thename of Jesus Christ; and many havebeen healed by the power of God, devilshave been cast out, the dumb caused tospeak, the deaf to hear and the lame towalk, and the sick have been raised upby the power of God and not of man.I have kept a daily journal for fifty-three years, and reported many of Joseph Smith's sermons and prophecies,also many sermons of the Apostles andElders, and kept a general account ofevents as they have occurred around me.Through the blessing of God I have hadthe privilege of baptizing my father,step-mother, and only sister, with many 
 To the Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.:DEAR BRETHREN: We have on handover one thousand sets of the M.I.A.First Year's Course of Reading, anddesire your co-operation in placing them,as soon as possible, in the hands of themembers of our Associations, with nec-essary instructions as to their proper use.The set of books, consist of the follow-ing:I. The Gospel, by B. H. Roberts;II. The First Book of Nature, by J. E.Talmage;III. The History of England, by Chas.Dickens;IV. The Life of Nephi, by Geo. Q.Cannon;V. Readings from Washington Irving;These books we consider extremely valu-able to our young men; and the habit ofsystematic reading, which they are ex-pected to introduce, will be of the ut-most benefit to all who engage in it.We have appointed Elder Milton H.Hardy to represent us, in presenting themerits of the Course of Reading to you,in connection with other instructions per-taining to the work of mutual improve-ment; and we trust you will cheerfullyassist him in his labors, so that all thesebooks may be put into the hands ofreaders, during the present season; andthe young men, for whom they were pre-pared, made the recipients of the greatbenefits that are sure to follow theircareful perusal.Your brethren,(Signed)Wilford Woodruff,Jos. F. Smith,Moses Thatcher,General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A.Nov. 14, 1890. 
 your feet in the path of purity, leadingto the gate of perfection.From mountain heights pause ye now,and gaze upon the world's magnificence,pride and pomp; then trace the gleamsof light along the way in which faithfulElders, prayerfully and earnestly, followthe lowly Nazarene to realms of heaven-ly glory. Note carefully the faith bywhich they endure earthly tribulations, in order to gain heavenly crowns. Pa-tiently and faithfully do they bear theirmessage amid the scorn of mockingmobs. Over lands and over seas theycarry the Gospel, seeking not to savetheir lives lest they lose them. Takingno heed of the morrow, they travelwithout purse or scrip, trusting in God,and receiving, as did their Master, thecontempt of the world. What shall betheir reward? Peace here, exaltationhereafter! Ministers of Christ here, ru-ling princes and reigning kings hereafter!Lives eternal shall be their reward; forthus do they come to know God the Fa-ther and Jesus whom He hath sent.In the midst of trials of tribulations,while deathless woe oppresses theheart, mothers may forget their nursingbabes, but He who notes the sparrow'sfall, will not forget His covenant chil-dren, though in infinite wisdom, as a testof faith, He permits pride to mock andinsolence to deride, while persecutiongrinds and kills; but death and the gravewill be conquered, when the King ofGlory wins the ultimate victory atthe very gates of hell. Down into itsbowels did He descend, thence led cap-tivity captive, and gave gifts to men.Alone, while treading the wine-pressof the wrath of devils and men, gainedHe the keys of death, hell and the grave.They were forged in the crucible of in-tense hate, not in the lap of luxuriousease. Ingratitude heaped upon Him thesins of the world, and heavy-eyed watch-men slept while he prayed and sweat great gouts of blood. Malice spat in hisface; Jealousy in mockery crowned himwith thorns; Envy mantled him with acast-off robe; Cruelty nailed Him to the cross, then cried: "Come down, savethyself." Son of God, Prince of Power,commander of heavenly legions thoughHe was, the anguish of accumulatedwoes, caused Him, as death's agonybathed his brow, to exclaim: "My God,my God, why has thou forsaken me?"Ye sons of Zion, think of this, andbear patiently the mocking scorn of un-belief. Taunting skepticism may derideyour faith while sneeringly laughing atyour confidence in God. But rememberthat the power to bear humiliation isthe test of humility. "There must needsbe offences, but woe unto them by whomthey come!" The exiled and imprisonedmay bear contempt; and while earthlypowers hold high carnival and mock atsacred things, the promises of God mayseem to fail; but you who are wise willknow that the methods of Satan havenever changed. Pride, haughtiness, re-bellion, oppression, deceit, rule and ruinhave ever been characteristic of the fallenson of the morning. On the mountaintop he offered the Christ of God thekingdoms of this world as the price offalse worship. Treachery lurked deepwhen he sought to kill by tempting theLord to cast Himself down from the Temple pinnacle; then sneeringly askedthat bread be made of stones to satisfyhunger gnawing at famishing vitals. Asthen, so now—Who lives godly in JesusChrist shall suffer persecution. 'Tis theheritage of Saints. As they hated theMaster, so will they hate His servants.Be not surprised, therefore, if for a time,humiliation, contempt and scorn be yourpart; for even while the hand of Godtraced on the palace wall the doom ofthe mocking king, the proud in drunkenrevel defiled the sacred cups of theTemple; but how quickly followed thefall! Boasting Assyrian hosts, declaringthere was no God, reveled in sight ofthe walls of Jerusalem; but the angel ofdeath passed over and wrapt them indreamless sleep, that knew no mortalwakening.Profit by these lessons of sacred his-tory; trust the Lord, and place honor andtruth above the price of gold, and earth-ly tribulations shall polish jewels thatGod will set in frames of endless joy.Permit not the illusive interests of this 
 to my young brethren who are present: Lead your fellows from that which is evil, and lay aside everything which corrupts either mind or body. No mancan inherit a kingdom of glory withoutabiding the law of that kingdom, and we are all aiming, or should be, for a celestial kingdom.Nine out of ten of the young mis-sionaries now being sent abroad, arechosen from the Mutual ImprovementAssociations. The members of these organizations are preparing themselvesfor the ministry. In company with someof my brethren, I have the honor to be associated with these institutions, but I have not much time to spend with them.In 1844 about seven thousand persons were baptized in England; but now the labors of our missionaries are like gath-ering grapes after the vintage is done. If an Elder, during a mission of twoor three years, baptizes half a dozenor a dozen persons, he thinks he hasdone a good work; and he has.Young men, leave grog shops alone;avoid everything that is evil; remember that you have a law to obey and never break it. Keep the law of purity and chastity.I pray God to help you to comprehendyour positions, duties and labors. I amsometimes asked why does not God preserve His Saints from persecution andtemptation? God has His own way to deal with men. In no age has He keptHis people from contact with persecu-tion and temptation. We have to meet these things; therefore prepare your-selves for them.I ask God to bless you all, to guideyou and preserve you, in the name ofJesus. Amen. 
 others were soon added to our numbers,and on the second of January, 1834,Elder Pulsipher organized a branch ofthe Church with twelve members, andordained my brother Azmon and NoahHolten Elders, and myself a Teacher.This was the commencement of my asso-ciation with the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints.From that day I have closely associatedwith the leaders of the Church in all theirhistory, until the present day. I traveledwith Joseph Smith and company knownas Zion's Camp, from Kirtland to ClayCounty, Missouri, upwards of one thous-and miles. I wrote a good portion ofthe history of that important event.The experience gained in traveling withthe Prophet of God in the company of twohundred and five, mostly young men,was of great benefit to those who weredisposed to make a right use of theirexperience. On my arrival in ClayCounty I took up my abode at LymanWight's, with Tilton Hyde, MiltonHolmes, Judge Elias Higbee and someof the Whitmers. I attended the meet-tings of the Prophet Joseph while he wasin Clay County, organizing the Presi-dency of that Stake of Zion and appoint-ing David Whitmer as President.I was still holding the office of a Teach-er, and knowing for myself that the ful-ness of the Gospel of Christ, which Godhad revealed to Joseph Smith, was true,I had a great desire to preach it to theinhabitants of the earth, but as a TeacherI had no authority to preach the gospelto the world. I went into the forestnear Lyman Wight's, one Sunday evening,aside from the abodes of men, and mademy desire known unto the Lord. Iprayed that the Lord would open myway and give me the privilege of preach-ing the gospel. I did not make my re-quest expecting any honor from man, forI knew that the preaching of the gospelwas attended with hard labor and per-secution. While I was praying, thespirit of the Lord rested upon me, andtestified to me that my prayer was heard,and that my request would be granted.I arose to my feet and walked some threehundred yards into a broad road rejoic-ing. As I came into the road I saw JudgeElias Higbee standing before me. AsI walked up to him he said, "Wilford,the Lord has revealed to me that it isyour duty to go into the vineyard of theLord and preach the gospel." I told himif that was the will of the Lord I wasready to go. I did not tell him that Ihad been praying for that privilege. Ihad been boarding at Lyman Wight'swith Judge Higbee for months and itwas the first time he had ever namedsuch a thing to me.At a meeting of the High Council atLyman Wight's, Clay County, Missouri,November 5th, 1834, I was ordained aPriest, by Elder Simeon Carter and BishopEdward Partridge appointed ElderHenry Brown and myself a mission tothe Southern States. On the thirteenthof January 1835, I received an honorabledischarge from Lyman Wight, as having performed my duties faithfully in Zion'sCamp, and Elder Henry Brown andmyself started upon our mission. Wecrossed into Jackson County and bowedour knees upon that land and returnedthanks to the Lord, prayed for His pro-tection from the hands of wicked menand mobs, and went on our way re-joicing. I started upon this my firstmission in life without purse or scripto preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ.We traveled through Jackson County,living mostly upon parched corn untilwe got out of the county. We spentone night with Mr. Jerew, the Indiantrader, on the Osage river. The nextday we walked sixty miles and lay onthe floor of a house without anything toeat, and walked next morning twelve milesbefore getting breakfast, makingseventy-two miles travel without food.We passed into Arkansas Territory andspent several weeks at Petty John Creek,where we passed through a very singu-lar experience with Mr. Alexander Ake-man and others, -[a full statement ofwhich is published in the eighteenthnumber of Vol. eight of the DeseretNews.]- We cut down a cottonwoodtree, and in two days dug out a canoefour feet wide and twelve feet long, androwed down the Arkansas river one 
 its mission and special field, upon whichno servant of God humbly trying to dohis duty will seek to encroach.THE CONTRIBUTOR, as the organ ofthe Mutual Improvement Associations, isa medium of instruction and enlighten-ment. How, except by judicious exer-cises of the faculties shall we developthe talent with which the Creator mayhave endowed us? Few things, if any,are calculated to strengthen the mind andgive it powers of concentration more thanthe frequent use of the pen, in writingfor publication. And what agency ismore potent for good than the press?THE CONTRIBUTOR, whose articles arelargely furnished by home authors, is amagazine of which all Israel have reasonto be proud. Its circulation should bewidely extended, and to this end we in-vite the co-operation of all Saints. Theeditor, Brother Junius F. Wells, has beensingularly blessed in his managementof the magazine heretofore. His selec-tion and arrangement of matter havebeen remarkably fortunate, and the Lordhas been with him in his responsiblelabors.But, notwithstanding the degree of ex-cellence reached, it should be our con-stant effort to improve, and the youngmen and women of talent among us cando great service in this direction, by fur-nishing regular contributions to themagazine. To this desirable end wevery respectfully invite their hearty co-operation.Libraries and reading rooms shouldbe established throughout Zion, andlectures on various subjects should beencouraged. Thus may you becomeacquainted with the customs, laws andlanguage of various countries, whileseeking to graduate in the science of allother sciences—correct theology. Inthis connection we would suggest that itwill be well in all the Stakes for theAssociations to take the initiative in es-tablishing libraries and reading rooms.This is a labor peculiarly adapted to ourorganization and has been enjoined uponus from the beginning. We deprecateany disposition on the part of our youngmen, especially those who have hadsuperior opportunities for acquiring aneducation, to draw away from the Im-provement Associations, and to formamong themselves separate societies ofan exclusive nature. Would it not bebetter if they would lend their talent and efforts to make the Improvement Associ-ations more successful? There is noworthy object they can desire to attainthat the Improvement Associations donot contemplate and hope to reach. We,therefore, ask the co-operation of all suchyoung men, and trust that it will be gladlygiven, as we feel sure the results of aunited endeavor under proper organiza-tion and direction will be most satisfac-tory.In all your struggles in acquiringknowledge seek wisdom. In all yourefforts to improve seek to know God andJesus, whom He hath sent, for in thatknowledge is found life eternal. TheHoly Priesthood that you bear is the keyto unlock that door. See that you donot misuse it and thereby fail. "Askand ye shall receive. Knock and it shallopen."On returning home from this confer-ence, we trust that you will carry with you the Spirit thereof and reneweddetermination to labor diligently andearnestly for improvement in the interestof purity and holiness. Rememberingalways the reason for the hope withinyou, make the love of God and of yourfellows the foundation of your work; andmoving forward steadily and prayerfullyand earnestly, you cannot fail in accom-plishing that which brings peace, happi-ness and salvation.Praying that the Lord may bless, pre-serve, guide and prosper you in all yourworks of love, we remain,Your fellow-laborers in the cause ofMutual Improvement.Wilford Woodruff,Jos. F. Smith, Moses Thatcher. 
 CIRCULAR.To the Officers of the Y[.]M.M.I.A.:DEAR BRETHREN. We desire to re-mind you that the time for resuming regular weekly meetings of the Associa-tions has about arrived, and to urge the officers to call the members of their associations together early in October.For the coming season we suggest andrecommend that the following subjects constitute an important part of your regular work. 
 other relatives, into the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints. I have alsoheld the keys of the dead of my father'shouse, and, through the mercy of Godand the assistance of my friends, I have been enabled to redeem somethree thousand souls of the Woodruff,Hart and Thompson families, through the ordinances for the dead, for which I feel to praise the Lord. For as Paulsays: Why are you baptized for thedead, if the dead rise not at all?Thus I have given you a few extractsfrom my journal, which is only a limitedaccount of the labors of one man out of thirty Apostles, one hundred and fiftyPatriarchs, some five hundred HighPriests, five thousand Seventies andtwenty thousand Elders, besides theLesser Priesthood, and two hundredthousand members of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now,with these reflections resting upon mymind, and knowing that the work andlabor in the Church and Kingdom ofGod will augment and increase from thistime forth with greater rapidity than ithas ever done, until the coming of theSon of man, and thoroughly compre-hending the fact that myself, with manyof the leading men and fathers in Israelwill soon pass to the other side of the veil, my spirit is ready to cry out, "Where,O where, O Lord, is the material whichthou hast ordained to step forth andtake our places and the places of thefathers in Zion, to take the Church, theZion and Kingdom of God, and bear itoff triumphant, and prepare it as theBride, the Lamb's Wife, for the coming of the great Bridegroom?" I will confessthat I know not where to look for thiselement, if it is not to be found in the young men who dwell in these moun-tains of Israel. I am satisfied it can notbe found anywhere else upon the face ofthe whole earth.With this great fact and eternal truthstanding boldly before my face, whatcan I say to my young friends, young brothers, young men of Zion? You arestepping forth into manhood as membersof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many of you are alreadybearing the holy Priesthood and officiat-ing in its various offices. Many of youhave parents who have labored faithfullyto build up the Church and Kingdom ofGod on the earth, and have finished their testimony, and to-day are in thespirit world. Many of you have parents still living who will soon close their tes-timony and also pass away. So far as Iam concerned, having reached my fourscore years, I do not know that I shallever be permitted again in the flesh tomeet with the young men in Zion, in thecapacity of a mutual improvement asso-ciation, or in their public assemblies.So far as that is concerned, it matterethnot. But I wish I had power to express myself as I feel to the children, to theyoung men and women of the Latter-day Saints, who dwell in these moun-tains. I wish the veil could be liftedfrom off their eyes, that they could seewhat lies before them, that they couldsee their destiny, that they could seeunto what they are ordained. I wish,my young friends, that you could com-prehend the magnitude and value of thegreat work which the God of Heaven isabout to place upon your shoulders.Could the visions of your minds be opened to see the great work yourHeavenly Father, the Father of your spirits, ordained you to before the world was, to enter into the flesh on the earthin the last days, and take the Kingdomof our God and bear it off triumphant,and prepare it for the coming of the Son of Man! I say, if you could see thesetruths and comprehend them, you wouldlabor with all your might, mind andstrength to prepare yourselves and qual-ify yourselves, not only with the Priest-hood, but with the powers of that Priest-hood and with the power of God, toenter into the ministry and labor byfaith, that you may be able to stand trueand faithful to God and to your cove-nants. For you stand on the earth in theday when the judgments, wrath and in-dignation of Almighty God are about tobe poured out upon the wicked of all nations.Jesus Christ is the light of the world,the light that shineth in darkness, and 
 brief life to shut out the hopes of that tocome, nor quench the light that shouldcheer even in affliction. Narrow not thesources of comfort and happiness byselfishly debasing godlike powers. Donot hunger after perishable riches, buthelp the needy, thus keeping open thefountain of mercy, love and charity.Shun, we beseech you, as you would thedeadly upas, the vulgarity of unseemlystruggles for place and power.When Eli permitted his sons to asso-ciate with harlots outside the Temple,while they lived on the fruits of thepeople's labor, the Lord spoke throughthe boy Samuel and foretold whatshould result. [##1 Samuel 2-3##] A few of our youth havefollowed the example of Eli's sons.Their course has been downward, andthey have trodden the path leading todestruction. Among all your acquaint-ances think of one who, having desertedand turned away from the Lord, hasgained thereby peace, happiness or greatness. Have they not, without ex-ception, been as the moth that falls intothe burning blaze? Have not thoseseeking the "liberty" of saloons, gamb-ling dens and the companionship of theunclean had their wings clipped in theflames of a quenchless fire?As you value happiness, peace andjoy, as you hope for salvation and exal-tation, go not near the haunts of vice.They allure only to destroy. Sound care-fully the causes leading to infidelity anddoubt, note the actions of those whoslur the things of God, and you will findthat vice has stained the body andblotted the soul. The Holy Spirit ofGod dwells not in unclean tabernacles;and he who sins and repents not, doubts;and he who doubts is damned. Converse-ly, to him that believeth the things ofGod all things, whether in heaven, earthor hell, will be made possible. Go not, therefore, into the wilderness of sin tolean upon broken reeds, but hold fast tothe "rod of iron" leading to the fruitsof eternal life. [##1 Nephi 8:19##] While earnestly seekingfor knowledge to be found in goodbooks, bear in mind the fact that theHoly Ghost is the safest and most pro-found instructor. He will bring to yourmind things past and present, and showyou things to come. Seek therefore hisconstant fellowship, and his teachingsshall make you wise, good and great,and finally lead you back into the pre-sence of your Heavenly Father.With all the accumulated wisdom,knowledge and understanding of theworld, what did the people know of thelaws of God until Joseph, the boy pro-phet, came? In the midst of the glare ofmodern civilization and enlightenmentthe Bible was as a sealed book. Theharmonies of the universe seemed con-fusion, while professed ministers taughtthe doom of everlasting damnation alikefor ignorant heathens and innocent chil-dren, neither of whom had heard ofChrist. Holding their dupes over theflames of an imaginative hell, they pro-claimed the hideous doctrine of non-re-demption beyond the grave. Whileleading redhanded murderers, all drip-ping in the blood of innocence, to thehangman's scaffold and there promisingthem, as they died, a free pass into thebosom of the stainless Christ, theypreached the consignment of unbaptizedinfants forever to the regions of the damned!Blind leaders of the blind, how couldthey know God and His ways? Howcould they measure His infinite love?An earthly father, doing with his chil-dren what they claimed God daily didwith his, would have been regarded, evenin the dark ages, as an unmitigated,merciless tyrant. No wonder that suchdense ignorance should produce the soilof skepticism, out of which has growninfidel iconoclasts, whose intelligentshrewdness plays upon the darkness ofsuch unholy doctrines, as electricity playsupon the blackness of night. Undertheir teachings the loving husbandand confiding wife parted forever at thegrave! How awful the thought indicatedin the mocking marriage ceremony pro-claiming union only "until death do youpart." Were that all, then indeed wouldthis world and its brief joys be but adelusion and a snare! But it is not all.In heaven there are fathers and mothersand children; husbands and wives eter- 
 hundred and thirty-five miles, to LittleRock, begging our food by the way.At Little Rock we took the militaryroad, having tied up our canoe, andwaded the great Mississippi swamp toMemphis, Tenn., nearly one hundredand seventy-five miles, most of the wayin mud and water knee deep. BrotherBrown took a steamer at Memphis andreturned to Kirtland, while I traveledalone to middle Tennessee.On my arrival at Memphis, I calledupon Mr. Jackson, who kept a publichouse, and asked to stay over night.When I said I was a preacher he ex-pressed his belief that I was an impostorand insisted that I should preach to a congregation that he would gather to-gether, and they should judge whetherI was a preacher or not. I spoke anhour and a quarter to a crowded house,and so many things were revealed con-cerning themselves that I do not thinkthe same congregation will ever meetagain for the same purpose. I met withElders David Patten, and Warren Par-rish, in middle Tennessee and laboredwith them to the end of the year 1835.Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder onthe twenty-eighth of June 1835. I wasordained a Seventy and enrolled as amember of the second quorum of Seven-ties on the thirty-first day of May 1836,by Elders David Patten and WarrenParrish. I traveled and preached inTennessee from the twenty-seventh ofMarch 1835, until the twentieth of Sep-tember 1836, at which time I was releasedto return to Kirtland. I organized thefirst company of Saints in the South togo to Far West which numbered twenty-two souls. While holding the office ofan Elder in Tennessee eleven months, Itraveled two thousand five hundred andthirty-seven miles, held one hundred andeighty-two meetings, baptized forty-eight, ordained two Elders, two Priests,three Teachers, eight Deacons and blessed nineteen children. On the sec-ond of October 1836, I started for Kirt-land in company with A. O. Smoot andJesse Turpin, and arrived at Kirtland onthe twenty-fifth of October 1836, when Ihad a happy meeting with the Prophet,Apostles and Elders in the Temple of the Lord. I spent the winter of 1836-7 in Kirtland, and attended the school taughtby Prof. Haws, studying English andLatin grammar. I was set apart as a member of the first quorum of Seventieson the third of January 1837. I attendedthe meetings and received my washingsand anointings in the Kirtland Templein the spring of 1837. I then passedthrough all the troubles and stirringevents of that period.On the thirteenth of April, 1837, I wasjoined in marriage with Miss Phebe W.Carter, of Scarborough, Maine, at thehouse of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Theceremony was performed by PresidentFrederick G. Williams, and we wereblessed by the Patriarch, Father JosephSmith. Forty-eight days from this event,on the thirty-first of May, I took theparting hand of my wife and all myfriends in Kirtland and started upon amission to Fox Islands, in the VineHaven Bay, in the State of Maine. I wasaccompanied by Elder Milton Holmesand Jonathan H. Hale. On our journeywe crossed Lake Ontario and visited theSaints, attended conference, administeredto the sick and evil spirits were subjectto us by the power of God. We continuedour journey, recrossed Lake Ontario andvisited Farmington, my native place, andfor the first time since I had joined theChurch visited my father's house. Ipreached the Gospel to my relatives andbaptized my uncle Ozem Woodruff andhis wife Hannah and son John. This was in fulfilment of a dream I had whenI was eight years old. On my returnfrom Fox Islands I baptized my father,stepmother and only sister, also DwightWebster, a Methodist class leader, whowas boarding at my father's house. Iorganized a small branch of the Churchof nine members, eight of whom weremy relatives. I preached to a large con-gregation in the Methodist meetinghouse at Farmington. My wife joinedme at Farmington and accompanied meto Scarborough, Maine, and we visitedher father's house, it being my first visit.I was kindly received.On the nineteenth of August, 1837, I 
 OFFICE OF THE GENERAL SUPERIN-TENDENCY OF THE Y.M.M.I.A.Salt Lake City, Utah, March 17, 1891.To the Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.DEAR BRETHREN: At the approach-ing April Conference, a meeting of the Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A. will be held for the purpose of giving instruc-tions in relation to the work of the As-sociations.

 THE COURSE OF READING. Two years ago we attempted to introduce acourse of reading, designed for the enter-tainment and instruction of our members at their homes. The introduction of thissystem for the purpose of forming correct habits of reading we regarded as a veryimportant part of the work of MutualImprovement. While the success of theintroduction has not been all that wehoped for it, we think it is because our plan and purpose have not been fully ex-plained. We shall undertake by letter and missionary assistance to the severalstakes to make the value of this Course of Reading known, and in the meantime invite all the associations, which have notdone so, to make an effort to take it upwith as many members as possible.TESTIMONIES. As one of the leadingobjects of the associations is to secureto their members testimonies of the Truth, we suggest that exercises designedto accomplish this be prescribed and in-sisted upon in every association.MUSIC—As a feature of great interest, in all our meetings, vocal music claimsour attention. By the election of Prof. Evan Stephens as Musical Director of the associations, and the enterprise of THE CONTRIBUTOR in publishing appro-priate pieces and offering a number of premiums for the best musical exercisesat our next annual conference, we trust that good results will be obtained, and hope that the associations will generallymake a special effort to work up this feature of the exercises. We should like, if possibe, to have a chorus from our membership of five hundred voices to take part in our conference next June.BRIEF LECTURES—The practice of speaking a few moments upon given sub-jects is one that involves previous researchand reflection, and at the same time cul-tivates force and concentration in thoughtand speech that cannot fail to be of great benefit to all who expect to devote apart, at least, of their lives to public speaking. The scriptural, scientific, his-torical, and other subjects, which have been published for the associations in THE CONTRIBUTOR afford a wide rangefrom which programmes may be made.AMUSEMENTS. We desire the Young Men's Associations to co-operate with theAssociations of the Young Ladies in pro-viding amusements for our young people. There should be an improvement made in the quality and social character of ourconcerts and dancing parties, which we believe these Associations are qualified with the aid and direction of the Ward officers to effect. We recommend that the Associations arrange to give two or three or more parties in their respectivewards during the coming season, that shall be an improvement over any thathave ever been given before. Proper atten-tion to this subject will enable us to inter-est our young people and prevent them seeking amusements under auspices thatare evil.ORGANIZATION. The officers acting last year are expected to continue in officeuntil their successors are chosen. At an early meeting in October they should besustained for the ensuing season. If forany cause changes are desirable, they should be made at this meeting.Regular weekly meetings should beheld, and we trust that nothing will be permitted to interfere with them. We certainly think that at least one eveningin the week should be devoted exclu-sively to the work of mutual improve-ment of our young men.RECORDS AND REPORTS. Our partialfailure in the past to obtain full and cor-rect reports we believe is due to the fail-ure of the secretaries to keep full andcorrect records. We would like to effect a reformation in this respect and take this occasion to request all our secretariesto provide themselves, at the commence-ment of the season, with suitable roll and record books in which the names of members may be enrolled and a faithfulrecord kept of the exercises rendered during the season.The stake and ward officers are urgently requested to give diligent atten-tion to these subjects and to take up theseason's labors for the welfare of ouryoung men with prayerful earnestnessand a determination to awaken and main-tain interest in the associations which have been organized under the inspiration of 
 the darkness comprehendeth it not.Neither does this generation compre-hend the work of the Latter-day Saints.I do hope and pray that you, my youngbrothers in the ministry, will call uponthe Lord in mighty prayer, that you maybe clothed upon by the power of God,that you may be able to lead the way forthe rising generation in which you liveto walk in the path that leads to eternallife and salvation, that you may have aninheritance in the celestial kingdom ofGod.The great work the Lord has set Hishand to perform in the last days will notstop. The Lord will not disappoint this generation in the fulfillment of Hiswords, any more than He did in otherages. Any person who is in the posses-sion of the Spirit of God, sufficient todiscern the signs of the times, can seeclearly that the revelations of God inthe Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc-trine and Covenants are being fulfilled,and they will all be fulfilled to the veryletter, and to the very end. The Chris-tian Gentile world to-day are very fastrejecting the Gospel of life and salvation,sent unto them by the revelation of JesusChrist, through the administration ofangels in fulfillment of the revelations ofSt. John. The present crusade againstthe Saints in Utah, the late act of ourgovernment in yielding to the publicclamor of the priest and the people, thepulpit and the press, in passing laws totake away the civil, religious and politi-cal rights from two hundred thousandLatter-day Saints because of their reli-gion; and for the rulers of this greatrepublican government to trample undertheir feet the most sacred principles ofthe Constitution, to gratify the clamor ofour persecutors, is enough to pall theheart of every reflecting mind through-out the world. Would the rulers of our nation have taken such a step against anyother people on earth, except againstthe Church of Jesus Christ and thekingdom of God on the earth? Theywould not.The God of Heaven established theAmerican government for a wise pur-pose in Himself, and gave our fore-fathers a glorious Constitution by inspira-tion, the best Constitution ever given to a human government, as a rich legacy tobe handed down to their posterity. Willnot that same God hold the rulers of thenation responsible, who trample that Con-stitution under their feet and break it inpieces for the purpose of destroying a people, who are seeking to build up theChurch and Kingdom of God on theearth? He most assuredly will. Ournation by these acts is turning the last key that will seal its condemnation anddestruction. For the Lord has decreedit in revelations ever given upon thissubject.Now, my young brethren, I want to say to you that you are about to stepforth upon the stage of action in thebeginning of the revolution, changes,and judgments which are about to over-whelm and engulf our nation and thenations of the earth. You are bound to take the offices, places and responsibili-ties of those whose heads are blossomedfor the tomb and will soon pass away.Therefore I am anxious for you, theboys and young men in Zion, to see thenecessity of beginning immediately toprepare yourselves for the work that liesbefore you. You are the lawful heirs tothe Priesthood. The Lord has called andordained you to His work. You neednot heed the scoffs or ridicule of thepersecutors of the Saints. Their un-belief will not make the truths of God of none effect. The day is at hand whenthe blasphemers will hold their lips.My young brothers, you have no timeto lose or throw away. Solomon saysthere is a time for all things. I think thetime has come when our young menshould call upon the Lord in prayer andlabor to obtain the Holy Ghost as theirconstant companion, and seek out of thebest books, by study and by faith, totreasure up knowledge, wisdom andunderstanding. There is a day of mourn-ing and lamentation approaching theearth. I want the young people, as wellas their parents, to be prepared for it.Yet the Lord will defend Zion andestablish His kingdom, and bring offHis Saints victorious. 
 ally bound together in the bands of love,cemented by holy sacred covenants madeon earth.What a flood of light, what a heavenof joy, came from God through His un-cultured boy prophet! Until he came,this world seemed as a black wildernessof woe, beyond which no heavenly lightappeared. As the sun lights from theeast to the west, so the revelations ofAlmighty God have penetrated ourhearts and given us comprehension ofearthly and heavenly things. This, or a future generation, will produce historianswhose delight it shall be to trace theeffects among God's children of the mar-velous light brought in the world in ourday through the instrumentality of thegreat modern revelator. It was indeeda startling declaration to the world whenhe fearlessly proclaimed that God againhad spoken from the heavens! Ignorancestood amazed, while scoffing hypocrisyraged; but the work of human redemp-tion goes bravely on, while the meek and poor and honest rejoice.Upon you, dear young brethren, muchdepends. Upon your shoulders the Al-mighty is rolling responsibilities themagnitude of which has never been ex-ceeded in any age. The kingdom of Godrevealed by Joseph will be given to noother people. It will never fall. Be yetherefore to its interest and advance-ment faithful and true. Its governmentis of heaven, and under it human libertyand the rights of man shall blossom andbloom into perfect fruit, for the Gospelof Christ is a perfect law of liberty. Whyshould any dread its sway? Christ is theking, and has not He earned the rightto the dominion and rule of His own?His kingdom is not autocratic, neitherwholly theocratic. It is indeed theo-dem-ocratic—the voice of God and thesanction of the people. Its laws rec-ognize everywhere the doctrine of com-mon consent. The Almighty in thebeginning gave to man the right to ex-ercise his own agency. He will neverdeprive him of that privilege, for by noother means can he ever develop thegodhead within him. Those alone whosell their bodies and barter their souls toSatan will be in danger of binding them-selves with chains too strong to bebroken by man's love of freedom or byGod's decree of human liberty.He who fought the Christ of God inheaven and was cast down to hell, stillforges chains with which to bind thesouls of men. From the beginning Luci-fer was an ambitious tyrant and accuserof his brethren. Heavenly hosts weptwhen they saw the misery and woe hewould work for the inhabitants of earth.But the final great struggle is fast ap-proaching. Let us fear not the result, forChrist and His people shall conquer here, as He and they conquered there.Pending the great final day of the LordAlmighty, let it be your duty, youngmen of Israel, to fast and pray, so that"your bowels may be full of charitytowards all men, and to the householdof faith, that virtue may garnish thythoughts unceasingly, then shall thy con-fidence wax strong in the presence ofGod, and the doctrines of the Priesthoodshall distil upon thy soul as the dews ofheaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thyconstant companion, and thy sceptre anunchanging sceptre of righteousness andtruth, and thy dominion shall be aneverlasting dominion, and without com-pulsory means it shall flow unto thee,for ever and ever."Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F. Smith,Moses Thatcher,General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A. 
 To the Officers and Members of theYoung Men's Mutual ImprovementAssociations Throughout the World:DEAR BRETHREN: Recognizing thegreat importance of this organization,and fully appreciating the efforts made bythose having the spirit of the work at heart, and desiring most earnestly tomake continuous, in the spirit of itsplanning, the effective work of mutualeducation now in progress among ourpeople; and, furthermore, sensing themagnitude of this educational force, andknowing that membership is a blessingand a privilege priceless in character,although not yet fully valued and by 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.JUNIUS F. WELLS, EDITOR.SALT LAKE CITY, SEPTEMBER, 1891.Y.M.M.I.A. MANUAL.EARLY in September there will be is-sued by the General Superintendency a Manual or Reference Book for thecoming year's work in the Young Men's Associations. It will be comprehensive in its nature, will include many of the les-sons heretofore published in THE CON-TRIBUTOR and is designed to assist stake superintendents and ward presidents in carrying on in a uniform manner the various Mutual Improvement organiza-tions of the Church. The book will be a necessary text-book for every officer and will include names of general officers, of stake superintendents, annual circu-lar letter of General Superintendency, instructions to superintendents, presidents and members, diagrams, bibliography and index, and a thorough course for one year in theology, history, science and literature. The plan for the year's course is marked out in twenty-five lectures oneach of the subjects named. Under the heading of theology appear lectures onthe Gospel with full analysis of B. H. Roberts' work. Under history is givenlectures on the Bible, Book of Mormon, New Testament, the Church, Cannon's Life of Nephi, and England; Under science, Talmage's First Book of Nature, and civil government; under literature, Readings from Irving, and references to American literature generally.The Manual is not merely an an-nouncement of the year's work, but is of itself educational in character and if studied and properly used, will go far towards placing every association organ-ized in successful operation.The annual letter of the General Superintendency announcing the Manual and the season's work is as follows:To the Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.:DEAR BRETHREN: In addressing our annual letter to you, we take pleasure inintroducing this Manual which under our appointment and direction has been carefully compiled by Assistant General Superintendent Milton H. Hardy, and Stake Superintendent George H.

 took the steamer Bangor, at Portland,with Elder Hale and arrived at Owl'sHead at sunset, without any means tocontinue our journey or get a meal ofvictuals; we went on to a high hill andbowed ourselves before the Lord, andprayed that our way might be opened.The spirit of the Lord rested upon usand testified to us that our prayers wouldbe answered. As we arose from ourprayers, a sloop came sailing into theharbor. We went to the captain andenquired where he was going. He saidright through the channel to VinalHaven. He took us on board andlanded us on North Fox Island, at twoo'clock in the morning. We commencedpreaching in the Baptist meeting houseon the twentieth of August. Brother Hale stayed with me one month andtwelve days. -[The history of this mis-sion is published in full in No. 20, Vol.8, Deseret News.]- Brother Hale startedfor Kirtland October second; I accom-panied him to Scarborough, and returnedto the Island on the second of Novem-ber accompanied by my wife. I spent thewinter of 1838 upon the Islands accom-panied a short time by Brother JamesTownshend. During my mission uponthe Islands I was opposed by the Bap-tist minister, Gideon J. Newton, of theNorth Island, and by Elder Douglass, aMethodist minister of the South Island.Both made war upon me, but the con-gregations of both embraced the Gos-pel and I baptized most of their mem-bers. I received a letter from PresidentThomas B. Marsh, on the sixteenth ofAugust, 1838, informing me that I hadbeen called by revelation to fill a vacancyin the quorum of the Twelve Apostles,in the place of one who had fallen. Ihad organized a company of fifty-threeof those I had baptized to go to Missouriin the Fall of 1838. As they were allfishermen and knew nothing about trav-eling, I went on to the mainland andpurchased horses, wagons and harness,and fitted them out for their journey,and on the fourth of October we startedon our travels. We traveled through rain,mud, frost and snow with much suffering,and buried several who died on theway, arriving at Rochester, SangamonCounty, Illinois, on December nineteenth,where I spent the winter in providingfor my family and company.On the thirteenth of March, 1839, I took my family and went to Quincy,Illinois. Arrived there on the sixteenth,where I saw the suffering of the Saintswho lay upon the banks of the Missis-sippi river, who had been driven fromMissouri for their religion, and this be-fore the subject of Polygamy had beenrevealed to the Church or to the world.I accompanied President Young andseveral of the Twelve to the TempleBlock in Far West, where we laid thecorner stone of the Temple, upon whichstone, on the twenty-sixth of April, 1837,Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smithwere ordained Apostles and members ofthe quorum of the Twelve. This meet-ing was appointed by revelation andcommandment and we performed allthat we were commanded to do. Wereturned to Quincy on the second day of May. While we were performing thisjourney Joseph the Prophet and hisbrother Hyrum got out of prison inMissouri and arrived at Quincy, where wemet with them, their families and friendsand had a joyous time. I accompaniedPresident Brigham Young with ourfamilies from Quincy to Nauvoo andsettled at Montrose. I was with JosephSmith and the Twelve Apostles on thetwenty-first of July, 1839, which was theday of God's power with the Prophet.He healed a score of the sick by thepower of God; they were raised up fromtheir beds of sickness, some of thembeing nigh unto death, including ElijahGraham and Bates Nobles.The Twelve Apostles were command-ed of the Lord to go to Great Britain on amission and to carry the gospel of Christto that land. As I was preparing tostart on the twenty-fifth of July, 1839 Iwas attacked with the chills and fever forthe first time in my life, my wife and childwere also sick. On the eighth of AugustI arose, sick, from my bed, laid my handsupon my wife and child, blessed them andleft them in the hands of the Lord, with not more than four days provisions in the
