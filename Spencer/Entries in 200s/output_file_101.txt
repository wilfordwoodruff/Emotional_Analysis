I had but 24 hours to spend with them I happily improved it. I never enjoyed a better visit  with them, my mind had been deeply impressed for  weeks that I had somthing to do for my parents  before they died, now was my time. My father was  near seventy ^67^ years of age I might never see him again that night I shall never forget while time endures, eternity alone can ownly unfold the strength of its  deeds. As the sable shades of night drew her serene curtin ore the earth. to still the cares of day we met   ENDENTRY alone; none but congeniel spirits there. Wilford arose (and with the spirit of a Joseph rewards his father Jacob) opened his heart FIGURE to his father and spoke his mind, the sentime nt was recieved. I lade my hands upon my Fathers Aphek  head (and according to the authority of the Priesthood and  Apostleship confered upon me by the revelations of Jesus Christ under the hands of the Twelve Apostles, President B. Young being  mouth upon the cornor stone of the house of the Lord in far west in the land of Zion,) I ordained My father Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an high Priest and Patriarch after the order of Melchezedeck I sealed him up unto eternal life I placed upon his head the seals of the covenant one and a half lines illegible and struck out When all was oer it  was right, my soul was satisfyed, I had accomplished  what my soul longed after.

I had a desire in my heart that all the ordinances of the fulness  of the gospel might also be administered unto father  and mother Carter that they may sleep in peace may God grant the request.

I conversed with the quorum of the Twelve Elder B. Young expressed his feelings to me upon a variety of subjects among others wished me to keep an account  of things as he should look to me for his journal some day. Brothers Pratt were quite sociable as  to Elder Lyman Wight we were always on good terms we had an interesting time together, we talked over old  times and looked forward to new ones.

Elder Kimball had a dream last evening thought he was preaching to a large congregation said the Prophet Joseph Smith had laid the foundation for a great work and it was now for us to build upon it. He thought Br Joseph was present and appeared  natural. We took the steemer St Croix and  left Nauvoo we had a plesant sail  through the day and evening, though some  unplesant feelings during the evening.    ENDENTRY August 6, 1844 ~ Tuesday   6th FIGURE We stoped at various places on the  river among others Burlington, after  which we prepared our minds to once  more behold the city of Nauvoo and embrace our  families ^and friends^ we arived in the city of Nauvoo at  8 oclock in the evening at the upper stone house we were hailed with Joy by all the Citizens we met. I accompanied the quorum of the Twelve to their families after which I was  conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to once  ^more^ embrace my wife and children. I spent the night at home with my family, thus it is with me. I have  not spent but one summer either at home or with  the church, for the last 10 years as my lot has been all the day long in the vineyard. I go and come from  year to year distance from Galenia to Nauvoo 250 m when we landed in the city there was a deep gloom seemed to rest over the city of Nauvoo which we never experienced before   ENDENTRY August 7, 1844 ~ Wednesday   Aug 7th 1844, I went forth this morning through  the city of Nauvoo saw many friends and met with the quorum of the twelve at Elder Taylors we were truly glad to see each other Br Taylor  was getting well of his wounds, that he recieved  in Jail in company with Hiram Smith  when they were murdered, we were glad to  see Dr Richards who escaped unhurt, we were recived with gladness by the Saints throughout the  city they felt like sheep without a shepherd, as being  without a father, as their head had been taken  away. We spent the fore part of the day at Br Taylors, and in the afternoon, we met in Council at the Seventies Hall. viz the Twelve, High Council, and  High Priest andc and we herd Sidney Rigdon tell his  story and message which he had to us and the Church a long story it was a kind of second class vision he said he was appointed to come and offer  himself to lead the Church, and many things  was said. He was followed by Br Brigham  Young and he showed that their could not be  any one before the Twelve. A conference was  appointed for the whole Church to come together  on Tuesday next at 10 oclok.    ENDENTRY August 8, 1844 ~ Thursday   8th Their was a meeting appointed at the grove for the church to come together for prayer But in consequence of some excitement among the  People and a dispositions by some spirits to try to divide  the church, it was thought best to attend to the  business of the church in the afternoon that was to be attended to on Tuesday, the Twelve spent their time in the fore part of the day at the  office and in the afternoon met at the grove the following is the business of the day.   ENDENTRY Aug 8th 1844 FIGURE All the authorities of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in and  about Nauvoo met in a special conference  in the grove in Nauvoo at 3 oclock. The quorum of  the Twelve, Councillors A Lyman, the  High Council, and others occupied the Stand, the  High Priest, quorum, and quorum of the Seventies and  Elders, Pishops Priests Teachers and deacons appeared  in their several quorums and took their seats and  also a vast congregation of Saints, when all was  seated that could get seats, President B. Young arose and said Attention all  this congregation makes me think of the days of  king Benjamin when the People was so great that  they could not make them hear, But we want  your attention. Wm W Phelps was called  upon to address the throne of grace which he did do  most fervently. President B Young again  arose and said let none complain because of the  situation of the congregation. we have all done the best  we could.    For the first time in my life, for the first time in  your lives, for the first time in the kingdom of God do I step forth to act in my capacity in connexion  with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles of Jesus  Christ unto the People and to bear of the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world. And for the first time are you called to walk by faith not by sight, for  always before you have had a Prophet as the mouth  of the Lord to speak to you. but he has sealed his  testimony with his Blood. I now want to ask  each of you to tell me if you want to chuse a   ENDENTRY gardeen guardian, a Prophet, evangelist or sumthing els as your head to lead you all that are in favor of it  make it manifest by raising the right hand. No hands  raised. All that wants to draw away a party from  the church after them let them do it if they can but they will not prosper. I now wish to speak of  the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints; Amasa Lyman were counsellors to Joseph. I ask whare is Joseph he is gone beyound the vail, and for them to act in  their office as his cooncillors they must go beyond  the veil whare he is. Their has been much said about  Presiden Rigdon being president of the Church  leading the People, being the head, andc If the People want President Rigdon to lead them, they may  have him. But I say unto you that the quorum  of The Twelve have the keys of the kingdom  of God in all the world, they stand next to Joseph  and are the Presidency of the Church, and hold  the keys and would have to ordain any man unto  that appointment if one that should be chosen ie if one  was to be chosen. You cannot appoint any man at our head. we should have to ordain him, you cannot  appoint a man at our head, But if you want any  other man to lead you, take him, and we will go  our way to build up the kingdom in all the world.  Perhaps some think that president Rigdon would  not be honored But if he does right he will not act  against our council nor we against his but act together but I repeat again No man can stand at our head.  The Prophet Joseph has lade the foundation for  a great work, and we will build upon it. Do you  want a Patriarch for the whole church it would  have been the right of Samuel Smith if he had  lived, but he is dead John Smith it is their right. Do you want a trustee   ENDENTRY in trust if so look at a bishop, it is their place  to attend to temporal matters they never yet have  acted in their station. Elder S. Rigdon  claims to be a spokesman to Joseph, vary well he  is but can he now act in that office if he wants  now to be a spokesman to the prophet, he must go  to the other side of the veil for the Prophet is there But Elder Rigdon is here. why will Elder Rigdon  be a fool. Let those who holds the keys of the  kingdom of God build it up in all the world. If their  is a spokesman if he is a king and Priest let him go  and build up a kingdom this is his right, and it is  the right of many here but who is the head?  the Twelve. if one Thousand rise up and say they  have the Prophets Joseph shoes I know they are impost- ures If you know how the church is organized I  wish to ask a question. Now If you want Rigdon  Law to lead you or any body els, you may  have them, But I tel you in the name of the  Lord, that no man can put another betwen  the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph, why because Joseph was their file leader and he has  committed into there hands the keys of the  kingdom for all the world. dont put a thread  between the Priesthood and God I will ask who  has stood next to Joseph and Hiram. I have and  I will stand next to him. we have a head, and that head is the Twelve and we can now begin to  see the neccessity of the Apostleship I will now  close and give way for my brethren.   Elder A Lyman arose and said, I will say a few  words. I am satisfyed with the open frank manner  that Elder Young has addressed this assembly.  I ownly take exceptions to my name being associated  with Wm Law. Elder Young asks Pardon it   ENDENTRY is granted. I believe their is no power or, officer  or means wanted to carry on the work but what  is in the Twelve, the right has been presented  by Elder Young and I will back him up. President  Young has stood next to the Prophet Joseph  with the Twelve and I have stood next to them  and I will still stand next to them. We have  a head here what is that head? the quorum of the Twelve we now se the necessity of  the Apostleship. I might rise up as well as any  other man to ask for the head but I could not  do it without endangering my salvation. But  I will stand unto the Twelve the same as I did  to Joseph either on one side or the other  but not before them. President Rigdon  called upon W. W. Phelps to speak in his  behalf as he could not speak.   Phelps arose and said, he believed their  had been enough said to Prepare the minds  of the People to act. I have seen the people  submit with defference to the authority of the church. I have seen the People take their lives in their hand and gather subjects for the  kingdom of God. I have seen them prepare  for war and ready to pour out their hearts  Blood, and I am happy to see the same  disposition manifest here today as was when  Joseph and Hiram Smith was brought dead  murdered to this city, then you submitted  to the Law and to God and I see the same  thing today you are ready to submit to the authority of God the Twelve are chosen  to rise up and bear the Church off triumphant I ^have^ feelings about this esspecially for president  Rigdon their is a quorum that the 12 belong to Br Rigdon was brought to the same quorum   ENDENTRY and received in part the blessings. Joseph  has gone but he has not left us comfortless, for  he will administer unto us I will bear this testimony in 2 nights after he was slain he came to me (and I thought their was a large building stood on  wheels, and he said tell the drivers to drive on I  asked if the building was on wheels. yes so  we drove all round the hills and valleys and  finally over the river into Iowa. I told him  Devil Creek was before us I dont care said he for  Devil Creek drive over it and we did so)  their is a combination in Nauvoo to stand for ^destroy^  all that stand for Joseph, but  let us go ahead and build up the Temple and  you will then be endowed. If you want to  do right uphold the Twelve. If they die I am willing to die with them. But do your duty  and you will be endowed, I will sustain the  Twelve. Joseph and Hiram are removed  whare they can convers with the Gods beyound  the reach of Powder and ball.   P. P. Pratt arose and said if their was wicked men in this city that was so bad it was because  we supported them. Stop dealing with them  and they will go away. will I support them No. I am willing to do good to all men esspecially to  the household of faith, except mobs and wicked men will scease when you scease to support them I would rather die a natural death than to employ  a wicked doctor to kill me    President Young arose and said their is more business than we can do this afternoon but we  can place ourselves in a situation to continue   ENDENTRY the business without calling the whold Church I dont want you to abide my council alone  but act for yourselves. If you want Sidney Rigdon  to lead you vote for him but if you dont intend  to follow him, and support him as you did Joseph and I would say the same for the Twelve  dont make a covenant to support them unless  you intend to abide by their council. But we  want to know if this people will support the Priesthood If you build the house you will get the endowm- ent. If we do our best and cannot build the  house we will go into the wilderness and get  it. will you take our council. The first is  do you want President Rigdon to be the head  or do the Saints want the Twelve to Stand as  the head. the first Presidency of the church  and at the head of this Kingdom in all the  world, stand next to Joseph, walk up into  their calling, hold the Keys of this Kingdom All that are in favor of this in all the congre- gation of the Saints manifest it by holding  up the right hand. Their was sea of hands  a universal vote, a contrary vote was called  and not a hand was raised in all the con- gregation. Let President Rigdon go and raise  up a mighty kingdom. Our feelings are to let  Marsh stand as the President of this stake.  Joseph has loved this People unto death and  Hiram has loved Joseph and this People unto  death. If the The Twelve had been here  I would not have seen him given up, he should  not have been given up. He was in your  midst But you did not know him he has been  taken away for the People are not worthy  of him. But let not men think that the kingdom  of God, is rent from you it is not, if we were all   ENDENTRY dead the High Priest would rise up and with  the keys of the Kingdom build up the kingdom let men go to a healthy country and get a foot hold, so as to be sustained in the midst of our persecution. The Saints will still be tithed  untill the temple is done all that is in favor of being tithed untill the temple is finished  make it manifest with the usual sign it was  a universal vote. Would it be the feelings  of the people to support the Twelve in all the  world in their missions. It was a universal vote  Will the Twelve People let the Twelve regu- lated the financial concerns of the Church A universal vote   The Patriarchal Priesthood belongs to the  Smith family, if Samuel had lived it would have been his right, but as it is will the people leave the matter the Twelve, it was  A universal vote.

I discoverd what  the emotions of the people were on my arival  to this city, and I have come here to say, how  do you do to all parties and I do now say How do  you do at this time. I meet you with a heart  full of gratitude to Almighty God and I presume  you all feel the same I hardly know how to  express my feelings I feel as strong as a  Gient I pulled sticks with the men coming  along and I pulled up the strongest man  theire was on the road with one hand and  two could not pull me up and I continued  to pull untill I pulled them to Nauvoo I will  pass from that subject then. There has been  great excitement in the Country and since  those men took me I have been cool and  dispassionate through the whole: thank God I  am now in the hands of the Municipal  Court of Nauvoo and not in the hands of  Missourians. It has been discussed by  the great and wise men Layif lawyiers andc  O your Powers and legal tribunals are not  to be sanctioned and here we will not make it  lawful to drag away inocent men from  their families and friends and have them unla- wfully put to death by ungodly men for ther  religion. Relative to our Charter Courts  right of Hebeas Corpus andc we have all  power: And if any man from this time  forth says any thing contrary; cast   ENDENTRY it into his teeth. Their is a secret in  this; if their is not power in our Charter,  and Courts, then there is not power in  the State of Illinois, nor in the Congress  ^or Constitution^ of the United States for the United States  gave unto Illinois her constitution, and Charter  and Illinois gave unto Nauvoo her Charters  which have ceded unto unto us our vested  rights and has no right or power to take them  from us all the power their was in the Illinois  she gave to Nauvoo. And any man that says  to the contrary is a fool. I want you to learn  O Israel what is for the happiness and peace of this  City and people. If our enemies are determined to  oppress us and deprive us of our rights and privileges  as they have done and if the Authorities that be  on the earth will not assist us in our rights nor  give us that protection which the Laws and Constitu- tion of the United States and of this State garre- ntees unto us: then we will claim them from  higher power from heaven and from God  Almighty and the Constitution andc I SWEAR  I will not deal so mildly with them again  for the time has come when forbearance is no  longer a virtue, and if you are again taken  unlawfully you are at liberty to give loose to  Blood and Thunder. But act with Almighty Power. But good luck for me as it always has been in evry  time of trouble friends though strangers were  raised up unto me and assisted me. The time has  come when the veil is torn off from the State of  Illinois and they have deliverd me from the State  of Missouri: friends that were raised up unto me  would have spilt their blood for me to have delive- red me then I told them not I would be delivered ENDENTRY By the power of God and Generalship and I have  brought them to Nauvoo and treated them kindly  I have had the privilege of rewarding them  good for evil, they took me unlawfully treated  me rigorously, strove to deprive me of my  rights and would have run me to Missouri to have  been murdered if providence had not inter- posed: but now they are in my hands, I took  them into my house set them at the head  of my table and set the best before them my  house afforded and they were waited upon by  my wife whome they deprived of seeing  me when I was taken. I shall be discharged  by the Municipal Court of Nauvoo, were I  before any good tribunal I should be  discharged. But befor I will bear this  unhallowed persecution any longer I will  spill my blood their is a time when bearing  it longer is a sin. I will not bear it longer  I will spil the last drop of blood I have and  all that will not bear it longer say AH. And  the cry of AH rung throughout the Congrega- tion we must stop paying the lawyiers money  for I have learned they dont know any thing  for I know more than they all. Whosoever  believeth that there is power in the Charters  of Nauvoo shall be saved he that believeth not  shall not come here. If a lawyer shall say  their is more power in other places and Charters  than in Nauvoo believeth it not I have converted  this Canditate for congres Mr Walker I  suppose when I see him Converted I will  vote for him and not before I have been with  these lawyers and they have treated me well  But I am here in Nauvoo and the Missourian to   ENDENTRY and when they will get out I dont know perhaps  when some others may. However you may  feel about the high hand of oppression, I wish you to restrain your hand from violence  ^against these men who arestd me^  My word is at stake a hair of their heads shall  not be harmed. My life is pledged to carry out this  great work. I know how readily you are to do right you have done great things and manifested your love  in flying to my assistance on this occasion. I  could not have done better myself, and I bless  you in the name of the Lord with all Blessings  may you not have to suffer as you have here- tofore. I know the Almighty will bless all good men he will bless you: and the time has come when  their shall be such a flocking to the Standard  of Liberty as never has been, nor never shal be  hereafter. what an erie of things has commenced  Shall the Prophecys be esstablished by the Swords  Shall we allways bear, NO. Will not the State  of Missouri stay her hand in her unhallowed  persecutions against the Saints; if not, I  restrain you not any longer; I say in the name  of Jesus Christ I this day turn the key FIGURE that  opens the heavens to restrain you no longer from  this time forth. I will lead you to battle and if  you are not afraid to die and feel disposed to spill  your Blood in your own defence you will not  offend me. Be not the aggressor bear untill they  strike on the one cheek offer the other and they  will be sure to strike that, then defend yourselves  and God shall bear you off. Will any part ot  Illinois say we shall not have our rights treat them  as strangers and not friends and let them go to Hell  Say some we will mob you, mob and be damed. if  I am under the necssity of giving up our charted ENDENTRY rights, privileges and freedom which our fathers  fought bled and died for and which the Constitution  of the United States and and this State garrentee  unto us, I will do it at the point of the  Bayonet and sword. Many Lawyiers contend  for those thing which are against the rights of  men and I can ownly excuse them because of their  ignorance. Go forth and Advocate the laws and  rights of the people ye lawyiers if not dont get  into my hands or under the lash of my tongue Lawyiers say the powers of the Nauvoo Charters  are dangerous. But I ask is the Constitution of  the United States or of this State dangerous, No  neither are the charters granted unto Nauvoo by the legislator of Illinois dangerous, and those that  say they are are fools. We have not our  rights those which the Constitution of the  U.S.A. grant, and which our Charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested, Missouri  and all wicked men will raise the hugh and cry against us and are not satisfyed. But how  are you going to help yourselves what will  mobocrats do in the midst of this people, If  mobs come upon you any more here, dung  your gardings with them. But says one you  will get up excitement we will get up no excitement  except what we can find an escape from  We will rise up Washington like and break off  the wait that bears us down and we will not  be mobed.  To give you an account  of my Journey, I will give you an anecdote that  may be pleasing. A few days before I was taken  I rode with my wife through a Neighborhood to  visit some friends and I said to Mrs Smith here  is a good people I felt this by the spirit of God ENDENTRY the next day I was in their hands a prisioner  with Wilson who said as he drove up  ha, ha ha By God we have got the prophet, he  gloried much in it, But he is now our prisioner When Carthage  came to take me the first salutation was (instead  of taping me on the sho^u^lder and saying you are my prision er) with two cocked pistols to my head God damn  you I will shoot you I will shoot you God damn you  I will shoot you nearly 50 times first and last I asked  them what they wanted to shoot me for, if you  make any resistance. O vary well says I I  have no resistance to make they then dragged  me away and while on the road I asked them by  what authority they did these things they said  by a writ from the Govornors of Missouri and Illinois I then told them I wanted a writ of Habeas  Corpus, the reply was God damn you you shant  have it; I told a man to Go to Dixon and get me a  writ of Habeas Corpus the reply was by  Willson God dam you you shant have it I will  shoot you, I sent for a lawyier to come one  came and Reynolds shut the door in his face and would  not let me speak to him and said again God damn  you I will shoot you I turned to him opened my  bosom and told him to shoot away and I did it freeq- uently, I told Mr Reynolds that I would have  Council to speak to and the Lawyers came to me  and I got a writ of Habeas Corpus for myself and got  a writ for Reynolds and Wilson for unlawful  procedings towards me and cruel treatment they  could not get out of town that night, I pleged my  honor to my council that the Nauvoo Charter had  power to investigate the subject and we came to  Nauvoo by common consent and I am now ENDENTRY June 30 a prisioner of higher authority yes higher  Authority before yourselves. The Charter  expressly says that the City Council shall have  power to enact all laws for the benefit and  convenience of said City not contrary to  the Constitutions of the United States or  of this State and the City ordinance says the  Municipal Court shall have power to give writs  of Habeas Corpus arising under the ordinances  of the City; Their is nothing but what we  have power over excepted restricted by  the Constitution of the United States or  of this state. It is in accordance wih the  Constitution of the U.S.A. But says the mob  what dangerous powers, But the Constitution  of the United nor of this State is not danger ous against good men, but bad men the  breakers of the law so with the laws of  the country and so with the laws of Nauvoo they  are dangerous to mobs but not good men that wish to keep the law. We do not go out of  Nauvoo to disturb any body or any city towon  or place why need they be troubled about  us let them not meddle with our affairs but  let us alone. After we have been deprived  of our rights and privileges as citizenship driven  from town to town place to place state  to state, with the sacrifice of our homes and  lands and our blood been shed and many murde red and all this becaus of our religion, because  we worship Almighty God according to the  dictates of our own consience shall we longer  bear these cruelties which have been heaped  upon us for the last ten years in the face  of heaven and in open open violation of ENDENTRY the Constitution and laws of these United States  and of this I will not bear  it, if they take away my rights I will fights,  for my rights, manfully and Righteously untill  I am used up with Blood and thunder sword and  pistol. We have done nothing against law or right As touching our City Charter and laws their is a  secret in it, what is it our laws go behind  the writ and investigate the subject ie of Habeas  Corpus while other laws do not go behind the  writ you speak of Lawyiers, I am a Lawyier  to But the Almighty God has taught me the prin- ciple of law and the true meaning of the writ of Habes  Corpus is to defend the Innocent and investigat the  subject go behind the writ and if the form of a writ  is wright that is issued against an innocent  man He should not be dragged to another  state and there put to death or in jeaperdy life  or limb because of prejudice when he is innocent  the benefits of the Constitution and law is for all  alike and the great Eloheem God has given me the  privilege of having the benefits of the Constitution  and the writ of Habeas Corpus and I am bold to ask  for this privilege this day and to ask you to carry  out this privilege principle and all who are in  favor of carrying out this great principle  make it manifest by raising the right hand  and their was a sea of hands a universal vote, here  is truly the committy of the whole.  In speaking  of my Journay to Nauvoo I will relate a circums- tance when Mr Cyrus Walker first came to me they  said I should not speak to any man and they would  shoot any man that should speak to me. An old  man came up and said I should have Council and  said he was not afraid of their pistols and they took ENDENTRY him, and I had an opportunity to have  killed him but I had no temptation to do it to  him nor any other man, my worst enemy not  even Boggs in fact he would have more hell  to live in the reflection of his past life than to  die. My freedom commenced from the time  the old man came to me and would talk to me we came direct from Nauvoo we got our writ directed to the nearest  court having authority to try try the case and  we came to Nauvoo. It did my soul good to  see your feelings and love manifest towards me I thank God that I have the honor to lead so  virtuous and honest a people to be your leader and  lawyier as Moses to the children of Israel Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah  to the name of the Most High God I commend  you to his grace and may the Blessings of heaven  rest upon you in the name of Jesus Christ Amen  Furthermore if Missouri continues her warfare  and continues to issue her writs against me and this peopl unlawfully and unjustly as they have done and our  rights are trampled upon and they under take to take  away my wrights I sware with uplifted hands to  Heaven I will spill my blood in its defence they  shall not take away our rights and if they dont  stop leading me by the nose I will lead them by  the nose and if they dont let me alone I will turn  up the world I will make war, when we shake  our own bushes we want to ketch our own fruit The Lawyiers themselves acknowledge that we  have all power granted us in our Charters that we  could ask for, that we had more power than  any other court in the state for all other Courts were restricted ENDENTRY July 1, 1843 ~ Saturday   July 1st 1843 The Municipal Court opened at  8 oclock AM President Joseph Smith made  some remarks to the lawyiers his Council, as he was  a prisioner before the Court. President Joseph Smith  then called upon Brigham Young  Sidney Rigdon who  were duly sworn and gave in their testimony, which  occupied most of the day they went through the  whole scene of the persecution from Jackson  County to the time of their expulsion from the  State by force of Armes and it was certainly  the most heart rending seene or rehearsal of it that  ever saluted the ears of any tribunal in a cifilized  government it would have disgraced an arab or  Hotentot, not ownly theft, Arson, Burgalry, prisons  chains, expulsion rape and Murder were practiced  upon the saints without any redress but even  President Joseph Smith with his companions in  prision loaded with chains were FED with nothing  for FIVE Days in succession but the Flesh of their  OWN BRETHREN which was actaully cooked and  given to them to eat and while hearing this part of the  testimony my blood boiled within and the spirit of war   ENDENTRY rested upon me for the space of two days. The  Lawyiers were shocked to the soul each one made  a speach at the close of the testimony and they exhort'd  us to stand for our rights stand or fall sink or  swim live or die the whole testimony will  be published to the world in pamphlet form and  probably other wise and will stand as a history to  future generations of the unparelled persecution  of the State of Missouri against the Saints of  the last days    ENDENTRY July 2, 1843 ~ Sunday    July 2nd Sunday met at the grove near the temple  A large congregation assembled and was addressed  in an interesting manner by Elder O Hyde  from the 3 ch of the Epistle of John the Divine  2, 3 and 4 verses and said much to the edifycation  of the people. After elder Hyde closed, Mr Walker  and three other Lawyers spoke in rotation and upheld  President Joseph Smith in his procedings and spoke  of the unlawful conduct of his enemies    ENDENTRY July 3, 1843 ~ Monday   July 3rd A special conference of elders was called  and one or two appointed to go to each County in the  State of Illinois. An address was deliverd to the  Elders By President Rigdon who made some  useful remarks among others he said all that  greatness consisted in, in public speaking with any  man was in delivering a chain of Ideas that the  man had well matured speaking of things that  he knew and not of things that he did not know  for should he speak of things he does not know he would set a trap to be caught in, but when  a person understands the subject thorougholy upon  which he is speaking he knows how to defend it This is all the greatest man on earth can do is to   ENDENTRY tell the truth and speak of things he knows.  The Elders were also addressed by Elder B Young    ENDENTRY July 4, 1843 ~ Tuesday   JULY 4th 1843  FIGURE As the Romans took particular notice of any  singular event as ominous of Good or evil so I  will record a small circumstance that took place  in my house this morning. Soon after I arose  in the morning on this 4th Day of July my  wword while hanging in its usual place unsheathed  of itself and the scabbard droped upon the  floor leaving the bear blade suspended from the  peg upon which it hung  As this is the 4th we call it a happy day for  Nauvoo. At a vary early hour people began to  assemble at the grove and at 11 oclock near 13,000  thousand persons had congregated, who were  addressed in a vary able and appropriat  manner by Elder Orson Hyde lately from  Palestine, and who has recently been appointed  on a mission to St Petersburgh, Russia. A  constant accession of numbers swelled the  congregation to 15,000 as near as could be estimated  and at 2 oclock they were again addressed by  Elder Parley P. Pratt in a masterly discourse  followed by President Joseph Smith upon  the subject of the late arest and persecution  who clearly vindicated his innocence and  showed the corruption of his pursueers in  a tru light. Three steamers arived in the  afternoon—one from St Louis one from  Burlington—bringing altogether   ENDENTRY about 900 visiting ladies and gentlemen  to our City. On the arival of each boat they  were escorted to the stand by the Nauvoo  band and the escort companies whare convenient  seats were provided and whare they were  welcomed by the firing of cannon which brought  to our minds the last words of the patriot  Jefferson:- -Let this day be celebrated by the  firing of cannon andc. The legion was not  out.  The following is a  synopsis of the Address of President Joseph Smith  while speaking in his own defence before about  15,000 souls  If the people will give ear a moment  I will address them, with few words in my own  defence as touching my arest. In the first  place I will state to these that can hear me  that I never spent more than six months  in Missouri except while in prison, while I  was there I was at work for the support of  my family. I never was a prisioner of war  during my stay for I had not made war, I  never took a pistol a gun, or sword and the much  that has been said on this subject is false I  have been willing to go before any governor  Judge or tribunal whare justice could be done  and have the subject investigated. I could not  have committee treason in that state while  there I had no controll any whare in temporal  things while there but in spiritual I was  driven from that state by force of  arms under the exterminating order of  Govornor Boggs. I have never commited  treason the people know vary well I   ENDENTRY have Been a peaceable citizen but  their has been a great hugh and cry about  Jo Smith Govornor Bogs being shot, No  crime can be done but what it is laid to  Jo Smith. Here I was again dragged to  the United States court, and was cleared  and now it comes again. But as often as  God sees fit for me to suffer I am ready  But I am as innocent of these crimes as the  Angels in heaven.  I am not an enemy to manki- nd I am a friend to Mankind. I ^am^ not an enemy  to Missouri nor any any governors or people  As to the military station I hold and the cause  of my holding it is as follows. When we came  here the State required us to bear arms and do  military duty according to law, and as the Church  had just been driven from the State of Missou- ri and robed of all their property and arms they were  poor and destitute of armes: they were liable  to be fined for not doing duty when they had not  arms to do it with, they came to me for advice  I advised them to organize themselves into inde- pendant companies, and demand arms of the  State, this they did. Again their were many  Elders having licence to preach which by law  exhonorated them from Military duty but the  officiers would not release them on this ground  I then told the saints that though I was clear  from Military duty by law in consequence  of lameness in one of my legs, yet I would  set them the example and would do duty my- self, they then said they were willing to do duty  if they could be formed into an independant  company and I could be at their head and upon  this ground came the Nauvoo Legion and I   ENDENTRY holding the office of Lieutenant General  not that I seek for power. and with regard  to elections some say we all vote together and  we vote as I say: But I never tell any man how to vote  or who to vote for. But I will show you how  we have been situated by bringing a comparison  Should their be a Methodist society here and  two candidates running for office: one says  if you will vote for me and put me in governor  I will exterminate the Methodist take away their  Charters andc. The other Candidate says if I am  Govornor I will give all an equal privilege, which  would the Methodist vote for, of course they would  vote in mass for the candidate that would give  them their rights; thus it has been with us  Joseps Duncon said if the people would elect  him he would exterminate the mormons and take  away their Charters. As to Mr Ford he made no  such threats, but manifested a spirit in his spea- ches to give every man their rights; hence the  Church universally voted for mr Ford and  he was elected govornor; But he has  issued writs against me the first time the  Missourians made a demand for me and this is  the second one he has issued for me which has  caused me much trouble and expense. President  Smith also rehearsed the account of his being  taken By Wilson and the unlawful  treatment he received at their hands  The multitute gave good attention  and much prejudice seemed to be removed   ENDENTRY July 5, 1843 ~ Wednesday   July 5th My masons got together to comme nce laying brick on my house but our door and  window frames not being made part of them went home but some staid but performed but  little work  ENDENTRY July 6, 1843 ~ Thursday   6th I had an interview with Br Fidoe who has  taken a job of Building my house he informed  the fraims were not yet made and thought it  best to dismiiss the masons for a season we did so  and I prepaired myself in the afternoon to start on  my mission for the east next morning got my  trunk and things ready andc and sent them up to A  Morrisons landing andc FIGURE  ENDENTRY July 7, 1843 ~ Friday   July 7th I arose early in the morning laid hands  upon Mrs Woodruff and Blessed her and our daughter  Morrison  landing and spent most of the day at Br L.

After tea we walked to meeting in a hall in Washington St opposite Boydston hall Elder Hyde had advertised to Preach upon the murder of Hyram Smith and take up a collection at the close to pay his expenses home.   The following is a brief synopsis of the same The speaker read the 24 ch Matthew 9 to 14 verses as the foundation of some remarks. Said he would much rather leave the strife of men, and spend his time in speaking of the gospel of Jesus Christ But it is my design to night to speak upon the death of the Prophet and Patriarch. Some might think because of the death of the men it would put a stop to the  work but not so, when God has sent a men at any time they were opposed by the world, for any gener- ation, that has a prophet of God in their midst they see his weakness as touching human nature and the people are watching for iniquity and they spend all their time talking about any thing they see him do that does not accord with their traditions and tell a great many falshoods about him but entirely forget and overlook all the good he does. It was   ENDENTRY so with our Savior men looked upon him as an impostor and Beelzebub the Prince of devils, and when he was crucifyed they were not satisfyed with his dying merely but went and thrust a spear into his side and their came out Blood and water. But how is it now with the Savior, all profess to believe on him they dont talk about what his persecutors said were his bad deeds but his good ones. whan a man dies his bad deeds die with him and his virtues live and grow brighter. The gentiles say if I had lived in the days of the Savior I would not have killed him but would have rejoiced. But imagin yourselfs living in the days of the an inspired man how would you look upon him, as the worst of men the same as they did. A man told me he dreamed that some man spoke to him and said Lama, Lama, and he looked and it was Joseph Smith retreating from him and saying those words, the interpetation of which is my God my God and when Joseph Smith was shot he repeated those words. So with the Savior when he was crucified he said Lama, Lama, Sabaethana. As the Jews were not satisfied with killing Jesus Christ, but must thrust a spear into his side so with the gentiles they were not satisfied with shooting the Prophet but stabed him with a dagger in the breast, as soon as they killed them they all fled and in an hour their was not a man left in the place, but the wicked flea when no man persues, but why did the people murder this Prophet what were they afraid of. O if he lives he will take away our power of goverment get the rule in his own hands and we will be distroyed, but they were mistaken. If they had let him alone or had recie- ved him he would have saved the nation from ruin and destruction.

Clouds of a white and fleecy appearance  were at the time floating in the atmosphere,  but so thin as not to entirely obscure the blue  sky the wind blue vary gently from the west  by northwest. The cold being intense essp- ecially for the time of year and small crysta- ls of ice or snow were visible s floating in the air The following diagram represents these beau- tiful phenomena as they appeared about half  past seven oclock A.M. The magnitudes of the  circles given in the following decription may not  be exact as I was destitute of the proper inst ruments for their accurate measurement.

Its breadth  and colours were about the  same as that of a common  rainbow nearly all the prismatic colours   ENDENTRY were discernible the red being on the concave part of the circle next to the sun. On each  side of the sun at a and b towards the north  and south there were two mock suns of  different colours vary splendid and bright  in their appearance.   2nd The sun was  encircled by another halo, k n i m, much  larger than the former, and parellel to it  being nearly 90° in diameter and its lower  limb being sunk below the horizen about  27°. It exhibited the same colours as the  first though not so bright. ^3rd^ At the top of  these circles at e and i, were two inverted  arches whose common centre seemed  to lay in the Zenith. The upper arch f i h  was exeedingly brilliant and beautifully  coloured and appeared to be about  54° degrees in diameter and that of the  lower one d c e about 99°. Annother  Parhelion or mock sun appeared in the  middle of the lower arch, at c whare it  coincided with the circle first described  but its colours and brightness were much  inferior to those of the collateral mock  suns at a and b.   4th There appeared  a circle in b s a n t r, much larger  than any I have yet described being  about 144° in diameter and of a uniform  whiteness. It was about 18 degrees above  the horizen, and parallel to it passing through  the tru sun, s, and the collateral parhelia  a, and b and also through two other  parhelia, t and r, sumthing about  90 or 100° from the sun one towards  the north and the other towards the south.

P. Pratt. After reading the letter he  addressed the assembly in a vary feeling  interesting and edefying manner among  many other remarks he said he should  have been more reconciled to the death of Elder  barnes could his bodey have been laid in  the grave in Nauvoo or among the saints, he  said he had vary peculiar feelings relative  to recieving an honorable burial with his fathers  he considered Nauvoo would be a burying  place of the saints and should he die he considered  it would be a great blessing to be buried with  the saints and esspecially to be buried with his father  yes he wanted to lie by the side of his father  that when the trump of God should sound  and the voice of God should say ye saints  arise, that when the tomb should birst he  could arise from the grave and first salute  his father and say O my father, and his father  say O my Son!! as they took each other by  the heand he wished next to salute his brothers  and sisters and then the Saints and he said it was  upon this principle that the ancients were  so particular to have an honorable burial with  their fathers as in the case of Joseph, before his  death he made his kindred promise to carry   ENDENTRY his bones to the land of Canann and they did  so they embalmed his body took it to the land  of Canaan and buryed it with his fathers  their is a glory in this that many do not  comprehend. It is true that in the  resurrrection that the bodies will be caught  up to meet the Lord and the saints will all be  brought together though they were scattered  upon the face of the whole earth yet they  would not as readily salute each other as  though they lay down and rose up together  from the same bed. To bring it to the under- standing it would be upon the same principle  as though two who were vary friends indeed  should lie down upon the same bed at night  locked in each other embrace talking of their  love and should awake in the morning together  they could immediately renew their  conversation of love even while risings from  their bed but if they were alone and in  seperate apartments they could not as  readily salute each other as though they  were together. He remarked that should  he live and have an opportunity of gathering  his friends who had died together he intended  to do it but if he should not live to do  it himself he hoped that some of his frie friends would. He wished all of the  saints to be comforted with the victory  they were to gain by the resurrection  it is sufficient to encorage the saint to  overcome in the midst of evry trial trouble  and tribulation though thunders roar and earth quakes bellow, lightnings flash and wars are  upon evry hand yet suffer not a joint  to tremble nor let not your heart faint   ENDENTRY for the great Eloheem will deliver you  and if not before the resurrection will set you  eternally free from all these things from  pain sorrow and death.

He then read the  second epistle of Peter 1st ch 16 to last vers  and dwelt upon the 19: vers with som remarks  add to your faith knowledge andc. The principle  of knowledge is the principle of Salvation  the Principle can be comprehended, for  any one that cannot get knowledge to be  saved will be damned. The Principl of  Salvation is given to us through the kno- wledge of Jesus Christ. Salvation is  nothing more or less than to triumph over  all our enemies and put them under our feet  and when we have power to put all enemies under  our feet in this world and a knowledge to triumph  over all evil spirits in the world to come then  we are saved as in the case of Jesus he was  to reign untill he had put all enemies under  his feet and the last enemy was death    perhaps there are principle here that few  men have thought of. No power ^person^ can have  this Salvation except through a tabernacle   ENDENTRY Now in this world mankind are naturly  selfish, ambitious and striving to excell one  above another while yet some are willing  to build up others as well as themselves so in  the other world their is a variety of spirits  some who seek to excell, and this was the  case with the devil when he fell he sought  for things which were unlawful hence he was  cast down and it is said he drew away many  with him and the greatness of his punishment  is that he shall not have a tabernacle this  is his punishment. So the devil thinking to  thwart the decree of God by going up and down  in the earth seeking whome he may destroy  any person that he can find that will yield to  him he will bind ^him^ and take possession of the  body and reign there glorying in it mightily not  thinking that he had got a stolen tabernacle and by and by some one of Authority will come  along and cast him out and restore the tabernacle  to his rightful owner but the bevil steals  a tabernacle because he has not one of his own  but if he steals one he is liable to be turned out  of doors   Now their is some grand secrett here  and keys to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding  the Apostle exhorts them to make their calling  add to their faith virtue, knowledge temperance  andc yet he exhorts them to make their calling  and election shure and though they had herd the  audible voice from heaven bearing testimony  that Jesus was the son of God yet he says  we have a more sure word of Prophecy whare  unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a  light shining in a dark place. Now wharein  could they have a more sure word of prophecy   ENDENTRY on the flat would beet the saints on the Hill Great God how such a thing looks that the saints should be afraid of beating one another in the election or being beat I would ask who built up this city would steem boats landed here if the saints had not come, or could you even the speculators have soled their lands for any thing here if the saints had not come they might have sold for a few bare and wolf skins but not for money, can these speculaters sell all their land to the saints for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhare els I tell you nay, for know it ye people that Israel is here and they are the head and not the tail and the people must learn it all those who have gone from us have gone from the head to the tail. But if any of you wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up butter it both sides and then it will fall butter side up. Uppose this work and it will roll over you, when did this work ever stop since it began never. The ownly thing the saints now want to know is what does the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Well then build the temple of the Lord keep the law of God ye saints and the hypocritt and Scroundral will flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of God will be two hot for them, he made many important remarks.   Elder Taylor followed with an address upon political matters he traced the history of governments for many centuries and traced the form of governments from ancient days to the present time He spoke of our Charters and General Smith being a candidate for the Presidential chair and we must do what we can to electing him we will not be cowards   ENDENTRY in this thing. A coward is like an Ostrich he will hide his head under cover and leaves his body out in sight to be seen as we pass along so cowards here after will be called an Ostrich. He also made some remarks concerning the building of the Temple. Elder Young remarked that he should visit those who did not pay up their tithing you will want a blessing in the temple when it is done   President Smith remarked in relation to those who give in property for the temple we want it brought to the proper source that it may be put on the Church Book So that in  the endowment those whose names are on book shall have the prefference. As to politics I care but little about the Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much for the office as I would for the one I now hold, but as the world have used the power of Goverment to oppress and persecute us it is right for us to use it for the protection of our rights. when I get hold of the eastern paper and see how popular I am I am afraid myself that I shall be elected, But if I should be I would not say that your cause is just and I could not do any thing for you. what I said in relation to the annexation of texas is with some unpopular the people are opposed to it. I will take this objection away. the opposition is because it is filled up with slavery, now I wish to turn the argument it is the vary reason why it ought to be received in order to watch over them of the greatest ^two^ evils we should reject the greatest. The president of Texas sayes if you do not receive us in the United States we will go to the British this would certainly be bad policy for this Nation the British are now through out that whole country trying to bribe all they can. How much better it is to be to a little expens   ENDENTRY than to have the indians and British upon us and destroy us all. we should grasp all the territory we can and I know, much that I do not tell I have had bribes offered me, but I have rejected them. The government will not receive any thing from me they are self sufficient, but they must go to Hell and work out their own salvation with fear and trembling as soon as texas was annexed I would liberate two or three states and pay them for their slaves and let them go to blacks andc I would also receive Canida and stand by them and many other usful remarks He made A collection was taken up to buy powder and fuse rope about $60 dollars was recieved. meeting closed and we returned to our homes    ENDENTRY March 8, 1844 ~ Friday   March 8th I laboured in the garden or banking up my house I met in council in the evening with the presidency and twelve. spoke concerning a candidate for the vice Presidency they had nominated Gen Arlington Bennet not knowing that he was a native of Ireland. the final decision was for me to write to Col Solomon Copeland to invite him to visit us and see if he would suffer his name to run for the vice Presidency    ENDENTRY March 9, 1844 ~ Saturday   9th FIGURE I spent the day in plowing and making some garding I planted and sowed onions potatoes set out raspburies this is the earliest time I ever undertook to make a garding   ENDENTRY March 10, 1844 ~ Sunday   March 10th 1844 Sunday FIGURES I mailed a letter to Sister Sarah B. Foss and wrote one letter to Col King Follet was buried this day under Masonic honors he was killed while in a well by having a bucket of stone fall onto him   A large assembly of the saints met at the temple and was addressed by President Joseph Smith upon one of the most important and interesting subjects ever presented to the saints and the principles presented were of the greatest importance to be understood it was as follows the work and calling and spirit Mesiah. The following is a synopsis of the discourse   Their is a differance between the spirit and office of Elias and Elijah it is the spirit of Elias I wish first to speak of. And in order to come at the subject I will bring some of the testimony from the scripture and give my own, in the first place suffice it to say I went into the woods to inq wire of the Lord by prayer his will concern- ing me, and I saw an angel and he laid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be a priest after the order of keys of this priesthood which office was to preach repentance and Baptism for the remission of Sins and also to baptise but was informed that this office did not extend to the laying on of hands for the giving of the Holy Ghost that that office was a greater work and was to be given afterwards but that my ordination was a preparetory work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way for the greater, which was the case with John the Baptist he came balling through the wilderness prepare ye the   ##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-70## ENDENTRY way of the Lord and make his paths strait and they were informed if they could receive it it was the spirit of Elias and John was vary particular to tell the people he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light. ##John 1:6-9## He told the people that his mission was to preach repentane and baptize with water, but it was he that should come after him that should baptise with fire and the Holy Ghost ##Matthew 3:11## if he had been an imposture he might have gone to work beyound, his bounds and undertook to have performed ordinances that did not belong to that office and calling under the spirit of Elias. The spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater revelation of God which is the priesthood of Elias or the Priesthood of Aaron was ordained unto. And when God sends a man into the world to prepare for a greater work holds the keys of the power of Elias it was called the doctrin of Elias even from the early ages of the world. John's mission was limited to preaching and baptizing but what he done was legal and when Jesus Christ came to any of John's deciples he baptized them with fire and the Holy Ghost. We find the Apostles endowed with greater power than John their office was more under the spirit and power of  Elijah than Elias. In the case of Philip when he went down to Samaria was under the spirit of Elias he baptized both men and women, when Peter and John herd of it they went down and lade hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost this shows the distinction between the two powers. ##Acts 8:12-17## when Paul came to certain deciples he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost they said no, who baptized you then we were baptized unto Johns Baptism   ##Acts 19:1-6## ENDENTRY No John did not baptized you for he did  his work right, and so Paul went and baptized them  for he knew what the true doctrin was and he  knew that John had not Baptised them, and these  principles and is strange to me that men who have  red the scriptures of the New Testament are so  far from it. What I want to impress upon your  minds is the difference of power in the different  parts of the Priesthood, so that when any man  comes among you saying I have the spirit of Elias  you can know whether he be true or fals, for  any man that comes having the spirit and power of  Elias he will not transend his bounds. John  did not transend his bound but faithfully performed  that part belonging to his office, and evry portion  of the great building should be prepared right and  assigned to its proper place, and it is necessary  to know who holds the keys of power and who  dont, or we may be likely to be decieved. That  person who holds the keys of Elias hath a prep- aritory work, But if I spend much more  time in conversing about the spirit of Elias I  shall not have time to do justice to the spirit and  power of Elijah, this is the Elias spoken of in the last days and here is the rock upon which many  split thinking the time was past in the days of  John and Christ and no more to be, but the spirit of  Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefore  I speak with boldness for I know varily my doctrin  is true. Now for Elijah, the spirit power and  calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the keys  of the revelations ordinances, oricles powers and endow- ments of the fulness of the Melchezedek Priesthood  and of the kingdom of God on the Earth and to recieve,  obtain and perform all the ordinances belonging to the  kingdom of God even unto the sealing of the hearts   ENDENTRY of the hearts fathers unto the Children and the hearts  of the children unto the fathers even those who are  in heaven. Malachi says I will send Elijah befor  the great and dredful day of the Lord come and He  shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children  and the hearts of the Children to the Fathers lest I  come and smite the earth with a curse. Now what I  am after is the knowledge of God and I take my own  course to obtain it, what are we to under^stand^ by this  in the last days, in the days of Noah God destroyed  the world by a flood and has promised to destroy  it by fire in the last days but before it took place  Elijah should first come and turn the hearts of  the Fathers to the children andc. now comes the  point what is this office and work of Elijah, it is  one of the greatest and most important subjects that  God has revealed, he should send Elijah to seal the  children to the fathers and fathers to the children, now  was this merely confined to the living to settle diffic- ulties with families on earth, by no means, it was a  far greater work Elijah what would you do if you  was here? would you confine ^refer^ ^confine^ your work to the  living alone. No. I would confine ^refer^ you to the  scriptures whare the subject is manifest, ie without  us they could not be made perfect nor we  without them, the fathers without the children  nor the children without the fathers. I wish  you to understand this subject for it is important  and if you will recieve it this is the spirit of Elijah  that we redeem our dead and connect ourselves  with our fathers which are in heaven and seal  up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection  and here we want the power of Elijah to seal  those who dwell on earth to those which dwell  in heaven this is the power of Elijah and the keys   ENDENTRY of the kingdom of Jehovah. Let us suppose  a case. suppose the great God who dwells in heaven  should reveal himself to Father Cutler here  by the opening heavens and tell him I offer  up a decree that whatsoever you seal on earth  with your decree I will seal it in heaven, you have  power then, can it be taken of? No. Then what  you seal on earth by the keys of Elijah is sealed in  heaven and this is the power of Elijah, and this is  the difference between the spirit and power of Elias  and Elijah for while the spirit of Elias is a fore  runner the power of Elijah is sufficient to make  our Calling and Election sure and the same doctrin  whare we are exhorted to go on on to perfection not  laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands, resurrection  of the dead andc we cannot be perfect without the  fathers, andc we must have revelations then  and we can see that the doctrin of revelation  as far transcends the doctrin of no revelation as  knowlede is above ignorance for one truth revealed  from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in  exhistance. This spirit of Elijah was manifest in  the days of the apostles in delivering certain ones  to the buffitings of Satan that they may be saved in  the day of the Lord Jesus, they were sealed by the  spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of Hell untill the  day of the Lord or revelation of Jesus Christ Here is the doctrin of Election that the world  have quarreled so much about but they do  not know any thing about it. The doctrin  that the Prysbeterians and Methodist have  quarreled so much about once in grace always in  grace, or falling away from grace I will say a word  about, they are both wrong, truth takes a road  between them both. for while the Presbyterian  says once in grace you cannot fall the   ENDENTRY Methodist says you can have grace to day, fall  from it to morrow, next day have grace again and so  follow it, but the doctrin of the scriptures and the  spirit of Elijah would show them both fals and  take a road between them both for according to the  scriptures if a man has receive the good word of  God and tasted of the powers of the world to come if  they shall fall away it is impossible to renew them  again, seeing they have crucified the son of God  afresh and put him to an open frame shame, so their  is a possibility of falling away you could not be  renewed again, and the power of Elijah cannot  seal against this sin for this is a reserve made  in the seals and power of the priesthood, I will make  evry doctrin plain that I present and it shall stand  upon a firm bases And I am at the defiance of  the world for I will take shelter under the  broad shelter ^cover^ of the wings of the work in which  I am ingaged, it matters not to me if all hell boils  over I regard it ownly as I would the crackling  of thorns under a pot. A murderer, for instance  one that sheds innocent blood cannot have  forgiveness. David sought repentance at the hand  of God carefully with tears but he could ownly  get it through Hell. he got a promise that his  soul should not be left in Hell. Although David  was a king he never did obtain the spirit and power  of Elijah and the fulness of the Priesthood, and the  priesthood that he received and the throne and kingdom  of David is to be taken from him and given to another  by the name of David in the last days raised up  out of his linage. Peter refered to the same  subject on the day of pentecost, but the multi- tude did not get the endowment that Peter had  but several days after the people asked what shall   ENDENTRY we do. Peter says I would ye had done it ignorantly  speaking of crucifying the Lord andc He did not say  to them repent and be baptized for the remission  of your sins but he said repent therefore and be  converted that your sins may be blotted out when the  times of refreshing shall come from the presence  of the Lord. Acts III, 19 this is the case with murderers they could not be baptized for the remission  of sins for they had shed innocent Blood.    Again the doctrin or sealing power of Elijah is  as follows if you have power to seal on earth and in  heaven then we should be crafty, the first  thing you do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters  unto yourself and yourself unto your fathers in  eternal glory, and go ahead and not go back, but  use a little craftiness and seal all you can and when  you get to heaven tell your father that what  you seal on earth should be sealed in heaven I will walk through the gate of heaven and claim  what I seal and those that follow me and my council The Lord once told me that what I asked for  I should have. I have been afraid to aske to  ask God to kill my enemies lest some of them  should peradventure should repent. I asked a  short time since for the Lord to deliver me  out of the hands of the govornor of Missouri and if it must needs be to accomplish it to take  him away and the next news that came pouring  down from their was Govornor Reynolds had  shot himself, and I would now say beware O earth  how you fight against the saints of God and shed innocent  blood, for in the days of Elijah his enemies came  upon him and fire was called down from heaven  and destroyed them, the spirit of Elias is first,  Elijah second, and Mesiah last. Elias is a fore runner  to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of Elijah   ENDENTRY is to come after holding the keys of power building  the Temple to the cap stone, placing the seals of  the Melchezedeck priesthood up on the house of Israel  and making all things ready then Mesiah comes to  his Temple which is last of all. Mesiah is above  the spirit and power of Elijah for he made the world  and was that spiritual rock unto Moses in the  wilderness. Elijah was to come and prepare the way  and build up the kingdom before the coming of  the great day of the Lord. Although the spirit of  Elias might begin it, I have asked of the  Lord concerning his Coming and while asking, the  Lord gave me a sign and said in the days of Noah  I set a bow in the heavens as a sign and token that  in any year that the bow should be seen the Lord  would not come, but their should be seed time and harvest during that year, but whenever you  see the bow withdraw it shall be a token that their  shall be famin pestilence and great distress among  the nations. But I take the responsibility upon  myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord, that  Christ will not come this year as Miller has  prophecyed, for we have seen the bow. And  I also Prophecy in the name of the Lord that  Christ will not Come in forty years and  if God ever spake by my mouth he will not  come in that length of time, and Jesus Christ  never did reveal to any man the precise time that  he would come, go and read the scriptures and you  cannot find any thing that specifies the exact time he  would come and all that say so are fals teachers.  Their are some important things concerning the  office of the Mesiah in the organization of the  world which I will speak of hereafter. May  God Almighty bless you and pour out his spirit upon you  is the prayer of your unworthy servant Amen   ENDENTRY At the close of the meeting I was informed my son Benbows was vary sick.
