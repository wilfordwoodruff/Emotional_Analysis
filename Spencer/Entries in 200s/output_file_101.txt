I spent the night at home with my family, thus it is with me.

ENDENTRY  FIGURE All the authorities of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in and  about Nauvoo met in a special conference  in the grove in Nauvoo at 3 oclock. The quorum of  the Twelve, Councillors A Lyman, the  High Council, and others occupied the Stand, the  High Priest, quorum, &amp; quorum of the Seventies and  Elders, Pishops Priests Teachers &amp; deacons appeared  in their several quorums and took their seats and  also a vast congregation of Saints, when all was  seated that could get seats, President B. Young arose and said Attention all  this congregation makes me think of the days of  king Benjamin when the People was so great that  they could not make them hear, But we want  your attention. W upon to address the throne of grace which he did do  most fervently. President B Young again  arose and said let none complain because of the  situation of the congregation. we have all done the best  we could.     your lives, for the first time in the kingdom of God do I step forth to act in my capacity in connexion  with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles of Jesus  Christ unto the People and to bear of the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world. And for the first time are you called to walk by faith not by sight, for  always before you have had a Prophet as the mouth  of the Lord to speak to you. but he has sealed his  testimony with his Blood. I now want to ask  each of you to tell me if you want to chuse a   ENDENTRY  as your head to lead you all that are in favor of it  make it manifest by raising the right hand. No hands  raised. All that wants to draw away a party from  the church after them let them do it if they can but they will not prosper. I now wish to speak of  the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints; Amasa Lyman were counsellors to Joseph. I ask whare is Joseph he is gone beyound the vail, and for them to act in  their office as his cooncillors they must go beyond  the veil whare he is. Their has been much said about  Presiden Rigdon being president of the Church  leading the People, being the head, &amp;c If the People want President Rigdon to lead them, they may  have him. But I say unto you that the quorum  of The Twelve have the keys of the kingdom  of God in all the world, they stand next to Joseph  and are the Presidency of the Church, and hold  the keys and would have to ordain any man unto  that appointment  was to be chosen. You cannot appoint any man at our head. we should have to ordain him, you cannot  appoint a man at our head, But if you want any  other man to lead you, take him, and we will go  our way to build up the kingdom in all the world.  Perhaps some think that president Rigdon would  not be honored But if he does right he will not act  against our council nor we against his but act together but I repeat again No man can stand at our head.  The Prophet Joseph has lade the foundation for  a great work, and we will build upon it. Do you  want a Patriarch for the whole church it would  have been the right of Samuel Smith if he had  lived, but he is dead John Smith it is their right. Do you want a trustee   ENDENTRY  to attend to temporal matters they never yet have  acted in their station. Elder S. Rigdon  claims to be a spokesman to Joseph, vary well he  is but can he now act in that office if he wants  now to be a spokesman to the prophet, he must go  to the other side of the veil for the Prophet is there But Elder Rigdon is here. why will Elder Rigdon  be a fool. Let those who holds the keys of the  kingdom of God build it up in all the world. If their  is a spokesman if he is a king and Priest let him go  and build up a kingdom this is his right, and it is  the right of many here but who is the head?  the Twelve. if one Thousand rise up and say they  have the Prophets Joseph shoes I know they are impost- ures If you know how the church is organized I  wish to ask a question. Now If you want Rigdon  Law to lead you or any body els, you may  have them, But I tel you in the name of the  Lord, that no man can put another betwen  the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph, why because Joseph was their file leader and he has  committed into there hands the keys of the  kingdom for all the world. dont put a thread  between the Priesthood and God  has stood next to Joseph and Hiram. I have and  I will stand next to him. we have a head, and that head is the Twelve and we can now begin to  see the neccessity of the Apostleship close and give way for my brethren.    words. I am satisfyed with the open frank manner  that Elder Young has addressed this assembly.  I ownly take exceptions to my name being associated  with W   ENDENTRY  or means wanted to carry on the work but what  is in the Twelve, the right has been presented  by Elder Young and I will back him up. President  Young has stood next to the Prophet Joseph  with the Twelve and I have stood next to them  and I will still stand next to them. We have  a head here what is that head? the quorum of the Twelve we now se the necessity of  the Apostleship. I might rise up as well as any  other man to ask for the head but I could not  do it without endangering my salvation. But  I will stand unto the Twelve the same as I did  to Joseph either on one side or the other  but not before them. President Rigdon  called upon W. W. Phelps to speak in his  behalf as he could not speak.    had been enough said to Prepare the minds  of the People to act. I have seen the people  submit with defference to the authority of the church. I have seen the People take their lives in their hand and gather subjects for the  kingdom of God. I have seen them prepare  for war and ready to pour out their hearts  Blood, and I am happy to see the same  disposition manifest here today as was when  Joseph and Hiram Smith was brought dead  murdered to this city, then you submitted  to the Law and to God and I see the same  thing today you are ready to submit to the authority of God the Twelve are chosen  to rise up and bear the Church off triumphant I ^have^ feelings about this esspecially for president  Rigdon their is a quorum that the 12 belong to Br Rigdon was brought to the same quorum   ENDENTRY  has gone but he has not left us comfortless, for  he will administer unto us I will bear this testimony in 2 nights after he was slain he came to me (and I thought their was a large building stood on  wheels, and he said tell the drivers to drive on I  asked if the building was on wheels. yes so  we drove all round the hills and valleys and  finally over the river into Iowa.

If you want to  do right uphold the Twelve. If they die I am willing to die with them. But do your duty  and you will be endowed, I will sustain the  Twelve.

If you want Sidney Rigdon  to lead you vote for him but if you dont intend  to follow him, and support him as you did Joseph and I would say the same for the Twelve  dont make a covenant to support them unless  you intend to abide by their council. But we  want to know if this people will support the Priesthood If you build the house you will get the endowm- ent. If we do our best and cannot build the  house we will go into the wilderness and get  it. will you take our council. The first is  do you want President Rigdon to be the head  or do the Saints want the Twelve to Stand as  the head. the first Presidency of the church  and at the head of this Kingdom in all the  world, stand next to Joseph, walk up into  their calling, hold the Keys of this Kingdom All that are in favor of this in all the congre- gation of the Saints manifest it by holding  up the right hand. Their was sea of hands  a universal vote, a contrary vote was called  and not a hand was raised in all the con- gregation. Let President Rigdon go and raise  up a mighty kingdom. Our feelings are to let  Marsh stand as the President of this stake.  Joseph has loved this People unto death and  Hiram has loved Joseph and this People unto  death. If the The Twelve had been here  I would not have seen him given up, he should  not have been given up.

We have not our  rights those which the Constitution of the  U.S.A. grant, &amp; which our Charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested, Missouri  &amp; all wicked men will raise the hugh &amp; cry against us and are not satisfyed. But how  are you going to help yourselves what will  mobocrats do in the midst of this people, If  mobs come upon you any more here, dung  your gardings with them. But says one you  will get up excitement we will get up no excitement  except what we can find an escape from  We will rise up Washington like &amp; break off  the wait that bears us down &amp; we will not  be mobed.   of my Journey, I will give you an anecdote that  may be pleasing. A  I rode with my wife through a Neighborhood to  visit some friends &amp; I said to Mrs Smith here  is a good people I felt this by the spirit of God ENDENTRY  with Wilson who said as he drove up  ha, ha ha By God we have got the prophet, he  gloried much in it, But he is now our prisioner When Carthage  came to take me the first salutation was (instead  of taping me on the sho^u^lder &amp; saying you are my prision er) with two cocked pistols to my head God damn  you I will shoot you I will shoot you God damn you  I will shoot you nearly 50 times first &amp; last I asked  them what they wanted to shoot me for, if you  make any resistance. O vary well says I I  have no resistance to make they then dragged  me away &amp; while on the road I asked them by  what authority they did these things they said  by a writ from the Govornors of Missouri &amp; Illinois I then told them I wanted a writ of Habeas  Corpus, the reply was God damn you you shant  have it; I told a man to Go to Dixon &amp; get me a  writ of Habeas Corpus the reply was by  Willson God dam you you shant have it I will  shoot you, I sent for a lawyier to come one  came &amp; Reynolds shut the door in his face &amp; would  not let me speak to him &amp; said again God damn  you I will shoot you I turned to him opened my  bosom &amp; told him to shoot away &amp; I did it freeq- uently, I told Mr Reynolds that I would have  Council to speak to &amp; the Lawyers came to me  &amp; I got a writ of Habeas Corpus for myself &amp; got  a writ for Reynolds &amp; Wilson for unlawful  procedings towards me &amp; cruel treatment they  could not get out of town that night, I pleged my  honor to my council that the Nauvoo Charter had  power to investigate the subject &amp; we came to  Nauvoo by common consent &amp; I am now ENDENTRY  a prisioner of higher authority yes higher  Authority before yourselves. The Charter  expressly says that the City Council shall have  power to enact all laws for the benefit &amp;  convenience of said City not contrary to  the Constitutions of the United States or  of this State &amp; the City ordinance says the  Municipal Court shall have power to give writs  of Habeas Corpus arising under the ordinances  of the City; Their is nothing but what we  have power over excepte the Constitution of the United States or  of this state. It is in accordance wih the  Constitution of the U.S.A. But says the mob  what dangerous powers, But the Constitution  of the United nor of this State is not danger ous against good men, but bad men the  breakers of the law so with the laws of  the country &amp; so with the laws of Nauvoo they  are dangerous to mobs but not good men that wish to keep the law. We do not go out of  Nauvoo to disturb any body or any city towon  or place why need they be troubled about  us let them not meddle with our affairs but  let us alone. After we have been deprived  of our rights &amp; privileges as citizenship driven  from town to town place to place state  to state, with the sacrifice of our homes &amp;  lands &amp; our blood been shed &amp; many murde red &amp; all this becaus of our religion, because  we worship Almighty God according to the  dictates of our own consience shall we longer  bear these cruelties which have been heaped  upon us for the last ten years in the face  of heaven &amp; in open open violation of ENDENTRY  &amp; of this I will not bear  it, if they take away my rights I will fights,  for my rights, manfully &amp; Righteously untill  I am used up with Blood &amp; thunder sword &amp;  pistol. We have done nothing against law or right As touching our City Charter &amp; laws their is a  secret in it, what is it our laws go behind  the writ &amp; investigate the subject ie of Habeas  Corpus while other laws do not go behind the  writ you speak of Lawyiers, I am a Lawyier  to But the Almighty God has taught me the prin- ciple of law &amp; the true meaning of the writ of Habes  Corpus is to defend the Innocent &amp; investigat the  subject go behind the writ &amp; if the form of a writ  is wright that is issued against an innocent  man He should not be dragged to another  state &amp; there put to death or in jeaperdy life  or limb because of prejudice when he is innocent  the benefits of the Constitution &amp; law is for all  alike &amp; the great E privilege of having the benefits of the Constitution  &amp; the writ of Habeas Corpus &amp; I am bold to ask  for this privilege this day &amp; to ask you to carry  out this  favor of carrying out this great principle  make it manifest by raising the right hand  &amp; their was a sea of hands a universal vote, here  is truly the committy of the whole.  In speaking  of my Journay to Nauvoo I will relate a circums- tance when Mr Cyrus Walker first came to me they  said I should not speak to any man &amp; they would  shoot any man that should speak to me. An old  man came up &amp; said I should have Council &amp;  said he was not afraid of their pistols &amp; they took ENDENTRY  killed him but I had no temptation to do it to  him nor any other man, my worst enemy not  even Boggs in fact he would have more hell  to live in the reflection of his past life than to  die. My freedom commenced from the time  the old man came to me &amp; would talk to me we came direct from Nauvoo we got our writ directed to the nearest  court having authority to try try the case &amp;  we came to Nauvoo. It did my soul good to  see your feelings &amp; love manifest towards me I thank God that I have the honor to lead so  virtuous &amp; honest a people to be your leader &amp;  lawyier as Moses to the children of Israel Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah  to the name of the Most High God I commend  you to his grace &amp; may the Blessings of heaven  rest upon you in the name of    &amp; continues to issue her writs against me &amp; this peopl unlawfully &amp; unjustly as they have done &amp; our  rights are trampled upon &amp; they  away my  Heaven I will spill my blood in its defence they  shall not take away our rights &amp; if they dont  stop leading me by the nose I will lead them by  the nose &amp; if they dont let me alone I will turn  up the world I will make war, when we shake  our own bushes we want to ketch our own fruit The Lawyiers themselves acknowledge that we  have all power granted us in our Charters that we  could ask for, that we had more power than  any other court in the state for all other Courts were restricted ENDENTRY July 1, 1843    8 oclock AM President Joseph Smith made  some remarks to the lawyiers his Council, as he was  a prisioner before the Court. President Joseph Smith  then called upon Brigham Young  Sidney Rigdon who  were duly sworn &amp; gave in their testimony, which  occupied most of the day they went through the  whole scene of the persecution from Jackson  County to the time of their expulsion from the  State by force of Armes &amp; it was certainly  the most heart rending seene or rehearsal of it that  ever saluted the ears of any tribunal in a cifilized  government it would have disgraced an arab or  Hotentot, not ownly theft, Arson, Burgalry, prisons  chains, expulsion rape &amp; Murder were practiced  upon the saints without any redress but even  President Joseph Smith with his companions in  prision loaded with chains were  for   given to them to eat &amp; while hearing this part of the  testimony my blood boiled within &amp; the spirit of war   ENDENTRY  Lawyiers were shocked to the soul each one made  a speach at the close of the testimony &amp; they exhort'd  us to stand for our rights stand or fall sink or  swim live or die the whole testimony will  be published to the world in pamphlet form &amp;  probably other wise &amp; will stand as a history to  future generations of the unparelled persecution  of the State of Missouri against the Saints of  the last days    ENDENTRY July 2, 1843     A large congregation assembled &amp; was addressed  in an interesting manner by Elder O Hyde  from the 3  2, 3 &amp; 4 verses &amp; said much to the edifycation  of the people. After elder Hyde closed, Mr Walker  &amp; three other Lawyers spoke in rotation &amp; upheld  President Joseph Smith in his procedings &amp; spoke  of the unlawful conduct of his enemies    ENDENTRY July 3, 1843    &amp; one or two appointed to go to each County in the  State of Illinois. An address was deliverd to the  Elders By President Rigdon who made some  useful remarks among others he said all that  greatness consisted in, in public speaking with any  man was in delivering a chain of Ideas that the  man had well matured speaking of things that  he knew &amp; not of things that he did not know  for should he speak of things he does not know he would set a trap to be caught in, but when  a person understands the subject thorougholy upon  which he is speaking he knows how to defend it This is all the greatest man on earth can do is to   ENDENTRY  The Elders were also addressed by Elder B Young    ENDENTRY July 4, 1843    FIGURE As the Romans took particular notice of any  singular event as ominous of Good or evil so I  will record a small circumstance that took place  in my house this morning. Soon after I arose  in the morning on this 4 wword while hanging in its usual place unsheathed  of itself &amp; the scabbard droped upon the  floor leaving the bear blade suspended from the  peg upon which it hung  As this is the 4 Nauvoo. At a vary early hour people began to  assemble at the grove &amp; at 11 oclock near 13,000  thousand persons had congregated, who were  addressed in a vary able and appropriat  manner by Elder Orson Hyde lately from  Palestine, and who has recently been appointed  on a mission to St Petersburg constant accession of numbers swelled the  congregation to 15,000 as near as could be estimated  &amp; at 2 oclock they were again addressed by  Elder Parley P. Pratt in a masterly discourse  followed by President Joseph Smith upon  the subject of the late arest &amp; persecution  who clearly vindicated his innocence &amp;  showed the corruption of his pursueers in  a tru light. Three steamers arived in the  afternoon—one from St Louis one from  Burlington—bringing altogether   ENDENTRY  to our City. On the arival of each boat they  were escorted to the stand by the Nauvoo  band and the escort companies whare convenient  seats were provided &amp; whare they were  welcomed by the firing of cannon which brought  to our minds the last words of the patriot  Jefferson:- -Let this day be celebrated by the  firing of cannon &amp;c. The legion was not  out.   synopsis of the Address of President Joseph Smith  while speaking in his own defence before about  15,000 souls   I will address them, with few words in my own  defence as touching my arest. In the first  place I will state to these that can hear me  that I never spent more than six months  in Missouri except while in prison, while I  was there I was at work for the support of  my family. I never was a prisioner of war  during my stay for I had not made war, I  never took a pistol a gun, or sword &amp; the much  that has been said on this subject is false I  have been willing to go before any governor  Judge or tribunal whare justice could be done  &amp; have the subject investigated. I could not  have committee treason in that state while  there I had no controll any whare in temporal  things while there but in spiritual I was  driven from that state by force of  arms under the exterminating order of  Govornor Boggs. I have never commited  treason the people know vary well I   ENDENTRY  their has been a great hugh &amp; cry about   crime can be done but what it is laid to  Jo Smith. Here I was again dragged to  the United States court, &amp; was cleared  &amp; now it comes again. But as often as  God sees fit for me to suffer I am ready  But I am as innocent of these crimes as the  Angels in heaven.  I am not an enemy to manki- nd I am a friend to Mankind. I ^am^ not an enemy  to Missouri nor any any governors or people  As to the military station I hold &amp; the cause  of my holding it is as follows. When we came  here the State required us to bear arms &amp; do  military duty according to law, &amp; as the Church  had just been driven from the State of Missou- ri &amp; robed of all their property &amp; arms they were  poor &amp; destitute of armes: they were liable  to be fined for not doing duty when they had not  arms to do it with, they came to me for advice  I advised them to organize themselves into inde- pendant companies, &amp; demand arms of the  State, this they did. Again their were many  Elders having licence to preach which by law  exhonorated them from Military duty but the  officiers would not release them on this ground  I then told the saints that though I was clear  from Military duty by law in consequence  of lameness in one of my legs, yet I would  set them the example &amp; would do duty my- self, they then said they were willing to do duty  if they could be formed into an independant  company &amp; I could be at their head &amp; upon  this ground came the Nauvoo Legion &amp; I   ENDENTRY  not that I seek for power. &amp; with regard  to elections some say we all vote together &amp;  we vote as I say: But I never tell any man how to vote  or who to vote for. But I will show you how  we have been situated by bringing a comparison  Should their be a Methodist society here &amp;  two candidates running for office: one says  if you will vote for me &amp; put me in governor  I will exterminate the Methodist take away their  Charters &amp;c. The other Candidate says if I am  Govornor I will give all an equal privilege, which  would the Methodist vote for, of course they would  vote in mass for the candidate that would give  them their rights; thus it has been with us  Joseps Duncon said if the people would elect  him he would exterminate the mormons &amp; take  away their Charters. As to Mr Ford he made no  such threats, but manifested a spirit in his spea- ches to give every man their rights; hence the  Church universally voted for mr Ford &amp;  he was elected govornor; But he has  issued writs against me the first time the  Missourians made a demand for me &amp; this is  the second one he has issued for me which has  caused me much trouble &amp; expense.

Hyde and myself accompanied Sister Voice to take tea with a sister who was attending to a house near the state house fronting the common we walked all over the house &amp; took a view of the furniture it could not have cost much less than one hundred thousand dollars to have furnished  it. After tea we walked to meeting in a hall in Washington St opposite Boydston hall Elder Hyde had advertised to Preach upon the murder of Hyram Smith and take up a collection at the close to pay his expenses home.    The speaker read the 24  as the foundation of some remarks. Said he would much rather leave the strife of men, and spend his time in speaking of the gospel of Jesus Christ But it is my design to night to speak upon the death of the Prophet &amp; Patriarch. Some might think because of the death of the men it would put a stop to the  work but not so, when  time they were opposed by the world, for any gener- ation, that has a prophet of God in their midst they see his weakness as touching human nature &amp; the people are watching for iniquity &amp; they spend all their time talking about any thing they see him do that does not accord with their traditions &amp; tell a great many falshoods about him but entirely forget and overlook all the good he does. It was   ENDENTRY  impostor and Beelzebub the Prince of devils, and when he was crucifyed they were not satisfyed with his dying merely but went and thrust a spear into his side and their came out Blood and water. But how is it now with the Savior, all profess to believe on him they dont talk about what his persecutors said were his bad deeds but his good ones. whan a man dies his bad deeds die with him and his virtues live and grow brighter. The gentiles say if I had lived in the days of the Savior I would not have killed him but would have rejoiced. But imagin yourselfs living in the days of  look upon him, as the worst of men the same as they did. A man told me he dreamed that some man spoke to him and said Lama, Lama, and he looked and it was Joseph Smith retreating from him and saying those words, the interpetation of which is my God my God &amp; when Joseph Smith was shot he repeated those words. So with the Savior when he was crucified he said Lama, Lama, Sabaethana. As the Jews were not satisfied with killing Jesus Christ, but must thrust a spear into his side so with the gentiles they were not satisfied with shooting the Prophet but stabed him with a dagger in the breast, as soon as they killed them they all fled and in an hour their was not a man left in the place, but the wicked flea when no man persues, but why did the people murder this Prophet what were they afraid of. O if he lives he will take away our power of goverment get the rule in his own hands and we will be distroyed, but they were mistaken. If they had let him alone or had recie- ved him he would have saved the nation from ruin and destruction.

So the devil thinking to  thwart the decree of God by going up &amp; down  in the earth seeking whome he may destroy  any person that he can find that will yield to  him he will bind ^him^ &amp; take possession of the  body &amp; reign there glorying in it mightily not  thinking that he had got a stolen tabernacle &amp; by &amp; by some one of Authority will come  along &amp; cast him out &amp; restore the tabernacle  to his rightful owner but the bevil steals  a tabernacle because he has not one of his own  but if he steals one he is liable to be turned out  of doors    &amp; keys to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding  the Apostle exhorts them to  add to their faith virtue, knowledge temperance  &amp;c yet he exhorts them to make their calling  &amp; election s audible voice from heaven bearing testimony  that Jesus was the son of God yet he says  we have a more sure word of Prophecy whare  unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a  light shining in a dark place. Now wharein  could they have a more sure word of prophecy   ENDENTRY  Great God how such a thing looks that the saints should be afraid of beating one another in the election or being beat I would ask who built up this city would steem boats landed here if the saints had not come, or could you even the speculators have soled their lands for any thing here if the saints had not come they might have sold for a few bare &amp; wolf skins but not for money, can these speculaters sell all their land to the saints for a great price &amp; then go away &amp; enjoy it somewhare els I tell you nay, for know it ye people that Israel is here &amp; they are the head and not the tail &amp; the people must learn it all those who have gone from us have gone from the head to the tail. But if any of you wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up butter it both sides &amp; then it will fall butter side up. Uppose this work &amp; it will roll over you, when did this work ever stop since it began never. The ownly thing the saints now want to know is what does the Lord want of us &amp; we are ready to do it. Well then build the temple of the Lord keep the law of God ye saints &amp; the hypocritt &amp; Scroundral will flee out of your midst &amp; tremble for the fire of God will be two hot for them, he made many important remarks.    with an address upon political matters he traced the history of governments for many centuries &amp; traced the form of governments from ancient days to the present time He spoke of our Charters &amp; General Smith being a candidate for the Presidential chair &amp; we must do what we can to elect   ENDENTRY  hide his head under cover &amp; leaves his body out in sight to be seen as we pass along so cowards here after will be called an Ostrich. He also made some remarks concerning the building of the Temple. Elder Young remarked that he should visit those who did not pay up their tithing you will want a blessing in the temple when it is done    those who give in property for the temple we want it brought to the proper source that it may be put on the Church Book So that in  the endowment those whose names are on book shall have the prefference. As to politics I care but little about the Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much for the office as I would for the one I now hold, but as the world have used the power of Goverment to oppress &amp; persecute us it is right for us to use it for the protection of our rights. when I get hold of the eastern paper &amp; see how popular I am I am afraid myself that I shall be elected, But if I should be I would not say that your cause is just &amp; I could not do any thing for you. what I said in relation to the annexation of texas is with some unpopular the people are opposed to it. I will take this objection away. the opposition is because it is filled up with slavery, now I wish to turn the argument it is the vary reason why it ought to be received in order to watch over them of the  we should reject the greatest. The president of Texas sayes if you do not receive us in the United States we will go to the British this would certainly be bad policy for this Nation the British are now through out that whole country trying to bribe all they can. How much better it is to be to a little expens   ENDENTRY  us all. we should grasp all the territory we can and I know, much that I do not tell I have had bribes offered me, but I have rejected them. The government will not receive any thing from me they are self sufficient, but they must go to Hell &amp; work out their own salvation with fear &amp; trembling as soon as texas was annexed I would liberate two or three states &amp; pay them for their slaves &amp; let them go to blacks &amp;c I would also receive Canida &amp; stand by them &amp; many other usful remarks He made A collection was taken up to buy powder &amp; fuse rope about $60 dollars was recieved. meeting closed &amp; we returned to our homes    ENDENTRY March 8, 1844    my house I met in council in the evening with the presidency &amp; twelve. spoke concerning a candidate for the vice Presidency they had nominated Gen Arlington Bennet not knowing that he was a native of Ireland. the final decision was for me to write to Col Solomon Copeland to invite him to visit us &amp; see if he would suffer his name to run for the vice Presidency    ENDENTRY March 9, 1844    some garding I planted &amp; sowed onions potatoes set out raspburies this is the earliest time I ever undertook to make a garding   ENDENTRY March 10, 1844    to Sister Sarah B. Foss &amp; wrote one letter to Col King Follet was buried this day under Masonic honors he was killed while in a well by having a bucket of stone fall onto him    &amp; was addressed by President Joseph Smith upon one of the most important &amp; interesting subjects ever presented to the saints &amp; the principles presented were of the greatest importance to be understood it was as follows the work &amp; calling &amp; spirit Mesiah. The following is a synopsis of the discourse    of Elias &amp; Elijah it is the spirit of Elias I wish first to speak of. And in order to come at the subject I will bring some of the testimony from the scripture &amp; give my own, in the first place suffice it to say I went into the woods to inq wire of the Lord by prayer his will concern- ing me, &amp; I saw an angel &amp; he laid his hands upon my head &amp; ordained me to be a priest after the order of keys of this priesthood which office was to preach repentance &amp; Baptism for the remission of Sins &amp; also to baptise but was informed that this office did not extend to the laying on of hands for the giving of the Holy Ghost that that office was a greater work &amp; was to be given afterwards but that my ordination was a preparetory work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way for the greater, which was the case with John the Baptist he came balling through the wilderness prepare ye the   ##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-70## ENDENTRY  &amp; they were informed if they could receive it it was the spirit of Elias &amp; John was vary particular to tell the people he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light. ##John 1:6-9## He told the people that his mission was to preach repentane &amp; baptize with water, but it was he that should come after him that should baptise with fire &amp; the Holy Ghost ##Matthew 3:11## if he had been an imposture he might have gone to work beyound, his bounds &amp; undertook to have performed ordinances that did not belong to that office &amp; calling under the spirit of Elias. The spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater revelation of God which is the priesthood of Elias or the Priesthood of Aaron was ordained unto. And when God sends a man into the world to prepare for a greater work holds the keys of the power of Elias it was called the doctrin of Elias even from the early ages of the world. John's mission was limited to preaching &amp; baptizing but what he done was legal &amp; when Jesus Christ came to any of John's deciples he baptized them with fire &amp; the Holy Ghost. We find the Apostles endowed with greater power than John their office was more under the spirit &amp; power of  Elijah than Elias. In the case of Philip when he went down to Samaria was under the spirit of Elias he baptized both men &amp; women, when Peter &amp; John herd of it they went down &amp; lade hands on them &amp; they received the Holy Ghost this shows the distinction between the two powers. ##Acts 8:12-17## when Paul came to certain deciples he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost they said no, who baptized you then we were baptized unto Johns Baptism   ##Acts 19:1-6## ENDENTRY  his work right, &amp; so Paul went &amp; baptized them  for he knew what the true doctrin was &amp; he  knew that John had not Baptised them, &amp; these  principles and is strange to me that men who have  red the scriptures of the New Testament are so  far from it. What I want to impress upon your  minds is the difference of power in the different  parts of the Priesthood, so that when any man  comes among you saying I have the spirit of Elias  you can know whether he be true or fals, for  any man that comes having the spirit &amp; power of  Elias he will not transend his bounds. John  did not transend his bound but faithfully performed  that part belonging to his office, and evry portion  of the great building should be prepared right &amp;  assigned to its proper place, &amp; it is necessary  to know who holds the keys of power &amp; who  dont, or we may be likely to be decieved. That  person who holds the keys of Elias hath a prep- aritory work, But if I spend much more  time in conversing about the spirit of Elias I  shall not have time to do justice to the spirit &amp;  power of Elijah, this is the Elias spoken of in the last days &amp; here is the rock upon which many  split thinking the time was past in the days of  John &amp; Christ &amp; no more to be, but the spirit of  Elias was revealed to me &amp; I know it is true therefore  I speak with boldness for I know varily my doctrin  is true. Now for Elijah, the spirit power &amp;  calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the keys  of the revelations ordinances, oricles powers &amp; endow- ments of the fulness of the Melchezedek Priesthood  &amp; of the kingdom of God on the Earth &amp; to recieve,  obtain &amp; perform all the ordinances belonging to the  kingdom of God even unto the sealing of the hearts   ENDENTRY  of the children unto the fathers even those who are  in heaven. Malachi says I will send Elijah befor  the great and dredful day of the Lord come &amp; He  shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children  and the hearts of the Children to the Fathers lest I  come &amp; smite the earth with a curse. Now what I  am after is the knowledge of God &amp; I take my own  course to obtain it, what are we to under^stand^ by this  in the last days, in the days of Noah God destroyed  the world by a flood &amp; has promised to destroy  it by fire in the last days but before it took place  Elijah should first come &amp; turn the hearts of  the Fathers to the children &amp;c. now comes the  point what is this office &amp; work of Elijah, it is  one of the greatest &amp; most important subjects that  God has revealed, he should send Elijah to seal the  children to the fathers &amp; fathers to the children, now  was this merely confined to the living to settle diffic- ulties with families on earth, by no means, it was a  far greater work Elijah what would you do if you  was here? would you  living alone. No. I would  scriptures whare the subject is manifest, ie without  us they could not be made perfect nor we  without them, the fathers without the children  nor the children without the fathers. I wish  you to understand this subject for it is important  &amp; if you will recieve it this is the spirit of Elijah  that we redeem our dead &amp; connect ourselves  with our fathers which are in heaven &amp; seal  up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection  &amp; here we want the power of   in    ENDENTRY  a case. suppose the great God who dwells in heaven  should reveal himself to Father Cutler here  by the opening heavens and tell him I offer  up a decree that whatsoever you seal on earth  with your decree I will seal it in heaven, you have  power then, can it be taken of? No. Then what  you seal on earth by the keys of Elijah is sealed in  heaven &amp; this is the power of Elijah, &amp; this is  the difference between the spirit &amp; power of Elias  and Elijah for while the spirit of Elias is a fore  runner the power of Elijah is sufficient to make  our Calling &amp; Election sure &amp; the same doctrin  whare we are exhorted to go on  laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands, resurrection  of the dead &amp;c we cannot be perfect without the  fathers, &amp;c we must have revelations then  &amp; we can see that the doctrin of revelation  as far transcends the doctrin of no revelation as  knowlede is above ignorance for one truth revealed  from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in  exhistance. This spirit of Elijah was manifest in  the days of the apostles in delivering certain ones  to the buffitings of Satan that they may be saved in  the day of the Lord Jesus, they were sealed by the  spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of Hell untill the  day of the Lord or revelation of Jesus Christ Here is the doctrin of Election that the world  have quarreled so much about but they do  not know any thing about it. The doctrin  that the Prysbeterians &amp; Methodist have  quarreled so much about once in grace always in  grace, or falling away from grace I will say a word  about, they are both wrong, truth takes a road  between them both. for while the Presbyterian  says once in grace you cannot fall the   ENDENTRY  from it to morrow, next day have grace again &amp; so  follow it, but the doctrin of the scriptures &amp; the  spirit of Elijah would show them both fals &amp;  take a road between them both for according to the  scriptures if a man has receive the good word of  God &amp; tasted of the powers of the world to come if  they shall fall away it is impossible to renew them  again, seeing they have crucified the son of God  afresh &amp; put him to an open  is a possibility of falling away you could not be  renewed again, &amp; the power of Elijah cannot  seal against this sin for this is a reserve made  in the seals &amp; power of the priesthood, I will make  evry doctrin plain that I present &amp; it shall stand  upon a firm bases And I am at the defiance of  the world for I will take shelter under the  broad  I am ingaged, it matters not to me if all hell boils  over I regard it ownly as I would the crackling  of thorns under a pot. A murderer, for instance  one that sheds innocent blood cannot have  forgiveness. David sought repentance at the hand  of God carefully with tears but he could ownly  get it through Hell. he got a promise that his  soul should not be left in Hell. Although David  was a king he never did obtain the spirit &amp; power  of Elijah &amp; the fulness of the Priesthood, &amp; the  priesthood that he received &amp; the throne &amp; kingdom  of David is to be taken from him &amp; given to another  by the name of David in the last days raised up  out of his linage. Peter refered to the same  subject on the day of pentecost, but the multi- tude did not get the endowment that Peter had  but several days after the people asked what shall   ENDENTRY  speaking of crucifying the Lord &amp;c He did not say  to them repent &amp; be baptized for the remission  of your sins but he said repent therefore &amp; be  converted that your sins may be blotted out when the  times of refreshing shall come from the presence  of the Lord.  they could not be baptized for the remission  of sins for they had shed innocent Blood.     as follows if you have power to seal on earth &amp; in  heaven then we should be crafty, the first  thing you do go &amp; seal on earth your sons &amp; daughters  unto yourself &amp; yourself unto your fathers in  eternal glory, &amp; go ahead and not go back, but  use a little craftiness &amp; seal all you can &amp; when  you get to heaven tell your father that what  you seal on earth should be sealed in heaven I will walk through the gate of heaven and claim  what I seal &amp; those that follow me &amp; my council The Lord once told me that what I asked for  I should have. I have been afraid to  ask God to kill my enemies lest some of them  should peradventure  short time since for the Lord to deliver me  out of the hands of the govornor of Missouri &amp; if it must needs be to accomplish it to take  him away &amp; the next news that came pouring  down from their was Govornor   how you fight against the saints of God &amp; shed innocent  blood, for in the days of Elijah his enemies came  upon him &amp; fire was called down from heaven  &amp; destroyed them, the spirit of Elias is first,  Elijah second, &amp; Mesiah last. Elias is a fore runner  to prepare the way, &amp; the spirit &amp; power of Elijah   ENDENTRY  the Temple to the cap stone, placing the seals of  the Melchezedeck priesthood up on the house of Israel  &amp; making all things ready then  his Temple which is last of all. Mesiah is above  the spirit &amp; power of Elijah for he made the world  &amp; was that spiritual rock unto Moses in the  wilderness. Elijah was to come &amp; prepare the way  &amp; build up the kingdom before the coming of  the great day of the Lord. Although the spirit of  Elias might begin it, I have asked of the  Lord concerning his Coming &amp; while asking, the  Lord gave me a sign &amp; said in the days of Noah  I set a bow in the heavens as a sign &amp; token that  in any year that the bow should be seen the Lord  would not come, but their should be seed time &amp; harvest during that year, but whenever you  see the bow withdraw it shall be a token that their  shall be famin pestilence &amp; great distress among  the nations. But I take the responsibility upon  myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord, that  Christ will not come this year as Miller has  prophecyed, for we have seen the bow. And  I also Prophecy in the name of the Lord that  Christ will not Come in  if God ever spake by my mouth he will not  come in that length of time, &amp; Jesus Christ  never did reveal to any man the precise time that  he would come, go &amp; read the scriptures &amp; you  cannot find any thing that specifies the exact time he  would come &amp; all that say so are fals teachers.  Their are some important things concerning the  office of the Mesiah in the organization of the  world which I will speak of hereafter.
