 Nov 14 [189]0    Spencer Clawson Esqr  Dear Brother.    In reply to yours of Oct 30th respecting  the date of the first erection of the "Eagle Gate"  will say that, I have examined my  Journal and find that if I knew of the   circumstance at the time, I did not make  any note of it in my journal, so that I  cannot give you any better information  than that furnished by Elder John Jacques.    Very respectfully    Your Brother  W Woodruff 
 of course upon this they want no compromise. I am  still in favor of settleing this matter without going to law  if it can be done.    Your Brother  W Woodruff 
 trust that we may meet there as friends, where we can enjoy each other's society,  and where righteous law, justice and equity will reign triumphant.    Again expressing the gratitude and respect of myself and in behalf of  my people for your untiring labors,    I remain, very respectfully,    Your Friend,  Wilford Woodruff 
 September 16 [188]7    Mrs Zina D. H Young,  Dear Sister:    Your letter of sepr 15th has been  received and perused with much interest and  pleasure.    I am glad to know that you are able, walso  willing to cdevote your time and talents in the interest  of God's work here upon the earth—in visiting  with and raising your voice in counsel among   your Sisters in the various settlements in Zion.    In regard to your making a visit to the  Saints who are located over the line in the Domin-  ion of Canada, I would say, if you feel like going  we certainly feel to approbate your doing so. 
 Your presence will be a comfort to Sister Zina, and  give her as also yourself much joy, and will be a  pleasant visitation to the Saints who have settled  in that land, under their present peculiar  circumstances.    We feel to ask the blessings of the Lord to  attend you in your journeyings; that you may be  preserved from all harm and evil of every kind,  and that you may be enabled to minister to the  wants of these whom you shall meet at your journeys  end, and When you conclude to return that you  may travel in peace and safety to your home having  accomplished a good work to your own satisfaction  and the honor of God.    With kindest remembrances to yourself, to  Sister Zina and all the Saints.    I remain,  Your Brother in the Gospel.  Wilford Woodruff

SALT LAKE CITY, -  August, 1880.    THE PIONEERS.  NOTHING in the grand celebration on   the Twenty-fourth was more interesting  than the remnant of the heroic company  of Pioneers, which appeared in the pro-  cession. There were not many of them,  but those who did attend, presented the  appearance of true heroes, and coura-  geous leaders, who braved the dangers  of the desert to make homes in a barren  wilderness for their friends and their  posterity, and to unfurl the banner of  religious liberty upon the mountains as  an ensign to the nations. Too much can-  not be said in praise of the Pioneers.  They should be held in honored remem-  brance by their children and by the resi-  dents of our Territory. Their names  should be committed to memory by the  youth of Zion, and made as imperishable  in our hearts as the glorious deeds they  have done are imperishable.    Elder Wilford Woodruff's speech de-  livered in the Tabernacle included  the following brief sketch of their  entrance into Great Salt Lake Valley,  and tribute of respect to those who have  died, and words of encouragement to the   surviving members of the honored band.    THE ADDRESS.  We now come to the Pioneers, in honor  of whom we have got up this great cele-  bration to-day. In consequence of sick-  ness, President Young and the main  body of the pioneer camp rested east of  the Wasatch Mountains, and on the 13th  of July, 1847, Orson Pratt was appointed  to take some twenty-three wagons and  forty-two men, and go in advance to  make a road over the mountains. They  cut a road through thick groves of quak-  ing aspen and bear swales. Orson Pratt  and Erastus Snow entered this valley  ahead of their own company on the 21st  of July. They had a fine view of the  valley and returned to camp in the even-  ing, one and a half miles up Emigration  Cañon.    On the 22d, Orson Pratt, George A.  Smith and seven others rode into the  valley, leaving their camp to follow and  work the road. President Young being  sick, I was carrying him on a bed made  up in my carriage, and we camped with   the main body of the company on East  Cañon Creek.    On the 23d, the remainder of Orson  Pratt's advance company entered the  valley, founded an encampment, and  commenced to plow the ground. I crossed  the mountains that day with President  Young and his part of the company, and  camped about six miles from the mouth  of Emigration Cañon. We found an ex-  ceedingly rough road in passing through  the stumps of the trees that the advance  company had cut.    On the 24th I drove my carriage, with  President Young lying on a bed in it,  into the open valley, the rest of the com-  pany following. When we came out of  the cañon into full view of the valley, I  turned the side of my carriage around,  open to the west, and President Young  arose from his bed and took a survey of   the country. While gazing upon the  scene before us, he was enwrapped in   vision for several minutes. He had seen  the valley before in vision, and upon this  occasion he saw the future glory of Zion  and of Israel, as they would be, planted  in the valleys of these mountains. When  the vision had passed, he said: "It is  enough. This is the right place. Drive  on." So I drove to the encampment  already formed by those who had come  along in advance of us. 
 At a mass meeting held in the schoolhouse    Springville May 20th [18]55 at 2 oclock P.M. It was unanimously  resolved:    That, in view of the organisation of a branch of the   Universal Scientific Society in this city; the following   persons be appointed ^as a committee^ to form a constitution, and draw up  such rules and regulations as may be neccessary for the govern-  ment of said branch: said committee to report progress to a   a mass meeting whenever they are prepared to do so.

Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother;    At a recent  Council of the Apostles it was decided that three  missionaries should be maintained among the  Navajoes and one missionary to the Zuni Village.  These brethren—E. A. Teitjen, J. Ashcroft, John Harris  and [blank] James—we are informed, are in  narrow circumstances; but, it is said, they are well  posted in the language of these tribes and have  proved themselves to be diligent and faithful mission-  aries and greatly desiring the redemption of the La-  manites from their low condition. It is said that  their great drawback is a want of means, which, if 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, June 15, 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    Your favor of the 6th. inst., written at Moab, has  just been received and perused with interest, which is always felt in hearing from  you concerning yourself and your labors. You must have had a fatiguing trip. If  the weather where you have been has been anything like what we have had in this City  since you left and almost up to the date of your letter, you have had pleasant, cool  weather for your journey. Within a few days the summer has burst upon us and we are   now having as hot weather as is usual at this time of the year.    We have been busy since your departure attending to  matters which have arisen connected with the Church ssuit. There is a feeling at  the present time in the Council to endeavor, if we can, to effect some sort of a set-  tlement, to stop the proceedings before the Examiner. The manner in which the breth-  ren have failed under the examination of the U.S. District attorney has caused us all  to feel that if we can by any means stop future proceedings in this direction without  too great a sacrifice, we shall willingly do so. Whether we will be successful or  not remains to be seen; but negotiations are now in progress looking to this end.    Brothers Joseph F. Smith, F. S. Richards and C. W. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 19, 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother: Our attention has been repeatedly   called to the apathy and indifference of our people in regard to their political  rights; while, on the other hand, our enemies were never so well organezed, so thorough  and united, nor more determined in their opposition than now.    The experiences that we have had in the "irrepressible conflict" between the  Church and Kingdom of God and the world, from the days of Ohio, Missouri and Illinois  down to the recent experiences of our disfranchised people in Idaho, proves beyond  doubt that the "price of liberty", to us, "is eternal vigilance", and implicit reliance   upon the protection and mercy of Almighty God.    The malignant animus and the wicked purposes of our relentless foes were not   more apparent in the mobbings and drivings from Missouri, or the martyrdom of our  Prophets and the expulsion of the Saints from Illinois than they were in the infa-  mous propositions embodied in the Edmunds and the Edmunds-Tucker laws, the appoint-  ment of the Utah Commission and other Territorial and local officers to rule over us,  the confiscation of our property, and many other things open to the view of all the  people, which are in themselves mild and humane in comparison to measures which have  been proposed to Congress for the destruction of our rights and liberty, as Latter-  day Saints, and the subjugation of the Church of God, which have not as yet crystaliz-  ed into penal statutes against us. Among them the proposition to compel wives to  testify against their husbands, and to make the status of polygamy, as well as the act  a crime punishable with excessive penalities, to disfranchise all Mormons and the utter

Dear Brother:    I have just received your favor of the   14th inst. I am glad to hear from you, and that you  have survived the exposures to which you have been sub-  jected. If the weather where you have been has been  equally severe with that which we have had in this   locality, you must have encountered serious risk in being  out traveling. We have had colder weather probably  than ever before since we came to these mountains.  For a few days, however, it has moderated very much  and it has been thawing. There are very few houses  in the city which have water pipes leading into them 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. Jany. 28th 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    We write you at  a venture, not knowing whether this will reach you or  not.    At a recent meeting of the Council the subject  of an appropriation to aid the missionaries among the  Navajoes came up and was considered. The Council  decided to appropriate $1000.00, to be apportioned by  you between Brother E. A. Tietjin and one other suit-  able Elder whom you would designate as his compan-  ion. It was felt that you were in a position to  know who the other person would be and what pro-  portion of the $1000.00 each should have, and this is 
 EDITORIAL. 253    When we arrived on the ground, the  brethren had commenced ploughing. I  had brought a bushel of potatoes with  me, and I resolved that I would neither  eat nor drink until I had planted them. I  got them into the ground by one o'clock,  and these, with the potatoes that the  other brethren had planted, became the  foundation for the future potato crops of  Utah.    In the evening, in company with Heber  C. Kimball, George A. Smith and E. T.  Benson, I rode up City Creek Cañon to   look for timber. While there we had a  thunder shower, and the rain reached  nearly over the whole valley.    The following day, the 25th, was the  first Sabbath that the Saints of God ever  spent in these valleys of the mountains,  and George A. Smith preached the first   sermon ever delivered here, followed by  Heber C. Kimball and Ezra T. Benson  in the forenoon, and W. Woodruff, O.  Pratt and W. Richards in the afternoon.  President Young, though feeble, closed  by giving good advice to the Saints. He  desired them not to work, fish, hunt or  play on Sunday, but go to meeting and  worship God. They must keep the com-  mandments of God, or not dwell with us,  and no man should by or sell land, but  all should have what they could cultivate  free, and no man should possess that  which was not his own.    On Monday, the 26th, President Young  and the Twelve went up Ensign Peak,  and he said there was a proper place to  raise an ensign to the nations. So we  named it Ensign Peak. I was the first  person that stood on the top of it. We  also visited the Hot and Warm Springs.    On the 27th, President Young with  fourteen others, eight of them being of  the Twelve, crossed the Jordan and went  west to Black Rock, which we walked to  dry shod, where to-day our trail is cov-  ered with some ten feet of water. Pres-  ident Young was the first of the Pioneers   that touched the salt water. We re-  turned to the point of the mountain and  camped for the night.    On the morning of the 28th we returned  to our encampment on the site of this  city, accompanied by some of the native  Utes, the first we had seen. After we  had arrived at our encampment, Presi-  dent Young had a council with the  Twelve, and took a walk about our en-  campment. He then stopped, stuck his  cane down, and said: "Here will be the  Temple of our God." This was about  the centre of the site of the Temple we  are building upon this block. It was  then decided by vote that we lay out the  city of Great Salt Lake, with its blocks,  lots and streets, much as it stands this  day. Upon this interesting occasion,  President Young delivered a very inter-  esting address, which I recorded in my   journal.    We spent thirty-three days in the Val-  ley of the Great Salt Lake, laid out a  city, and built a fort covering ten acres,  the east side enclosed with log houses,  and the other three sides with adobie  walls.    On the 26th of August, we bid fare-  well to the few left in the valley, a por-  tion of whom belonged to the Mormon  Battalion, and, being sick, were left be-  hind by the Battalion.    When we arrived in this valley we  found it a barren desert, and a very des-  ert it was. There was no mark of the  white man. We found a few naked In-  dians, who would eat a pint of roasted  crickets for their dinner. But a great  change has come over this desert. A  generation has passed. Eight of the  quorum of the Twelve Apostles who  were then living, and most of them  among the Pioneers, are now in the spirit  world. Orson Pratt, Erastus Snow and  myself are the only ones living who were  among the Pioneers and in the Quorum  of the Twelve at that time. Truly then   we found a barren desert. To-day I  stand in a tabernacle filled with some ten  thousand of the Latter-day Saints who  have followed the Pioneers into these   valleys of the mountains. When we  cast our eyes over these valleys, then a

Woodruff President of the   Universal Scientific Society.    Res. 8:   That the Secretary of the committee is hereby authorised, and   required to further a copy of the above minutes to President   W. Woodruff, and request instruction from him as to future  proceedings, also to state our wish to be recognised by  the Universal S. Society, as a branch of the same 
 they were furnished with, would enable them to accom-  plish a great work among these peoples.    The Council of the Apostles, taking into  consideration these circumstances, have appropriated  $70000 from the tithing of St. Johns, Snowflake and  San Juan Stakes. This amount is to be added to  the $100000 already appropriated to that mission,  and of which you have received notice. It is expect-  ed that this $70000, added to the previous $100000, will  supply the necessary funds to carry on the labor  in this mission for about one year. These funds  will be expended under your direction, and by  applying to Bro. James Jack, who has been notified  of the appropriation, you will be able to draw it  as you may need.    The committee to whom our Indian  affairs were referred have recommended that a mis-  sion be established among the Utes and have for  its base Mancos and Bluff City. This recommend-  ation was adopted by the Council; and as you have 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    P.O. BOX B Salt Lake City U.T. January 4th 1888,    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    Your favor of  24th Dec. has reached me.    I think it of the utmost importance that  everything should be done that is possible to prevent any  political division among our own people in the Stakes  of Snowflake and St. John's. If you have it in your  power, and you have not already done so, we hope  you will impress this, with all the power you have,  upon the minds of the leading men. Our people  should sink all petty jealousies and local rivalries and  every feeling that will interfere in the least with har-  monious action on their part as voters. Any division  among us will greatly lessen our influence. If we

We, as pio-  neers and as the people of God, are ful-  filling prophecy and making history.  This tabernacle in which we are to-day,  is the very tabernacle that Isaiah saw in  vision twenty-six hundred years ago,  that should be as a shadow in the day-  time from the heat, and a covert from the  storm and from the rain. We are also  building the temple of our God, on this  block, which the prophet saw was to be  built in the last days upon the mountains  of the Lord's house, and be established  on the tops of the mountains, for all  people to flow unto. Isaiah ii, 2, 3. "And  many people shall go and say, Come ye,  and let us go up to the mountain of the  Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob;  and he will teach us of his ways, and we  will walk in his paths; for out of Zion  shall go forth the law, and the word of  the Lord from Jerusalem." Our whole  life, history, and travels have been point-  ed out by the ancient prophets. As the   pioneers came into this barren desert  and the Saints have followed them to  fulfill the prophecies to make the desert  blossom as the rose, to sow our grain be-  side all small streams and still waters,  and to use the fir, the pine, and the box,  to beautify the place of God's sanctuary  and to make the place of his feet glorious,  and as there is but a remnant of us left as  Pioneers, or Battalion, or Zion's Camp,  let us magnify our calling and build up  the Zion and Kingdom of God until it is  perfected before the heavens and the  earth, and not disappoint those who sent  us, nor those who have seen us by vision  and revelation, but let us finish and fulfill  our destiny to the satisfaction of our  heavenly Father, his angels, and all  good men.

There is nothing particularly new to write  about, and there is no special labor that I have to  assign you where you are. Everything is moving along  very quietly at present. A report, however, has reached  us that the Marshal intends to change the arrange-  ment which he has with his deputies, and instead of  giving them a salary, to give them a commission on  the work they do. If this be true, and they should  operate hereafter upon that principle, we may reasonably  expect more activity on their part in their efforts to dis-  cover those under indictment, or against whom they  may hope to be successful in bringing in convictions.    We are expecting Brother John H. Smith to  arrive every day. Brother Lyman is already here. Brother  L. Snow and M. Thatcher are at their homes. Brother  E. Snow is in the south. The other brethren are  here in the city, with the exception of Brother Teas-  dale, from whom we hear good reports concerning his

Brother Thales  Haskell, who is a very excellent interpreter, and who  has had a great deal of experience among the Ute  Indians, is now located at Bluff City, in San Juan  Stake. It is thought that he might be made  very useful in dealing with the Lamanites and in  teaching them and bringing them into greater har-  mony with us and also with true civilization. It  should be the effort of our people to not only baptize  and confirm the Lamanites, who will receive the  Gospel, into the Church, but, as soon as possible, or-  ganize them into Branches and instruct them in  the principles of true religion, and impart unto them  also the arts of true civilization. They are in a  very degraded, lamentable condition.

 Penrose reached the City last Sunday in good health and spirits. They had an in-  teresting time in Washington and feel well concerning the result of their labors.  Brother Richards has seen every Senator but one, and Brother Penrose has been with   him most of the time; and they have been together in visiting a great number of the   leading Representatives. They have done good missionary work and have given a great   amount of information to all with whom they have conversed concerning the situation   of our affairs, and it is but reasonable to expect that great good has been done.    There is a general softening of feeling towards Utah, they say. Brother John T. Caine   writes also, in a letter which we received yesterday, to the effect that he has   never been treated with greater courtesy than at the present time, and there is no   spirit of hatred manifested by public men. It seems as though the time has come of   which mention has been made when the Lord would soften the hearts of our enemies.   We trust this softening process will continue until we shall regain our liberty and   be free from the annoyances to which we have been subjected so long. There will   doubtless be lulls in the storm, of which we can take advantage.    Brother Lyman came back to the City a few days   ago. He is well.    The Board of Education met a week ago, and a reso-  lution was adopted to request the Presidency of each Stake to select a Board of  Education for the Stake of suitable men who had the educational interests of the 
 demolition of our church organizations.    As an evidence of what would result from falling into the hands of our ene-  mies, of the few rights left us, we need only to look to the treatment of our people  in Idaho where, so far as possible, every vestige of political rights and freedom have  been denied them because of their belief in and connection with the Church.    There has been suggested to us on several occasions by persons who think  they are friends of the people, the subject of political iorganizations in this Terri-  tory, having in view a change from the People's party to those known as the national   parties—Democrats and Republicans. Situated as we are we have deemed such a step to  be very unwise. When advances of this character have been made by some of our peo-  ple in good faith, how have they been treated? The Territorial convention of Demo-  crats, called under the authorization of the National Democratic Committee, that met  at Ogden in May, 1888, at which time and in which convention the efforts of some mem-  bers of the People's party to unite with them on democratic principles, were so shame-  fully treated, and those making the effort were grossly insulted.    It should not be forgotten that those calling themselves Democrats and  Republicans and Liberals have ever and all the time united against the majority of  the people of this Territory; they will ewen obliterate party lines for this purpose,  and always and everywhere speak of our people—the People's party—as political heri-  tics.    Pending the time when all who love liberty aod the rights of their fellow-  men may unite on a platform of equal jusitce, we urge the importance of prompt action  and constant effort to strengthen the rank and dile of the People's party, always a-  voiding the unwise policy of urging for office or position those who have not the  confidence and respect of the people and, possibly, otherwise unqualified for the suf-  frages of the legal voters.

 stand united, though we are not numerically strong, our  influence is felt and respected. Then in whatever direction  we may choose to vote we will carry with us the  proper influence.    Respecting the appropriation for the three  missionaries among the Navajoes, you will doubtless re-  member that the matter was before the Council and  as soon as possible it will receive consideration.    We think you are quite justified in send-  ing the brethren as you propose, to prevent misunder-  standing between the natives and our people at Moen-  coppy. We should do everything in our power to  avoid any irritation arising between the Lamanites and  ourselves, and no pains should be spared to prevent  the secret machinations of bad white men from having  their effect against us upon the Indian mind.    Since my last to you there has nothing  particularly new transpired, though how soon there  may be now that Dyer has returned we cannot say.  We are having winter weather now, and better health,  we think, is prevailing.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.    Salt Lake City, Utah, August 9, 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    I am in receipt of two favors from you, under  date of the 2nd. inst., which have just arrived. The information you give con-  cerning the circumstances of the family of Brother Gilbert Greer will be con-  sidered and acted upon in some form as soon as possible.    The suggestions which you make about someone  attending the Stake Conferences at Snowflake and St. Johns have been taken into  consideration, and I have just written to Brother John Henry Smith, requesting  him, if convenient, to attend those conferences, and have also written to Bishop  R. T. Burton to learn whether he can make it convenient to join Brother Smith in this  visit. Brother Burton has had considerable experience in matters of this char-  acter in the past and will be a wise counselor and pacificator with Brother John  Henry in bringing about harmonious conclusions among the brethren of the two  Stakes. It is very desirable that we should avoid anything like conflict or  division in our political matters, as it would have a tendency to weaken us and  destroy our union. We hope that there will be such action as will lead to the

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, June 8, 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    The enclosed letter, so full of pathos and good  feeling concerning the case referred to, and expressive of the writer's strong desire  for her household to be kept in fellowship with the Church, has been recieved by me from Sister Mary Coray Roberts, the wife of Brother O. C. Roberts. The letter fully  explains the case as far as we know anything about it.    I would like you to take the matter in hand and  have it carefully examined. It would be well perhaps to have Brother John Morgan  join you in the examination of this case. He is here at the present time, but leaves  for Colorado in the morning. We have submitted this matter to him, and he says that  if he is advised by you where he shall meet you, he will hold himself in readiness  to respond to any request you may make to meet him. You should inform him the time  and the place most convenient for you to meet. A letter addressed to Manassa, Colora-  do, will reach him.    We have written by this mail to Brother F. A. Ham-  mond to not enforce the decision, but to await a further examination of the case by  you.    With love and praying the Lord to bless you,    I remain, Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 people at heart, not to exceed eight in number nor be less than five. We expect  to enter into arrangements as quickly as possible for the establishment of an academy  in every Stake.    President Wells write that the Spirit of the Lord  has been visibly manifested in the Manti Temple and been greatly enjoyed by himself  and co-workers and the people who have gone there to receive ordinances.    With kind regards, in which Brothers Geo. Q. and  Jos. F. join, and praying the Lord to bless you and preseve you from every evil and  fill you with His Holy Spirit.

 The apathy and careless indifference of the people at the last election for  Delegate to Congress shows the great necessity for prompt action on the part of the   law-abiding citizens of the Territory.    Without multiplying words I think it necessary that these matters should pe [be]  taken in hand by the Apostles, the Presidents of Stakes, the Bishops and all the El-  ders in Israel, with a view if awakening the Saints and all friends of human rights  to a realizing sense of the dangers which threaten us through the negligence, care-  lessness and indifference of the people to the dangers which threaten them, but which  may be averted or at least postponed by reasonable diligence on their part. For   while we should always rely fully in our faith and confidence, in the mercies of God,  the folly of indifference, neglect of other duties or idleness must be apparent to  every rational mind.    It is therefore desired that the Apostles, so far as possible, will use due  diligence in bringing this subject, in the wisdom and discretion of their high call-  ing, as prominetly as the Spirit in wisdom dictates through them before the Stake  and Ward authorities, ar [and] also the Quorums of the priesthood and the Saints as they vis-  it among the people.    With kind regards,    I am,    Your Brother,  W Woodruff 
 Dec. 15, 1890.    George C. Unglish,  Fairport, Monroe Co, N. Y.    Dear Sir:    Your letter of the 12th inst. is received, and in reply will say, that  Asa Woodruff, of whom you speak, is not my brother. I had one cousin in Avon  by the name of John, who was the son of Ozen Woodruff. I am visited by quite  a number of Woodruffs from Connecticut, and there are several now living in this  city besides my own family. I am the son of Aphek Woodruff of Avon: and was  born the 1st of March, 1807. I had two brothers, Azmon and Thompson. Azmon was  buried in this city a year ago last November, aged 87; Thompson is still living  Daysville, Oswego County, New York. He is about 86 years of age.    Yours respectfully  Wilford Woodruff

Layton, from Colorado, who is a joint  owner of a large Ranch, from whom Bros Silas S.  Smith and F. A. Hammond bought a quantity of  land. I became acquainted with Mr Layton last  year and he became converted to Mormonism  and wanted to be baptized. He came to this city last  Thursday to have another interview with me so that he  might be baptized. He was taken with Paralysis and  died yesterday afternoon at the Continental Hotel before  we met. His friends will take his remains back to  Colorado for burial.    Now I wish you to have him baptized f[or] and

 2    best results.    Brother F. S. Richards has returned from Washing-  ton and brings us the intelligence that the acting Attorney General, in the  case submitted to him, has decided that the Temple Block in this city and the  Council House corner shall be left free from molestation; but that the Tithing  Office property, the Gardo House and the Historian Office shall be submitted  to the court, for it to decide as to the ownership, whether it shall go to the  Receiver or be turned back to us. In the case of the Church Pasture, also,  there will be a suit at law to decide upon that, the facts connected therewith  being agreed to by both parties and submitted to the court for decision. The  government also claim, through the Receiver, the Cove Creek Ranch; and $5000.00  more is to be paid to quiet the title of the stock of the Deseret News Co. which  was transferred by President Taylor to the Literary and Scientific Association.  The other temples and the meeting-houses are not officially noticed, the under-  standing being that the title has never been in the Trustee-in-Trust and there-  fore they never have belonged to the corporation, and the acting Attorney General  thought they could not be claimed by the Receiver. Mr. Peters and Mr. Dyer have  returned from Washington, and the former is busy preparing papers and expresses  the hope that he will be ready to submit them to the Supreme Court at the

 OFFICE OF   The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of   Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 14, 1894. 189    Mrs. Leonora Hatch Savage,  Woodruff, Arizona.    Dear Sister:    I was pleased to learn from your letter of 5th inst. of  your welfare and prosperity, and how greatly the Lord had blessed you  in your family. I trust that His mercies will continue with you with  increasing manifestations of His love and watchcare toward you, His   handmaid.    Regarding the questions that you ask, I will say the teach-  ings of the Church have ever been strongly in favor of moderation in  all things. Temperance, soberness and chastity are esteemed among its  cardinal virtues. This moderation should characterize the intercourse  of husbands and wives as well as the other actions of our lives. Many   evils have undoubtedly been wrought in the world by excesses of every  kind, certainly not excepting those that deal with the fountains of  life; and we all, as members of Christ's Church, should endeavor to  approach the perfect law. as nearly as possible, striving to overcome  the weaknesses of our natures by the aid of that Divine Spirit which is  promised to all the children of obedience. These remarks will give you  my general ideas with regard to the subjects on which Sister Sorenseon  treats. I do not wish to be too rigid in asserting the law, knowing  the weaknesses of humanity.    May the Lord lead you in the way of truth is the prayer of  Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff

 HOLINESS TO THE LORD  Salt Lake Temple.  Box 1228. Salt Lake City, Utah, 8 May 1898    Lydia L. Savage,    Dear Sister: In answer to  questions contained your letter of May 30th  I have to say:    It was recently decided by the council  of the First Presidency and Twelve Apostles  that children (deceased) should have  reached the age of 14 years before they should be endowed for.    In relation to sick children, it  is proper to adhere to the revelations,  which directs that the Elders should be  called in that they may administer  the ordinance ordained for the benefit  of the sick. It is not improper, however,  for sisters to administer to the sick children,  but this should not be done by authority   of the Priesthood. 
 Historian's Office,  P.O. Box 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 5, 1887.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    Prof. White, Princi-  pal of the Deaf Mute Dep't. of the  University called and handed  me the enclosed communication  and requested me to forward the  same to you accompanied by  a few lines from myself. Being  somewhat familiar with the class  of unfortunates of whom he speaks  and represents, I take pleasure  in responding to his request, feel-  ing that if there is any portion  of the common wealth who need  the sympathy and support of  the community, it is certainly  those who are deprived of a portion  of their senses as these people are.    I understand from the last   census that there are considerably  over one hundred deaf mutes in  the Territory. The general school  taxes of the Territory does not benefit 
 Salt Lake City  Sept 5th 1887    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Sir:    It is in your  power to be of great service to  a helpless class in the community,  a class that more than any other  people needs the benefits of an   education which areis to fit them  for lives of usefulness in this  hard world of ours, and I am  not without hope from my slight  personal acquaintance with your  kindness of heart and gentleness  of disposition that you will grant   the favor which I am going to ask  for the sake of the unfortunate  children in my care.    When the Legislative Assembly   of 1884 voted an annual approp-  riation of $2000.00 for the   education of the deaf mutes in the   Territory, no provision was  made, probably from an oversight,  for the establishment of an institute  such as is absolutely necessary for  the best development of the Deaf,  mentally, morally and socially.  The need of such an adjunct to the   school was evident to the Board of 
 Fillmore City, Sept. 1882    Bro. Woodruff:    I saw and read your notice to the surviving members of  Zion's camp; and also the editor's remarks on the subject; and after  pondering the matter over, I came to the conclusion that I could  not throw any a ditional light on the travels of Zion's Camp, to  that which Joseph the Prophet wrote, as published in the fifteenth  volume of the Millenial Star. This being the case, I considered  myself perfectly excuseable; but some of my brethren thought  different, who said that inciedents which occurred prior and afterwards  in consequence of the camp, were connected with the travels of the  Camp; and strongly urged me to contribute to the work which you  have taken up. So I have resolved to write and leave it to your  disposal; to use a part or all or none, and if convenient return it   to me when you are done with it.    Some peculiar and thrilling incidents occured in my early  life, which might be interesting to the reader of history, and as some  have remarked; if I had not been born and reared I should not have  been a member of Zion's Camp.    Very Respectfully,  "Nathan B. Baldwin" 
 Copy    Friday, March, 19th, 1897.    Preidents Woodruff and Cannon at the  office.    President Woodruff again spoke into the graphaphone or talking  machine, repeating what he said on the 12th inst., as recorded in  this journal. The object of the repetition was to obtain, oif   possible, better results than wasere obtained on the previous occasion.  In order to procure President Woodruff's signature to the testi-  money he bears, it is herewith repeated and signed by himself:    "I bear my testimony that the Prophet Joseph Smith said, before   a large assemblage in Illinois, that if he were the emperor of the   world and had control over the whole human family he would sustain  every man, woman and child in the enjoyment of their religion.  Those are my sentitments today.    I bear my testimony that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, ordained of God to lay the foundation of his church and king-  dom in the last dispensation of the fulness of times.    I bear my testimony that in the early spring of 1844, in  Nauvoo, the Prophet Joseph Smith called the Twelve Apostles together  and he delivered unto them the ordinances of the Church and kingdom  of God; and all the keys and powers that God had bestowed upon him,  he sealed upon our heads, and he told us that we must round up our  shoulders and bear off this kingdom, or we would be damned. I am  the only man now living in the flesh who heard that testimony from  his mouth, and I know that it was true by the power of God manifest  to him. At that meeting he stood on his feet for about three hours  and taught us the things of the kingdom. His face was as clear as  amber, and he was covered with a power that I had never seen in   any man in the flesh before.    I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was the author of the en-  dowment as received by the Latter-day Saints. I received my own  endowments under his hands and direction, and I know they are true  principles. I not only received my own endowments under his hands,   but I bear my testimony that Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,  Willard Richards, George A. Smith, John Taylor and other brethren  received their endowments under the hands and direction of the  Prophet Joseph; and also my wife Phoebe, Bathsheba Smith, Leonora  Taylor, Mary Smith and others whose names I cannot recall now.    The Prophet Joseph laid down his life for the word of God and  testimony of Jesus Christ, and he will be crowned as a martyr in the   presence of God and the Lamb.    In all his testimoniees to us the power of God was visibly man-  ifest with the Prophet Joseph.    This is my testimony, spoken by myself into a talking machine  on this th 19th day of March, 1897, in the 91st year of my age."    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 3    opening of its next term, which will be towards the last of this month. Brother  Richards thinks, however, that Mr Peters will not be ready by that time.    We have had some hot weather here, but varied  occasionally by cool days and nights. During this week we have had one or two  very cool nights, and since I last wrote to you we have had some very refreshing  showers, which were gratefully received.    Our election has just passed off, and with the  usual hubbub on the part of the Liberals, who have done their best, especially  in this city, to gain their ends. Our ticket, however, with the exception of the  Fifth District, has been elected. Brother Pyper as Justice of the Peace, and  Charles Crow as Constable, were defeated in the Fifth District, and the two  Liberals were elected.    For about a month past Brother Joseph F. Smith  has been severely attacked with lumbago and sciatica. We have not seen him  during that period. He has been confined most of the time to his house, and  part of it to his bed. We hear, however, that he is now improving.    With love, in which Brother Geo. Q. joins, and  praying the Lord to bless you,    I remain, Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff

 Regents, of which Mr. George Q. Cannon  was then chancellor and here I  must say that a more generous,  whole-souled body of gentlemen  I have never seen. The Board re-  commended the needs of the  Department to the last Legislature  in 1886 and an increase of approp-  riation together with an under-  standing that the University should  provide quarters for the accom-  modation of our pupils was  the result but unfortunately,  the veto of Gov. Murray destroyed  our only means of support.  In our time of distress, the Board  generously voted to maintain   the Department for deaf mutes  as before, but nothing could be  done officially for the establish-  ment of an institute. In the   meantime, all our old pupils  had returned to school and there  were many others anxious to  eat the crumbs of education if  any could be obtained. As many  of them come from distant parts   of the Territory, you can understand   that it would not have been good  policy to allow them to board among   strangers who would have no interest 
 this class of individuals, for they  do not nor can they attend the  district or common schools, but  they are entirely dependent for  their education upon special do-  nation and appropriations.    I know from observation that  these people can be made useful   and independent citizens if they  are properly educated. I would,  therefore (not wishing to be in the  least presumptuous) recommend  that if any accommodation can be ex-  tended to Prof. White and his good  lady for the benefit of these poor un-  fortunate fellow beings, via of letting  them occupy the large "Cannon House,"  or a portion of it, for a temporary residence  and school, such favor granted will not  only be duly appreciated by them, but,  in my opinion, be looked upon by the  public as a magnanimous act on the  part of our Church.    As usual, things here at the office  are sliding along smoothly, etc.    Ever praying for your welfare and  protection, I am, as ever,    Your brother in the Gospel,  Milando Pratt

How far from paris?  how large is the stream they water from? what is the wood  & poles, & timber how far to it? how is the winter there  do you raise any corn there or anywhere in bear Lake  Valley? any information you have to give will be thankfully  received.

I told them I was under Brother Richs  jurisdiction, & you had apponted Randolph   for my residence so I must come here &   I am satisfied it is the right place 
 in them beyond that of boarders  and no attempts would be made to   instruct them in good habits and  thus left to themselves, they would  be too apt to pick up bad ones, such   as smoking, chewing and drinking.  Also, which tender mother or loving  father would send away a darling  child or an an innocent young  daughter among irresponsible  persons without anyone to carefully  look after them and watch over  their minds? It is not necessary   to explain this matter further: you  as a parent and as the father of the   Church can understand and  sympathize with the parents of  such children.    There was but one course left to  us in such circumstances  and with the approval of the  Board, my wife and myself  went to work and kept up an  institute during last year. The  county courts rendered valuable  assistance in paying a pro rata   amount for the support of the  pupils. The results of an instituteion  training have been gratifying in   all respects and for a clear des-  cription of its usefulness, I res-

There may  be 10,000 children who will want to see me and hear me speak a little,  so as to remember me when I am gone.

 Mill Creek April 24th 1893    Wilford Woodruff:    Dear brother  having received a notice from  you to take a mission to  California, I feel to respond  to the call; and do the best I   can. Your brother in the gospel    Henry B. Williams    O.K.   J. F. S. 
 pectfully refer you to the last  Annual Report of President J. K.   Park, than whom none was better  qualified to judge upon such  a subject.    The house which we occupied last  year was a large frame house,  inconvenient in many respects  for the proper regulation of our  household, but it was the best that  we could secure. The house however   proved to be damp and unhealthy  to such an extent that our pupils  suffered from colds and rheum-  atic fevers and our own baby, the   only one we have and the only joy  of our existence came near being  carried away by bronchial pneumonia  in that house and my wife was obliged  to live in one room in the next  brick cottage. After the close of   school, the owner tried to rent  the house to other people but its  reputation for unhealthiness  was such that none would take  it and to-day, it is still tenant-  less. Need I say that responsible  as I am for the health of the un-  fortunate children under my  charge, I cannot and must not   go back to such a dangerous place? 
 Please give my respects to bro. Hopkins    The California Mail has just arrived, but no news from you or  San Bernardino.

G. S. L. City, July 30th, 1856.    Brother Rich  Dear Sir,    As Bro. Bullock is writing I will add a few lines.  I passed your wheat field a short time since; the men were harvesting  it—it was middling good; some thought there would be a thousand  bushels of it, but I think not quite so much—it looked well. I was  glad to see you have so much. I called at your house a short  time since, and was in your garden with sister Rich—she gave  me some heads of her Australian wheat, which much resembles  barley in appearance, but when thrashed is a fine looking grain.  I am taking good care of it for seed. Sister Rich was well. James   Townsend has returned from California and Carson Valley, and gives  a bad report of both places—he preached last Sunday upon the subject.  We are having a very dry season, and have hard work to save our  crops—there is but very little water. We are almost universally in the  midst of our wheat harvest; I shall raise wheat enough to bread my  family this year, and perhaps a little more. We are all well excepting  that I am suffering with the rhuematism. I should be pleased to  hear from you at any time. I am trying to get some good apples   and other fruit from abroad to improve my orchards as far Ias I  can; if you can help me any in it I should be thankful.    Yours truly,  W. Woodruff.

 Yet, to this necessity am I reduced  for the want of a suitable building  elsewhere. When I think of it, I am   filled with despair. I have looked   through the whole neighborhood  of the University for a house but  there is none that I could get for  [lone] or money. The Ellerbeck family   owns a fine place but they would  not rent it to us for less than  one hundred dollars ($100) per   month. Of course, that is out of  the question.    There is but one other place which  we could obtain if you are willing  and that is Mr. Geo. Q. Cannon's   large house opposite the "Amelia  Folsom Plalace" It is unoccupied  except by one small family in the  first story and there is plenty of  room in the upper stories that  could be comfortably filled by  our school. Many good people  have asked us why we did not  try to get permission to occupy  this house as it is useless for  any other purposes and is fast  going to ruin. Let us but have the  right to occupy it and we will take  better care of the property so that  it will not be injured in our hands.

 Apostle Woodruff said he was much  pleased to meet so many of the Saints  in conference. Naturally the people  liked to be out taking care of the grain:  considered it quite a marvel to see the  immense crops of grain and other pro-  ducts. But it is right to attend con-  ference and all the other duties.  God would disapppoint no one   in relation to any promise he  has made either in relation to famine  or other calamity or judgment that has  been foretold. He referred to the dis-  persion of the Jews and the causes  that led thereto; said the like causes  were operating in this nation which  tramples under foot its own laws in  order to persecute the Latter-day  Saints. Many had already suffered   death, because of their belief in God,  under this the most liberal government  on earth, while at the same time no  such deeds had been enacted under  any of the kingly governments of Eu-  rope, who made no such pretensions to  liberty and freedom. He believed that   Utah to-day would have been a wil-  derness had it not been for the restora-  tion of the Gospel. 
 I got a Letter from David a few days  ago He has moved into a settlement so  as to do his business with its people  as their Treasurer.

 Apostle Woodruff said this is a Tem-  ple building dispensation. More labor  in this respect is required of the Latter-  day Saints than has been required of  any people since the days of Adam.  He dwelt upon the great labors to be  performed in the redemption of the  dead, reviewed to some extent the   labors of President Brigham Young  in dedicating this land for  the settlements of the Saints, his  having dedicated every place in these  valleys whereon Temples have been   built, or are now in course of  erection; gave a brief synopsis of some  of the labors in the St. George Tem-  ple—a sacred edifice erected, as some  of the brethren declared, in a country  that stands upon its edge. He related   how kindly the Lord had led the Pro-  phet along step by step, until the plan  for the redemption of the dead was  fully revealed. Thought that no doubt  there would shortly follow in the   tracks of those who had been slain, a  set of Elders whom the mob could not  very well withstand; who will have  control of the elements, and by and by   the Savior will come and bind that old  serpent, the Devil, and place a seal  upon him which will remain a thous-  and years, during which time the re-  demption of the dead will proceed. 
 The house belongs to the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  and you, as the President, have  the power of disposing of it as you   think necessary, for, so I have  been told, and I hope for the   sake of the others that you will  find it possible to grant the  use of it to the Department for  Deaf Mutes. We paid $20.00 per   month rent for the other house  last year and will be able to   pay a little more for the Cannon  place if you say so. Any conditions  or restrictions you may see fit   to place upon us will be faithfully  carried out. As every day adds to  the perplexities of our situation, will  you be ^so^ kind enough ^as^ to return an   answer at your earliest convenience.  The use of the house is only to be  temporary. As soon as we can get  our appropriation that may be voted  to our school next Winter, we will  probably have an institution built  upon the University grounds for the  accomodation of all the un-  educated deaf mutes in the Territory.    May I hope that this appeal for human-  ity's sake maywill not fail?    Yours with Respect and Consideration    Henry C. White    Principal

 March 6 [18]93.    Mrs. Eliza Smith,    Dear Sister:    Emma received your letter and would like to accommodate you,  but she did not have the money. In talking the matter over, however, I  concluded to borrow the money for you and herewith enclose you the $110  in post office orders. Please acknowledge the receipt of the same, and  state what the money is to be used for, whether it is to be paid the  government for title to the land, or not.    I also enclose a blank note for your signature, as evidence  of the indebtedness; please sign and return. I hope you will be able to  save your property especially if you are able to get a living on it. Do  not sell it merely for the sake of paying this note of $110.    Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff    P.S.  Not being able to procure Post Office orders, I send you   our State Bank cashier's check instead.

 In Camp, Head Waters Weber River,  Utah Territory, August 24th, 1892.    EDITOR FOREST AND STREAM:    I peruse "Forest and Stream" with much interest: it cer-  contains a great amount of valuable information.    I was born on the 1st day of March 1807, at Avon, Hartford County, Conn.,  on the banks of a trout brook which had turned the wheels of a flour mill  and a saw mill, owned by my grandfather and father, for many years. As  soon as I was old enough to carry a fish-rod I commenced catching trout,  which I have continued to do, from time to time, for nearly 80 years.    Several years of my life were spent in Ashland, Oswego Co., New York, on  the east border of Lake Ontario. While there I assisted, one morning in  catching 500 salmon, very few of which were under 20 pounds, while a few  weighed 40 pounds. My first experience in fishing with fly for trout and  salmon was in England and Scotland in 1845; but I met with little success ^there.^    At the time of the early settlement of Utah Territory, the mountains  and canyons were thickly inhabited with the elk, deer, antelope, panther,  mountain lion, wild cat, and grizzly, cinnamon and brown bear; some of which  were of immense size. These animals are still found in our mountains, and  are frequently killed. I never shot a bear, although I have seen quite a  number of grizzly and cinnamon bears after they were killed. In one in-  stance a very large grizzly, with two large cubs, passed within 30 yards of  me while I was concealed in the brush. I was, at the time, holding in my  hands, a muzzle-loading gun, and the manner she treated her cubs, while ap-  parently trying to wean them, plainly indicated the wisdom of my letting  her pass unmolested, and assured me if I should fail to kill her the first

 shot, she would attack and kill me. Hardly half a mile after passing  she came upon a camp, some of the men fired at her several times but she  got away, with her cubs. I have killed deer and antelope but never elk  although upon one occasion a band of more than 200 came within 300 yards  of me, and were headed towards me, but were frightened off in another direc-  tion by a man without a gun who came running to see me shoot an elk a com-  panion hunter, however, shot and killed one of them. We think deer are in-  creasing in our region. A good many elk and sheep are still in our moun-  tains, but difficult to get at. Deer, antelope and elk are quite plentiful  north of us, in the Snake River country, now Idaho, and moose are taken oc-  casionally. Some six years ago I met a young man up there who shot 16  elk and 2 moose out of one band, and he said he might have killed more, but  in doing would only have been to waste them.    Now concerning the trout of Utah, I will say that Utah, Bear, Panguich  and Trial lake as well as other lakes, rivers and streams abound with the  largest and finest trout; when we first reached [light srebarrow] out [bassins]  country has become settled they that [atsidess] has [insigns] of [aswenemits]  supply quite an amount of trout [9 illegible words]   warm day in June, I helped to make a haul [7 illegible words]  trout having gathered about the river [6 illegible words]  men had made several hauls during the day [5 illegible words]   500 pounds of fish and when the [illegible] I [5 illegible words]  about 1000 pounds. great [8 illegible words]   the scales.

 Trout and salmon have been successfully hatched here, under the super-  vision of Hon. A. P. Rockwood, who is now dead; the eggs having been supplied  by the late Fish Commissioner, Seth Green. The fry were put into Utah Lake  and the tributaries of Bear Lake. Mr. A. M. Musser, our local Fish Commis-  sioner, about three years ago, put into Utah Lake, 1,000,000 shad fry, and I  am happy to say that this effort to stock Utah Lake with shad bids fair to  be a success. Although this fish are as yet protected by law, some of  them, on one occasion, found their way to the market and weighed two and a  half pounds. I assisted Mr. Rockwood, several years before, to put in our  river Jordan 5000 shad fry, but the venture was not a success.    About 12 years ago I visited Bear River valley and fished 4 hours in  a creek leading into Bear River, with a rod and reel, and caught 20 trout,  four of them weighed a little over 4 pounds each. Upon this occasion I  hooked and brought to sight, one trout, I think, of 10 pounds weight; but on  account of the perpendicular height of the bank I could not land him.    Concerning wild fowl: for years our lakes, ponds and streams were alive  with pelicans, geese and ducks; and chickens and sage hens were numerous in  the hills; but as the country is being settled, our feathered game, too, cor-  respondingly diminishes. Chickens are now mostly confined to the distant  hills and canyons. During the last few days we have killed 30 chickens  near our camp. One of our company started a flock and shot 9 times on  the wing, dropping 9 birds, and the 10th shot brought down 2, the balance of  the charge striking the side of a rock glanced and hit a young man as he  was mounting into the saddle. Seven shot lodged in the man and eleven in  the horse the man was hit in the throat, sholder, back of head, and right  knee. Nothing serious, however, resulted from the accident.    Respectfully,    Wilford Woodruff    P. O. Box B, Salt Lake City Utah. 
 terrible than a storm or wreck for when fire gets the control all hope is lost  and persons will plunge into the raging deep to escape its fury. On my  return to the cabin I found one woman in convulsions with alarm and Mrs  Woodruff holding her and she did not get over it until the next day.    On the 19th under a fair wind we crossed  Lake Erie entered the mouth of Welland Canal to go round the Falls into   Lake Ontario on the Canadian side. The canal was 28 miles  long and had 38 locks.    On the 23rd in the Lake Ontario a gale  arose at midnight and during the next day we had a very rough  time and fire again broke out in the midst of it.    Journying on by boat and rail I arrived  at my father's house at Farmington on the 30th. My wife and  children left me on the road several days before to visit her parents  and family.    I had quite an interesting time in visiting  my family and friends in Farmington and neighbouring places  and during my stay there I ordained my uncle Ozem Woodruff  unto the office of High Priest.    My native place & family I left again on the 5th of October and  arrived in Boston two days later. Here I found the eastern churches  were passing through a critical state and I wrote to President Young  giving him an account thereof. Elder J. J. Adams at this time was   holding discussion with O Bachellon at the Malrlbury Chapell. It  was a money getting scheme.    On the 12th I acclaimed in great power  and plainness to the Church in Boston against iniquity in all its forms  informing them Saints that any man from the head to the foot would  be brought to justice if he broke the commandments of God and advised  all to be cautious and for none to throw themselves to ruin because  others do wrong.    I had a convers[at]ion with Bro Whitmore  and he related to me the following dream 
 He had prayed to God to let him see Joseph in a dream and he  fell asleep and dreamt that he saw the heavens opened and beheld some of  the things of eternity. He way a personage rise out of the earth and  an Elder informed him that it was Joseph Smith. Joseph did not speak  to him but droped some slips of paper on the ground from whence  he arose. Brother Whitmore picked up one of them and read upon  it the words--"Emma is not worthy of me." He wished  to read the others but the person with him picked them up and put   them in his pocket and did not let him read them.    After my meeting that evening Elder Adams  and Brannan prefered a charge against Elder Hardy for slander  and the case was to be tried on the following Tuesday.    On the Sunday I met a large congregation  Sister Vose that day gave me 10 dollars and another sister five to  help me on my mission and in the afternoon's meeting a collection  was taken up for the same object making in all about 50 dollars  with the $15 given me at Sister Vose's. At night I attended another  discussion between Adams & Bachellon.    I visited Lowel where there I found Elder  William Smith; and the Branch at that place was in a sad  condition of disatisfaction and in Boston on that evening the trial  was to come off against Elder John Hardy to try to cut him off for  slandering Adams Brannan and William Smith    I was at Gilsum [ink changes] ^N. H.^ [ink changes back] on the 21st where I  arrived with two brethren having rode from Peterboro to Elder Chilon  Mack's son of Solomon Mack. Here I preached in the evening  and spent the night with Solomon Mack aged 72 brother of Lucy  Smith mother of the Prophet Joseph. I spent the evening in  conversation about the Smith's family.    The next day was the last one set by the Millerites  for the coming of Christ. I rode to the old home stead of Mother  Smith where she was born on the side of a hill and the Brook Ashuilek  It was truly a rural place. We rode through Walpole had a good 
 view of Westminster in Vermont called upon several brethren and in  company with Elders Charles A Adams and Alfred Cordon preached in  the evening at the schoolhouse at Drewsville    Next day I was a[t] Peterborough and thence on  the following to Boston where at the Post Office I found a letter from   my wife stating that both her and the children were very sick    I directly started on the next day to my wife  and arrived at Scarborough on the same day and found my wife & children  Here for the next month I was as it were blockaded with sickness  and surrounded with darkness and it seamed as if the Destroyer was  was trying to hedge up my way to hinder me on my mission for  not only my wife and children but a number of her family was afflicted  nigh unto death.    We left our little daughter Phebe Amelia  with my wife's father and mother and on the 21st of November  I started with my wife and youngest child Susan Cornelia for New  York to set sail for England    A Peculiar Dream    While at my father in laws I dreamt a peculiar  dream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. Indeed  I cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thought  I was called to hold with the Twelve the keys of the kingdom in all  the world and I travelled with them over much of the earth  and finally travelled through many countries alone and when  I got through I saw many things which I cannot write and  in the end Joseph Smith the Prophet assissted me to come into  the place where he was and pointed out my work and portion  [change of ink] ^and^ [change back] of labour. I immediately entered into the duties  assigned me.    I also had on the same night another  dream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph 
 and was conversing with him about his death. I told him I felt bad about  it and that had I known he would have been taken away so soon I should  have conversed more with him while living and asked him more questions  He said it was not his fauld I did not. Speaking of my work and duties  he said I had better get a dozen to help me    I    I stoped at Boston on my way and bet with the  Church and cut off eight from the Church who had joined Sydney Rigdon's  faction. This left the Boston Church firm.    On the Sunday Nov 24th after leaving Boston  I was with the Saints in New Bedford with whom I held meetings  that day during which three were baptized    The Monday I spent taking a view of the  city which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to be  surpassed. It is [ink changes] ^the most^ [ink changes back] a noted city for fitting out of walemen.  The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. The  docks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We went  aboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out which  would carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels of  oil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels brought  from the wale country.    I arrived in New York on the  29 where I received a letter from my father and mother in law  stating that Samuel Denning had turned him off from the  mill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to old  age and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the mills  and when they were ready to start and the Winter coming  on he turned him off without notice.    At New York I also received a letter  from President Young in answer to the one I wrote him from  Chicago and several days after its receipt I wrote a long  letter to President Young [ink changes] ^him^ [ink changes back] informing him of the recklessness of  William Smith and George J. Adams during that season 
 I was at the time on a visit to Philadelphia spending  a few days with Jedediah M Grant and the Saints there. I returned  to New York on the fourth of December being accompanied 40  miles on the way by Elder J. M. Grant    The 5th was my last day on shore which  I spent with my wife's brother Ilus F. Carter packing up my trunks  and preparing to leave    We were on board the splendid new  packet ship John R. Skiddy Capt W[illia]m Skiddy with sails  hoisted going out of Sandy Hook about 11 o'clock Dec the 8th  when the pilot left us and we steared on our course.    The company of the brethren and families  consisted of myself wife and child Elder Dan Jones and wife  and Elders Milton Holmes and Leanard Hardy on  mission to England to build up and sustain the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in that land    We had a heavy gale on the 11th and  we were driving under head winds and bare poles during the  day and in the evening about 9 o'clock the gale increased and  it seemed as though the yards would be torn from the mast  We kneeled before the Lord and prayed unitedly that he would  cause the gale to cease and the wind to change that we might  go forward and not backward. In a little time the wind  suddenly ceased and finally changed to the South-west which  gave us fair wind    Christmas day on the ocean which  was the first one I ever spent at sea. We had preserve pudding  for dinner and short cake. We enjoyed ourselves had a light  breeze and one sail in sight    We entered the Irish Channel on the   28th and here we were beating about under foul winds  for some days. 
 A Dream  on the Night of the 30th Dec 1844    I dreamt that I was in council with the martyred Prophet  and Patriarch and also with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles in  America. I thought we had all to be ordained for some purpose  I was called upon by President Young and another person to assist  in administering the ordinances. In the midst of the council Sidney  Rigdon came in and was objected to by Hyrum Smith. I  awoke and again fell asleep and dreamt of being in council  with the Twelve and others. I made an address to them  John E. Page arose to address the meeting but was stoped  by some female and was followed by Elder Willard Snow    I have recorded this dream at the time in  my daily journal yet I did not pay much attention to dreams  on shipboard.    The close of the year found us bearting  about as we had been for several days in the Irish Channel    Synopsis  of the travels and labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1844    I travelled in the United States in many of the principal  places and minor towns and cities in all visiting between 50  and a hundred journeyed through some part of Canada and crossed  the Atlantic making in all a distance of ten thousand and  fifty miles    I held fifty three meetings and attended  ten conferences 
 Councils with the First Presidency & Twelve    I met with the quorum of the Twelve in twelve Councils  and with Joseph Hyrum the quorum of Apostles and   other brethren in transacting the affairs of the kingdom in   thirteen councils    In The Endowments    I attended with Joseph Hyrum and the Twelve  in receiving our endowments twenty one meetings    Baptized for the Dead    I was proxy in the ordinance of baptism for the  dead for nineteen persons.    Baptized Confirmed & Ordained    I baptized for the remission of sins 6 persons and  confirmed 42 and I ordained 1 Patriarch 3 High Priests  25 Elders 9 Priests 3 Teachers and 2 Deacons.

 The New Year at Sea    The new year found me and my family and companions  Dan Jones and wife and Elders Hiram Clark Milton Holmes  and Leonard Hardy still on the Packet ship John I P Skiddy  beating about in the Irish Channel against head wind as we  had been for five days making but little progress    On the 3rd of Jan. we landed in   Liverpool glad to put our feet again on the land after being 27  days at sea. On landing we took a cab and drove to 36  Chapel Street to find Elder Hedlock but no one being in we  spent the night at the Pig & Whistle but the next day I had an  interview with Elders Hedlock and Ward and spent a little time  in talking over affairs.    The 5th was Sunday and we held meetings  in the Music Hall at which myself and companions Elders  Dan Jones, Clark Hardy and Holmes addressed the Saints 
 We boarded several days at Mr Powells No 11 Key Street  From first to last during a quarter of a century and reaching to 20  years later than my present date the Elders boarded with this  Wm Powell and afterward his widow.    Elder Clark and myself then rented two  rooms at Mr. Bagnalls No 38 Highfield St where we  remained several weeks and then rented a house in Dor    In the meantime we had received an interesting  letter from Elder John Taylor and another from President Young  bearing good news of the unity of the Church in America and   that Parley P. Pratt had gone to New York to take charge of  affairs in the eastern churches and publish a paper.    We also on the 16th of the mo[n]ths started  a ^company^ ship load of 100 Saints on the Palmyra for New Orleans  under the Presidency of Elder Amos Fielding and Elders Carnes   and W. Benson his Counsellors.    On Sunday the 19th in the morning  I preached in the Music Hall Liverpool and in the afternoon  as I entered the meeting Elder Ward spoke to me and wished  me to go with him to Manchester and attend evening meeting  as there had been an appointment for an American Elder  to preach. Accordingly we took the rail and arrived  just as the meeting commenced. Elder Ward introduced  me and I addressed the meeting 1 hour and twenty minutes.    Here I again met Elders Leonard Hardy  Milton Holmes and Charles Miller with whom I pleasantly  spent the Monday and returned on the following day to Liverpool    In the 9th No of the Millennial Star  vol [gap between words] there is a long address of mine written to the Saints in the British Islands    About the middle of February I received  letters from Elder John Taylor from Navoo and from   P P Pratt who was presiding over the eastern churches in 
 America and from Jedediah M. Grant in Philadelphia Accompanying  these were numbers of the "Neighbours" and "Prophet" published the   one in Nauvoo and the other in New York and from the Neighbour  I learned of the prospect of more riots and mobs breaking out against   Nauvoo    In company with Elders Leonard Hardy and James   Darling Ross I took rail to Manchester on the 15th of February  to hold a Special Conference the next day which was Sunday    Special Conference  held in  Manchester Sunday Feb 16, 1845.    There were present Wilford Woodruff President of the mission  his Counsellors Elders Hedlock and Ward with five High Priests  30 Elders 31 Priests 21 Teachers and 4 Deacons    We met with the officers before the public  meeting and laid before them the buisness of the day and then  a vast assembly of the Saints gathered in Conference capacity  and we laid before them the changes designed for the Manchester  Conference and it was proposed that Elder Milton Holmes preside  over the Conference and Elder J. D. Ross over the Manchester  branch both of whom accepted this appointment. Sacrament  was then administered which occupied the time till dark.    In the evening we had another [mamoth]  meeting. Elder Hedlock first addressed the assembly and  then he and Elder Ward had to leave for Liverpool   but could scarcely get out of the crowded Hall. I then arose and   addressed the congregation and the Spirit of the Lord was with  us and love and union pervaded the congregation.    It was a scene to make the heart   glad to behold together in a foreign mission so many Saints. 
 writed together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought how  much I should like to see the Prophet Joseph meet with a   Conference of Saints in England but it was not granted  to the British naturi to have the Prophet in their micest [[illegible  to him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands who  heed entered into the New Covenant which God through his mission  had mad unto Israel.    This was one of the must interesting  Conference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilled  a prophecy which I gave in the Sterese of the Snol in Brittaned  in 1837 that I should attend a  Conference with Elder Milton Holmes  in the British Isles    On the 3rd day after our conference I  took the railway cars from Manchester to Bradford where I  arrived at noon and in the afternoon.. Elijah J Sheets arrived  from Leeds. She had come neer from America with  Ekders Stratten and Davis. We were truly glad to meet  each other on a foreign shore and to attend meetings together  in the evening with the Saints of that place. Brother  Sheets was presiding neer the Bradford Conference.    The next day in company with  Elders Sheets and the presidents of the Bradford and Kreffecice  Conferences I left ^wouldve^ to Jolle in Yorkeshire three miles from Bradford  to pay.    [FIGURE]    A Visit to the Grave of Lorenzo Barnes    When we arrived about halfway we had a fair view  of Jolle and the Church yard where for a season was burial  the remains of our beloved brother until the brethren of the  household of faith to which he belonged removed the dusty  the honoured deed to his natural hand and laid it in the  burial place of the Saints. 
 We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before   arriving at Idle which is on which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grass  were as green as in May though it was but February which gave  the landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. We  were walking on the road which our departed brother had walked over  many scores of times to preach the gospel of Jesus and I felt  sorrowful and filled with meditation.    Arriving at Idle containing a population of   seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon   Elder Thomas Cordingly and family who had the care of Elder  Barnes through his sickness and death. They pointed out  to me the house and room where he passed His last hours of   his mortal life.    After partaking of some refreshments we  walked to the Churchyard and reverantly [gussed] upon the peaceful silent  grave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and   sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standing  over the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the "horns of Joseph,"  one of the members of " Zion's Camps" who travelled more than   one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his proseuted  and afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakes  and whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.    While standing upon his grave I offered  up my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the death  of the righteous when called away and that my last end might  be as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacred  dust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection 
 Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder Barnes in company  with my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respect  and remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to the  family who attended him in his last moments I made enquiries  and obtained the following information.    The Cause Sickness & Death of Lorenzo Barnes    One day in the latter part of September 1843  Elder Barnes walled very felt for about thirteen miles to  reach the railway station in time to take the cars. Some  part of the way he ran and got into the [[illegible state of perspiration  and may had time step into the barn just as it was starting  the rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during which  time he became entirely dulled which thro ^gave^ him a severe cold  that setted upon his lungs and brought on quick consumption  from which he mever recovered. He attended Conference and preached  several times afterwards but was very feeble. The last time  he preached was from the passage — "There remaineth therefore  a rest for the people of God". After he was confined to his  bed he was asked if he would have a physician but answered  "No." If he died he would die a natural death. If he lived  he should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto the  Lord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should be  the will of God that he might return to Nauvoo. He was  deprived of his reason during some portem of the time and his  whole conversation on which intervals would he about Nauvoo  how he should yet there and his friends. The spoke up his  another frequently. The night before his death he had his  reason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of the  truth of the fretness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints 
 I also learned that Elder Barnes suffered by going with  poor boots and wet feet from place to place. he was slow to make his  wants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to the  until he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after he  was confined to his bed but then it was too late.    I enguired if there were any writings left by   him such as Journals etc but could find nothing excepting several  fragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intended  wife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristic  of the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments I  copied from his M. S. into my daily Journal.    I preached to a good congregation at Idle that evening  and the next day in company with Elders Sheets and Ure and Abraham  Lord the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to Bradford.    The brethren placarded the town with following  notice:    Conference: _ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints will hold their Conference in the Philadelphia Chapel North Wing  Bradford on Sunday Feb 23rd 1844; to commence at ten o'clock in the  morning two in the afternoon and six in the evening; when there will  be present on the occassion two Americans, one of whom belongs to  the quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Also there will be preaching on the   fulness of the everlasting gospel as revealed by an angel of the Lord in  these last days on the following ^every^ Monday Tuesday and Wednesday  in the said chapel to commence at eight o'clock each evening. N. B.  People of all Persuasions are invited to attend    This Conference was duly held according to   notice of which I here give the epitome  -------------------------- 
 Bradford Quarterly Conference  held in the   Philadelphia Chapel Bradford Yorkshire  Feb 23, 1845    Present: Wilford Woodruff of the Quorum of the Twelve 1 High Priest  1 Seventy 9 Elders 9 Priests 6 Teachers and 4 Deacons    Elijah F. Sheets the President of the Conference  was called to the chair and Priest Beecroft chosen clerk    The meeting being duly of opened the Conference  was represented consisting of three Branches — Bradford Leeds  and Jolle numbering in the whole 111 members.    Thou was a good member of the Saints  gathered together and an excellent band of music in front of the  pulpit accompanied the singers. In the morning Elder Woodruff  addressed the meeting.    The chapel in the afternoon was crowded  with the Saints and citizens. Sacrament was administered  and I again addressed the congregation but was somehwat interupted  by a man into [[illegible who had been cut off the Church.    In the evening we again had a crowded  house and the music and singing which commenced our service  was inspiring. It fell to my lot once more to address the  congregation during the evening and I took for my [tess] the  XIV of Rev to 7 & [[illegible verses. In my deseranse I gave an account of  the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of God  by the administration of angels and traced the subject through to  the sealing of his testimony with his blood.    I spoke for the space of one hour with  the power of God and the congregation as still as death and  a most intense interest prevailed. During the Conference 
 I conformed 4 persons blessed 3 children and laid hands upon twelve persons for   the healing of their infirmaties.    Two days afterwards I returned to Liverpool stoping  on the way several hours at Manchester which I spent with Elder Holmes    March the 1st was my birthday and I was thirty eight   years of age and in Liverpool presiding over the British Mission and with one  my wife    An Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright of  The Book of Doctrine and Covenants    On my birthday I received a letter from a friend  containing the copy of a letter dated Pittsburgh Jan 30, 1845 written by  John Greenhow to his father in Kendal stating that he was getting the  Doctrine and Covenants sterotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going to  bring the plates to England to print the work here and get the copyright secured  so that the Church could not print them it    This was indeed a bold move of the apostates to  undertake the undertake to print the works of the Church and such a  book as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of the  Church and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of God  which ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyright  into my hands. I spent the day in examining the law of   England upon the securing of copyright.    I spent the forepart of the following day at  home and the afternoon with Elders Hedlock and Ward upon whom at this  time I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors and they then  laid their hands upon me and blessed me.  Afterwards we partook  of the sacrament together and then we called upon God our Father to  bless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow the  designs ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause 
 of God.    I wrote President Young giving him account of the  affairs of the mission and informed him of the deep laid scheme  of those at Pittsburg, America._ John Greenhow Samuel Benett  and others to rob the Church of the copyright of the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants. I also wrote to the Secretary at  Stationers Hall to secure the Copyright of the work myself for  the Church and wrote to brother Cureden to send me a copy   of the Doctrine and Covenants    Preston Quarterly Conference was held   on Sunday the 9th of March at which myself and Elder Ward  attended. Elder John Banks was called to the chair. During  the day Elder Leonard Hardy was chosen to preside over the  Conference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505  members    Next day I took a walk through the city and  visited the old Cookpit where Elders Kimball and Hyde had  preached so much at the first opening of the British mission and  where also Dr. Willard Richards afterward also preached.    We walked up and down the river where  many hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also [traveled]  the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the   yallout enthusiastic followers ^[every]^ of the Young Pretender made ^their^ illfated  and mad attempt  to unseat the first George from the English  throne and praise it to their bonnie Charle. ^[Washed] it the house of the Stewarts^ Some of the Scotch  entered the town as far as the Cookpit but most of them was  slain in the Valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a   grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745  just one hundred years before this date.    We returned to the town and aftr dinner  I took the parting hard of Elders Banks and Hardy and the  Saints of Preston and returned to Liverpool 
 Lord Nelson's Monument Liverpool.    In company with my wife and Sisters Clark and Haywood  I visited Nelson's Monument the design of which was made by Mathew  Charles Wyatt of London and was executed in bronze by Richard  Westmacott also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble by  Messrs [Misters] Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscription  to build it commenced on the 15th of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the same  year amounting to £ 9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812    The principal figure is Admiral Nelson  resting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a [cannok] his eye  stedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourth  naval crown upon his swourd held in his left hand indicating the loss of  his right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victory  is lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Deathlies  in ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the   stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged British  Sailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of its  most illustrious chief and in the back ground is Britanuia leaning on  her sphere and shield with lauaral in her hand but she's regardless of them  representing the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darly  purchased.    Around the upper moulding of the pedestal are  inscribed Nelson's ever memorable words _ "England expects every man  to do his duty". At the base of the pedestal are four figures in  chains as captines emblematical of the four great victories he achieved and  the space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by four  grand bass reliefs executed in bronze ^also^ representing those glorious  victories _ namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;  Copenhagen 2nd of April 1801; Trafalgar 21st of Oct. 1805. The  figures are all of the proportion of seven feet. Lord Nelson was 
 born Sep. 29, 1758.    The whole range of the buildings called the Exchange  cost £ 110,848; Flaging £ 36,000; Town Hall £ 156,000.  After visiting this monument we went through several  of the principal ^struts^ and viewed them and then returned home .    The day following which was the 13th  I took the steamer Commodore for Glasgow in company with  Elders Hedlock Ward and Banks and arrived at the mouth of  the river Clyde at 6 o'clock next morning.    We passed Gourock, Greennock, Port Glasgow  Dumbarton at the mouth of the river Leven at which stands the   rock so noted in Scotish history and called Dumbarton Castle  on which is stationed a regiment of soldiers to protect the river  Clyde.    We had a fair [revial] of Bell's monument  erected in memory of John Bell who was the first to run a steamer  up the river Clyde to Glasgow which is confined to its banks  by a stone wall for sixteen miles.    The Highlands were covered with snow  and we arrived in Glasgow in the midst of a severe snowstorm.    In the evening we held a Council with the officers of the Branch and two days afterwards which was  the 16th we held.    The Glasgow Conference    at the Odd Fellow's Hall Glasgow    The meeting was called to order by Deter  Peter McCue was called to the chair and aAfter singing and  prayer 15 Branches of the Church was represented containing  1065 members 35 Elders 51 Priests 37 Teachers 24 Deacons.  Then Gibson was clerk of the Conference.    During the day the vast assembly 
 of the Saints was addressed by Elders Hedlock Ward Banks and myself. I  felt much interested in this my first visit and Conference among the Scotish Saints    Next day I called ^took the^ rail to Coats Bridge and thence went  to Whifflett and held a Council with the officers of that Branch and the following  morning I took a walk to visit Dunbyrian Fun Works. From thence we visited ^walked^  to Ashley and called upon the brethren there and then visited  the extensive Calder-Banks Mallable Fun Works    I next visited the Ardrie Museum  collected and kept by Mr. Jonnes Myrdock antiquarian. After taking  some refreshments with him he showed us each appartment of the Museum  and among the many curiosities I had a [vieal] of coins from about 1000  years before Christ down to the present day. Among the rest were  coins bearing the names and profile of Riblios 1100 B.C. Antonius,  Vespersion Caesar, Servius, Christian era, Cornodus, Posthurmus,  Artaxses, Fragin, Domician, Antonins, Gordian, Auridlsian, Hiradien,  Claudius Caesar, and Pins.    There was quite a collection of natural History  and three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I [seen]  also a metal pot bearing this inscription: _"One Hundred and   twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence". I also saw  three gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travelers from the Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of war  and paintings of ancient date.    Afterwards we called at a brothers house and I  laid hands upon six who were sick and blessed twenty persons who pled  with me to let them have a blessing under the hand of an Apostle.  I   preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to   brother [barruthers] and spent the night.    I dreamt a rattle snake bit me on the ancle but I  pulled him off squezed him to death and much poison can out of  him. The interpretation was that when we arrived at Edinborough  I should be opposed by for appointing  John Banks to preside over that Branch and Conference after 
 Returning to Glasgow and joining Elders Hedlock and  Ward we took the rail to Castle Carery and thence by coach to Sterling  and as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fine  view of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroic  Wallace & the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free Scotland from  the English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace in  one of his most famous acts.    Arriving at Sterling we called upon  Elder Daniel Sutherland in John Street and took supper and  then called upon John Gillies 76 years of age. He was the third  man in the founation of the 92 Hounders was in the army for  21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his age.  I had an interesting conversation with him during the evening  and we spent the night at his house  Sterling Castle. Next morning with brothers Hedlock Ward  and Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartment  of it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castle  we closely examined the palace of Mary Queen of Scots and the King's  stables and went into them!    In going through the old castle we saw  the armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity. We   went into into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oak  pulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince Henry  I brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon the  spot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and   produced his first sermon. Here I also saw the place in  the old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figures  which Knox destroyed before commencing his shermon and fierce  denunciation against [posseny] and [visage] worship. He also had  a view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 1639 and  Cemens Hospital and the place where James the VI (6) was crowned.  We had a pleasant view of Streling Castle and the surrounding   country from its heights. 
 While at Sterling's I said my hands upon the veteran John  Gillies and beheld him and sustained him an Elder and on the third day  from our arrival we took at team back for Edenborough where we arrived at  seven oclock and after taking some [refrethmments] at [Heenry cHeEll can;] the  Residing Elder we went to the meeting    This was the first time I had we been in Edenborough  and the Edenborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state for  many aspiring spritis were there and had been manifested for a length  of time. I prayed You to give us wisdom to set this conference  in order.  ^Edinborough Castle.^ [FIGURE]  Next day we renewed the renowned city of Edenborough  and visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From the  castle we had a splended view of the city of Edenborugh and surrounding  country for many miles. The [welp] itself which forms the [FIGURE] itself  the castle is three hundred and eighty 3 feet aboce the level of the sea and  is accessable only on the cotton sicle the other [illegible] being nearly perpendicular    The castle is of great antiquity and has been held  as a fortress from the earliest times. In 1093 it was believed by Donald  ^Bame^ brother to king Medrolun; taken by the Eighth in 1296,_retaken and  demolisthed by [Rauelohth] 1313,_ rebuilt by Edward the III of England,_  [illegible] by them.

They were placed there in 1707 and acsended in an often chell in the   crown room in 1818. This is King David's crown, first being of   Scotland    I [illegible] inspected the celebrated piece of antiquary   called Mons cheg colt at [illegible] in Slauders. He was used in the  seize at Norham and afterward first in [firving] a salute to the Duke  of Clark on his visit to the castle in 1682. He was forged in  1486 and of large bars of rim. His weight was seven and half tons  and it carried 268 pound shot, the Lord was heavenly involved and 
 its length fifteen feet.    After visiting the Armowry and going through  each appointment at the castle and taking the yuletied view of   the surrounding country we left and visited other portions of the  city and among the rest saw. The old house where John  [Lomok] the Scotish Performer was born May 2nd 1505 and  died Nov. 24, 1572.    Visit to the Palace of Holywood    We next visited the palace of Holywood. [illegible] the  site of an Abbey which was founded by David the I. in 1128  and which was one of The richett religious establishments in Scottland  in the chapel ^of the palace^ were deposited The remains of David II; James II; Prince  Ar49 thur [illegible] son of James IV; James V; Magolalene lu's queen;  Arthur Second son of James V, and Henry Darnley. The  ruins of [illegible] is now called The Chapel Royal is worthy of notice    The Picture Gallery of Hoolywod which  is 1376 feet long by 271/2 wide and 20 feet in height continues  the portriats of the Scotish monarchs. 
 to an attentive congregation.    A company of young men who called themselves  the Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and they  led us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat which  was the highest peak of wales anywhere in this region and a good part  of the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed that  Elder Orsen Pratt while he was establishing the Brach in Edinborough  which he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of the  world in London, would frequently go to the top of this rock as a  place of retreat and meditation.    From this rock we had a full view of  the whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country which  presented to us a [shelelinal] prospect. I was quite unwell with  a severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rock  or Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brestren  as far as fatigue was concerned.    When we had sufficiently viewed the  country around we relumed took dinner and then visited several  of the Saints and in the evening we held a crucial meeting  of the officers.    The day after we parted with the Saints   in Edinborough took the rail to Georgia where we spent 3 hours  with the brethren then continued by rail to [Grenodp] and  thence by steamboat for Liverpool. Elder Hedlock and  myself were together; brother Ward had been left in Edinborough  by accident.    We had a disgreaable night on board and  I arrived in Liverpool sick and weary and for several day continued  unwell and mostly unfit for business.    On my return I received several of  numbers of the Saines and Seasons and Neighhour and  the New York Prophet also a letter from Elder George  A Smith.

I met with  the Saints that evening in Birmingham    I remained in Birmingham several days  and then went unto the Potteries Stafferdshire from thrice I went to  Manchester and on the 9th of July returned to Liverpool    On the 18th of the same month my wife Phebe  gave birth to a fine son to whom I gave the name of Joseph on  the 9th day of his age when I blessed him in the arms of his mother    I continued my Presidential labours in and around  Liverpool being most of the time in the office with August the  22nd when I took the train to Manchester and next day continued 
 to Sheffield where we held conference the next following day & returned to Liverpool three  days afterwards were Here I remained but two days and then attended the [Pres] Conference  held August the 31st and returned again to Liverpool on the 1st of September.    On the 6th of this month I forwarded the trunk of [Adler]  Lorenzo-Barnes to President Young by Elder Houston who went on board of the  Oregon with a number of others of the Saints.    On the 13th with my wife and 2 children I left  Liverpool to attend  The Manchester Quarterly Conference  held Sep 14th    There were represented twenty four branches at this time  composing the Manchester Conference with a total of one thousand seven  hundred and sixty nine members including 44 Elders 99 Priests 37 Teachers  and 27 Deacons. 
 Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles        [13 lines blank]    On the 24th I met with Elders Hedlock and [Ward]  and [laid] before them my feelings concerning our situatin in  Liverpool both temperally and spiritually. There had not  been a good understanding between us for some time but I told  these brethren what I wished to be done and seemingly our  meeting was profitable and at the close of our consultation we  bowed our knees together before God.         Towards the latter end of the follow[ing]   month I received intelligence from President Young that  the State of Illinois would not protect the citizens of Nauvoo  and that the only terms of peace [granted] at all was upon condition  of our people leaving the State. The Presiding of the Church and  the community themselves had been under the necessity of agreeing  to leave the State of Illinois the next Spring. I wrote in   return to President Young expressing my feelings [severely] upon  this extermination of the Saints and asked his counsel whether  I should tarry in England or return to America. I also sent  him a duplicate of the entering of the copyright of the     
 Books of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants        I also notified the Presiding Elders of the British   mission of a Special General Conference to be held at Manchester  on the 14th day of December 1845.        I then left Liverpool and attended the [Glasgow]  Conference held Sunday October ^Nov[ember]^ the 30th and returned again to Liverpool  on the 3rd of December and on the 13th with Mrs Woodruff  I took train to Manchester.        Special General Conference  of the  British Mission  held at  The Hall of Science Manchester Dec. 14, 1845.        The Conferences of the British Mission were [illegible]  containing a total of eleven thousand and thirty two members  with one of the quorum of the Twelve 8 High Priests 392 Elders  590 Priests 311 Teachers and 188 Deacons and 1573 bapitized [during]  the last eight months. The statistics of the Staffordshire  Conference was not included in this total        Thus had the work of God in ^the^ British  Isles in a few years grown into a mighty mission         This Special Conference was continued  through two days and much important business was taken up  and arrangments made in view of my return to the United States  and ^and^ the emigration expulsion of the Saints and the general affairs of  the mission discoursed upon.        I spent the day following the Conference  with the Saints in Manchester and bid them farewell and  next day returned to Liverpool     
 St John's Market Liverpool on Christmas Eve        My wife and I paid it a visit. It was a fine  sight. The best of beef mutton pork [veal] and prize bullocks sheep  lambs[&e] [uncut] filled their department of the Market House game  and poultry of every kind [crowded] its department and fruit from  almost every country and clime was heaped fancifully on its  numerous decorated stalls and the whole body of the market was  hung with evergreen. After we had viewed St John's Market  we returned home and at eleven o'clock at night we attended        High Mass In the Catholic Chapel  Scotland Road Liverpool.        This was the first time in my life that I had ever attended  High Mass in a Catholic Church.         I and my wife eat our Christmas dinner  at brother and sister Euion's with whom our daughter Susan  Cornelia had been for some time living and in the afternoon we  all attended a general [tise] meeting of the Saints held at the Music  Hall in Liverpool with a company of 3 or 4 hundred Saints         A few more days past and the year  1845 had rolled round and I and my family ^in^ Liverpool continuing  my second mission to the British Isles.

I baptized 2 confirmed 41 blessed 23 children  and administered to 90 sick persons        Ordinations        I ordained three to the office of the Sevent[ies]  seven Elders eight Priests one Teacher and two Deacons.        Letters Written and Received        I wrote four hundred and seven letters and received 379        Publishing in 1845        I published 3000 copies of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants  in Liverpool and this was the first European edition. I also  published 3000 copies of the Hymn Book and 20,000  copies of the Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles        Copyright of the Book of Doctrines & Covenants        I secured the copyright of the First European Edition  of the Book of Doctrines and Covenants in the name of Wilford Woodruff  at Stationers Hall London June the 7th 1845        Funds for the Temple        I collected three hundred and seventeen pounds twelve shillings for  the Temple of the Lord in Nauvoo.     
 On New Years day I wrote Elder Samuel Downy  a letter and sent him as a New Years Gift some hair from the  heads of Joseph Smith the Prophet and all the male members of  his father's ^the Smith^ family and also some of the hair of Joseph's mother and  most of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles with a piece of  the Prophet's handkerchief        On the 3rd I left Liverpool for   Preston and preached on the Sunday        The Glasgow Conference sent me eleven  pounds three shillings and the Manchester Conference 42   pounds and Birmingham six pounds to assist me and my  family to return to America. I gave out of this 12 pounds  to Elder Clark        On the evening of the 10th I made  a feast for a few of the brethren before my departure     
 and had for my guests Elders Hedlock Ward Clark Wilson and Downes        Next day was Sunday and the last but one  of my stay in England on this mission. I communed with the Saints  and delivered in the evening my farewell address.        The following week was a very busy one  in preparing for our own emigration and the sending off of a small  company of the Saints        On the 16th I went on board of the Ship  Liverpool with my family and about 40 others of the Saints. Elders  Hedlock Fielding McChacie and myself ^I^ ^and^ went out with the ship ten  miles and I then parted with my family and the company of Saints  on board and returned with the above ^several^ brethren in a small boat to  Liverpool for I could not go for some days but had to leave my  wife and children to cross the Atlantic without me and tarry  myself for some days to settle my business and the affairs of the  mission.         As the 21st was the last day of my time  on shore I was determined to make some settlement of my affairs  before going on board of the ship and this I had found hard to  accomplish. Elders Ward and Hedlock had so much business of  their own to do that they had done but little to help me in the  settlement of mine and what they should have done had been  put off by them to the last minute. This made it very hard   for me. I had to [illegible] along alone and none to help and Elder  Ward especially had manifested great indifference and neglect towards  me. However I struggled through it by the help of God and   also overthrew a design to partly rob me of the little means I had  This design I had every reason to believe was concockted by Mr  James the Printer and a professed friend standing near me in   office and interest.        But I succeeded this this day in effecting a final  settlement and the statement showed that I left the printing   department of the Church with property in excess of debts     
 574 pounds 16 shillings and one penny.        After regulating the accounts and writing        My Valedictory For the Star        all in the midst of a whirl of business I bade farewell to Elders  Hedlock Ward and Wilson and others around ^and^ with Elder Joseph  A. Stratton I went on board the packet ship Ashburton  of the Swallowtail line bound for New York with its  passengers and crew        We hoisted anchor and was towed out  into the channel by a steamtug on the morning of the   23 of January. The tug left us about 15 miles out  and we set sail and went on our course        My wife and children with a company  of the Saints were crossing the Atlantic for New Orleans on  the Ship Liverpool and I now commencing my voyage  accross to New York. It was designed that my wife  with the two children with her should go direct towards Nauvoo  and I by the way of New York to fetch my daughter Phebe  from my wife's sister ^Sarah [Gross]^ in Sc^arborough^ and also  to take with me to Nauvoo my Father and Stepmother        Man Overboard        About a week after we set sail during a   roughish ^[illegible]^ day the second mate steped forward to the bow  of the ship and ordered one of the hands to do something on  the [bowsprit] who refused upon the [plea] that it was  dangerous and at the risk of his life. The mate replied  that he would not ask a man to do a thing he was not  willing to do himself and forthwith attempted the task  At the same moment we shipped a sea which instantly     
 TEMPLE MANIFESTATIONS.    ST. GEORGE AND MANTI TEMPLES.    On the 1st of January, 1877,   President Brigahm Young, the Apos-  tles Wilford Woodruff, Erastus Snow  and Brigham Young, Jr., with two  thousand or more Saints, assembled  within the St. George Temple, for  the purpose of dedicating certain  portions of it unto God, that we  might be prepared to commence  giving endowments, sealings, and  other blessings unto the Saints. At  12:30 o&apos;clock, Apostle, now Pres-  ident Wilford Woodruff, stood on  the upper steps of the font and  called attention of the people,  and said: "We are this day blessed  with the privilege that but few since  the days of Adam, have ever en-  joyed. But few of the sons of Adam  have ever hadthe privilege of enter-  ing into a Temple built by the com-  mandment of God, in which to  administer ordinances both for the  living and the dead. We have now  assembled to dedicate portions of  this Temple unto God; and I have  a request to make of all the Saints  who are present, and I suppose all  who are, profess to be Saints, for 
 none others should be here. I   realize that this assembly cannot bow  the knee in their crowded condition,  but you can bow your heads and  your hearts, before God, and this I  want you to do this day. And the  words of those who offer up prayers.  in the dedication of this Temple, I  want repeated, in secret, by this  assembly before the Lord, that our   prayers may ascend unto the ears of  the Lord of Saboath, that they may  be answered upon our heads. The  Saints do not prize, as they should,  the blessings they enjoy."    "The Spirit of God like a fire is   burning," was sung.    Apostle Erastus Snow announced  that Elder Wilford Woodruff would  offer the dedicatory prayer. Presi-  dent Woodruff kneeling on the  upper steps of the font, offered the  prayer of dedication.    We did bow our heads and hearts,  —our whild being was mellowed by  the Holy Spirit, and the occasion  that brought us together. A few  words of that prayer will be in place  here:    "Oh God, our Heavenly Father,  Father of Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob. Thou who hast created the  heavens, the earth, the seas and  fountains of living waters, and all   things that dwell therein. Accept of  the gratitude of our hearts and the  thanksgiving of Thy people, that  Thou hast preserved our lives, to  again enter into another Temple,  which has been built by Thy Saints  in these valleys of the mountains, in  which to organize the Holy Priest-  hood and to administer the ordi-  nances of the Gospel of the Son of  God, both for the living and the  dead. Oh, our God, we Thy sons  and daughters have assembled to-  gether, in the name of Thy Son  Jesus Christ, within the walls of this  Temple, this day for the purpose of  dedicating and consecrating a portion  of this House unto the Lord our   God; that it may be holy and accept-  able in Thy sight. May the prayers  of Thy people ascend unto Thine  ears, O Lord, and be heard and  answered upon their heads." 
 Mountain Standard Time.    To the Presidents of Stakes and the   Bishops of the Different Wards.    Dear Brethren—It has been con-  templated for some time to facilitate  travel and regulate time in the United   States.    Owing to the extent of the country   and the great change of time, as be-  tween its extreme east and extreme   west, the distance between which  points being nearly 4,000 miles; and   as there is to each thousand miles a   change of an hour approximately in   the meridian, it necessarily makes a  change of four hours from east to   west. The rapid transit of passen-  gers in trains from one place to an-  other makes it very inconvenient for  passengers going either east or west,   and the changes are so rapid that it   renders their time pieces compara-  tively useless. The railroads and tel-  egraph lines especially have found it  necessary to adopt a time or times of  their own to suit their own conveni-  ences, and to comply as far as practi-  cable with the local meridian time of  the several districts of country  through which they pass. In some   cities it made it extremely difficult   both for the passengers and also for   the railroads, as well as for the inhab-  itants of the city, who desired to trav-  el as, frequently there would be from  two to six different times in the same  city adopted by the railroads passing  through in different directions; and   as there is so great an amount of  travel, it became very annoying, not  only to travelers but to parties resid-  ing in those cities who were more or   less controlled by those circumstan-  ces.    Numerous plans have been pro-  posed and theories introduced to cor-  rect this evil, principally, at first, in   the interest of railroads and telegraph  lines, all of which proposals, until  quite recently, have been rejected as  tending to confusion. But at length  a plan was proposed to be introduced  to regulate the time of the whole of   the territory to the United States, and   to have all the cities and towns em-  braced in the several States and Ter-  ritories conform to a general regula-  tion on the subject, so that difficul-  ties which were very perplexing and  annoying might be avoided, both in  regard to railroad travel and also to   the inhabitants of cities. The plan   proposed is to make four dif-  ferent divisions of time, named  the Eastern, Central, Mountain, and  Pacific divisions, extending from the   extreme east to the extreme west,   varying in some slight degree from  direct lines north and south to meet  circumstances and to avoid confusion;   leaving it, of course, as an open ques-  tion to the local authorities of the   States, Territories, municipalities, and  districts to adjust these matters agree-  ably to their own feelings, and sub-  ject more or less, to their action.   This state of things reduces the dif-  ficulty to a minimum of variation  which was thought at one time impos-  sible to accomplish, and the change  from one division to another is al-  ways exactly of one hour, without  any perplexing odd minutes or sec-  onds.    The difference between the present  plan, and the state of things that be-  fore existed is that whereas before,  there were more than fifty variations   of time in the United States, the pres-  ent plan will reduce it to four, and if  generally adopted it will prevent  much confusion that has heretofore  existed on this subject.    It would seem from accounts that  the cities of Washington, New York,   Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, St.   Louis, Omaha, Denver, and other  prominent cities east have adopted  the regulations, in accordance with   what is now called the "Standard   time" in contradistinction to local   time, and that the 75th, 90th, 105th,   and 120th meridian west of Green-  wich have been selected as initial   points from which to calculate the  time. Each of these points are 15 de-  grees (or approximately 1,000 miles)   apart; and dividing this 1,000 into  two, one slower and the other faster,  no greater change than 30 or 35 min-  utes can occur in the most extreme   points, while in many places there  will be very slight variations from  their local times or meridians.    If this had been simply a railroad  or telegraphic change for the accom-  plishment of their business transac-  tions, it need not have effected the   local time of any of the cities or   towns of the United States or Terri-  tories. But as it has been found that  it would be beneficial to the general   interests of the whole nation, it be-  comes necessary for us to calmly and  intelligently investigate the subject,   and if found practicable, to comply  therewith throughout our Territory,   in our various cities, towns, and vil-  lages, that we may be in harmony   with the States and Territories   throughout the country.    With us the proposed change would  be twenty-eight minutes faster in  Salt Lake City than our meridian   time, and it would necessitate a simi-  lar change to be made throughout   our whole Territory, and as our settle-  ments extend several hundred miles   nearly north and south, it would   make very little difference in the   longitudinal or mean time of any of   them.    About the year 1860, some officers   in the service of the United States  Geological Survey, I believe, came  here and were desirous of having an  initial point for astronomical, electri-  cal, geodetical and other scientific   purposes, which was decided to be in  the Temple Block, and President  Young, in accordance with their wish-  es, caused a large square block of stone  to be provided, whereon to place their  instruments, and whence a base line  was laid to regulate the United States   and other surveys. We have since    then had instruments in the Presi-  dent's Office for the computation of  time, and a gentleman appointed who   was competent to take observations   and adjust our time on strictly scien-  tific principles. From these obser-  vations our city time has been regu-  lated from that period to the present,  and the correct time has been tele-  graphed twice a week to the various   telegraphic stations in our Territory;  and if thought proper to change to   what is called Standard time it will  simply make the difference of adding  twenty-eight minutes to our meridian  time and thus place us in harmony   with the nation in regard to this pro-  posed change, and that time once be-  ing adjusted here can be telegraphed  as heretofore to the whole of the Ter-  ritory, and thus and same uniformity   prevail as has hitherto existed, and   all confusion be avoided, so that every  part of the Territory will be governed   by the same time, and no confusion  or trouble exist; besides it will place  us in harmony with the United States  in this contemplated improvement.    Salt Lake City and Ogden have al-  ready, through their Municipal Coun-  cil, adopted the Mountain Standard  time, and we recommend that the  people of the Territory generally   adopt this time, and suggest that the  county, city, and town officials  throughout the Territory meet in   their several capacities at an early day   and pass measures to adopt what is  called the "Mountain Standard" time,  and then we can adjust our time as  formerly by the Salt Lake meridian,  adding the difference between that   and the Standard time, and having   this time, as heretofore, telegraphed   twice a week to the various telegraph   offices throughout the Territory,   which will avoid confusion and place  us in harmony as to time with all  parts of our Territory and also with   what is now termed the Standard   Time of the United States.

 AN EPISTLE.    Apostle Woodruff's Cheering Coun-  sels to the Saints.    To the Saints Scattered Abroad; Greet-  ing:    DEAR BRETHREN: I feel desirous to  express myself upon the present con-  dition of Zion and its inhabitants.  The history which we are making as  Latter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil-  ment of the revelations of God, as  given through the mouths of Prophets  and inspired men to the inhabitants  of the earth in every dispensation  when God has had an acknowledged  people on the earth. The God of  heaven, who created this earth and  placed His children upon it, gave  unto them a law whereby they might  be exalted and saved in a kingdom of   glory. For there is a law given unto  all kingdoms, and all things are  governed by law throughout the  whole universe. Whatever law any-  one keeps he is preserved by that  law, and he receives whatever re-  ward that law guarantees unto him.  It is the will of God that all His chil-  dren should obey the highest law,  that they may receive the highest  glory that is ordained for all immor-  tal beings. But God has given all  His children an agency, to choose  what law they will keep.    These two principles do exist—  good and evil; God and the Devil.  Whatever leads to good and to do  good is of God. Whatever leads to  evil and to do evil is of the Devil.  God has labored from the creation of  man to lead him to keep the celestial   law, that he may inherit a celestial   glory and partake of eternal life, the  greatest of all the gifts of God to man:  while the Devil, with all the fallen  angels, has labored from the creation  to lead man astray, to lead him down  to the perdition of ungodly men, that  he may have dominion over him.    These two principles have governed  and controlled the acts of all the chil-  dren of men, and laid the foundation  for all the history of the whole world  for the last six thousand years, or  from the creation of man. This  power of the Devil, and of all the   fallen angels, who are represented to  have been one-third part of all the  hosts of heaven, who were cast down  from heaven to earth, has been at  war against God and His Christ, and  against every Prophet and Apostle   and inspired man whom God has  raised up, from the creation of the  world to the present day. The first  man, Adam, under the influence of  the Devil, transgressed a law by  which death came into the world. [##Genesis 3:1-6##]  God the Eternal Father gave His only  begotten Son, as a great sacrifice, to  shed His blood to redeem man from  death. For as in Adam all die, even  so in Christ shall all be made alive. [##1 Corinthians 15:22##]    The God of heaven, whom we wor-  ship, is represented as the Father,  the Son and the Holy Ghost. The  Father and Son have tabernacles, and  they created man after their own  image. But the Holy Ghost is a  spirit and a witness and a testimony  of the Father and the Son. This  Holy Ghost and witness are promised  unto all men who will obey the law  of the Gospel, which God has re-  vealed to the human family. This  Holy Ghost rested upon Adam when  he blessed his posterity in Adam-  ondi-Ahman, three years previous to  his death.    The Lord gave unto Adam and  many of his sons the Holy Priest-  hood, whereby they could administer  in the ordinances of the Gospel of  life and salvation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] The Lord has  raised up men in every dispensation,  when He has had a people on earth  unto whom He has given the Priest-  hood, and all people have been   blessed when they have hearkened to  the voice of the Lord. On the other  hand, when the inhabitants of the  earth have become wicked, and have  transgressed the law of God, they  have been chastised, and when they  have become ripened in iniquity they  have been cut off from the earth, as  in the case of Noah and Lot, and "as  it was in the days of Noah, so shall it  be also in the days of the Son of  Man." [##Matthew 24:37##] The righteous were saved  while the wicked were destroyed.    The whole history of the dealings  of the Lord with man has shown the  benefits and blessings of obeying the  Lord and keeping His command  ments. The history of the dealings  of the Lord with ancient Israel shows  that He blessed the righteous and  cursed the wicked and brought His  judgments upon them. Whenever  Israel hearkened to the teachings of  Moses and the prophets, they pros-  pered, and their enemies were a prey  unto them. But when they depart-  ed from the Lord and set up altars to  Baal, and committed sin, the Lord  forsook them, as in the case of Judah  and Jerusalem, in the days of Zede-  kiah the King. [##Jeremiah 32:28-36##] He forsook the Lord,  and led the people astray. They  were full of blood and murder and  whoredom and all manner of abomi-  nations, and the Lord warned them  through His Prophets, Isaiah, Jere-  miah and Ezekiel. These Prophets  told the king and the people what  judgements would come upon them,  and the Lord said by Ezekiel unto  the king and the people, "What I  have spoken shall be done." [##Ezekiel 12:28##] Now  all that these Prophets said came to  pass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un-  fulfilled. The Jews put to death the  Savior and the Apostles and rejected  the Lord and the Gospel; and all that  Moses, Jesus, the Apostles and the  Prophets spoke concerning Israel,  Judah and Jerusalem came to pass to  the very letter.    All the Prophets and Apostles who  have written since man was placed  upon the earth have seen our day,  and have prophesied of the events  which were to take place on the earth  in the last dispensation and fullness  of times. They have seen the Church  of God, the Zion of God, and the   Kingdom of God established on the  earth, and the gathering of the peo-  ple from all nations to build them up,  and the judgments of God which  were to rest, in the last days, upon  all nations who should fight against  Mount Zion and the people of God.  Now, I wish to ask the Latter-day  Saints if they can for a moment think  that the Lord will fail in these days  in fulfilling His promises any more  than He has in other dispensations?  No; He will not.    In fulfillment of his sayings through  the mouths of those ancient Apostles  and Prophets, the Lord has set His  hand once more, for the last time, to  prune His vineyard and to establish  His Church and Kingdom upon the  earth, to be thrown down no more  forever. He has raised up His Pro-  phets and Apostles and revealed unto  them the fulness of the everlasting  Gospel, and given unto them the  everlasting priesthoods of Aaron and  of Melchisedek. Joseph Smith was  raised up by the power of God, and  the administration of angels, and he  brought forth the Book of Mormon,  the record and stick of Joseph in the  hands of Ephraim, as spoken of by  the Prophet Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 37:16-19|37th chap-  ter##. This Prophet of God, Joseph  Smith, had power to organize the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, according to the ancient or-  der of the Church of Christ, with  Apostles and Prophets, Evangelists,  Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. And  the Church has been led continually  by living oracles and the revelations  of God from Heaven until the present  day. It has now stood fifty-six years  since its organization, and its history  is before the heavens and the earth.  The Prophets and Apostles and many  Elders have gone forth and preached  the Gospel of Jesus Christ to many  nations, and tens of thousands of the  inhabitants of the earth have em-  braced the Gospel, been baptized for  the remission of their sins, have re-  ceived the Holy Ghost by the laying  on of hands, and have been gathered  home to Zion from many nations, in  fulfillment of the ancient Prophets,  who spoke as they were moved upon  by the Holy Ghost. Earth and hell  have been combined to stop the little  stone from rolling, and from becom-  ing a mountain and filling the whole  earth, as Daniel said it should in the   last days. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Joseph Smith, his brother  Hyrum, with several of the Apostles  and Elders and many Saints, have  already sealed their testimony with  thir blood, and to-day prisons are  crowded with the Elders of Israel for  keeping the commandments of God,  and many others have been driven  into exile for the same cause.    Many of the inhabitants of the land  are stirred up and are desirous to de-  stroy the Church and Kingdom of  God from off the earth. But they  know not the thoughts of the Lord,  neither understand they His ways.  The Gentile or Christian world to-day  can no more commit sins, and be  guilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy,  whoredoms, or murder, or commit  any abominations, and escape the  wrath of God, then could Sodom and  Gomorrah, or the antediluvian world,  or ancient Israel. The word of the  Lord has been proclaimed against the  Gentiles and all the inhabitants of   the earth in the last days who com-  mit sin, and it will as assuredly be  fulfilled as in ancient days. The Lord  has a controversy with this genera-  tion, and He will judge the inhabi-  tants according to the deeds done in  the body, and none can stay His   hand.    I want to say to the Saints of God  who dwell in the flesh to-day, that  the 56 years which have passed away  since the organization of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  have taken into the spirit world all  our Prophets, Apostles, Elders and  Saints who have finished their testi-  mony in the flesh. Their voice is  hushed in death and their testimony  is closed. They are mingling with  the spirits of the righteous and wait-  ing for the great day of the coming  of the Son of Man, when Jesus Christ  will come in the clouds of heaven to  reward every man according to the  deeds done in the body. But though  they have passed away, is the work  of God finished on the earth? Verily  no. Has the warning voice ceased  to be heard by the inhabitants of the  earth? It has not. All of us who  remain in the flesh are under as much  obligation to lift the warning voice  and reap while the day lasts as  were those who have passed away.    The Lord said to Ezekiel, "I have  made thee a watchman unto the  House of Israel." "When I say unto  the wicked, Thou shalt surely die;  and thou givest him not warning, nor  speakest to warn the wicked from his  wicked way, to save his life; the same  wicked man shall die in his iniquity;  but his blood will I require at thine  hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked,  and he turn not from his wickedness,  nor from his wicked way, he shall  die in his iniquity; but thou hast de-  livered thy soul." [##Ezekiel 3:17-19##] This is precisely  our condition to-day. As Apostles,  Seventies, High Priests, and Elders,  we and all men who bear any portion  of the Holy Priesthood, are watch-  men upon the walls of Zion and mes-  sengers to all the inhabitants of the   earth, and all of us will be held re-  sponsible if we do not improve our time  and lift the warning voice, as far as  we have opportunity, and warn this  generation of the judgments of God  which await them.    I know the judgments of God are  very nigh unto the door of this na-  tion and this generation, and they  will overtake the world before it is  prepared for that time. Even the  coming of the Son of Man is nigh,  and he will come as a thief in the  night. [##2 Peter 3:10##] Who is prepared to abide  the day of His coming? It is our  duty to labor and reap. Then every  man should be diligent in that sphere  in which he is called to act, that his  garments may be clean from the  blood of all men.    I do not believe there was ever a  generation of men who inhabited the  earth who were more wicked, or who  were practising greater abominations,  or who were sinning against greater  light and knowledge, or who had a  greater flood of judgments proclaimed  against them by the word of the Lord,  than the generation in which we live.  Therefore, as Saints of the living God,  who bear the Holy Priesthood, we  shall be under condemnation if we do  not lift up the warning voice against  the evils and abominations which ex-  ist, so far as we have opportunity.  How many woes the Prophets and  Apostles have proclaimed against  those who fight against Zion. "Woe  unto all those who discomfort my  people, and drive and murder them,  and testify against them, saith the  Lord of hosts. A generation of vipers  shall not escape the damnation of  hell. Behold, mine eyes see and  know all their works, and I have in  reserve a swift judgment, in the sea-  son thereof, for them all. For there  is a time appointed for every man,  according at his work shall be." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:23-25##]    I will say to the Apostles, our re-  sponsibility is very great. The  Prophets who organized the Church  and laid the foundation of this last  dispensation, with a whole quorum  of Apostles, have finished their testi-  mony had gone into the spirit world.  We have been called to take their  places. What manner of men ought  we to be? The whole earth is ripen-  ing in iniquity, and the Zion of God  should be prepared for the coming of  the bridegroom. We should humble  ourselves before the Lord and be in a  position to be filled with the spirit of  our calling with the Holy Ghost, and  with the revelations of Jesus Christ,  that we may know the mind and will  of God concerning us, and be pre-  pared to magnify our calling and  bring to pass righteousness, and be  valiant in the testimony of Jesus  Christ to the end of our pilgrimage,  here in the flesh. The Prophets,  Apostles, and all the heavenly hosts  are watching over us. There never  was a time when the work of God re-  quired a more faithful testimony and  labor from the Apostles and Elders  than to-day.    I would say to the Saints, who  stand connected with the quorum of  the Twelve Apostles, as messengers  to the nations of the earth, it has  fal,en to your lot to go forth and  assist to prune the vineyard once  more, and for the last time, before  the coming of the Son of Man. The  Lord said, fifty seven years ago, that  the field was white for the harvest,  and He had set His hand to prune  the vineyard once more, and for the  last time. The Elders were com-  manded at that day to thrust in their  sickle and reap while it was called  to-day, for soon night would come,  when no man could reap. [##Doctrine and Covenants 11:3##] Brethren,  it is much nearer night now than it  was fifty-seven years ago. The  Savior said at that day, that the  angels were crying day and night for  the privilege to go forth and reap  down the earth. He informed them  they must wait a little season until  the harvest was fully ripe. The na-  tions must be warned, Zion must be  established, and the wheat, or the  Saints, be gathered into the garner,  then the angels might go forth and  reap the tares, gather them in bun-  bles and prepare them for the burn-  ing. [##Doctrine and Covenants 86:5-7##]    Since that day many thousands of   the Saints have been gathered to   Zion from the nations of the earth.  But you are called upon at this late  day to still go forth and warn the  Gentiles with the proclamation of  the Gospel. Therefore, brethren,  you who are called to go into the  vineyard, whether Apostles, High  Priests, Seventies, or Elders, do not  be weary in well doing. Remember,  you are messengers of salvation.  Keep yourselves pure and spotless  before God and all men. Seek to  bring to pass righteousness, and save  the souls of men. Labor faithfully  that your garments may be clean  from the blood of all men, and that  the nations may be left without ex-  cuse in the day of God's judgments  upon the wicked, which is nigh at  hand, and those judgments will be  poured out without measure.    All the messengers in the vineyard  should be righteous and holy men,  and call upon the Lord in mighty  prayer, in order to prevail. It is the  privilege of every Elder in Israel,  who is laboring in the vineyard, if  he will live up to his privileges, to  have dreams, visions, and revelations,  and the Holy Ghost as a constant  companion, that he may be able thor-  oughly to gather out the blood of  Israel and the meek of the earth and  bring them into the fold of Christ.    It is true that the Elders who are  called to bear record of the Gospel of  Christ to the nations of the earth are  many times called to pass through  persecutions for the Gospel's sake,  and in some instances to lay down  their lives, as did the ancient Saints,  and quite a number in our day, for   Christ's sake. But there seems to be  a special crown of glory laid up for  every man who is martyed for  Christ's sake and the Gospel's. No  matter in what age of the world he  lays down his life for Christ's, he will  find it again, and eternal life in the  world to come. Therefore, brethren,  let us be diligent in our labors in this   last hour in the vineyard. The Lord  said to Oliver Cowdery, if he labored  all the days of his life and saved but  one soul, how great would be his joy  in the Kingdom of Heaven with that  one soul. [##Doctrine and Covenants 18:15-16##] We have everything to en-  courage us in our labors in the vine-  yard of the Lord.    While this labor is going on among  the nations of the earth, there is a  great labor and responsibility resting  upon the whole ministry who dwell  in Zion. There is labor sufficient for  every man who bears any portion of  the Holy Priesthood in the various  capacities in which the brethren are  called to act. The High Priests,   whose calling is to preside, are called  upon to officiate in Zion as High   Councilors, Presidents of Stakes and  Counselors, Bishops and Counselors,  Superintendents of Sabbath Schools  and mutual improvement associa-  tions. In every capacity in which  they are called to act, they have an  immense field  in which to improve  their talents and magnify their call-  ings. Here is where the High Priests  are mainly called to preside, officiate  and labor.    There never was a time when the  Holy Priesthood, in all its various  branches, offices and labors, had a  greater work to perform than in our  day. The searching out of iniquity,  the purifying, sanctifying and cleans-  ing of the people, the uniting of the  Saints and the general perfecting of  Zion resting upon the brethren and  the Holy Priesthood who dwell in  Zion.    The whole Church, both priest and  people, should give diligent heed to  the late Epistle of the First Presiden-  cy, which has been published to the   world. The counsel they have given  upon the various items they have re-  ferred to should be strictly carried  out. The breaking of the Sabbath  day and pleasure excursions upon  that day should not be indulged in  by the Latter-day Saints. The Pres-  idents of Stakes and their counselors,  the Bishops and their counselors,  whose immediate duty it is to watch  over the stakes and wards, have a  great responsibility and duty to per-  form. Iniquity must be sought out.  Zion cannot prosper when sin and in-  quity are permitted to dwell in her  midst.    One of the most important and re-  sponsible fields of labor in Zion is  that committed to the care of those  who preside over and teach in the  primaries, Sabbath schools, and im-  provement associations, and those  who are teaching private day schools  among the Latter-day Saints. Who  can comprehend the result of the la-  bor performed by the Elders of Israel  in these branches? No man, unless  filled with the revelations of Heaven  and the inspiration of Almighty God.  We send out hundreds of Elders, who  go to the nations of the earth to  preach the Gospel of Christ. After  spending two or three years as mis-  sionaries, if they have converted a  dozen souls and brought them into  the Church, they think they have  done a good work, which they cer-  tainly have. But here, the Elders  who are presiding over the teaching  in these institutions in Zion, filled  with the children of the Saints, have  an army of immortal souls before  them to guide and teach, and to di-  rect their minds, that they may  be qualified to step forth and take  hold of the Church and kingdom of   God and build it up and bear it off  triumphantly, after their fathers and  elders are laid in the tomb. O what a  mission is given to the sons of Eph-  raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter-  day Saints! To warn the whole world  of the judgments which are to come,  preach the Gospel to all people, gath-  er the saints from all nations, build  up Zion, and prepare for the coming  of the Son of Man, standing in holy  places, while judgments waste the   wicked.    There is one admonition of our  Savior that all the Saints of God  should observe, but which, I fear, we  do not as we should, and that is, to  pray always and faint not. I fear, as  a people, we do not pray enough, in  faith. We should call upon the Lord  in mighty prayer, and make all our  wants known unto Him. For if He  does not protect and deliver us and  save us, no other power will. There-  fore our trust is entirely in Him.  Therefore our prayers should ascend   into the ears of our heavenly Father  day and night.    I want to say a few words to our  brethren who are in prison, or under  bonds, or driven into exile for our  religion, or for keeping the command-  ments of God. You should not think  that any strange thing has happened  unto you. Persecution is a legacy  that has been handed down from  father Adam to our day. It was said  of old that all men who lived godly  in Christ Jesus should suffer perse-  cution. If we meet with no persecu-  tion in our day, we shall hardly feel  at home when we go into the spirit   world and meet with the ancient   prophets and with Christ and the  Apostles, who passed through much  persecution and tribulation. Many  of them were crucified or otherwise  put to death. They sealed their tes-  timony with their own blood, as was  the case with Joseph and Hyrum and  several of the Apostles, Elders, and  Saints in our day.    As Elders of Israel, while we are  passing through these afflictions, let  us not cherish revenge or hatred in  our hearts towards our persecutors.  "Vengeance is mine; I will repay,  saith the Lord." [##Romans 12:19##] Jesus Christ, the  Son of God, when nailed to the cross,  and while in the agony of death,  cried, "Father, forgive them; for they  know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Why did  He say this to His Father in Heaven?  Because the Son of God knew full  well what would be the result of His   death upen the heads of His mur-  derers. He knew what awaited the  whole Jewish nation, when that peo-  ple said, "Let His blood be on us  and on our children." [##Matthew 27:25##] He fully com-  prehended the great suffering that  awaited the Jews and their posterity  for the next eighteen hundred years.  He knew that all that Moses and the  Prophets, as well as what He had  spoken Himself, against the Jewish  nation, would come to pass; for God  had spoken it through them, and  his words never fail.    No infidel on earth can deny the  fact that Jerusalem was overthrown,  the foundation of the Temple dug up  and not one stone left upon another.  The Jews fell by famine, by pestilence  and by the sword, until twelve hun-  dred thousand dead bodies were car-  ried through the gates outside of the  walls of Jerusalem during the dis-  tress of the siege under Titus, and a  remnant was taken captive and scat-  tered throughout the world among  the Gentile nations, and the Jews  have been a hiss and a byword, and  have been trampled under the feet  of the Gentiles until the present day,  and the end is not yet, the yoke is  not yet broken from off their necks.    All this has come to pass in fulfil-  ment of the Word of God to the  Jewish nation. So I say to all my  brethren who are in exile, or in  prison, for the Gospel's sake, or for  keeping the commandments of God,  do not harbor any vengeance or ha-  tred against this nation, or against  those who have aided or abetted in  your sufferings, but rather go before  the Lord and pray that He will sof-  ten the hearts of the rulers of the na-  tion, that they will give unto the  Latter day Saints the same rights and  privileges in the worshiping of God  according to the dictates of their own  consciences as are guaranteed by the  Constitution of our Government,  which was given by the inspiration  of the God of heaven for a wise pur-  pose in Himself.    If I am asked why I make this re-  quest of my brethren, I answer, for  the same reason that Jesus said,  "Father, forgive them; for the know  not what they do." For as the God  of heaven fulfilled all His words  which He spoke concerning Judea  and Jerusalem, so will He fulfill all  that He has spoken concerning the  Gentiles and all the nations of the  earth in the last days.    I will here say, as truly as the God  of heaven lives, and has established  His throne on high, just so truly will  He bring to pass the fulfilment of  His words. He will pour out that  flood of judgments upon our nation  and upon all the nations of the earth,  which has been proclaimed by every  inspired man since the world began.  The seals will be opened, the plagues  poured out, and Great Babylon will  fall. This generation has been warn-  ed for the last fifty years by inspired  and righteous men, and after their  testimony will come the testimony of  thundering, of lightning, of floods,  of earthquakes, and of pestilence,  and famine, and war, and the flames  of devouring fire, for by fire and by  sword will the Lord plead with all  flesh and the slain of the Lord will  be many. For the Lord has said,  "My sword is bathed in heaven, and  it shall fall upon Idumea, or the  world: and who is able to stand?" [##Isaiah 34:5##]    No power on earth can stay the  hand of God in this work. The God  of heaven will teach this nation and  all other nations on earth, that He is  stronger than man. He pays no re-  gard to nations or numbers, in the  fulfillment of his purposes, for He  holds in His hand the destiny of all  men and nations, and no power be-  neath the heavens can hinder His  work. The God of Israel has set his  hand to gather His people from all  nations and build up His Church and  establish Zion in all that beauty,  power, and glory which Isaiah and  other Prophets saw, and to build up  His kingdom, which shall fill the  whole earth, and in which Jesus of  Nazareth will establish his throne  and sit thereon, and reign over the  earth for one thousand years, as the  Prophet Daniel and other Prophets  have declared. And it will come to  pass in spite of earth and hell and all  the unbelief of the whole Christian  Gentile world. If our nation or the  Gentiles do not believe this, let them  wait and see, and they will not have  to wait long before they will see the  signs manifest of the beginning of  these things. So far as the Saints are  concerned, the Spirit of God will bear  record to their spirits as they read  these testimonies, of their truth.    I will close by quoting the testi-  mony of Ezekiel in the ##Ezekiel 24:14|24th chapter  14th verse##—"I the Lord have spoken  it; it shall come to pass, and I will do  it; 1 [I] will not go back, neither will I   repent; according to thy ways, and  according to thy doings, shall they  judge thee, saith the Lord God."    WILFORD WOODRUFF.    October, 26, 1886. 
 MANTI TEMPLE.    An Address from President Woodruff in  Relation Thereto.    SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20th, 1887.    To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops and  the Saints generally:    It is with profound feelings of grati-  tude and thanksgiving to our heavenly  Father that we announce to the  Latter-day Saints that the Temple  which is being erected at Manti has  been so nearly completed as to be  ready for the upholstering, furniture,  carpets etc., which are necessary to  put it in a state of complete prepara-  tion for the sacred labors to be per-  formed therein. This is the third  building of this character which in the   kind providence of God the Latter-day  Saints have been permitted to erect  and finished in these mountains. The   Temple at Salt Lake City is also pro-  gressing in a satisfactory manner,  which, when finished, will be the  fourth Temple that has been construct-  ed by the Saints under the direction  of the Almighty since we came to  these valleys.    How blessed are the people who  have had these glorious privileges  granted unto them! Our hearts swell  with irrepressible feelings of thanks-  giving and joy to our Father in heaven  that he has permitted His Saints to  build these houses. They now have  opportunities to act as saviors of their  fellow men, which but few genera-  tions of the children of men have ever  enjoyed. The great work of the res-  toration of the dead which will occu-  py the time and thought of future  generations has now begun, never  more to end until the earth is sancti-  fied and the plan of salvation devised  in the eternal worlds for human re-  demption is fully consummated.    Our object in addressing you in this  circular is to present to all the mem-  bers of the Church the opportunity of  contributing, according to their means  and liberality, something towards the  furnishing of the Manti Temple. Here-  tofore the contributions for that build-  ing have been confined to the Stakes  which are numbered in what is known  as the "Manti Temple District." Be-  fore the Logan Temple was completed  an opporutnity was given to the   Saints to contribute towards the pur-  chasing of its furnishings, furniture,  etc. They gladly responded to the  call which was made upon them. We  feel that they will, on the present oc-  casion, appreciate the privilege of  contributing in like manner towards  the purchasing of suitable upholstery,  carpeting, etc., for the Manti Temple.  The funds of the Superintendent are  exhausted, and contracts are already  made for needed articles, which have  to be met at an early date.    Contributions will be taken from  twenty-five cents upwards, so that  those who are the most limited in  means need not be debarred, while  those who are more wealthy, can have  the satisfaction and pleasure of mak-  ing donations according to their  ability for the completion of this  noble edifice. We would like the  Presidents and Bishops to give every  one an opportunity of doing some-  thing in this direction, and the names   of all, with the amounts contributed,  should be carefully taken.    We would like to see the names of  every man, woman and child in the   Church recorded in the Archives of  the Temple as having contributed  something towards its erection and  completion.    These funds with the donors' names  can either be forwarded to the office  of the Presiding Bishop or to the Chief  Clerk—Brother James Jack, at the  President's Office.    It is important that these collec-  tions should be made and remitted as  promptly as possible, as the need for  this means is pressing.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,    In behalf of the Council of the Apos-  tles. 
 TRUE RELIGION    Consists in the Love of God, Faith  in His Son, Repentance and  Forsaking of Sin, Obedi-  ence of the Ordinances,  and Keeping of  the Law.    As Set Forth Forcibly by President  Wilford Woodruff,    In Fatherly Admonition to the Lat-  ter day Saints.    EDITOR HERALD: Receiving a  letter from you, some time since,   wherein you solicit for publication  "an array of sentiments from the  leading men of the Territory," etc  I now at the last moment, after  having been so busy, undertake,  with leasure, to comply with your  request.    RELIGIOUS.    The majority of the people of   this Territory are a religious people  By revelation and inspiration from  Almighty God the Latter day  Saints are called upon to perpetuate  and establish righteous principles,   not only in the Territory, but  throughout the earth. The Dis  pensation of the Fulness of Times  is ushering in upon the inhabitants  of the earth, and with it are re-  ceived the principles of Eternal   Life, the greatest gift of God to  man. The Latter day Saints who  constitute the largest proportion of  the people who inhabit these Rocky   Mountain vales have revealed to  them this gift through Jesus, the  Mediator—the Savior of the world.    Therefore, Oh! ye Latter day  Saints, Oh! ye House of Israel, and  Oh! ye inhabitants of the earth, re-  member! that when God, the   Father, gave His only begotten son  as a ransom for your sins, He gave   a Christmas gift that cannot be ex-  celled---the gift of eternal life!  Through this gift ye can possess the  riches of Eternity.    Should there not be something  given in return as an acknowledg-  ment for this gift? It cannot be  bought with money, so far as the   riches of this world is concerned it  is without price. But the price  of it is, the love of God the Father,  faith in His Son Jesus, repentance  and the forsaking of sin, obedience  to the sacred ordinance of baptism,   and the laying on of hands for the  reception of the Holy Ghost, and  then the keeping of all His holy   and revealed laws.    This is true religion. These are   some of the religious principles  adopted by the Latter-day Saints,  and how to obtain the gift of eter-  nal life should be the highest am-  bition of every man, woman, and   child. The earth groans under a  false Christianity. The true Chris-  tian principles that were advocated  by the Savior and His Apostles are  no longer practised throughout  modern "Christendom." The earth  is deluged with false Gospel, false  religion, and with different systems  and plans of salvation. The inhab-  tants of the earth are being "tossed  to and fro by every wind of doc-  trine." [##Ephesians 4:14##] False teachers "having a  form of godliness but denying the  power thereof" have sprung up in  every land and clime; parties, sects,  and organizations under religious  garbs are extending their multita-  rious false theories, enveloping the  mind of man with a hopeless faith. [##2 Timothy 3:5##]   The signs of the times portend the  fulfillment of the prophecies that  have been made concerning the  great wickedness that should be  upon the earth in the latter days,  when great plagues shall be  poured out upon the world and  Angels pour out the vials of the   wrath of Almighty God. But pre-  vious to this all people are to be  warned by the proclamation of the   Gospel of Jesus Christ, committed  through the Angel that John the  Revelator saw "flying through the  midst of Heaven, having the ever-  lasting Gospel to preach to every   nation, kindred, tongue, and peo-  ple, saying with a loud voice, 'Fear  God, and give glory to Him, for  the hour of His judgment is come.' " [##Revelation 14:6-7##]    That Angel has flown, the Gospel  proclamation has been sent forth to  the world for the last half century  and over, and we may expect the  judgments to follow these declara-  tions, for it is decreed "the hour of  His judgment is come."    The Latter-day Saints have gath-  ered to these mountain vales, by   the revelations of God, to prepare  a place of refuge, for the gathering  in of Israel, that the honest in heart  from all nations might have a place  of safety and escape the judgments   of the wicked. And while the wick-  ed rule and the people mourn, the  Saints of the Most High will con-  tinue to establish the principles of  righteousness, the principles of free-  dom and true government, until the  Lord Himself comes to reign as   "King of Kings and Lord of Lords."    SOCIAL.    The social condition of the Lat-  ter day Saints is founded upon   their unity. "In unity there is  strength." "United we stand,  divided we fall," is our true maxim:  And as Paul, the Apostle of old,  said to the Former-day Saints, so  say I to the Latter-day Saints.  "Be ye not unequally yoked to-  gether with unbelievers; for what  fellowship hath righteousness with  unrighteousness? and what com  munion hath light with darkness?  And what concord hath Christ with  Belial? or what part hath he that  believeth with an infidel?" (##2 Corinthians 6:14-15|2 Cor  VI., 14, 15, 16##)    These questions of Paul's are rel  evant and very important to the  social status of the Latter-day Saints,  for, as Paul further says: "What  agreement hath the Temple of God  with idols? for ye are the Temple  of the Living God; as God hath  said: 'I will dwell in them, and  walk in them; and I will be their  God, and they shall be My people.   Wherefore come out from among,   and be ye separate; saith the  Lord, and touch not the unclean   thing, and I will receive you; and   will be a Father unto you, and ye  shall be my sons and daughters,  saith the Lord Almighty.' " (##2 Corinthians 6:16-18|2 Cor.  VI; 16, 17, 18)    As a people, we cannot affiliate  with the world, nor the things of  the world, and keep ourselves pure  and unspotted from the world.   The Savior says "If ye were of the  world, the world would love his  own, but because ye are not of the  world, but I have chosen you out  of the world, therefore the world  hateth you." (##John 15:19|S. John, XV, 19.##)    The Latter-day Saints are  "chosen out of the world" and ga-  thered here into the tops of the  mountains for the purpose of build-  ing up the Church of Christ, that  in this Church they might be   taught more fully the ways of the   Lord and learn to walk in His  paths, that they may be prepared  to establish the Kingdom of God  spoken of by Daniel, the Prophet,  that he saw should be set up in the  latter days by the God of Heaven,  and which shall never be destroyed  or left to other people, but shall  stand forever. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]    Now, the Latter-day Saints, un-  derstanding their calling, cannot   afford to mingle, in their associa-  tions, with the world; for in the   very nature of things the two ele-  ments will not unite and still re-  main in a healthy and prosperous   condition. "Love not the world,  neither the things of the world; if  any man loves the world the love   of the Father is not in him," so  say the Scriptures; and those who  are not for the Kingdom are  against it. [##1 John 2:15##] Therefore, as the chosen   people of God, we ought to honor  our Father who has chosen us, and  be very careful whom we associate   with. In all our dealings and as-  sociations let them be with the  Latter-day Saints. Be watchful of  the sons and daughters of Zion that  they do not become "unequally  yoked together with unbelievers." [##2 Corinthians 6:14##]  Let the sons of Zion take the  daughters of Zion to wife. Let  the people of God be united in all  things, politically, religiously,  socially, commercially, and  industrially. "If ye are not  one ye are not mine" says the Sa-  vior; and also, He says: "Be ye one  as the Father and I are one." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] [##John 17:21-22##]    If the Latter-day Saints will  adhere and give heed to these wise  sayings, the Lord, in His own due  time,—in the time of the harvest,  shall send forth His reapers, the  Angels, who shall gather out the  tares to be burned; and "The Son  of Man shall send forth His angels,  and they shall gather out of His  Kingdom all things that offend, and  them which do iniquity; and shall  cast them into a furnace of fire;  there shall be wailing and gnashing   of teeth. Then shall the righteous  shine forth as the sun in the King-  dom of their Father," (##Matthew 13:41-43|St. Matthew,  xiii; 41, 42, 43.##)    Wishing your patrons a "Merry  Christmas!" and a "Happy New  Year!"

 FROM PRES. WOODRUFF.    An Epistle to the Saints Throughout the  World.    Beloved Brethren and Sisters: Once   more in the dispensation of Provi-  dence we are called to mourn the de-  parture from this life of a friend and   brother.    The Prophet, Seer, Revelator and   President of the Church, Elder John   Taylor, was called to rest on the   evening of July 25th, 1887. In sor-  row for our loss, we, your brethren,  join with you in mourning his depar-  ture. Having fought the good fight,  he earned a crown of endless glory,  and now mingles with Joseph and  Hyrum and Brigham.    He has gone beyond the vail, but  God is with us still to comfort, inspire   and direct us heretofore. Peace be un-  to you. As upon two former occasions  in our history, the duty and responsi-  bility of presiding over and directing  the affairs of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints in all the  world devolves upon the Twelve Apos-  tles. With the blessing of the Lord   and the faith and prayers of His peo-  ple, we hope to do our duty until we,  too, shall be laid to rest.    As Saints of the Most High, while  living, let us give our hearts to God,   sanctify ourselves by keeping his  commandments, have oil in our lamps,   our houses in order, and hopefully  and prayerfully look forward to the   day of deliverance, the set time for   the accomplishment of which is fast  approaching.    While mourning for the dead and  holding his memory sacred, let us   trust in the God of Heaven, remember   the living, unite our hearts, and earn-  estly strive for the redemption of   Zion.    Let us not seek occasion for offense  one against another, but forgive each  other's trespasses; that the Holy   Ghost may be our constant compan-  ion, and the doctrines of the priest-  hood distil on our minds like the dews  of heaven.    "Many are called, few are chosen."   The Almighty has revealed in our day  the reasons, but what a mighty boat   have wrecked their eternal hopes on   these fatal reefs—love of the riches of  this world, the honors and praises of  men, and the exercise of unrighteous   dominion. 
 Elder W Woodruff quoted from the revelations that  the Lord is angry with the wicked every day. Many  things are being done here which are pleasing to the  Lord. The building of the Temples may be an advantage  pernniarily; but there are other and far greater  considerations. The Lord will not disappoint anyone  in regard to his revelations, their unbelief to the  contrary, notwithstanding. As God lives the United  States will follow in the wake of the Jaredites.  The labor of the Elders of Israel today is in building  Temples, administering therein for the living and the dead;  when the ordinances are performed for them they are saved  so far, the Heavens are watching no we should be  diligent. Man, who is destined to live as long as  God lives, says, give me money, you may take the  blessing of eternal lives. What a strange inconsistency.  No man can be exalted to the godhead but by the laws  of Celestial Marriage. Zion will rise, Babylon fall  could we see beyond the veil we would go to and build  these temples and be anxious to redeem our dead. 
 PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF    bore testimony to what had been  said, to-day, and endorsed the ex-  cellent principles of the Priesthood  and revelations, advanced by the  Presidency in the morning. We  shouls exercise faith in the Lord.  As to the schemes of the ungodly we  shouldnot be concerned; for this is  the work of God and He will sus-  tain us. All the keys and powers  of Priesthood were sealed upon the  Prophet Joseph and he sealed them  upon others. These powers will re-  main here until the Lord Jesus  comes. Every Saint holds a por-  tion of the Priesthood. Let the  people of God, therefore, rejoice for  the glorious powers of the Priest-  hood. We are built on the rock  Jesus and the machinations of the  adversaries cannot prevail against  it. 
 Let all Israel remember that the  eternal and everlasting priesthood is  bestowed upon us for the purpose  alone of administering in the ordin-  ances of life and salvation, both for  the living and the dead, and no man  on earth can use the priesthood for   any other purpose than the work of   the ministry, the perfecting of the   Saints, edifying the body of Christ,   establishing the kingdom of heaven,  and redeeming Zion. If we attempt   to use it for unrighteous purposes,  like lightning from heaven our power,   sooner or later, falls, and we fail  to accomplish the design of God.    Let us, therefore, beloved brethren  and sisters, beware of the pride of the  world, and, casting vanity far from  us, be true to God, true to each   other and end true to the coven-  ants that we have made. Purg-  ing ourselves from iniquity and the  workers thereof, let us set our  faces like flint against sin and wicked-  ness of every kind. So shall we, while   patiently following the Redeemer,   eventually gain the victory over flesh,   hell and the grave. We will continue  in communication with you as circum-  stances may require and opportunities   be afforded.    Praying the Lord God of heaven  and earth, who holds all men and  things in the grasp of His power, to  comfort, cheer and bless you, we re-  main    Your brethren in the Gospel cove-  nant,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,    In behalf of the Twelve Apostles.  August, 1887. 
 PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF    was pleased to be present on this  occasion. What has been done in  building this house, shows what can  be done by union. The house is  large enough to hold you all, but it  will probably not always be so.  Notwithstanding the laws passed,  against us, we know that their laws   do not extend to the spirit world to  prevent the labors there. The Lord  has set to work to gather His Israel  and prepare them to build, His  Zion, a place where His Saints can   be preserved while the judgements  of the Lord are scourging the world.  To look at the efforts of the world,  their labors look great to us, but to  the Lord they are but puny noth-  ings. God never gave up His ef-  forts to please the enemies of His  people. We are His people, fulfilling  His prophecy given by Isaiah  wherein he sees out travels over the  plains, and our building cities and   towns in the mountains. There is  no power that can overthrow this  people, God has guided their des-  tiny and will ever do so until the  Saints have done their labors.    There are no fears except with  ourselves. We must be united; di-  vision is dangerous. In all things  we must be united. God bless us  all and remember those who have  aided in building this house. Fields  will prosper more and homes become  brighter when we obey God and  live up to the requirements made of   us. This earth is made for us, but  it is God's with all we possess. We  can lose nothing by building houses  for ourselves, by paying tithing, and  by giving offerings unto the Lord.  We are His with all we possess.  This is our testimony, after the tes-  timonies of the servants of God will  follow destruction and thunders, ac-  cording to the decrees of God. May  God bless us and aid us to appreci-  ate the positions and blessings that  we enjoy. 
 Great Salt Lake City  Nov 7, 1860    Brother Amasa Lyman    Dear sir,    I feel like writing you a few lines, altho' I have no  special news to communicate. There has been a good deal of sickness in  October, and many deaths among children, one of brother C. C. Richs children   has died since he left. My daughter, Phebe, wife of Lorenzo Snow lost an infant,   it only lived two days, and as two of your women were sick, and had   young children, Phebe took Caroline's child to nurse, it was very feeble  when she took it, it is now a very healthy child and growing finely,   she has spent a good deal of time of late at your house to assist them    You are probably aware of the course President Young   has taken in regard to the Missionaries who are abroad, and those   going abroad, that they are forbidden to collect means of the Saints to   send home to their families, and also not to bring any thing home  themselves, only the Souls and Bodies of the poor Saints; and to obviate  this, a collection was taken up in this City to send the Missionaries to  their field of labor, and to keep their families. of I think some 12,00000 were  subscribed, and on the strength of this, I went to your family in the City  and got a list of what articles they said they wanted, and they have been  furnished since with the articles they called for, except the calking and  plastering of their house: I have not yet been able to get that done, but  have the promise of it.    We have had some of the loudest preaching of late from Pres.t Young 
 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFF    first addressed the meeting. He said  we have been called on, to-day, to   mourn the death of one of God's   noble men; on the earth, Presiding   Bishop Edward Hunter was one.   He had, in the early times of this   Church, been closely associated with   the Prophet Joseph Smith, and in  one sense was, at one time, the Pro-  phet's right-hand man. The speaker   did not feel to mourn, personally,   for the deceased; for he believed he  was happier than any in that con-  gregation, and that he is now ming-   ling with Joseph Smith, Brigham   Young, H. C. Kimball, George A.   Smith, and scores of others, with   whom he associated here in the   flesh. His record, which is good,   is now before God, angels, and men,   and the speaker did not feel that it   was necessary for him to say much   on that subject.    President Woodruff then spoke   of the blessings and glories that   await all those who keep their   covenants and remain faithful, in   their positions of trust as Bishop   Hunter has done. Such the Lord   will sustain and bless in the future   as He has done in the past. He   felt admonished by the departure of   Brother Hunter, and he admon-  ished all others to be men and wo-   men of integrity and fidelity, so   that when our demise occurs our   death may be like his. He closed   by bearing testimony that the de-  ceased had always been faithful   and true while he lived in the   Church upon the earth. He prayed   God to bless the family of Brother   Hunter, that they may emulate the   vitrues of their husband and father,   and have the privilege of again   meeting and associating with him   in the Kingdom of God. 
 Cambridgeport Mass  March 28th 1850    Brother Amasa Lyman    Dear Sir    I Received your   kind Letter of  Jan 12th by the Hand of  Brother Badlam &  was truly glad to hear from you. I must tell you  in the Beginning that I cannot comply with your request  by writing you a long letter for I cannot steal time enough to  do it for I have been overwhelmed in business since Badlams  Return But I will write a Litterle & begin by saying that John Taylor  Erastus Snow Lorenzo Snow & F D Richards of the Twelve with about 20  Elders arived safe to the Starts States on their missions F.

 NOTICE.    W.  WOODRUFF would inform his  friends that he has removed his stock  of goods to the south-west corner of the pub-  lic square, in the 16th ward, in the house  formerly occupied by John Ralston. He  would still invite his friends and customers  to continue to call and trade with him. He  also returns his thanks for the liberal patron-  age they have shown him,    He also wishes all persons who were to  pay their bills by the first of March to step in  and do the same without any further call.

 concerning Jew and Gentile that we have ever heard. He seems  particularly inspired to take a decided stand concerning our  enemies, and to point out the destiny of the wicked as well as the   righteous: much of the power of God rested upon President Young  during Conference. I would judge from the operation of the Spirit  of the Lord, that there is some important event nigh, which will  greatly effect both Zion and Babylon: many of the Gentiles have  attended our meetings of late, including the Government officials,  and they have certainly heard ^had^ some large Pills to swallow, and I think  the sinners in Zion have troubled some of late.    The Presidency, George A Smith and some others have taken a  mission South, and visited the Branches South as far as San Pete,  they have preached in all the settlements and returned this evening,  7th, he has been gone 15 days, and preached 20 discourses.    Report says that four of the Salt Lake rowdies have gone under   at Pike's peak, two were shot and two hung, including the Sprouse boy.  John Martin Luce was stabbed last night in a row, it is thought mortal  I hope so at least; he stabbed a man by the name of Olphin twice   before Olphin stabbed him.    An extra session of the Legislature is called for next Monday  to appoint the Judges their field of labor. Cradlebaugh and Henikin  are now in Carson valley, I expect Judge Crosby will be sent to help   them; Judge Kinney will remain with us.    We have had a fine fall till the last of October, when we had   a cold snow storm, we had near a foot of snow fall, it was quite  cold for several days—many potatoes in the ground, and some sugar 
 November 16, 1888    Dear Brother Addy.    Brother R. handed me your note this  morning. In reply will say I supposed you under  stood perfectly well the situation of all papers and  documents in the Historian's Office how they were disposed  of there was no time to list or itemize them or anything in  that office when they were removed. It would have taken three  clerks four days to have listed what was removed from that  office, and we expected every hour for the officers to seize  and the work was not done any too soon. Now the facts are  there was 100 pidgeon holes full of papers and they were put  by the bushel into larger boxes with other things without any  listing whatever. There are three tons of those boxes and you know  the house where they were deposited and I have tried to get them  removed before you went away and I have never been able to  do it until within a few days. Brother Jacques is now at work  to try and find the papers you want, but it is like looking for a  needle in a hay mow, but he will do as fast as he can. If there  had been time to have numbered those boxes and named each  item it would have been an easy matter to have got at them, but  there was no time given for it. Brother Jacques has just come in, He  is searching the boxes and has found eight of the papers and given  them to Bro. R. this morning. I do not feel to cast any blame upon  any one but ourselves in this matter. You know that I have been

 ON or before January 1st, 1891,   there will be issued from the   press of the   JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE   a publication which should be   carefully read and studied by all   the Saints, both old and young.   It is written by Dr. J. E. Talmage   and entitled    DOMESTIC SCIENCE.    The following endorsements of   the work speak volumes in its   favor:    SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 1, 1890.    TO ALL CONCERNED:    With the growth of our Church   school system, and of the Mutual Improve-  ment Associations among our people, the   need of text-books specially adapted for   use under those organizations becomes   very apparent.    A short time ago Dr. J. E. Talmage   was requested by us to prepare a work of    medium size and scope on subjects of   practical and scientific interest; and as a   result he has written a small volume   entitled "Domestic Science."    A committee appointed to examine the  book has heartily endorsed it as a worthy   work representing an extended array of   useful facts expressed in simple but forci-  ble style, and imbued throughout with   the spirit of our religion.    We take pleasure in recommending the   little work to our people as well adapted   for use in our Church schools, also in the   Mutual Improvement Associations, and   for general reading.    Your brethren in the gospel,  WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEO. Q. CANNON,  JOS. F. SMITH. 
 FROM MONAY'S DAILY, MAY 14, 1888.    Y.M.M.I.A. CONFERENCE.    A general conference of the Young   Men's Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions will be held in the Tabernacle,   Salt Lake City, on Saturday and Sun-  day June 2nd and 3rd. Meetings will   commence each day at 10 a.m., 2 p.m.   and 8 p.m.    The general and local authorities of   the Church are requested to promote   the interests of this conference, so far   as they are able, that it may be largely   attended and productive of the ut-  most good.    A general invitation to the people is   extended to be present.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  JOSEPH F. SMITH,  MOSES THATCHER,    General Superintendency  Y.M.M.I.A. 
 DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE  AT MANTI.    IT has been decided to dedicate the   Manti Temple on MONDAY, MAY 21,   1888. The dedicatory services will   commence at 10 o'clock a.m.    The Quarterly Conference of the   Sanpete Stake will be held on Satur-  day and Sunday, the 19th and 20th of   May.    It may be necessary to continue   the service of dedication more than   one day. This will depend upon the   number of persons who may be pres-  ent, and who may desire to witness   and take part in the proceedings.   At Logan the number of persons pres-  ent was so great that it required   three days' services to enable all who   desired to be present to get admis-  sion to the Temple.    The facilities for reaching Manti are   not so good as they were for reach-  ing Logan. The Utah Central Rail-  road runs from the north and south to   Nephi. At that point the Sanpete   Valley Railroad connects with it and   reaches into Sanpete as far as Ches-  ter, a distance of about fifteen miles   from Manti. From this point convey-  ance will necessarily be by teams.    While it is desirable that all the offi-  cers and members of the Church who   can possibly be present at the dedica-  tion should be three [there], still it will be   necessary for all who go, to make  their own arrangements for transpor-  tation from Chester to Manti, and also   for their entertainment while there,   either at Manti or some of the adjacent   settlements. The accommodations at   Manti are limited; but on such an oc-  casion as this, no doubt, everything   will be done that is possible by the   residents to make the visitors com-  fortable and to furnish th  the nec-  essary entertainment.    By addressing letters to the   Presidency of the Sanpete Stake  —President Canute Peterson and   his Counselors, Henry Beal and   John B. Maiben—or to Super-  intendent William H. Folsom, of the   Manti Temple, arrangements, doubt-  less, can be made by visitors both for   transportation and accommodation.    Admission to the Dedication services   will be by ticket. These tickets will   be given to the Presidents of Stakes,   and, in their absence, to their Coun-  selors or the Bishops, and by them will   be distributed to the members of their   Stakes and Wards who are in good   standing. It will be well for the  members who desire to go to   Manti on this occassion to ascer-  tain beforehand whether the Presi-  dency of the Stake or the Bishop and  Counselors of the Ward to which they  belong will be at the Dedicaton ser-  vices; for if none of these should be  present, they ought to provide them-  selves, before leaving home, with let-  ters of recommendation, so that they   may be admitted to the Temple with-  out question.    Special rates on the railroads will  be made to all persons going to and   returning from Manti on this occa-  sion.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,    On behalf of the Council of the   Apostles.

I have had no knowledge  that you wanted these things until within a few days and it has been  in the midst of Council Meetings. I did not know until to-day that you  was publishing a book upon [ink faded] all papers will be  turned over to R. as fast as they can be found.    Now concerning what has been published in the News on the  testimony in Idaho, I think it has been unwise to publish so much  of that stuff. If I mistake not you sent word for Williams to look  over that testimony and leave out such as ought not to be pub  lished, and publish the rest and we sent him word to do that,  and it seems he has published the whole of it.    I received a present of the History of Joseph Smith by  your order a few days since, for which please receive my  sincere thanks for the same.

 THE CONTRIBUTOR.  A MONTHLY MAGAZINE.    JUNIUS F. WELLS,  EDITOR AND PUBLISHER.    TERMS:  Two Dollars a Year, In Advance.    SALT LAKE CITY, JULY, 1884.    ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE   ELDERS.    I WOULD rather have a son in the vine-  yard, saving the souls of men, than to   have him heaping up gold at home and  becoming a millionaire. Yes, I thank  God that the young men of Israel are  rising up and going forth into the vine-  yard and magnifying the Holy Priest-  hood, and preparing themselves to fulfil  their high destiny in this important dis-  pensation. As I look over the history  of this Church and kingdom of God on   the earth, and think of the army of faith-  ful laborers in the kingdom who have  passed to the other side of the vail, and  realize that I soon shall follow them, and   as I draw near to the close of my testi-  mony and labor in the flesh, my anxiety  greatly deepens and increases concern-  ing the rising generation which I am to   leave behind me in these mountains of  Israel. I am thoroughly satisfied in my  own mind that there never was a genera-  tion of young men and maidens since   the world was, that had awaiting them  the same high destiny that awaits the   young men and maidens who dwell in  these valleys, surrounded by the ever-  lasting hills, upon whose heads rest the  blessings which the old Patriarch Jacob  sealed upon the heads of his sons,  Joseph and Ephraim, and their posterity.  Through their lineage the sons and  daughters who inhabit these mountains  claim, and, as God lives, will inherit the  blessings sealed upon the head of   Ephraim in the last days.    We are living in a momentous age,  and events as weighty as ever rested  upon the earth will have to be met by  the generation which follows us. The   whole earth is groaning under the  weight of darkness, crime, corruption  and abominations, and its inhabitants  are preparing themselves for the out-  pouring of the just judgments and in-  dignation of an avenging God. In the   midst of this scene of events, where   will either heaven or earth look for a   people, except the sons and daughters  of Zion, to hold the helm of state, or to  prepare a place of safety that mortal  men may stand in holy places and be  preserved, while the great judgments of  God sweep the wicked from off the  earth, in fulfilment of the revelations of  St. John and other Apostles and Prophets  who spoke as they were moved upon by  the Holy Ghost? Though heaven and  earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of  what has been predicted will fall unful-  filled. Neither God nor angels look to  any other people than the Latter-day  Saints—the Elders of Israel, the young  men of Zion, to go forth bearing the  Holy Priesthood to warn this Christian,  Gentile generation with the Gospel of  Jesus Christ of the judgments which are   to come; and their testimony will prove  a savor of life unto life or of death unto  death to all who hear it.    Therefore, ye Elders of Israel, and  young men who are in the vineyard of  the Lord, or who dwell in Zion, prepare   yourselves for that which is to come. Take  upon yourselves the whole armor of  God, and bear a true and faithful testi-  mony unto all people where providence  may call you, that your garments may  be clean from the blood of all men, for  the eyes of all the heavenly hosts of  God, angels and men, are watching over  you with feelings of the deepest inter-  est. You are called and ordained of   God to prepare this great and mighty  work for the coming of the Son of Man.  The Lord has said, through the mouth  of His servant Joseph, that "you are  commanded of God to go to all the  great and notable cities and villages, re-  proving the world in righteousness of all  their unrighteous and ungodly deeds,  setting forth clearly and understandingly  the desolation of abomination in the last 
 The subject to which the Hon. W. H.   Rowe and his associates, as the execu-  tive commission for Utah of the National   Irrigation Congress, which meets at   Denver September 3, 1894, calls your  attention, is one of great importance   to our Territory and people. The   information asked for is needed to have   our Territory and its agricultural inter-  ests appear in their proper light before   the nation, and especially the neighbor-  ing states and territories; and moreover,   that as a State Utah shall become a potent   factor in framing the public irrigation   legislation of the future. We, therefore,   take this method of calling your atten-  tion to these requests, and take the   liberty of emphasizing what the com-  mission have said, that our influence   may be joined to theirs in impressing   you with the importance of giving them   the fullest aid and information, and that,   too, at once.    Very respectfully, your brethren,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 TO THE PUBLIC.    It having been stated that Mr. A. J.   Stewart, of Utah County, has repre-  sented himself, while in the East and   in Mexico, as an agent of the Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,   for the purchase of lands in Mexico,   and for colonizing our people thereon,   I have pleasure in stating to the public   through this notice that Mr. Stewart   wholly disclaims having made, here or   elsewhere, any such claim.    Mr. Stewart's operations in such   matters have nothing whatever to do   with the Church; and the Saints hav-  ing business in Mexico, or who con-  template investing means or making   homes in that country, would do well   to consult with Elder Moses Thatcher   at Logan, Cache County, Utah, or   Elder A. F. Macdonald, at Juarez,   Canton Galeana, Chihuahua, Mexico   or with Bishop Wm. D. Johnson, Jr   at Diaz, Canton Galeana Chihuahua,  Mexico.    WILFORD WOODRUFF.

 days; for with you, saith the Lord Al-  mighty, I will rend their kingdoms: I   will not only shake the earth, but the   starry heavens shall tremble; for I, the   Lord, have put forth my hand to exert  the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it  now, yet a little while and ye shall see  it, and know that I am, and that I will   come and reign with my people. I am  Alpha and Omega, the beginning and  the end. Amen."    Thus, ye Elders of Israel, with the   word of the Lord resting upon you, what  manner of men ought ye to be? Gird  up the loins of your minds—watch and  be sober. Be ye clean that have the   words of the Lord, that ye may be free   from the blood of this generation. If  you labor all the days of your life and  save one soul, how great will be your  joy in the kingdom of God with that  soul! How much more if ye save many  souls!    The Lord has called His servants into  the vineyard to prune it for the last time,  and He is also often showing us, by   revelation, the great events that are at  our doors—the gathering of Israel, the   return of the Ten Tribes, the fall of  Babylon, the judgments of God, the  overthrow of the wicked, and all that is  to transpire in the hour of God's judg-  ment, and the final coming of the Son  of Man in the clouds of heaven to re-  ward every man according to the deeds  done in the body. I say, after the Lord  has set all these things before us, He  says unto us, "If you believe me you  will labor while the day lasts, for soon  night will come when no man can work."  There are great events at the door. This  generation knows not what awaits them.  When the people reject the testimony of  the Elders of Israel and turn them from  their doors, they little know what they  are doing or what their reward will be;  and while our nation is laboring for the  destruction of the Church and kingdom  of God, and trample under their feet the  laws and Constitution which have been  bequeathed unto us by our forefathers  through the inspiration of Almighty  God, they little know of the seed they  sow or the fearful harvest they are   doomed to reap. These eternal truths   rest with weight upon my mind.    The historian says: "The decline and  fall of Rome was attributable to the gen-  eral corruption of the people, and to the  engrossing love of pleasure and idle-  ness. Work, in the last days of Rome,  was regarded as only fit for slaves. Its  citizens ceased to pride themselves on  the virtues and characters of their great  forefathers, and the empire fell because  it did not deserve to live. When nation-  al character ceases to be upheld, a na-  tion may be regarded as next to lost.  When it ceases to esteem and to prac-  tice the virtues of truthfulness, honesty,  integrity and justice, it does not deserve  to live."    The historian, in this respect, has only  drawn the picture of what has followed  all cities, nations and kingdoms of the   whole earth from the creation of the   world until now, and will continue until  the end of the world. The history of  Sodom and Gomorrah, the antediluvian  world, and of Thebes, Memphis, Nine-  veh, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon the Great,   as well as Jerusalem itself, all have fallen  when they were ripened in iniquity, and  all this in fulfilment of the word of the   Lord through the mouths of holy men,  who spoke as they were moved upon by   the inspiration of eternal truth. The  Lord has already swept off two great  nations from the American continent, in  fulfilment of His word, when they were  ripened in iniquity, and what inspired  man can look with indifference upon the  vortex into which the American govern-  ment is hastening, through the same pro-  cess, to their utter destruction and over-  throw? Who will save the American flag  and Consititution? I heard Joseph Smith  say, the Elders of Israel would have it  to do, and he was a Prophet of God.  Therefore, prepare yourselves, O ye  nations of the earth, for that which  awaits you, for the God of heaven has a  controversy with the nations! The Lord  will disappoint no one for the want of  the fulfilment of any of His words; and  when I reflect that there is not one of   the Apostles dwelling in the flesh who  opened the doors of salvation in the 
 TO THE Y.M.M.I.A.    OFFICE OF GENERAL SUPERINTEN-  DENCY Y.M.M.I.A.,    SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 15, 1895.    To the Officers and Members of the   Young Men's Mutual Improvement   Associations throughout Zion:    Dear Brethren—There have already   been issued and distributed among the   Stakes of Zion 17,500 copies of the   Mutual Improvement Association   Manual, Part I, and still there is a de-  mand for this work for use among new   members of these associations. There  is also a call for a compilation of ad-  vanced lessons of Manual, Part II,   which have been and will continue to   be published in the Contributor.    Through the failure of the young   men in paying their annual fifty cent   donations the General Superintend-  ency are unable to publish and distrib-  ute free these works, upon which the   success of the associations so greatly   depends.    Under the pressing circumstances it   is deemed advisable to secure the pub-  lication of a new edition of Manual,   Part I, and a pamphlet containing   twelve lessons in each of the subjects   planned for Manual, Part II.    The Contributor Co., therefore, act-  ing under our approval and advice,   will issue another edition of Part I of   the Manual, which they will sell the   associations at twenty-five cents (25c.)   per copy postpaid, with reasonable re-  duction in quantities.    They will also issue for the use of   the associations which have completed   Part I, and need some more advanced   studies, a pamphlet containing the   first twelve (12) lessons in each of the   subjects planned for Part II. This   will be sold at fifteen cents (15c.) per   copy, postpaid.    Both of these pamphlets will be on   sale at the Contributor Office, Salt   Lake City, where they can be ob-  tained at any time after December 26,   1894.    We hope the young men will take   an interest in these lessons and pur-  chase them regularly, thus acquiring a   fund of information which will be use-  ful to them in the ministry,  either at   home or abroad.    Your Brethren in the Gospel,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  JOSEPH F. SMITH,   MOSES THATCHER. 
 TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE.    Circular of the General Superin-  tendency to the M.I.A.    To the Young Men and Women of Zion:    It is with satisfaction and pleasure   that we announce the publication of   the First Year's Series of the Mutual  Improvement Association Course of   Reading. The five volumes which it   comprises have been issued from the   press, enclosed in a neat case, and are   now ready for delivery. They are as   follows:    I. The Gospel, by B. H. Roberts.    II. History of England, by Charles  Dickens.    III. First Book of Nature, by Jas.   E. Talmage.    IV. Life of Nephi, by George Q.   Cannon.    V. Readings from Washington Ir-  ving.    We have authorized the issue, by the  Contributor Company, of three thous-  and sets of this series, and trust there  will be found among you many times   that number of readers.    Order blanks have been issued to   the presidents of the Y.M.M.I.A.   who have been requested to canvass  for and receive subscriptions, in their   respective wards.    The books are sold only in sets, and  profits arising from their sale will be   reserved for the issue of succeeding   [se]ries. The price per set of five vol-  umes is $2.50 in advance. When pay-  ments are made by instalment the  price is $3 per set. All orders and re-  mittances of money should be ad-  dressed to the Contributor Company   No. 40 Main Street, Salt Lake City.    It is suggested that the reading be   commenced as early as possible in   December and continued through Jan-  uary, February, March and April, fin-  ishing in time for complete reports to   be made by May 1st. The officers of   Associations should keep a record of   the number of readers and of those   who answer the printed questions   upon the themes treated of, which   will be distributed to the readers later   in the season.    In recommending this Course of   Reading to our young people it is in   the hope that they will take up these  books and read them carefully and  methodically with a view to forming   attentive and thoughtful habits of   reading, and of thoroughly mastering  the contents of the volumes read. We   cannot over-estimate the good that   will follow such a course if faithfully   pursued; and we confidently solicit   the kind consideration of our people,   young and old, for this effort now be-  ing made for the mental and moral   improvement of the young men and   women of Zion.

 PIONEER REMINISCENCES.    The Builder of the First Chimney  —Father of the First Child—Mak-  er of the First Gaiter Boots—A   General and Local Pioneer.    We are permitted to present the fol-  lowing interesting communication:    TOQUERVILLE, Washington County,  Utah Territory.    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother— In the midst of all the  ups and downs that we as a people are  called upon to pass through in this  lower world, I still feel it a joy and  satisfaction to celebrate the Twenty-  ty-fourth of July, our Pioneer Day.    In looking over the DESERET NEWS  matter from Monday's daily of July  23, 1888, I feel flattered with the eulogy  therein contained, not particularly on  account of the praise to those alone  who were pioneers, for they in reality  could not do so any different. But, praise  to God, our heavenly Father, who  pioneered us here. Although I was  not numbered among the 143 who came  as that noble band, I was with you  nearly all the way from Green River,  and only stayed back to let the Presi-  dent's company keep on the lead.  You remember coming out on the east  bench to meet the battalion detach   ment, under Captain James Brown. I  was then one of the boys, and I im-  mediately went to work making ado-  bies and laying them up into the fort  wall of what was called the Old Fort,  of which I believe I built about one-  half with my own hands. I know I  built the first chimney that ever drew  smoke in these valleys. It was for  President Brigham Young, in a log  house on the east side of the Fort.    As it is comforting to recount the  reminiscences of the past, when they  bring pleasing recollections of having  done our duty, and as there must  always be a first, I have the honor of   being the father of the    FIRST CHILD BORN IN THE VALLEY.    It was named after President Young,  Young Elizabeth Steele, born August  9th, 1847, at 3:40 a.m. I also made  the first lasts and the first gaiter boots  that were made in these valleys. I can  now say with pleasure that that same  baby girl, then born, is a handsome  matron, having married one Mr. James  Stapley, and now lives at Kanarrah,  Iron County, Utah Territory. She is  the mother of five sons and two   daughters, and is now a grandmother.    I was one of the Pioneers who came  to Iron County with President George  A. Smith, in 1850, and have helped to  develop this Southern country, taking  an active part in building up and de-  [f]ending our possessions from Indian  and white men's depredations. I also   spent two years on a mission among  [t]he Indians and enjoyed myself very  much among them, and do not think  the Red man beyond the pale of re-  demption. I have observed many good  traits of character among them; one  is, that they are generally true to their  [f]riends.    I take great comfort in thinking over  old times, and am pleased to see that  my old friend William Carter, who  turned the first sod in the valley, has   not been forgotten. He did more  ditching in one day than I could do.  He ditched 16 rods, three feet wide  and three and half feet deep in one day.  There are many of my old pioneer and   soldier brethren that I remember with  pleasure, and as the DESERET NEWS  says, will be remembered with pleas-  ure in after generations, as their valor  and integrity is not at present fully ap-  preciated, but posterity will do them  [j]ustice. I can rejoice to learn of the   [i]ncrease of our people and the spread  of truth. Whereas, on the 24th of July,  1847, there were 143 pioneers and 150  battalion boys and some 20 of our sis-  ters, who are mothers in Israel, also a   few Mississippi Saints, who wintered  at Pueblo, now in Colorade State  who were the little nucleus around  which gathered so many thousands  and have spread around into other  territories, it makes me think of a sum  in multiplication in compound num-  bers. If six will multiply in fifty-eight  years into 300,000, what will 300,000 mul-  tiply into in the next fifty-eight years if   all are faithful in keeping the com-  mandments of the Lord. If Israel had  only allowed themselves to have been  governed by good counsel, where  there are now a few Saints there  would have been many. However,  Israel is on the increase, and will  never be less, and the little affliction  wherewith we are afflicted is merely a  fatherly hint that we are not forgotten  by Him. I thank God all the time that  we are not allowed to run wild like  sheep without a shepherd, and I hope   the time is not far distant when we   will see our Apostles and leading  brethren among us once more.    In our little town our superintend-  ent of Sunday school gathered his  little flock around him, organized  them in good shape, and we spent our  24th in singing, reciting, etc. I had  the pleasure of making a ten minutes  speech. All went off well with a  dance in the evening, presided over by  Brother Martin Slack.    We are trying to hold the fort while  our Bishop Wm. A. Bringhurst is in  prison for obeying the law of the  Lord. It is said in the Scriptures the   time will come when the Lord will  take to Him His great power, and   rule the nations, and Zion will arise  and shine.    I am thankful that your health is  still good, although you are not per-  mitted to be among us. I constantly  pray for our leading brethren; those  whom the Lord has chosen to lead His  people, and may God continue to you  long life, health and peace, and pros-  perity to Israel is the constant prayer   of your brother in the Gospel.    JOHN STEELE.    It appears proper, in connection   with the foregoing, to state that  Brother Joseph Harker, of Taylors-  ville, this county, claims to be the  father of the first male child born in  this valley or rather its vicinity. His  son William Harker, who is still liv-  ing in the same ward where his father  resides, was born in Echo Cañon, Utah,  while the family were traveling hither-  ward, on September 26th, 1847. Brother  Joseph Harker also erected the first  cabin on the west side of Jordan River,  in November and December, 1848. We  had the pleasure of a call from the  veteran this afternoon. 
 To the Pioneers and Citizens, and to the  Officers and Members of the Sabbath  Schools:    My Dear Friends: Forty-one years  ago this day I passed through Emigra-  tion Cañon with President' Brigham   Young. He was taken sick on East  Cañon Creek, and I made a bed for him  in my carriage. When we came upon  the bench I turned the side  of the vehicle to the west so that he   could obtain a fair view of the valley.  President Young arose from his bed  and took a survey of the country be-  fore him for several minutes. He then  said to me, "Drive on down in[t]o the   valley, this is our abiding place. I   have seen it before in vision. In this  valley will be built the City of the  Saints and the Temple of our God."  I drove down to the encampent al-  ready formed by a portion of  our company, who had cut a   road through the quakingasp groves  of timber which were in the bed of   the cañon and come in ahead of us.    We arrived in the encampment at  half-past eleven of the morning of the  24th of July, 1847. The brethren had  already turned out City Creek and irri-  gated the dry and barren soil, being  the first irrigation ever performed by  any one in these mountains in this age.  They had also commenced to plough  some ground, and that noble pioneer,  William Carter, whose circumstances  prevent his meeting with the pioneers  today, broke the first ground and laid  the first furrow. The plowshare that  performed the work is on the stand to-  day. On my arrival in camp, before I   ate my dinner, I planted two bushels  of potatoes in the ground broken up.  President Young commenced to re-  cover from his sickness the hour he  entered the valley. On a day or two  following our arrival, a remarkable in-  cident occurred.    While President Young was walking  with several of the Apostles on the  higher ground northwest of our en-  campment, he suddenly stepped out,  stuck his cane into the barren ground  and sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right  here will stand the Temple of our  God." We had a peg driven down and  it was nearly in the middle of the  Temple as it stands today, which Tem-  ple was built without any regard to the  spot designated by President Young at  the time.    On the 26th, we went to the  top of a high point on the  north of the city, which Presi-  dent Young named "Ensign Peak."  We also visited the Hot and Warm  Springs. On the 27th we drove to the  West Mountains and visited the Salt  Lake, President Young being the first to  dip his hand into the briny water. We  walked dryshod to the Black Rock and  took a bath in the Lake. Afterwards  preparations were made for laying out  the city, and I with other brethren as-  sisted President Young in laying out  the ground and streets with chain and  compass. We laid out a block of ten  acres upon which to build a Temple,  and city lots of one acre and a  quarter, and streets eight rods wide,  all of which has been published by his-  torians.    President Young left Winter Quar-  ters on the seventh day of April, ac-  companied by seven other Apostles and  other men, all told 143 men and 3  women. The Apostles were Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball, W. Wood-  ruff, George A. Smith, Willard Rich-  ards, Orson Pratt, Amasa Lyman and  Ezra T. Benson. Parley [P.] Pratt and  John Taylor arrived soon after, lead-  ing companies of families. Orson  Hyde remained at Kanesville. We trav-  eled the first 500 miles without any   grass. With the exception of a little  grain we fed our animals, they lived  entirely on the bark of cottonwood  limbs and saplings, which they  gnawed from the trees we would  lay before them for their night's  meal. This company of 143 men  traveled 1030 miles, making their  roads and building their bridges. In  one instance we had to form a guard  of a wedge shape for three days and  nights to keep our company from being  trampled to death by an enormous  herd of buffalo that had gathered from   the mountains and were migrating in  a solid body to the plains below. The  herd was judged to be sixty miles in  length, and numbered not less than  one million. They were traveling east  and we were traveling west. We were  three days passing though the herd,  and we all breathed freer when we  were clear of them. No other class of  men will ever witness the same scene  again upon the face of the earth.  Brother Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got  his horses loose and mixed with the  herd, and it was with great difficulty  that we obtained them again.    Notwithstanding our first care was  to secure an abiding place, a home for  the people, we did not lose sight  of other important matters. President  Young contemplated at that early day  the building of a railroad across the  continent, and we marked out the  route which we thought the national  road would take to unite the Atlantic  and Pacific oceans.    Brothers Orson Pratt and Erastus   Snow entered the valley two or three  days before the body of the pioneers;  but where are those men today, and  where is President Brigham Young and  the Apostles who accompanied him?  All are in the spirit world mingling  with the martyred Prophets where  they can plead for their brethren. Not  one of them living today except my-  self, and but few of the pioneers re-  main. We have buried a whole quo-  rum of Twelve Apostles since we en-  tered these valleys of the mountains.  The remnant of Zion's Camp, Mormon  Battalion and the Pioneers number but  very few today. Those of us who re-  main will soon pass away, but our  posterity live and are numbered in the   Primaries, the Sabbath schools and  the Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions, and are this day assembled in  this great Tabernacle to celebrate the  arrival of the Pioneers into this great  American Deseret, which today  through the blessing of God and the  labor of the Pioneers is blossoming as  the rose.    This company of pioneers spent  about a month in this valley during  which period we erected what is   known as the Old Fort, surrounding  three sides of the ten-acre block, with  an adobie wall about ten feet high on  the outside, and the east side with log  cabins. We also arranged for this fort  to have four entrances, one on each  point of the compass.    Most of the Pioneers returned to  Winter Quarters where they arrived  in the fall, making a jorney of over  two thousand miles, besides the labors  performed while here in building a  fort, laying out the city and exploring  the adjacent valleys.    I wish to say a few words to the  members of the Sabbath Schools and  to all who are assembled in this Tab-  ernancle today to celebrate the arrival of  the Pioneers into this valley. It is not  wisdom for me to occupy your time  with a long address upon an occasion  of this kind, but I have referred to a  few incidents of our peculiar journey  into this barren desert, that you may  keep in mind the toil, the care and the  harships which your fathers endured  in laying the foundation of the Zion of  our God which is to be established in   the mountains of Israel, in fulfillment  of the blessing of the old Patri-  arch Jacob pronounced upon his pos-  terity that should be fulfilled in the  valleys of the everlasting hills in the  latter-days. And upon the heads of  the rising generation of the Latter-  day Saints rests the responsiblity of  building up the Kingdom of God upon  the foundations which their fathers  have laid. And also of building up a  State in which shall dwell virtue, tem-  perance, industry, frugality and hon-  esty; a State which will do honor to   the American government, where  wholesome laws shall be administed  in equity and justice to all of its citi  zens according to the letter and spirit  of the Constitution given by inspira-  tion of Almighty God to our fore-  fathers.    I feel to say to our children, Honor  your father and your mother and your  God, that your days may be long and  prosperous in these valleys ol [of] the  mountains which the Lord your God  hath given unto you.    That God may bless you all, and en-  able you to fulfill the object of your  creation here on the earth to the satis-  faction of yourselves and your Crea-  tor, is the earnest desire of your friend  and brother,    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 President Woodruff said sixty years  ago this season he traveled with the  Prophet Joseph a thousand miles  in Zion's camp. There were three of  that camp here today. Forty-seven  years ago he entered this valley with  the Prophet Brigham. He did not  then expect to see such a place as this  built by the Latter-day Saints. He  blessed the people and expressed the   hope that they might have the privi-  lege of associating together on the  other side of the veil, when they were  called hence. 
 British dominions in 1837, and but two   who assisted in baptizing some seven  thousand in 1840, and that our mis-  sion and labors will soon be found upon  the other side of the vail—I say, while  these reflections rest upon me, I feel de-  sirous to urge upon my brethren, the  Elders of Israel, to labor faithfully while  the day lasts. Try to save the souls of   men. Bless and not curse. Keep pure  and clean before the Lord. Pray ear-  nestly for the Holy Spirit to guide you.  Be patient in well doing. If you are  persecuted and derided for the Gospel's  sake, remember that Jesus has trod   that road before you, and descended  lower than ever you will be called to go;  and if you are cast out of doors and get  hungry, have to travel on foot, get weary  and sore, and are without money, re-  member that others, even your fathers  after the flesh, have passed through the  same ordeal. Brigham and Heber, Wil-  lard and John, Parley and Orson, Wil-  ford and George A., have traveled over  the same road, preached in the same  halls and streets, got hungry the same  as you are. We are all in the same old  ship of Zion, and thanks be to God for  the privilege.    Be of good cheer. Though earth and  hell conspire against you, they shall not  prevail if you are built upon my rock,  saith the Lord. May the blessings and  power of God, with His Holy Spirit, rest  upon all the Elders and Saints of God  in the vineyard of the Lord, as well as  those in Zion.    Wilford Woodruff.    Where law ends, tyranny begins. 
 Written for this Paper.    SOUTHERN STATES MISSION.    Following is the report of the  Southern States mission, made to  President Wilford Woodruff, by Elder  Kimball:    Having finished my labors in the  Southern States, I desire to make a   written report, trusting that it will be  satisfactory and meet with your ap-  proval.    The mission is in excellent condi-  tion, and in no other time since 1877  has there been as good an opportunity  for proselyting. There are 126 effici-  ent Elders laboring in the South, and  they are the best qualified laborers  the mission has ever had at any one  time. There is not a sick Elder at  present writing.    We find that about twelve per cent  of the Elders are honorably released  on account of sickness. Brethren over  forty years old, in almost every in-  stance are released on account of ill  health before the two years expire, and  we can only remember of one man of  that age remaining that long.    The 126 Elders are laboring in 63  counties. During the three years that   I have presided 98 counties have been  systematically canvassed, from house  to house, village to village, and city to   city. Said counties are closed, for the  present at least.    There are 1,150 counties in the  twelve Southern States, with a popula-  tion of between sixteen and seventeen  million people. By a great deal of  hard work we have ascertained that  371 counties have been labored in to  some extent since 1877, and during  that time 877 Elders have labored in  the South. By this we conclude that   not one-third of the people ever heard  the Gospel.    The last quarterly report shows that  we have a total of 1,859 members,  twelve branches and six Sunday  schools.    The following report will give an   [i]dea of the labors of the mission from  Jan. 1st, 1894, to April 30th, 1894:    Pairs of Elders walked 42,194 miles.  Meetings held, 897. Families visited,  16,576. Refused entertainment (one  out of every five families), 3,211.  Baptisms (will increase to 300 or 350  during the year), 71. Tracts distrib-  uted, 22,359. This will complete my  report, and in conclusion I will state  that I am one hundred fold rewarded  for my labors, and thank you very  much for the good counsel and many  acts of kindness extended to me, all of  which I appreciate.    Elder Elias S. Kimball, my suc-  cessor, is now familiar with his duties.  The mission's finance is all right and  the debts all paid. At Chattanooga we  have many influential friends, and  find a most remarkable change in our  favor.    Ever praying for your welfare and  that of our brethren of the authorities.  I remain,    Your brother in the Gospel, etc.,  J. G. KIMBALL. 
 THE SAMOAN MISSION.    Interesting Account and Statistics  From its President.    AUNUU, Samoan Islands,  October 30th, 1888.    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother: Onr [Our] new mission-  aries, Elder Wm. O. Lee, wife and  child, and Elders Adelbert Beesley and  Ed. J. Wood arrived on the 10th inst.,  safe and sounds, and were met by  Brother Manoa and myself with a  crew of natives, at the steamer. We  had a terrible time waiting for the  steamer, however, as it was four days  behind advertized time, having had to  wait in San Francisco for the British  mails.  We spent most of that time  day and night, in sun and rain, out to  sea in the open boat, fearing to go  ashore lest, when the steamer came,  we could not reach it in time. After  looking anxionsly at the horizon from  Saturday noon till Tuesday night in  vain, and being quite exhansted from  exposure and want of sleep, we were  quite disheartened. Wednesday morn-  ing at daylight, however, the steamer  was sighted, and we immediately for-  got all our troubles and put off to  meet her.    The schooner that takes the mail got  there first, however, and being four   days behind time the officers of the   steamer would not delay a second the   bundling of the baggage for Samoa  into her. So by the time we got there  most of the brethren's baggage had  been transferred, and we had to pay $2  for the accommodation of getting it  away from them again.  We finally got  every thing all right and had a pretty  pleasant passage in our boat to Aunuu.  We arrived here next morning at 9  o'clock, badly worn out bodily, but  feeling well in spirits. Brother Manoa  was taken down with a heavy fever  throngh exposure and exhaustion, he  not being very strong. The rest of us  were all right after a night's rest.  Manoa is around all right again now.    Your kind letter sent by the brethren,  together with the shoes, shoe-mending  "kit" and medicines came all right  and was greatly appreciated, the shoes   especially. Our friends also remem-  bered us in a very liberal manner.  God bless you all for yonr kindness.    You say you wrote me under date of   August 13. It has never reached me,  nor have other letters for the same   month. But I think, probably, I will  get them yet, when we can go for onr  mail.    Since I last wrote you, Brother C. K.  Kapule has arrived from the Sandwich  Islands. He got here Aug. 13th, and  has been here ever since. He has sold  all that he had on the Sandwich Is-  lands (some $3000 worth of property)  and when he is released from his mis-  sion he intends to go to Utah. It will   be quite a task for him to get the  language, but he is stndying diligently  and will soon be able to talk some I   think.    On Aug. 27th Brother Kapule and I  went to the island of Tutnila for a  week's missionary trip. Two days af-  terward Manoa sent me word that  there was great exitement on Annuu  through word having reached there to  the effect that the governor of Tntuila  had received orders from the Germans  to have me and all those who had  joined the Church arrested and taken  to Apia. He thonght I had better re-  turn immediately. Not wishing to do  so until I had visited the settlements  or villages that I desired to, I sent  back word where I would be each day  until I returned, and that if any officer  wanted me they were to direct him  where to find me. I was inclined to   think the thing was all a canard at   first, but subsequent investigation has  shown that there was considerable   foundation for the report. Of course  you are aware that the Germans have  been dictating affiars here for a year  or two past. A German named Bran-  daus has been prime minister to the  King. His salary was $250 per month,  the king's $25, and the Chinaman  cook's $30. This Brandans having  heard that we were here and meeting  with considerable snccess, sent word  to the governor of Tutuila and Aunun  to proclaim on the two islands that if,  after the proclamation, any Samoan  should join the Church he should be  imprisoned. That was the foundation  upon which the first rumors we heard  were founded. A week or so after the  governor started to "proclaim;" he  had not got many miles from home be-  fore a vessel arrived from the capital  bringing word that the natives on the  island of Upoln had taken up arms  against the government and over-  thrown it, and had chosen Mataala as  king. The governor said if that was  the case he would return, for if the  government were overthrown he was  governor no longer. And that was the  last we have heard of the matter, of-  ficially.    The war altogether has been confined  to Upolu, and has consisted of three  battles in which the rebels have been  victorious. Both parties are still in  arms and which way it will finally be  decided depends upon the action of the  great powers, England, Germany and  America. Since the scare started, that   is, that those who joined the Church   would be arrested, we have had but  one application for baptism, and that  a young boy. A good many are believ-  ing, but they are afraid the Germans will  return to power and that the threat will  be carried out. They say there is no  need for hurrying, and they will wait  and see how things turn out. When  the war is over and things quiet down  again, if the German's retain their  grip (which they are almost sure to do  I am afraid) and the natives are still  afraid of being arrested, I think I shall  go to the capital and begin work right  at headquarters, and thereby sound  the thing to the bottom and see what   they will do. I can bear anything bet-  ter than nncertainty. I feel certain  that the Lord will overrule it all for  good. We have received quite an ex-  tensive advertizing as it is.    I have not done mnch missionary  work yet outside of this little island  for several reasons. Having some  forty souls here that have accepted my  testimony and joined the Church, I   thought it foolish to leave them in ig-  norance and rnn to hunt other bap-  tisms, until I could ground them  snfficiently in the faith that they  could stand alone, or until some one  could come and take my place. My   policy has always been to labor as  hard to keep a member as to get a new  one and not to spread my wings over  more eggs than I can keep warm. And   to carry the hen comparison a little  further, I can assure yon it has kept  me busy "clucking aud scratching" to   keep my little brood straight. Another  reason is that I have had to get the   language, which I bave not yet ac-  complished by considerable, having  been here but a little over four montbs,  and I have also been working with the   natives building us a meeting house.    Since the brethren arrived we have  been working every day together on it,  and finally got it finished last Saturday.  It is 36 x 18 feet and very comfortable   and commodious, and we all feel  proud of it. The roof is of thatch-  work of cocoanut leaves. The posts  are ronnd cocoanut trees with the  bark hewn off and the floor is covered  with clean white coral pebbles from  the beach with a good sprinkling of  sea shel[l]s among them. I made a   stand by hewing a large cocoanut tree  flat on one side and placing it flat side  up on two posts firmly planted in the   ground. I made it as nice as I could  with a hatchet and an old jack plane  that Manoa has.    Elder Wood says it is a nice piece of  furnitnre, and he ought to know hav-  ing worked in Brother Dinwoodey's   store. In commemoration of the   completion of the house, we had a  feast last Saturday, and then an   entertainment, which was quite cred-  itably rendered, and pleased the na-  tives immensely. It consisted of  hymns by us missionaries. Xylophone  and violin solos by Elder Beesley,  speeches, etc., and songs in Hawaiian.    On Sunday, October 28, we held our  first Conference. All the missionaries  were present, also all the Saints that  could come. We sang hymn 64, Sa-  moan Church of England hymn book,   beginniug with the words "Ua tele le  Alofa."  I offered prayer and dedi-  cated our new meeting house to the   Lord. The missionaries then sang  "Come, come ye Saints, no toil nor  labor fear." I explained to the peo-  ple the nature of a conference as held  semi-annually in the church, and then  presented the Anthorities of the  Church, and all voted to sustain them   with their faith and prayers.    The statistical report of the mission  was then read, which is as follows:    Statistical report, Samoan Mission, to  October 6, 1888:    Missionaries—Male, 0, female, 2.  Elders, 2. Priests, 1.  Deacons, 3.  Total officers, 6. Members—Male, 13,  female, 16; total members, 29; total  officers and members, 35. Children  under 8—Male, 2, female, 8; total chil-  dren, 10; total souls, 56. Deaths, 1.    We also organized a Sunday School   and Relief Society, with the following  officers, who were unanimously sus-  tained:    Wm. O. Lee Superintendent of the  Sunday School; A. Beesley and S.  Manoa, counselors, F. R. Dean, Presi-  dent of the Rellef Society; Louisa C.  Lee and Leutuva, Counselors.  Pa-  loga was chosen a missionary to travel  with me on the island of Tutuila.  He  was ordained a Priest.  Chief Lemaza  made a few remarks.  Singing.  Bene-  diction by S. Manoa.    Met again at 3 p.m. Prayer by Le-  mafa.  Brother C. K. Kapnle arose  and made his "maiden" speech in the  Samoan langnage.  The rest of the  meeting was occupied by myself and  Elder W. O. Lee, the latter of course  speaking in English, which I interpre-  ted.  Singing.  Dismissed by Brother   Beesley.  Thus ended our first confer-  ence on the Samoan Islands.    Having got our meeting house done  and the new missionaries settled, I  now feel justified in leaving Aunuu in  charge of Brothers Lee, Kapule and   Manoa, and taking Elders Beesley and  Wood with me and Paloga to make a  thorough canvass and circuit of Tu-  tuila.  There are some 3000 inhabitants,  and it will probably take ns two   months to go around.  We leave day  after tomorrow, nothing preventing.    I am mnch pleased with the spirit  manifested by the brethren, and be-  lleve they will make good mission-  aries.  They are stndying hard to  get the language, and feel well in  every way.  They are also taking to  the food very well, but Sister Lee  can't get along quite so well, bnt will  gradually get used to it I think.    Brother Manoa has given up his en-  tire house to us and is living by him-  self in another he has adjoining.  He  has been financially embarrassed, how-  ever, for some time, and can therefore  not help us financially.  We would  feel much better in a honse of our  own.  There is no use thinking of  making this little island our perma-  nent headquarters, however.  There  is no land to be gotten.  We are 78   miles from supplies and mail connec-  tions, and a way from the great body of  the natives.  What we need is a few  acres of ground in some good situation  on the island of Upolu, where we   could build our own honses and grow  our own food and be near mail con-  nections aud base of supplies.  But  these things will have to be developed  in the future as circumstances permit.  As yet I am single handed and alone,  practically, being the only one that can  speak the language.  It will take two  or three years to get things well  started, as the brethren have to have  time to get the langnage, and we have  to take things as we find them and  make the best of them.    We all feel well in the work in which  we are engaged, and there seems to be  a lively and energetic spirit among all  the missionaries.  On account of the   unsettled condition of affairs on the  islands I don't think it wonld be wise  for any more missionaries to come at  present, though a dozen Elders with   the language could be used to good   advantage.    The brethren and sisters all send af-  fectionate regards.  And we all pray  that you may be strengthened and  blessed, and preserved from your ene-  mies.    Please to remember me kindly to  Brother Geo. Q Cannon and the  brethren at the office.    Your brother in the Gospel,  JOSEPH H. DEAN. 
 SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 24, 1894.    Wilford Woodruff, President of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints:    Dear sir: Heretofore the  Tribune has  reported you and others in authority  in your Church as giving utterance to   the sentiment that the Mormon people  ought to divide upon national party  lines, according to the political senti-  ments which each man might entertain,  without interference in any way from  officials of your Church in that mat-  ter. Frequently has that utterance  been given, and the public has  come to rely upon it as fixed and  final. Now, however, this feeling of  safety from Church interference in poli-  tics has been disturbed, and a fresh  source of unrest introduced by a report  which appeared in the Tribune this  morning of your remarks yesterday at  Provo. The report was made by a man  in complete sympathy with yourself so  far as Church affairs go, and who, it is  certain, would refuse to misreport you in  any way. Subsequent inquiry develops  that he is confident in the accuracy of  his report of your remarks as he under-  stood them. The portion of that report  which causes uneasiness is the following:    "It is generally thought the First Presidency  should have nothing to say about politics," he  continued. "I picked up a paper this morning  saying that we had no business to meddle in  politics. We have a right to lead the people in   spiritual and temporal affairs. We have the  same rights of leadership that President  Young had, and that the Prophet Joseph  Smith had. In temporal affairs? Yes. In   political affairs? Yes. We have a right to ad-  vise both Democrats and Republicans to lead a   pure campaign. We have a right to say to the  people that they must be pure in politics as  well as in temporal affairs. We have thou-  sands of children growing to manhood in Zion.  I am interested in their welfare, and I would  like to see them brought up under proper in-  fluences, and not under the influence of such  a campaign as we had two years ago."    The purpose of this inquiry is to ascer-  tain with exactness,    First, whether your remarks were pre-  cisely as reported, and, if not, wherein  they depart from precision.    Second, if the remarks were as report-  ed, then in what sense do you wish them  to be understood: whether as a claim to  control the political actions of your people  absolutely, or only as a citizen to advise  the right.    Third, the claim is apparently made in  your remarks that the Church authorities  claim the right to direct the people in  their business and politics, and, in gen-  eral, their temporal affairs, as well as  spiritual. It is desirable to know  whether this claim is really made and  insisted upon at this time, and is to be in  the future, while the public has been led  to believe that claim a thing of the past.  Most respectfully,    TRIBUNE PUBLISHING CO. 
 Salt Lake Tribune:    Gentlemen—Answering the first ques-  tion in your note, I have to say that I   believe the extract you quote from your   report of my remarks at Provo is sub-  stantially correct.    To the second, my reply is that "the   control of the political actions of our   people absolutely" is not set up as a claim  in my remarks, and I certainly would not   wish them to be so understood. I hold   that it is the right of the Priesthood   to advise at any and all times and under  any circumstances those who pro-  fess to respect its powers, in all   matters pertaining to their tem-  poral welfare and their spiritual sal-  vation; if in the matter of politics,   that the Latter-day Saints should be   governed by pure principles, and in po-  litical affairs should realize and act upon   their responsibilities as Saints and   citizens. This is not to claim the right  to advise them how or for whom they   should vote, or which party they should   join. We emphatically and sincerely   approved the division of the Mormon   people on party lines, and we recognize   every man's agency and respect his   right to choose in these matters for   himself. We have not advised, and do   not advise our people how they shall   vote; the elections that have been held  in this Territory since politics on na-  tional party lines was introduced, are   proof of this policy; we have asked no  Republican to vote the Democratic tick-  et, and no Democrat to vote the Repub-  lican ticket; we have never advised men  to vote other than their convictions   prompted them, and have no intention   of giving such advice. At the same   time, we claim the right, both as indi-  viduals and as leaders of the Church, to   counsel our people to keep aloof from  the corruption, the scandal and the filfth   of politics as too frequently practiced in   the world, to set an example in this as   in other things, and it is in this sense   that I wish to be understood as as-  serting the right of the Priesthood to give  counsel in political affairs. As citizens   we have the right of opinion and of   speech; we also have responsibilities and   duties to ourselves and to others; but  until the foregoing can be construed as  meddling in politics, I shall be unable to  find ground for the uneasiness of which   you speak. However, in the light of  this statement of my meaning and views,  I trust there can be no further cause of   anxiety or unrest; I assure you there is  no foundation for it.    Yours respectfully,   WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE,    Covering the period from the time named   in their last report, made October 6,  1884, until December 31, 1885.    We, the undersigned, auditors ap-  pointed at the General Conference of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, to examine and audit the  books and the accounts of the Trustee-  in-Trust of the said Church, after a   careful and thorough examination and  comparison made by ourselves and by   competent assistants, of the receipts of  cash and other property from all  sources by the said Trustee-in-Trust,  and the accounts of the expenditures of  the same, during the past two years,   since we made our last report, do   hereby certify that we have found the  accounts strictly correct, and of the  most satisfactory character. We have  found that, after allowing for the   amounts paid out, the balance is fully  accounted for by cash on hand and   inventoried property.    We cannot close this, our report, in  justce to the Trustee-in-Trust, and for  the satisfaction of the Latter-day  Saints in Conference assembled, with-  out saying that we have been much   gratified, in our examination of the  books and accounts, with the prudent,  economical, and strict manner in   which the funds that have come into  the hands of the Trustee-in-Trust have  been managed.    All obligations have been promptly  met, the business has been placed on a   most satisfactory basis, debts have  been liquidated, and the financial con-  dition and standing of the Church are  most satisfactory.    This condition of the affairs is very  pleasant for us to contemplate, as we  know the statement will be to the   Saints in General Conference as-  sembled.    We remain, your brethren,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  ERASTUS SNOW,  FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS,    Auditing Committee. 
 CIRCULAR LETTER.    OFFICE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY   OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF   LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,  November 22, 1894.    To the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops  of Wards:    DEAR BRETHREN—In December,   1891, acting un[d]er our advice an[d]   direction, an associati[o]n was formed  consisting of some twenty-seven per  sons ([f]or the most part, sons of the   Pioneers), with ours[e]lves as an advis-  ory board, for the purpose of attending   to the detail w[o]rk of the erection of a   monument to the Pioneers of Utah   and their distingui[s]hed leader, Presi-  dent Brigham Young. This associa-  tion immediately entered upon its   duties. A contract was entered into   with Mr. C. E. Dallin, a young   man born in this Territory who   had already attained an enviable repu-  tati[o]n as a sculptor, to perform the   work in accordance with designs made   by him and fully approved by us.   These designs provided for the erection   of a monument 35 feet in height upon   a granite pedestal which is to consist   of the following conspicuous features:   The sitting figures of an American   Indian and a Rocky Mountain trapper   in bronze 8 feet in height, illustrative   of the primitive conditions which ex  isted in this region before the advent  of the Pioneers; a Pioneer group con-  sisting of a man 8 feet in height, wo-  man, child and wagon, or prairie   schooner, to be cut in relief work upon  a marble shaft, or column, forming the   central feature of the monument; the   whole to be surmounted by a bronze   statue of President Brigham Young,   10 feet in height. The statue of Pres-  ident Young has been completed and   was on exhibition at the Worl[d]'s Fai[r]   in Chicago in 1893, where it received  widespread commendation both for the  faithfulness of the likeness and as a   work of art. It is now inside the   Temple Block in this city and ready  to be put in place. Models of the In-  dian and trapper have been executed   and approved, and are ready to be re-  produced in bronze as soon as [t]he neces-  sary funds can be raised. A model of the   Pioneer group has been submitted by the   sculptor and as soon as approved can   be cut in stone and made ready to b[e]   put in position. The site determine[d]   upon for the monument is the south-  east corner of the Temple Block, near   the spot where President Young stood   when Utah was but a wilderness, and   uttered the prophetic words: "Here   we will build the temple of our God."    For all of the work above describe[d]  put in position complete and [f]or super-  intendence of construction of the   monument, the sculptor, under the   contract, is to receive $25,000. Only   a few hundred dollars have as yet been   subscribed and paid in.    From this brief statement of the   conditions you will see how necessary   it is that immediate steps be taken t[o]   raise funds for this important work.   It is our hope that by next fall, in time   for the semi-annual conference, the  monument may be dedicated and un-  veiled to the vision of the people who   shall have contributed to build i[t]; and  there is no reason why our expecta  [t]ions in this regard may not be fully   realized if all the people will but take   [h]old and push the project with the  same determinati[o]n and unanimity of  [p]urpose which have builded our tem-  [p]les and accomplished so much in the   past.    It is now nearly half a century since  [t]he Pioneers entered this valley. Most   of those whose dauntless courage and   hardy prowess beat down the barriers   which opp[o]sed them in that historic   march of a th[o]usand miles of trackless  wilderness, overcome at last with the   [f]atiques of added years, have lain   their weary bodies down to rest within the  tomb where sleep the brave and the  just. We who remain are reaping the  [g]olden grain of their sowing—are   blessed with the results of their energy   and toil. Is it not fitting that we should   cheerfully and gratefully contribute  t[o]wards the erection of a monument   that will perpetuate down through the   ages the memory of the hardships and   privatio[n]s they endured for us? It is   the intention to have a complete roster  of that illustrious band of Pioneers en-  graven upon the main column of the   monument, just as their noble deeds   ought to be and are engraven forever   upon the hearts of their posterity.    We are aware that there are many   and varied calls for donations for   worthy purposes from the people, but   it is our desire that this call shall   be given first place and other consid-  erations of a public nature be regarded   as secondary until the work in   hand shall be completed. Heber   M. Wells, secretary of the   Brigham Young memorial fund,   Salt Lake City, is authorized to receive   subscriptions, and he will take pleasure   in issuing a receipt in the name of  every contributor, no matter how   small the sum. We extend an invita-  tion, throu[g]h the Presidency of the   various stakes and Bishops of wards, to   every man, woman and child through-  out our mountain home to contribute   something in commemoration of the   Pioneers and their great leader, Presi-  dent Brigham Young, whose genius   has left its impress in every part of this  favored land. Remember that no   amount, however small, will be refused,  as the purpose in view is to have a   monument that will belong to the   people who love and revere the mem-  ory of the Pio[n]eers.    Trusting that you will at once take  steps for the furtherance of this work   in your respective stakes and wards,   and praying the Lord to bless your   l[a]bors and those of the righteous  everywhere in the upbuilding of His   purposes, we remain,    Your brethren in the Gospel of Christ,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH,    First Presidency of the Church o[f]   Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 TO THE PUBLIC.    There is not a scintilla of truth in  the statements which have been and   are being made in certain quarters  concerning the Utah company.    The Utah company is a Utah con-  cern in every respect.    Every dollar of its stock is owned by  Utah people, viz., Wilford Woodruff,  George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith,   James Jack, Nephi W. Clayton,  William W. Cluff and Frank J.  Cannon.    The Utah company is not connected   in any manner with the sugar trust.  It has had no dealings with that trust,  or with any of its representatives.    We cannot say whether any repre-  sentatives of the sugar trust were or  are in Utah. We do not know them.    The inuendoes which associate any of  the undersigned with a proposition to  elect sugar trust senators are utterly  groundless and without any degree of   truth.    No papers connected with the Utah  company were signed at Provo at any  time. The articles of incorporation  were signed at Salt Lake City, filed in  the public office here, and their con-  tents have been current knowledge  ever since.    We have no knowledge that the  Lehi sugar works are to be closed down.  We should much deplore such a cal-  amity.    In our judgment, the insinuations  recently made against the business  purposes of the Utah company or its  members are not only unjust to them  but injurious to the community whose  financial redemption the Utah com-  pany is seeking to aid.

 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,  April 25th, 1890.    Prest. Woodruff and Council:    Gentlemen—The enclosed docu-  ment, with names attached, came  to me by today's mail.    In compliance with this expressed  desire of so many of our leading  citizens, as well as in the interest of  the Salt Lake Choral Society (rep-  resenting over three hundred of  Salt Lake's best vocalists and musi-  cians), and also the advancement of  music in its highest form, I hereby  appeal to you to grant us the use of  the only adequate building in the  Territory, the large Tabernacle,  wherein to hold our first "May  Musical Festival."    I will guarantee that the pro-  gramme shall be made up of the  noblest, highest class of music; that  nothing low or trivial shall be sung  to desecrate the house of worship;  and furthermore, that the proceeds,  after all necessary expenses are paid,  shall go to charitable purposes. One  of these we earnestly desire to be a  musical educational one, namely,  the furnishing of the district schools  of this city with more of the music  books now generally in use, for the  special benefit of children whose  parents cannot well afford to pur-  chase such text books.    Trusting that in the interest of  art, charity, and the music-loving  community of Utah and vicinity  you will be able to concede to this  request,    I remain, respectfully,  EVAN STEPHENS,    Conductor of Salt Lake Choral   Society. 
 SALT LAKE CITY, U. T.,  May 9th, 1890.    Evan Stephens, Esq., Salt Lake City:    Dear Brother—Your communica-  tion of April 25th, with enclosure  addressed to you by Mayor Geo. M.  Scott, J. R. Walker, Esq., W. S.  McCornick, Esq., and other leading  citizens, in relation to the holding  of a grand concert by the Choral  Society in the Tabernacle, in this  city, is received.    In answering we would say that  we have frequent applications for  the use of the Tabernacle for the  same or similar purposes, with pro-  posals for large monetary consider-  ations, which we have always de-  clined; but in this instance we have  decided to grant the request, on the  condition named in both communi-  cations, that after the expenses are  paid the balance shall be devoted to  charitable purposes. We are al-  ways pleased to lend our aid in  every consistent manner for the pro-  motion of music and the kindred  arts, that will tend to the elevation  and instruction of the people.    You will please confer with Bishop  John R. Winder, whom we have  authorized to act in our behalf in  making the necessary arrangements.    Very respectfully yours,  WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S VIEWS.    THE following account of an in-  terview between President Wood-  ruff and an Associated Press re-  porter, who was in this city a few  days ago, is published in the eastern  papers:    SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 11—Presi-  dent Woodruff, the head of the Mor-  mon church, today gave to the Asso-  ciated Press the only statement he has  ever made upon the political fight   which has just ended here. His inter-  view, which is as follows, can be un-  derstood as the feeling of every Mor-  mon in the Territory:    "President Woodruff, I would like  to get your views as to the political  campaign here and the questions at  issue"    "Well, sir, I consider this as some-  thing more than a mere question of  what men shall compose the city gov-  ernment and what party they belong  to. There is a deep-laid scheme to de-  prive the Mormon people of all po-  litical right and privileges so that the   minority here may obtain control of  the Territory. They cannot do this by  fair means, so they resort to foul.    "By misrepresentation and taking  advantage of popular predjudice against  the Mormon, founded chiefly in ig-  norance, they succeeded in securing  the disfranchisement of the older set-  tlers who made the country, and then  of all the women. This not giving  these schemers a majority, they have  sought other means. The Edmunds-  Tucker act has helped them some-  what, but the test oath it provides can  be taken by a majority at least as well  as by their opponents.    "Now they want every Mormon de-  prived of the right  to vote and hold  office, no matter how good and law-  abiding a citizen he may be. At the   Ogden election a year ago, large num-  bers of the names of resident voters  were stricken from the registration  lists, hundreds of non-residents were  imported and the election was carried  by the Liberals by open fraud, and  since then, by ficticious valuation, the  assessments of property have been  raised from three to five times the for-  mer amounts of taxes, vice has flour-  ished, official salaries have been   raised. Public improvements have  not advanced and the change is de-  plored by the best people of both par-  ties.    "Boasts were made after the Ogden  election, that Salt Lake would be the  next point of attack, and that it would  be carried by similar means. The re-  sult has proved the boast not to have  been made in vain.    "I consider the election has been   gained here by striking from the re-  gistration lists hundreds of legally   qualified citizens and by the votes of  hordes of new comers not lawful citi-  zens.    "I regard the action of the registrars,  their sitting as a court to judge of their  own acts, and the whole course pur-  sued, as part of the scheme to capture  the city at all hazards. I view it with  profound regret as prostitution of law  and official power that should sadden  every lover of fair play and welfare of  his country."    "What effect will this change have  upon the Church and the People's  Party?"    "Oh, as to that I cannot see that the   Church will in any way be affected as  an organization. It is entirely separ-  ate and apart from political matters;  members of the Church belong to the   People's Party, and they will natur-  ally feel that they have been robbed of  their rights at the polls. But I pre-  sume that it will not affect their polit-  ical views or status.    "The Church was not in that cam-  paign and the result will have no bear-  ing upon it at all that I can see."    "What will be the future policy of  the Church?"    "So far as I know, it will be to   preach the Gospel to all the world; in-  struct its members in their religious  duties, and move forward to its divini-  ty-ordained destiny as the actual liv-  ing Church of Christ."    "Is there any probability of the   Mormon Church or people removing  to Mexico or elsewhere?"    "None that I know of. I do not see  any necessity of such removal. Indi-  vidual members may go where they  choose to better their condition, but  there is not nor has there been any  contemplation of any such exodus as  you ask about."    "What is the Mormon idea of its  rule as the kingdom of God?"    "It is this: we hold that this Church  was set up and organized by com-  mand of the Almighty; that it has the  right to formulate and maintain rules  of church discipline applying to its  own members; that the extent of its  punitive powers is the excommunica-  tion of the transgressor; that it has no  power to punish anyone by depriva-  tion of life, liberty or property or pe[r]s-  sonal injury in any form; that gov-  ernments should not regulate the   church, nor the church seek to control  the state; that all men should be polit-  ically free and equal, free to vote as  they please and to sustain what poli-  tics they please, so that they do not  infringe upon the rights of others.    "We believe this Church will pre-  pare the way for the coming of Christ   to reign as King, and that this Church  will then develop into the Kingdom of   God, which all Christians pray will   come; that the will of God may be  done on earth as it is in heaven. We  believe in the full and free agency of  man, and that when the kingdom  is  established there will be perfect lib-  erty on earth, civil, political and re-  ligious."    "Then you do not feel gloomy as to   the ultimate result of this election?"    "No, I believe taxes will be raised,  that there will be such a looseness of  restraint imposed upon immorality  and such a striking contrast formed  under Liberal rule that order, honor,  honesty and consistent progress of the   city under the People's regime, that as  in Ogden, the more respectable people  of all classes will soon desire a return  to former methods. The plotters  against the majority will probably be  emboldened to pursue their plans for  the destruction of a republican gov-  ernment in the Territory, but I should  be sorry to believe that Congress or  the country will proceed to such un-  constitutional and infamous extrem-  ities as those that will be proposed. In  any event, there is a Power superior  to all men, who will overrule all  things that happen for the good of  those who serve Him."    President Woodruff appeared to be  in good health and not in the least  worried over the result of the election.  He is now in his 83rd year and ap-  parently as strong and well preserved  as the ordinary man at 50. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    spoke very briefly. He said he did  not believe there ever was a time in  the history of the world when there  existed so little faith among the  people with regard to God, His Son  Jesus Christ, and the gospel as was  the case today.    Just as soon as the Lord or-  ganized this Church, with the same  principles which belonged to it in  ancient days, it seemed as though  the whole world was stirred up  against them as a people. They  were therefore led to ask the cause  of all the opposition and persecu-  tion which had attended the Latter-  day Saints throughout the whole  Christian world; and the answer   came "Because you differ from us  in religion. You preach the gifts,  graces, and revelations of Jesus  Christ today as taught in ancient  days, and we do not believe in them.  Those things were taught in the dark   ages to convince the children of   men of the work of God. We now  live in the glorious Gospel light, and   we do not need them." That was  the kind of teaching by ministers in  the present day; but he (the speak-  er) would say in answer to this:  "Then, for God's sake, give me the  dark ages of the world."    He did not believe there ever  lived a people either in this or any  other generation, who had been  more lied about than the Latter-day  Saints. It was astonishing how  little these "Mormons," as they   were called, were known in the   world. Strangers who came into  this city would sometimes enquire  of a man whom they saw standing  in the street—and who had probab-  ly made up his mind enough to lie  about them—something about  the "Mormons," and they learned  from him in five minutes all about  "Mormonism." These people re-  turned home and told what they  had learned, and the story spread  until the truth was hardly ever  heard. It had been asserted here in  years gone by, as a reproach against  the Latter-day Saints, that not a  man or woman could send a letter  anywhere out of the Territory  without the Presidency of the   Church first reading it. Such state-  ments were of course false. Why,  he had scarcely time to read his   own letters when written, much   less those of the many thousands of   people who dwell here. There was  just as much truth in that as in the   statement that the Presidency told  every Latter-day Saint how to vote.   He had resided in this valley some  forty-four years, and he could safely  say that during the whole of that  time, so far as he could recollect,  he had never told any man or  woman how to vote. If he had told   anyone, it had only been some of  his own boys who might have  asked his advice; but he did not re-  member even that.    Falsehood had been spread over   the whole world to such an extent  that the people hardly knew what  to believe in regard to the Latter  day Saints. Some persons had ac-  tually entertained the idea that the   "Mormons" had horns! The speaker   recited an incident bearing on this  absurd fallacy. On one occasion, he  said, a few Gentile gentlemen got  into the company of a young "Mor-  mon" Elder for the first time. He  was a good-looking, bright, and in-  telligent young fellow, and they  were somewhat surprised to find  that he was like other men. They  all wore their hats at the  time, and one of the company de-  sired the Elder to remove his from   his head. He at once complied with  the request, remarking, however, as  he did so, "You see I am young  and my horns have not begun to  grow yet."    President Woodruff related an-  other circumstance within his ex-  perience. Some years ago he traveled  from Ogden with a party of clergy-  men. Upon their arival here, and  on passing the Sixteenth Ward  schoolhouse, one of the number  inquired what that building was used   for. On being informed, the ques-  tioner expressed his astonishment,  remarking that he had no idea the  "Mormons" had schools!    The world was opposed to the  Latter-day Saints on almost every  ground; and as to revelation, it was  one of the worst things a man could  believe in if he wished to be popular  with the multitude outside.    He urged the Latter-day Saints  to exercise faith in God, to believe  in Him and in His Son Jesus Christ  as the Savior of the world. If they  were not united they were not the  people of God. Let them live true  to their religion, looking forward to   the promises which God had made  unto them, and which He would  assuredly fulfil if they walked in the  ways of righteousness.

 SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 20, 1888.    To the Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.:    DEAR BRETHREN. At the late con-  ference of the Y.M.M.I.A., much   instruction was given, relating to the   organization and government of the   Associations, which you no doubt heard  or have since read. Pursuant to these   instructions and with a view to harmo-  nizing the labors of all officers and   members during the approaching sea-  son, we feel it opportune to direct your   attention to some points that are de-  serving your especial consideration. In   the first place, we would like the officers  to read the lectures and addresses that   were delivered at the conference. (They   can be found complete in the June and   July numbers of THE CONTRIBUTOR.)   If you carefully read and reflect upon  these, you will better understand the   import of this communication.    As soon after the October conference   as convenient, it is expected that the   officers of each Association will get to-  gether in council, arrange for the time of   holding meetings and call the members  of their respective Associations together.    At the first meeting the old roll will be   called, and the names of those who   answer present entered as the com-  mencement of the new roll for the year.    Other names will be entered as they   come in at subsequent meetings. The   present officers will continue in office   until such time as appointments are   made by the Stake Superintendency, for   the annual election in each Asssociation   when others may be chosen, if a change   is thought desirable. At your first meet-  ings you should lay before the Associa- 
 Hon. Lorenzo Snow, and the   Members of the Legislative  Council.    GENTLEMEN: Your Committee,   to whom were referred the petition  of Joseph F. Nounnan, Clerk of the  District Court for the Third Judicial   District, asking for an appropria-  tion to provide a safe place in   which to keep the Records of said  Court, and accompanying said peti-  tion the resolution of your Honor-  able Body that the sum of $2,500  be incorporated in the General Ap-  propriation Bill for the purpose as  set forth in said petition; and the  petition of E. Gordon Woolley, As-  sessor and Collector of Washing-  ton County for the year 1871, ask-  ing for the appropriation of the   sum of $7.25; and the Resolution of  your Honorable Body, that your   Committee should consider the  propriety of appropriating the sum   of $2,500 for the purpose of improv-  ing the road from Utah County to  Sanpete County, via Spanish Fork   Canyon and Thistle Valley, have   considered them and report as fol-  lows:    On the petition of J. F. Nounnan,  we recommend that the sum of   $3,000 be appropriated, or so much  thereof as may be necessary, and   expended by the Auditor of Public   Accounts, in the purchase of Four  Safes, one each for the First and   Second Judicial Districts, and Two   for the Third.    On the petition of E. Gordon  Woolley, that the sum of $7.25 be   appropriated.    In the matter of the road from   Utah County to Sanpete County,  via Spanish Fork Canyon, and  Thistle Valley, we report adversely.    We recommend that the sums  above mentioned $3,000 and $7.25.  be incorporated in the Territorial  Appropriation Bill.    W. WOODRUFF,  Chairman of Committe on   Claims and Appropriations.  Feb. 10th, 1874.

Lorenzo Snow, President,  and Members of the Legislative  Council:    Gentlemen—Your Committee, to  whom were referred the Territorial  Marshal's Account,and the account  present against the Territory in   favor of Wm. Brown, Sheriff of  Weber County, and deputies, re-  port with regard to the former and   recommend the appropriation of  $4,165.51 to cover the amount ap-  proved and issued by the Auditor  of Public Accounts in excess of the  amount of $10,000 appropriated at  the last session.

 THE DESERET NEWS.    TRUTH AND LIBERTY.    NO. 1. GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1863. VOL. XIII.    REMARKS  By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF. Great  Salt Lake City Bowery, June 12 1863.    REPORTED BY G. D. WATT.    Jesus said to those whom he had appointed  to go forth and preach his Gospel; "Go your  way: behold, I send you forth as lambs among  wolves. Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor  shoes: and salute no man by the way."— [##Luke 10:3-4##]  Again, "And ye shall be brought before gov-  enors and kings for my sake, for a testimony  against them and the Gentiles. But when  they deliver you up, take no thought how or  what you shall speak, for it shall be given  you in that same hour what you shall speak.  For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of  your Father which speaks in you." [##Matthew 10:18-20##]    This is one of the blessings that belong to  the church and kingdom of God in this and  in every other age of the world when God has  had a church upon the earth. When people  attempt to preach the Gospel without the in-  spiration of the Holy Ghost, they are under  the necessity of studying or of writing their  sermons, thus presenting the cogitations of  their own hearts in support of the doctrines  and tenets of their particular sects. When  the Lord sets to his hand to perform a work,  and to build up his kingdom on the earth, his  servants whom he calls to do this work are  obliged to trust in the Lord their God and to   lean upon his arm for strenth, for no man  can tell what the will of God is unless it is  revealed to him by the revelations of Jesus  Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost.    This is the principle that has sustained the  Elders of Israel, in our own day, in all their  labors among the nations to build up this  kingdom for the last time, and to preach the  Gospel in the ears of all people and nations.  The servants of God in Zion, in all their coun-  sels and deliberations for the promotion of   holy and righteous principles, have to be con-  stantly governed by it. Had it not been for  this principle, this congregation, gathered  from almost every nation under heaven,  would not have been found here to-day; we  might have preached to them until dooms day  and we, of ourselves, by our own wisdom and  ability, could never have convinced them of  the truth of the gospel the Lord has revealed  in our day, for the gathering and salvation of  the honest in heart, and for the establishment  of righthousness over the whole earth.    Not only the men who bare record of these  things had the testimony of Jesus Christ, but  it also reached those who heard their words  bearing record of the truth to every honest  hearted person thoughout all the world for  the last thirty years. We cannot know the  hearts of men, nor the will of God concerning  nations, kingdoms, and people only as it is  revealed to us by the gift and power of the  Holy Ghost. President Young reproves, cor-  rects, gives revelation and teaches doctrine  and principle, for the benefit of this people  and mankind in general by the revelations  which God gives to him. This principle in-  spired the hearts of ancient prophets and ser-  vants of God and sustained them in every try-  ing scene, it has also been the comfort and  sustaining power of the servants of God in  this last dispensation from the foundation of   this kingdom to the present time. As the  ancient apostles were called so have the  modern apostles and servants of God been  called to go into all the world, and preach the   Gospel to every creature, and the gift and  power of the Holy Ghost has sustained them  when they were brought before kinds and ru-  lers. The Savior preached and traveled, and  suffered until he gave up the ghost on Calva-  ry; that same power sustained him under ev-  ery circumstance, and made known unto him  the will of his Father. This is one among  the many blessing which the Latter-Day  Saints enjoy. God reveals unto us light and  truth and brings to our remembrance things  which are according to the will of God which  we should teach. This is a great consolation  to us, and to realize our position in the moun-  tains. We have been led here by the gentle   hand of God. No man could have foreseen  what would happen to the nation of the Uni-  ted States had it not been revealed to us in  the revelations which God gave to his proph-  et Joseph Smith. The revelations concerning  what shall transpire in the last days can be  read in the Book of Mormon, Book of Doc-  trine and Covenants, and in the Bible. "Sure-  ly the Lod God will do nothing, but he re-  vealeth his secret unto his servants the proph-  ets." [##Amos 3:7##] When we were called upon to leave  our homes and our holy temple in Nauvoo, it  was a great trial to many. When we came  to this country as pioneers, we built the bridg-  es, killed the snakes, and opened the way for  the emigration of saint and sinner, saying,  it is all right; but we did not know how soon  the calamities that are now upon the nation  would break forth, yet we knew they would   come soon. By what power did we influence  these men and women before me to leave their  homes and their country to dwell in these  distant wilds? They were influenced by the  inspriations of the Almighty which always   attends the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ in all ages. There was a spirit in   them, and the inspiration of the Almighty  gave it understanding, and they were moved  upon to listen to the advice that the servants  of God gave them, to gather to the place the  Lord had appointed to locate his people—  This is the hand of God, and we should be  thankful for this good land and for our homes.  We here dwell in peace, and s[t]and in holy  places, in a land which has been dedicated to   God; and the power of righteousness prevails  here, and hence we have power to remain  here in peace. We remain here in peace be-  cause righteousness and the power of God  dwell here. It is true the enemy of God and  all the righteous, the devil, who goes about  like a roaring lion seeking whom he may de-  vour, has sought our destruction from the be-  ginning, and has stirred up the wicked to seek  our overthrow; yet the Lord has preserved us;  we should be thankful for this, and we should  honor God and worship him with undivided  hearts, doing our duty constantly, and pursu-  ing that course wherein we shall be justified  before the Lord.    No man can value sufficiently the life he   now holds, and the place he now occupies in  this world, unless he is moved upon by the  Spirit and power of God to enlighten his un-  derstanding. What is the chief end of man?  It, seemingly, is to get gold and fame, and the  honor that man bestows, to gratify their sen-  sual propensitites and desires. Do the great  mass of mankind seek to honor and glorify  God, seeking by every lawful means to bring  their bodies into subjection to the law of  Christ? Do they understand that they are  the offspring of God, and are made after his  image and likeness, and placed in this world  to pass through a short probation to prepare  them to dwell eternally in the presence of the   Father and the Son? Are not nine tenths of  the human family more ready to blaspheme  the name of God than to honor it? Would  they do this if they were in possession of the  Spirit of God to magnify their calling and  fulfill the object and end of their creation?—  No. Every thing that God has made keeps  the law of its creation and honors it except  man. I have always marveled at this. Man-  kind, who are made after the image of God to  answer a high and noble purposes are the only  beings in creation that will blaspheme his  name and set at naught his authority. They  have an agency, and the Spirit of God is of-  fered to them as freely as the light of the  sun, which shines on the just and on the un-  just, if they would receive it. All the light  and intelligence man ever did or will have,  has come through that principle and power,  and in company with this, the Lord has rais-  ed up men in our own generation, to whom he  has sent the administration of angels, and  laid on them the responsibility of bearing   record to the gospel, with a promise to all  nations, both Jew and Gentile, that, if they  will receive the testimony of his servants  they shall receive the Holy Ghost who shall  bear record unto them of the truth. Have the  nations received the Gospel? Yes, one of a  family and two of a city, here and there one,  and they are gathered together to stand in  holy places and to build up the church and  kingdom of God in the last days, to prepare  the way for the coming of the Son of Man.—  The mass of this generation have rejected the  Gospel; they have shed the blood of the Lord's  prophets and consented thereto, and have  driven from their midst those who bear the  words of eternal life. One of the most liber-  al and free Governments under the heavens  has driven out from them the only people un-  der the heavens that God acknowledges as  his church, because of the word of God and  the testimony of Jesus which they bear. We  have been driven to the valleys of these moun-  tains for our good; the hand of God has led us  here. Great affliction awaits the nation from  which we have been driven out, and the wick-  ed nations of the Gentiles on this land and in  foreign lands.    We live in a momentous age, and our re-  ponsibilies are great before the Lord, and to  this generation. We have borne record of the  calamities that should be poured out in the  last days and they are coming to pass. For  thus saith the Lord, "and after your testimo-  ny cometh wrath and indignation upon the  people; for after your testimony cometh the  testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause  groanings in the midst of her, and men shall  fall on the ground and not be able to stand,  and also cometh the testimony of the voice of  thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and  the voice of tempests, and the voice of the  waves of the sea, heaving themselves beyond  their bounds. And all things shall be in  commotion; and surely men's hearts shall fail  them; for fear shall come upon all people; and  angels shall fly through the midst of heaven,  crying with a loud voice; sounding the trump  of God, saying, prepare ye, prepare ye, O in-  habitants of the earth; for the judgment of   our God is come: behold, and lo! the Bride-  groom cometh, go yet out to meet him." [##Doctrine and Covenants 88:88-92##] Again,  "I the Lord am angry with the wicked; I am  holding my Spirit from the inhabitants of the   earth. I have sworn in my wrath and de-  creed wars upon the face of the earth, and  the wicked shall slay the wicked," [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:32-33##] etc.    If a thousand prophets had proclaimed to  this nation what has come to pass since 1860  to the present time, who would have believed  them? Not a man unless they possessed the  spirit of revelation. What the prophet Joseph  Smith foretold thirty years ago is now come  to pass; and who can help it? Have the Lat-  ter Day Saints been the cause of this dreadful   war? No. While Joseph Smith was living  every public and private calamity that hap-  pened in the land was laid to his account. It  is not Joseph Smith or his brethren that doeth  these things, but the Lord has laid his hand  on the nation. It is a consolation to the  Saints when they contemplate upon what God  has spoked through his servants which is  now being fulfilled before their eyes. All  that has been spoken by ancient and modern  prophets have had their fulfillment until now,  and will have the scene is wound up.    No man ever did or ever will obtain salva-  tion only thorugh the ordinances of the gospel,  and through the name of Jesus. There can  be no change in the gospel; all men that are  saved from Adam to in[fi]nitum are saved by  the one system of salvation. The Lord may  give many laws, and many commandments to  suit the varied circumstances and conditions  of his children throughout the world, such as  giving a law of carnal commandments to  Israel, but the laws and principles of the  gospel do not change. If any portion of this  generation is saved it will be because they  receive the gospel which Jesus Christ and his  apostles preached. When the Lord inspires  men and sends them to any generation, he  holds that generation responsible for the  manner in which they receive the testimony  of his servants. He called upon us and we  left our occupation, to go forth in our weak-  ness to preach his gospel; we had no power in  and of ourselves to do this only as the Lord  gave us strength by his Spirit; and we have so  far built up his kingdom upon this principle;  we have been governed by this principle of  revelation in all our public and private works  which we have done for God. We shall build  our temple upon this principle, and carry out  all the purposes of the Lord our God in the  latter days upon the same same principle and upon  no other.    The very moment that men undertake to   move for God in their own way and upon  the principles of their own coining, they will fail  to accomplish that which they design. The  world has tried this for generations. It is now  almost universally acknowledged throughout  christendom that no man is properly qualified  to preach the gospel unless he has passed  through a college, or some insitution of learn-  ing to study the theology and get a knowledge of  Greek, Latin and Hebrew—of languages dead  and living. Does this system of learning  alone give power to administer salvation to  mankind? Does it give evidence and bear  witness to the hearts of men by the power of  the Holy Ghost and the revelations of Jesus  Christ? It does not. The disciples of Christ  anciently were illiterate men, yet they bore  record to the learned that God had sent them  with a message of salvation. Jesus Christ,  whose life was a scene of affliction and sor-  row, who apparently had arose from the lower  grades of society, was eminently endowed  with the spirit and power of revelation from  his Father, and bore record of his works to  Jew and Gentile under its influence and power.    The servants of God in every age have  always been govered by the same power; and  we must build up the kingdom of God by it or  not at all. We look to him for guidance in  what we shall do from day to day; we have  been guided in this way hitherto and shall be  so guided unto the end.    I thank God that we have embraced a  gospel that has power in it; that we have the  true organization of the church and kingdom  of God, with its Apostles, Prophets, Pastors  and Teachers, gifts, graces and blessings for  the work of the ministry and the edifying of  the body of Christ. The moment any of the  helps, governments, gifts and powers are done  away from the church militant, schism is  created in the body and it no longer can co-  operate with the church triumphant in heaven  against the power of the devil and wicked  men. We cannot build up the kingdom of  God in our day and overcome the powers of  evil which prevail over the world without  inspired prophets and apostles, gifts, powers  and blessings, any more than they could in  the days of Jesus and his apostles. We have  this church organization and the power which  attended it in ancient days, and we seek con-  stantly the welfare of the children of men.    We have a great work laid upon us, and we  are responsible to God for the manner in  which we make use of these blessings. The  Lord requires of us to build up Zion, to gather  the honest in heart, restore Israel to their  blessings, redeem the earth from the power of  the devil, establish universal peace and pre-  pare a kingdom and a people for the coming  and reign of the Messiah. When we do all  we can to forward and accomplish this work  then are we justified. This is the work of our  lives, and it makes life of some consequence  to us. When men are destitute of the Spirit  of God they do not prize life only to indulge  the cravings of unenlightened and perverted  human nature; they cross each other's in-  terests, become filled with the spirit of wrath  and indignation, and thirst for and shed the  blood of each other. Would they do this if  they were inspired by the spirit and power of  God? No. That which is good is of God, and  that which is evil emanates from the devil.    The Lord permits judgments to come upon   the wicked, but he never sends a great calam-  ity upon the world without first sending  prophets and inspired men to warn the wicked  of approaching chastisement, giving them, at  the same time, space for repentence and  means of escape, as witness the time of Noah,  Lot, etc. And, "as it was in the days of  Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming  of the Son of Man." [##Matthew 24:37##] When the messengers  of God have given a faithful warning to the  wicked of their approaching overthrow, and  the testimony is sealed, then will the Lord  come out of his hiding place and vex them  with a sore vexation. All that the Savior  said should come upon the wicked Jews was  literally fulfilled, and his blood is now upon  them and their children. The hand of God  has been zealous in holding the Jews under  the ro[d] until this day. Why? Because they  rejected the testimony of the Son of God, and  his gospel. That is the cause of the great  trouble to-day that is vexing this nation and  other nations in the old world. You may put  all the judgments of God together that has  befalled the nations and tribes of men from  the beginning, and the afflictions they suffered  are no greater than are now ready to be   poured out upon the gentile world.    John the revelator saw this day. He saw  also "an Angel of God fly in the midst of  heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach  unto them that dwell on the earth, and to  every nations, and kindred, and tongue, and  people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God,  and give glory to him; for the hour of his  judgement is come; and worship him that made  heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the foun-  tains of waters." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] That angel has delivered  his message and thousands of Elders of this  church have been called to this ministry; it  has been laid upon our shoulders. I have  traveled more than a hundred thousand miles  in the last thirty years to preach this gospel,  and many thousands of it with my napsack  upon my back, and without purse or scrip,  begging my bread from door to door to preach  the gospel to my own nation. Thirty years  ago it was said unto us. You hear of wa[r]s in  foreign countries, but you do not know the  hearts of men in your own land, for you shall  soon have greater wars in your own land, etc.    How is it my friends, is there trouble in the   eastern countries? What means this crowd-  ing of our streets with emigrants to the west?  The Lord God has spoken through his  prophet; his words have been recorded, and he  is backing up the testimony of his servants is  fulfillment of his word; and the end is not yet.  War and distress of nations has only just  commenced, and famine and pestilence will  follow on the heels of war, and there will be  great mourning, and weeping, and lamenta-  tions in the land, and no power can stay the  work of desolation and utter overthrow of the  wicked.    More than twenty-five years ago I wrote a  revelation which Joseph Smith gave, wherein  he said that the rebellion should commence at   South Carolina and from that war should  spread through this nation and continue to  spread until war should be poured out upon  all nations, and great calamity and distruc-  tion should await them.    I published the book of Doctrine and Cov-  enants in England in 1845 and since that  time it has been published in many different  languages, and thus we are sending the revela-  tions which Jesus Christ has given to his peo-  ple in the last days to the different nations  and tongues, that they may be left without an   excuse. We know these things are coming,  and because of them we are here in Utah, and  the devil and the wicked do not like it. Every  evil principle and power is opposed to us and  our testimony. Do we not desire to do all men  good? We do; and in proof of this I only need  say that we have labored for many years in  poverty and hardships to carry salvation to   the nations. Some of the European nations  have closed their doors against us, and  in some of those nations we have preached  the gospel and gathered out many souls, and  thousands more will yet come like clouds and  like doves to the windows to join with us in  the enjoyment of the great blessings which  the kingdom of God offers to all people.    The highest object of man in this life should 
 tions the general outline of work pro-  posed for the season; and you will be  aided in doing this, by reference to the  conference lectures. The President and   his Counselors, constituting the pro-  gramme committee, should be prepared  at the first meeting to announce ap-  pointments for the next, so that no un-  necessary delay may occur. As a basis  for the earlier programmes, we suggest  that you draw from the subjective Scrip-  tural headings, published in the ninth  volume of THE CONTRIBUTOR. In the   November number of the Magazine,   subjective titles to Doctrinal, Historical,   Scientific and other subjects will be  given, from which you will make assign-  ments for brief lectures to be delivered   in your regular meetings.    We wish to impress upon you the im-  portance of thorough organization and   mutual effort, not only for the improve-  ment of those who voluntarily join with   you, but for the reformation of those   who are indifferent. This is your mis-  sion; to look after the young men of   your respective wards: and we wish it   understood that the counsel of the  Priesthood is that every young man in   Zion should join and take part in these  Associations. You will please see that   this message is delivered to as many as   possible. We hope that you will make  the influence of the Associations felt this   season, more than heretofore, in the   saving of the wayward. As officers,  you should feel an anxiety for the refor-  mation of such, and be found extending  the helping hand. The Associations are   also appealed to, to improve the tone of   our social parties, and to popularize the   observance of counsel as to the regula-  tions to be observed in them.    There is a great deal of lightminded-  ness and idle conversation indulged in  by our young men, which you can do   much to correct. Place the books of the  Mutual Improvement Association Course   o[f] Reading in the hands of as many of   the young men as you can get to take  them, and encourage conversation upon  the subjects they treat of. Especially we   would advise that you do not neglect the   crowds of young men and boys, who   loiter upon the streets or congregate   about the stores, the sunny sides of the   meeting houses, barns and other places  in the winter, and indulge in levity and   vulgar conversation. Try and break up   such gatherings, by persistently leading  into habits of reading, as many of their   number as you can influence. This   Course of Reading, which we have   adopted, is designed to help you in the   work of interesting and saving the young.    It should be taken up by every officer   and member and pursued faithfully to   the end. You can make this a great  success; but it will depend upon your   interest in it, as manifested by your   energy in advocating and example in   pursuing it. If you do not take these  books and read them you cannot expect   others to. We desire your prompt and   cheerful assistance to introduce this   Course of Reading, and rely upon your   support to maintain it.    We realize that the matters involve   the employment of your time and  means; but if you, the representative  young men of Zion, are not interested   in them, how do you expect that Zion   will be established? Our testimony is,   that the time has come for the young   men of Israel to give serious attention   to the reformation of their lives, and to   the improvement of their minds. The   Lord requires this, and as His servants,  we enjoin it upon you. We shall watch   with deep interest the work of the   Associations, during the coming season,   and shall take occasion to promote it, by   our counsel, as opportunity is presented.    Be energetic and faithful and the Lord  will be with you. We shall pray for  you continually that you may be pros-  pered and blessed, in the name of   Jesus.    Your Brethren and Fellow Laborers,    Wilford Woodruff,  Joseph F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher,    General Superintendency  Y.M.M.I.A. 
 ADDRESS OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTEN-  DENCY.    To the officers and members of the Young  Men's Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions throughout Zion:    DEAR BRETHREN—While regretting the  existence of circumstances depriving us  of the satisfaction and pleasure of ming-  ling personally with you, in your general   conference gathering, we are delighted  with the privilege of addressing you in  writing.    Our hearts are full of gratitude to our  heavenly Father, and we rejoice exceed-  ingly in the blessings of life and liberty  so abundantly bestowed upon the youth  of Zion. Upon you, dear young breth-  ren, the hope of Israel largely rests. Be 
 General Superintendent Wilford Wood-  ruff addressed the conference in sub-  stance as follows:    I have been suffering for some days   with a cold, which almost disables me  from public speaking, yet I will try to   make a few remarks upon this import-  ant occasion.  In my view there never  before was a time when all the powers   of heaven, earth and hell were working  in their respective spheres as they are   now for the advancement of the pur-  poses of God. The Lord has labored   from the creation to lead men to do good  and to obey such laws as would result   in good to mankind. Whatever leads to  good, we are told, is of God, and what-  ever leads to evil is of an opposite source.  As a people we understand somewhat  the nature of the warfare necessary in  the carrying on of this work. We can-  not expect any less opposition than has  been shown to the work of God in past   ages. There has always seemed to be a   determination on the part of the powers  of darkness to frustrate the purposes of   God. This has been especially the case   in this age. We know that God has   again revealed His will and established  His kingdom. John the Revelator fore-  told the flying of an angel through the   midst of heaven having the everlasting  gospel. Many declarations of Scrip-  ture point to the restoration of the gos-  pel in these the last days.    We have gathered in these valleys,  perhaps a hundred and seventy-five   thousand Saints from all parts of the  world, and from various occupations.  The weak things of the world have been  chosen to bear the Priesthood, and tes-  tify to the restoration of the gospel.  Those who have listened to and obeyed  their message have received the Holy   Ghost, and have been led to gather. If   this message had not been from God,   the people who embraced it would not  have gathered, and Utah would have   still been a barren desert. Since the  Saints gathered they have had the same   trials and temptations which the Saints   in all ages have had to contend with.   The hosts of evil spirits who were cast  down out of heaven, are warring against  the Saints and all good men.    We have different organizations of   our youth for their proper spiritual train-  ing. There are the Primaries, where   the little children are taught the truths  of the gospel; also the Sabbath schools,  which embrace sixty thousand children.  Thank God there are so many. From   these the youth progress and become  members of the Mutual Improvement  Associations.    I regard the work awaiting the youth  of this people as equal in importance to   that which ever lay before a class of  young men and women on earth. It  rests upon them to take the Kingdom of  God and bear it forth; to stand in the   midst of the judgments which are com-  ing upon the earth. I regard the pres-  ent generation as lying in as deep dark-  ness as any that ever lived upon the   earth. A thousand murders are com-  mitted now where there was one, seventy  or eighty years ago.    The Kingdom of God, its keys and  Priesthood, are here; and I want to say 
    To the Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Associations:    BELOVED BRETHREN: I have been  requested to give a brief outline of my  life and association with the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In  order for me to comply with such a re-  quest my communication must of neces-  sity be exceedingly brief, to be suit-  able for an article in a magazine like  the CONTRIBUTOR.    I was born March 1st, 1807. My  father's name was Aphek Woodruff. My  mother's name was Beulah Thompson.  She had three sons; Azmon, born  November 29th, 1802; Ozem Thompson,  born December 22nd, 1804; Wilford, born  March 1st, 1807. All three are living at  this date;* Azmon, at my farm house in  Farmer's Ward; Ozem Thompson, at  Daysville, Oswego County, New York;  but he is nearly blind. I am still living  in Salt Lake City. My mother died June  11th, 1808, at Avon, Connecticut, aged  twenty-six years, leaving me fifteen  months old. My father was a miller, as  was also his father before him, which  occupation I followed until 1832.    At an early age my mind was exercised  upon religion, although I did not make  any profession thereof until 1830. I did  not then join any church, for the reason  that I could not find any denomination  whose teachings, faith and practice  agreed with the ordinances and gifts of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by  Him in His day and time. Although the  ministers of the day taught that the  faith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordi-  nances which the ancient Saints enjoyed  were done away and were no longer  needed, I did not believe it to be true,  only as they were done away through   the unbelief of the children of men. I  believed the same gifts, graces, miracles  and power would be manifest in one age  of the world as in another, when God  had a Church upon the earth, and a  people who would obey His ordinances  as in ancient days. I believed the  Church of God would be re-established  upon the earth, and that I should live to  see it. These principles were riveted   upon my mind, from the perusal of the  Old and New Testament, and with fer-  vent prayer that the Lord would show   me what was right and what was wrong,  and lead me in the path of salvation  without any regard to the opinions of  men.    The whisperings of the Spirit of  the Lord for a space of three years  taught me that the Lord was about to  set up His Church and Kingdom in the  earth, in the last days, in fulfilment of  promises made by ancient prophets and  apostles who spoke as they were moved  upon by the inspiration of Almighty  God. While in this state of mind I went  with my brother Azmon to Richland,   Oswego County, New York. We bought  a farm and commenced business. In  December, 1833, two Mormon Elders,  viz. Zera Pulsipher and Elijah Cheney,  came into our town and stopped at our  house. Elder Pulsipher said he was  commanded by the Spirit of the Lord to  go into the north country, and he and  Elder Cheney had walked from Fabins  via Syracuse, near sixty miles through  deep snows, and our house was the first  place he felt impelled to stop at. He  appointed a meeting at the schoolhouse  which I attended, and on hearing him  preach I felt that his sermon was the first  gospel sermon I had ever heard in my  life. I invited these Elders home and  spent the night in conversation and in  reading the Book of Mormon. I was  thoroughly convinced it was a true rec-  ord of the word of God. My brother  Azmon and myself offered ourselves for  baptism, and on the thirty-first day of  December, 1833, Elder Pulsipher went  with us to the creek and baptized us,  with two other persons, we being the  first baptized in Oswego County; eight    *Since this paper was written, my brother  Azmon, departed this life, at my farm house, on  Monday, the fourteenth of January, 1889, at  10:26 o'clock p.m., aged eighty-six years, one  month and fifteen days. The funeral services  were held at the Farmer's Ward Meeting House,  at 11 o'clock a.m., Wednesday, January 16th,  after which, his mortal remains were consigned  to the tomb.—W. W. 
 ye, therefore, worthy of your holy call-  ing. Trust in the Lord of Hosts, give  your hearts to God, and fail not in your  mission of Improvement. Be watchful,  prayerful, obedient; for the eyes of  heavenly hosts are upon you. Honor  your parents, that your days may be  many. Venerate those grown gray in  the service of the God of heaven and  earth, and the ordinances of the Gospel  shall be your portion, the salvation of  God your part, and the Holy Priesthood  with the powers thereof your inherit-  ance. A great work is before you.  Thrust in your sickles and reap, for the  harvest is ripe, though laborers are few.  Be not satisfied, rest not content until  every young man professing the name of  Saint in Zion is enrolled in the cause of  Mutual Improvement.    Civilization, so called, with a tide of  evil and corrupting influences is sweep-  ing the land with temptations calculated  to lead the young into paths of vice and  destruction. These must be resisted  and overcome, because at war with peace  and purity. Be ye lovers of men rather  than lovers of pleasure. Using wisely  the gifts and graces with which the Al-  mighty has endowed you, rescue from  the allurements of saloons, beer halls  and other haunts of vice, those whom  God has designed should move on a  higher and purer moral plane.    Human redemption, from the effects  of the fall, is the grandest work in which  God and man can be engaged. Those  who would be successfully employed in  it must secure the testimony of the Holy  Spirit, make virtue the jewel of the soul,  purity of thought the guide of the heart,  and honor, integrity and truth com-  panions of daily life.    Conforming your exercises to the or-  ganizations of the Church, let all your  teachings harmonize therewith; so shall  all your works, under the proper use of  the Priesthood which you bear, be  sanctified to the honor and glory of God.  The general authorities of the Church  and those of the Wards and Stakes  throughout Zion will give you encourage-  ment and help whenever and wherever  needed.    Half-yearly conferences of the various  Young Men's Mutual Improvement As-  sociations may be held in the Stakes  throughout Zion at such times and places  as may be determined by the Stake  Presidency and Superintendency of the  Associations. These conferences may  occupy two days, including one Sunday,  and should be made occasions for re-  ceiving reports and giving mutual in-  structions that will tend to harmonize the  manner of conducting the Associations  and achieving the most satisfactory re-  sults.    A general conference of the Associa-  tions will be held about the first of June,  1888, and annually thereafter, the exact  date and place to be hereafter named by  the General Superintendency. The  Associations should endeavor to con-  tinue their regular weekly meetings  until about the time of the Annual Con-  ference, before taking their summer va-  cation. At the general conference statis-  tical and other necessary reports will be  required and time given for the consid-  eration of the best means and methods of  promoting the education and welfare of  the young men and women of Zion.    The Primary and Sunday School  organizations, Mutual Improvement Asso-  ciations, and Relief Societies have been  instituted for a wise purpose. They are  "helps and governments" calculated in  their nature and design to accomplish  much good among Saints. Each has  a special field of usefulness not occupied  by the others, and no man in this Church,  filled with the Holy Ghost, will lay a  straw in the way of either of them.  Neither will he find occasion for manifes-  tations of petty jealousies, by which to  foster one at the expense of another.    The Sunday Schools have gradually  and almost universally come to occupy  the forenoon of each Sabbath. Have  the interests of God's Church or the  welfare of His people suffered thereby?  Certainly not. What, indeed, is of more  vital importance to us than the proper  religious training of our children? What  the Primary Associations begin, let the  Sunday Schools and Mutual Improve-  ment Associations continue. Each has 
 EPISTLE OF THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCY.    To the Officers and Members of the  Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Associations throughout Zion.    DEAR BRETHREN: Once more, through  the blessings of the Lord, we are per-  mitted to address you in writing; and, in  doing so, we rejoice greatly in the bles-  sings of life and liberty with which you  are so abundantly surrounded on this  auspicious occasion. An appropriate  time has been chosen on which to hold  your first General Annual Conference,  for it is eminently befitting that the  young men of Israel should thus honor  the illustrious statesmen, colonizer and  Prophet Brigham Young, by holding  their conference meetings on a day so  near the anniversary of his birth. He  was inspired to organize the Mutual Im-  provement Associations throughout Zion.  With delight you can revere his memory;  for distrust of the young men of Israel   never marred his great mind. In them  he had unbounded confidence, and for  them unlimited love. The Almighty  endowed him with the faculty of reading  men more accurately and more thorough-  ly than most people read books. The  study of human hearts and the analyses   of human minds enabled him to distin-  guish between the good and the bad. By  the inspiration of the Holy Spirit frauds  stood rebuked, while sincere rejoiced  in his presence, and were comforted by  his love. Noting the yearly harvest  of death, and comprehending as few  men comprehend the magnitude of the  great work in which we are engaged, he  fully sensed the responsibility that must  ultimately rest upon you in bearing to a  victorious consummation the Church and  Kingdom of God.    The manner in which you have respond-  ed to his confidence and esteem has  produced the bloom preceding the  growth and ripening of glorious fruit.  Following in his counsels you will not  disappoint his anticipations, for you are  building upon a foundation resting upon  eternal principles. Continue faithful to  the covenants made with the Lord and  each other; give your hearts to God, and  listening ears to the counsels of His Holy  Priesthood, and when the storms beat  upon you and the house you are building  neither shall fall.    As your friends and brethren, we must  earnestly beseech you to avoid the snares  of worldly ambition. Enter not the gates  of pride, within which selfishness weaves  nets to bind the soul. Write upon them  the words inscribed over Dante's Inferno  —"Abandon hope all who enter here."  Thirst for the honors and praises of men  and undue love for the things of this  world are dangerous reefs, upon which  many have wrecked their hopes of eter-  nal life. Pride, wearing the garb of hu-  mility, often prays devoutly, preaches  eloquently; but dwellers in heaven are  as little children, of whom the youth of  Zion should be as an advanced class—  beautiful type of saintly humility and  unsuspicious innocence.    Haughty pride, insolent assumption  and over-reaching ambition come of him  who wrought rebellion in heaven, sowed  strife on earth, and trailed the serpent  through human hearts. Mocking infidel-  ity, atheistic boasts and sneering skep-  ticism are products of a power that reigns  in hell, because it would not serve in  heaven. Light and life, peace and puri-  ty, humility and homage, goodness and  grace, come of God. Misery and  mourning, pride and presumption, dark-  ness and death, come of Satan. Between  them, young men of Zion, you have  chosen well. Henceforth serve him who  made you, and heaven's light shall guide 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.    JUNIUS F. WELLS, EDITOR.    PUBLISHED BY THE CONTRIBUTOR COMPANY.  Terms: Two Dollars a Year, in advance.    SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL, 1887.    EPISTLE.  To the Young Men of Israel:    BELOVED Brethren in the New and  Everlasting Covenant: This being my  birthday, I having first seen the light of  day on Sunday, at ten o'clock, on the  morning of the first day of March, 1807,  making me eighty years of age this day, and  also having the honor of being appointed  by the Presidency of the Church as Super-  intendent of the Young Men's Mutual  Improvement Associations throughout  these mountatins of Israel—in view of  these circumstances, I feel that I am   authorized to give my brethren, the   young men of Israel, some counsel and  instruction. But I cannot satisfy my own  mind without the inspiration of the   Lord.    I have been a member of the Church  over fifty-three years. I held the office  of a Teacher one year, the office of a  Priest one year; the office of an Elder  one year; the office of a Seventy two  years; and have held the office of an  Apostle forty-eight years. I do not  speak of this boastingly, for when the  Lord chose me for an Apostle, one  passage of scripture was certainly ful-  filled—He chose one of the weak things  of the world.    I have traveled in the ministry during   this time, 145,000 miles, through England,  Scotland, Wales, six islands of the sea,  twenty-three of the United States, and  five Territories, including the Rocky  Mountains. I have crossed the Atlantic  Ocean four times, have held 4191 meet-  ings, and preached 3250 discourses.  Through my instrumentality the Lord  added to the Church in 1840, in the  south of England, one thousand eight  hundred souls, in eight months' labors,  among whom were nearly two hundred  preachers of the various sects. Fifty  of the preachers belonged to the United  Brethren, who had broken off from the  Wesleyan Methodists. This society of  United Brethren numbered six hundred,  all of whom were baptized, except one  person. I baptized one thousand of  these one thousand eight hundred. The  others were baptized by Priests and   Elders whom I had ordained.    In my travels I have established  seventy-seven preaching places, organ-  ized fifty-one branches of the Church,  confirmed 3343 members of the Church,  ordained one Apostle, and united in  ordaining eight others. I have ordained  twenty-three Patriarchs, and assisted in  ordaining eighty-four others. I have   ordained ninety-three High Priests. I  have ordained twenty-four High Coun-  cilors, and assisted in ordaining seventy-  four others. I have ordained fifty-seven  Seventies, and six hundred and sixty-  seven Elders, and assisted in ordaining  four thousand three hundred and forty-  seven Elders. I have ordained twenty-  three Bishops and seventeen counselors  to Bishops. I have ordained four hun-  dred and forty-six Priests, sixty-six  Teachers, and fifteen Deacons. I have  set apart and blessed one thousand and  thirty-four missionaries and assisted in   setting apart four thousand five hundred  and twelve other missionaries. I have  blessed several hundred children. I have  administed to one thousand one hun-  dred and fifty sick persons by the laying  on of hands and anointing with oil;  rebuking diseases and evil spirits in the  name of Jesus Christ; and many have  been healed by the power of God, devils  have been cast out, the dumb caused to  speak, the deaf to hear and the lame to  walk, and the sick have been raised up  by the power of God and not of man.    I have kept a daily journal for fifty-  three years, and reported many of   Joseph Smith's sermons and prophecies,  also many sermons of the Apostles and  Elders, and kept a general account of  events as they have occurred around me.  Through the blessing of God I have had  the privilege of baptizing my father,  step-mother, and only sister, with many 
 To the Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.:    DEAR BRETHREN: We have on hand  over one thousand sets of the M.I.A.  First Year's Course of Reading, and  desire your co-operation in placing them,  as soon as possible, in the hands of the  members of our Associations, with nec-  essary instructions as to their proper use.    The set of books, consist of the follow-  ing:    I. The Gospel, by B. H. Roberts;    II. The First Book of Nature, by J. E.  Talmage;    III. The History of England, by Chas.  Dickens;    IV. The Life of Nephi, by Geo. Q.  Cannon;    V. Readings from Washington Irving;    These books we consider extremely valu-  able to our young men; and the habit of  systematic reading, which they are ex-  pected to introduce, will be of the ut-  most benefit to all who engage in it.    We have appointed Elder Milton H.  Hardy to represent us, in presenting the  merits of the Course of Reading to you,  in connection with other instructions per-  taining to the work of mutual improve-  ment; and we trust you will cheerfully  assist him in his labors, so that all these  books may be put into the hands of  readers, during the present season; and  the young men, for whom they were pre-  pared, made the recipients of the great  benefits that are sure to follow their  careful perusal.    Your brethren,    (Signed)    Wilford Woodruff,  Jos. F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher,    General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A.  Nov. 14, 1890. 
 your feet in the path of purity, leading  to the gate of perfection.    From mountain heights pause ye now,  and gaze upon the world's magnificence,  pride and pomp; then trace the gleams  of light along the way in which faithful  Elders, prayerfully and earnestly, follow  the lowly Nazarene to realms of heaven-  ly glory. Note carefully the faith by  which they endure earthly tribulations,   in order to gain heavenly crowns. Pa-  tiently and faithfully do they bear their  message amid the scorn of mocking  mobs. Over lands and over seas they  carry the Gospel, seeking not to save  their lives lest they lose them. Taking  no heed of the morrow, they travel  without purse or scrip, trusting in God,  and receiving, as did their Master, the  contempt of the world. What shall be  their reward? Peace here, exaltation  hereafter! Ministers of Christ here, ru-  ling princes and reigning kings hereafter!  Lives eternal shall be their reward; for  thus do they come to know God the Fa-  ther and Jesus whom He hath sent.    In the midst of trials of tribulations,  while deathless woe oppresses the  heart, mothers may forget their nursing  babes, but He who notes the sparrow's  fall, will not forget His covenant chil-  dren, though in infinite wisdom, as a test  of faith, He permits pride to mock and  insolence to deride, while persecution  grinds and kills; but death and the grave  will be conquered, when the King of  Glory wins the ultimate victory at  the very gates of hell. Down into its  bowels did He descend, thence led cap-  tivity captive, and gave gifts to men.    Alone, while treading the wine-press  of the wrath of devils and men, gained  He the keys of death, hell and the grave.  They were forged in the crucible of in-  tense hate, not in the lap of luxurious  ease. Ingratitude heaped upon Him the  sins of the world, and heavy-eyed watch-  men slept while he prayed and sweat   great gouts of blood. Malice spat in his  face; Jealousy in mockery crowned him  with thorns; Envy mantled him with a  cast-off robe; Cruelty nailed Him to the   cross, then cried: "Come down, save  thyself." Son of God, Prince of Power,  commander of heavenly legions though  He was, the anguish of accumulated  woes, caused Him, as death's agony  bathed his brow, to exclaim: "My God,  my God, why has thou forsaken me?"    Ye sons of Zion, think of this, and  bear patiently the mocking scorn of un-  belief. Taunting skepticism may deride  your faith while sneeringly laughing at  your confidence in God. But remember  that the power to bear humiliation is  the test of humility. "There must needs  be offences, but woe unto them by whom  they come!" The exiled and imprisoned  may bear contempt; and while earthly  powers hold high carnival and mock at  sacred things, the promises of God may  seem to fail; but you who are wise will  know that the methods of Satan have  never changed. Pride, haughtiness, re-  bellion, oppression, deceit, rule and ruin  have ever been characteristic of the fallen  son of the morning. On the mountain  top he offered the Christ of God the  kingdoms of this world as the price of  false worship. Treachery lurked deep  when he sought to kill by tempting the  Lord to cast Himself down from the   Temple pinnacle; then sneeringly asked  that bread be made of stones to satisfy  hunger gnawing at famishing vitals. As  then, so now—Who lives godly in Jesus  Christ shall suffer persecution. 'Tis the  heritage of Saints. As they hated the  Master, so will they hate His servants.  Be not surprised, therefore, if for a time,  humiliation, contempt and scorn be your  part; for even while the hand of God  traced on the palace wall the doom of  the mocking king, the proud in drunken  revel defiled the sacred cups of the  Temple; but how quickly followed the  fall! Boasting Assyrian hosts, declaring  there was no God, reveled in sight of  the walls of Jerusalem; but the angel of  death passed over and wrapt them in  dreamless sleep, that knew no mortal  wakening.    Profit by these lessons of sacred his-  tory; trust the Lord, and place honor and  truth above the price of gold, and earth-  ly tribulations shall polish jewels that  God will set in frames of endless joy.  Permit not the illusive interests of this 
 to my young brethren who are present:   Lead your fellows from that which is   evil, and lay aside everything which   corrupts either mind or body. No man  can inherit a kingdom of glory without  abiding the law of that kingdom, and   we are all aiming, or should be, for a   celestial kingdom.    Nine out of ten of the young mis-  sionaries now being sent abroad, are  chosen from the Mutual Improvement  Associations. The members of these   organizations are preparing themselves  for the ministry. In company with some  of my brethren, I have the honor to be   associated with these institutions, but I   have not much time to spend with them.    In 1844 about seven thousand persons   were baptized in England; but now the   labors of our missionaries are like gath-  ering grapes after the vintage is done.   If an Elder, during a mission of two  or three years, baptizes half a dozen  or a dozen persons, he thinks he has  done a good work; and he has.    Young men, leave grog shops alone;  avoid everything that is evil; remember   that you have a law to obey and never   break it. Keep the law of purity and   chastity.    I pray God to help you to comprehend  your positions, duties and labors. I am  sometimes asked why does not God   preserve His Saints from persecution and  temptation? God has His own way to   deal with men. In no age has He kept  His people from contact with persecu-  tion and temptation. We have to meet   these things; therefore prepare your-  selves for them.    I ask God to bless you all, to guide  you and preserve you, in the name of  Jesus. Amen. 
 others were soon added to our numbers,  and on the second of January, 1834,  Elder Pulsipher organized a branch of  the Church with twelve members, and  ordained my brother Azmon and Noah  Holten Elders, and myself a Teacher.  This was the commencement of my asso-  ciation with the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.    From that day I have closely associated  with the leaders of the Church in all their  history, until the present day. I traveled  with Joseph Smith and company known  as Zion's Camp, from Kirtland to Clay  County, Missouri, upwards of one thous-  and miles. I wrote a good portion of  the history of that important event.  The experience gained in traveling with  the Prophet of God in the company of two  hundred and five, mostly young men,  was of great benefit to those who were  disposed to make a right use of their  experience. On my arrival in Clay  County I took up my abode at Lyman  Wight's, with Tilton Hyde, Milton  Holmes, Judge Elias Higbee and some  of the Whitmers. I attended the meet-  tings of the Prophet Joseph while he was  in Clay County, organizing the Presi-  dency of that Stake of Zion and appoint-  ing David Whitmer as President.    I was still holding the office of a Teach-  er, and knowing for myself that the ful-  ness of the Gospel of Christ, which God  had revealed to Joseph Smith, was true,  I had a great desire to preach it to the  inhabitants of the earth, but as a Teacher  I had no authority to preach the gospel  to the world. I went into the forest  near Lyman Wight's, one Sunday evening,  aside from the abodes of men, and made  my desire known unto the Lord. I  prayed that the Lord would open my  way and give me the privilege of preach-  ing the gospel. I did not make my re-  quest expecting any honor from man, for  I knew that the preaching of the gospel  was attended with hard labor and per-  secution. While I was praying, the  spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and  testified to me that my prayer was heard,  and that my request would be granted.  I arose to my feet and walked some three  hundred yards into a broad road rejoic-  ing. As I came into the road I saw Judge  Elias Higbee standing before me. As  I walked up to him he said, "Wilford,  the Lord has revealed to me that it is  your duty to go into the vineyard of the  Lord and preach the gospel." I told him  if that was the will of the Lord I was  ready to go. I did not tell him that I  had been praying for that privilege. I  had been boarding at Lyman Wight's  with Judge Higbee for months and it  was the first time he had ever named  such a thing to me.    At a meeting of the High Council at  Lyman Wight's, Clay County, Missouri,  November 5th, 1834, I was ordained a  Priest, by Elder Simeon Carter and Bishop  Edward Partridge appointed Elder  Henry Brown and myself a mission to  the Southern States. On the thirteenth  of January 1835, I received an honorable  discharge from Lyman Wight, as having   performed my duties faithfully in Zion's  Camp, and Elder Henry Brown and  myself started upon our mission. We  crossed into Jackson County and bowed  our knees upon that land and returned  thanks to the Lord, prayed for His pro-  tection from the hands of wicked men  and mobs, and went on our way re-  joicing. I started upon this my first  mission in life without purse or scrip  to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  We traveled through Jackson County,  living mostly upon parched corn until  we got out of the county. We spent  one night with Mr. Jerew, the Indian  trader, on the Osage river. The next  day we walked sixty miles and lay on  the floor of a house without anything to  eat, and walked next morning twelve miles  before getting breakfast, making  seventy-two miles travel without food.  We passed into Arkansas Territory and  spent several weeks at Petty John Creek,  where we passed through a very singu-  lar experience with Mr. Alexander Ake-  man and others, -[a full statement of  which is published in the eighteenth  number of Vol. eight of the Deseret  News.]- We cut down a cottonwood  tree, and in two days dug out a canoe  four feet wide and twelve feet long, and  rowed down the Arkansas river one 
 its mission and special field, upon which  no servant of God humbly trying to do  his duty will seek to encroach.    THE CONTRIBUTOR, as the organ of  the Mutual Improvement Associations, is  a medium of instruction and enlighten-  ment. How, except by judicious exer-  cises of the faculties shall we develop  the talent with which the Creator may  have endowed us? Few things, if any,  are calculated to strengthen the mind and  give it powers of concentration more than  the frequent use of the pen, in writing  for publication. And what agency is  more potent for good than the press?  THE CONTRIBUTOR, whose articles are  largely furnished by home authors, is a  magazine of which all Israel have reason  to be proud. Its circulation should be  widely extended, and to this end we in-  vite the co-operation of all Saints. The  editor, Brother Junius F. Wells, has been  singularly blessed in his management  of the magazine heretofore. His selec-  tion and arrangement of matter have  been remarkably fortunate, and the Lord  has been with him in his responsible  labors.    But, notwithstanding the degree of ex-  cellence reached, it should be our con-  stant effort to improve, and the young  men and women of talent among us can  do great service in this direction, by fur-  nishing regular contributions to the  magazine. To this desirable end we  very respectfully invite their hearty co-  operation.    Libraries and reading rooms should  be established throughout Zion, and  lectures on various subjects should be  encouraged. Thus may you become  acquainted with the customs, laws and  language of various countries, while  seeking to graduate in the science of all  other sciences—correct theology. In  this connection we would suggest that it  will be well in all the Stakes for the  Associations to take the initiative in es-  tablishing libraries and reading rooms.  This is a labor peculiarly adapted to our  organization and has been enjoined upon  us from the beginning. We deprecate  any disposition on the part of our young  men, especially those who have had  superior opportunities for acquiring an  education, to draw away from the Im-  provement Associations, and to form  among themselves separate societies of  an exclusive nature. Would it not be  better if they would lend their talent and   efforts to make the Improvement Associ-  ations more successful? There is no  worthy object they can desire to attain  that the Improvement Associations do  not contemplate and hope to reach. We,  therefore, ask the co-operation of all such  young men, and trust that it will be gladly  given, as we feel sure the results of a  united endeavor under proper organiza-  tion and direction will be most satisfac-  tory.    In all your struggles in acquiring  knowledge seek wisdom. In all your  efforts to improve seek to know God and  Jesus, whom He hath sent, for in that  knowledge is found life eternal. The  Holy Priesthood that you bear is the key  to unlock that door. See that you do  not misuse it and thereby fail. "Ask  and ye shall receive. Knock and it shall  open."    On returning home from this confer-  ence, we trust that you will carry with   you the Spirit thereof and renewed  determination to labor diligently and  earnestly for improvement in the interest  of purity and holiness. Remembering  always the reason for the hope within  you, make the love of God and of your  fellows the foundation of your work; and  moving forward steadily and prayerfully  and earnestly, you cannot fail in accom-  plishing that which brings peace, happi-  ness and salvation.    Praying that the Lord may bless, pre-  serve, guide and prosper you in all your  works of love, we remain,    Your fellow-laborers in the cause of  Mutual Improvement.    Wilford Woodruff,  Jos. F. Smith,   Moses Thatcher. 
 CIRCULAR.    To the Officers of the Y[.]M.M.I.A.:    DEAR BRETHREN. We desire to re-  mind you that the time for resuming   regular weekly meetings of the Associa-  tions has about arrived, and to urge the   officers to call the members of their   associations together early in October.    For the coming season we suggest and  recommend that the following subjects   constitute an important part of your   regular work. 
 other relatives, into the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have also  held the keys of the dead of my father's  house, and, through the mercy of God  and the assistance of my friends, I   have been enabled to redeem some  three thousand souls of the Woodruff,  Hart and Thompson families, through   the ordinances for the dead, for which I   feel to praise the Lord. For as Paul  says: Why are you baptized for the  dead, if the dead rise not at all?    Thus I have given you a few extracts  from my journal, which is only a limited  account of the labors of one man out of   thirty Apostles, one hundred and fifty  Patriarchs, some five hundred High  Priests, five thousand Seventies and  twenty thousand Elders, besides the  Lesser Priesthood, and two hundred  thousand members of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now,  with these reflections resting upon my  mind, and knowing that the work and  labor in the Church and Kingdom of  God will augment and increase from this  time forth with greater rapidity than it  has ever done, until the coming of the  Son of man, and thoroughly compre-  hending the fact that myself, with many  of the leading men and fathers in Israel  will soon pass to the other side of the   veil, my spirit is ready to cry out, "Where,  O where, O Lord, is the material which  thou hast ordained to step forth and  take our places and the places of the  fathers in Zion, to take the Church, the  Zion and Kingdom of God, and bear it  off triumphant, and prepare it as the  Bride, the Lamb's Wife, for the coming   of the great Bridegroom?" I will confess  that I know not where to look for this  element, if it is not to be found in the   young men who dwell in these moun-  tains of Israel. I am satisfied it can not  be found anywhere else upon the face of  the whole earth.    With this great fact and eternal truth  standing boldly before my face, what  can I say to my young friends, young   brothers, young men of Zion? You are  stepping forth into manhood as members  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. Many of you are already  bearing the holy Priesthood and officiat-  ing in its various offices. Many of you  have parents who have labored faithfully  to build up the Church and Kingdom of  God on the earth, and have finished   their testimony, and to-day are in the  spirit world. Many of you have parents   still living who will soon close their tes-  timony and also pass away. So far as I  am concerned, having reached my four  score years, I do not know that I shall  ever be permitted again in the flesh to  meet with the young men in Zion, in the  capacity of a mutual improvement asso-  ciation, or in their public assemblies.  So far as that is concerned, it mattereth  not. But I wish I had power to express   myself as I feel to the children, to the  young men and women of the Latter-  day Saints, who dwell in these moun-  tains. I wish the veil could be lifted  from off their eyes, that they could see  what lies before them, that they could  see their destiny, that they could see  unto what they are ordained. I wish,  my young friends, that you could com-  prehend the magnitude and value of the  great work which the God of Heaven is  about to place upon your shoulders.  Could the visions of your minds be   opened to see the great work your  Heavenly Father, the Father of your   spirits, ordained you to before the world   was, to enter into the flesh on the earth  in the last days, and take the Kingdom  of our God and bear it off triumphant,  and prepare it for the coming of the Son   of Man! I say, if you could see these  truths and comprehend them, you would  labor with all your might, mind and  strength to prepare yourselves and qual-  ify yourselves, not only with the Priest-  hood, but with the powers of that Priest-  hood and with the power of God, to  enter into the ministry and labor by  faith, that you may be able to stand true  and faithful to God and to your cove-  nants. For you stand on the earth in the  day when the judgments, wrath and in-  dignation of Almighty God are about to  be poured out upon the wicked of all   nations.    Jesus Christ is the light of the world,  the light that shineth in darkness, and 
 brief life to shut out the hopes of that to  come, nor quench the light that should  cheer even in affliction. Narrow not the  sources of comfort and happiness by  selfishly debasing godlike powers. Do  not hunger after perishable riches, but  help the needy, thus keeping open the  fountain of mercy, love and charity.  Shun, we beseech you, as you would the  deadly upas, the vulgarity of unseemly  struggles for place and power.    When Eli permitted his sons to asso-  ciate with harlots outside the Temple,  while they lived on the fruits of the  people's labor, the Lord spoke through  the boy Samuel and foretold what  should result. [##1 Samuel 2-3##] A few of our youth have  followed the example of Eli's sons.  Their course has been downward, and  they have trodden the path leading to  destruction. Among all your acquaint-  ances think of one who, having deserted  and turned away from the Lord, has  gained thereby peace, happiness or   greatness. Have they not, without ex-  ception, been as the moth that falls into  the burning blaze? Have not those  seeking the "liberty" of saloons, gamb-  ling dens and the companionship of the  unclean had their wings clipped in the  flames of a quenchless fire?    As you value happiness, peace and  joy, as you hope for salvation and exal-  tation, go not near the haunts of vice.  They allure only to destroy. Sound care-  fully the causes leading to infidelity and  doubt, note the actions of those who  slur the things of God, and you will find  that vice has stained the body and  blotted the soul. The Holy Spirit of  God dwells not in unclean tabernacles;  and he who sins and repents not, doubts;  and he who doubts is damned. Converse-  ly, to him that believeth the things of  God all things, whether in heaven, earth  or hell, will be made possible. Go not,   therefore, into the wilderness of sin to  lean upon broken reeds, but hold fast to  the "rod of iron" leading to the fruits  of eternal life. [##1 Nephi 8:19##] While earnestly seeking  for knowledge to be found in good  books, bear in mind the fact that the  Holy Ghost is the safest and most pro-  found instructor. He will bring to your  mind things past and present, and show  you things to come. Seek therefore his  constant fellowship, and his teachings  shall make you wise, good and great,  and finally lead you back into the pre-  sence of your Heavenly Father.    With all the accumulated wisdom,  knowledge and understanding of the  world, what did the people know of the  laws of God until Joseph, the boy pro-  phet, came? In the midst of the glare of  modern civilization and enlightenment  the Bible was as a sealed book. The  harmonies of the universe seemed con-  fusion, while professed ministers taught  the doom of everlasting damnation alike  for ignorant heathens and innocent chil-  dren, neither of whom had heard of  Christ. Holding their dupes over the  flames of an imaginative hell, they pro-  claimed the hideous doctrine of non-re-  demption beyond the grave. While  leading redhanded murderers, all drip-  ping in the blood of innocence, to the  hangman's scaffold and there promising  them, as they died, a free pass into the  bosom of the stainless Christ, they  preached the consignment of unbaptized  infants forever to the regions of the   damned!    Blind leaders of the blind, how could  they know God and His ways? How  could they measure His infinite love?  An earthly father, doing with his chil-  dren what they claimed God daily did  with his, would have been regarded, even  in the dark ages, as an unmitigated,  merciless tyrant. No wonder that such  dense ignorance should produce the soil  of skepticism, out of which has grown  infidel iconoclasts, whose intelligent  shrewdness plays upon the darkness of  such unholy doctrines, as electricity plays  upon the blackness of night. Under  their teachings the loving husband  and confiding wife parted forever at the  grave! How awful the thought indicated  in the mocking marriage ceremony pro-  claiming union only "until death do you  part." Were that all, then indeed would  this world and its brief joys be but a  delusion and a snare! But it is not all.  In heaven there are fathers and mothers  and children; husbands and wives eter- 
 hundred and thirty-five miles, to Little  Rock, begging our food by the way.  At Little Rock we took the military  road, having tied up our canoe, and  waded the great Mississippi swamp to  Memphis, Tenn., nearly one hundred  and seventy-five miles, most of the way  in mud and water knee deep. Brother  Brown took a steamer at Memphis and  returned to Kirtland, while I traveled  alone to middle Tennessee.    On my arrival at Memphis, I called  upon Mr. Jackson, who kept a public  house, and asked to stay over night.  When I said I was a preacher he ex-  pressed his belief that I was an impostor  and insisted that I should preach to a   congregation that he would gather to-  gether, and they should judge whether  I was a preacher or not. I spoke an  hour and a quarter to a crowded house,  and so many things were revealed con-  cerning themselves that I do not think  the same congregation will ever meet  again for the same purpose. I met with  Elders David Patten, and Warren Par-  rish, in middle Tennessee and labored  with them to the end of the year 1835.  Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder on  the twenty-eighth of June 1835. I was  ordained a Seventy and enrolled as a  member of the second quorum of Seven-  ties on the thirty-first day of May 1836,  by Elders David Patten and Warren  Parrish. I traveled and preached in  Tennessee from the twenty-seventh of  March 1835, until the twentieth of Sep-  tember 1836, at which time I was released  to return to Kirtland. I organized the  first company of Saints in the South to  go to Far West which numbered twenty-  two souls. While holding the office of  an Elder in Tennessee eleven months, I  traveled two thousand five hundred and  thirty-seven miles, held one hundred and  eighty-two meetings, baptized forty-  eight, ordained two Elders, two Priests,  three Teachers, eight Deacons and   blessed nineteen children. On the sec-  ond of October 1836, I started for Kirt-  land in company with A. O. Smoot and  Jesse Turpin, and arrived at Kirtland on  the twenty-fifth of October 1836, when I  had a happy meeting with the Prophet,  Apostles and Elders in the Temple of the   Lord. I spent the winter of 1836-7 in   Kirtland, and attended the school taught  by Prof. Haws, studying English and  Latin grammar. I was set apart as a   member of the first quorum of Seventies  on the third of January 1837. I attended  the meetings and received my washings  and anointings in the Kirtland Temple  in the spring of 1837. I then passed  through all the troubles and stirring  events of that period.    On the thirteenth of April, 1837, I was  joined in marriage with Miss Phebe W.  Carter, of Scarborough, Maine, at the  house of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The  ceremony was performed by President  Frederick G. Williams, and we were  blessed by the Patriarch, Father Joseph  Smith. Forty-eight days from this event,  on the thirty-first of May, I took the  parting hand of my wife and all my  friends in Kirtland and started upon a  mission to Fox Islands, in the Vine  Haven Bay, in the State of Maine. I was  accompanied by Elder Milton Holmes  and Jonathan H. Hale. On our journey  we crossed Lake Ontario and visited the  Saints, attended conference, administered  to the sick and evil spirits were subject  to us by the power of God. We continued  our journey, recrossed Lake Ontario and  visited Farmington, my native place, and  for the first time since I had joined the  Church visited my father's house. I  preached the Gospel to my relatives and  baptized my uncle Ozem Woodruff and  his wife Hannah and son John. This   was in fulfilment of a dream I had when  I was eight years old. On my return  from Fox Islands I baptized my father,  stepmother and only sister, also Dwight  Webster, a Methodist class leader, who  was boarding at my father's house. I  organized a small branch of the Church  of nine members, eight of whom were  my relatives. I preached to a large con-  gregation in the Methodist meeting  house at Farmington. My wife joined  me at Farmington and accompanied me  to Scarborough, Maine, and we visited  her father's house, it being my first visit.  I was kindly received.    On the nineteenth of August, 1837, I 
 OFFICE OF THE GENERAL SUPERIN-  TENDENCY OF THE Y.M.M.I.A.    Salt Lake City, Utah, March 17, 1891.    To the Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.    DEAR BRETHREN: At the approach-  ing April Conference, a meeting of the   Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A. will   be held for the purpose of giving instruc-  tions in relation to the work of the As-  sociations.

 THE COURSE OF READING. Two   years ago we attempted to introduce a  course of reading, designed for the enter-  tainment and instruction of our members   at their homes. The introduction of this  system for the purpose of forming correct   habits of reading we regarded as a very  important part of the work of Mutual  Improvement. While the success of the  introduction has not been all that we  hoped for it, we think it is because our   plan and purpose have not been fully ex-  plained. We shall undertake by letter   and missionary assistance to the several  stakes to make the value of this Course   of Reading known, and in the meantime   invite all the associations, which have not  done so, to make an effort to take it up  with as many members as possible.    TESTIMONIES. As one of the leading  objects of the associations is to secure  to their members testimonies of the   Truth, we suggest that exercises designed  to accomplish this be prescribed and in-  sisted upon in every association.    MUSIC—As a feature of great interest,   in all our meetings, vocal music claims  our attention. By the election of Prof.   Evan Stephens as Musical Director of   the associations, and the enterprise of   THE CONTRIBUTOR in publishing appro-  priate pieces and offering a number of   premiums for the best musical exercises  at our next annual conference, we trust   that good results will be obtained, and   hope that the associations will generally  make a special effort to work up this   feature of the exercises. We should like,   if possibe, to have a chorus from our   membership of five hundred voices to   take part in our conference next June.    BRIEF LECTURES—The practice of   speaking a few moments upon given sub-  jects is one that involves previous research  and reflection, and at the same time cul-  tivates force and concentration in thought  and speech that cannot fail to be of great   benefit to all who expect to devote a  part, at least, of their lives to public   speaking. The scriptural, scientific, his-  torical, and other subjects, which have   been published for the associations in   THE CONTRIBUTOR afford a wide range  from which programmes may be made.    AMUSEMENTS. We desire the Young   Men's Associations to co-operate with the  Associations of the Young Ladies in pro-  viding amusements for our young people.   There should be an improvement made   in the quality and social character of our  concerts and dancing parties, which we   believe these Associations are qualified   with the aid and direction of the Ward   officers to effect. We recommend that   the Associations arrange to give two or   three or more parties in their respective  wards during the coming season, that   shall be an improvement over any that  have ever been given before. Proper atten-  tion to this subject will enable us to inter-  est our young people and prevent them   seeking amusements under auspices that  are evil.    ORGANIZATION. The officers acting   last year are expected to continue in office  until their successors are chosen. At an   early meeting in October they should be  sustained for the ensuing season. If for  any cause changes are desirable, they   should be made at this meeting.    Regular weekly meetings should be  held, and we trust that nothing will be   permitted to interfere with them. We   certainly think that at least one evening  in the week should be devoted exclu-  sively to the work of mutual improve-  ment of our young men.    RECORDS AND REPORTS. Our partial  failure in the past to obtain full and cor-  rect reports we believe is due to the fail-  ure of the secretaries to keep full and  correct records. We would like to effect   a reformation in this respect and take   this occasion to request all our secretaries  to provide themselves, at the commence-  ment of the season, with suitable roll and   record books in which the names of   members may be enrolled and a faithful  record kept of the exercises rendered   during the season.    The stake and ward officers are   urgently requested to give diligent atten-  tion to these subjects and to take up the  season's labors for the welfare of our  young men with prayerful earnestness  and a determination to awaken and main-  tain interest in the associations which have   been organized under the inspiration of 
 the darkness comprehendeth it not.  Neither does this generation compre-  hend the work of the Latter-day Saints.  I do hope and pray that you, my young  brothers in the ministry, will call upon  the Lord in mighty prayer, that you may  be clothed upon by the power of God,  that you may be able to lead the way for  the rising generation in which you live  to walk in the path that leads to eternal  life and salvation, that you may have an  inheritance in the celestial kingdom of  God.    The great work the Lord has set His  hand to perform in the last days will not  stop. The Lord will not disappoint this   generation in the fulfillment of His  words, any more than He did in other  ages. Any person who is in the posses-  sion of the Spirit of God, sufficient to  discern the signs of the times, can see  clearly that the revelations of God in  the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc-  trine and Covenants are being fulfilled,  and they will all be fulfilled to the very  letter, and to the very end. The Chris-  tian Gentile world to-day are very fast  rejecting the Gospel of life and salvation,  sent unto them by the revelation of Jesus  Christ, through the administration of  angels in fulfillment of the revelations of  St. John. The present crusade against  the Saints in Utah, the late act of our  government in yielding to the public  clamor of the priest and the people, the  pulpit and the press, in passing laws to  take away the civil, religious and politi-  cal rights from two hundred thousand  Latter-day Saints because of their reli-  gion; and for the rulers of this great  republican government to trample under  their feet the most sacred principles of  the Constitution, to gratify the clamor of  our persecutors, is enough to pall the  heart of every reflecting mind through-  out the world. Would the rulers of our   nation have taken such a step against any  other people on earth, except against  the Church of Jesus Christ and the  kingdom of God on the earth? They  would not.    The God of Heaven established the  American government for a wise pur-  pose in Himself, and gave our fore-  fathers a glorious Constitution by inspira-  tion, the best Constitution ever given to   a human government, as a rich legacy to  be handed down to their posterity. Will  not that same God hold the rulers of the  nation responsible, who trample that Con-  stitution under their feet and break it in  pieces for the purpose of destroying a   people, who are seeking to build up the  Church and Kingdom of God on the  earth? He most assuredly will. Our  nation by these acts is turning the last   key that will seal its condemnation and  destruction. For the Lord has decreed  it in revelations ever given upon this  subject.    Now, my young brethren, I want to   say to you that you are about to step  forth upon the stage of action in the  beginning of the revolution, changes,  and judgments which are about to over-  whelm and engulf our nation and the  nations of the earth. You are bound to   take the offices, places and responsibili-  ties of those whose heads are blossomed  for the tomb and will soon pass away.  Therefore I am anxious for you, the  boys and young men in Zion, to see the  necessity of beginning immediately to  prepare yourselves for the work that lies  before you. You are the lawful heirs to  the Priesthood. The Lord has called and  ordained you to His work. You need  not heed the scoffs or ridicule of the  persecutors of the Saints. Their un-  belief will not make the truths of God of   none effect. The day is at hand when  the blasphemers will hold their lips.    My young brothers, you have no time  to lose or throw away. Solomon says  there is a time for all things. I think the  time has come when our young men  should call upon the Lord in prayer and  labor to obtain the Holy Ghost as their  constant companion, and seek out of the  best books, by study and by faith, to  treasure up knowledge, wisdom and  understanding. There is a day of mourn-  ing and lamentation approaching the  earth. I want the young people, as well  as their parents, to be prepared for it.  Yet the Lord will defend Zion and  establish His kingdom, and bring off  His Saints victorious. 
 ally bound together in the bands of love,  cemented by holy sacred covenants made  on earth.    What a flood of light, what a heaven  of joy, came from God through His un-  cultured boy prophet! Until he came,  this world seemed as a black wilderness  of woe, beyond which no heavenly light  appeared. As the sun lights from the  east to the west, so the revelations of  Almighty God have penetrated our  hearts and given us comprehension of  earthly and heavenly things. This, or a   future generation, will produce historians  whose delight it shall be to trace the  effects among God's children of the mar-  velous light brought in the world in our  day through the instrumentality of the  great modern revelator. It was indeed  a startling declaration to the world when  he fearlessly proclaimed that God again  had spoken from the heavens! Ignorance  stood amazed, while scoffing hypocrisy  raged; but the work of human redemp-  tion goes bravely on, while the meek   and poor and honest rejoice.    Upon you, dear young brethren, much  depends. Upon your shoulders the Al-  mighty is rolling responsibilities the  magnitude of which has never been ex-  ceeded in any age. The kingdom of God  revealed by Joseph will be given to no  other people. It will never fall. Be ye  therefore to its interest and advance-  ment faithful and true. Its government  is of heaven, and under it human liberty  and the rights of man shall blossom and  bloom into perfect fruit, for the Gospel  of Christ is a perfect law of liberty. Why  should any dread its sway? Christ is the  king, and has not He earned the right  to the dominion and rule of His own?  His kingdom is not autocratic, neither  wholly theocratic. It is indeed theo-dem-  ocratic—the voice of God and the  sanction of the people. Its laws rec-  ognize everywhere the doctrine of com-  mon consent. The Almighty in the  beginning gave to man the right to ex-  ercise his own agency. He will never  deprive him of that privilege, for by no  other means can he ever develop the  godhead within him. Those alone who  sell their bodies and barter their souls to  Satan will be in danger of binding them-  selves with chains too strong to be  broken by man's love of freedom or by  God's decree of human liberty.    He who fought the Christ of God in  heaven and was cast down to hell, still  forges chains with which to bind the  souls of men. From the beginning Luci-  fer was an ambitious tyrant and accuser  of his brethren. Heavenly hosts wept  when they saw the misery and woe he  would work for the inhabitants of earth.  But the final great struggle is fast ap-  proaching. Let us fear not the result, for  Christ and His people shall conquer   here, as He and they conquered there.  Pending the great final day of the Lord  Almighty, let it be your duty, young  men of Israel, to fast and pray, so that  "your bowels may be full of charity  towards all men, and to the household  of faith, that virtue may garnish thy  thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy con-  fidence wax strong in the presence of  God, and the doctrines of the Priesthood  shall distil upon thy soul as the dews of  heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy  constant companion, and thy sceptre an  unchanging sceptre of righteousness and  truth, and thy dominion shall be an  everlasting dominion, and without com-  pulsory means it shall flow unto thee,  for ever and ever."

 To the Officers and Members of the  Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Associations Throughout the World:    DEAR BRETHREN: Recognizing the  great importance of this organization,  and fully appreciating the efforts made by  those having the spirit of the work at   heart, and desiring most earnestly to  make continuous, in the spirit of its  planning, the effective work of mutual  education now in progress among our  people; and, furthermore, sensing the  magnitude of this educational force, and  knowing that membership is a blessing  and a privilege priceless in character,  although not yet fully valued and by 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.  JUNIUS F. WELLS, EDITOR.    SALT LAKE CITY, SEPTEMBER, 1891.    Y.M.M.I.A. MANUAL.    EARLY in September there will be is-  sued by the General Superintendency a   Manual or Reference Book for the  coming year's work in the Young Men's   Associations. It will be comprehensive   in its nature, will include many of the les-  sons heretofore published in THE CON-  TRIBUTOR and is designed to assist stake   superintendents and ward presidents in   carrying on in a uniform manner the   various Mutual Improvement organiza-  tions of the Church. The book will be   a necessary text-book for every officer   and will include names of general officers,   of stake superintendents, annual circu-  lar letter of General Superintendency,   instructions to superintendents, presidents   and members, diagrams, bibliography and   index, and a thorough course for one   year in theology, history, science and   literature. The plan for the year's course   is marked out in twenty-five lectures on  each of the subjects named. Under the   heading of theology appear lectures on  the Gospel with full analysis of B. H.   Roberts' work. Under history is given  lectures on the Bible, Book of Mormon,   New Testament, the Church, Cannon's   Life of Nephi, and England; Under   science, Talmage's First Book of Nature,   and civil government; under literature,   Readings from Irving, and references to   American literature generally.    The Manual is not merely an an-  nouncement of the year's work, but is   of itself educational in character and   if studied and properly used, will go far   towards placing every association organ-  ized in successful operation.    The annual letter of the General   Superintendency announcing the Manual   and the season's work is as follows:    To the Stake Officers of the Y.M.M.I.A.:    DEAR BRETHREN: In addressing our   annual letter to you, we take pleasure in  introducing this Manual which under our   appointment and direction has been   carefully compiled by Assistant General   Superintendent Milton H. Hardy, and   Stake Superintendent George H. Brim-  hall.    You will therefore make it a guide for   this year's work, and each one not only  become acquainted with, but practically  apply the specific instructions addressed  to him. In this way, your work being   systematic, will be more progressive and   successful than heretofore.    By reference to our former circular   letters, you will see the consistency   and necessity of our making the follow-  ing inquiries and suggestions:    How many of your Associations began   their regular weekly meetings early last   year, as suggested?    How many of your officers, stake and   ward, secured a set of, and became   acquainted with the contents of the first   year's series, M.I.A. Reading Course,   in order to be able to lead in that work   this year?    In how many of your Associations were  music classes organized and conducted   according to plan of general music direc-  tor, as given in the current numbers of    THE CONTRIBUTOR?    Have you in each ward of your stake   a Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Association?    Is your Stake Superintendency com-  plete?    Did you hold Stake Council meetings,  and prepare for the general work of the  stake, for stake officers' meetings, stake   conferences, your missionaries, your   public lectures, stake recreations, and  all other matters pertaining to the super-  intending of the work?    Did you hold stake officers' meetings?    Did you hold your half-yearly stake   conferences?    Did you visit officially each Associa-  tion in your stake twice last year.    Did you examine the records of each  Association in your stake last year?    Did you make any provision for public   lectures under auspices of the M.I A.   of your wards last year?    Is each Association working in har- 
 took the steamer Bangor, at Portland,  with Elder Hale and arrived at Owl's  Head at sunset, without any means to  continue our journey or get a meal of  victuals; we went on to a high hill and  bowed ourselves before the Lord, and  prayed that our way might be opened.  The spirit of the Lord rested upon us  and testified to us that our prayers would  be answered. As we arose from our  prayers, a sloop came sailing into the  harbor. We went to the captain and  enquired where he was going. He said  right through the channel to Vinal  Haven. He took us on board and  landed us on North Fox Island, at two  o'clock in the morning. We commenced  preaching in the Baptist meeting house  on the twentieth of August. Brother   Hale stayed with me one month and  twelve days. -[The history of this mis-  sion is published in full in No. 20, Vol.  8, Deseret News.]- Brother Hale started  for Kirtland October second; I accom-  panied him to Scarborough, and returned  to the Island on the second of Novem-  ber accompanied by my wife. I spent the  winter of 1838 upon the Islands accom-  panied a short time by Brother James  Townshend. During my mission upon  the Islands I was opposed by the Bap-  tist minister, Gideon J. Newton, of the  North Island, and by Elder Douglass, a  Methodist minister of the South Island.  Both made war upon me, but the con-  gregations of both embraced the Gos-  pel and I baptized most of their mem-  bers. I received a letter from President  Thomas B. Marsh, on the sixteenth of  August, 1838, informing me that I had  been called by revelation to fill a vacancy  in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles,  in the place of one who had fallen. I  had organized a company of fifty-three  of those I had baptized to go to Missouri  in the Fall of 1838. As they were all  fishermen and knew nothing about trav-  eling, I went on to the mainland and  purchased horses, wagons and harness,  and fitted them out for their journey,  and on the fourth of October we started  on our travels. We traveled through rain,  mud, frost and snow with much suffering,  and buried several who died on the  way, arriving at Rochester, Sangamon  County, Illinois, on December nineteenth,  where I spent the winter in providing  for my family and company.    On the thirteenth of March, 1839, I   took my family and went to Quincy,  Illinois. Arrived there on the sixteenth,  where I saw the suffering of the Saints  who lay upon the banks of the Missis-  sippi river, who had been driven from  Missouri for their religion, and this be-  fore the subject of Polygamy had been  revealed to the Church or to the world.    I accompanied President Young and  several of the Twelve to the Temple  Block in Far West, where we laid the  corner stone of the Temple, upon which  stone, on the twenty-sixth of April, 1837,  Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith  were ordained Apostles and members of  the quorum of the Twelve. This meet-  ing was appointed by revelation and  commandment and we performed all  that we were commanded to do. We  returned to Quincy on the second day of   May. While we were performing this  journey Joseph the Prophet and his  brother Hyrum got out of prison in  Missouri and arrived at Quincy, where we  met with them, their families and friends  and had a joyous time. I accompanied  President Brigham Young with our  families from Quincy to Nauvoo and  settled at Montrose. I was with Joseph  Smith and the Twelve Apostles on the  twenty-first of July, 1839, which was the  day of God's power with the Prophet.  He healed a score of the sick by the  power of God; they were raised up from  their beds of sickness, some of them  being nigh unto death, including Elijah  Graham and Bates Nobles.    The Twelve Apostles were command-  ed of the Lord to go to Great Britain on a  mission and to carry the gospel of Christ  to that land. As I was preparing to  start on the twenty-fifth of July, 1839 I  was attacked with the chills and fever for  the first time in my life, my wife and child  were also sick. On the eighth of August  I arose, sick, from my bed, laid my hands  upon my wife and child, blessed them and  left them in the hands of the Lord, with   not more than four days provisions in the
