I would say that thosewho accompanied Elder woodruff are sucesfuly laboring indiferent parts of England and are much help to us in theministry the church in London is doing well under the teachingsof Elder E.

 G. S. L. City, July 12, 18594 p.m.Bro. G. A. Smith,As Brother Jaques has given you most of the news, I will only write a few lines. The army flour inspectors are condemning nearly all the flour taken there under the Holliday contract. We cannot ascertain what amount of forged drafts upon U. S. were found upon in the possession of Brewer and Mc Kenzie. Report says from $5000 to $500,000. Who is connected with them in it? we have not learned. When Col. Crossman found that Mc Kenzie had a hand in it, he jumped up and down like a crazy man, saying— "By —, we well make this stick on B. Y. this time." Our lawyers will not go to Camp Floyd to argue any case. Wilson says he thinks Cradle-baugh and Sinclair will join issue against Bu-chanan and Judge Black. If they do, the executive of the nation must be in danger.Sunday evening I met in council, at the President's office, with the Twelve and about a dozen from the south. Nothing special.Stout and Blair are writing to the Governor their reasons for not going to Camp Floyd. A brother, a Collier, I do not know his name, has found a fine bed of coal on Chalk Creek, on the Weber, about 10 miles from the mouth of Echo Kanyon. There are three veins, one above another, each

 three feet thick. He has taken out some of the coal and burnt it, and pronounces it of the very best kind. He has made a contract to deliver 100 tons to President Young at 20 dollars per ton. Sharpe is going out to examine it. I think there is no mistake this time.Greeley called upon Dr. Bernhisel and said he would accompany him to see President Young, but he has not yet done it. He takes up his abode at Dot-sons, in Whiskey street. He may become so whiskeyized as not to go out of their channel.O. P. Rockwell has captured Clark, the horse stealer, who is now in the calaboose.

 Great Salt Lake City U. T. September 12th 1857Brother Ilus, F Carter Portland Maine.I once more improve the opportunity of addressing a few lines to you, and our Maine friends; but when another opportunity will offer, I know not.I will say we are all well, and all is still peacein Utah, notwithstanding the armies of the United States are approaching our borders with the intention of destroying us as far as they can. I presume you are aware that our mails have been stopped, and an enemy on theway here to chastize us, and make Presbyterians of us at the point of the sword.We are certainly living in interesting times. As to news I hardly know where to begin or end. It is universal health and peace. We have gathered the greatest harvest of wheat we have ever known in this Territory, and it is so with every crop we have put in the earth. Our wheat and oats was as high as my head; corn as stout as can grow out of the earth, potatoes the best I ever saw, so with all vegetables. Peach and apple trees are breaking down under their loads; and on the top of this great harvest we have a fair prospect of war with the United States. This is certainly interesting, that the Government of the United States, of Twenty five millions of people should make war upon a little handful of people in the mountains 
 Historian's Office Great Salt Lake City U. T.Jan. 7th 1858.Brother IlusDear Sir,As the California mail is about to start, I feel to improve the opportunity of droping a few lines to you. I must of course run the risk of itsever reaching you. I wrote you a long letter by DocrBernhisel, which I trust you got. I then told you myfeelings, and our determinations with regard to submittingany longer to the oppression of our enemies. The armysent by the President of the United States, approached toFort Bridger one hundred and fifteen ^miles^ from this City,and there stopped for the winter, the inhabitants of thatCountry burned every thing to the ground at the approach ofthe enemy; they burned up improvments worth about$300,000 dollars and retired into Salt Lake County. The army is now in Winter Quarters, we shall defend ourselvesas long as we can, then burn every thing and flee to theMountains; we all feel it to be more honorable to even looseour lives in maintaining those rights and blessingguaranteed unto us by the Constitution and Laws of our Country, than to longer submit to tyranny, oppression and religious persecution.I forward you by this mail, three papers, one containingYoung's message, and our last issue of Jan. 6th, 1858.also an extra containing our memorial to Congress[ink faded] all the members of the Legislature, and also Govr. 
 a thousand miles from any body, because they are Mormons and theirour religion differs from theirs in a measure, and that too from the tales of liars and scoundrels, without sending an Investigating Committee to prove whether the tales are true or false; but upon the mere rumor of such vagabonds as Drummond, have sent out an army of 2500 men to force us to do as they say.You may ask what we will do? I will tell you and all our friends what we shall do, and it is the only thing we can do, and preserve ourselves, and that is to fight.What, fight the United States? Yes, and all Hell, if they come against us to destroy us. We have either got to do this, or put ropes on our necks and walk out and say 'Gentlemen, will you please hang us,' and this we are not disposed to do; we had rather die fighting for our lives, liberties and rights, and defending the Constitution of the United States, against a mob, even if this mob be legalized by a town, city, county, state, or the nation than to any longer bear the persecution we as a people have had to pass through for the last 25 years. We are determined to bear these things no longer, even if we are opposed by the United States, or the world.We have broken no law, either of God or man; the Constitution and Laws of the United States guarantee unto us all that we ever have asked for, and if they make war upon us it is because of our religion, and the ungodly persecution and treatment of our Government towards Utah is too plainly manifest not to be mistaken.

Brother Woodruff and Wife leaves tomorrow forManchester Brother Clarke and family are well BrothersHolmes Sheets Straton and clarke were in the office yesterdayand are well. We all have Enough to occupy our time &tallent. the pressent general conference will Be one of muchimportance in Many instances, in all my travels I haveinquiered of the minds of the Saints about joining theirfunds to const. Manufactorys in Nauvoo and I have foundthe Saints all willing to Enter into arrangment on thissubject and the prospect at present is that we shall organizea company of Saints with shares of one poun[d] each some willPaid by instalments within one year some will take 50shares and I think that by Next January a commityapointed By the company can come to Nauvoo to commenceopperations with about 10 thousand pounds to be Laidout in Nauvoo, without infringing upon the donationstowards the ^suport of the^ church it is proposed that the companey shallout in con[c]ert with the companeys alredy Established in Nauvooin Building up the Kingdom of God and affording labor tothe poor saints on their arrival in that country.I will forward to you a copy of the articals and the minutesof the General conference at the Earliest oppertunity.I shall Enclose to you an Extract from the Books in the officeshowing the amount of money I have Received since I cameto the office and from what source and how Expendedthat you may Judge whether I have done Right or wrongeif I have done wrong I will Rectify all Erors as far as I canwhen shown to me. I have this to say that I have done theBest I know how according to my cthe circumstances inwhich I was placed. I do not think that I can Leave ^here^ beforenext January for home. 
 God has set up his Church and Kingdom upon the Earth: we are this Kingdom, God is with us, and this is the reason why all hell is boiling over against us. The Government has sent the most corrupt set of scoundrels to rule over us that can be found on earth, and yet we have treated them with kindness, and they have gone away and lied about us as bad as they had power to do.You may laugh at the idea of our standing against the United States if they come against us, but when they fight against us they will fight against God, and they will find it out before they get through with it; they will find it worse than the Florida war, and they will want to let out the job of killing the Mormons before they get half through with it, and when this nation begins to destroy any part of the the inhabitants for their religion it will be a signal for the downfall of our Government, and it is as sure to fall as there is a God in Israel.Capt. Van Vliet, Asst. Quarter Master of the U. S Army came in advance of the troops with 30 men as his body-guard, to visit our city. He left all his men at Ham's Fork, and came in with two of our brethren. He has been here several days and has been kindly treated by the Governor and all the people. Governor Young has told him all ourintentions and kept nothing back. He is satisfied thatwe are belied and abused, and he will do all he can toavert the impending storm.I invited him to my house to day, and through my

He will attend meeting tomorrow.Governor Young fit him out with teams, and on Monday he will start back to meet the Troops who are now this side of Laramie. Dr J. M. Bernhisel goes backwith him to Washington.The Captain is much pleased with the appearanceof things in this city, and greatly desires that a collisionmay be avoided.I will tell you plainly, Bro. Ilus, we have been persecuted by various portions of the Government of the United States, as long as we shall bear it, we shall not let an Army come into this Territory for we know and understand the motive and meaning in all these things; we shall fight until we die, and if the worst comes to worst, we shall lay waste every city in this Territory, and burn every thing that is wood, to ashes, and flee to the mountains, and hide our wives and children in the caves and rocks, and our enemies will find the moun-tains and kanyons and plains filled with warriorsfor the next 25 years; they will lay waste our enemies year by year, as often as they bring armies against us; and the judjgements of our God will rest upon them as a nation until they will have all the blood, war, calamity, and woe that will be necessary to satisfy them, and also to avenge the blood of the prophets.We are determined in our plans, and by the help of 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City, March 29, 1859.Brother John Butler.The history of the Galatin election riot, as given in Mother Smith's History of Joseph Smith the Prophet, page 221, is, I believe, incorrect. As you took a pro-minent part in that affair you will confer a favour by furnishing this office with a correct account of that trans-action, it being the first blow struck by the mob to-wards expelling the Saints from the State of Missouri. Your early attention to this matter is desirable, as the book is undergoing correction.W. Woodruff 
 God we shall carry them out, so if they undertake to wage a war of extermination against the 'Mormons' they will find a war upon their hands which will be the dearest one they have ever undertaken since they have been a nation, for long before the United States of America conquer the Almighty, kill 100,000 'Mormons', and 1,000,000of Indians, and have to march 1000 miles over a barren desert, through mountains and Kanyons to accom-plish it, they will find themselves with an empty treasury in the grave. But if they are determined to try it, let them try it, and you watch the signs of the times, and you will see where victory lies, you will find that the victory is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift: but I leave this subject.Several of the Government baggage trains are in our Territory, with nothing to protect them. Some 800soldiers are on the way, this side of Laramie; where they will winter I do not know, but it will not be this side of the mountains.We are making all the preparations for war we can. There will not probably be any mails, but if you can send me letters any how, do so as I would like to hear from you. You can correspond with Dr Bernhisel upon any matter while he is in Washington. There are many things I would like to write, which I mustomit. Mrs Woodruff and the children are all well.

 Father Woodruff is well.We, as a people, feel well, never better. Should war drive us to leave our homes, and cut down our orchards and go into the mountains it would ^be^ what is called a sacrifice, and we would rather not be driven to it, but we shall do it if necessity calls for it, and do the best we can; but if it comes to this we shall go east next, to settle in Jackson County Missouri, and build our great Temple there, according to the revelations given unto us through the Prophet Joseph in his day.Remember us to Father Carter, and to all our friends in Maine, and, could I speak to all the inhab-itants of the United States, with one voice, even those that are making war upon us, sending armies to destroy us, laying plans in secret chambers to take our lives, or giving consent to the shedding of our blood, to all such I would say, we ask not for your sympathy or pity, but prepare to weep for yourselves and your children, for as the Lord God lives will his judgements rest upon you, and youwill as a nation be visited by thunders, lightnings, tempestsearthquakes, pestilence, famine, war and devouring fire. Our nation is doomed to be rent asunder, and fall to rise no more; the wicked will slay the wicked, and they will soon have enough to attend to to take care of their own lives without making war upon the 'Mormons.'And I say, in the name of Jesus Christ these things are at the door of the American nation, and there is far more safety in Zion than in Babylon, for God will

 Provo, Utah Co, Utah TerritoryJune 30 1858Brother Lyman WightYour letter dated Mountain Valley Augt. 4 [18]57 has just arrived,it has been detained from us by the Army of the United States, and it has veryfortunately survived the almost universal destruction of all our Mail matter, we regretthat we could not have received your history in season for publication; a sketch whichhad been prepared you will see in the Deseret News, which is now published atFillmore, 100 miles from this City.The brief sketch of the History of the Twelve, had beenforwarded to the Printers, they are only intended as a synopsis, leaving each of themthe opportunity to publish the same in full, at their leisure.Your letter has been read to George A. Smith, Amasa Lyman,Charles C. Rich, and your two nephews Stephen and Ephraim Wight, who are all presentwhile I am writing this.We have ever entertained the warmest feelings for you personally,and regret exceedingly that your course has led you from our midst; instead ofbuilding up ourselves, we have labored as one man to build up the Kingdom of God:you complain that Prest. Young used the pronoun I too much to suit you. He wasthe President of the Twelve, and the quorum backed him up and sustained him, you claiming more authority than the Eleven, went your own way, we regret the resultexceedingly: it was your duty not only to council with the Twelve, but to take theircounsel.You refer to the revelation which says "it is my will t[h]atmy servant Lyman Wight shall continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness" &cthe spirit of meekness was the condition of the promise. "I will receive him unto myself" 
 L.D.S. Historian's Office,P. O. BOX 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, 188I am Enjoying vay good health, at presentand feel in good spirits. If I live I shallsee my 80 Birth day the 1 March, 20 dayshence, but that figure looks vary strangeto me to think off. I can hardly comprehendit. I do not feel that old, yet I supposeit is so, when I look back to the daysof Kirtland & Joseph Smith and the Apostles I feel almost alone, as almost all personsthat I was acquainted with thare are in theSpirit World, president Taylor is almost the ownly man ^living^ that I can think of thatI was acquainted with thare still thareare a few living When I see so many passingaway I feel as though my time cannot befar away but it is all right I would liketo be prepared when called I see from Lettersthe "Loyal Leage" offer $2000 for the Presidency, and Gilsom$500 for President Taylor, & $300 for Geo Q. Cannon. I willsay that Any Republican government Like theUnited States who will seek thae destruction ofa Man Like president Taylor for keeping the command-ments of God, A Man who has one been Murdered& mingled his Blood with the prophets for the Gospls sake 
 whichwhich appears to us to be evidently wanting, when you declared in Nauvoo that you would notturn your hand over to be one of the Twelve, and it seems to us impossible that you shouldforget the caution of the Lord in the Book of Covenants in June 1831 "let my servant LymanWight beware for Satan ^Brother Lyman^ desireth to sift him as chaff". Brother Lyman we ask you, tothink for a moment of the great promises made to men in ^an^ the foundation of Jany 1841 whohave fallen, or who have apostatized us and remember that all those promises are upon cond^it^ionsWe will name Bennet the Lord promised to crown him with glory if he continued;also George Miller is declared without guile, did he "continue"? William Lowe you rememberhad great blessings in the same revelation, and the conditions of them all, that he continueto observe the counsels of the Presidentcy. when Joseph was taken away, the Priesthoodcontinued with the quorum of the Twelve, with the fulness of the authority of the Priesthood,and when you turned your heels against it, Satan had you in his [sive], and like chaffyou were blown away. Come back again, brother Lyman, and dwell in Zion, andresume your duty enjoined upon you by the Lord, and preach for Zion in meekness, andlisten to the councils of the Presidency, the Church, and dare to arrogate to yourselfauthority over your brethren. Brigham Young ordained you to the apostleship he was thePresident of the quorum, and every member of that quorum whom Satan did not blow awayas chaff, have stood with and by him, and faced every storm with him, as you wouldhave done, if the light of the Spirit had been with you, "and he that gathereth not with us,scattereth abroad".Prest. Young by his persevering industry, untiring energy, and unexampledfaithfulness, has been enabled to gather the Saints into the mountains, to the very place that Josephhad organized a company to explore: sent the Elders to almost every nation; translated the book of Mormon, and the revelations into many languages, and published them to the fourquarters of the earth; and been enabled to defend the Saints from the unconstitutional aggressionsof our chief Magistrate. The God of Israel hath done [him] thus his servant Brigham, andhis faithful brethren who have stood by him while those who led away factions, have wasted& are forgotten: many from your State and even some of your own posterity have found their way to Zion 
 Such a Nation ought to feel the wrath ofAlmighty God, and be broaken in peaces, and thesceptre any Government taken out of their handsand given into the hands of rightous menwhich will be the case as the Lord Loves, For NoNation never did nor never can live longongafter persuing the course the United Stats aredoing today. I thank the Lord the presidency areprsesevd ^preserved^ so far, and I hope & pray they may beuntill they behold Zion and her inhabitatsvictorious and her Enemies cut down.Brother Joseph F was quite sick the LastI heard from him, with the Bronchitis & Iheard Brigham Discorse But you probably know moreof his condition thatn I do. I dreamed a weekago that Lorenzo Snow was liberated by thedcision of the Supreme Court of the U.S. I headthis morning that their decision Reversddthe Decision of the Utah Courts. I will conferdI had but vary little faith that the SupremeCourt would do any for us if thy could help it.I trust to Brothr Cannon or Nutall to transldtranslate my penmanship.

 Great Salt Lake CityMarch 8, 1859.Col. Tho. L. Kane.Dear Sir -- I am compiling thehistory of our exodus from Nauvoo to thesevalleys of the mountains in 1846.  This partof the history of theChurch of Jesus Christ of LatterdaySaints will be not only presented as one of themost striking and prominient events in the dealingsof God with this people in their rise and progress, butit will stand in bold relief as the main key of theAmerican history of the nineteenth century.Closely intermingled with this conmemora-ble history, which will be read with feelings of deepinterest by future generations, the name of Col. Thos.L. Kane stands most prominent, not only as aphilanthropist, and one that made superhumanexertions to dam up and roll back a mightyflood of wrath, indignation, and persecution,issuing forth from a powerful nation of twentymillions of freemen, with the intention of anni-hilating, at one fell swoop, thirty thousand men,women, and children, because they had theindependence of mind to worship God accordingto the dictates of their own consciences, and tofulfil the destiny marked ^out^ for them by the Godof heaven, but as an instrument in the hands 
 since My return fromDetroit I Have felt that as soon as I couldget my Business & family straitened around so thatthey would not suffer, that if My Brethren feltthe spirit that it was the Lord's will I wouldbe more than willing to be one of about five Missionaries to go to the Yakies in SonoraMexico that same People that are or Have beenin trouble with the Mexicans & who areof the same grade or inteligence as the Ysletasnow there are some reasons that to me seems goodthat it is a proper time to open the door of the Gospellto them, Amediately.My experience in thisdirection & with this Peopl is that they are verystrong Catholicks it Has been rooted & groundedin them for ages together with the Power that thePriests Have over them, thus forming as it werean iron Band which up to date our Elders Havefound to be a very great Barier 
 You complain that Orson Hyde, W. W. Phelps and T. B. Marsh have been received into theChurch. Hyde and Phelps were received and endowed by Joseph Smith, and we have yet to learn thateven you objected to it in his life time. Marsh lived upon [fauks] for more a sco[r]e of years, and finallywandered a miserable object of pity, poor, naked, destitute and disconsolate, and appeared befo[re] acongregation of 8000 Saints, and humbly asked them to forgive him, and let him at least dwel inour midst; they did forgive him, and permitted him to be baptized, and he remains a member,a living, palsied, limping spectacle of the fruits of apostacy, had you have been in the midst ofZion, he would have asked you, as he did all the Saints, to forgive him.You remind us that in Jackson Co., in Zion's camp, and in Caldwell, you werecalled upon to lead the Armies of Israel, when they were surrounded by their enemies, thehosts of hell; the reason you was called upon was, you was at your post, then, you was therein the midst of Israel, valiant in the testimony of Jesus and the defence of Israel; but when thetremendous power of one great man James Buchanan goaded on by the clamor of the people, was hurling his legionsupon the Children of Zion, ^to crush from the Earth, the Priesthood;^ and when the nerve of every faint hearted member trembled to the center,and the bloody war cry was reiterated from every corner of Christendom "wipe out Mormonism",where was its old defender? was he in the midst of the trouble; was he the foremost todefend the innocent; to lift the Standard of Zion; to face the monster; fearless, and determined to encourage the Saints in the dread encounter? or was he reclining at hisease in the sunny plains of the far famed Elysium of bliss, Texas, writing to me and my Brethren the Twelve, as if in bitter irony "I thought you was too popular to thinkof an old codger like me."You was cut off from the Church in the latter part of 1848, the subjectwas brought up on the receipt of a pamphlet which you published against theAuthorities of the Church.Brother Lyman come home to Zion, mingle in our midst, confessand forsake your sins, and do right, as we and all men have to do, in order to enjoythe favor of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and have fellowship with the Saints,then, and not 'till then, will your path be lit up so that you can walk in safety, 
 2of God, and inspired by him, to turn away, in 1858, the edge of the sword, and save the effu-sion of much blood, performing what the combinedwisdom of the nation could not accomplish, andchanging the whole face of affairs, the effects ofwhich will remain forever. Your name will ofnecessity stand associated with the history of thispeople for years to come, whatever may be theirdestiny. As a historian I am in duty boundto write the truth & record the facts, and, as the firstcompilation of our history at present falls uponme, I feel [all] the necessity of communicatingwith you upon this subject. We have on fileyour letters to [us &] communications with the leadersof this people, [com]mencing while we were on ourpilgrimage in the wilderness, and continuingmore or less up to this day. We have alsocopies of some letters to you from your worthy, noble,and honored father, breathing forth nothingbut the inspirations of a great and goodheart, and good will tow[ar]ds an oppressedpeople. We have also letters from the War Depart-ment and other sources, for our good, [and ] whichwere originated through your infl[uence.] Thesewe wish to record upon our jour[nals for preserva-]tion. We also desire to publish, in our history [to]the world, all matters appertaining to or conn[ec] 
 This Yakie Nation are not now underthis Catholic Youke & they are exibitinga firm determination not to be subjugatedto their Mexican neighbors but we Know thatthey must & will submit ere long as theirnumbers will not warrant them against theGoverment of Mexico or even Sonorait seems to me that 5 good Elders couldmake a start in that direction begining withor at the line as they enter Mexico or Sonorataking up their labors among the Mexicans asopprortunity & doors were opened to themMoving quietly & constantly towards theYakies Nation which last named place wouldbe the Principle object in view togather withother viliges & smaller Lamenitestownsthat may Have Broken off in years Past & Havelived for ^so^ many years seperated that they Havelost all recollection of any Kindred ties

We all feel interested in your welfare; you have no enemies here; thelonger you stay away from us, the more alienated your feelings become; the Lorddwells in Zion; His Spirit and power is in our midst: He has delivered us andgiven us the victory up to the present day, and we acknowledge his hand in all these things.Brothers G. A. Smith, A. Lyman, C. C. Rich and your nephews Ephraimand Stephen Wight, all wish to be remembered to you with the best of feelings:we all respect you for you gallant course in defending your brethren against theirpersecutors in times past, and trust that the day is not far distant when wemay again see you a humble man, with your brethren in Zion building up theKingdom of God.We shall be pleased to receive a letter from you at any time.Yours trulyW.

 with us, which we deem to be of interest, as far aswisdom and prudence dictate. Any matterswhich should not be made public we wish to preserveupon our words.Now, my dear Sir, I write to ask yourconsent to our wording in our history your visitswith us, your labors, services, and benefits bestowedupon us as a people, commencing with the organ-iration of the Mormon Battalion in 1866, and con-tinuing to the present time, and hencweforth andforever, though as far as the feeble efforts of a his-torian are concerned, they are but a poor reward forthe benefits received. We would like also to publishyour corespondence, as we advance in the dates, andsome letters from your father (God bless him! he posesseda noble soul), one bearing date Aug. 18, and theother Sep. 4, 1846. His letters contain nothingbut good will to an afflicted people, and greatanxiety for his son, who was sick in our midst.We wll endeavour to use prudence in anything weprint. Nothing of our history goes to press untilit has been thoroughly inspected by President B.Young. Please drop me a note upon thissubject at your convenience, and you will muchoblige me.I feel thankful that the Lord watched overyou and preserved you through all the dangers 
 I trust that you will not feel that I amforward in this Matter as I Have been taught thatit was the liberty of an Elder to offer himselfI will remember being Present when Pres-Youngsaid that if the Elders Knew their duties that insteadof him being compelled to call & ask & beg for some-one to Perform Missions that they would be at his elbow awaiting & sugesting to himI will only add that this Has been uponMy Mind in such a Manner that I Have beencompelled to call your attention to the abovefacts & I trust that you will give it some reflection.The next subject is one that came upwhen you was with Me in New Mexico & atMy House.you will remember that yousaid to me that you thought it better for Me notto add any More to My Family at least for the Present as it mite destroy the Happiness thatexisted with us & that seemed to be permanent 
 [imminent]  to your visit to us in 1858, and yourreturn home, where you have again the privilege of enjoying the society of your dear wife, children,and friends. Should it ever be the will of the Lord for you to visit us again, I hope it will be under circumstances more favorable to your [own]comfort and care, than them [illegible]  with your last visit: I am sure there is not aman in the world, who would be [illegible] with mine joy, or a [tribe] to our territory, than our friend and benefactor, [Mr.] Kane.

 Historians's Office.G. S. L. City, Sept. 2nd. 1858.Elder W. W. PhelpsDr Bro:We recieved your note of Sept 11th.complaining of a [putissers] in the history of LymanWight, that he considered [joisy] transgression for selling land in Jackson Co.We would be very sorry to publish any thingthat is not correct, and especially to injure the char-acter or feelings of any of our brethren, but the Historyof Joseph Smith Feby. 5th, 1858 stresses that "ElderLyman Wight stated, that he considered all other accu-sations of minor importance compared to their sellingtheir lands in Jackson county; that they (Phelps andWhitmer) had set an example which all the Saints wereliable to follow. He said that it was a hellish principle,and that they had flatly denied the faith in so doing."Now, whether the fact was so, or not, is not the point at issue, but the above shows that Lymanconsidered it was so, and that is all that is stated;and as this history was compiled while you wereone of the Historians, we consider the written authoritysufficient reason for our declining to publish a contradic-tion of the statement and particularly as it now leaves"Lyman to lie on his own hook."

Our settlements extend north-wardly one hundred and ten miles andsoutheasterly three hundred and thirty miles,the whole country being a desert, except thoselittle spots that are rendered green by the springsfrom the mountains.

 Provo Utah Feb 11th 1895Dear Brother:You mentioned in one of your letters, that thefact, that when a person receives the Gospel, that he receivesno rest or satisfaction only as he is engaged in spreadingthe good word among our father's children, and in callingthem to flee from the wrath to come, is to you "another tellinglink in the chain of evidence of the correctness of the latter-day work," is no daubt correct, and it called to mymind some of my experience while in the church in myearly youth, and some of my experience after I had driftedaway.As you and myself have been on terms of intimacy forsome time, I felt that I would like to write you as tosome of these experiences I have stated above, because theyare largely the external witnesses that helped to fastenin my breast the "assurance of faith" that I now enjoyof the correctness and divinity of the mission of JosephSmith, and the "latter day work."My first connection with the church was in Englandwhile a mere boy, but young as I was, I now look back

 present situationMy immediate and ultimate resolve is to be a proper ordained missionary for Hindustanbut as you may also seethis impracticable justnow, the rules not admittingof it, I must be contentto work as a lay missionary.I have some adherentsbut the different the opions they are serving is a greatdeal in their way of honestthinking.There I may just briefly state that though for 34years of my life I have been a Presbyterian, I have never ceased to hanker for something not completed. 
 and remember with what joy and satisfaction my faith inthe gospel gave me. I have attended testimony meetings withmy father where the spirit of the Lord was so strongly diffused,that I have felt as though I was in the presence of GodHimself. My feelings have been so buoyant, so light, thatit seemed as though I was walking on air; and whenI retired to rest at night, with that calm, that "Heavenlyframe," surrounding me,—yes, entirely enveloping me—Ihave been led to exclaim "Surely goodness and mercy willfollow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell inthe house of the Lord forever."After I left Utah, my father and mother went to Englandand I remained in Kansas. My faith remained strong fora good while, in fact I never denied the faith, but mysurroundings were such that I drifted away, and the goodspirit I enjoyed left me. When I came out of the Armyin 1864 my relatives and friends were nearly all Presbyterians,I had donated a sum of money to help build a churchand the Pastor wished me to be one of the board of Trustees,to which I consented, but later requested me to allowmy name to go on the church books. To this I did not

 at first consent to, largely on the ground that I did not un-derstand the full import of the Confession of Faith. Aftersome importunity on the part of my relatives, I consentedprovided I should not be required to subscribe to the Con-fession of Faith, which the Pastor and the "Lession" consentedto. I became a Presbyterian in that way, my only baptism(except when a child by the church of England) being that Ireceived when I first became a Latter day Saint.Becoming involved in political controversy, I gavevery little attention to theological subjects, and for sometime I went along quite smoothly. Later along I beganto give the subject some thought, but the moment I beganto think, to study and enquire, that moment I becameuneasy, and doubts and fears would encompass meabout until I was really unhappy. I attended prayer meetings, but found no comfort.In the town in which I resided there existed quite anatheistic, an infidel element, which caused me to begin ametaphysical investigation. I read Spencer Tindal,in fact both sides, but landed in the Theistical school,and began to combat the other side. 
 1— Q. I invite your attention to an Epistle of President S. W.Richards as reported in Vol. 14 of the Millennial Star at page259, which reads as follows: "It is the duty of everyofficer in the Kingdom of God to turn his heart, his feelingsand his affections to his President, and as you seek after thespirit of the Lord to enable you to do his will, so with thesame fervency of soul seek after the spirit and the will ofyour President to do the same with all lowliness of heart."Permit me to ask you whether or not you do not now believeand teach in accordance with the above doctrine? If you nolonger believe in that doctrine, when and where has any modi-fication of it ever been published?1— A. 
 This diverted my attention for a year or two, but findingI could not give the requisite time to a full investigation, I was compelled to drop it. The time however that I hadgiven the subject, caused me to investigate the faith thatI was supposed to defend. I began on predestination,but it staggered me. The question that confronted me, staredme in the facte, disturbed my sleep at night, and my thoughtsby day, was. "Am I one of the elect?" How shall I determinethis question. I went to my Pastor I laid my condition before him. I asked him for some assurance. He toldme to "go to the Lord in prayer." He would preach theeternal sufferings of the damned, a suffering, a tormentso terrible, that when the mind would attempt to calculateits duration, and would figure on the countless agesof eternity as they rolled along, and passed beyond ourconception, then this suffering, this agony had justbegun. It is difficult for me to express my feel-ings. It occassionally occurred to me of the infinitesatisfaction I had in my early days, and I wouldsay to myself  "O! that I could feel that way now."Do what I may, I got no releif. If any one was in

 2— Q. In Vol. 5 of the Journal of Discourses at page 209 it issaid, "Jesus Christ is the head of the church and he got aman to represent him on earth, namely Brigham Young. JesusChrist is still the head of the church and his will to men onearth will be known by means of the mouth piece of God theProphet and Seer." Do you not believe and teach this to betrue, holding that President Wilford Woodruff as the successorto Brigham Young enjoys the same gift? If not, when was the privilege of the mouth piece of God curtailed in this re-spect?2— A. 
 a "slough of despond" as Bunyan describes, that one wasme. In 1886 I was taken quite sick, and my physicians ad-vised me to take a trip to the mountains. When I was able totravel I came to Salt Lake City. The next sunday I went tothe tabernacle. They sung "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning,"and Bishop Whitney preached. While I sat there some verystrange sensations came over me. The long ago came be-fore my eyes, and I thought "How strange."When I left my home in Kansas I intended to return, butstrange as it may appear I am here yet.Being out of the church, what part I took in political mat-ters, was necessarilly with the Liberal party, but while I soacted I think every one will hear me witness that I never de-nounced a "Mormon." I alway would say to myself, "that isthe faith my father died in," and I know he was honest.In 1890 I began a thorough investigation of theologicalmatters. My mind was drifting towards "Mormonism." Idetermined to satisfy myself, and it was that which causedme in February 1892 to write the letter I did withdrawingfrom the Liberal party.The more I thought, the more I became convinced that

 the latter day work as established by Joseph Smith was the work ofGod, and finally that the path of duty required me to becomereunited with the church. Of course I forsaw what wouldfollow. I knew that contumely would be heaped upon me. Iknew that the finger of scorn would follow me. I knew that socialostracism would come, but I determined to take the step, andleave the consequences with my God. And with that step camepeace of mind, tranquility of soul, and I feel to exclaim"I know that my Redeemer lives." The assurance of faith thatfor so long I sought for, but never found, today I have,and enjoy. The despair I encountered as a Presbyterian,today is changed to a joyous hope of a glorious immortality,and that if I endure to the end, if I prove faithful, that Ishall gain the crown of glory, shall regain the presence of myHeavenly Father, and dwell with hHim in His eternal Kingdom"Worlds without end"I have written you quite a lengthy letter. I hope it will not provetedious. The subject is interesting to me, which I suppose makesme think it ought to be to everyone.With my best wishes. From Your Brother in the GospelA. Saxey 
 4— Q. Vol. 1 Journal of Discourses page 161, in which Heber C.Kimball speaks of Brigham Young has this: "If Brother Brig-ham tells me to do anything it is the same as though the Lordtold me to do it. This is the course for you and every othersaint to take."Substituting Wilford Woodruff in place of Brother Brig-ham do you not still believe and teach the saints that doc-trine? And does it not apply with equal force to all temporalas well as to religious affairs? If not, when and where hasit ever been limited or qualified?4— A.

 Merthyr Tydfil Jany. 2nd, 1846.My Dear Bro. Woodruff,Judging by yr former cau^r^se of devotedness to, and wellwishes forthe best interests of the Welsh Saints, ^nation^ methinks t'wil be interesting to hearof their present prosperity & future prospects; this interesting topic has merited a placein the bosom of the Prophets & Apostles of this dispensation to some extend, it was ourfavorite theme in the Western climes; and now, those glorious anticipations whichwe fondly cherished for many a sweet hour while pacing the Deck, at the still hoursof ^the^ midnight watch, are being realised beyond my expectations; in fulfilment of thepredictions of our beloved prophet e'er I started on this mission & e'er his exit to the abode of bliss.Bro. Henshaw & myself, after we parted with you at Manchester, bent our course through Woolverampton & Birgmingham, were we met the Saints in good spirits, allalive for the "Joint Stock Co." realising as Father Crook told them ^that^ their life & atcdepended on its success: here we parted with our beloved Bro. Davies of Londonand proceeded in Co with Bro. Heliday to Bristol, being too late for the Packet, metwith the Saints next day (Sunday) introduced their new Sheperd to them, congratulatedthem on their happy union, preached to them about the new Gospel, alias Joint Stock Co. andBro. Heliday & Henshaw edified them much judging by their union & love; then theformer left for Bath, the latter and myself next mor'g for Cardiff, thence by Railway home& found all well. The Saints have rented a large Hall here in Merthyr, much larger thanthe one that the Saints meet in, at Manchester; in this, -- held a Meeting on Christmasday, -- by the by, this reminds me to wish you a happy New  Year, also to Sister Woodruff& family.  The object of the meeting was to explain to the Saints & others, that the banishment of the Saints from Nauvoo, was so far from being the downfall of Mormonismand the last of Zion, & the gathering, as the Priests of Baal & newspapers Editors prophecythat the reverse is precisely the case, tis another "Arcemedis lever," to propel Mormonismover the snowy clifts of ^the^ Rocky Mountain; tis another nail in the coffins of scoffers,and lay^ing^ another corner stone in Zion. poor folks, their little hearts are shut up in nutshells,the Saints rejoiced to understand the superiority of Zion over Nauvoo, and their desire is toreach there. Sunday Held a conference in the same Hall, representing 18 branchesall in a healthy and thriving conditions, showing an increase of about 200, since lastApril, about half of that no. in this branch alone, & making in all about 600 Saints inWales, & nearly all of the pure stock of Ancient Britons, & yet these are but the firstfruits of the "hosts of [Eomer] from the sides of the North," and judging by the daily increasetis well you go & prepare a place for the glorious Co. that will be, in "The fields of the woods"were else than California will afford us our lgenght & breadth of consecrated ground?Were you in our Saints' meeting in ^the^ the afternoon to see the love & union of the WelshSaints, you'd rejoise to see a double portion of the Same Spirit cementing those of diffrentnations, (speaking alternately, Welsh & English) as children of one family in the bonds of one covenant11 being confirmed and 9 children blessed, the Sacremant administered while every countenanceglistened with joy, & every eye moistened with a tear of gratitude to one filial Parent of all.

 I then in Welsh showed to the Saints, the nessesity of faithfully warning our ownnation & trying to save them e'er tis too late, that the harvest truly is great, and alreadywhite for the harvest^reapers^ and the laborers are but few, that we ought to spread theGospel by every lawful means in the course of this season, from this Nursery to the remotestparts of Cambria's hills, and proposed that more Officers shd. be called and ordained such aswd. be faithful, sealous & wise, to go two by two, Elder & Priest together, through every County inthe Principality as soon as practicable; that the Saints shd. sustain them with their prayersuntil their voices echo from the mountain tops to the deepest glens of our Father land and ^till^ the fulness of the everlasting Gospel shd. be heard in this dispensation of the fulness of times in every secluded abode of our much loved brethren. Bro Henshaw in Englishfollowed in a very warm and pathetic address, & visetted the same upon every heartthat I believe every Saints in the place, not only responded with ^a^ hearty Amen, butwere willing & anxcious to be up & doing all they could for the acompleshment ofso glorious an object. The evening meeting was ocupied by several of the Eldersin Welsh & English alternately, testifying of the great and wonderful worksof God in the age of the world & each one seemed to be filled with the Spirit of theiroffice, the Hall was crowded with anxcious hearers, many acknowledged thepower of the truth, three were babtised that night, making 7 during the ConferenceMonday at 10 Saints met for buissness -- when I in Welsh followed by BroHenshaw in English & others showed the different duties of different Officers, theabsolute nessesity of a concentration of efforts to success -- and also the danger of hidinga talent when given to Officer or member, that all could act for good in their sphere &cthence called out, & ordained 4 Elders, 19 Priests, 9 Teachers, 6 Deacons, and advisedthem to prepare to go out when their circumstances wd. permit, all to a man rejoicedin the honor of his Office & pledged their fidelity to the cause. Twas agreed on, thatall the Oficers shd. meet once a week to instruct each other in all things nessesarythe no of Officers before were 10 Elders, 10 Priests, 8 Teachers & 7 Deacons, Total nowin Wales are 14 Elders, 31 Priests, 17 Teachers, 13 Deacons, in all 76. then organised threenew branches & the meeting closed to give room for a another scenery, &judging by the busy move of a myriad of the fair, the music of the Chinaby the base of the trays, the laurels, evergreens & flowers to adarn the Hallyoud have thought twas a preparation for a splendid tea party, howeverI was not left long in doubt, for ocular demostrations like tableswell set & lined, amounts to facts you know, yes a picture thisnot of fancy, but of real life, long to be remembered, a type of the "feast of fat things, of wines on the lees," which shall be, on Mount Zion.I have been informed that some 400 cards were sold previous to the timeand perhaps twice the number partook of the feast, the Co. was as respectablein apearance, conduct, & circumstances as any tea party of the times: andI had ample proof that it was the means of doing good in various ways, all thepreposessed prejudices of the guests gave way before it, many of the Sectarians and someof the Priests I was informed came through the Hall to see our "liberty," and the more thebetter, for we had a specimen of that worthy of their admiration. I overheard conversation like the following on the right & left. "These must be a good & a loving people." "Thesecannot be guilty of the charges prefered against them by our preachers." I will be babtised e'er I go home."

If the records of TheChurch show that he and his wife were members, and also disclosewhether he was an Elder or not, I should be greatly pleased to beinformed of the fact.

 and many similar expressions of astonishment & admiration, saluted my earsamid the social chat of the lively throng. some were babtised during the meeting, othersafter meeting, & it really seems as tho shaking among the armies of the alians, and that e'er long they will flock in solid phalanx to the Standard of Mormonism,—happy day.—when the Tables were cleared and the Hall crowded I addressed them in English followedby two Welsh Elders & Bro Henshaw about the "Restoration of all things spokenby all the Holy prophets since the world began." The motto over the Stage, "Peace, Unionand brotherly love," was a good introduction to the subject, altho this subject is rathernew here, it met the almost universal aprobation, and cheered up the hope of theSaints in delightful anticipation of the happy day when the lamb & the lion shall liedown together &c, when peace, love & union shall universaly prevail, and nothing, animate or inanimate (if such there be) shall hurt or destroy in all the holy Mount.May it be the happy lot of all the Saints, to enjoy such a portion of these three great, and darling principles of heaven, as was manifested in this meeting is my desire. then they wd. be happyBut Dr. Bro, I hope you'l not get tired reading this long letter, for I have not done yet, nextcomes something about a theme if possible more interesting at the present crisis thanthe old ones, I mean to say that last night we held a meeting to advocate the "JointStock Co." you'l say that we are fond of vanities, who is not if these be a fair specim[en] [page torn]but the result was that almost all think well of it. & you know get ^where^ I get tal [page torn]about California & thereabouts, I feel as tho ^I^ was on the quarter Deck again, an[d] [page torn]my old stamping grounds.

He was considerably interested in the relic, and suggested thatI write you regarding same, and that perhaps you wouldlike to own it. The relic came into my possessionsome years ago through one of our salesmen who happened to be in Nauvoo about the time the corner stone was removed, and an old citizen of the place had possessionof this relic, and for a small consideration furnishedthe few pages which are now in my office. The relicis now in a frame and covered by glass, and should youdesire to own it I think it would be best to box itcarefully and ship it in the frame.Mr. Jos.

In addressing the twelve Apostles on the political situation of this territory you stated to them that their calling was^lay^ in a different direction than in the political feild you further stated to them that as long as Wilford Woodruff had the control of affairs in Church matters it would never happen again wou^that^ the twelve apostles or any of them should enter the feild of politics and cause disensions among the Latter-Day Saints when you asked the twelve if they understood you on this matter they answered by bowing their heads.

 what do we find to day, some of them same apostles out on the stump blacguarding their own brethren who dont happen to hold there the same opinions as they do, as a member of the church I do not think this is either right or necessary, and that evil results will arise from it, there can be no question, and I think that a man who holds a holy and honorable position in the church only degrades that office by becoming a ward heeler or a stump politican as some of our brethren who stands high in the Preisthood are doing to day, and sooner or later, "if it is not stopped"it will cause a disruption amongst the Latter-day-saintsI remain your Bro in the Gospel Nicol HoodSugar House Oct 15th 1894

 the work which will give you some idea ofit. I estimate that the matter will make about100 pages, which will be sold at about 25¢in common binding. One hundred pages ofthis type will hold a great amount of matter.The main thing clained is the size, but thefew lines of arguments thrown in betweenthe passages to refresh the mind, and lead thelearner to understand what point to make ina certain passage is also a matter worthmentioning in my mind.The subjects I have written out are"The fall of man", "The Atonement of Christ""Faith" including the personality of God, or theperson in whome we should have faith. "Repentance""Baptism" "Spirit of Good" or Holy Ghost."Devine authority", "New revelation", "Evidences ofthe Bible and Book of Mormon Compared""Pass over or Sacrament" "Gathering of Israel""Scattering of Israel"  "Apostacy"  "Retoration""Organization" "Redemption of the dead" "Plurality of wivesnot unscriptirial"

 Dear Bro. Woodruff, Kanesville Nov. 11th 1848.Your letter from Long Islandwas nice this evening, and I hasten to Sayto you that you should have written to Orson Prattthe Same Statements that you have written to me. He is the presiding officer of the Church in England,and Littlefield, it appears, has returned there andis under Bro. Pratts immediate jurisdiction.Such conduct as he is guilty of to all appea[rances],should be Sufficient to cause his immediate ex-communication from the Church, and let himlabor with his hands for his support, and returnto this place if he has any desire to be Saved.If you have written to bro. Pratt concerning himall will be well; but if you have not, I wishyou to do so, and add my Sayings to your letter.Bro. Oliver Cowdry has assisted me to put upmy press to day. Hase has returned here with hisfamily—made his satisfaction to the Church andhas been voted to the rec'd by baptism. I expectto baptize him tomorrow. I hope to get my paperout this Month and Shall forward it to youimmediately thereafter. With regard to any particulartrouble here, I have no fears at present. Still,I do not know what the Devil and wicked menmay do. I am in the house of the Lord and soare they. His will be done. I have not acted 
 If a person could be appointed to whomI could send proofs to insh insure nodoctrinal errors going through I should appre-ciate it.If this could be done I should like to have itas soon as possible, as I will need my type tokeep ahead of my lessons in the quorom.I will come down at anytime, if you think it ecessary, and show youall the manuscript.Very RespectifullyLamoni Call.I see no reason why bro. Call should nothave full liberty to publish his little work and letit stand on its own mirits. He, of course to do thework at his own expense and risk. I wouldsuggest that President Hess & Grant wouldbe good judges of its soundness in doctrine, andthat Bro.

 Liverpool Dec 15 1848To Pres. WoodruffDear Bro Your kind letter written last Spring came duly to hand, & livin I learnt your address, I have frequently wished to make a written acknowledgement of your kindness as soon as a convienent opportunity should present. I have been obliged to cease my labors in the Office, through a productive illness; but I have never lost sight of your kindness both to me & my family; and I hope hereafter to honor your memory for the same. My illness was caused by too long confinement to the Star office; this produced indigestion and consumption followed by piles of a very painful nature. But through the earnest faith of the Saints I am now pretty well restored to health. I have been travelling for near two months past among the Conferences preaching & stirring up the church to pay their tithing. I feel encouraged to believe that I shall gather a pretty good sum for the temple. There are several saints expecting soon to come into prosperation of large sums of money, before I sail for America. From them (4 persons) I hope to receive several thousand pounds as tithing to gladden the hearts of the saints in the valley.

 The additions to the Brittish Churches continue to be increasing by great, but the emigration falls much short of the inonase, and the general inquriy is, how shall we be gathered to zion. Some ten or fifteen hundred, will probably emigrate near the first of Feb. next, including several hundred from Wales with Capt Jones. But what are there among so many? Eld. Pratt estimates that 300 ships would barely suffice to carry the Brittish Saints to Zion at this time.The hopes of the wicked concerning better times for Trade & business seem to be perishing. And the popular bias now is that every man should sieze as much spoil as possible, either by fair means or by foul.Governments are seized with the same mania and the whole platform of people is like a is like a troubled sea the papal Crown has at length fallen.

 to see them pushing the sestarian Churches and demolishing human creeds as so much hay and stumble. The weak are becoming strong and the gentiles marvel. You would be astonished to see the issue of Books Stars and Fuents from the Star office every fortnight. The issue of Stars has nearly doubled since I took charge in "47" and the inneased issue of other works is in equal ratio. The line of truth sells irresistibly through the land.

 Elder W. Woodruff:-- The founding of this kingdom cost sorrow and blood.In our family circles we remember themen who founded it, and we prize those who have laid down their lives for thiswork. God has given us other men to lead us, and they are as dear to us as our former prophets were. We shouldprize their instructions, and we shouldlive in that way that we can have com-munion with God to sustain ourselvesas Elders, Bishops, Presidents, etc. If we are without the light of the gospel ofChrist, and do not live in it, we shallbecome like other men. It is necessaryfor us to grow in faith, wisdom, confi-dence, prudence, and in all the things of God, that we may understand in a measure His providences towards us;and that He has a motive in every visi-tation we may receive from His hands,in sending frost, snow and storms, bywhich the works of our hands are des-troyed, or of any other kind. We feltit hard to leave our temple in Nauvoo,but we have enjoyed a great deliverance;and should a prophet tell of the eventsof the next ten years we should notbelieve him any more than we wouldhave believed Joseph if he had told usall we have passed through since we left Nauvoo. The Lord has only just begun to deal with the people. Thejudgments of the Lord will follow oneafter another, until His work is accom-plished in the last days. God will visit the wicked of this generation withfamine and pestilence, fire and smoke, with earthquakes and a great destruc-tion. We are called to stand in thesemountains amid the crash of nationsand the wail of millions. How shallwe do this? By being [s]anctified beforeGod. We have to watch as well aspray. We must be honest men andwomen, and walk uprightly before theLord, or these mountains will not hideus from the judgments of God. Faith-fulness is required of all the people, from the Prophet and the Twelve Apostles to the least member. Faith-fulness in all things is the condition onwhich we can continue to enjoy our possessions in these mountains. We must overcome sin in the world and inourselves, and learn to sanctify our-selves that we may be saved. Whenwe are faithful, we are faithful for our-selves. God has attained His exalta-tion, and all that He has blessed uswith is for our salvation. Our eternal destiny depends upon the course wetake in this short life. If our eyes wereopened to this fact we would not sellour souls for a mess of pottage. Thecounsels we now receive are as preciousand of as much interest to us as werethe counsels of Joseph and his brethren in the early days of this church. If we give our hearts to love the things of this world and neglect our duties wecannot overcome, but we will be over-come, whereas, if we are faithful, nopower will prevail against us.

I can assure you that I amfarr from being unhappy or discontented with my lot but onthe contrary feel quite calm & perfectly at home in my elements &can truly say that the Lord has been with us uppon our Journeyand we seemed to be helped on and hurried along by the spirit allthe way & I believe performed the Journy in less time then any of the Elders have done before. I feel that we left Salt Lake about the right time and landed in Liverpool about the right time & I do not knowany thing but what all things is well with us at present at anyrate we feel that we left home with the blessing of our brotheron our heads and still have their prayers & feel that we shall knewdthem in future before we see you again in the flesh you willrecollect that we left on the 24th of Sept and we landed on the missourieNov 3 making the trip across the plains in 40 days no accident occuredother then the Shyene Indians stole six of our animals at the south forkof Platt four of them mules belonging to Br O Hide & about the same nonumber failed and were traded of at the several trading posts or left& among them the animal you let Br John Harby have.

 Elder W. Woodruff: We say we meettogether to worship the Lord and to doa great many things for Him; but we meet together for our own benefit. TheLord has obtained His glory and we have not; and He has placed us in this life to obtain our exaltation. This iswhat we are striving to obtain, and why we meet to worship God. I do notknow that we can do anything for theLord, only to be obedient to His will;and if we are obedient it is for our ownbenefit. When we build school-housesand meeting-houses, it is for ourselveswe build them. If we plant orchardsand vineyards they are for ourselves;and all we do in the great work of Godin these last days is to obtain salvationin the presence of the Lord. If we arecounseled to cease from evil, it is forour own benefit. We have offered the nations the gospel and they have re-jected it. Does it injure us? No; itinjures them; for they are under con-demnation for refusing that which isfor their own good. We have embracedthe gospel, and we are blessed withpeace and comfort and consolation; we have had the benefit of it in this lifeand it will bestow upon us eternal lifein the world to come. You cannotmake a wicked man happy by giving him property and riches. There is nopeople on the earth that enjoys so much happiness as we do. We have had hardlabor, and with it the spirit of peace, and we rejoice in the principles of eter-nal life. Our minds change as do theappearance of our faces. If we had a picture of our minds, as they were a few years ago, and were to compare itwith them now we would see a decidedadvancement in knowledge.We have been taught by our early traditions that the Lord has nothing todo with temporal things. This is a mistake. The world and its fulness areall temporal; and the Lord made them.This is a temporal kingdom, and must occupy a power on the earth. When-ever a Bishop is placed over a people,and he enjoys the spirit of his calling,his counsels to that people will be right;and the people should sustain that man,and they will be blessed in so doing.Pres. Young has labored for years toget the people to have a correct under-standing with regard to temporal things. We have formerly sold our grain fornaught; but within the last year or twoit has been worth something; and if wewould be counseled in all things wewould be blessed more abundantly,temporally and spiritually; and thiscourse would lead us to the possessionof eternal life. 
 Elder W. Woodruff: The questionmay be asked, "What object has our President in visiting this people every year?"  It is to prepare the Saints for the Lord to rule over them; and the devil is preparing the wicked for des-truction. Look abroad and see the great events that have taken place since Joseph Smith was sent with the full-ness of the gospel to the world. See the great change that has taken placein our nation. It is painful for us to reflect on the increase of crime. It seems that all civilization is departingfrom the world; but the Lord has said "I will rule over my Saints," and thekingdom shall be the Lord's. We canall see the necessity of the instructions which we receive from His servants, day by day. They are given to prepare us that the devil may not have domin-ion over us. A Latter-day Saint who lives his religion sees the kingdom of God going forth; he can understand thesigns of the times, and will live by the principles that are taught unto us, and he will see the advantage of building up this kingdom. The wicked do not see this. They are not quickened by the same spirit which quickens you. The Spirit of god is withdrawn from them,and they are groping in darkness and are being prepared for the damnation of hell. They permit the devil to govern them, and they are given over to his power; but the Lord will take care of His Saints. We all expect to have an inheritance on this earth; then why not begin to improve the earth and make it beautiful, and sanctify our-selves and the earth? The Spirit of God is with us; the same Spirit that wasin Abraham and in all the ancient fathers, to whom promises were made and from whom a royal seed has des-cended; we have the same Spirit in us, and a like work to perform. The speak-er gave an account of Abraham's des-troying the gods of his fathers, reason-ing that as the Lord had sustained him in his righteousness, so would He sus-tain us in the performance of like works.

 LECTURE AND READING ROOMS.—The first free lecture, under the auspices of theLibrary, Reading Room and Lecture Asso-ciation, took place last night, in Morgan'sCommercial College building, in the 14th Ward. The subject of the lecture was:  "Libraries and Reading Rooms;" the lecturer on the occasion was Hon. Wilford Woodruff, who, after singing and prayer,gave a very interesting lecture on the subject. He mentioned the interest he felt in the wellfare of this people, particularly intheir intellectual welfare; quoted a passagefrom the Doctrine and Covenants, con-cerning the acquisition of knowledge fromall good books; recommended reading his-tory; private means, as a general thing, wasinsufficient to establish a suitable library, even for family use, and hence the advan-tage of free reading rooms, giving the pub-lic access to the daily papers, and telegramsfrom the whole world. The reading room does much to draw the mind of youth fromthe vortex of "civilization" so-called. Mentioned his own personal experience,and the profit he had derived from read-ing travels, history and scientific works;also President Smith's excellent memory gained by cultivation. Advised the peopleto contribute books and means to thelibrary, and to improve their leisure time in treasuring up knowledge, especially ofthe rise and progress of this people and theirremarkable history. Wished the under-taking success; encouraged the committee to go forward in their work. The library will be an advantage to both old and young. Advised the keeping of a personal journal,and spoke of its interest to generations com-ing.  Said that an education was the bestlegacy, and that novels lead the mind astray;useful books vice versa. Closed by saying that the acquisition of knowledge is ofslow growth and the result of patient labor. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid he was thankful for the privi-lege of meeting with so many ofthe Latter-day Saints upon that oc-casion. He had not been able dur-ing the last four or five months tospeak in public, having been af-flicted with a cold on his lungs.One very peculiar fact was thatGod the Creator of heaven andearth and the inhabitants thereofhad always been an unpopular Be-ing with the world. The Gospel ofJesus Christ whenever taught byinspired men, in any age, hadmet with a great deal of op-position. Such had been thecase in the whole history of theworld, from the time of father Adamdown to the present. Having shownfrom Bible history how nations aswell as individuals had been pun-ished for disobedience to God andHis commandments, PresidentWoodruff continued: I say to allIsrael and the whole world todaythat the God of heaven has set His hand to perform this work in whichwe are engaged. He has raised up a Prophet who organized this Church in fulfilment ofthe records of divine truth. JosephSmith was no more popular in thegeneration in which he lived, neitherare the Apostles nor the Latter-daySaints as a body now, than was Christ and His Apostles in their day. But the God of heaven hasdecreed certain things, and thosedecrees He will carry out, whethermen believe or disbelieve. He will establish His Church, He will estab-lish His Zion, He will bring togetherHis people. The people have to be gathered from all nations underheaven or the Bible will be unful-filled.We are passing through a very peculiar kind of history. We havehad a peculiar history all the daysof our lives—ever since we have been members of this Church at least; we shall probably continue tohave until the coming of the Son ofMan. No man can be godly, true,and a faithful witness of the LordJesus Christ without suffering perse-cution and meeting with opposition.This has been the history ofthe world in every age. Be faithful, do what isright, and let the consequences fol-low. Trust in the God of heaven. He is watching over you; the eyes of all the heavenly host are watch-ing over you as a people, and alsoover all the world. This nation andall nations under heaven will beheld accountable for the deeds donein the body. We likewise shall beheld accountable for our acts and the course which we pursue. We have a long future before us—a longeternity. We are here upon a mis-sion, but it is short compared withwhat lies before us on the other sideof the vail. Let not your hearts betroubled; believe in God, keep Hiscommandments, and all will be well.The Lord will neither forsake younor His kingdom, but He will carryout all He has promised in the dayand generation in which we live. Have faith in Him and in His promises. Your strength lies in the God of heaven. Whatever you wantgo to Him for it. Our prayersshould ascend unto the ears of theLord day and night to sustain HisChurch and work among this people.There may be some strangers heretoday. I will repeat to all such whatJoseph Smith has taught us. He said, "If I was emperor of the world and had control over allthe human family, I would sus-tain every man, woman and child in the enjoyment of their re-ligion, let it be what it may." Those have been our sentiments all the way through. No man, not even emperor or king, no republic, nogovernment has a right to takeaway from any individual his agency in the enjoyment of his re-ligion. Why? Because menbeget only their own children; theydo not beget their subjects. They are responsible to God and not tomen. Every man, woman, and child, all parties, sects, and denomi-nations under heaven have a rightto their religion whatever it maybe. We claim that same privilegeas Latter-day Saints, we have doneso all the way through, and expectto do so as long as we live. We have a right to believe in God, to believein Prophets, in Apostles, in the Gos-pel which they taught, in the reve-lations of God and their fulfilment.I suppose we shall have an elec-tion tomorrow. Of course you know it is treason for an Apostle, for anElder, or a Prophet to refer to poli-tics. That is the way it is lookedupon by the world; but I would sayto the Latter-day Saints—those of you who go to the polls—labor forpeace; do not create any disturb-ance; and should any disturbanceoccur in this city, let it be with somebody else; do not let it be withthe Latter-day Saints. We do notwish to take the rights of any manaway, spiritually, temporally, politi-cally, or in any other capacity.Every man has a right to vote as he pleases, to pray as he pleases,to believe in God if he pleases,to renounce religion or to obeyit; because he is responsible to Godand not to his fellow-men with re-gard to his acts any further than hetrespasses upon those around him. I say, God bless you. Let us be trueand faithful. Zion will arise, theglory of God will rest upon her, theKingdom of God will be established upon earth.We expect to obey the laws of ourcountry until He comes whose rightit is to reign. We do not expect toset up any kingdom not to turn asidefrom those laws at all. We professto belong to the spiritual Kingdom ofGod which will be built up, and when Christ comes He will be theKing, and will reign not only overAmerica, but over all the earth. Great and mighty judgments awaitthis generation and will overtakethe people "as a thief in the night."Where are the governors, the judges,and the mobs that put to deathJoseph Smith and others? They arein the Spirit world. Where are thegovernors who have taken part in the matters of "Mormonism?" A great measure of them are in the Spirit world. We shall all followthem and meet with others whohave also gone before on the otherside of the vail. When we come tojudgment we shall be in anothersphere. We shall be where the laws of the land wherein we dwell todaydo not have jurisdiction, and presi-dents, rulers, governors, with our-selves, will then have to give an account of the deeds done in thebody.Let us be faithful to our country,to our God, to our religion, and tothose principles which God hasrevealed to us, which we have re-ceived, and which we know to betrue. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said hewas thankful to again have the privi-lege of meeting with the teachers andstudents of the Latter-day Saints' col-lege—with the sons and daughters ofZion raised in these mountains—on the occasion of their commencement exer-cises. He was a strong believer in theproverb that "Knowledge is power,"and also in the fact, as he himselfviewed it, that the character of a man or woman was formed betweenchildhood and the age of eighteenyears. We lived in an age when pres-idents, congressmen, governors and rulers sought to dissociate the Biblefrom the public schools. This was patent to the whole world in re-gard to our own nation. He wasthankful, however, that he had livedlong enough to see arrangements made, plans adopted, and schools es-tablished wherein the Bible, theGospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, theprinciples of life and salvation weretaught to the rising generation. Helooked upon geology as one of the mostimportant branches that could betaught, whether in Utah or any otherState or Territory. He regarded theyoung men and women before him as occupying a position different fromthose in any other part of the world.They were instructed in the Gospel ofthe Lord Jesus Christ in all its fulness,and those principles which were forthe exaltation and glory of thechildren of men. But upontheir shoulders a great respon-sibility rested, and it therefore be-hooved them to make good use of the advantages which they possessed. Thespeaker earnestly urged his hearers toimprove their time as far as possible,and seek to qualify themselves for theduties which would hereafter de-volve upon them. He felta great anxiety for the wel-fare of the sons and daughters ofZion, and he thanked God that theyhad already begun to lay the founda-tion for a bright future. After speak-ing of the necessity for extending thefacilities in the way of the students,President Woodruff expressed his greatpleasure at seeing the progress whichwas being made here and throughout the valleys of these mountains in edu-cational matters. He hoped and trust-ed that means would be grantedfor the establishing and increasing ofthose buildings in which the youngamong the Latter-day Saints weretaught, both in this city and else-where in the Territory. In conclusionthe speaker prayed that the blessing ofGod might rest upon all engaged in thegood work. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid the Primary, the Sabbath school, and the Mutual Improvement Associa-tion were the three institutions estab-lished in these mountain valleys toprepare and qualify the rising genera-tion for their labors for time and eter-nity. The responsibility restingupon our children was very great;their position in this respect was, in a great measure, different from the restof the world. They had been gatheredhere to the mountains of Israel andbecome associated with the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Their fathers had been called upon during the generation that had passedand gone to preach the Gospel to theinhabitants of the earth; and the chil-dren were required to follow in their footsteps. The Elders who had gone abroad to proclaim that Gospel hadbeen called largely from the mutualimprovement associations. He feltthat they were engaged in a great cause,and would say to the teachers in theseorganizations, male and female, "Youwill be blessed for what you have done." Let them not be discouraged or weary in well doing. As they sow-ed so would they reap. He hadwatched the progress of these institu-tions almost from their commence-ment, and the Lord would assuredlyreward those who labored in them.We had been informed by revelationthat whatever knowledge a man ob-tained by his diligence and persever-ance here in the flesh would remainwith him in the morning of the resur-rection. It would pay any man orwoman to treasure up wisdom and un-derstanding and do all the good he orshe could here; for we were on a mis-sion. He prayed that all those who wereengaged in this excellent cause would continue in their efforts, and seek toinduce others to become associatedwith them. He besought them to labor while the day lasts, for "the nightcometh when no man can work." 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFarose and said--I do not feel wellenough to make a speech, but I feelthat I ought to express a few of mythoughts on this occasion. I haveread the Old and the New Testament,the whole history of God's dealingswith the world, and I think that allthe men who have labored in the causeof truth have had the inspiration ofAlmighty God. There is no work thatGod has set His hand to do of moreimportance than His work in the lastdispensation of the fulness of times.And I think it has been by the inspira-tion of Almighty God that this cityhas been built and this Temple erected.And I believe it has been by the in-spiration of Almighty God thatBrother Maeser, Brother Talmage,Brother Young, and all the breth-ren have been moved uponin the performance of their labor.And on the same principle, I do notbelieve God has ever set His hand toperform a work without doing it. I think it will come to pass in theChurch School movement accordingto the desires of the brethren. Thestoring of the minds of the childrenwith true principles is by the inspira-tion of Almighty God. I think we shall have many schools and teachersdevoted to this labor, and they shallnot be hindered by the powers thathave operated against them in the past. I think God approves what has been done in these schools, and whatwe have done today has been by theinspiration of Almighty God.And I say to Brother Maeser, toBrother Talmage, and those who laborwith them, give heed to the wordof God, and He will bless youwith the necessaries of life. No-body can be engaged in a better cause. Thousands of Eldersgo to the nations of the earth to convertthe people there, and we have a greatarmy of children here upon whoseshoulders the great work of buildingup the Kingdom of God will rest.There could not be a better mission inthe world than that of training thesechildren. And I say, God bless you;and I will prophesy to you in the nameof the Lord that the people will soonsee the necessity of this work. Andas you pass along you will see thehand of the Lord in these things, forevery necessary thing for your prosper-ity will be provided. This blessing I pronounce upon you in the name ofthe Lord. Amen. 
 President Woodruff then arose and said:At the close of this meeting I would like to say a few words. I feel to re-turn thanks for and in behalf of thisassembly to Professor Eliot for hisshort but very interesting and import-ant lecture, or discourse, that he hasgiven unto us.There is not a word or sentimentpresented by him here tonight butwhat I could receive conscientiouslybefore God, and I think all Latter-day Saints and all former daysaints and all American citizens couldsay yea and amen to it, because it isfilled with principles of Americanism,of the spirit of the Constitution of the United States in the rights and liber-ties of every man, woman and childwho inherits this land.I am thankful that I have lived to see the day when I have been privil-eged to listen to such gentlemen fromabroad present to us such sentimentsas given here tonight. And Ihope the day is not far distant whenUtah may receive all these principles of liberty which are guaranteed by theConstitution of the United States andas they are enjoyed in Massachusetts.(Applause.)

 THE PRESS EXCURSION.Utah Editors Preparing to EntertainTheir Visiting Brethren of the Scissors and Quill.It begins to look now as though theUtah Press Association's invitation tothe editors of the Western States, tohold a convention in this city, next month, will be a bigger affair than wasat first expected, at least the favorableresponses A. B. Tomson, corresponding secretary of the U. P. A., is daily re-ceiving, give every indication suchwill be the case. Editors are sendingenthusiastic letters to Mr. Tomson,approving the idea of holding the con-vention, and expressing their pleasureon account of the opportunity affordedfor so grand a midsummer outing asthe editors are arranging. The belowextracts from correspondence received by secretary Tomson, indicate how well the idea takes outside of this Ter-ritory.Albert Tezler, secretary of the Ore-gon Press association, writes: "Your invitation to attend meeting in SaltLake accepted by unanimons vote atour annual meeting held in NewportJuly 20 24[t]h, and a delegation willvisit your fair city."The president of the Wisconsin as-sociation, John Neagle writes: "Can say that our trip to Salt Lake is assured.Your dates will suit us.

 THE GREAT PRESS ASSOCIATIONMEETING.The Utah Press Association is mak-ing arrangements to have a great meet-ing here the last days of next month.Invitations, we understand are beingsent out to all the immediate Statesand Territories, the intention being tohave such a representative gathering as will give marked importance to themeeting. Various subjects are to bediscussed, particular the law of libel,and other questions which directly con-cern the newspaper fraternity. Elab-orate preparations are also being madeto entertain these guests in a way tokeep up the old reputation of Salt LakeCity for hospitality. We think the citi-zens ought to take an interest in this, for every such meeting has a tendency to give more dignity to the journalisticprofession, to enable it to be of more useto the people. Good newspapers arethe greatest blessings that any commun-ity ever had. Their influence extends all through mens lives, and it is possible for a good newspaper to make all the community about it stronger and better.Modern newspapers came with the steamengine, the electric telegraph and thegreat advancements which have beenmade by the exploration of science. Itis an absolute necessity to the modernman and woman, and this being true,every effort to make it higher and noblerought to be supported and encouraged. We hope the Press Association will have a gathering such as that anticipated, and that the results of it will be only forgood.—Salt Lake Tribune.The Utah Press Association is makingarrangements for a conference of west-ern newspaper men in this city the latterpart of August. It is expected the con-ference will spread over several daysand will result in a western editors' fed-eration being formed, the special mission of which will be to secure theenacting by the legislatures of the west-ern states such laws in regard to libelas may relieve the fraternity from someof the injustices they now labor under. The visitors while here will be hand-somely entertained, and it is expectedtheir visit will prove a fine advertisementfor this territory.—Salt Lake Herald.
