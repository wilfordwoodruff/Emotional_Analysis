Lett me say that I am Exceding hapy to welcom Brother  Woodruff and those with him and to Render an account  of my stuardship to him as your Reprasentative and to harken  to his valuble council and to sustain him and the Quorum  in their arduious Duty that devolves upon you in the absence  of our mayrtyered prophet and patriarch who so nobly sealed  their testimony with their Blood. I would say that those  who accompanied Elder woodruff are sucesfuly laboring in  diferent parts of England and are much help to us in the  ministry the church in London is doing well under the teachings  of Elder E. H. Davis who follows in the foot steps of Elder L. D. Barnes  I have Recieved a letter from Elder Lea in France which says  he thinks that if some one could come there and preach the  gospel to the Native French in their own language that many  would Receive the truth. you no dout will see Elder [Lisleesyme]  Who wrote to me from Calutia and he will Be able to give you  more information Respecting that placee than I acan. He Left here   to go to Nauvoo last January—however I will Enclose his state-  ment in this letter, we providentialy Received today information  by a copy of a letter writen from J. Greenow from pitsburg that  he and his friends were sterotyping the Book of doctrines and  covenants there, and after their conference on the 6 of April he was  coming to England to as one of Rigdons Twelve Apostles to organize  a church and publish the doctrines and covenants and he Requested 
 G. S. L. City, July 12, 1859  4 p.m.    Bro. G. A. Smith,    As Brother Jaques has given you most   of the news, I will only write a few lines. The army   flour inspectors are condemning nearly all the flour   taken there under the Holliday contract. We cannot   ascertain what amount of forged drafts upon U. S.   were found upon in the possession of Brewer and   Mc Kenzie. Report says from $5000 to $500,000. Who   is connected with them in it? we have not learned.   When Col. Crossman found that Mc Kenzie had a hand   in it, he jumped up and down like a crazy man,   saying— "By —, we well make this stick on B. Y.   this time." Our lawyers will not go to Camp Floyd   to argue any case. Wilson says he thinks Cradle-  baugh and Sinclair will join issue against Bu-  chanan and Judge Black. If they do, the executive   of the nation must be in danger.    Sunday evening I met in council, at   the President's office, with the Twelve and about a dozen   from the south. Nothing special.    Stout and Blair are writing to the Governor their reasons   for not going to Camp Floyd. A brother, a Collier, I do   not know his name, has found a fine bed of coal on Chalk   Creek, on the Weber, about 10 miles from the mouth of   Echo Kanyon. There are three veins, one above another, each

 three feet thick. He has taken out some of the coal and   burnt it, and pronounces it of the very best kind. He   has made a contract to deliver 100 tons to President Young   at 20 dollars per ton. Sharpe is going out to   examine it. I think there is no mistake this   time.    Greeley called upon Dr. Bernhisel and said he would   accompany him to see President Young, but he has   not yet done it. He takes up his abode at Dot-  sons, in Whiskey street. He may become so whiskeyized   as not to go out of their channel.    O. P. Rockwell has captured Clark, the horse stealer,   who is now in the calaboose. The Probate court ad-  journed to day sine die. The people report no   potatoes set in this county. How is it south?   We have had quite a rain.    S. M.

 Great Salt Lake City U. T.   September 12th 1857    Brother Ilus, F Carter   Portland Maine.    I once more improve the opportunity of   addressing a few lines to you, and our Maine friends; but   when another opportunity will offer, I know not.    I will say we are all well, and all is still peace  in Utah, notwithstanding the armies of the United States   are approaching our borders with the intention of destroying   us as far as they can. I presume you are aware that   our mails have been stopped, and an enemy on the  way here to chastize us, and make Presbyterians of us   at the point of the sword.    We are certainly living in interesting times. As to   news I hardly know where to begin or end. It is universal   health and peace. We have gathered the greatest harvest   of wheat we have ever known in this Territory, and it is   so with every crop we have put in the earth. Our wheat   and oats was as high as my head; corn as stout as can   grow out of the earth, potatoes the best I ever saw, so with   all vegetables. Peach and apple trees are breaking down   under their loads; and on the top of this great harvest   we have a fair prospect of war with the United States.   This is certainly interesting, that the Government of the   United States, of Twenty five millions of people should   make war upon a little handful of people in the mountains 
 Historian's Office   Great Salt Lake City U. T.  Jan. 7th 1858.    Brother Ilus    Dear Sir,    As the California mail is about   to start, I feel to improve the opportunity of droping a   few lines to you. I must of course run the risk of its  ever reaching you. I wrote you a long letter by Docr  Bernhisel, which I trust you got. I then told you my  feelings, and our determinations with regard to submitting  any longer to the oppression of our enemies. The army  sent by the President of the United States, approached to  Fort Bridger one hundred and fifteen ^miles^ from this City,  and there stopped for the winter, the inhabitants of that  Country burned every thing to the ground at the approach of  the enemy; they burned up improvments worth about  $300,000 dollars and retired into Salt Lake County. The   army is now in Winter Quarters, we shall defend ourselves  as long as we can, then burn every thing and flee to the  Mountains; we all feel it to be more honorable to even loose  our lives in maintaining those rights and blessing  guaranteed unto us by the Constitution and Laws of our   Country, than to longer submit to tyranny, oppression and   religious persecution.    I forward you by this mail, three papers, one containing  Young's message, and our last issue of Jan. 6th, 1858.  also an extra containing our memorial to Congress  [ink faded] all the members of the Legislature, and also Govr. 
 a thousand miles from any body, because they are Mormons   and theirour religion differs from theirs in a measure, and   that too from the tales of liars and scoundrels, without   sending an Investigating Committee to prove whether the   tales are true or false; but upon the mere rumor of such   vagabonds as Drummond, have sent out an army of   2500 men to force us to do as they say.    You may ask what we will do? I will tell you   and all our friends what we shall do, and it is the only   thing we can do, and preserve ourselves, and that is to fight.  What, fight the United States? Yes, and all Hell, if   they come against us to destroy us. We have either got to   do this, or put ropes on our necks and walk out and say   'Gentlemen, will you please hang us,' and this we are not   disposed to do; we had rather die fighting for our lives,   liberties and rights, and defending the Constitution of   the United States, against a mob, even if this mob be   legalized by a town, city, county, state, or the nation   than to any longer bear the persecution we as a people   have had to pass through for the last 25 years. We are   determined to bear these things no longer, even if we are   opposed by the United States, or the world.    We have broken no law, either of God or man; the   Constitution and Laws of the United States guarantee unto   us all that we ever have asked for, and if they make   war upon us it is because of our religion, and the ungodly   persecution and treatment of our Government towards Utah   is too plainly manifest not to be mistaken.

 Returned all things are well in the Glasgow conference which Nos [numbers]   about 1065 members there was some trouble in Edinburgh  conference we Effected an amicablye settlement to all apearance  our General conference will Be held in Manchester on the 6th  of April. Brother Woodruff and Wife leaves tomorrow for  Manchester Brother Clarke and family are well Brothers  Holmes Sheets Straton and clarke were in the office yesterday  and are well. We all have Enough to occupy our time &  tallent. the pressent general conference will Be one of much  importance in Many instances, in all my travels I have  inquiered of the minds of the Saints about joining their  funds to const. Manufactorys in Nauvoo and I have found  the Saints all willing to Enter into arrangment on this  subject and the prospect at present is that we shall organize  a company of Saints with shares of one poun[d] each some will  Paid by instalments within one year some will take 50  shares and I think that by Next January a commity  apointed By the company can come to Nauvoo to commence  opperations with about 10 thousand pounds to be Laid  out in Nauvoo, without infringing upon the donations  towards the ^suport of the^ church it is proposed that the companey shall  out in con[c]ert with the companeys alredy Established in Nauvoo  in Building up the Kingdom of God and affording labor to  the poor saints on their arrival in that country.    I will forward to you a copy of the articals and the minutes  of the General conference at the Earliest oppertunity.    I shall Enclose to you an Extract from the Books in the office  showing the amount of money I have Received since I came  to the office and from what source and how Expended  that you may Judge whether I have done Right or wronge  if I have done wrong I will Rectify all Erors as far as I can  when shown to me. I have this to say that I have done the  Best I know how according to my cthe circumstances in  which I was placed. I do not think that I can Leave ^here^ before  next January for home. 
 God has set up his Church and Kingdom upon   the Earth: we are this Kingdom, God is with us, and this   is the reason why all hell is boiling over against us. The   Government has sent the most corrupt set of scoundrels to   rule over us that can be found on earth, and yet we   have treated them with kindness, and they have gone   away and lied about us as bad as they had power to   do.    You may laugh at the idea of our standing against   the United States if they come against us, but when they   fight against us they will fight against God, and they   will find it out before they get through with it; they will   find it worse than the Florida war, and they will want   to let out the job of killing the Mormons before they get   half through with it, and when this nation begins to   destroy any part of the the inhabitants for their religion   it will be a signal for the downfall of our Government,   and it is as sure to fall as there is a God in Israel.    Capt. Van Vliet, Asst. Quarter Master of the U. S Army   came in advance of the troops with 30 men as his body-  guard, to visit our city. He left all his men at Ham's   Fork, and came in with two of our brethren. He has been   here several days and has been kindly treated by the Governor   and all the people. Governor Young has told him all our  intentions and kept nothing back. He is satisfied that  we are belied and abused, and he will do all he can to  avert the impending storm.    I invited him to my house to day, and through my

I have sent you the true standing of the peanery  affairs of the office since I have been in it up to  the 8th of March. I shall continue to settle all the  affairs of the office Before I Leave and when I see you  I shall I shall Bring all the accounts with me  and will make all things Right.

 G. S. L. City  Feby 25, 1860    Messrs. Jacob Hamblin & William Crossby   Dear Sirs:    In behalf of the Deseret   Agricultaral and Manufacturing Society we respectfully   solicit you to visit the different settlements in   Washington county and lay before the people the   circular of the Society and also the accompanying  letter, and also to use your influence to   effect an organization of a county branch of the   D. A. & M. Society and incourage the people   to develop the necessary food and clothing as well  as the much desired luscious fruits of the earth.    Edw. Hunter  President   W. Woodruff  Geo. A.

 garden and orchard of 150 bearing apple and peach  trees, grape vineyard &c, and feasted him on peaches   and grapes. He will attend meeting tomorrow.    Governor Young fit him out with teams, and on   Monday he will start back to meet the Troops who are   now this side of Laramie. Dr J. M. Bernhisel goes back  with him to Washington.    The Captain is much pleased with the appearance  of things in this city, and greatly desires that a collision  may be avoided.    I will tell you plainly, Bro. Ilus, we have been   persecuted by various portions of the Government of the   United States, as long as we shall bear it, we shall not   let an Army come into this Territory for we know and   understand the motive and meaning in all these things;   we shall fight until we die, and if the worst comes to   worst, we shall lay waste every city in this Territory, and   burn every thing that is wood, to ashes, and flee to the   mountains, and hide our wives and children in the   caves and rocks, and our enemies will find the moun-  tains and kanyons and plains filled with warriors  for the next 25 years; they will lay waste our enemies   year by year, as often as they bring armies against us;   and the judjgements of our God will rest upon them as   a nation until they will have all the blood, war, calamity,   and woe that will be necessary to satisfy them, and also   to avenge the blood of the prophets.    We are determined in our plans, and by the help of 
 Historian's Office,   G. S. L. City, March 29, 1859.    Brother John Butler.    The history of the Galatin election riot, as   given in Mother Smith's History of Joseph Smith the Prophet,   page 221, is, I believe, incorrect. As you took a pro-  minent part in that affair you will confer a favour by   furnishing this office with a correct account of that trans-  action, it being the first blow struck by the mob to-  wards expelling the Saints from the State of Missouri.   Your early attention to this matter is desirable, as the   book is undergoing correction.    W. Woodruff 
 God we shall carry them out, so if they undertake to   wage a war of extermination against the 'Mormons' they   will find a war upon their hands which will be the   dearest one they have ever undertaken since they have   been a nation, for long before the United States of America   conquer the Almighty, kill 100,000 'Mormons', and 1,000,000  of Indians, and have to march 1000 miles over a   barren desert, through mountains and Kanyons to accom-  plish it, they will find themselves with an empty treasury   in the grave. But if they are determined to try it, let   them try it, and you watch the signs of the times, and   you will see where victory lies, you will find that the   victory is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift: but   I leave this subject.    Several of the Government baggage trains are in   our Territory, with nothing to protect them. Some 800  soldiers are on the way, this side of Laramie; where they   will winter I do not know, but it will not be this side   of the mountains.    We are making all the preparations for war we   can. There will not probably be any mails, but if   you can send me letters any how, do so as I would   like to hear from you. You can correspond with Dr   Bernhisel upon any matter while he is in Washington.   There are many things I would like to write, which I must  omit. Mrs Woodruff and the children are all well.

 Father Woodruff is well.    We, as a people, feel well, never better. Should   war drive us to leave our homes, and cut down our   orchards and go into the mountains it would ^be^ what is   called a sacrifice, and we would rather not be driven   to it, but we shall do it if necessity calls for it, and do the   best we can; but if it comes to this we shall go east next,   to settle in Jackson County Missouri, and build our   great Temple there, according to the revelations given unto   us through the Prophet Joseph in his day.    Remember us to Father Carter, and to all our   friends in Maine, and, could I speak to all the inhab-  itants of the United States, with one voice, even those that   are making war upon us, sending armies to destroy us,   laying plans in secret chambers to take our lives, or giving   consent to the shedding of our blood, to all such I would   say, we ask not for your sympathy or pity, but prepare   to weep for yourselves and your children, for as the Lord   God lives will his judgements rest upon you, and you  will as a nation be visited by thunders, lightnings, tempests  earthquakes, pestilence, famine, war and devouring fire.   Our nation is doomed to be rent asunder, and fall to   rise no more; the wicked will slay the wicked, and   they will soon have enough to attend to to take care   of their own lives without making war upon the 'Mormons.'  And I say, in the name of Jesus Christ these things are   at the door of the American nation, and there is far   more safety in Zion than in Babylon, for God will

Jack of $200. I shall  also have to ask you to excuse me  for the Mistake I made in not Enclosing  the Letter of A. M. Tinney I did not  know but I had sent it untill I  received your Letter last evening. I  will Enclosedse it in this. I will say that  that the 4 Marshals that Left Beaver that  were Expcted in St George have not made   their Appearacence in St George at all as yet.   they went to panquich and other side placs  I have at present a very comfortable cahamber  and am kindly treated by the family wha[r]e I   am. And I feel that I will be safe untill  thare is some move made in St George And as   soon as any house is visited it will be immediately

Brother Thompson is a   faithful man, & does all he can for the   underground work. He took me to S. L. City   and brought me back. Concerning my  family I will say that Emma is the   ownly one of my family who is in a situatattaonion  to Leave home, and she not permanently.

 Provo, Utah Co, Utah Territory  June 30 1858    Brother Lyman Wight    Your letter dated Mountain Valley Augt. 4 [18]57 has just arrived,  it has been detained from us by the Army of the United States, and it has very  fortunately survived the almost universal destruction of all our Mail matter, we regret  that we could not have received your history in season for publication; a sketch which  had been prepared you will see in the Deseret News, which is now published at  Fillmore, 100 miles from this City.    The brief sketch of the History of the Twelve, had been  forwarded to the Printers, they are only intended as a synopsis, leaving each of them  the opportunity to publish the same in full, at their leisure.    Your letter has been read to George A. Smith, Amasa Lyman,  Charles C. Rich, and your two nephews Stephen and Ephraim Wight, who are all present  while I am writing this.    We have ever entertained the warmest feelings for you personally,  and regret exceedingly that your course has led you from our midst; instead of  building up ourselves, we have labored as one man to build up the Kingdom of God:  you complain that Prest. Young used the pronoun I too much to suit you. He was  the President of the Twelve, and the quorum backed him up and sustained him, you   claiming more authority than the Eleven, went your own way, we regret the result  exceedingly: it was your duty not only to council with the Twelve, but to take their  counsel.    You refer to the revelation which says "it is my will t[h]at  my servant Lyman Wight shall continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness" &c  the spirit of meekness was the condition of the promise. "I will receive him unto myself" 
 L.D.S. Historian's Office,    P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, 188    I am Enjoying vay good health, at present  and feel in good spirits. If I live I shall  see my 80 Birth day the 1 March, 20 days  hence, but that figure looks vary strange  to me to think off. I can hardly comprehend  it. I do not feel that old, yet I suppose  it is so, when I look back to the days  of Kirtland & Joseph Smith and the Apostles   I feel almost alone, as almost all persons  that I was acquainted with thare are in the  Spirit World, president Taylor is almost   the ownly man ^living^ that I can think of that  I was acquainted with thare still thare  are a few living When I see so many passing  away I feel as though my time cannot be  far away but it is all right I would like  to be prepared when called I see from Letters  the "Loyal Leage" offer $2000 for the Presidency, and Gilsom  $500 for President Taylor, & $300 for Geo Q. Cannon. I will  say that Any Republican government Like the  United States who will seek thae destruction of  a Man Like president Taylor for keeping the command-  ments of God, A Man who has one been Murdered  & mingled his Blood with the prophets for the Gospls sake 
 whichwhich appears to us to be evidently wanting, when you declared in Nauvoo that you would not  turn your hand over to be one of the Twelve, and it seems to us impossible that you should  forget the caution of the Lord in the Book of Covenants in June 1831 "let my servant Lyman  Wight beware for Satan ^Brother Lyman^ desireth to sift him as chaff". Brother Lyman we ask you, to  think for a moment of the great promises made to men in ^an^ the foundation of Jany 1841 who  have fallen, or who have apostatized us and remember that all those promises are upon cond^it^ions  We will name Bennet the Lord promised to crown him with glory if he continued;  also George Miller is declared without guile, did he "continue"? William Lowe you remember  had great blessings in the same revelation, and the conditions of them all, that he continue  to observe the counsels of the Presidentcy. when Joseph was taken away, the Priesthood  continued with the quorum of the Twelve, with the fulness of the authority of the Priesthood,  and when you turned your heels against it, Satan had you in his [sive], and like chaff  you were blown away. Come back again, brother Lyman, and dwell in Zion, and  resume your duty enjoined upon you by the Lord, and preach for Zion in meekness, and  listen to the councils of the Presidency, the Church, and dare to arrogate to yourself  authority over your brethren. Brigham Young ordained you to the apostleship he was the  President of the quorum, and every member of that quorum whom Satan did not blow away  as chaff, have stood with and by him, and faced every storm with him, as you would  have done, if the light of the Spirit had been with you, "and he that gathereth not with us,  scattereth abroad".    Prest. Young by his persevering industry, untiring energy, and unexampled  faithfulness, has been enabled to gather the Saints into the mountains, to the very place that Joseph  had organized a company to explore: sent the Elders to almost every nation; translated the   book of Mormon, and the revelations into many languages, and published them to the four  quarters of the earth; and been enabled to defend the Saints from the unconstitutional aggressions  of our chief Magistrate. The God of Israel hath done [him] thus his servant Brigham, and  his faithful brethren who have stood by him while those who led away factions, have wasted  & are forgotten: many from your State and even some of your own posterity have found their way to Zion 
 Such a Nation ought to feel the wrath of  Almighty God, and be broaken in peaces, and the  sceptre any Government taken out of their hands  and given into the hands of rightous men  which will be the case as the Lord Loves, For No  Nation never did nor never can live longong  after persuing the course the United Stats are  doing today. I thank the Lord the presidency are  prsesevd ^preserved^ so far, and I hope & pray they may be  untill they behold Zion and her inhabitats  victorious and her Enemies cut down.  Brother Joseph F was quite sick the Last  I heard from him, with the Bronchitis & I  heard Brigham Discorse But you probably know more  of his condition thatn I do. I dreamed a week  ago that Lorenzo Snow was liberated by the  dcision of the Supreme Court of the U.S. I head  this morning that their decision Reversdd  the Decision of the Utah Courts. I will conferd  I had but vary little faith that the Supreme  Court would do any for us if thy could help it.  I trust to Brothr Cannon or Nutall to transld  translate my penmanship. Companies in the  Temple are increasing a good Deal of Late.  Remember me kindly to Brother Nuttall & all with  you. My Daily prayer is that you may be presevd by  the power of God from all your Enemies    I remain Your Brother in the Gospl W Woodruff

 Great Salt Lake City  March 8, 1859.    Col. Tho. L. Kane.    Dear Sir -- I am compiling the  history of our exodus from Nauvoo to these  valleys of the mountains in 1846.  This part  of the history of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latterday  Saints will be not only presented as one of the  most striking and prominient events in the dealings  of God with this people in their rise and progress, but  it will stand in bold relief as the main key of the  American history of the nineteenth century.    Closely intermingled with this conmemora-  ble history, which will be read with feelings of deep  interest by future generations, the name of Col. Thos.  L. Kane stands most prominent, not only as a  philanthropist, and one that made superhuman  exertions to dam up and roll back a mighty  flood of wrath, indignation, and persecution,  issuing forth from a powerful nation of twenty  millions of freemen, with the intention of anni-  hilating, at one fell swoop, thirty thousand men,  women, and children, because they had the  independence of mind to worship God according  to the dictates of their own consciences, and to  fulfil the destiny marked ^out^ for them by the God  of heaven, but as an instrument in the hands 
 since My return from  Detroit I Have felt that as soon as I could  get my Business & family straitened around so that  they would not suffer, that if My Brethren felt  the spirit that it was the Lord's will I would  be more than willing to be one of about five   Missionaries to go to the Yakies in Sonora  Mexico that same People that are or Have been  in trouble with the Mexicans & who are  of the same grade or inteligence as the Ysletas  now there are some reasons that to me seems good  that it is a proper time to open the door of the Gospell  to them, Amediately.    My experience in this  direction & with this Peopl is that they are very  strong Catholicks it Has been rooted & grounded  in them for ages together with the Power that the  Priests Have over them, thus forming as it were  an iron Band which up to date our Elders Have  found to be a very great Barier 
 You complain that Orson Hyde, W. W. Phelps and T. B. Marsh have been received into the  Church. Hyde and Phelps were received and endowed by Joseph Smith, and we have yet to learn that  even you objected to it in his life time. Marsh lived upon [fauks] for more a sco[r]e of years, and finally  wandered a miserable object of pity, poor, naked, destitute and disconsolate, and appeared befo[re] a  congregation of 8000 Saints, and humbly asked them to forgive him, and let him at least dwel in  our midst; they did forgive him, and permitted him to be baptized, and he remains a member,  a living, palsied, limping spectacle of the fruits of apostacy, had you have been in the midst of  Zion, he would have asked you, as he did all the Saints, to forgive him.    You remind us that in Jackson Co., in Zion's camp, and in Caldwell, you were  called upon to lead the Armies of Israel, when they were surrounded by their enemies, the  hosts of hell; the reason you was called upon was, you was at your post, then, you was there  in the midst of Israel, valiant in the testimony of Jesus and the defence of Israel; but when the  tremendous power of one great man James Buchanan goaded on by the clamor of the people, was hurling his legions  upon the Children of Zion, ^to crush from the Earth, the Priesthood;^ and when the nerve of every faint hearted member trembled to the center,  and the bloody war cry was reiterated from every corner of Christendom "wipe out Mormonism",  where was its old defender? was he in the midst of the trouble; was he the foremost to  defend the innocent; to lift the Standard of Zion; to face the monster; fearless, and   determined to encourage the Saints in the dread encounter? or was he reclining at his  ease in the sunny plains of the far famed Elysium of bliss, Texas, writing to me and   my Brethren the Twelve, as if in bitter irony "I thought you was too popular to think  of an old codger like me."    You was cut off from the Church in the latter part of 1848, the subject  was brought up on the receipt of a pamphlet which you published against the  Authorities of the Church.    Brother Lyman come home to Zion, mingle in our midst, confess  and forsake your sins, and do right, as we and all men have to do, in order to enjoy  the favor of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and have fellowship with the Saints,  then, and not 'till then, will your path be lit up so that you can walk in safety, 
 2  of God, and inspired by him, to turn away,   in 1858, the edge of the sword, and save the effu-  sion of much blood, performing what the combined  wisdom of the nation could not accomplish, and  changing the whole face of affairs, the effects of  which will remain forever. Your name will of  necessity stand associated with the history of this  people for years to come, whatever may be their  destiny. As a historian I am in duty bound  to write the truth & record the facts, and, as the first  compilation of our history at present falls upon  me, I feel [all] the necessity of communicating  with you upon this subject. We have on file  your letters to [us &] communications with the leaders  of this people, [com]mencing while we were on our  pilgrimage in the wilderness, and continuing  more or less up to this day. We have also  copies of some letters to you from your worthy, noble,  and honored father, breathing forth nothing  but the inspirations of a great and good  heart, and good will tow[ar]ds an oppressed  people. We have also letters from the War Depart-  ment and other sources, for our good, [and ] which  were originated through your infl[uence.] These  we wish to record upon our jour[nals for preserva-]  tion. We also desire to publish, in our history [to]  the world, all matters appertaining to or conn[ec] 
 This Yakie Nation are not now under  this Catholic Youke & they are exibiting  a firm determination not to be subjugated  to their Mexican neighbors but we Know that  they must & will submit ere long as their  numbers will not warrant them against the  Goverment of Mexico or even Sonora    it seems to me that 5 good Elders could  make a start in that direction begining with  or at the line as they enter Mexico or Sonora  taking up their labors among the Mexicans as  opprortunity & doors were opened to them  Moving quietly & constantly towards the  Yakies Nation which last named place would  be the Principle object in view togather with  other viliges & smaller Lamenitestowns  that may Have Broken off in years Past & Have  lived for ^so^ many years seperated that they Have  lost all recollection of any Kindred ties 
 and be filled with the power of God, and the fire of Zion burn in your bosom,  until that time you will not be in a situation to build up Zion & defend her  interests. We all feel interested in your welfare; you have no enemies here; the  longer you stay away from us, the more alienated your feelings become; the Lord  dwells in Zion; His Spirit and power is in our midst: He has delivered us and  given us the victory up to the present day, and we acknowledge his hand in all   these things.    Brothers G. A. Smith, A. Lyman, C. C. Rich and your nephews Ephraim  and Stephen Wight, all wish to be remembered to you with the best of feelings:  we all respect you for you gallant course in defending your brethren against their  persecutors in times past, and trust that the day is not far distant when we  may again see you a humble man, with your brethren in Zion building up the  Kingdom of God.    We shall be pleased to receive a letter from you at any time.    Yours truly    W. Woodruff 
 with us, which we deem to be of interest, as far as  wisdom and prudence dictate. Any matters  which should not be made public we wish to preserve  upon our words.    Now, my dear Sir, I write to ask your  consent to our wording in our history your visits  with us, your labors, services, and benefits bestowed  upon us as a people, commencing with the organ-  iration of the Mormon Battalion in 1866, and con-  tinuing to the present time, and hencweforth and  forever, though as far as the feeble efforts of a his-  torian are concerned, they are but a poor reward for  the benefits received. We would like also to publish  your corespondence, as we advance in the dates, and  some letters from your father (God bless him! he posessed  a noble soul), one bearing date Aug. 18, and the  other Sep. 4, 1846. His letters contain nothing  but good will to an afflicted people, and great  anxiety for his son, who was sick in our midst.  We wll endeavour to use prudence in anything we  print. Nothing of our history goes to press until  it has been thoroughly inspected by President B.  Young. Please drop me a note upon this  subject at your convenience, and you will much  oblige me.    I feel thankful that the Lord watched over  you and preserved you through all the dangers 
 I trust that you will not feel that I am  forward in this Matter as I Have been taught that  it was the liberty of an Elder to offer himself  I will remember being Present when Pres-Young  said that if the Elders Knew their duties that instead  of him being compelled to call & ask & beg for some-  one to Perform Missions that they would be at his   elbow awaiting & sugesting to him    I will only add that this Has been upon  My Mind in such a Manner that I Have been  compelled to call your attention to the above  facts & I trust that you will give it some reflection.    The next subject is one that came up  when you was with Me in New Mexico & at  My House.    you will remember that you  said to me that you thought it better for Me not  to add any More to My Family at least for the   Present as it mite destroy the Happiness that  existed with us & that seemed to be permanent 
 [imminent]  to your visit to us in 1858, and your  return home, where you have again the privilege   of enjoying the society of your dear wife, children,  and friends. Should it ever be the will of the   Lord for you to visit us again, I hope it will be   under circumstances more favorable to your [own]  comfort and care, than them [illegible]  with   your last visit: I am sure there is not a  man in the world, who would be [illegible] with   mine joy, or a [tribe] to our territory, than our   friend and benefactor, [Mr.] Kane. The greetings  of heart and [illegible] of Mrs. Kane, and the sacrifices  she made, in encouraging and awaiting her [term] -  [farriers]  to undertake a [leery] and [illegible] a journey  to aid in delivering a[ illegible] [feasible] from   the [illegible] of war, has often been a [lofris] of [cere]-  [duration] in the [initial] [winter] of the ladies of [Leaniat].    President Young & Council, the Twelve, and  the people in general are well. Geo. A. Smith has  gone to Provo to attend the court of Judge [Gradle]-  [laugh]. All is peace and quietness throughout this  [illegible] at [illegible]. We have had a hard winter, steady  cold or strong weather, with a great deal of snow in the  mountains and nearly a foot in the village. The   army is rather too much [illegible] with the people, or too near   them. The tribes are taking [pamfliers] of [some] [illegible] re -  [illegible] by the people, hiking [illegible] [illegible] , and handing [Louis] [illegible] [illegible].    Your [illegible]  W.

 Historians's Office.  G. S. L. City, Sept. 2nd. 1858.    Elder W. W. Phelps    Dr Bro:    We recieved your note of Sept 11th.  complaining of a [putissers] in the history of Lyman  Wight, that he considered [joisy] transgression for   selling land in Jackson Co.    We would be very sorry to publish any thing  that is not correct, and especially to injure the char-  acter or feelings of any of our brethren, but the History  of Joseph Smith Feby. 5th, 1858 stresses that "Elder  Lyman Wight stated, that he considered all other accu-  sations of minor importance compared to their selling  their lands in Jackson county; that they (Phelps and  Whitmer) had set an example which all the Saints were  liable to follow. He said that it was a hellish principle,  and that they had flatly denied the faith in so doing."    Now, whether the fact was so, or not, is not the   point at issue, but the above shows that Lyman  considered it was so, and that is all that is stated;  and as this history was compiled while you were  one of the Historians, we consider the written authority  sufficient reason for our declining to publish a contradic-  tion of the statement and particularly as it now leaves  "Lyman to lie on his own hook."

This However Has been no ones fault   but it is attributable to Bad Health on the Part   of the Loving Wife.    I am advancing  in years but this does not take away the desire  to Have a Posterity sufficiently numerous  to be well remembered, so much so that My  name will never be blotted out of the great register  in the Kingdom of our God.    owing to what you said to me as above stated  I Have refused chances that May Have Proved  a blessings to Me, & since My return Home  I Have felt that if agreeable to My Brethren  and the Lord would open the way I would  add at least one More to My self  and at the same time do some work in the Temple  for friends.

 Great Salt Lake City, Utah T.  August 22, 1860.    Brother Zera S. Cole.    Your letter of May 10, per Geo. W.  Russell, has come to hand. We sympathize  with you in your long tarry in the midst of  hostile enemies. We were glad to hear from  you, and we would advise you to shake off  the ague, fever, and kindred diseases, get  your handcart, horse cart, ox cart, or cow cart, &  start towards the setting sun, in search of  light, health, & Zion's friends. The star of  Zion has been in the ascendency all the time.  though dark & threatening clouds have frequently ob-  scured the view. As they approach this high moun-  tainous country, it seems to break them up.  We are glad to hear from you as an old comrade  in Zion's Camp, many of whom have gone  to their rest. We fear you lack courage &  Energy, and we wish to encourage you to  gather with the Saints. The glorious land  which you now inhabit is ours when vile  corrupt men cease to rule it. Here is the  place for the Saints to shelter themselves in the cham-  bers of the mountains, where the Lord has made  springs in the desert, thereby causing the thirsty

I Have recieved a  letter from Bro E. Snow requesting me to  come to Mexico & Bring at least Part of My family  you will Know My sensitive organization  and I well Know that Bro snow was formerly  quite severe in his relations with his Brethren  besides this I Have allways been & felt fearfull  that if Bro Snow should ever Have cause to  talk Hard to me, that it would allmost ruin Me  but my Brethren toll me that Bro Snow Has changed  very much, & at the same time I Hope I Have learnd  something & am more Humble—More willing to endure  the trials of the day but I wish to hear from you about ^it^    remember Me Kindly to Brethren & friends  Your Bro    A M Tenny    dirict to StJohns Apache Co.

 land to bloom with reeds and rushes, while the  great desert and mountain desolation which  surround us, afford a shelter against our ene-  mies, which is more impenetrable than the walls  of a fortress. Our settlements extend north-  wardly one hundred and ten miles and  southeasterly three hundred and thirty miles,  the whole country being a desert, except those  little spots that are rendered green by the springs  from the mountains. It is frequently forty or  fifty miles between settlements, though generally  they are from six to twenty miles apart. You  complain of drouth. We have drouth here every  summer. Unless Congress pass some act by  which the springs in the mountains are dried up,  we shall be able to water our fe fields, whether it  rains or not, only provided the Lord sends plenty  of snow on the mountains. But Paul may  plant and Apollos water, yet the Lord alone can  give the increase. The cares which rest upon  President Brigham Young and his counsellors are  immense, but the Lord gives them wisdom  to foresee the evils and warn the Saints to pre-  pare for them. The course of Zion is  onward. Come, brother Zera, and  cast in your mite. We have an  abundant harvest of wheat throughout

Good or  bearer, and, signed by "S. Rigeion, President" and "-.-. Smith Jr.,  Cashier" This note is pronounced genuine by one Mr.  W. E. Skinner of Boston, and the party sending it to us expresses  a desire to dispose of it, and thinking that perhaps you or some  of the officers of the Church might be interested in seeing the  note we have taken the liberty of writing you on the subject, rather  than to call upon you not knowing if you would be interested in  it and not desiring to take up your time with a matter which may  not interest you.    If you should desire to see the note we will be pleased to  send it to you for examination or to have you call at the bank if  you should prefer, and any expressionof your pleasure in regard to   the note will receive our respectful attention.

 I feel it my duty to propagate  the truth as this is the Church   of the Latter day Saints, & my   benighted countrymen.  I believe for the purpose of   carrying out the work I   will badly need cooperation  both spiritual as well as   temporal. May I trouble  you to let me know if the   help of Israel could be afforded.  I should certainly have   preferred to take on hand  the work without call for   temporal aid, but as I am  strickly forbidden in govern-  ment employ to undertake  anything religious, I shall  be obliged to give up my 
 Provo Utah Feb 11th 1895    Dear Brother:    You mentioned in one of your letters, that the  fact, that when a person receives the Gospel, that he receives  no rest or satisfaction only as he is engaged in spreading  the good word among our father's children, and in calling  them to flee from the wrath to come, is to you "another telling  link in the chain of evidence of the correctness of the latter-  day work," is no daubt correct, and it called to my  mind some of my experience while in the church in my  early youth, and some of my experience after I had drifted  away.    As you and myself have been on terms of intimacy for  some time, I felt that I would like to write you as to  some of these experiences I have stated above, because they  are largely the external witnesses that helped to fasten  in my breast the "assurance of faith" that I now enjoy  of the correctness and divinity of the mission of Joseph  Smith, and the "latter day work."    My first connection with the church was in England  while a mere boy, but young as I was, I now look back 
 Jones & Schroeder,  Lawyers,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    December 2, 1895.    Gentlemen:    I am preparing an article for publication con-  cerning the subject matter of the enclosed interrogatories.  Wishing to tell the whole truth and without doing an in-  justice to any one I have prepared the questions herewith  submitted and respectfully request an early reply. It is my  intention to use these questions and your reply as a part  of the proposed article.    Trusting that upon my return to the city which  will be within a very few days, I will find your answer  awaiting me, I am,    Yours respectfully  A. T. Schroeder    To,  Wilford Woodruff,  George Q. Cannon,  Joseph F. Smith,    The First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints. 
 present situation  My immediate and ultimate   resolve is to be a proper ordained   missionary for Hindustan  but as you may also see  this impracticable just  now, the rules not admitting  of it, I must be content  to work as a lay missionary.  I have some adherents  but the different the opions   they are serving is a great  deal in their way of honest  thinking.    There I may just briefly   state that though for 34  years of my life I have been   a Presbyterian, I have never   ceased to hanker for some  thing not completed. 
 and remember with what joy and satisfaction my faith in  the gospel gave me. I have attended testimony meetings with  my father where the spirit of the Lord was so strongly diffused,  that I have felt as though I was in the presence of God  Himself. My feelings have been so buoyant, so light, that  it seemed as though I was walking on air; and when  I retired to rest at night, with that calm, that "Heavenly  frame," surrounding me,—yes, entirely enveloping me—I  have been led to exclaim "Surely goodness and mercy will  follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in  the house of the Lord forever."    After I left Utah, my father and mother went to England  and I remained in Kansas. My faith remained strong for  a good while, in fact I never denied the faith, but my  surroundings were such that I drifted away, and the good  spirit I enjoyed left me. When I came out of the Army  in 1864 my relatives and friends were nearly all Presbyterians,  I had donated a sum of money to help build a church  and the Pastor wished me to be one of the board of Trustees,  to which I consented, but later requested me to allow  my name to go on the church books. To this I did not

 at first consent to, largely on the ground that I did not un-  derstand the full import of the Confession of Faith. After  some importunity on the part of my relatives, I consented  provided I should not be required to subscribe to the Con-  fession of Faith, which the Pastor and the "Lession" consented  to. I became a Presbyterian in that way, my only baptism  (except when a child by the church of England) being that I  received when I first became a Latter day Saint.    Becoming involved in political controversy, I gave  very little attention to theological subjects, and for some  time I went along quite smoothly. Later along I began  to give the subject some thought, but the moment I began  to think, to study and enquire, that moment I became  uneasy, and doubts and fears would encompass me  about until I was really unhappy. I attended prayer   meetings, but found no comfort.    In the town in which I resided there existed quite an  atheistic, an infidel element, which caused me to begin a  metaphysical investigation. I read Spencer Tindal,  in fact both sides, but landed in the Theistical school,  and began to combat the other side. 
 1— Q. I invite your attention to an Epistle of President S. W.  Richards as reported in Vol. 14 of the Millennial Star at page  259, which reads as follows: "It is the duty of every  officer in the Kingdom of God to turn his heart, his feelings  and his affections to his President, and as you seek after the  spirit of the Lord to enable you to do his will, so with the  same fervency of soul seek after the spirit and the will of  your President to do the same with all lowliness of heart."    Permit me to ask you whether or not you do not now believe  and teach in accordance with the above doctrine? If you no  longer believe in that doctrine, when and where has any modi-  fication of it ever been published?    1— A. 
 This diverted my attention for a year or two, but finding  I could not give the requisite time to a full investigation, I   was compelled to drop it. The time however that I had  given the subject, caused me to investigate the faith that  I was supposed to defend. I began on predestination,  but it staggered me. The question that confronted me, stared  me in the facte, disturbed my sleep at night, and my thoughts  by day, was. "Am I one of the elect?" How shall I determine  this question. I went to my Pastor I laid my condition   before him. I asked him for some assurance. He told  me to "go to the Lord in prayer." He would preach the  eternal sufferings of the damned, a suffering, a torment  so terrible, that when the mind would attempt to calculate  its duration, and would figure on the countless ages  of eternity as they rolled along, and passed beyond our  conception, then this suffering, this agony had just  begun. It is difficult for me to express my feel-  ings. It occassionally occurred to me of the infinite  satisfaction I had in my early days, and I would  say to myself  "O! that I could feel that way now."    Do what I may, I got no releif. If any one was in

 2— Q. In Vol. 5 of the Journal of Discourses at page 209 it is  said, "Jesus Christ is the head of the church and he got a  man to represent him on earth, namely Brigham Young. Jesus  Christ is still the head of the church and his will to men on  earth will be known by means of the mouth piece of God the  Prophet and Seer." Do you not believe and teach this to be  true, holding that President Wilford Woodruff as the successor  to Brigham Young enjoys the same gift? If not, when was the   privilege of the mouth piece of God curtailed in this re-  spect?    2— A. 
 a "slough of despond" as Bunyan describes, that one was  me. In 1886 I was taken quite sick, and my physicians ad-  vised me to take a trip to the mountains. When I was able to  travel I came to Salt Lake City. The next sunday I went to  the tabernacle. They sung "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning,"  and Bishop Whitney preached. While I sat there some very  strange sensations came over me. The long ago came be-  fore my eyes, and I thought "How strange."    When I left my home in Kansas I intended to return, but  strange as it may appear I am here yet.    Being out of the church, what part I took in political mat-  ters, was necessarilly with the Liberal party, but while I so  acted I think every one will hear me witness that I never de-  nounced a "Mormon." I alway would say to myself, "that is  the faith my father died in," and I know he was honest.    In 1890 I began a thorough investigation of theological  matters. My mind was drifting towards "Mormonism." I  determined to satisfy myself, and it was that which caused  me in February 1892 to write the letter I did withdrawing  from the Liberal party.    The more I thought, the more I became convinced that 
 3— Q. I invite your attention to page 795 of Vol. 21 of the  Mil. Star where it was reported that God, by means of a revela-  tion to Hyrum Smith, directed the saints as to which candidate  for congress to vote for? Do you not still believe that God,  through his mouth piece, may still express a political prefer-  ence, and do you not still believe it possible and even  probable that God through the present Prophet has a right to  direct the saints as to his choice between political candidates  for civil office?    If not, when was this privilege withdrawn from earth?    3— A.

 the latter day work as established by Joseph Smith was the work of  God, and finally that the path of duty required me to become  reunited with the church. Of course I forsaw what would  follow. I knew that contumely would be heaped upon me. I  knew that the finger of scorn would follow me. I knew that social  ostracism would come, but I determined to take the step, and  leave the consequences with my God. And with that step came  peace of mind, tranquility of soul, and I feel to exclaim  "I know that my Redeemer lives." The assurance of faith that  for so long I sought for, but never found, today I have,  and enjoy. The despair I encountered as a Presbyterian,  today is changed to a joyous hope of a glorious immortality,  and that if I endure to the end, if I prove faithful, that I  shall gain the crown of glory, shall regain the presence of my  Heavenly Father, and dwell with hHim in His eternal Kingdom  "Worlds without end"    I have written you quite a lengthy letter. I hope it will not prove  tedious. The subject is interesting to me, which I suppose makes  me think it ought to be to everyone.    With my best wishes. From Your Brother in the Gospel    A. Saxey 
 4— Q. Vol. 1 Journal of Discourses page 161, in which Heber C.  Kimball speaks of Brigham Young has this: "If Brother Brig-  ham tells me to do anything it is the same as though the Lord  told me to do it. This is the course for you and every other  saint to take."    Substituting Wilford Woodruff in place of Brother Brig-  ham do you not still believe and teach the saints that doc-  trine? And does it not apply with equal force to all temporal  as well as to religious affairs? If not, when and where has  it ever been limited or qualified?    4— A.

 5— Q. In the Deseret News of July 1, 1857, is contained a dis-  cussion by Sydney Rigdon in which he says: "When God sets up  a system of revelation, he sets up a system of government.  When I speak of government I mean what I say. I mean a govern-  ment that shall rule both temporal and spiritual affairs." Is   not this still true? Being true do not your people understand  that you have the right to guide and rule in political  affairs?    5— A.

 7— Q. President Woodruff is reported to have spoken in Box  Elder County at a conference held there October 25, 1891, in  part, as follows: "The Latter Day Saints throughout all  Israel should understand that the First Presidency of the  Church and the Twelve Apostles are led and guided by the in-  struction of the Lord, and the Lord will not permit me or any  other man to lead the people astray."    Do you not still hold the same views, and is it not right  to accept this teaching literally?    7— A.

 10— Q. I invite your attention farther to the December (1894)  number of the Juvenile Instructor in which edition (one of  your number) asserts substantially that you and other members  of the priesthood cannot be criticised or spoken lightly of  without grieving the spirit of God. Is this not a claim that  you must be held above criticism by members of your church  and that criticising members will be punished by a loss of the  spirit of God?    10— A. 
 Merthyr Tydfil Jany. 2nd, 1846.    My Dear Bro. Woodruff,    Judging by yr former cau^r^se of devotedness to, and wellwishes for  the best interests of the Welsh Saints, ^nation^ methinks t'wil be interesting to hear  of their present prosperity & future prospects; this interesting topic has merited a place  in the bosom of the Prophets & Apostles of this dispensation to some extend, it was our  favorite theme in the Western climes; and now, those glorious anticipations which  we fondly cherished for many a sweet hour while pacing the Deck, at the still hours  of ^the^ midnight watch, are being realised beyond my expectations; in fulfilment of the  predictions of our beloved prophet e'er I started on this mission & e'er his exit to the abode of bliss.  Bro. Henshaw & myself, after we parted with you at Manchester, bent our course   through Woolverampton & Birgmingham, were we met the Saints in good spirits, all  alive for the "Joint Stock Co." realising as Father Crook told them ^that^ their life & atc  depended on its success: here we parted with our beloved Bro. Davies of London  and proceeded in Co with Bro. Heliday to Bristol, being too late for the Packet, met  with the Saints next day (Sunday) introduced their new Sheperd to them, congratulated  them on their happy union, preached to them about the new Gospel, alias Joint Stock Co. and  Bro. Heliday & Henshaw edified them much judging by their union & love; then the  former left for Bath, the latter and myself next mor'g for Cardiff, thence by Railway home  & found all well. The Saints have rented a large Hall here in Merthyr, much larger than  the one that the Saints meet in, at Manchester; in this, -- held a Meeting on Christmas  day, -- by the by, this reminds me to wish you a happy New  Year, also to Sister Woodruff  & family.  The object of the meeting was to explain to the Saints & others, that the banish  ment of the Saints from Nauvoo, was so far from being the downfall of Mormonism  and the last of Zion, & the gathering, as the Priests of Baal & newspapers Editors prophecy  that the reverse is precisely the case, tis another "Arcemedis lever," to propel Mormonism  over the snowy clifts of ^the^ Rocky Mountain; tis another nail in the coffins of scoffers,  and lay^ing^ another corner stone in Zion. poor folks, their little hearts are shut up in nutshells,  the Saints rejoiced to understand the superiority of Zion over Nauvoo, and their desire is to  reach there. Sunday Held a conference in the same Hall, representing 18 branches  all in a healthy and thriving conditions, showing an increase of about 200, since last  April, about half of that no. in this branch alone, & making in all about 600 Saints in  Wales, & nearly all of the pure stock of Ancient Britons, & yet these are but the first  fruits of the "hosts of [Eomer] from the sides of the North," and judging by the daily increase  tis well you go & prepare a place for the glorious Co. that will be, in "The fields of the woods"  were else than California will afford us our lgenght & breadth of consecrated ground?  Were you in our Saints' meeting in ^the^ the afternoon to see the love & union of the Welsh  Saints, you'd rejoise to see a double portion of the Same Spirit cementing those of diffrent  nations, (speaking alternately, Welsh & English) as children of one family in the bonds of one covenant  11 being confirmed and 9 children blessed, the Sacremant administered while every countenance  glistened with joy, & every eye moistened with a tear of gratitude to one filial Parent of all. 
 Manti City Feby 27, 1852.    Dear Bro Woodruff,    Circumstances beyond my control  urge me to propose to you to let me  have some shoe leather, for I actually cant  get any here by any means; & I much need it.  I have heard that you are coming through here  in the spring en route for the south, I have had  intimations that your humble servant will  have your company, barefoot or shod, but  be that as it may I propose paying you for  what leather you will let me have in flour, butter,  cheese or any thing else which I may have; or if,  you dont come this way, I will send such things  to you there. If possible favor me with the above  by the bearer Bro. Pecktol.    With many kind sentiments of regard for yourself  for the sake of old times, & scenes gone by besides  many anticipations of future acquaintance, my-  self & family send our kind respects to yourself, to  Sister Woodruff & family also to Bro. Hardy & family    Respectfuly  Yr. Bro. &c  D Jones    P. S. A line or two would much oblige &c. 
 11— Q. Can you deny that the right of the church leaders to  dictate to the members of the church in all temporal affairs  has been taught by members of the First Presidency and the  Quorum of the Twelve, since the manifesto was issued?    11— A.

 I then in Welsh showed to the Saints, the nessesity of faithfully warning our own  nation & trying to save them e'er tis too late, that the harvest truly is great, and already  white for the harvest^reapers^ and the laborers are but few, that we ought to spread the  Gospel by every lawful means in the course of this season, from this Nursery to the remotest  parts of Cambria's hills, and proposed that more Officers shd. be called and ordained such as  wd. be faithful, sealous & wise, to go two by two, Elder & Priest together, through every County in  the Principality as soon as practicable; that the Saints shd. sustain them with their prayers  until their voices echo from the mountain tops to the deepest glens of our Father land   and ^till^ the fulness of the everlasting Gospel shd. be heard in this dispensation of the fulness of   times in every secluded abode of our much loved brethren. Bro Henshaw in English  followed in a very warm and pathetic address, & visetted the same upon every heart  that I believe every Saints in the place, not only responded with ^a^ hearty Amen, but  were willing & anxcious to be up & doing all they could for the acompleshment of  so glorious an object. The evening meeting was ocupied by several of the Elders  in Welsh & English alternately, testifying of the great and wonderful works  of God in the age of the world & each one seemed to be filled with the Spirit of their  office, the Hall was crowded with anxcious hearers, many acknowledged the  power of the truth, three were babtised that night, making 7 during the Conference  Monday at 10 Saints met for buissness -- when I in Welsh followed by Bro  Henshaw in English & others showed the different duties of different Officers, the  absolute nessesity of a concentration of efforts to success -- and also the danger of hiding  a talent when given to Officer or member, that all could act for good in their sphere &c  thence called out, & ordained 4 Elders, 19 Priests, 9 Teachers, 6 Deacons, and advised  them to prepare to go out when their circumstances wd. permit, all to a man rejoiced  in the honor of his Office & pledged their fidelity to the cause. Twas agreed on, that  all the Oficers shd. meet once a week to instruct each other in all things nessesary  the no of Officers before were 10 Elders, 10 Priests, 8 Teachers & 7 Deacons, Total now  in Wales are 14 Elders, 31 Priests, 17 Teachers, 13 Deacons, in all 76. then organised three  new branches & the meeting closed to give room for a another scenery, &  judging by the busy move of a myriad of the fair, the music of the China  by the base of the trays, the laurels, evergreens & flowers to adarn the Hall  youd have thought twas a preparation for a splendid tea party, however  I was not left long in doubt, for ocular demostrations like tables  well set & lined, amounts to facts you know, yes a picture this  not of fancy, but of real life, long to be remembered, a type of the "feast   of fat things, of wines on the lees," which shall be, on Mount Zion.    I have been informed that some 400 cards were sold previous to the time  and perhaps twice the number partook of the feast, the Co. was as respectable  in apearance, conduct, & circumstances as any tea party of the times: and  I had ample proof that it was the means of doing good in various ways, all the  preposessed prejudices of the guests gave way before it, many of the Sectarians and some  of the Priests I was informed came through the Hall to see our "liberty," and the more the  better, for we had a specimen of that worthy of their admiration. I overheard convers  ation like the following on the right & left. "These must be a good & a loving people." "These  cannot be guilty of the charges prefered against them by our preachers." I will be babtised e'er I go home." 
 Supreme Court,  Judges Chambers,    Norwich, New York, September 30, 18895.    Sir:    In a letter written in 1832 it is stated that King Follett  and his wife Louisa had joined The Mormon Church. In a letter  written some years later it is stated that he had removed to Utah  and had become an Elder of that Church. I am quite anxious to  find out whether he left any descendants. If the records of The  Church show that he and his wife were members, and also disclose  whether he was an Elder or not, I should be greatly pleased to be  informed of the fact. I should also be glad to learn the date  of his death, as well as whether he left descendants. I am very  respectfully,    Yours truly,  David L. Follett    To the President or Secretary of  The Mormon Church,  Salt Lake City, Utah.

Tooele City, ^Lake View^ Utah, Feby 17 1895    Hon Wilford Woodruff President  of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints.    Dear Brother    I am in receipt   of yours of Jany 30th 1895 stating  that my name had been suggested  and acepted as a missionary to Great  Britain, and if I had no reasonable  obstacles, to be prepared to leave Salt   Lake City March 24 1895.    If I am correctly informed an Elder  going on a mission has to defray is  own expenses from here to his field of  labor and provid for himself while  on his mission, my finances being in such  a condition it would be impossable for  me to meet the expense incured in going  on a mission while I have som little means  it is so tied up as prevents me being able 
 and many similar expressions of astonishment & admiration, saluted my ears  amid the social chat of the lively throng. some were babtised during the meeting, others  after meeting, & it really seems as tho shaking among the armies of the alians, and   that e'er long they will flock in solid phalanx to the Standard of Mormonism,—happy day.—  when the Tables were cleared and the Hall crowded I addressed them in English followed  by two Welsh Elders & Bro Henshaw about the "Restoration of all things spoken  by all the Holy prophets since the world began." The motto over the Stage, "Peace, Union  and brotherly love," was a good introduction to the subject, altho this subject is rather  new here, it met the almost universal aprobation, and cheered up the hope of the  Saints in delightful anticipation of the happy day when the lamb & the lion shall lie  down together &c, when peace, love & union shall universaly prevail, and nothing, an  imate or inanimate (if such there be) shall hurt or destroy in all the holy Mount.  May it be the happy lot of all the Saints, to enjoy such a portion of these three great, and   darling principles of heaven, as was manifested in this meeting is my desire. then they wd. be happy  But Dr. Bro, I hope you'l not get tired reading this long letter, for I have not done yet, next  comes something about a theme if possible more interesting at the present crisis than  the old ones, I mean to say that last night we held a meeting to advocate the "Joint  Stock Co." you'l say that we are fond of vanities, who is not if these be a fair specim[en] [page torn]  but the result was that almost all think well of it. & you know get ^where^ I get tal [page torn]  about California & thereabouts, I feel as tho ^I^ was on the quarter Deck again, an[d] [page torn]  my old stamping grounds. I read them the rules of Society in Welsh, and they pass'd a note  to have them published in Welsh, so ask Bro. Ward if he will please send me the last with  amendments, and any other inf[or]mation about it, for the Welsh are hot for that, like all  other good topics, send also when leave we can collect the Cash & all about it. &c&c.    Some 95 shares were taken besides upwards of 80 previously taken. So now I must close  by saying go ahead Mormonism with thy colors nailed to the mast head, success to the "Joint   Stock," till its ships shall meet auspiscious ^breeses^ to fill their sails, blow high, blow low, in  every clime, DrBr. Woodruff adieu, ^altho^ you return & leave me behind, May Neptune's hoots,  Vanecuard yr. Westward course, & Eden's breeses waft you home in peace.    Yr Bro in Christ D Jones.    NB. privately to Br W.  Will give my respects to Bro Hedlock, Ward & Wilson, will they favor me by sending   some American papers here [to] me at Bro.

I shd. be pleased if you wd. send me a better authorising  me to collect what I can from the Welsh Saints on ac&c. to enable me to bring out another  pamphlet now, in answer to one now just out by the joint stock of Priests, just such another as   "Mormonism Unveiled" tho' in Welsh, published in this place, if it is not answered some week  saints & sinners may stumbl at it please advise on that, and also for the benefit & peace of Br H,  what position I hold now, in relation to Wales, wether I have authority to organise or ^other^ Conferences,  than Merthyr & Wrexham, wither all those delegates shd. come to Manchester from all parts or wether we  hold a general conference ^here^ & one from there represent all others at Manchester, for we might by & by have many  delegates there who could not understand a word of English. some hints about these things & others from you would  preserve peace in the family, if I prophesy aright;—I am yr affectionate Bro D Jones.

 Plain City Utah  July 6 1895    Dear Bro Woodruph:    As time is precious   and money scarce I will try to express  by pen what I would otherwise like  to express verbaly to you. I was ten  years ago offered a large sum to travil and  lecture on the Light and Darkness of Utah at  that time I refused for reasons stated.    Six years ago I thought some of getting  up a lecture and wrote down a few items  apostle Richards thought them not  aproproiate so I gave it up for that time,  but I have always felt I had a duty to  preform in trying to help clear away the  shadow my father Wm Hickman helped  to cast upon our people-for east west

I was educated in a convent whare my   talent both in composing and elocution was  much commended- but as I have for ten  years been out of society and away from edication  I feel rusty and incapiable of preparing  my lecture in proper style- so I send it  to you first to look over and see what  should be left out or inserted, then I  would like you to glive it to someone or  refer me to someone who is caipable  of preparing is in the best styl of language.

Dear Sir; A friend of mine was in our office  a few days since, and saw a few leaves of the original  copy of the Mormaon Bible, which was taken from under   the cornor stone of the old temple at Nauvoo. He was   considerably interested in the relic, and suggested that  I write you regarding same, and that perhaps you would  like to own it. The relic came into my possession  some years ago through one of our salesmen who happened   to be in Nauvoo about the time the corner stone was   removed, and an old citizen of the place had possession  of this relic, and for a small consideration furnished  the few pages which are now in my office. The relic  is now in a frame and covered by glass, and should you  desire to own it I think it would be best to box it  carefully and ship it in the frame.    Mr. Jos. Bull of your city is personally acquainted   with the writer, and should you wish to know anything  further in regard to this matter kindly refer to him.    Yours very truly,   Jas. L. Lee

Some years ago, while in the South, I  compiled a compendium of the preinciples of the  gosple, to my own ideas, according to the instruc-  tions of Bro Roberts. In it I simply gave the  porport of the passages, in as concise language  as possible, and just enough argument to  throw one who ^had^ already perused "oOrson pPratts"  Works" on to the thread of argument.    Owning in a printing office here, and having  partly learned the traid, I have been getting  the work up in lessons for the eElders Quorum  over which I priside, and hearing one of  our lately returned missionaries suggest that  a small book of referances would be a treat  to Elders. I concluded to add the references  to the work, And submit it to you brethren  to see if you would allow me to put it  on the market. I enclose a few pages of

 Riverton Oct 12th, 1895    Pres. Woodruff   and Council.    Dear Brethern    When the Devision on national   Party lines ^came^ I understood by   reading the papers that   the people were at liberty   to join Ether of the parties,   according to there own convictions.   I also understood that that we   were at liberty to accept any   possion that the people   bestow upon us,   being nominated for the   Lower House. In the next   Legislature I accepted  beleaving I was doing my   duty, I did not realise   I had neglected any duty 
 the work which will give you some idea of  it. I estimate that the matter will make about  100 pages, which will be sold at about 25¢  in common binding. One hundred pages of  this type will hold a great amount of matter.    The main thing clained is the size, but the  few lines of arguments thrown in between  the passages to refresh the mind, and lead the  learner to understand what point to make in  a certain passage is also a matter worth  mentioning in my mind.    The subjects I have written out are  "The fall of man", "The Atonement of Christ"  "Faith" including the personality of God, or the  person in whome we should have faith. "Repentance"  "Baptism" "Spirit of Good" or Holy Ghost.  "Devine authority", "New revelation", "Evidences of  the Bible and Book of Mormon Compared"  "Pass over or Sacrament" "Gathering of Israel"  "Scattering of Israel"  "Apostacy"  "Retoration"  "Organization" "Redemption of the dead" "Plurality of wives  not unscriptirial" 
 untill I heard the remarks   of Pres. Joseph F. Smith   on Monday last at conferance   I would be pleased to   know if it is Desired and   proper that I Should   decline said nomination,   for my gereatest desire   is to Honor those that   Preside over me.    Trusting to have an   Earley reply, I remain   your Brother    O. P. Miller 
 Dear Bro. Woodruff, Kanesville Nov. 11th 1848.    Your letter from Long Island  was nice this evening, and I hasten to Say  to you that you should have written to Orson Pratt  the Same Statements that you have written to me.   He is the presiding officer of the Church in England,  and Littlefield, it appears, has returned there and  is under Bro. Pratts immediate jurisdiction.    Such conduct as he is guilty of to all appea[rances],  should be Sufficient to cause his immediate ex-  communication from the Church, and let him  labor with his hands for his support, and return  to this place if he has any desire to be Saved.  If you have written to bro. Pratt concerning him  all will be well; but if you have not, I wish  you to do so, and add my Sayings to your letter.    Bro. Oliver Cowdry has assisted me to put up  my press to day. Hase has returned here with his  family—made his satisfaction to the Church and  has been voted to the rec'd by baptism. I expect  to baptize him tomorrow. I hope to get my paper  out this Month and Shall forward it to you  immediately thereafter. With regard to any particular  trouble here, I have no fears at present. Still,  I do not know what the Devil and wicked men  may do. I am in the house of the Lord and so  are they. His will be done. I have not acted 
 If a person could be appointed to whom  I could send proofs to insh insure no  doctrinal errors going through I should appre-  ciate it.    If this could be done I should like to have it  as soon as possible, as I will need my type to  keep ahead of my lessons in the quorom.    I will come down at any  time, if you think it ecessary, and show you  all the manuscript.    Very Respectifully  Lamoni Call.    I see no reason why bro. Call should not  have full liberty to publish his little work and let  it stand on its own mirits. He, of course to do the  work at his own expense and risk. I would  suggest that President Hess & Grant would  be good judges of its soundness in doctrine, and  that Bro. Call submit the proofs to them, and if they  are doubful of any point they could rifer it to  the High Councel or to the Presidency, or one of the  Apostles-as they found most convenient. J. F. S.

Babbitt's falsehoods and   misrepresentations will be the cause of it. Let this  be had in remembrance by all the Saints.    A long letter is due to you from me, but  time will Not allow me to write much. I hope to  be able to Speak with a thousand tongues by and   by. We are all well, & good news from the valley.

 Liverpool Dec 15 1848    To Pres. Woodruff    Dear Bro   Your kind letter   written last Spring came duly to hand, & livin I learnt   your address, I have frequently wished to make a   written acknowledgement of your kindness as soon as a   convienent opportunity should present. I have been   obliged to cease my labors in the Office, through a productive   illness; but I have never lost sight of your kindness both   to me & my family; and I hope hereafter to honor your   memory for the same. My illness was caused by too long   confinement to the Star office; this produced indigestion and   consumption followed by piles of a very painful nature.   But through the earnest faith of the Saints I am now   pretty well restored to health. I have been travelling   for near two months past among the Conferences   preaching & stirring up the church to pay their   tithing. I feel encouraged to believe that I shall   gather a pretty good sum for the temple. There are   several saints expecting soon to come into prosperation   of large sums of money, before I sail for America.   From them (4 persons) I hope to receive several   thousand pounds as tithing to gladden the hearts of   the saints in the valley.

I had a   conversation with Prs. Cannon and  Snow in regard to this, when they   were here in Mantua, and they granted  me this priviledge; should there  be any change in date of going to  Eurupe from athat of going to the Southern  States, please inform me, otherwise   I will be in Salt Lake City the 13th   of July, the appointed time.    your Brother, P.

 The additions to the Brittish Churches continue to be   increasing by great, but the emigration falls   much short of the inonase, and the general inquriy   is, how shall we be gathered to zion. Some ten or   fifteen hundred, will probably emigrate near the   first of Feb. next, including several hundred from   Wales with Capt Jones. But what are there among   so many? Eld. Pratt estimates that 300 ships   would barely suffice to carry the Brittish Saints to   Zion at this time.    The hopes of the wicked   concerning better times for Trade & business seem   to be perishing. And the popular bias now is   that every man should sieze as much spoil as   possible, either by fair means or by foul.    Governments are seized with the same mania   and the whole platform of people is like a   is like a troubled sea the papal Crown has at length   fallen.

But the Saints were were very bold and   with their warning voice in much assurance  and in the Holy Ghost. It is truly delightful

 to see them pushing the sestarian Churches and   demolishing human creeds as so much hay and   stumble. The weak are becoming strong and   the gentiles marvel. You would be astonished   to see the issue of Books Stars and Fuents from the   Star office every fortnight. The issue of Stars   has nearly doubled since I took charge in "47"   and the inneased issue of other works is in equal   ratio. The line of truth sells irresistibly through   the land. There will soon be some very   efficient preachers in the French Nation from   these parts. We also have a Hindoo in this   Country that speaks more than a dozen different   languages, Arabic etc etc, who is preparing to go   into Asia to preach the gospel soon.    I expect to sail for New York the last of Jany,   next & go from there to the Bluffs & the valley to my   dear children & the Saints. I may take a steerage   passage in a steemer.

 Elder W. Woodruff:-- The founding   of this kingdom cost sorrow and blood.  In our family circles we remember the  men who founded it, and we prize those   who have laid down their lives for this  work. God has given us other men to   lead us, and they are as dear to us as   our former prophets were. We should  prize their instructions, and we should  live in that way that we can have com-  munion with God to sustain ourselves  as Elders, Bishops, Presidents, etc. If   we are without the light of the gospel of  Christ, and do not live in it, we shall  become like other men. It is necessary  for us to grow in faith, wisdom, confi-  dence, prudence, and in all the things   of God, that we may understand in a   measure His providences towards us;  and that He has a motive in every visi-  tation we may receive from His hands,  in sending frost, snow and storms, by  which the works of our hands are des-  troyed, or of any other kind. We felt  it hard to leave our temple in Nauvoo,  but we have enjoyed a great deliverance;  and should a prophet tell of the events  of the next ten years we should not  believe him any more than we would  have believed Joseph if he had told us  all we have passed through since we   left Nauvoo. The Lord has only just   begun to deal with the people. The  judgments of the Lord will follow one  after another, until His work is accom-  plished in the last days. God will visit   the wicked of this generation with  famine and pestilence, fire and smoke,   with earthquakes and a great destruc-  tion. We are called to stand in these  mountains amid the crash of nations  and the wail of millions. How shall  we do this? By being [s]anctified before  God. We have to watch as well as  pray. We must be honest men and  women, and walk uprightly before the  Lord, or these mountains will not hide  us from the judgments of God. Faith-  fulness is required of all the people,   from the Prophet and the Twelve   Apostles to the least member. Faith-  fulness in all things is the condition on  which we can continue to enjoy our   possessions in these mountains. We   must overcome sin in the world and in  ourselves, and learn to sanctify our-  selves that we may be saved. When  we are faithful, we are faithful for our-  selves. God has attained His exalta-  tion, and all that He has blessed us  with is for our salvation. Our eternal   destiny depends upon the course we  take in this short life. If our eyes were  opened to this fact we would not sell  our souls for a mess of pottage. The  counsels we now receive are as precious  and of as much interest to us as were  the counsels of Joseph and his brethren   in the early days of this church. If   we give our hearts to love the things of   this world and neglect our duties we  cannot overcome, but we will be over-  come, whereas, if we are faithful, no  power will prevail against us.

I can assure you that I am  farr from being unhappy or discontented with my lot but on  the contrary feel quite calm & perfectly at home in my elements &  can truly say that the Lord has been with us uppon our Journey  and we seemed to be helped on and hurried along by the spirit all  the way & I believe performed the Journy in less time then any of the   Elders have done before. I feel that we left Salt Lake about the right   time and landed in Liverpool about the right time & I do not know  any thing but what all things is well with us at present at any  rate we feel that we left home with the blessing of our brother  on our heads and still have their prayers & feel that we shall knewd  them in future before we see you again in the flesh you will  recollect that we left on the 24th of Sept and we landed on the missourie  Nov 3 making the trip across the plains in 40 days no accident occured  other then the Shyene Indians stole six of our animals at   the south fork  of Platt four of them mules belonging to Br O Hide & about the same no  number failed and were traded of at the several trading posts or left  & among them the animal you let Br John Harby have. At Kaynesville we  spent above one week during which time Br Hide called a conference  and we all attended and spoke to the saints & endeavoured to inspire  them with the spirit of gathering which seemed to put new life into them  all Here we met a Br Russell who had been sent out from England  as an agent for a company who are engaged in gitting up the machinery  for the manufactory of sugar from the sugar beat superintended by Br  John Tailor in France from him we learned that a ship load of Saints  would sail from Liverpool for orleans about the first of Jan accordingly  uppon reciving this information Br O Hide & E T Benson advised that  myself A O Smoot & Samuel Richards should if possible reach England before   the ship should leave we therefore accompanied with Br V Shirtliff and  ^J D Grant Jedediah M Grant^ load the stage and went to St Joseph where we learned that the steamer  Elpasso had just left the landing containing those ^officers^ fugitives from Justice  we therefore hired a couple of veacles and rod in the night to Weston  where we steped on board and found ourselves in the presence of those  Great dignitaries and accompanied them to St Louis. The passengers   on board petitioned them for a speech but they never so much as peeped  publickly in our presence.

 Elder W. Woodruff: We say we meet  together to worship the Lord and to do  a great many things for Him; but we   meet together for our own benefit. The  Lord has obtained His glory and we   have not; and He has placed us in this   life to obtain our exaltation. This is  what we are striving to obtain, and   why we meet to worship God. I do not  know that we can do anything for the  Lord, only to be obedient to His will;  and if we are obedient it is for our own  benefit. When we build school-houses  and meeting-houses, it is for ourselves  we build them. If we plant orchards  and vineyards they are for ourselves;  and all we do in the great work of God  in these last days is to obtain salvation  in the presence of the Lord. If we are  counseled to cease from evil, it is for  our own benefit. We have offered the   nations the gospel and they have re-  jected it. Does it injure us? No; it  injures them; for they are under con-  demnation for refusing that which is  for their own good. We have embraced  the gospel, and we are blessed with  peace and comfort and consolation; we   have had the benefit of it in this life  and it will bestow upon us eternal life  in the world to come. You cannot  make a wicked man happy by giving   him property and riches. There is no  people on the earth that enjoys so much   happiness as we do. We have had hard  labor, and with it the spirit of peace,   and we rejoice in the principles of eter-  nal life. Our minds change as do the  appearance of our faces. If we had a   picture of our minds, as they were a   few years ago, and were to compare it  with them now we would see a decided  advancement in knowledge.    We have been taught by our early   traditions that the Lord has nothing to  do with temporal things. This is a   mistake. The world and its fulness are  all temporal; and the Lord made them.  This is a temporal kingdom, and must   occupy a power on the earth. When-  ever a Bishop is placed over a people,  and he enjoys the spirit of his calling,  his counsels to that people will be right;  and the people should sustain that man,  and they will be blessed in so doing.  Pres. Young has labored for years to  get the people to have a correct under-  standing with regard to temporal things.   We have formerly sold our grain for  naught; but within the last year or two  it has been worth something; and if we  would be counseled in all things we  would be blessed more abundantly,  temporally and spiritually; and this  course would lead us to the possession  of eternal life. 
 Elder W. Woodruff: The question  may be asked, "What object has our   President in visiting this people every   year?"  It is to prepare the Saints for   the Lord to rule over them; and the   devil is preparing the wicked for des-  truction. Look abroad and see the   great events that have taken place since   Joseph Smith was sent with the full-  ness of the gospel to the world. See   the great change that has taken place  in our nation. It is painful for us to   reflect on the increase of crime. It   seems that all civilization is departing  from the world; but the Lord has said   "I will rule over my Saints," and the  kingdom shall be the Lord's. We can  all see the necessity of the instructions   which we receive from His servants,   day by day. They are given to prepare   us that the devil may not have domin-  ion over us. A Latter-day Saint who   lives his religion sees the kingdom of   God going forth; he can understand the  signs of the times, and will live by the   principles that are taught unto us, and   he will see the advantage of building   up this kingdom. The wicked do not   see this. They are not quickened by the   same spirit which quickens you. The   Spirit of god is withdrawn from them,  and they are groping in darkness and   are being prepared for the damnation of   hell. They permit the devil to govern   them, and they are given over to his   power; but the Lord will take care of   His Saints. We all expect to have an   inheritance on this earth; then why   not begin to improve the earth and   make it beautiful, and sanctify our-  selves and the earth? The Spirit of   God is with us; the same Spirit that was  in Abraham and in all the ancient   fathers, to whom promises were made   and from whom a royal seed has des-  cended; we have the same Spirit in us,   and a like work to perform. The speak-  er gave an account of Abraham's des-  troying the gods of his fathers, reason-  ing that as the Lord had sustained him   in his righteousness, so would He sus-  tain us in the performance of like   works.

 LECTURE AND READING ROOMS.—The   first free lecture, under the auspices of the  Library, Reading Room and Lecture Asso-  ciation, took place last night, in Morgan's  Commercial College building, in the 14th   Ward. The subject of the lecture was:    "Libraries and Reading Rooms;" the lec  turer on the occasion was Hon. Wilford   Woodruff, who, after singing and prayer,  gave a very interesting lecture on the sub  ject. He mentioned the interest he felt in   the wellfare of this people, particularly in  their intellectual welfare; quoted a passage  from the Doctrine and Covenants, con-  cerning the acquisition of knowledge from  all good books; recommended reading his-  tory; private means, as a general thing, was  insufficient to establish a suitable library,   even for family use, and hence the advan-  tage of free reading rooms, giving the pub-  lic access to the daily papers, and telegrams  from the whole world. The reading room   does much to draw the mind of youth from  the vortex of "civilization" so-called.   Mentioned his own personal experience,  and the profit he had derived from read-  ing travels, history and scientific works;  also President Smith's excellent memory   gained by cultivation. Advised the people  to contribute books and means to the  library, and to improve their leisure time   in treasuring up knowledge, especially of  the rise and progress of this people and their  remarkable history. Wished the under-  taking success; encouraged the committee   to go forward in their work. The library   will be an advantage to both old and young.   Advised the keeping of a personal journal,  and spoke of its interest to generations com-  ing.  Said that an education was the best  legacy, and that novels lead the mind astray;  useful books vice versa. Closed by saying   that the acquisition of knowledge is of  slow growth and the result of patient labor. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    said he was thankful for the privi-  lege of meeting with so many of  the Latter-day Saints upon that oc-  casion. He had not been able dur-  ing the last four or five months to  speak in public, having been af-  flicted with a cold on his lungs.    One very peculiar fact was that  God the Creator of heaven and  earth and the inhabitants thereof  had always been an unpopular Be-  ing with the world. The Gospel of  Jesus Christ whenever taught by  inspired men, in any age, had  met with a great deal of op-  position. Such had been the  case in the whole history of the  world, from the time of father Adam  down to the present. Having shown  from Bible history how nations as  well as individuals had been pun-  ished for disobedience to God and  His commandments, President  Woodruff continued: I say to all  Israel and the whole world today  that the God of heaven has set His   hand to perform this work in which  we are engaged. He has raised   up a Prophet who organized   this Church in fulfilment of  the records of divine truth. Joseph  Smith was no more popular in the  generation in which he lived, neither  are the Apostles nor the Latter-day  Saints as a body now, than was   Christ and His Apostles in their   day. But the God of heaven has  decreed certain things, and those  decrees He will carry out, whether  men believe or disbelieve. He will   establish His Church, He will estab-  lish His Zion, He will bring together  His people. The people have to be   gathered from all nations under  heaven or the Bible will be unful-  filled.    We are passing through a very   peculiar kind of history. We have  had a peculiar history all the days  of our lives—ever since we have   been members of this Church at   least; we shall probably continue to  have until the coming of the Son of  Man. No man can be godly, true,  and a faithful witness of the Lord  Jesus Christ without suffering perse-  cution and meeting with opposition.  This has been the history of  the world in every age.   Be faithful, do what is  right, and let the consequences fol-  low. Trust in the God of heaven.   He is watching over you; the eyes   of all the heavenly host are watch-  ing over you as a people, and also  over all the world. This nation and  all nations under heaven will be  held accountable for the deeds done  in the body. We likewise shall be  held accountable for our acts and   the course which we pursue. We   have a long future before us—a long  eternity. We are here upon a mis-  sion, but it is short compared with  what lies before us on the other side  of the vail. Let not your hearts be  troubled; believe in God, keep His  commandments, and all will be well.  The Lord will neither forsake you  nor His kingdom, but He will carry  out all He has promised in the day  and generation in which we live.   Have faith in Him and in His   promises. Your strength lies in the   God of heaven. Whatever you want  go to Him for it. Our prayers  should ascend unto the ears of the  Lord day and night to sustain His  Church and work among this people.    There may be some strangers here  today. I will repeat to all such what  Joseph Smith has taught us. He   said, "If I was emperor of the   world and had control over all  the human family, I would sus-  tain every man, woman and   child in the enjoyment of their re-  ligion, let it be what it may." Those   have been our sentiments all the   way through. No man, not even   emperor or king, no republic, no  government has a right to take  away from any individual his   agency in the enjoyment of his re-  ligion. Why? Because men  beget only their own children; they  do not beget their subjects. They   are responsible to God and not to  men. Every man, woman, and   child, all parties, sects, and denomi-  nations under heaven have a right  to their religion whatever it may  be. We claim that same privilege  as Latter-day Saints, we have done  so all the way through, and expect  to do so as long as we live. We have   a right to believe in God, to believe  in Prophets, in Apostles, in the Gos-  pel which they taught, in the reve-  lations of God and their fulfilment.    I suppose we shall have an elec-  tion tomorrow. Of course you know   it is treason for an Apostle, for an  Elder, or a Prophet to refer to poli-  tics. That is the way it is looked  upon by the world; but I would say  to the Latter-day Saints—those of   you who go to the polls—labor for  peace; do not create any disturb-  ance; and should any disturbance  occur in this city, let it be with   somebody else; do not let it be with  the Latter-day Saints. We do not  wish to take the rights of any man  away, spiritually, temporally, politi-  cally, or in any other capacity.  Every man has a right to vote as   he pleases, to pray as he pleases,  to believe in God if he pleases,  to renounce religion or to obey  it; because he is responsible to God  and not to his fellow-men with re-  gard to his acts any further than he  trespasses upon those around him. I   say, God bless you. Let us be true  and faithful. Zion will arise, the  glory of God will rest upon her, the  Kingdom of God will be established   upon earth.    We expect to obey the laws of our  country until He comes whose right  it is to reign. We do not expect to  set up any kingdom not to turn aside  from those laws at all. We profess  to belong to the spiritual Kingdom of  God which will be built up, and   when Christ comes He will be the  King, and will reign not only over  America, but over all the earth.   Great and mighty judgments await  this generation and will overtake  the people "as a thief in the night."  Where are the governors, the judges,  and the mobs that put to death  Joseph Smith and others? They are  in the Spirit world. Where are the  governors who have taken part in   the matters of "Mormonism?" A   great measure of them are in the   Spirit world. We shall all follow  them and meet with others who  have also gone before on the other  side of the vail. When we come to  judgment we shall be in another  sphere. We shall be where the laws   of the land wherein we dwell today  do not have jurisdiction, and presi-  dents, rulers, governors, with our-  selves, will then have to give an   account of the deeds done in the  body.    Let us be faithful to our country,  to our God, to our religion, and to  those principles which God has  revealed to us, which we have re-  ceived, and which we know to be  true. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said he  was thankful to again have the privi-  lege of meeting with the teachers and  students of the Latter-day Saints' col-  lege—with the sons and daughters of  Zion raised in these mountains—on the   occasion of their commencement exer-  cises. He was a strong believer in the  proverb that "Knowledge is power,"  and also in the fact, as he himself  viewed it, that the character of a   man or woman was formed between  childhood and the age of eighteen  years. We lived in an age when pres-  idents, congressmen, governors and   rulers sought to dissociate the Bible  from the public schools. This   was patent to the whole world in re-  gard to our own nation. He was  thankful, however, that he had lived  long enough to see arrangements   made, plans adopted, and schools es-  tablished wherein the Bible, the  Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the  principles of life and salvation were  taught to the rising generation. He  looked upon geology as one of the most  important branches that could be  taught, whether in Utah or any other  State or Territory. He regarded the  young men and women before him as   occupying a position different from  those in any other part of the world.  They were instructed in the Gospel of  the Lord Jesus Christ in all its fulness,  and those principles which were for  the exaltation and glory of the  children of men. But upon  their shoulders a great respon-  sibility rested, and it therefore be-  hooved them to make good use of the   advantages which they possessed. The  speaker earnestly urged his hearers to  improve their time as far as possible,  and seek to qualify themselves for the  duties which would hereafter de-  volve upon them. He felt  a great anxiety for the wel-  fare of the sons and daughters of  Zion, and he thanked God that they  had already begun to lay the founda-  tion for a bright future. After speak-  ing of the necessity for extending the  facilities in the way of the students,  President Woodruff expressed his great  pleasure at seeing the progress which  was being made here and throughout   the valleys of these mountains in edu-  cational matters. He hoped and trust-  ed that means would be granted  for the establishing and increasing of  those buildings in which the young  among the Latter-day Saints were  taught, both in this city and else-  where in the Territory. In conclusion  the speaker prayed that the blessing of  God might rest upon all engaged in the  good work. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    said the Primary, the Sabbath school,   and the Mutual Improvement Associa-  tion were the three institutions estab-  lished in these mountain valleys to  prepare and qualify the rising genera-  tion for their labors for time and eter-  nity. The responsibility resting  upon our children was very great;  their position in this respect was, in a   great measure, different from the rest  of the world. They had been gathered  here to the mountains of Israel and  become associated with the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Their fathers had been called upon   during the generation that had passed  and gone to preach the Gospel to the  inhabitants of the earth; and the chil-  dren were required to follow in their   footsteps. The Elders who had gone   abroad to proclaim that Gospel had  been called largely from the mutual  improvement associations. He felt  that they were engaged in a great cause,  and would say to the teachers in these  organizations, male and female, "You  will be blessed for what you have   done." Let them not be discouraged   or weary in well doing. As they sow-  ed so would they reap. He had  watched the progress of these institu-  tions almost from their commence-  ment, and the Lord would assuredly  reward those who labored in them.  We had been informed by revelation  that whatever knowledge a man ob-  tained by his diligence and persever-  ance here in the flesh would remain  with him in the morning of the resur-  rection. It would pay any man or  woman to treasure up wisdom and un-  derstanding and do all the good he or  she could here; for we were on a mis-  sion. He prayed that all those who were  engaged in this excellent cause would   continue in their efforts, and seek to  induce others to become associated  with them. He besought them to labor   while the day lasts, for "the night  cometh when no man can work." 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  arose and said--I do not feel well  enough to make a speech, but I feel  that I ought to express a few of my  thoughts on this occasion. I have  read the Old and the New Testament,  the whole history of God's dealings  with the world, and I think that all  the men who have labored in the cause  of truth have had the inspiration of  Almighty God. There is no work that  God has set His hand to do of more  importance than His work in the last  dispensation of the fulness of times.  And I think it has been by the inspira-  tion of Almighty God that this city  has been built and this Temple erected.  And I believe it has been by the in-  spiration of Almighty God that  Brother Maeser, Brother Talmage,  Brother Young, and all the breth-  ren have been moved upon  in the performance of their labor.  And on the same principle, I do not  believe God has ever set His hand to  perform a work without doing it. I   think it will come to pass in the  Church School movement according  to the desires of the brethren. The  storing of the minds of the children  with true principles is by the inspira-  tion of Almighty God. I think we   shall have many schools and teachers  devoted to this labor, and they shall  not be hindered by the powers that  have operated against them in the   past. I think God approves what has   been done in these schools, and what  we have done today has been by the  inspiration of Almighty God.    And I say to Brother Maeser, to  Brother Talmage, and those who labor  with them, give heed to the word  of God, and He will bless you  with the necessaries of life. No-  body can be engaged in a   better cause. Thousands of Elders  go to the nations of the earth to convert  the people there, and we have a great  army of children here upon whose  shoulders the great work of building  up the Kingdom of God will rest.  There could not be a better mission in  the world than that of training these  children. And I say, God bless you;  and I will prophesy to you in the name  of the Lord that the people will soon  see the necessity of this work. And  as you pass along you will see the  hand of the Lord in these things, for  every necessary thing for your prosper-  ity will be provided. This blessing I   pronounce upon you in the name of  the Lord. Amen. 
 President Woodruff then arose and   said:    At the close of this meeting I would   like to say a few words. I feel to re-  turn thanks for and in behalf of this  assembly to Professor Eliot for his  short but very interesting and import-  ant lecture, or discourse, that he has  given unto us.    There is not a word or sentiment  presented by him here tonight but  what I could receive conscientiously  before God, and I think all Latter-  day Saints and all former day  saints and all American citizens could  say yea and amen to it, because it is  filled with principles of Americanism,  of the spirit of the Constitution of the   United States in the rights and liber-  ties of every man, woman and child  who inherits this land.    I am thankful that I have lived to   see the day when I have been privil-  eged to listen to such gentlemen from  abroad present to us such sentiments  as given here tonight. And I  hope the day is not far distant when  Utah may receive all these principles   of liberty which are guaranteed by the  Constitution of the United States and  as they are enjoyed in Massachusetts.  (Applause.) 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  Next arose and said as the funeral ser-  vices on this occasion not only em-  braced the death of Brother David  Hoagland Cannon, whose tabernacle  now laid before the congregation, but   a great many other Elders who  had yielded up their lives while  preaching the Gospel to the nations of  the earth, an endeavor had been made  to publish these cases as far as they  had come to the knowledge of the  authorities, and Apostle Richards  would therefore read to those assembled   the list already furnished. After this  Brother Grant would read one of the  last letters written home from abroad  by the late David H. Cannon. 
 UTAH PRESS ASSOCIATION,   ROOM 305 ATLAS BLOCK.    ERNEST G. ROGNON, PRESIDENT  A. B. TOMSON, CORRESPONDING SECRETARY.    Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 1st, 1895.    Hon. Wilford Woodruff,  Pres. C. J. C. L. D. S., City.    Respected Sir:    The Utah Press Association, composed of the editors   of the Territorial newspapers, has invited the editors of the twenty-  two Western states between the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast  to Utah for a summer outing. The visitors will be here Aug. 27th  and 28th, on which dates a fraternal convention will be held in this  city, for the purpose of considering matters affecting our mutual  interests in the hope of creating a closer and more friendly ac-  quaintance with our brethren of the press in the great transmissis-  sippi states.    While the visiting editors are in Utah, we are desirous of   treating them in a becoming manner, and therefore will entertain  them at Saltair and extend to them such other evidences of our fra-  ternal sentiments and hospitality as workers in the same profession  are always pleased to receive from and exhibit to each other.    It is therefore the intention of the mangagment of this af-  fair to give a complimentary concert to the visitors in the grand  old Tabernacle, if the favor of its use can be obtained for that   purpose. In case the Tabernacle can be obtained, the famous choir  and a number of the leading musicians of the city will be asked to   take part on the program. As we intend the concert to be a com-  plimentary affair for the visiting editors, no charge will be made

 LAW OFFICES OF  F. F. DAVIS,  550 TEMPLE COURT.  MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.  Gardena Calif  Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  I have in my possession  a book that might be of value and interest  to you. This book is one of the original "Book  of Mormon" printed by E. B. Grandin Palmyra  N. Y. 1830. It has been handed down through  two generations of our family to me, being  first and formerly owned by my grandfather  Caleb P. Tibbets whose autograph is on the  fly leaf and who resided near Palmyra N. Y.  at the time the book was printed and  who knew and was personally acquainted  with Oliver Cowdery one of the three witnesses  The book at my grandfathers death came into  the possession of my Mother Amanda Tibbets  afterwards Amanda Davis and from her to  me. We have always Kept it Carefully as a  relic and I have had many offers of value for  it. I have now concluded to offer it for sale  and write to ask if you consider it of enough value 
 THE PRESS EXCURSION.    Utah Editors Preparing to Entertain  Their Visiting Brethren of the   Scissors and Quill.    It begins to look now as though the  Utah Press Association's invitation to  the editors of the Western States, to  hold a convention in this city, next   month, will be a bigger affair than was  at first expected, at least the favorable  responses A. B. Tomson, corresponding   secretary of the U. P. A., is daily re-  ceiving, give every indication such  will be the case. Editors are sending  enthusiastic letters to Mr. Tomson,  approving the idea of holding the con-  vention, and expressing their pleasure  on account of the opportunity afforded  for so grand a midsummer outing as  the editors are arranging. The below  extracts from correspondence received   by secretary Tomson, indicate how   well the idea takes outside of this Ter-  ritory.    Albert Tezler, secretary of the Ore-  gon Press association, writes: "Your   invitation to attend meeting in Salt  Lake accepted by unanimons vote at  our annual meeting held in Newport  July 20 24[t]h, and a delegation will  visit your fair city."    The president of the Wisconsin as-  sociation, John Neagle writes: "Can   say that our trip to Salt Lake is assured.  Your dates will suit us. I appreciate  your courtesy in this matter and write  you most heartily in acknowledg-  ment."    F. G. Simmons, chairman of the  executive committee of the Nebraska  Press association, writes: "Please give  me full particulars, including the prob-  able expense, length of time required  and any other information that you  can. We had another trip under con-  sideration, later in the season, but I   should be glad to hear all about your   excursion, and perhaps we would find   it better to go with you."    F. N. Merwin, editor of the Ne-  braska Editor, writes: "Whether or  not the association takes the excursion  I am desirous of doing so, and you can  count on my being there."    The editor of Ranch and Range, W.   S. Irwin, Nowata, I. T., writes:  "Yours at hand this morning and con-  tents noted. It is with pleasure that I  note your enthusiasm for the approach-  ing gathering and courtesy for 'Sun-  flower' and 'B. I. T.' editors. The   meeting should, and doubtless will,  accomplish much for Western journal-  ism, and in no wise more than socially  and fraternally. Let the good work  go on."    Case & Walker, of the Register, In-  dian Territory, write: "Replying to  yours of the 13th, will say that the  Register will certainly be represented  at the association if satisfactory ar-  rangements are made for transporta-  tion, for which we have already asked.  There are questions that a few of us  are interested in in this Territory that  could very properly and beneficially be   discussed by the Western association  you propose to form, and it would be   our purpose to bring these before the   said association."    F. G. Mock, editor Nampa Leader,  Idaho, writes: "I wish to say I am  heartily in favor of forming such a  federation as you speak of, and all  Idaho editors should join in such a  movement." 
 My Angels Michael Sashael and Gabriel  gave to My Servant at Salt Lake City  on the 4th day of October 1876 and  on the 22nd day of Decem 1877.

 THE GREAT PRESS ASSOCIATION  MEETING.    The Utah Press Association is mak-  ing arrangements to have a great meet-  ing here the last days of next month.  Invitations, we understand are being  sent out to all the immediate States  and Territories, the intention being to  have such a representative gathering as   will give marked importance to the  meeting. Various subjects are to be  discussed, particular the law of libel,  and other questions which directly con-  cern the newspaper fraternity. Elab-  orate preparations are also being made  to entertain these guests in a way to  keep up the old reputation of Salt Lake  City for hospitality. We think the citi-  zens ought to take an interest in this,   for every such meeting has a tendency   to give more dignity to the journalistic  profession, to enable it to be of more use  to the people. Good newspapers are  the greatest blessings that any commun-  ity ever had. Their influence extends   all through mens lives, and it is possible   for a good newspaper to make all the   community about it stronger and better.  Modern newspapers came with the steam  engine, the electric telegraph and the  great advancements which have been  made by the exploration of science. It  is an absolute necessity to the modern  man and woman, and this being true,  every effort to make it higher and nobler  ought to be supported and encouraged.   We hope the Press Association will have   a gathering such as that anticipated, and   that the results of it will be only for  good.—Salt Lake Tribune.    The Utah Press Association is making  arrangements for a conference of west-  ern newspaper men in this city the latter  part of August. It is expected the con-  ference will spread over several days  and will result in a western editors' fed-  eration being formed, the special   mission of which will be to secure the  enacting by the legislatures of the west-  ern states such laws in regard to libel  as may relieve the fraternity from some  of the injustices they now labor under.   The visitors while here will be hand-  somely entertained, and it is expected  their visit will prove a fine advertisement  for this territory.—Salt Lake Herald.

 OFFICE OF  Presidency Utah Stake of Zion.    Provo City, Utah, Dec. 25 1893.    Pres. W. Woodruff.    Dear Bro:    Enclosed please find  a letter which was handed me  last evening by Bp. Wride of the  2nd Ward, Provo. He says he made  the mistake in recommending  Joseph Beesley, instead of Philip  Beesley. He recommends Philip   Beesley, as a worthy person to be sent  appointed to go on a mission and  the same is indorsed by the  Presidency of the Stake.    Your Bro.  David John per L. 
 JUAB COUNTY,   UTAH TERRITORY    Salt Lake Litho Co.    JUAB COUNTY COURTHOUSE.    Nephi City, Dec. 5th. 1895,    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    It gives me pleasure to respond to the call,  which God has made of me through his servant here on earth, and though  I feel like a very weak instrument,am proud to know that I am consider  ed worthy of such an honor.    During a conversation with Pres. Jos. F. Smith, he told me it  would be perfectly sateisfactory for me to go to Great Britian instead  of the Northern States, therefore I will be ready to start on the 11th.  of January, instead of the 18th as that is the date on which Elders  J. W. Grace and Thos. Bailey will start, and if all is well I would like  to go with them as Bro. Grace is my Uncle and Bro. Bailey is an old  friend and we could make it more pleasant for each other than it would  be were it otherwise.    I Remain, Your Brother, in the Gospel of Christ,  G. W. McCune    Wm H. Warner  Bishop.  Nephi First Ward    All right. Notify him that his field will  be changed to England. J. F. S.
