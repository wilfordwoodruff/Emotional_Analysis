Immediately after thewriting of those letters I went to Lowell & Peterborough but as it happened ElderWm Smith had a meeting at each place at the time of my appointment tocollect money for the Temple + got some assistance for himself, I do not know how much he obtained in Lowell for either purpose, But onthe 1st Oct he took $150. dollars for the Temple and about $30 or $40 dollars forhimself of the church in peterborough N.H. which they donated for thatpurpose  he gave receipts for the mony donated for the Temple, he has visitedmost of the eastern churches I think, for the same purpose, how much moneyhe has collected for himself or Temple I do not know any thing about it, he toldme he was going to send the Temple money by Elder Wingate or Adamsas to the amount brought I suppose you or the Trustees will know about.All was right with the peterboro Church.  no trouble among them but unitedBut I found it different with the Lowell Church, Elder Wm Smith + myselfattended a Church meeting together there All the mail members resigned theiroffices in that branch of the Church except on Colourd Brother who was anElder But the president + Clerk resigned.  the reason was a complaint that has saluted my ears in most of the eastern Churches I have visited.  butI addvised them to hold their stations as they were, + go ahead all wouldbe right if, they did well they would be blessed, they were not accountable forothers faults, And they did so all kept their places, I visit two small branchsin New Hampshire one in in Gibson + the other near walpole I spent the nightwith Father Mark a Brother to Mother Smith two of his sons are Elders inthe Church I saw the old suller + Rouse place where Mother Smithwas born + whae Father Smith had a mill, I saw Elder Cordon +WestMinsterVt where he is opening a field the work seems to be doingwell in that region of country, I let Elder Clark take that $50.

 Copenhagen September 30, 1856.Elder WoodruffDear Brother!Your very wellcome letter I have recei-ved and I am thankfull for the news con-tained therein. I will in turn give you ashort account of my missionary life up tothis date. For the last six weeks I have beentravelling and preaching in several places.In England I have visited among others, Bir-mingham, Worcester, Cheltenham, Gloucester,Reading, London, where there is 35 organizedbranches—Bro Ross presiding. He brought together3 or 4 branches at a time, whereby I got the oppor-tunity to preach night after night untill wehad gone through all the Districts in this greatMetropolis. from there I went to Essex, and thento Leeds, Bradford, and Hull. I[n] all places Ihave ^had^ the privilege to bear testimony of the Latterday Work, and have had good times together withthe saints, which I have found to be a good people. As a general thing as I like Englandbetter than America in that respect that[sideways text]E. T. BensonCopanhagen Sept 30 1856Answered April 1st 1857 [end of sideways text]

 GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, May 1st, 1852To Millard Fillmore, President of the United States of North America:The undersigned, citizens of the Territory of Utah, do most respectfully submit the following petition to the Honorable Chief Magistrate of the United States.Believing that the unanimous voice and request of the permanent male citizens of this Territory, without distinction of political or religious parties, will receive due consideration in the mind of the National Executive before heshall confer appointments for Territorial officers for Utah, We beg leave to submit the following names,viz: Hon: Willard Richards for Secretary; Heber C. Kimball for Chief Justice; and Orson Hyde for Associate Jus-tice. These names, be assured honored Sir, have long been known by the entire mass of this people, and representmen whose integrity, patriotism, and loyalty to the United States have hitherto been untarnished by the breath ofsuspicion among the citizens of Utah.Their legal qualifications are ample to subserve the ends of justice, and the provisions of the Constitution of the United States; and their appointment will promote confidence and give entire satisfaction to this whole people, asthe following signatures indicate: and, also, perpetuate the most amicable relations with all the members of theNational Confederacy by their affable and liberal bearing to all men without culpable affection or favor.It is conceived that their being permanent residents among us, will obviate the recurrence of such difficulties asmight arise from sudden removals or resignation, which have recently occasioned so much excitement and evilsurmisings in our nation. Should these men meet with your approbation and that of the Senate, and be appointedto the offices designated for our infant Territory, be assured, a great hearted, patriotic, loyal, and industrious peo-ple, as they ever have done, will continue to pray.

 CIRCULAR.Salt Lake City, August 17, 1872.TO THE FEMALE RELIEF SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT UTAH TERRITORY:LADIES: The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, ata meeting of its Board of Directors on the 10th day of August inst., recognizing the fact that heretofore the ladies have contributed in a  liberal manner to their department, until it has become one of the leading features of our exhibitions, ordered that a circular be written calling upon all the Relief Societies to unite, and by a concentration of effort, accomplish that which will be highly creditable and be parallel with Utah's advanced growth.Exhibitions of Domestic Products and Manufactures are con- sidered of such utility and importance that they form a prominent part of the civil policy of the nations; and the people who foster and excelin their products and industries lay the foundation of commercial independence.A people situated as we are, so remote from other manufacturing districts, aided by the heavy tariffs of transportation, have every stimulus to encourage them in this direction. The adoption of this policy is pregnant with benefits on every hand. While attaining the desirable status of having "the beauty of our apparel the workmanship of our own hands," the laudable condition is also reached of furnishing employment for the heavy tide of immigrants coming westward and for the legion of youth growing up in our midst.A word to the wise is sufficient: Ladies, you are respectfully invited to contribute and to take an active part in rendering this exhibition a step in advance of its predecessors.W.

Wilford Woodruff,Dear Bro.:Your letter wasreceived on the 18th, and was quite asurprise to one, as I did not know I wasa member of any ward, having spent mostof my time, since I was a boy, on ranches.You wish to know how I feel. I amnow forty years old, and have very littleeducation, having never had any schooling.My knowledge of the gospel, I fear, isless than of other things; having never hadany desire for a mission. I have not postedmyself, and living so much of my time onthe ranch, have never officiated in anycapacity, or addressed an audience ofany kind. I firmly believe in the prin-ciples of the gospel, as far as I do understand them, and wish to have my sonas he grows up, well educated and pre-pared for the missionary field. 
 If it would be best in youropinion to postpone the matterfor a little season I shall workto that end and be ready to goat any date you may set in thefuture; or if you think I shouldgo right away I will endeavorto get ready.
