If he was a wise shepherd would he have  lost all his flock in Pittsburg, judge ye    president Young   Scarborough Maine Nov 16' 1844  I feel disposed to give you an account of things with me since I last wrote  for I suppose long before this time you have recieved the letters I sent you by  Elder Wingate, I then gave you an account of my visit among the churchs  and my feelings about matters affairs + things.  Immediately after the  writing of those letters I went to Lowell & Peterborough but as it happened Elder  Wm Smith had a meeting at each place at the time of my appointment to  collect money for the Temple + got some assistance for himself, I do   not know how much he obtained in Lowell for either purpose, But on  the 1st Oct he took $150. dollars for the Temple and about $30 or $40 dollars for  himself of the church in peterborough N.H. which they donated for that  purpose  he gave receipts for the mony donated for the Temple, he has visited  most of the eastern churches I think, for the same purpose, how much money  he has collected for himself or Temple I do not know any thing about it, he told  me he was going to send the Temple money by Elder Wingate or Adams  as to the amount brought I suppose you or the Trustees will know about.  All was right with the peterboro Church.  no trouble among them but united  But I found it different with the Lowell Church, Elder Wm Smith + myself  attended a Church meeting together there All the mail members resigned their  offices in that branch of the Church except on Colourd Brother who was an  Elder But the president + Clerk resigned.  the reason was a complaint that   has saluted my ears in most of the eastern Churches I have visited.  but  I addvised them to hold their stations as they were, + go ahead all would  be right if, they did well they would be blessed, they were not accountable for  others faults, And they did so all kept their places, I visit two small branchs  in New Hampshire one in in Gibson + the other near walpole I spent the night  with Father Mark a Brother to Mother Smith two of his sons are Elders in  the Church I saw the old suller + Rouse place where Mother Smith  was born + whae Father Smith had a mill, I saw Elder Cordon +  WestMinsterVt where he is opening a field the work seems to be doing  well in that region of country, I let Elder Clark take that $50.

I have to   say that I will do all in my   power to reach Salt Lake City on   time to make other points as   indicated in your letter.  I would  be pleasded however if its not putting  you to to much inconvenience if   you would inform me of the latest   date upon which I can start from  that point, as I shall need every moment  of time possible to arrange my   affairs here for my departure    Your Bro in the Gospel  David Elisha Lindsay.

 Copenhagen September 30, 1856.    Elder Woodruff    Dear Brother!    Your very wellcome letter I have recei-  ved and I am thankfull for the news con-  tained therein. I will in turn give you a  short account of my missionary life up to  this date. For the last six weeks I have been  travelling and preaching in several places.  In England I have visited among others, Bir-  mingham, Worcester, Cheltenham, Gloucester,  Reading, London, where there is 35 organized  branchesâ€”Bro Ross presiding. He brought together  3 or 4 branches at a time, whereby I got the oppor-  tunity to preach night after night untill we  had gone through all the Districts in this great  Metropolis. from there I went to Essex, and then  to Leeds, Bradford, and Hull. I[n] all places I  have ^had^ the privilege to bear testimony of the Latter  day Work, and have had good times together with  the saints, which I have found to be a good peo  ple. As a general thing as I like England  better than America in that respect that    [sideways text]  E. T. Benson  Copanhagen Sept 30 1856  Answered April 1st 1857   [end of sideways text]

The organization hereto-  fore, on account of bad management and many missteps,  the people have entirely lost confidence in them;  they therefore have declaired themselves, (with  the exception four besides the Bishops own family,)  from under their rule and administration, which  has heretofore kept them in poverty and dis-  grace, and wished to be freed from them, and  have other men appointed to rule over the  affairs of this place, who are competent, and  who have the confidence of the people. And  we are further authorized and instructed to mention  names to you who would be qualified to act in any  office, and who would have the entire confidence  of the people, to wit: Joseph F. Fippin, Harrison  Severe, Jas. McBride, John Thirkell, Aroet L.  Hale and Alma H. Hale.    Yours, truly,   John W. Cooley,  Willford Hudson,  A. C. Brower.

Many and various are the sceens ^scenes^ through which   we have boath passed since (to me) those very  memorable periods, in which I held sweet   communion for short intervals with you.

Having finished our visit in  this place, blessed the saints, instructed them and taken  leave of them, retourned we from Stockholm via Baltic  with Steamer to Ystad (Eastad), had a pleasant ride of  36 engl miles through a good farming country to  MalmÃ¶, where we also have a branch of the Curch,  and there we took Steamer for Copenhagen, where  we arrived safely the 29th instant after having made  a journey of 11 to 1200 miles. I do intend to visit more  of the Conferences before leaving Denmark, and it  is a pleasure to me to see the kind feelings of  the saints towards me, how they try to show it  in all possible manner. The law of tithing is  about to be introduced throughout all the Scandi-  navian Mission, and the saints rejoices highly in  it, and understand it and consider it as a great  privilege to live under this law. Shortlyâ€”I have  the best feelings for this Mission. It numbers at  present nearly 3000 members. I intend to be in Liverpool  about the 20th of October. Bro O. Pratt is labouring with  his valuable talents to give the Gospel to the citizens of  Liverpool, preaching every Sunday to large Congregations.    Please to remember me to Pres Young and Kimball  and Grant and my Brethren in the prayer circle, and  the Brethren in your Office, together with all inquiring  friends, and I say God bless you and them for ever. x    [sideways text]   x A Line from You any time would be very acceptable; it is as water for  thirsty soul to hear from my Brethren in the Mountains.

 GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, May 1st, 1852    To Millard Fillmore, President of the United States of North America:    The undersigned, citizens of the Territory of Utah, do most respectfully submit the following petition to the   Honorable Chief Magistrate of the United States.    Believing that the unanimous voice and request of the permanent male citizens of this Territory, without distinc  tion of political or religious parties, will receive due consideration in the mind of the National Executive before he  shall confer appointments for Territorial officers for Utah, We beg leave to submit the following names,  viz: Hon: Willard Richards for Secretary; Heber C. Kimball for Chief Justice; and Orson Hyde for Associate Jus-  tice. These names, be assured honored Sir, have long been known by the entire mass of this people, and represent  men whose integrity, patriotism, and loyalty to the United States have hitherto been untarnished by the breath of  suspicion among the citizens of Utah.    Their legal qualifications are ample to subserve the ends of justice, and the provisions of the Constitution of the   United States; and their appointment will promote confidence and give entire satisfaction to this whole people, as  the following signatures indicate: and, also, perpetuate the most amicable relations with all the members of the  National Confederacy by their affable and liberal bearing to all men without culpable affection or favor.    It is conceived that their being permanent residents among us, will obviate the recurrence of such difficulties as  might arise from sudden removals or resignation, which have recently occasioned so much excitement and evil  surmisings in our nation. Should these men meet with your approbation and that of the Senate, and be appointed  to the offices designated for our infant Territory, be assured, a great hearted, patriotic, loyal, and industrious peo-  ple, as they ever have done, will continue to pray.

 CIRCULAR.    Salt Lake City, August 17, 1872.    TO THE FEMALE RELIEF SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT   UTAH TERRITORY:    LADIES: The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, at  a meeting of its Board of Directors on the 10th day of August inst.,   recognizing the fact that heretofore the ladies have contributed in a    liberal manner to their department, until it has become one of the   leading features of our exhibitions, ordered that a circular be written   calling upon all the Relief Societies to unite, and by a concentration of   effort, accomplish that which will be highly creditable and be parallel   with Utah's advanced growth.    Exhibitions of Domestic Products and Manufactures are con-   sidered of such utility and importance that they form a prominent part   of the civil policy of the nations; and the people who foster and excel  in their products and industries lay the foundation of commercial   independence.    A people situated as we are, so remote from other manufacturing   districts, aided by the heavy tariffs of transportation, have every   stimulus to encourage them in this direction. The adoption of this   policy is pregnant with benefits on every hand. While attaining the   desirable status of having "the beauty of our apparel the workmanship   of our own hands," the laudable condition is also reached of furnishing   employment for the heavy tide of immigrants coming westward and   for the legion of youth growing up in our midst.    A word to the wise is sufficient: Ladies, you are respectfully   invited to contribute and to take an active part in rendering this   exhibition a step in advance of its predecessors.    W.

 notice, I have just brought  my cattle home fom the Uintah  reservation where they have been  ranging and and going to  feed them at home. I have  the material nearly all on the  ground to build a ninety foot  shed to shelter them this winter  and really, brother Woodruff, I  will have to put it up myself  for I have not the means to hire  it down. This fall I can just  about pay all my obligations  excepting the farm; that and  the lease money will bind  me for two years and probably  for three. Now, my dear  brother, these are as read my  circumstances as I can de-  scribe them and I am will-  ing to leave it to you to  say what I shall do.

 Beaver City,  20th March, 1895.    Pres't. Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Bro.:  Your letter was  received on the 18th, and was quite a  surprise to one, as I did not know I was  a member of any ward, having spent most  of my time, since I was a boy, on ranches.    You wish to know how I feel. I am  now forty years old, and have very little  education, having never had any schooling.    My knowledge of the gospel, I fear, is  less than of other things; having never had  any desire for a mission. I have not posted  myself, and living so much of my time on  the ranch, have never officiated in any  capacity, or addressed an audience of  any kind. I firmly believe in the prin-  ciples of the gospel, as far as I do under  stand them, and wish to have my son  as he grows up, well educated and pre-  pared for the missionary field. 
 If it would be best in your  opinion to postpone the matter  for a little season I shall work  to that end and be ready to go  at any date you may set in the  future; or if you think I should  go right away I will endeavor  to get ready. Please answer  immediately as I am anxiously  awaiting the return.    Your Bro. in the Gospel    E D Clyde  Heber Wasatch Co  Utah.

Cooks thought I might get ground in the  night & come back in the morning so as to spend a part of  the day with you but on our way there we drove into that  mud hole south of Swan Creek which took us an hour  to get out having to unload when we arived at the Mill  it was dark & he could not grind it untill Morning so it  was Near 10 oclok when we started back and after travelling  about a mile our tyre tire run off from one wheel and  broke the fellies [felloes] we had to carry the wheat back by hand  & it took till 3 oclok before we started again and so on our

Both are great works, but  I know the latter is greater, and therefore   do I willingly amend my plans, knowing  that if it be God's will, that can come   after my mission has been honorably   fulfilled, and I will be a better man,   a better instrument in God's hands  for accomplishing good than I   otherwise would be.  I do not flinch,  but feel to accept the call gladly,   and that it is an honor to be num-  bered among God's people.  Nothing unforseen  happening I will be ready at the appointed  time.
