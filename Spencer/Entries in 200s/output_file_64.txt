ENDENTRY Springville Utah Feb 8th 1898  To the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Dear Brethren  The editorial article concerning the Word of Wisdom in the Juvenile Instructor of Jan 1st has made a deep impression on our minds. Through the inspirations of the Spirit and after fasting and unitedly seeking the Lord we have been led to address to you this testimonial.  Testifying, that as members of the Church of Jesus Christ, as heads of families, and as members of the Physiological Reform Association, we do keep the Word of Wisdom. That this Association is the outgrowth of Sister Hannah Sorensen's teachings; that, though we believed and sought to practice the word of wisdom previous to our knowledge of her and her work, yet through her teachings we were shown a simple and practical way of living it. Her teachings are all in harmony with the Word of Wisdom; in fact, if  we may use the illustration, the word of wisdom as revealed through the Prophet Joseph and taught by our beloved leaders today, is but the skeleton of the perfect form which her teachings clothe and make so gloriously beautiful. Through the labors of the dear humble sister our lives have been  made better and purer and since practicing her teachings we have had more joy in serving the Lord.
