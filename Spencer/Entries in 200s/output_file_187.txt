The beauties of this place exceed discription. Grand old trees of the live oak variety, which nature  had planted, were on every hand, making the scenery  very park-like. The profusion with which flowers grow is indiscribably beautiful. The grass was like velvet under  the feet. The grounds are most extensive immediately  around the hotel, and the building itself is exceedingly  large and occupies a lovely position. We are told there  is a very beautiful maze in the grounds, which, however we  did not visit. It was arranged last night that we  should get up and have breakfast and be ready to start by  eight o'clock. Mr Badlam had arranged for a vehicle  to carry us all. There were four seats, and they were  sufficiently wide for three of us to fit comfortably together. To this four spirited horses were attached. There were  thirteen of us, including the driver. The object in starting at eight oclock was to make the drive of seventeen miles upon the company's grounds. Probably no finer drive  could be found anywhere. The Southern Pacific Railroad  company found this extensive tract of land in the possession  of one person and with wise forethought and discrimina- tion, they had purchased the entire tract. It borders on the  Ocean and besides furnishing extensive stretches of  beautiful forest, there are long reaches near the margin of the ocean furnishing beautiful views of the Bay of  Monterey and the ocean outside.

We saw a Chinese  Junk, and there were a number of Italian fishermen  in their vessels, which carry lateen sails, such as are  used in the Mediterranian. These Italians do a great  deal of fishing here. The Chinese also gather abalone  shells. The meat of this shell fish they dry in large quan- tities. It is said to be very palatable when dried. They  use large quantities of it in this country, and, we are told, ship large quantities, as well as shrimps, to China.  The principal timbers of this valuable tract of land is of  a variety of pine and cypress and is very rare. In fact botanists say that there is no cypress other than this to be found on this continent, and to see this  variety one must visit the Holy Land. The pine,  also, is peculiar to this region. Botanists praise  the Judicious course taken by the Southern Pacific  company in purchasing this tract and preserving these  varieties of trees. of course, pains are now taken to pro- pagate them extensively, and in many places along the coast, and especially in San Francisco, they are  largely cultivated for ornament.
