The profusion with which flowers grow is indiscribably beautiful. The grass was like velvet under  the feet. The grounds are most extensive immediately  around the hotel, and the building itself is exceedingly  large and occupies a lovely position.

The Southern Pacific Railroad  company found this extensive tract of land in the possession  of one person and with wise forethought and discrimina- tion, they had purchased the entire tract.

We saw a Chinese   in their vessels, which carry lateen sails, such as are  used in the Mediterranian. These Italians do a great  deal of fishing here. The Chinese also gather abalone  shells. The meat of this shell fish they dry in large quan- tities. It is said to be very palatable when dried. They  use large quantities of it in this country, and, we are told, ship large quantities, as well as shrimps, to China.  The principal timbers of this valuable tract of land is of  a variety of pine and cypress and is very rare. In fact botanists say that there is no cypress other than this to be found on this continent, and to see this  variety one must visit the Holy Land. The pine,  also, is peculiar to this region. Botanists praise  the Judicious course taken by the Southern Pacific  company in purchasing this tract and preserving these  varieties of trees. of course, pains are now taken to pro- pagate them extensively, and in many places along the coast, and especially in San Francisco, they are  largely cultivated for ornament.
