But if you  see fit to change me I am  perfectly willing as I think it   would be just as heathy for me  or perhaps more so those Callifornia  being raised toin this high altitude  But I am at your service and   wherever you see fit for me

 Elder Wilford Woodruff:â€” "Last  Spring, long after the time of plowing  and sowing, Pres. Young told us not  to fret ourselves, for we should have a   fruitful season. The gardens have been  watered from the clouds in such a way  that I have not before seen in these  mountains. We enjoy many blessings   in these visits. The people are blessed   in leaving their fields and work-shops  to attend these meetings, to rejoice to-  gether in the things of the kingdom of  God. There is no better field to preach  in than in Utah; we need preaching to.  We are subject to temptation, and are  in the midst of evils that are seeking to  overthrow those principles that will ex-  alt man."    He then referred to the reading of  novels and other kinds of fiction, and  their injurious tendency, noticing the   fiction so generally believed in by the   christian world, that the Lord is an un-  organized being, without body, parts or  passions.    "Though the Twelve Apostles are or-  dained to the power of the Apostleship,  they exercise their calling under the di-  rection of the First Presidency. No  man but the President has a right to  give a revelation for the guidance of  this Church; it is the right of every   Latter-day Saint to have revelations  for their individual benefit: but none of  us have a right to give a new doctrine   to the Church without the consent and  knowledge of the First Presidency of  the Church.    This life is dear to us, for in it we are  expected to prepare for a higher sphere.  All the powers of earth are against this  kingdom. We must live near to God,  and be rich in the preparations of the  gospel. Let us be efficient in these   matters."    He then spoke on the necessity of   cleansing out of our fields the noxious   weeds; not only to clean them out of  our growing crops, but to mow the bor-  ders of fields, and not suffer them to go  to seed, and change the land to hoed  crops until the foul weeds are all des-  troyed.

Would say in answer to same,  that I feel honared in being called  and fulley expect to be ready by  the date Named May 19 [18]98  and sincerly hope with the help  of the Lord to fulfell a Mission  that will be acceptable to our  Heavenly Father, The Church and  myself    Your Brother in the Gospel  H. J. Foulger. Jr. 
 He was followed by ELDER  WOODRUFF who saidâ€”    I am satisfied there is great re-  joicing this day in the spirit world.  We have a large assembly of per-  sons here witnessing the ceremo-  nies, who tabernacle in the flesh.  If our eyes were opened so that we  could see those around us who too  are witnessing quite as intently and  anxiously these proceedings as we  are, and very probably more so,  where we now behold one, there  would be hundreds of thousands.  The Prophet Joseph is not dead,   neither are his fellow servants now   with him; they are alive and work  ing energetically in the same great  cause; and they and the hosts of  the spirits of men rejoice when the  foundation and every stone of a  temple is laid; for they will know  in their prison homes that their   salvation depends upon these   things. Joseph Smith, although  separated from us, is one with us;  Brigham Young is still with us,   and I say and declare to you and to  all men, that not only they, but  every apostle and all good men that  ever lived upon the earth, are with  us; their eyes are watching our pro-  ceedings; and in fact God himself  with all the hosts of heaven are also   engaged in this work; and yet the  whole of it pertaining to the flesh  devolves upon the Latter-day  Saints in these valleys of the moun-  tains.    Brethren and sisters, arise up  and hasten the building of this   Temple, and never stop until it is  finished. And then we will con-  tinue on and build others else-  where, and not rest from our labors  while we tarry in the flesh; but   ever labor for and guard and de-  fend the interests of our our  Father's kingdom, performing ev-  ery duty, remaining true and faith-  ful to death, that we may inherit  eternal lives. And that we may  do so, is my prayer in the name of   Jesus. Amen.

 COUNTY of EMERY.    MOLEN, Utah, Apr: 11 1898    Prs: Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother    I am sorry that I have to inform  you that the young man Martinus Larson  there is caled to go on a mission to the Northeren  States is not able to go, when he reseived his  call I. told him to think that matter over  and see what he could do. a while after  came to me and told me that he would  go on that mission, and handed me a letter  to that efect. I asked him if he had  the money so he could go, he told me yes  he thought that would be alright, and as  his Father and Brothers are considred pretty well  of and that he had some him self. I signed  the letter with him, we got for him from the  Ward some over $50 which I thought was pretty  well as this is a very small Ward, and the majory  of the People are poor, but of course it would  not be enogh, it have always been my desire  to run in excuses for my Brethren, and I would  do it in this case if I could.

June 30th 1898    President Woodruff    Dear Brother    As my Son John E Magleby, has   been called on a Mission to New  Zealand and inasmuch as he has  already filled one Mission to that  place, I would desire, if it would  be in accordance with your mind  that the place of mission be changed   to Norway it being his mothers  Birth place who died thirty years  ago, and I desire to gather her geneo-  logy. He also has cousins in the  States that he would like to pay a   visit to on his way.

 but instead of appreciating the kindnes  of the People and my earnest work in his  favor Redicule and Insinuation have been  the reward, this however is more his relation  than him in talking to him about it  he said he would like to go on that  mission as soon as he could get the necessary  means, but I could realise that the influense  of the Famely have had some bearing on  him, of course they are trying to place the  blame on me, but I am not the first  man there has been blamed without a  cause, but thousands of my Brethern in this  Church have past through such things,   only a great deal more so. I have generally  tried to bear my own feelings without making  them known to my Brethern over me, knowing  that they have enough of their own, but I felt  it my duty to let you know that he was not going,  and I have been moved upon to give this explaination,  so I trust you will bear with me. -- I remain your   Brother in the Gospel.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'    MILLENNIAL STAR.    "FEAR NOT, LITTLE FLOCK; FOR IT IS YOUR FATHER'S GOOD PLEASURE TO  GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM."â€” Luke xii, 32.    No. 23, Vol. LI. Monday, June 10, 1889. Price One Penny.    DISCOURSE  DELIVERED BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF AT THE GENERAL CONFER-  ENCE, SALT LAKE CITY, ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 7, 1887.    (Reported by Arthur Winter.)    -[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 339.]-    Read the history of ancient nations  and the dealings of God with them,  as contained in the Bible and other  historical works. When those ancient  kingdoms and peoples became wicked   and corrupt, when they turned away  from all that was virtuous and holy,  the Lord raised up prophets to warn   them; and these prophets, though  perhaps unpopular in the eyes of   those with whom they dwelt, warned  these nations and cities of the judg-  ments that would overtake them.  What followed the warnings of these  prophets? Read of the fall of the   mighty cities of Thebes, Nineveh,  Memphis, Tyre and Sidon, Babylon  the Great, and Jerusalem itself. All  these great and mighty cities and na-  tions were warned by the servants of  God of the judgments that would   overtake them. Did the inhabitants   of those cities believe the words of   the prophets? They did not. But did  those words come to pass? They did;  and those cities were laid waste and  their inhabitants destoyed. Thus   the words of the prophets and inspired  men were fulfilled to the very letter,  not one jot or tittle failing unfulfilled.  And yet the infidel says there is no  God. These same prophets and pa-  triarchs also saw, by vision and reve-  lation, our day; they pointed out the   generation in which we live, and they  all declared that, in the latter days,  the God of heaven would set His   hand to gather together His people  and establish His kingdom. The  Revelator St. John also declared what  should come to pass in the latter days.  In the 14th chapter of Revelations he  says:    "And I looked, and lo, a Lamb  stood on the Mount Zion, and with  Him an hundred forty and four  thousand, having His Father's name  written in their foreheads."    These one hundred and forty-four  thousand were sealed out of all the 
 354  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    twelve tribes of Israel, because they   were righteous in the latter days.  Following this, John says:    "And I saw another angel fly in the  midst of heaven, having the everlast-  ing Gospel to preach unto them that   dwell on the earth, and to every na-  tion, and kindred, and tongue, and  people,    "Saying with a loud voice, Fear  God, and give glory to Him; for the  hour of His judgment is come."    Again, John says:    "Again there followed another an-  gel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen,  that great city, because she made all  nations drink of the wine of the wrath  of her fornication."    Following this, he speaks of the   reaping down of the earth and of the   judgments of God which were to   come upon the inhabitants thereof.    In fulfillment of the declaration of   St. John, the angel of God has flown   through the midst of heaven. He has  delivered the Gospel of Jesus Christ  to the inhabitants of the earth, and  revealed unto them the word of the   Lord. The Holy Priesthood had also  been restord. This Gospel was to be  preached "to every nation, and kind-  red, and tongue, and people." It has  now been preached almost sixty yearsâ€”  from the organization of the Church  until to-day; and in fulfillment of the   revelations of these inspired Prophets   and Apostles, a multitude of people   are to-day gathered together in these  valleys of the mountains. In fulfill-  ment of those revelations I stand to-  day in this Tabernacle, which the   Prophet saw was to be built upon the  tops of the mountains, as a covering  from the heat and the storm. In this   Tabernacle to-day, also, are ten thou-  sand Latter-day Saints, which is a   witness to Jew and Gentile of the ful-  fillment of the promises of God. Yet  the infidel says, "Behold, there is no  God." The man who says there is no   God is a fool. We are here in fulfill-  ment of prophecy and revelation. We  have received the Gospel of Christ.  The kingdom of God has been organ-  ized. It is rolling on; and it will  continue to roll on until this scene is   wound up.    Now, I want to give a little exhor-  tation to my brethren. Brother Geo.  Q. Cannon touched upon a very im-  portant principle this forenoonâ€”a  principle which has often rested upon  my mind; that is, with regard to the  spirits that surround us. He said  that one-third of the hosts of heaven   were cast out because of their re-  bellion. I suppose we may say that  at least one hundred thousand mill-  ions were cast down from heaven to   earth. Where are they? Some are  in Salt Lake, some in New York, some   in Amsterdam, some in Constanti-  nople, some in Jerusalem; in fact,  they are in every city and hamlet  wherein the inhabitants of the earth  dwell, and especially where there are   any Latter-day Saints. And whether  there are one hundred or not to every  man, woman, and child, there are  enough of them, at least, to labor for  our overthrow. I say to my Coun-  selors, to the Apostles, to the Seven-  ties, the High Priests, the Bishops,  and all men who bear the Holy Priest-  hood, do you suppose these devils are   around us without trying to do some-  thing? Are they asleep? Have they  not a work to perform? I say to my  brethren who bear the Priesthood, we  have got a mighty warfare to wage   with these spirits. We cannot escape  it. What will they do to you? They  will try to make us do anything and   everything that is not right. These   devils would be very glad to make me  and my brethren think we are great  men, smarter than anyone else; to  divide us one against the other, and   to cause us to seek to confess our  brother's sins instead of our own. We  should, therefore, watch ourselves  well. I should do this; my Coun-  selors and the Apostles should; we  all should. And unless we are united  together, as has been said before, we  are not the Lord's. But to-day we  have certainly manifested a union  here that the world is not acquainted   with. We have, however, a mighty  responsibility resting upon us. The  eyes of all the heavenly hosts are   upon us. The eyes of Father Adam,  and the patriarchs and the prophets,  both ancient and modern, who have  gone to the other side of the veil, are  over us. And if our eyes are open to  comprehend the things of God, we  can comprehend our responsibilities; 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 355    we can comprehend the powers of the   Holy Priesthood and the relationship  which we sustain to God. We cer-  tainly should humble ouselves before  the Lord. We should labor with all  our might to build up the kingdom   of God in what little time we have   to spend here in the flesh. Our aim  is high. We aim at eternal life; we  aim at immortal glory; we aim at a  place in the celestial kingdom of our   God, with God and Christ and those  who have kept the celestial law. In  order to get there, we have got to  keep the same law that has exalted  those who have gone before us. This  is not our home. We were kept in  the spirit world until this generation,  and have been brought forth, through  the loins of Joseph and Ephraim, to  stand in the flesh and to bear off the  kingdom, to hold the Holy Priest-  hood, to do the works of righteous-  ness, to build temples, to redeem our  dead, and to attend to those ordi-  nances which the God of heaven has   declared we shall perform. This is  our work. We have a long eternity  before us. But all of us will have to  meet at the bar of Godâ€”the righteous  and the wicked, those we are living  and those who are dead.    This is the condition of the Latter-  day Saints. I hope that we may  escape the power of the enemy. As  was said here this forenoon, it matters  but very little what may take place  outside of Zion, or outside of the   kingdom of God. The God of Israel  holds the destiny of this nation; He  holds the destiny of this people, and  of all men on the face of the earth.  They are at His command and in His  power. He will hold this nation, as  He did Jerusalem, responsible for the   course they pursue with regard to the  Latter-day Saints. We also will be  held responsible for the course we  pursue. The Lord has led this Church   from its organization until the present  day. He will lead it until the coming  of the Son of Man. He is not going  to desert His people nor His cause.  But it is our duty to plead with the  Lord, remember our prayers, keep our  covenants, and walk perpetually be-  fore Him, that we may have His   favor and blessing resting upon us.    I wish to say, with regard to the   rising generationâ€”the sons and  daughters of the Latter-day Saintsâ€”  that they should take the counsel of  their fathers; they should honor their  parents, and honor God, and re-  ceive such counsel as is given unto  them by wise men. I think many  times that our children do not com-  prehend the position they occupy.  They do not comprehend what lies  before them. Their fathers are pass-  ing away. Yet this kingdom has got  to remain on the earth until the  coming of the Son of Man. This work   has got to follow their fathers; it has  got to rest upon the sons and daughters  of Zion. I have a great desire that  the institutions which have been or-  ganized in Zion for their welfare may  be blessed; that our sons and daugh-  ters may attend the Primaries, the  Sabbath schools and Mutual Improve-  ment Associations, and unite together  in these societies, that they may re-  ceive the benefit of the same.    Brethren and sisters, God bless  you. Let us labor with one heart and   one mind, and make our wants known  unto the Lord. Let our prayers  ascend unto the ears of the Lord of  Sabbaoth, and they will be heard and  answered. I know that if we are   blessed, if we are preserved, and if  we are saved, it is and will be through  the mercy and blessing of God. I   know also that inasmuch as we will  obey His commandments we will re-  ceive His protection and blessing.  Zion will arise. Zion will be clothed  with the glory of God. Zion will be  redeemed. Zion will be prepared for   the coming of the Son of Man. The  Jews will be gathered home to Jeru-  salem. And the promises and pro-  phecies concerning bo[t]h the Jews and  the Saints of God will all have their  fulfillment in the earth. My prayer  to God is that we may be true and   faithful to the end of our days, and  that we may magnify our calling as  Apostles, Elders, and Saints while we  dwell in the flesh. Amen.    God sometimes gives us friendship as the scaffolding of our lives, and when our  character is built up He removes them.

 San Antonio  (Austin,) Texas, March 2 [18]98    To The Elders of The Mormon Church of  Latter Day Saints  Salt lake City, Utah.    Dear Friends and Brothers in Humanity:    The Spirit has moved me  to address you, although from this far  away place and in these troublesome  times I believe the faithful of your  church and more especially the native  born Americans who have their countrys good  at heart as well as all christians of  whatever denomination who believe in  the laws of Moses and the teachings of  Christ, can be more readily organized  under the "White Cross" to resist a  secret invasion or controle of these United  States in humanity by human agents  of a Foreign power or powers who have  intermingled into all forms of society and  demon like they are destroyers. Although  remember there are many foreign born  natives and others who are not. Those  who are are deceivers whose tongues are like  unto a two edged sword.    For these are the signs as it appears  to me. For when brother rise up against  brother, father against his children,  friend against friend, for when people  are and are not. When the Jew is

Dear Brother: Your letter of   inquiry regarding my call to the Eastern  States as a missionary was received  on the 9th. I delayed answering to  converse with my Bishop, but being   thirty miles from him I failed even by  telephone.    At present my wife is in a very   delicate condition and being away from  our people and among strangers I deem  it unwise to leave her and unsafe  for her to travel. Therefore if it meets  your approval I would like to wait  until fall, as by that time I can   have my family located in Utah  with our people and will cheerfully   respond to the call.

Hence believe me in these instructions.    Yours in Humanity:  Harry T. Fretelliere    127 N. Flores St. San Antonio  Texas

 P/S.    There are so many false rumors  and evan publications as  well as cablegrams, that are  attributed as passing in Foreign   countries, and the same is used  when they are actually occurring  in these United States.    China, Kiow Chow bay, Cubaâ€”  Turkey,â€”, as well in many  personal and local affairs.    Home our army (regular) as  well as navy is vastly in numbers  ^composed^ of that Foreign element, and even  to-day the militia is fast being or  passing under such controllâ€”    The President Wm McKinley should  be advised fully of all these things.

But I understand that  National conditions are not favorable   for traveling at presant.    So in reply to the call I will   say I accept it with pleasure and   and will make preperations to start   on the date given (July 21 1898)    I feel my inability to act  in such a responsible calling,  but with the help of the Lord I   will try to do what ever I may  be called upon.

My attention has been called to the  fact of being called, But I thought it  would not be for four or five years yet.    As I have been chossen, it is my intention  to go and do the best I can.    I feel well in the Gospel, having a  testimony burning within my bassom of  the work and its divinity. I think it   will be a blessing unto me and a help to   my people. I relize that I am a week mortol  and that the success of my mission will  depentd upon my humillty before God.    I am prepared to goon the appointed  day, as I stated in my answere to the  call, if I have health. When I think of  going it fills my heart with sorrow  to think of leaving my friends and   relatives, and still it fills my whole   being with joy at the same time.
