 Elder Wilford Woodruff:â€” "LastSpring, long after the time of plowingand sowing, Pres. Young told us notto fret ourselves, for we should have a fruitful season. The gardens have beenwatered from the clouds in such a waythat I have not before seen in thesemountains. We enjoy many blessings in these visits. The people are blessed in leaving their fields and work-shopsto attend these meetings, to rejoice to-gether in the things of the kingdom ofGod. There is no better field to preachin than in Utah; we need preaching to.We are subject to temptation, and arein the midst of evils that are seeking tooverthrow those principles that will ex-alt man."He then referred to the reading ofnovels and other kinds of fiction, andtheir injurious tendency, noticing the fiction so generally believed in by the christian world, that the Lord is an un-organized being, without body, parts orpassions."Though the Twelve Apostles are or-dained to the power of the Apostleship,they exercise their calling under the di-rection of the First Presidency. Noman but the President has a right togive a revelation for the guidance ofthis Church; it is the right of every Latter-day Saint to have revelationsfor their individual benefit: but none ofus have a right to give a new doctrine to the Church without the consent andknowledge of the First Presidency ofthe Church.This life is dear to us, for in it we areexpected to prepare for a higher sphere.All the powers of earth are against thiskingdom. We must live near to God,and be rich in the preparations of thegospel. Let us be efficient in these matters."He then spoke on the necessity of cleansing out of our fields the noxious weeds; not only to clean them out ofour growing crops, but to mow the bor-ders of fields, and not suffer them to goto seed, and change the land to hoedcrops until the foul weeds are all des-troyed.

 He was followed by ELDERWOODRUFF who saidâ€”I am satisfied there is great re-joicing this day in the spirit world.We have a large assembly of per-sons here witnessing the ceremo-nies, who tabernacle in the flesh.If our eyes were opened so that wecould see those around us who tooare witnessing quite as intently andanxiously these proceedings as weare, and very probably more so,where we now behold one, therewould be hundreds of thousands.The Prophet Joseph is not dead, neither are his fellow servants now with him; they are alive and working energetically in the same greatcause; and they and the hosts ofthe spirits of men rejoice when thefoundation and every stone of atemple is laid; for they will knowin their prison homes that their salvation depends upon these things. Joseph Smith, althoughseparated from us, is one with us;Brigham Young is still with us, and I say and declare to you and toall men, that not only they, butevery apostle and all good men thatever lived upon the earth, are withus; their eyes are watching our pro-ceedings; and in fact God himselfwith all the hosts of heaven are also engaged in this work; and yet thewhole of it pertaining to the fleshdevolves upon the Latter-daySaints in these valleys of the moun-tains.Brethren and sisters, arise upand hasten the building of this Temple, and never stop until it isfinished. And then we will con-tinue on and build others else-where, and not rest from our laborswhile we tarry in the flesh; but ever labor for and guard and de-fend the interests of our ourFather's kingdom, performing ev-ery duty, remaining true and faith-ful to death, that we may inheriteternal lives. And that we maydo so, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'MILLENNIAL STAR."FEAR NOT, LITTLE FLOCK; FOR IT IS YOUR FATHER'S GOOD PLEASURE TOGIVE YOU THE KINGDOM."â€” Luke xii, 32.No. 23, Vol. LI. Monday, June 10, 1889. Price One Penny.DISCOURSEDELIVERED BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF AT THE GENERAL CONFER-ENCE, SALT LAKE CITY, ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 7, 1887.(Reported by Arthur Winter.)-[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 339.]-Read the history of ancient nationsand the dealings of God with them,as contained in the Bible and otherhistorical works. When those ancientkingdoms and peoples became wicked and corrupt, when they turned awayfrom all that was virtuous and holy,the Lord raised up prophets to warn them; and these prophets, thoughperhaps unpopular in the eyes of those with whom they dwelt, warnedthese nations and cities of the judg-ments that would overtake them.What followed the warnings of theseprophets? Read of the fall of the mighty cities of Thebes, Nineveh,Memphis, Tyre and Sidon, Babylonthe Great, and Jerusalem itself. Allthese great and mighty cities and na-tions were warned by the servants ofGod of the judgments that would overtake them. Did the inhabitants of those cities believe the words of the prophets? They did not. But didthose words come to pass? They did;and those cities were laid waste andtheir inhabitants destoyed. Thus the words of the prophets and inspiredmen were fulfilled to the very letter,not one jot or tittle failing unfulfilled.And yet the infidel says there is noGod. These same prophets and pa-triarchs also saw, by vision and reve-lation, our day; they pointed out the generation in which we live, and theyall declared that, in the latter days,the God of heaven would set His hand to gather together His peopleand establish His kingdom. TheRevelator St. John also declared whatshould come to pass in the latter days.In the 14th chapter of Revelations hesays:"And I looked, and lo, a Lambstood on the Mount Zion, and withHim an hundred forty and fourthousand, having His Father's namewritten in their foreheads."These one hundred and forty-fourthousand were sealed out of all the 
 354  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.twelve tribes of Israel, because they were righteous in the latter days.Following this, John says:"And I saw another angel fly in themidst of heaven, having the everlast-ing Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every na-tion, and kindred, and tongue, andpeople,"Saying with a loud voice, FearGod, and give glory to Him; for thehour of His judgment is come."Again, John says:"Again there followed another an-gel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen,that great city, because she made allnations drink of the wine of the wrathof her fornication."Following this, he speaks of the reaping down of the earth and of the judgments of God which were to come upon the inhabitants thereof.In fulfillment of the declaration of St. John, the angel of God has flown through the midst of heaven. He hasdelivered the Gospel of Jesus Christto the inhabitants of the earth, andrevealed unto them the word of the Lord. The Holy Priesthood had alsobeen restord. This Gospel was to bepreached "to every nation, and kind-red, and tongue, and people." It hasnow been preached almost sixty yearsâ€”from the organization of the Churchuntil to-day; and in fulfillment of the revelations of these inspired Prophets and Apostles, a multitude of people are to-day gathered together in thesevalleys of the mountains. In fulfill-ment of those revelations I stand to-day in this Tabernacle, which the Prophet saw was to be built upon thetops of the mountains, as a coveringfrom the heat and the storm. In this Tabernacle to-day, also, are ten thou-sand Latter-day Saints, which is a witness to Jew and Gentile of the ful-fillment of the promises of God. Yetthe infidel says, "Behold, there is noGod." The man who says there is no God is a fool. We are here in fulfill-ment of prophecy and revelation. Wehave received the Gospel of Christ.The kingdom of God has been organ-ized. It is rolling on; and it willcontinue to roll on until this scene is wound up.Now, I want to give a little exhor-tation to my brethren. Brother Geo.Q. Cannon touched upon a very im-portant principle this forenoonâ€”aprinciple which has often rested uponmy mind; that is, with regard to thespirits that surround us. He saidthat one-third of the hosts of heaven were cast out because of their re-bellion. I suppose we may say thatat least one hundred thousand mill-ions were cast down from heaven to earth. Where are they? Some arein Salt Lake, some in New York, some in Amsterdam, some in Constanti-nople, some in Jerusalem; in fact,they are in every city and hamletwherein the inhabitants of the earthdwell, and especially where there are any Latter-day Saints. And whetherthere are one hundred or not to everyman, woman, and child, there areenough of them, at least, to labor forour overthrow. I say to my Coun-selors, to the Apostles, to the Seven-ties, the High Priests, the Bishops,and all men who bear the Holy Priest-hood, do you suppose these devils are around us without trying to do some-thing? Are they asleep? Have theynot a work to perform? I say to mybrethren who bear the Priesthood, wehave got a mighty warfare to wage with these spirits. We cannot escapeit. What will they do to you? Theywill try to make us do anything and everything that is not right. These devils would be very glad to make meand my brethren think we are greatmen, smarter than anyone else; todivide us one against the other, and to cause us to seek to confess ourbrother's sins instead of our own. Weshould, therefore, watch ourselveswell. I should do this; my Coun-selors and the Apostles should; weall should. And unless we are unitedtogether, as has been said before, weare not the Lord's. But to-day wehave certainly manifested a unionhere that the world is not acquainted with. We have, however, a mightyresponsibility resting upon us. Theeyes of all the heavenly hosts are upon us. The eyes of Father Adam,and the patriarchs and the prophets,both ancient and modern, who havegone to the other side of the veil, areover us. And if our eyes are open tocomprehend the things of God, wecan comprehend our responsibilities; 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 355we can comprehend the powers of the Holy Priesthood and the relationshipwhich we sustain to God. We cer-tainly should humble ouselves beforethe Lord. We should labor with allour might to build up the kingdom of God in what little time we have to spend here in the flesh. Our aimis high. We aim at eternal life; weaim at immortal glory; we aim at aplace in the celestial kingdom of our God, with God and Christ and thosewho have kept the celestial law. Inorder to get there, we have got tokeep the same law that has exaltedthose who have gone before us. Thisis not our home. We were kept inthe spirit world until this generation,and have been brought forth, throughthe loins of Joseph and Ephraim, tostand in the flesh and to bear off thekingdom, to hold the Holy Priest-hood, to do the works of righteous-ness, to build temples, to redeem ourdead, and to attend to those ordi-nances which the God of heaven has declared we shall perform. This isour work. We have a long eternitybefore us. But all of us will have tomeet at the bar of Godâ€”the righteousand the wicked, those we are livingand those who are dead.This is the condition of the Latter-day Saints. I hope that we mayescape the power of the enemy. Aswas said here this forenoon, it mattersbut very little what may take placeoutside of Zion, or outside of the kingdom of God. The God of Israelholds the destiny of this nation; Heholds the destiny of this people, andof all men on the face of the earth.They are at His command and in Hispower. He will hold this nation, asHe did Jerusalem, responsible for the course they pursue with regard to theLatter-day Saints. We also will beheld responsible for the course wepursue. The Lord has led this Church from its organization until the presentday. He will lead it until the comingof the Son of Man. He is not goingto desert His people nor His cause.But it is our duty to plead with theLord, remember our prayers, keep ourcovenants, and walk perpetually be-fore Him, that we may have His favor and blessing resting upon us.I wish to say, with regard to the rising generationâ€”the sons anddaughters of the Latter-day Saintsâ€”that they should take the counsel oftheir fathers; they should honor theirparents, and honor God, and re-ceive such counsel as is given untothem by wise men. I think manytimes that our children do not com-prehend the position they occupy.They do not comprehend what liesbefore them. Their fathers are pass-ing away. Yet this kingdom has gotto remain on the earth until thecoming of the Son of Man. This work has got to follow their fathers; it hasgot to rest upon the sons and daughtersof Zion. I have a great desire thatthe institutions which have been or-ganized in Zion for their welfare maybe blessed; that our sons and daugh-ters may attend the Primaries, theSabbath schools and Mutual Improve-ment Associations, and unite togetherin these societies, that they may re-ceive the benefit of the same.Brethren and sisters, God blessyou. Let us labor with one heart and one mind, and make our wants knownunto the Lord. Let our prayersascend unto the ears of the Lord ofSabbaoth, and they will be heard andanswered. I know that if we are blessed, if we are preserved, and ifwe are saved, it is and will be throughthe mercy and blessing of God. I know also that inasmuch as we willobey His commandments we will re-ceive His protection and blessing.Zion will arise. Zion will be clothedwith the glory of God. Zion will beredeemed. Zion will be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. TheJews will be gathered home to Jeru-salem. And the promises and pro-phecies concerning bo[t]h the Jews andthe Saints of God will all have theirfulfillment in the earth. My prayerto God is that we may be true and faithful to the end of our days, andthat we may magnify our calling asApostles, Elders, and Saints while wedwell in the flesh. Amen.God sometimes gives us friendship as the scaffolding of our lives, and when ourcharacter is built up He removes them.
