Dear Brother:  Again I embrace the opportunity of writing you. I am thankful to state that I am still well, and  that the elders, though some are not robust, are all able to  travel and perform their du- ties.

He through the weakness of the flesh yielded to the temptation of the adversary, and made improper overtures to a young Maori woman. He did not commit himself, but ac- cording to his own confession would have done so had a  favorable opportunity pre- sented itself. He seems fully to realize the gravity of his mis- take, and is suffering the most bitter remorse. It is a most de- plorable affair, and is some- thing that has been carefully guarded against ever since the opening of this mission among the Maori people as we fully realized how disas- ENDENTRY astrous it would be to the cause of truth should any of the  elders be found guilty of a  violation of the law of chas- tity among this simple-minded and confiding people, but the long dreaded evil has at last befallen us. Just how detrimen- tal this sad affair will prove we at present cannot tell, but I fear that it will be some- time before we regain that implicit confidence which the natives have hitherto placed in us as servants of the Lord.  We shall endeavor as we have ever done to show in the most emphatic way possi- ble our disapproval of such conduct, and fervently pray to God to counteract the evil influence that the ENDENTRY Muriwai N.Z.

All of the Elders are well except Bro. J. H. Burton whose lungs seem quite deeply affect- ed.

Our brethren laboring in Aus- tralia have been somewhat crip- pled in their efforts to do good through a scrarcity of tracts with which to work.

The mission is divided in- to districts or conferences, with  towo or three elders in each  district.

It seems to be one of the great tests of the latter days, and doubtless will prove such to some of our people; but at present it apears to be more of a trial for our enemies than anyone else. Although it is ENDENTRY can be conveniently done, and the number of elders diminish- ed, I think it would be much better for the interests of the mission. I am confident that as much would be accom- plished, and the elders would labor with more satisfac- tion to themselves and the saints. Besides this, there would be a great saving of time and means.

Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dear Brethren,  I anticipated a remittance of 3 returns fares (£90.0.0) for the last three Elders goining home, viz H. D. Haight who sailed Feby 27, John H Burton who sailed Apl 23rd and Jos S. Groesbeck who left for home by way of Europe on 30th of last month; These Elders have all filled good missions in this land. In returning them I had to borrow of Bro. Hardy £40, which with the £50 which was sent me some months ago made up the Sum. I hope it will not be longer than another month till I can pay him.  Enclosed please find the Statistical Report of this Mission which I have not at present an opertunity of comparing with the last one, but will say that it like previous ones contains names which should be eliminated to the extent of consider- ably reducing the total, by increasing ^the^ deaths and excom- munication totals, as numbers who have been  baptized have went off and never returned, having either died or apostatized, but it will be some time before this can be regulated so that the reports ENDENTRY will correspond closely with our exact numbers.  Our Anual conference was held at Te Rahui Waiapu Valley which is at the Eastcape. The Southren districts were well represented, but only the Elders came from the northren. Our meetings were well attended the large carved Maori house being crowded in nearly every meeting. It was held on the 8th 9th and 10th of April. From the reports and my personal acquaintance can say, that while the numbers in the mission have been decreas- ing, yet many of the Saints are increasing their faith and diligence and are not near the children in understanding they were upon coming in to the church, anvery many of them have kept themselves Straigt. I am happy to say, since they first received the Gospel, and give promise of being so unto the end and Shows the results of the good labors in this land not only of those "who planted", but those who have been "watering", as well as manifesting the Grace of "God who giveth the increase" and is a source of Joy and thanksgiving to those who labor here. We have been much troubled with the vice of gambling, ^especially on horse races,^ amongst this people, and where they have been dealt leniently with in this matter it has generally resulted in drunkeness, adultery, etc. In endeavoring to stop it, some have been excommunicated, where they ENDENTRY have defiantly persisted therein, in the district where the latter course has been pursued and it has been nipped in the bud, success has seemingly attended, and this evil is well under hand ^in those districts^ at present And the Elders generally feel that it is the better course to pursue. Yet our home mail brings news that this evil is rappidly on the increase at home, and those indulging therin, does not seem to be called in question; In fact it appears that some who should be examples to the people because of their position's are leading they way. And the question naturally arises in our minds, wether we are justifed in dealing with this people for this offence, when it is not a question of fellowship with the ^more experienced^ Saints in Zion.  The Saints here were anxious to have the Doctrine and Covenants translated into their language, but when I gave them your advice upon it they seemed willing to let it rest, but asked if the Ready Reference could not be printed in their language I told them I would refer the matter to you. And will added that if it was printed with the Book of Mormon references, which are in small type figures in the compendium, it would no doubt be of much benefit to them and to the Elders laboring here. ENDENTRY In Australia four Elders are laboring, but with little success further than keeping a live the few members in that vast country, and warning the wicked inhabitants thereof. Two labor in victoria and two in Queesland and at last report ^in^ both places they were keeping bachelors hall when at head quarters. The few Saints in that land appear to be very poor and scattered, and the greater part of them very week in the faith. And it is really questionable in my mind whether we ought to keep that part of the mission up  If you could send me a few hun- dred blanks forms ^for^ Statistical ^reports^ they would be much appreciated.  I believe all the Elders in the mission have good health, at least so far as I know, and those on this Island left our conference in good Spirits. I now have a very fair personal knowledge of the condition of the Mission, having visited most of the branches to do which have traveled about 3000 miles by on  horseback and several hundred by Steamer and rail.

Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother,  Your favor of Feb. 27th came duly to  hand. The Elders referred to therein arrived safely,  and were present at our Conference, just closed.  The two drafts, for £91.12.8, and £10.1.3, came to  hand, and were duly forwarded to the Bank.  The notice of reduction probably is too late to apply  to Elder I had  previously sent unto him his fare from the amount  on deposit. In relation to the reduction I beg to  submit that the amount ^named^ would be sufficient if  parties ^were^ sailing from Sydney for Salt Lake, but releases most frequently find Elders in  their fields of labor, far removed from either of these  ports, requiring from £1 to £4 to reach either of them,  so that the former allowance left a margin ranging  from $£25 to Nil, after necessary hotel expenses, in  Auckland and San Francisco, were paid, but, in cases  where the returning Elders resided far from Salt Lake  and releases found found them at the farthest points  from sailing port, even the former allowance was  ENDENTRY inadequate. In cases where there has been a  margin of any considerable amount it has been  found almost indispensible, to enable the Elders  to make themselves presentable for travelling, for  which reason I have not felt justified in recommending  a reduction of the fares.  I hope to make arrangements with one of the  Saints, who is going to Zion this month, for an exchange  of money, whereby I will obtain sufficient funds, at  your last mentioned rates, for the return fares of  Elders E. Atkin,  (respecting which I wrote you Feb. 13th) drawing an  order on you for the amount, viz: $500.  Should I succeed, the order will be presented to  you before May 17th. In case that it is not presented  at that date, you will please forward the return  fares for above-named Elders, but If, upon consideration  of the foregoing, you should deem it proper to  remit a larger sum, the balance may be forwarded,  if the above-mentioned order is presented.  I shall require four Elders to leave San Francisco, Aug 18th, amongst which, if possible, I  would like another of our old Maori missionaries,  who learned the language. ENDENTRY President Paxman will be able to advise you  respecting those who labored under his direction.  Elders Andrus will  return to Zion this month, accompanied by three  families of Europeans Saints, numbering about  17 souls.  A native brother and his wife have  importuned me very earnestly to permit them  to accompany me home, with a view of  permanently locating there.  The husband speaks enough English for all  practicable purposes, and is very industrious and  economical. They have been very exemplary  members since their baptism in 1884.  I feel that they would be contented and prosperous  in Zion, but do not wish to encourage them  without your permission, and I mention it  now, that, in case you sanction their gathering,  they can make preparations after your advice  reaches me.

There is a marked  improvement going on with those who are faithful in this land.  Preparations are now being made  for our April Conference to be held at Te Hauke and the Saints and Elders are looking forward  to that event with much pleasure.  1893 has thus far distinguished itself, ^on these islands^ in the  peculiararity of its weather and the number of its earthquakes it has thus far produced.

In the main the Elders seem to sense the  responsibility the Lord has placed upon them in by calling them to preach repentance and warn mankind. And are endeavoring to perform this  labor of love as the Spirit directs that their  garments may be free from the blood of this  generation.  We feel that the  Lord is still softening the hearts of the enemies  of Zion as is manifested by Judge Zanes recent  decision in the church suit, the granting of  am^n^esty, dismissing of old cases against our  brethren, and the general disposition of the press and people to deal more freely with the saints. We have watched with no little interest the recent political contest in our Territory and while we  regret the spirit of strife and bitterness manifested  by many of the saints when carried away with  the excitment of debate wherein crimination and  recrimination was indulged and offensive person- alities were substituted for argument, yet we think experiences of this nature are necessary, sooner or a later, are necessary to qualify the  saints to assume that high position among the   ENDENTRY great care should be exercised in selecting those who  are first advised to go, to avoid if posible murmuring  and dissatisfaction on their part till they be come  thouroughly established.

And while the immediate results of their labors, many times, are not very encouraging. yet upon the whole we feel very grateful that every thing here in the mission is ass prosperous as it is, for there are truly many good, warm hearted, whole souled Saints in this mission, but it requires wisdom given by God to deal with a people whose minds are so invironed by the traditions, ^superstions,^ and habits of their race, which are not readily comprehended by those not closely associated with them. The gospel is striking these fetters from their minds. their old priesthood with its witchcraft etc is fast becoming a thing of the past. The young men now work ^6 months^ on an average, each year for the Europeans at Sheep Shearing etc, most of them have entirely adopted european dress and many of them the manners and ways of their white neighbours. Free government schools are imparting the English language to the more ambitious children. So that it would seem not far away in the future when the remnant of the maori people will readily assimilate with the most advanced races of the earth. I believe the Maori is the most self reliant, industrious, and progressive of the brown polynesian races, which ENDENTRY for home about Nov'r 5th.

Opportunities for doing effective ^work^ among the Europeans of these  lands have, certainly, never been so good, during the last  12 or 15 years as at present.

H. Thorpe.  I believe I wrote  in my last for return fares for Elders Taylor  if not please send by return mail.  Five ^six^ Elders will be required by march and can return with the  "Monowai"  ^on her next trip,^ if the present boats keep on the line  in their present order.  On my arrival here  President Bingham told me that there was a  balance yet due ^you^ on an ammount  loaned this mission on publishing the Book  of Mormon but I find no account of  the same and would be obliged for a state- ment of the acc't.

The construction of the language has become quite clear and words are coming to me every day so that I can get on full as well now as any of the Elders left in the mission with whom I am acquainted. Many of the Elders who come here never learn the language good and some of them scarcely at all as a rule those who are fluent speakers in English succeed well  in the Maori.

Elder Ridges being appointed to the Australian district continued his voyage by the same boat, after a five hours rest in Auckland.  We will require ^by return and mail,^ £60.0.0 as return fares of  Elders D. B. Stewart whom we expect to  release to go home by the next departure of the "Monowai," which will be Decr 28th.  "The Ready References" have been prepared for publication  and placed in the hands of the printer, the first bound coppies  of which we may expect by the last of Decr. Money has  already been collected for the printing and by the time the first  lot is bound we will probably have enough in hand to  meet our obligations therefor. After the sale of the first  thousand ^coppies,^ it will be on a safe business footing.  We have agitated, to some extent, the purchasing of  a small printing press, for the purpose of issuing a paper  in the maori language, and, the printing of what tracts  we may need in the mission.

I think the  Saints here would subscribe quite liberally of their means  towards this end, both, for its establishment and maintenance,  however, we do not feel like moving out in this direction  without your advice, the more so as none of us have had  experience in this line of business. Should you feel to en- courage the undertaking, providing it can be made self  supporting, any advice as to kind, size, and probable  cost of press, will be greatly appreciated. Upon the receipt  of your reply to this, if favorable, the mission will be im- mediately canvassed and if the results warrant will proceed  at once to make arrangements etc., in which case we would want  a practical printer sent out, the younger the better, so he  could acquire the language, thereby, greatly increasing his useful- ness.  The measles have swept over this country, and,  though, usually very fatal with natives, who are ignorant  of its nature and proper treatment, the mortality has been very  light indeed, as compared to its former visits to these Islands.  The general health now, of both Elders and Saints  is good so far as I am advised.  The "female franchise" and "local option" has made the  present session of N. Z. Parliament very lively and caused  a quite a ripple on the political sea of the colony and  I might say of Australasia. The success of the former  measure is now in accomplished fact, and may be  regarded as a very radical departure for a British Colony.

Dear Brethren:  I have pleasure in ac- knowledging your favor of Sept 12th. The Six Elders therein named had a very pleasant and speedy voyage arriving here in good health on the 6th.  I anticipate releasing Elders Milton Bennion and C. W. Taylor on Decr 25th to return to Zion and therefore will need £60.0.0 for their return fares, by return mail. The £180.0.0 mentioned in your last came Safely to hand.  We will need five ormore Elders by April and will probably be best to have them come on the "S S Monowai" which is expected to leave Sanfrancisco March 3rd 1893.  The latest accounts from the most of the district are quite encouraging and we regard the future prospects ^as being^ good.  Ever praying the blessings of God upon Zion and her inhabitants.

The local option Bill will succeed, but no doubt, but in such a form that but little good can expected from it.  Although this is a new country, "Strikes," "labour troubles" and "unemployed" are not strangers here. Money has exercised a far greater influence here in the settlement of this country, than, what we have known, especially, in the western part of America. Land monopoly, or the mopoly of the natural facilities, make it an easy matter for Capital to dictate its own terms, which means the enslavement of the masses. What a contrast between this and the ^Spirit,^ method, and ultimate results characterizing the settlement of the Saints in the once forbiding, but now, beatutiful and happy vales of Zion.  These is a strong feeling growing here in favor of the single tax system, so ably advocated by Henry George of America and looking to the naturalization of the land. The Gov't here are proceeding somewhat along those lines by a system of a grauated land tax. The law being adjusted so that the larger the holdings the greater their proportionate amount of tax.  Of course wise legislation may, to some extent, modify existing evils, but, only modify, for their final abolition, we must look to something that will tear from the heart of man the incubus of selfishness and hate; immerse int in a solution that will dissolve its calloused surface which has been formed by ages of accumulated wrongs and oppressions; then, implant within it a love that is as broad as humanity, and as induring as eternity; inspire it with a knowledge of man's brotherhood and God's fatherhood, ENDENTRY W.

He had been delirious for three days before death, yet he recognized and called each of us by name upon our arrival but soon after relapsed into his former condition being lost to surroundings.  He died on the 31st of August and will be shipped by the outgoing mail.  Elder Stanford and Hawkes will accompany his body home.  His death sickness is traceable to getting wet through a canoe capsizing.  Elder Chipman was making good progress in the language ^during his six months here^ and gave promise of becoming a very efficient missionary.  But it has been otherwise ordained.  The sympathy of the Elders for his wife and relatives, and sorrow at parting with a true friend has cast a gloom over all. Yet ENDENTRY while we sorrow we realize that our kind Heavenly Father doeth all things well, and we think it better to be called to labor on the other side of the vail when active and faithful here, than when in those conditions of indifference and worldly mindedness which many of the Saints have drifted into.  Bro Stanford will be able to give you all the particulars.  I have instructed him to telegraph you from Sanfrancisco and have you convey the sad inteligence to the bereaved family.  The expenses here have been quite heavy as you will see by the enclosed bill.  Bro Stanford takes £10.0.0 to pay Rail way charges on the other side, how much it will require I have no idea, but he will telegraph for more if he needs it.  He is also to let you know when he will be in Ogden so that relatives or others can meet him there.  I supupose the family will pay all the expenses above the usual return fare  Bro Hardy kindly came to my aid in money matters.  next month I expect return fares,  as per Bro Reynolds advice, for the two Elders going now the balance as per bill of £44.4.10 I will expect by return mail.  In March 1885 ^an^ Elder Hill was released from this mission by his own request on account of ill health  he clained he ENDENTRY had money to take him home so that nothing was  paid on his return fare.  I was then presiding here and subsequently learned that he borrowed £10.0.0 of one Brother Fryer with a promise to pay it in 3 months.  Elder Charles Heybourne of Cedar acquainted me with the case and has been doing all he could to have brother Hill pay it, but thus far without success.  I think that the amount ought to be paid with at least Five Pounds interest added.  And as nothing was paid on brother Hills return ^fare^ and as it seems he refuses to pay this sum and did not have the manhood to report it at the time and ask it to be paid ^then^ I now feel it my duty to report it to you knowing that you will take that course that will be proper under the circumstances. The amount of interest mentioned above is computed at 5 per cent the legal rate here.  Brother Fryer is still in the church but I am in- formed that this has been quite a trial to him.  Elder B. Hamblin. has had sore eyes Since April sometimes better some times worse. he  is now here in Auckland to ^have them^ be treated the dDoctor Says he will be able to cure them in 4 weeks.  Should he however not obtain relief, will release him to return I hope however this will not be necessary with this exceptions the Elders are all well or were at last accounts.  On my last visit to the ENDENTRY Southren districts a system of home missionary work was inaugerated, calling into active labor ^service^ an number of the Native's; recent reports from those district in relation to this labor is very gratifying.  I believe in the majority of the branches we can report an improvement whilst in some of ^the reverse^ is the case.  A long wet disagreeable winter is now drawing to a close and we are greatly in hopes that during the coming summer we will be able to accomplish considerable good and be able to make favorable reports.  With best regards I remain  Yours etc  W. T. Stewart  P. S. Three more Elders will be needed by the Boat leaving 'Frisco in December  W. T. S.  Handwriting Changes The money should be sent.  And I would suggest, a letter be written to bro Hill respecting the payment of that money he borrowed, and urging him to meet his obligation.  A few words sent to R. W.

I am glad the subject has come before you again, and I pray the Lord ^that^ all that He requires may be accomplished ^in^ the holy land.  I am strongly impressed with the idea that a competant elder ^or elders^ should be instructed ^by the presidincy^ and sent to Turkey to plant the germ, and it seems to ^me^  that the work of the elders ^in years past^ is about to culminate in a foot hold being obtained in Asia Minor to successfully platnt the gospel among the people.  Bros Musser and Herman are very intellegent men, but they need a more experienced man there to direct in these important matters.  Bro. Musser needs help. I do not know to ^how we can^ send him help from this mission, we are weak in numbers and especially in experienced men. Scarcely a man in the mission who has ever been in the missionary field before.  If Bro Empey and B. S. Young could do  something at or after Conference for to collect a fund for the Turkish mission it might be a good thing.

I have no confidence in my health. Sometimes without warning I feel like I would faint away, circu- lation very feeble, I fast, and that hurts me. I try to be care- ful in eating and drinking, but there is something wrong with my breathing aparatious when the air is muggy and cold ^I suffer^ I mention this to ^give^ a reason why I cannot get down to work as I would like to.

The three will have spent three years and four months amongst the natives, and Elder Browning two years and six months amongst Europeans.  Notice of the death of Elder Edward Stevenson caused a degree of sensation and some sober reflection, but only to conclude, in the light of the Gospel, that our loss in his gain, and the condition far more to be envied than mourned.

Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  We are in receipt of letter dated Jany. 5th reporting five more Elders for this mission. They have undoubtedly arrived Sydney ere this. We can use them and also others.  Regarding the £197.0.0 to come next mail, oweing to the ill-health of Elder Moroni Lazenby it was deemed wise to release him to return home by the March boat. Elder C. H. Embley was also released to accompany him. The former has been here something over two and the latter some- thing over three years. I have arranged with Bro. Hardy to use £50.0.0 of the above amount for their return fares. And it is desired to release four more Elders at our April Conference in the Wairarapa which according to usual allotments would make in all £150.0.0 more, which we would be very pleased to receive not later than April.  It will be seen that our report is not made out as suggested by letter dated Jany. 4th Viz. giving births and deaths of males and females separately. And 'tis now too late to change or cor- ENDENTRY them except there should hapily be an immediate and radical change!  The epistle from yourself and colaborers to the Maori saints, was read to our Conference, and copier of same presented to Tamahan, Hoani Rangi Te Kaiwaho, Pu Rakaw and other outside leading male and female Rangatirai who were lending much to the support and success of our Conference, which brought forth much favorable comment. The remaining copies were given to Presidents of Conferences for distribution among the saints. It seemed almost to overjoy the grey-haired colored veterans, to see that you entertained not but words of counsel, good will and blessing for them, though they did not see as we do; and that so far as we were concerned, we wished to be at peace with, and have love and good will for all men, and gave efficacy to what I had told them, i. e. that you had not sent us out here as enemies of man or creed, but only to be enemies of all unrighteousness.  I announced to the Conference your ap- proval of the saints sending geneologies to Hirini Whoianga for him to be kept in the Temple work. I think it will be the means of inspiring them much in that direction. ENDENTRY rect it and reach you for conference. The breth- eren inform me that this is according to Elder Jensen's late instructions. We will endeavour to follow out your suggestions in the future. I would like to ask if new baptized members are to also appear in column as members received?  Elder Almond Thomas Butterfield is out here without any Mission Certificate, or License to preach.  It was formerly the custom to sustain the general and mission authorities at our district as well as mission conferences; but has for some cause been discontinued. What would be your feelings and wishes in the matter?  I understand that the original Maori form or ceremony of marriage is for the parents or relatives on both sides to come together and mu- tually consent to the proposed or desired union; or, if between influential parties of different tribes, the chiefs of the respective tribes would mutually consent; and the parties begin living together as man and wife.  In some parts of the mission the bretheren are wholly ignoreing the Maori form of Marriage and disposeing of unions thus brought about as cases of adultery and fornication and making ENDENTRY We were a little disappointed to learn it would  be necessary to make shift, for the present, with  the help we have, no more missionaries having  been called for these parts; however we don’t wish  to complain, but will be pleased to accept more  when you see proper to send them. In view of  this Elder Andrew Smith Jr. has been released  from the Presidency of the Tasmania Conference and  appointed to preside over the New South Wales  Conference which will locate him at Sydney, and  suburbs. He has had some 18 months experience  on the mission and is an able, energetic laborer,  and we think will fill that position with credit,  though it was with some degree of reluctance that  we moved him from his former field.  Two Elders should be released in July  next and seven in September. We would therefore  be pleased to receive means in time for the nec- essary remittances. £25. per head is the usual  allotment.

At our Annual Conference we had 28  Zion Elders present and about 500 saints and  friends. The new building was opened with  feast, ceremonies and dedication. Besides which  in the four days ten meetings in the native tongue,  for in neighboring European towns, and our  Elders meeting. The weather was good, and  the Lord indeed blessed us with a time of rejoic- ing, and we hope much good will grow out  of it all.  Besides your epistle we were favored  by one from our beloved brother and former Prest.  Wm Paxman and one from the Maori Association  which assisted materially in making our Con- ference as success. The outcome of all was the  location of the Conference there for the another year,  and permanent invitations to come and go at will.  In fact the leaders seem almost what we  would call "Dry land Mormons" and I suppose  held so on account of their position and desire  for continued popularity and influence.  I resume my travels through the mission  attending Conferences, going, in about ten days, to South Island.  We anxiously look forward to time of recieving ENDENTRY them a matter of fellowship. I would be pleased to hear an expression from you as to wether or not the above is the proper course to pursue; or is the ceremony of the Maori nation in this res- pect entitled to the same respect and acknowl- edgement as that of other nations?  Making such unions a matter of fellowship may have grown out of the counsel of former Presidents to try and educate the Maori people up to a better ceremony in order to draw as broad a distinction as could be between marriage and living in adultry; as perhaps half of the European population are doing, in some of the cities at least.  Would it be improper for priest, teacher or deacon to perform the ceremony of marriage out here?  We have a case here where one of our sisters mar- ried a radical, narrow contracted roman cathlic european. She sayes she refused positively to give up her religion, and told him if he married her he would have to marry a "Mormon" which she was and would continue to be. He succeeded, however, in disgraceing her before marriage; and, seeming- ly would only be too pleased to have her excomuni- cated; but she earnestly pleads for secret baptism, as he wont consent to her being rebaptized, and promises, as far as is in her power, to tend her ENDENTRY redacted ENDENTRY news of Conference at home, and the valuable instructions we will receive.

She has been virtually suspended for nearly four years.  The europeans are enemies to this people spir- itually, temporally, physically and morally; and, seemingly, take delight in draging them down to death hell and destruction.  My policy has been as long as I could see something good in a person—some honor or prin- cipal as a foundation to build upon or hopes of a  future outcome, to hold onto them, and perhaps I am too much that way. But often the case when we have decided that mercy ceases to be a vir- tue and put them on the outside, the Spirit of the Lord still continues to strive with them and they arent satisfied until they get back in.  I have just received of Bro. Thomas Finlayson, West Jordan, $25.50/100, per H B. Hales, and given him an order for same which I trust will be agreeable with your feelings; and can be deducted from above amount, or go towards return fares of next company, a couple of months later, as you prefer.  The semi-annual conference of mission ENDENTRY redacted  I mentioned in my ^last^ letter to you regarding the illness of Elder Thos. Clayton who is laboring in Adelaide So. Aus. His companion has since in formed me that he is very low, being irational and at times heavily preyed upon by evil influences— in fact it would seem that we might hear of the worst taking place at anytime. It appears that for some time previous to his being confined to his bed something weighed heavily upon his mind by night and by day. ENDENTRY held 5, 6, and 7th Insts. was a very interesting and in- structive one, and particularly noted for the gen- eral peace and quietude that prevailed in meetings and on the premises in general. Ten meetings were held in the three days with twenty-three Zion Elders in attendance, and between two and three hundred saints and friends. The Elders meet- ing held on the 8th continued six hours and a half; and was one long to be remembered by all in attendance. The time was spent in singing, praying, bearing testimony, asking and answer- ing questions and in giving general instruct- ions, all were melted down until there was- ent a dry eye in the room.  I expect to start south in a few days, holding district conferences down through and reach Wairarapa for annual conference of mission April 4th 5, and 6th  We are just now undertakeing to, locate Elders at Adelaide, South Australia, where we hope to get an opening and do a good work; as the people, as near as we have learned, are of a nature in their surroundings and occupations, that ought to take to the Gospel quite readily.

Since that time and to last accounts he has been irational.

The company of five Elders arrived at Auckland December 15th in fair health and spirits.  The company of eight reached Sydney, Australia, on the 5th inst. Three were assigned to labor in Queensland. The remaining five reached here on the 15th inst., feeling consider- ably jaded. They report a very rough voyage from Vancouver, and also from Sydney. The water broke in upon them and most all their luggage was wet and more or less damaged. The blanks, which you sent, were amongst the rest, their appearance being mat- erially affected, but will still answer the purpose for which they are intended, and I will endeavor to carry out the instructions when Elders are released to return home.  We are also in receipt of Bro. Reynolds' ENDENTRY yours of Aug 4th just now to hand I  will take pleasure in carrying out the suggestions therein contained to ^the^ bringing about of a division of the  Australasian Mission and give you farther particulars by the next Frisco Mail.  I am now enroute to attend the Waiapu Conference, we having just closed a most excellent confer- ence in the Poverty Bay Dist.

Gardner did not express himself very favor- ably after his short visit, or call in, on way home; however, inasmuch as there seems to be a general good feeling and willingness to hear us pretty much all over the world, if you feel that the time has come when they should be offered the Gospel, I will be pleased to carry out any suggestion you may be led to make re- garding the matter.  The same condition also exhists with regard to the Chatham and Stewardt Islanders.  We have had a dreadful storm here of late, doing much damage on land and on sea, causeing much destruction of property and some loss of life. 'Tis again raining yester- day and today.  The health of the Elders generally is pretty good at present, so far as I have learned except the two to whom I have referred as having been released. Elder Moroni Lazenby's lungs were affected before he came out and have been growing worse until I thought it wise to release him. However, he has been very suc- cessful in getting inoto the language and ENDENTRY favor of the 7th ult. advising us of five more Elders to arrive here the fore part of next month. We shall be pleased to  receive them, and a number more "5's" there- after. In fact you may accept this as an application for a number more than intimated at last writing, as there is a general demand for Elders pretty much all over the mission, and particularly amongst the Europeans. If things continue as they now seem, I think we can, with propriety, double our force which at this writing, stands at sixty-one in number.  We are endeavoring to ascertain from  Presidents of Conferences, how many more are really needed and can be profitably used in each Conference. Will report the number later on, perhaps about April.  It does not look as though we will get the Statistical report off by this mail, as some of the District reports have not come in correct, and poor mail fac- ilities require time to get corrected ones, but will endeavor to not be later than next mail.  A few Europeans are talking of ENDENTRY Sept 14 1897  Post - script.  After further considerations I feel satisfied in my mind that Elder Andrew Smith Jr. is the proper man to take the presidency and watch-care of that part that you suggest as being known in the future as the Australian Mission. and as you leave it to me to make the appointment you may con sider him the man that will be appoint- ed.  His address is Newtown P. O. Sydney S N. S. W. Australia. I will at once notify him to that end and we will confer together to the bringing about of the proper division according to suggestions contained in your letter and our best judgement.  I see no reasons why the name by which you suggest this part being known in the future, viz: "New Zealand Mission" ENDENTRY has performed a firstrate work.

ENDENTRY emigrating with next company of returning Elders in April or May next.  We are not preaching the gathering to the natives, in fact 'tis with difficulty that we hold them down and keep them from emigrating. We are, however, encouraging the old people, particularly the chiefs who are just ready to depart this life, to work their genealogies up and make them a matter of record so that when they go they will not take this invaluable information with them. A number are doing it commendably well, and some are forwarding their genea- logies to Brother Hirini Whanga, Zion, for him to do the work at once. Perhaps you  would feel like suggesting as to the advis- ability of this being done to any great extent; or would each tribe be apt to be more satis- fied, in the future, to do their own Temple work, when the Lord opens up the way for them so to do? If not, it would furnish something for Hirini to do, and that much would be accomplished. ^Which I think is all right. J. F. S.^  Most of the Elders are enjoying first rate health and spirits.

Dear Brother:  In addressing you a few lines concerning the interests of the work in this land, I deem it unnecessary to go beyond President Gardner's return, for he doubtless gave you a detailed report of it to that date.  Two days after parting with him at Sydney, Australia, I embarked for this island. Had rather a rough voyage, being caught in a storm, having our upper topsail yard broken, and the deck overflowed for two days, but no permanent damage was done. The ship, passengers and cargo all safely yeilded up at point of destination.  I visited and held conferences in the Poverty Bay districts, all of which were fairly attended, and, as we think, a success and product- ive of much good.  Continuing on to this place I met Elders John H. Sargent, on their arrival, Oct. 12th, their companion, Elder Alma C. Lambert, having stopped to ENDENTRY Auckland New Zealand Aug. 24th 1897.  Prest Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City Utah.  Dear Brother: We are in receipt  of your favors bearing date of June 21st and  July 8th; also draft for equivalent of $200 as reffered to in the former.  Elders Holbrook have arrived safely and been assigned to their  fields of labor. Elder Bunot having  just met me when I received your request for  his immediate release, it was at once acted  upon; and he in connection with Elders Bryant Ashby left for Zion  21st Inst. Per S S Warrimoo. The former had  been in the mission little short of two and a half years and the latter little rise of  that time both laboring among Europeans.  Elder Bunot learned prior to leaving that his dear mother departed this life the 7th ult.   hence her desire to again look up on her worthy  son in mortality, would not be granted.  One week previous, per S. S. Aorangi, Elders  Jedediah G Casper left  the mission to return to Zion. The former  having spent two years and a half among ENDENTRY Europeans, the latter about nine months, and  was released by his own request on account  of ill health. He had undergone a medical  examination and been told nothing short of  an operation would give permanent relief;  and that should be attended to without delay:  he wished to be at home with his folks to  have it performed. He had urine and other  troubles of an inward nature. He was pro- vided with the usual amount £25 to get him  home but having been here so short a time  I was a little at a loss to know what wou- ld be your feelings in the matter, and he felt  himself that it would be proper to return  it; and that he would prefer to do, said  he would remit that amount at the office S.  L. City.  Will forward by this mail blank filled  out of list of released elders as previously  instructed. Should you have any sugges- tions to offer regarding filling out blanks  in the future I would be pleased to except  them.  We would be pleased to release seven  Elders to return by the boat leaving here fore  part of November next; and in order to  make neccessary remitances for return fares ENDENTRY labor at Sydney. They were apparently in good health and spirits, and reported having had a fair journey from Zion. Both Elders were appointed to labor among Europ- eans on the South Island.  A letter previously received from you, stated that blanks would be sent by  the Elders for me to fill out on releasing missionaries. They have not yet been received, the last company of Elders having no parcel for me or the mission. I will take pleasure in carrying out your suggestions according to my best judgement when the blanks arrive.  After assigning the Elders to their fields of labor, I went into the Ngapuhi country, which includes the Bay of Islands districts, from which place I returned last Wednesday. The natives in those parts are, as a rule, very poor, depending largely on gum digging for a livlihood, hence very widely scattered over the gum fields. However we managed to get enough together at different places to hold some fifteen meetings, besides other house to house work, and were blessed with the privelege of adding eleven souls to our numbers.  The mail awaiting me on my return ENDENTRY Auckland, New Zealand Wednesday May 26th 1897.  Prest Wilford Woodruff P.O Box "B" Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  We are in receipt of your favors bearing dates of March 19th and April 26th. Also the Draft for £153 3/4 sterling. I appreciate the information given in reply to questions submitted.  We are also pleased to learn of the pros- pects of more Elders in August and October. It  would be to the interest of the mission if they were already in the field, getting a start in the language so to be better prepared to replace the prospecting releases mentioned in my last to you.  As regarding the propriety of dividing the Australasian Mission, I have felt for some time that a move of that kind would contribute  largely to causing the work to progress far more rapidly in Tasmania. As the Maori people and work are of so peculiar a nature is to wholly absorb one president's time. And at the same time the prospects are  very encouraging, at present, in those parts, and  could undoubtedly be followed up ENDENTRY we would be much pleased to receive £100 ster- ling before that time, if it be consistent  with finances on that end. I borrowed £10 ster.  of Elder George Jarvis and applied it on return  fares of the last company, giving him order on  you for that amount which I trust will  meet with your approval.  I am sorry to have to state that I have  just received a letter from Adela- ide, S. Aust. dated 2 Inst which reports his  companion, Elder Thos Clayton, in a very bad  condition of health. Apparently caused from  over study and the wrong kind of diet. He is  said to be troubled with indigestion and  dyspepsia, and his nerves are somewhat aff- ected, all of which makes him low spirited  and despondant at times. He was however  a little better after a special fast which  had been held for him. I have written  to be kept thoroughly posted regarding his  condition and if he does not get around rig- ht away will doubtless change him to other  parts or consider the propriety of releasing him.  The rest of the bretheren were in firstrate con- dition of health at last report, except that  now and again, one gets too fleshy out here  and is afflicted with boils. Most of them have ENDENTRY pretty well recovered from the itch.  Regarding the elders that it is expected will  come out in October but not stated how many.  We will be very badly in need of ten Elders  besides the three who have just arrived, to  replace those who have just left and who  we expect will leave in November. And  shall be much pleased to receive that nu- mber as soon as practicable and if one of  them could be a competent book keeper and  accountant, we would like to be iniciating  him in to succeed Elder Castleton in the  clerkship of the mission as his time is  near expireing.  There are two or three places on the  mission where some opposition and bittter  hatred have been manifested. A Corps of  Roman Catholic Irish policemen made  some threats over the brethren tracting  and attempting to travel without purse  or script in Queensland but by carrying  the matter up a little higher the Elders were  guaranteed justice and protection, and this  matter seems to have pretty well blown over. Now and then too, some minister has to  explode a little through the news papers,  but upon the whole, seems to me there is a ENDENTRY reported enough additions to make, in all, some fifty-two, most, or perhaps all of which  took place during the month of October.  The Elders, as far as reported, at present, are in good health and spirits, so we feel that the Lord is working with us, and abundantly blessing our labors. 'Tis not our greatest trouble to get people into the Church, for we have a great many fornication and adultry cases to contend with in this mission, which together with Maori Tohunga (sorcery work) com- prises most of the causes for people leaving  or being put out of the Church.  Twenty-two Elders have already been released and returned home during the present year, and it is now expected that eight more will return by the December boat, they all having performed two and a half years missions amongst Europeans, and three and a half amongst the Maoris, which is perhaps as long as any Elders are being kept out now days, at least, so far as I am posted. As yet there have only been fourteen arrivals to replace those who have returned, which has decreased our numbers some, and to a certain extent crippled us, for the way the Lord has swept away prejudice from the minds ENDENTRY closely with very satisfactory results.  Our last report showed a total of 21 souls in New South Wales and 82 in Queenland, total 178; 4 organized branches; 2 Sunday Schools and a  Mutual Improvement Association. A number of  additions have since been made in every place except Victoria. There are now 21 Elders in  those parts, as follows: Tasmania 4; Victoria 2 South Australia 2; New South Wales 5 and Queen- sland 8. Each conference president has, some  time since, written me suggesting the propiety of more Elders. And in N. S. W. and Queens- land particularly have pleasing openings been  made, and desires been manifested for  Elders, which have not, as yet, been respond- ed to, for no other reasons than the lack of  enough to deem it wise to spare some from elsewhere. I have been very anxious about the work in those parts for some time, being  desirous of taking every advantage of these favorable oppertunities as they present themselves. And for the lack of sufficient time to visit the Continent in person. I have recently been led to write a general letter for guidance of  the European work and working Elders, with a  ENDENTRY very good feeling among the people in general  regarding us, and what we represent. And  many are free to admit and comment upon  the great change that the maories in particular  who have embraced the gospel have under- gone through our teachings and labors.  The Latter Day Saints and their religion seems  to be getting better understood and more  kindly looked upon.  Since first of July, I have visited and  held conferences and other meetings in Wai- kato, Wai- rarapa Districts having good meetings and  in most places made some additions. July 11th we had the pleasure of baptizing  one Pepene a great chief of the Ngatimam Ngati-tama tribe,  and elder brother of our late respected brother  Reha Aperahamoa in whom we sustained  such a loss. Tis throught this one will come  to the front and contribute largely towards  making up the loss.  We have just closed a nice interesting  and we think profitable conference of the  Porirua. I go to hold conference in the Mahia,  Waiapu districts. Ever praying for your enjoyment in ENDENTRY of the people, and inspired them with a desire to know more concerning us and that which we represent, it appears to me that we could, with great propriety, increase our number of Elders to a considerable extent.  President I were united in this conclusion after our tour of the mission. If, therefore, the nine new Elders which he mentioned, get here between now and the end of the present year, we will have no trouble in assigning them fields of labor with- in the present borders where the work is being carried on, and shall be pleased to get twelve more here before our Annual Conference in April. I can also indorse Prest. Gardner's application for the two school teachers if it meets with your approval for us to start a few schools for the benefit of the natives.  Concerning the experienced Elder to be permanently located at Sydney, if I could learn his name ere his arrival, it might act as a preventitive against any mistake over here. It will be materially to the interest of the mission for all Elders to take tickets for Auckland, N. Z. except when differently ad- vised in special cases.

Since its issuance I have heard from a number of the Elders, who have fully endorsed the move, and expressed themselves as having felt, for some time, the need of a more thorough and systematic plan being  adopted.  Elder Andrew Smith Jr., whom I men- tioned in my letter dated April 10th, is 33 years of age, and has labored in the miss- ion since Sept. 1895 energetically and satis- factorily. Should you fully decide to divide the mission, you may be led to either appo- int him to the presidency of the new one, or  send an Elder from Zion whom Elder Smith  could labor with and assist in getting thoro- ughly initiated into the work, while he  would yet remain in the field. Elder Smith seems to be endeavoring to preach the Gospel without "purse or scrip,"  and do his duty as a  servant of God.  Bro. Te Aroha branch, Hauraki District, and an influential chief, died fore part of this month. It was  ENDENTRY concerning remittances for the company return- ing in December, and as we do not get another home mail in time for them, I have taken the liberty of arranging with Brother Charles Hardy for the amount, with a slight interest, until it comes, which I hope will meet with your approval.

With kind regards to yourself and colaborers, I remain, Your brother in the Gospel.  E. F. Richards  See over ENDENTRY a great blow, as he was a great support in those parts and much respected by many without, as well as the saints. Another  great chief of the Manauatu district, has also  died recently. He had formerly belonged to the  Church but been excommunicated.  A number of the Elders and many Maoris, have a burning itch. When nothing else presents itself they fill in the time scratching. 'Tis very annoying indeed while it lasts, but wears off  in time. Aside from this the Elders are, I beleive, in fairly good health. Elder Petersen's removal to Mahia seems to have improved his health some.  Since my last writing, a terrible storm and flood has taken place on parts of the  island, notably Hawkes Bay District, where some few people lost their lives. And thousands of cattle and sheep, as also other property damaged and destroyed. Very many are left in a state of destitution. Pleased, however, to  note that none of the saints lost their lives and but few were damaged seriously, as far as learned.  With earnest prayers for your good, and  well being in your advanced years, even that ENDENTRY I fear it is not wise to send so many Elders to those Islands. A fewer number of men, well qualified to preach the gospel and defend the truth would be better. Elders without good qualifications or bright minds should not be sent to these distant and expensive missions.

Since that time we two  have been traveling together, having already  visited three conferences, viz: Tau- ranga and Waikato.  On the 15th Inst. we expect to start  South and make a complete tour of  the Mission, that Elder Richards may  get a thorough understanding of all its  workings. The Elders, as a rule, are enjoy- ing good health; there are, however, one or  two exceptions, where the brethren are troubled  some with their lungs, and symptoms of  rheumatics.  During the month of June upwards  of forty baptisms were reported, and  prospects bid fair for many more in  the near future. Upon a whole, the  ENDENTRY Mission is perhaps, in a fairly prosperous  condition.  A company of Elders and saints  expect to leave Sydney, bound Zionward,  on the 10th of September next.

ENDENTRY Woodville, New Zealand, Aug 2nd 1894.  President Wilford Woodruff and members of the  First Presidency.  My dear brethren,  I take pleasure in writing to you  and reporting the condion and necessities of the  Australasian Mission.  The good work is progressing nicely, and the Elders are reporting satisfactory results. I am travelling continually, endeavoring to visit all  the Maori districts, thus aiding the brethren laboring  amongst the Natives, and visiting personally as many  branches as possible.  In addition to our Maori districts, we have now ten  European districts in which Elders are especially assigned  to labor in spreading the truth, and the work is being  vigorously pushed amongst the Colonials.  A new European district has been formed in the  North, with the city of Auckland as headquarters, and  Elders Jedediah Goff are now located  there.  The Elders in Tasmania give a very  encouraging report, having recently baptised a few members, and they are now calling for more help.  In the Victoria and New South Wales, we have now eight elders at  ENDENTRY work, and I anticipate good results from their  earnest efforts.  We have also two European districts  on the South Island, one of which I have recently  visited, and the prospects there are very good.  In view of these facts, I have just called the Mission  Clerk, Elder B. Goddard, to make a few months tour  of the colonies, visiting all the Europan districts,  and assisting and encouraging the Elders laboring in  the above mentioned fields.  Adjacent to Chatham, and Raratonga Islands, on all of which are large  numbers of natives, whose language is very similar to the Maori.  The latter two groups are under the  New Zealand government, and I am very anxious  to get the work started there.  If it is possible for you to send a few Elders who have a knowledge of Maori, I can use them  advantageously, in connetion with Native elders,  in opening up these new fields.  I recently received from you a number of pamphlets,  "Succession" by B. H. Roberts, for which accept our thanks.  These have been distributed amongst the Elders. Elders Stevenson, Armstrong and others, who  left San Francisco, May 3rd, arrived safely, and have  been assigned to their fields of labor.

Dear Brother: It is now several months since writing you from this Mission and it is with pleasure that I embrace this opportunity. Through the blessings of Almighty God, the labors of His servants have been pros- pered in this land, and it pleases me much  to be able to make an encouraging report. The brethren, with but one or two exceptions enjoy the best of health and all are in the  possession of the spirit of their holy callings. In some districts, where hitherto the Elders  have been able to do but little, the Lord has  opened up the way, that now very effectual work is being accomplished. In the month  of September forty one baptisms were report- ed, and prospects are most encouraging for many more in the near future.  I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of  $500.00/100, for the return fares of Elder Goddard and Company. On account of not having received money for the return of Elders Burton and Barrow, I have been compelled to  borrow their fares from Brother Thos. Finlayson. ENDENTRY 1. I duly received draft for £50.16.4, as per your  letter of April 2nd.  I used the one fare on hand, as  originally intended for Elder B.

Ellertson, in case the latter has to be released on account of  ill health.  3. Will you also send me as early as possible, another company of Elders—two for Tasmania and four for New Zealand. Those for Tasmania  should obtain tickets through to Sydney.  This company is required for European work,  and the Elders should be recommended to equip themselves with tracts and suitable literature. If you can send a few experienced Elders amongst these it would greatly facilitate the  work in the large cities.  4. We have great difficulty in obtaining tracts andc. for this Mission and it is too expensive to print them here.  Our funds will not permit us to do this at  present, as we have not yet fully settled for printing  the Maori Ready References.

The Elders and Saints throughout the mission  are well, and are in the enjoyment of the spirit of  the Gospel. It gives me great pleasure to report that  the truth is spreading in this distant part of the  Lord's Vineyard. The time for our April Conference is  fast approaching and we hope to have a season  of spiritual rejoicing.

We are all well, with the exceptions of Elders Stephenson who has been aflected with sore eyes for some time; and Elder  Huntington who has been Ill ever  since his arrival in the Mission, therefore I deem it  wisdom to release him to return on the August Steamer  as he has not been able to do any Missionary Labor as yet. He is troubled with liver complaint. And his head and  eyes are bad, and he cannot study he will therefore Return  in company with some of the Saints.  The rest of the Elders are  fully enjoying the Spirit of their Labors and I am  happy to say the work of the Lord is progressing  nicely in this Mission. New openings are being made  and people are inviting the Elders to come and hold  meetings in their school Houses, in a few instances, and nearly all the Elders are asking for more help. I haven't yet heard anything in relation to the last company of Elder ordered. Nor the return fares for  Elder Goddards Company  no doubt it will be hear  next mail.  It will be nesessary to release Elder  James Barrows in the Month  of September. Therefore if you will kindly send  ENDENTRY Tamaki, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand—April 9th 1895.  President Wilford Woodruff,  Beloved brother,  I take pleasure in informing you that  our Annual Conference has just closed and we  have been blessed with an abundant outpouring  of the Spirit of God. In our Sacrament meeting  we had over 200 Visiting Europeans and  hundreds of Maoris came from all parts of  New Zealand. Thirty seven elders from the  various Conferences in Australasia were  present and the reports were highly satisfactory  and encouraging. The work is progressing  nicely in all our fields and we rejoice in  these evidences of divine favor.  A Company of Elders and Saints will  leave Sydney on May 18th for Vancouver in charge of Elder B. Goddard.  X We shall require, as early as possible, eight   more Elders, to fill vacancies that will shortly  occur. Four will be required for Maori work  and four to labor amongst Europeans.  I also need an earnest experienced elder  to take Supervision of The Conferences in  Tasmania, with whom I ENDENTRY me the money for their return fare as soon as  posible; as Elder Hardy is geting a little short  at present and I am owing him £100.0.0 for return fare  of Elder Goddards Company.  If you can spare another  Company of Elders we can use them to an advantage in the Mission ast there will be a large Company of  Elders ^released^ about the last of the year and the first of  the new one.

X In a short time it will be necessary to  release Elder Charles Peterson so please  forward the requisite funds by return mail.  On account of your remittances  for elder's return fares being so different,  I am not sure what amount you desire  me to pay to them. I have only paid the  last two companies £25 each and if this  is not correct please settle with the Elders  at the Office. I feel impressed, however,  to state that many of our Elders, are almost  destitute when their terms expire, especially  our Maori elders who are compelled to  purchase clothing andc before they can commence  their return journeys.  Many of them also are great distances  from Auckland and Sydney, and in some  cases it costs about £4 to reach the  port for American Sailings.  I shall also esteem it a favor if  you can possibly arrange to remit  ENDENTRY funds in time for me to settle with  the Elders, when their time expires as  I have been compelled to borrow from Bro.

Barker and Charles D. Fox, on the 6th inst. wWhen they came to Sydney. On account of the  missunderstanding of the arrival of the S. S.  Miawerra, they had no one to meet them either  by person or letter. aAlthough I received no word of  their coming still I was impressed there might be  some one or more. Elder Barker did not realize  any effect of Sea sickness. but elder Fox was  very bad at times and gave elder Barker to  understand that if the rough weather continued  much longer he was afraid he could not stand  it but he looks acceplright, and although  he was so bad, we had a hearty laugh after  it was all over and the pittiful story was  related to us. There does not seem to be much  sympathy extended to sea sick persons, as  very few die but the reverse they seen to  get so that many, at least, are better able to enjoy  their meals than before the ordeal they are called  to pass trough.

Some of the elders have had poor health lately but when the hot weather is over, as there is nothing serious in their illness’es, they will be all well again.  The work is quietly making way into the families of the honest and I believe we can look for some fruits of the labor performed by the elders. there have been, I believe, eight baptisms performed and several children blessed since I last wrote you and look for more in the near  future.  I am well and desire to do my part. I go to Brisbane in company with elder Barker.  I hope each of you are in the enjoyment of good health, and pray God to bless you.

I would also be pleased to have six Elders sent to take the places which are and will be vacated by the releases of four soon. I will not say anything to them regarding the arrangments before I get word from you.  There is much that could be done here in Australia if Elders were here to the amount necessary. It seems a few do not cause enough stir in getting the people to take the interest I would like to see. There are many, from the work the Elders are doing, believe what we teach to be the truth and do not join because of the great prejudice and the slowness ^of the work^ and many dwindle away from that which we have been able to instil into their minds by there not being enough encouragmint; from our labors.  upside-down text Scott W Anderson arrived safe at Sydney after a pleasant voyage A.

There are no particular complaints from the elders on this Route, but many would like to return by Sanfrancisco. A. S.

I would be pleased if such could be the case, that that number could be sent to Sydney.  To show you how little a few Elders are known by the masses, Since the last opening up of the work at Sydney, ^they^ knew nothing about Elders laboring in Sydney.  There was a very untruthful piece published about our people and we deemed it wise to answer it, and the people were surprised to know that we had been here so long, and had been doing the work that we reported in answer to the piece, and it took the Editor, (from the surprise of our being here) several weeks to get over what he had done and get on his wicked head again to give us another blowing up.  We had the satisfaction of getting our Articles of Faith published and a few good words of advise regarding our cause and felt we had done our part without slander.  We have at the present 21 Elders in  the Mission and could work many more if we  had them. The Elders are all enjoying good health and are doing what they can in allaying prejudice, gaining friends, and the Lords is blessing some with fruits for the labors performed. ENDENTRY In the City of Launceston, Tasmania, Elders have been laboring for some time and have met with no apparrent success until ^quite^ recently. The subaurbs are being tracted and the work is going on nicely, there are about 16 members and quite that number who are preparing themselves to have the ordinance of baptism performed that they can be properly initiated into the  true fold of Christ. There are some very nice people in the Island of Tasmania and I believe a good work can be done.  I feel that the Elders in this mission are doing the Cause justice, the stamp of love is written ^in^ the demeanor of the great majority of them and is growing stronger with them day by day, and I am thankful to our Heavenly Father for the privilege I have of laboring among such noble sons.  I also thank God and you that I have been call to this far Southern Clime, and that such honor is placed upon me, it is  something I never looked for. I like the calling of travelling Elder too well to ask for any thing higher but as I understand that we are expected to improve, and if we prove faithful in the exalted possitions we are called to fill we will be blessed. otherwise if the office and calling is desecrated, a curse instead of a blessing is given. ENDENTRY Answered WCS  P.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Friday April 22nd 1898.  President Wilford Woodruff.  and Councillors,  Beloved Brethren:  Your letter to me with instructions (to me) as to what you desire will be carried out to the very letter if possible. I do not think I will be able to leave Sydney before the 18th of June, as the work to be done will keep me here (in the Colonies) until after the leaving of the May boat.  The agency at Sydney have not received any instructions from Mr Coyle up to date. Two mails have come since I received letter from Geo. Reynolds informing me of the arrangments made between you and the agent at Vancouver. I believe the changs^ing^ of the agency, from the Huddard Parker Co. to the Burns Philip's S.S. Co at Sydney has caused them to overlook the latter part i.e. the instructions they should have sent to Sydney. I have two men released from  their labors and if word does not come before the next boat leaves it will very much inconvenience them. If they have overlooked it entirely I may be delayed in my return, there have been two other elders released to leave Sydney June 18th ENDENTRY Regarding the traveling to the different conferences, they being so far apart, the nearest is 500 miles Shanks povies are very  good but it takes quite a time and I believe a great amount of time wasted to walk and this would not reach them all, it is an expensive mission for the size to do any traveling. Prest Richards and myself were up to Brisbane and were well paid for our visit The cheapest way is by boat more time etc saved The mission is in a poor condition to keep a President if traveling expences are paid unless he gets help from other sourses he will either have to be content to remain in one place and pay his way when he is able to. I would like you to advise me what to do in this matter. I believe if the Elders and Saints were visited once in a while much good could be done and would pay for the expence in time.  The following address could be given to Elders coming to Sydney, Australia. No 30 Malcolm Street Erskineville Sydney N. S. W. the above address is our headquarters.

After all business is perfected between elder Barker and your humble servant, I will make some inquiries concerning some of my relatives who live in these parts, who I have not had addresses of until the   last Vancouver mail, then I will be pleased to return home.  I feel greatful for the ^your^ appreciation of my labors in the missionary cause, and the little good that has been accomplished I appreciate, and in return I give our Heavenly Father praise and Honor for it all. I know the Lord has been with me in my travels and work among the people, (Saints and strangers) for my thick head would never have been able to do the little good that has been pleasing for me to look upon, then it was not me it was the Lord, I being His humble Instrument through whom He did the work.
