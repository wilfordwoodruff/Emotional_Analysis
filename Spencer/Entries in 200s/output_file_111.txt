There  is begining to be murmerings through  the camp and much wickedness that  the Lord is not pleased with the Saints appear at the presant time some as the children of Israel did while in the wilde- rness &amp; the Nephites on this continant  at times they would forget their God  and turn to wickedness. And while in council this evening the High Council  asked President Young for some teaching He arose and said he had no teaching  to give at present but to cry repentance to  to the people. And he would begin with the High Council they must repent and  the camp of Israel must repent or it  would not be long before a man could  not bear the priesthood upon his head in there midst and the Twelve would  have to flee out of there midst and  go to the mountains which would  be a great curse to this people H C Kimball  arose and related a dream said he  was travelling with President Young  vary fast and they thought they could  fly and they flew through the air  and lit down upon a large plain  and they saw it coverd with large  groups of snakes and they had to  jump from place to place to get over  them but they lay still while they  were in there midst Brother Young   ENDENTRY  were full of evil and speaking evil of  them but would not grumble while  they were present    ENDENTRY December 16, 1846    on his house and they moved into it    ENDENTRY December 17, 1846    in the evening some of the bishops  made a report of there wards, we herd  a letter read from Br Holebrook  at the Punka Nation who had been to search out a road to Fort Larame    ENDENTRY December 18, 1846    John Sherman Fowler ready to go to  Missouri to get a load of Provisions  for the family's use in the evening  I went to the store to trade out my  bill of goods consisting of shugar  Molasses, Salt, Salaratus, cotton cloth  drilling, striped, shirting flannel cotton  batting shoe thread coffee, tea, a lantern  3 primmers calico and s amounting  in all to $blank  returned home Mrs Woodruff took  out of her family box her portrait to  see the likeness of her little Joseph we  had buried    ENDENTRY December 19, 1846    Fowler ready to start he crossed the  ferry about sun set   ENDENTRY December 20, 1846    appointment I met with our ward for an organization according to the arangment of the Camp and to teach instruct and rebuke as the case may require we met at Br Ensigns at half past 10 oclock I opened the meeting by singing and prayer and addressed the people I confessed my own sins and in some respects the sin the 14 were varily guilty before God of many  wrongs I warned them to repent before the Lord or a scourge would come upon them. I was followed by Elder G. A. Smith and O Pratt. Br Smith spoke of there treatment towards me in not build- ing me a house as I had been sick said when there would be another temple built they would be pulling the buttons off my coat to get into the temple to recieve their blessings &amp;c and taught much good doctrin, asked if they had yet got there inheritances sealed to them on the earth and in heaven if not they had yet still sumthing to do O Pratt addressed us also with much interest spoke of the trials we were called to pass through and that the hand of God was in it and it would all work together  for good if we made a right use of it  we were informed there was to be a  meeting at the stand so we dismissed our meeting &amp; repaired to the stand  whare we found a large congregation of saints and President Young was  addressing them   ENDENTRY  that flowed from President Youngs lips as he addressed the people and called upon them loudly to repent he said you must stop your swearing, you must stop your cheating, you must stop your lying, you must stop your stealing you must stop your horedoms you must stop your back biteings, speaking evil of the Twelve speaking evil of me, you must stop these things &amp; put away your wickedness or you will be damned, you will be destroyed you will be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword, and you will fall to the ground and I warn you and fore warn  you of these things if you do not repent yes councellors, High Priest and Elders here in the Camp of Israel will say I will de damned if I will pay my tithing or if I will do this or that, if God was like man He would hurl you down to Hell &amp; let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercy ownly keeps you out there are many here that are corrupt and rotton at the core and I have no more  fellowship for them than I have for John C Bennett if I fellowship these  things it will drag me down to Hell with you and I will not do it brother Joseph  being a vary merciful man bore with these things untill it took his life but I will not do it men get led away by  degrees untill the devil gets possession of  there tabernacle and they are led captive at the will of the devil and now I say that those who are calculating to continue   ENDENTRY  go no further with this camp they had better  go to Missouri and spend the rest of ther time with the gentiles for I can swear  to them if they go with us &amp; continue there wickedness there heads shall be served from theie tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall go and  have no tabernacles to dwell in the truth of the matter is there are many places we pass through that have been the slaughter ground of the ancient Nephites and Lamanites and the spirits of Devils are hovering around it and if you are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at their will for if you are not governed by the spirit of God you will be by the spirit of the devil. and if you are governed by the spirit of God while  in such places and they cannot enter  any of you they will try to enter your cattle your beast, for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine in ancient days. I had rather go to the mountains with the Twelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those who will not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness and serve the devil for if we continue  with this company and they do not repent the righteous will fall with the wicked. There are people now in this camp who are stealing hay and wood and I know who they are will I fellowship them no  I will not and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they think we are   ENDENTRY  ourselves but it is not so and Joseph suffered much from the same cause because he knew of the rascality and wickedness His enemies and many of the saints thought he was guilty of it himself the truth of  the matter is those who are leading the House of Israel while in the path of there duty know the wickedness that is among the people it cannot be hid from them for they are in vision all the time. I will now look a little upon the other side of the question I will say however  that if we are a mind to be subject to the will of the devil, Death, Hell and the grave we may be &amp; bow down to it all the day long or we may have perfect  power and triumph over it. who am I surrounded by, by men who  into covenant with God, have recieved endowments in the temple and are called to be saviors upon mount Zion, to save who our Fathers and Israel clear back to Father Adam who are still lying in there graves and waiting for the redemption of there bodies through your instrumentality, then will you curs, swear, lie, steal, commit adultey and take the name of God in vain putty saviors you would be, O shame God and  Angels would blush at such conduct. then repent and do the work appointed yoo many men are overtaken in a fault desire to repent and turn to God shall we cast such away Nay but bear with them   ENDENTRY  all at once, but have to be tried and placed  in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmost to see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we may be safe when we come into the Celestial Kingdom of God  and not do as Lucipher did the first time an oppertunity is offered rebel against God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled  down to Hell in a manner that you could not be redeemed at all and you must not sin murmur and complain while in the midst  of your trials because you have been mobed and tried even to the utmost it is no excuse for you to commit a wicked deed take the name of God in vain, or to do any evil, now all of  you quit it repent and turn to God and you shall be blessed notwithstanding I have thus reproved you I consider you the best people as a body there is on the earth and if there was any better I would go to  them and take you with them that desired to go. In speaking of the redemption of our dead I would say there are millions that died from the days of Adam to Christ that are waiting for there bodies to be raised but few arose in comparison to the number at the resurrection of Christ and they were some that had the priesthood or fulness of it sealed upon them after making many  other usful remarks he closed by blessing the people believing they would repent The remarks of president Young made a deep impression upon the congregation and I trust there will spedily be a refermation in the Camp of Israel   ENDENTRY  with the Twelve High Council and Bishop and herd the report of the Bishops of each ward and other business attended to.

President Young was asked if  it would not be well to send the Presidents of the seventies out He said No they would Preach the people to sleep &amp; then to Hell Now this shows me that the Presidents of the seventies the first seven Presidents are asleep and their is sumthing wrong with them. if this is the case that they would preach the people to sleep &amp; then to  Hell Then this body of Counsellors are guilty of Great sins either of  omission or Commission &amp; I would advise Joseph Young to cut off  his council &amp; drop them &amp; appoint men in his stead who are full of the Holy Ghost &amp; will act with him &amp; assist him. Now we will take up his council &amp; look at them. Now here is brother Levi Hancock why he will   of God in it than their would be in a Cabbage Leaf. Now If you would  preach the people to sleep &amp; to Hell you are guilty of some great Henious sins either of commission or omission you have either committed Adultery or some other sins &amp; you ought to be droped. Here is Brother Harriman now if you will preach   ENDENTRY  or omission have committed Adultery or some great sins &amp; you ought to be  droped. Brother Harriman might preach a month then you might put it all in the Eye of a Cambrick Needle &amp; there would be as much room in it as there would be for a bulfrog in the Albert P Rockwood if  you would preach the people to sleep then to Hell you are asleep dead, &amp; guilty of committing Adultery or some great sins there is no sap in you you are as dry as an old musk rat skin &amp; you ought to be droped. And Zerah Pulsipher if He would preach abominable sins of commission or omission of committing Adultery or some great sins &amp; ought to be droped &amp; I will say the same of Benjamin Clapp &amp; H. S. E to be droped.  I think that Brother Joseph ought to Cut them off &amp; prune  the trees around him how can the body be kept awake &amp; Healthy when the head is asleep &amp; dead. It has been with great reluctance that I have voted for the presidents of the seventies for a long time And I will say  to these seventies if your Presidents have gone to sleep dont you go to sleep. but keep awake. If your Presidency have committed Adultery  &amp; done wrong &amp; committed great sins that will damn them dont you do it but wake up. Is there any man that i has been ordained a councellor to Joseph Young if so I do not  know it but each man was ordained a president &amp; is under as  much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling &amp; do his  duty but they never think of such a thing of taking any burthen upon their shoulders but leave it all for Joseph Young to do &amp; he has to drag them along when I vote for Rockwood, Pulsipher, Harriman &amp; Levi Hancock I do it vary reluctantly, &amp; I have done so for years &amp; now I want to have you to wake up &amp; do yor duty. There is no life spirit sap or Juce in Hancok, Harriman pulsipher, &amp; Rockwood's preaching, to more than there is in an old mummy. These are the kind of men that are your presidents. And the seventies as a body are as dry &amp; dead  as an old chip &amp; you are as tight as the bark of a tree. It is the duty  of the seventies to sustain Brother Joseph Young to furnish him with  food fuel &amp; rament that He may give himself to the work of the min- istry who has esstablished the president to take men who were in the battalion to be presidents I would take men who were full of  the Holy Ghost I do not care whare the Hell they come from. This is what I want I say again the Presidents of the seventies are asleep  and if they do not wake up they should be cut off. He spoke in the power  of God &amp; the gift of the Holy Ghost    courted any woman but his wife &amp; she courted him. He justified himself  in a measure. He was followed by Benjamin Clap who said He had not committed adultery &amp; if he hag had gone to sleep he had done it since  he came here for he was not asleep when he came home. He intended  to serve God with all his heart &amp; was willing to go through this territory with his pack upon his back &amp; preach the gospel. A. P. Rockwood received the chastizement &amp; ment to repent &amp; go into the waters of Baptism as soon as He got a chance    were under the Twelve. I told him I would like to bear testimony to what He had said. I Arose &amp; said to the people that I wished them not to trifle with the teachings of President Grant for what He had said was true he had shot arrows of the Almighty among the people  and if they did not wake up &amp; take the warning &amp; repent of there   ENDENTRY  God nor with his servants who hold the keys of the kingdom &amp; are called to lead us I called upon the Presidents of the seventies &amp; all the seventies to begin this hour to call upon God for the Holy spirit &amp; advised them  to stop work &amp; give themselves to prayer untill they could get the spirit of God I had the spirit of God in speaking unto the people I told them I had recorded what Elder Grant had said &amp; I should keep it on record.

The spirit of God is like a flame among the Leaders of this people &amp; they are throwing the arrows of the Almighty among the people. J. M. Grant is  pruning with a sharp two edged sword &amp; calling loudly upon the people to wake up &amp; repent of their sins. The Elders who have returned are full of the Holy Ghost &amp; power of God the account which they give  of their missions &amp; the dealings of God with them have been vary  interesting &amp; edifying unto the people    was followed by Bishop Hoagland who spoke well he reproved Brother  Ballantyne for the saying the Head or Bishop of the ward was out of the way &amp; while the Head was wrong the body would be wrong. The Bishop said He had done the best he could &amp; He did not feel to take the reprof    except.    by that Circumstance that no man in the Church has a right to reprove  any man that is over him in the priesthood if he sees that he is really doing  wrong He has a right to go to the man &amp; pray him to desist but He has  no wright to speak of it to any one ownly to report it to those who are  over him that the evil may be corrected by proper authority    Edification.

He reproved his councellors &amp; said they were asleep &amp; did him no good if he got any thing out of them He had to go after them they should come to him He said the people were not sufficently  awake he wanted them to wake up &amp; get more of the spirit of God He spoke well    ENDENTRY October 11, 1856    of Joseph  Young &amp; John Young came into the office &amp; herd read what we had  written &amp; corrected what was wrong.

Again what does the saying mean that sayes all shall be damned that does not keep this Law  unto whom it is revealed does it mean that they shall take more wives than one.
