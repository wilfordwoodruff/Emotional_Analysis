The Camp of Israel  is divided into streets, blocks, and wards  and a bishops appointed over each ward to  see to the poor, widows, and to keep an  account of what each man is doing and   ENDENTRY the Twelve, High Council and Bishops  meet each week to do business and  to carry business teaching and instruct- ions to the Saints in each ward. There  is begining to be murmerings through  the camp and much wickedness that  the Lord is not pleased with the Saints appear at the presant time some as the children of Israel did while in the wilde- rness and the Nephites on this continant  at times they would forget their God  and turn to wickedness. And while in council this evening the High Council  asked President Young for some teaching He arose and said he had no teaching  to give at present but to cry repentance to  to the people. And he would begin with the High Council they must repent and  the camp of Israel must repent or it  would not be long before a man could  not bear the priesthood upon his head in there midst and the Twelve would  have to flee out of there midst and  go to the mountains which would  be a great curse to this people H C Kimball  arose and related a dream said he  was travelling with President Young  vary fast and they thought they could  fly and they flew through the air  and lit down upon a large plain  and they saw it coverd with large  groups of snakes and they had to  jump from place to place to get over  them but they lay still while they  were in there midst Brother Young   ENDENTRY said the interpetation was the people  were full of evil and speaking evil of  them but would not grumble while  they were present    ENDENTRY December 16, 1846 ~ Wednesday   16th I put father Woodruffs ruff  on his house and they moved into it    ENDENTRY December 17, 1846 ~ Thursday   17th I drew hay to day met in council  in the evening some of the bishops  made a report of there wards, we herd  a letter read from Br Holebrook  at the Punka Nation who had been to search out a road to Fort Larame    ENDENTRY December 18, 1846 ~ Friday   18th I spent the day getting Br  John Sherman Fowler ready to go to  Missouri to get a load of Provisions  for the family's use in the evening  I went to the store to trade out my  bill of goods consisting of shugar  Molasses, Salt, Salaratus, cotton cloth  drilling, striped, shirting flannel cotton  batting shoe thread coffee, tea, a lantern  3 primmers calico and s amounting  in all to $blank  returned home Mrs Woodruff took  out of her family box her portrait to  see the likeness of her little Joseph we  had buried    ENDENTRY December 19, 1846 ~ Saturday   19th After spending the day to get Br  Fowler ready to start he crossed the  ferry about sun set   ENDENTRY December 20, 1846 ~ Sunday   Dec 20th 1846 Sunday according to previous appointment I met with our ward for an organization according to the arangment of the Camp and to teach instruct and rebuke as the case may require we met at Br Ensigns at half past 10 oclock I opened the meeting by singing and prayer and addressed the people I confessed my own sins and in some respects the sings of the 14th ward in which I dwell for they were varily guilty before God of many  wrongs I warned them to repent before the Lord or a scourge would come upon them. I was followed by Elder G. A. Smith and O Pratt. Br Smith spoke of there treatment towards me in not build- ing me a house as I had been sick said when there would be another temple built they would be pulling the buttons off my coat to get into the temple to recieve their blessings andc and taught much good doctrin, asked if they had yet got there inheritances sealed to them on the earth and in heaven if not they had yet still sumthing to do O Pratt addressed us also with much interest spoke of the trials we were called to pass through and that the hand of God was in it and it would all work together  for good if we made a right use of it  we were informed there was to be a  meeting at the stand so we dismissed our meeting and repaired to the stand  whare we found a large congregation of saints and President Young was  addressing them   ENDENTRY The following are some of the important words that flowed from President Youngs lips as he addressed the people and called upon them loudly to repent he said you must stop your swearing, you must stop your cheating, you must stop your lying, you must stop your stealing you must stop your horedoms you must stop your back biteings, speaking evil of the Twelve speaking evil of me, you must stop these things and put away your wickedness or you will be damned, you will be destroyed you will be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword, and you will fall to the ground and I warn you and fore warn  you of these things if you do not repent yes councellors, High Priest and Elders here in the Camp of Israel will say I will de damned if I will pay my tithing or if I will do this or that, if God was like man He would hurl you down to Hell and let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercy ownly keeps you out there are many here that are corrupt and rotton at the core and I have no more  fellowship for them than I have for John C Bennett if I fellowship these  things it will drag me down to Hell with you and I will not do it brother Joseph  being a vary merciful man bore with these things untill it took his life but I will not do it men get led away by  degrees untill the devil gets possession of  there tabernacle and they are led captive at the will of the devil and now I say that those who are calculating to continue   ENDENTRY in wickedness and serve the devil had better go no further with this camp they had better  go to Missouri and spend the rest of ther time with the gentiles for I can swear  to them if they go with us and continue there wickedness there heads shall be served from theie tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall go and  have no tabernacles to dwell in the truth of the matter is there are many places we pass through that have been the slaughter ground of the ancient Nephites and Lamanites and the spirits of Devils are hovering around it and if you are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at their will for if you are not governed by the spirit of God you will be by the spirit of the devil. and if you are governed by the spirit of God while  in such places and they cannot enter  any of you they will try to enter your cattle your beast, for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine in ancient days. I had rather go to the mountains with the Twelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those who will not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness and serve the devil for if we continue  with this company and they do not repent the righteous will fall with the wicked. There are people now in this camp who are stealing hay and wood and I know who they are will I fellowship them no  I will not and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they think we are   ENDENTRY fellowshiping them and doing the same  ourselves but it is not so and Joseph suffered much from the same cause because he knew of the rascality and wickedness His enemies and many of the saints thought he was guilty of it himself the truth of  the matter is those who are leading the House of Israel while in the path of there duty know the wickedness that is among the people it cannot be hid from them for they are in vision all the time. I will now look a little upon the other side of the question I will say however  that if we are a mind to be subject to the will of the devil, Death, Hell and the grave we may be and bow down to it all the day long or we may have perfect  power and triumph over it. who am I surrounded by, by men who arhave entered into covenant with God, have recieved endowments in the temple and are called to be saviors upon mount Zion, to save who our Fathers and Israel clear back to Father Adam who are still lying in there graves and waiting for the redemption of there bodies through your instrumentality, then will you curs, swear, lie, steal, commit adultey and take the name of God in vain putty saviors you would be, O shame God and  Angels would blush at such conduct. then repent and do the work appointed yoo many men are overtaken in a fault desire to repent and turn to God shall we cast such away Nay but bear with them   ENDENTRY as God bears with us we cannot be sanctifyed all at once, but have to be tried and placed  in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmost to see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we may be safe when we come into the Celestial Kingdom of God  and not do as Lucipher did the first time an oppertunity is offered rebel against God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled  down to Hell in a manner that you could not be redeemed at all and you must not sin murmur and complain while in the midst  of your trials because you have been mobed and tried even to the utmost it is no excuse for you to commit a wicked deed take the name of God in vain, or to do any evil, now all of  you quit it repent and turn to God and you shall be blessed notwithstanding I have thus reproved you I consider you the best people as a body there is on the earth and if there was any better I would go to  them and take you with them that desired to go. In speaking of the redemption of our dead I would say there are millions that died from the days of Adam to Christ that are waiting for there bodies to be raised but few arose in comparison to the number at the resurrection of Christ and they were some that had the priesthood or fulness of it sealed upon them after making many  other usful remarks he closed by blessing the people believing they would repent The remarks of president Young made a deep impression upon the congregation and I trust there will spedily be a refermation in the Camp of Israel   ENDENTRY I also met in council in the evening  with the Twelve High Council and Bishop and herd the report of the Bishops of each ward and other business attended to.

One year ago this night  I was in Liverpool England but this night finds me in the midst of the Camp of Israel, at winter quarters in the Omaho Nation in the wilderness in the land of Joseph surrou- nded by the Lamanites who are poor wreched and miserable and have been so for many generations in consequ- ence of the sins of there forefathers   ENDENTRY According to the prophesies of the  Prophet Lehi we have been rejected  by the gentiles on this land or continant  even the land of Joseph and the gentiles  have shed the blood of the Prophets  and Patriarchs  HIRAM  and others and have sought the lives  of the Apostles and Saints and have  driven us out of their mids and  there by have rejected the Kingdom  of God with the keys, oracles, and revela- tions thereof which we have taken  with us, which remain with us  this day in the Camp of Israel and  my prayer to God is that they may  remain with us and our Posterity through all time and through all  Eternity and that the same blessings  may spedily go to the Lamanites  and that 1847 may not pass  away untill the Lamanites with  their Chiefs may begin to recieve the  gospel which the gentiles have reject- ed and cast out of their midst and  that the Lord will spedily deliver  us entirely out of their hands and  avenge the spilt blood of the Prophets  and that they may cease to spoil and  be spoiled and that they may feel  the chastning rod of the Almighty  and know there is a God in Israel   ENDENTRY AD. 1846 has been a day of  the sacrafice of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  Through the fatigues and labours  and exposers of the Saints many have  been laid in the grave I have my- self been called to part with two of sons which God hath  given me they lie in the dust untill the ^resurrection^ and I came nigh being killed  by accident by the fall of a tree  which broke my breast bone and  three ribs but through the great  goodness of God I was preserved  and have recoverd and still live  for which I feel to render the  gratitude of my heart to my  Heavenly Father and I pray my  Heavenly Father to lengthen out my  days to behold the House of God stand  upon the tops of the Mountains  and to see the Standard of Liberty  reared up as an ensign to the nations  to come unto to serve the Lord of Hosts  I Pray that my Brethren the Twelve  may be preserved to esstablish Zion  upon the mountains of Israel and  lead the Camp of Israel to a land of  Peace, health and safety all these  blessings I ask God my Heavenly Father  in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue  of the Holy Priesthood AMEN   ENDENTRY FIGURE The following is a synopsis of the travels  and labours of W.

Rockwood and England and 4  To the states we ordained 2 Elders and one seventy W Woodruff spoke to the Missionaries a short time and exhorted them to keep a Journal  of their Ministry every day of their lives He said I would advised  you to get all of your blessings written and preserve them. In writing your  Journal I do not care about your keeping an account of what you eat or drink or whare you sleep unless you should be in a Desert, in the  wilderness or on a mountain and have nothing to Eat then if the beast of  the field or Fowls or Heaven Come and Feed you as the ravens did Elisha then I would want you to record that, but I do feel to Enjoin it upon you to make a record of Evry official act of your life. If you baptize, confirm ordain or bless any person or administer to the sick write an account of it if evry man will do this the church can write a correct account of it we are not apt to think of the importance of Events as they transpire with us but we feel the importance of them afterwards we are living in one of the most important Generations that man ever lived on Earth and we should write an ofaccount of those important transactions which are takeing place before our Eyes in fulfillmen of the prophesies and the revelation of God there is a great flood of Revelations fulfillig in our day and as they are transpiring before  our eyes we want a record made of them if the power and blessings of   ENDENTRY God are made manifest in your preservation from Danger and death you should make a record of it keep an account of the dealings of  God with you daily I have written all the blessings I have received  and I would not take gold for them. I am in the Historians office and I find  it vary difficult to get or find a record of Events as they past along shuch as we want to make the History but if the Elders will take pains to write their Official Acts so the Historian can get hold of them it will be a benefit to the Church the History of this Church will remain throught time and In Eternity *   Elder P. P. Pratt followed and backed up my testimony and said he had  reflected upon this subject for years to know what a man should write and have come to the conclusion that a man should write his  official acts in the priesthood I have been sorry that I have not kept more of a Journal than I have I wish I had written evry mans name that I had ever baptized or administered unto it  is neccesary for us to keep a Journal.   * W.

You may say I am severe I am not  half as severe as the Lord wants me to be I have seen Joseph when men were in Council meetings with him and rose to leave, cut them right off from the church before they got out of the door. You grieve  the spirit tramel the spirit and it is grieved with the Confusion and interrup- tion if you do not believe this, get the spirit of God and come on this  stand and attempt to talk to this people.

Elder Dunbar sung and the Assembly was dismissed.   I met at Early candle light with the seventies and Elders in the Tabernacle the House was nearly Full the First seven presidents were present with Joseph Young presiding. President Joseph Young occupied the fore part of the meeting in transacting the busi- ness of the Quorums 70 Quorums were called upon and found to  be mostly full.   President J Young then called for a  subscription for the Seventies he got but Little   President J M Grant then arose and said I feel that there are  some FIGURE things that greeve me. President Young was asked if  it would not be well to send the Presidents of the seventies out He said No they would Preach the people to sleep and then to Hell Now this shows me that the Presidents of the seventies the first seven Presidents are asleep and their is sumthing wrong with them. if this is the case that they would preach the people to sleep and then to  Hell Then this body of Counsellors are guilty of Great sins either of  omission or Commission and I would advise Joseph Young to cut off  his council and drop them and appoint men in his stead who are full of the Holy Ghost and will act with him and assist him. Now we will take up his council and look at them. Now here is brother Levi Hancock why he will fiddle diddle di fiddle diddle do fiddle diddle dum and tweedle  diddle ta. Now he might preach a month and ther would be no more spirit of God in it than their would be in a Cabbage Leaf. Now If you would  preach the people to sleep and to Hell you are guilty of some great Henious sins either of commission or omission you have either committed Adultery or some other sins and you ought to be droped. Here is Brother Harriman now if you will preach   ENDENTRY the people to sleep and to Hell you are guilty of some great sins either of commission  or omission have committed Adultery or some great sins and you ought to be  droped. Brother Harriman might preach a month then you might put it all in the Eye of a Cambrick Needle and there would be as much room in it as there would be for a bulfrog in the Albert P Rockwood if  you would preach the people to sleep then to Hell you are asleep dead, and guilty of committing Adultery or some great sins there is no sap in you you are as dry as an old musk rat skin and you ought to be droped. And Zerah Pulsipher if He would preached the people to sleep and to Hell you are guilty of some abominable sins of commission or omission of committing Adultery or some great sins and ought to be droped and I will say the same of Benjamin Clapp and presidents words they are asleep and ought to be droped.  I think that Brother Joseph ought to Cut them off and prune  the trees around him how can the body be kept awake and Healthy when the head is asleep and dead. It has been with great reluctance that I have voted for the presidents of the seventies for a long time And I will say  to these seventies if your Presidents have gone to sleep dont you go to sleep. but keep awake. If your Presidency have committed Adultery  and done wrong and committed great sins that will damn them dont you do it but wake up. Is there any man that ins in that council that has been ordained a councellor to Joseph Young if so I do not  know it but each man was ordained a president and is under as  much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling and do his  duty but they never think of such a thing of taking any burthen upon their shoulders but leave it all for Joseph Young to do and he has to drag them along when I vote for Rockwood, Pulsipher, Harriman and Levi Hancock I do it vary reluctantly, and I have done so for years and now I want to have you to wake up and do yor duty. There is no life spirit sap or Juce in Hancok, Harriman pulsipher, and Rockwood's preaching, to more than there is in an old mummy. These are the kind of men that are your presidents. And the seventies as a body are as dry and dead  as an old chip and you are as tight as the bark of a tree. It is the duty  of the seventies to sustain Brother Joseph Young to furnish him with  food fuel and rament that He may give himself to the work of the min- istry who has esstablished the president to take men who were in the battalion to be presidents I would take men who were full of  the Holy Ghost I do not care whare the Hell they come from. This is what I want I say again the Presidents of the seventies are asleep  and if they do not wake up they should be cut off. He spoke in the power  of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost   Levi Hancok followed him and said He had not commit Adultery he never courted any woman but his wife and she courted him. He justified himself  in a measure. He was followed by Benjamin Clap who said He had not committed adultery and if he hag had gone to sleep he had done it since  he came here for he was not asleep when he came home. He intended  to serve God with all his heart and was willing to go through this territory with his pack upon his back and preach the gospel. A. P. Rockwood received the chastizement and ment to repent and go into the waters of Baptism as soon as He got a chance   J. M. Grant asked me if I had not sumthing to say that the seventies  were under the Twelve. I told him I would like to bear testimony to what He had said. I Arose and said to the people that I wished them not to trifle with the teachings of President Grant for what He had said was true he had shot arrows of the Almighty among the people  and if they did not wake up and take the warning and repent of there   ENDENTRY sins for the day has come when it will not do to trifle with the Things of  God nor with his servants who hold the keys of the kingdom and are called to lead us I called upon the Presidents of the seventies and all the seventies to begin this hour to call upon God for the Holy spirit and advised them  to stop work and give themselves to prayer untill they could get the spirit of God I had the spirit of God in speaking unto the people I told them I had recorded what Elder Grant had said and I should keep it on record.   I was followed by Joseph Young who spoke well and in a good spirit    ENDENTRY October 8, 1856 ~ Wednesday   ^FIGURE^ 8th I spent most of the day in the Young called upon  me in the evening and spent about half an hour with me.

V. Jones and others I herd a difficulty between N. V. Jones and Bringhurst stadted before the  presidency which resulted in sustaining Elder Jones and Cutting off Elder Bringhurst or disfellowshiping him. President Young had sent  Elder Jones to make led and Elder Bringhurst had not sustained him but opposed him. F D Richards and company called upon the President  to settle all their matters as Agents for the Church abroad   Presidents Kimball and J. M. Grant spent the remainder of the day in the office   Some remark were made last sunday night relative to the family of Joseph Smith President Young said I have no fears with  regard to the Children of Joseph God will take care of them  and all will be right   Remarks by W W. we have passed through another Conference and such an won I never saw before. The spirit of God is like a flame among the Leaders of this people and they are throwing the arrows of the Almighty among the people. J. M. Grant is  pruning with a sharp two edged sword and calling loudly upon the people to wake up and repent of their sins. The Elders who have returned are full of the Holy Ghost and power of God the account which they give  of their missions and the dealings of God with them have been vary  interesting and edifying unto the people   I attended meeting in the 14th ward this evening. I addressed the people was followed by Bishop Hoagland who spoke well he reproved Brother  Ballantyne for the saying the Head or Bishop of the ward was out of the way and while the Head was wrong the body would be wrong. The Bishop said He had done the best he could and He did not feel to take the reprof   Brother Balantyne arose and made his confession before the people which was  except.   W. Woodruff remarked that the people should learn a lesson by that Circumstance that no man in the Church has a right to reprove  any man that is over him in the priesthood if he sees that he is really doing  wrong He has a right to go to the man and pray him to desist but He has  no wright to speak of it to any one ownly to report it to those who are  over him that the evil may be corrected by proper authority   samuel Richards followed and spoke upon the same subject, much to Edification.

I followed him spoke of the various sins which we were liable to commit among others fals promises in deal spoke of the great Blessings which God had  given us from the begining through his servants had revealed great and mighty principles unto us through the prophets who lead us for which we ought to be thankful and live our religion I had a measure of  the spirit of the Lord but not as much as I would have liked I was followed by Bishop Hoagland who had a good deal of the spirit of the Lord. He reproved his councellors and said they were asleep and did him no good if he got any thing out of them He had to go after them they should come to him He said the people were not sufficently  awake he wanted them to wake up and get more of the spirit of God He spoke well    ENDENTRY October 11, 1856 ~ Saturday   11th I spent the day in the office making a commencement upon the History of Joseph  Young and John Young came into the office and herd read what we had  written and corrected what was wrong.

Young at his office with T. Bullock red Church History to him I am about getting inniciated into my office as assistant Historian   while reading the revelation upon the patriarchal marriage and while reading that paragraph relating to sthe sheding of inno- cent Blood President Young remarked that that was a vary nisce point to distinguish between innocent Blood and that which  is not innocent. were we now commanded to go and avenge the Blood of the prophets whare it wood ^reach^ infants from the cradle to the third and forth generation would they know what to do in such  a case they would not. But their is one thing that is a consolation  to me And that is I am satisfied that the Lord will not require it of this people untill they become sanctifyed and are led by the spirit of  God so as not to shed inocent Blood. Again what does the saying mean that sayes all shall be damned that does not keep this Law  unto whom it is revealed does it mean that they shall take more wives than one. I think it includes the whole law with its covenants. I think  that many that come into this world will be damned or disorgan- ized. And I think this is the Death that is refered to that the Broad road leads to, while few will enter throug the straight gate into the  fulness of Eternal life for their are many who will not keep the law of life FIGURE President Young Had Brother Cannon take a Daguerreotype likeness of the Truman O Angel to take with him to England.

You shall be healed up from this deisease and live to enjoy the society of your family and your children shall grow up around you and you shall be a blessing to them let your heart be comforted all shall be well with you And I seal these Blessings  upon you in the name of Jesus Christ.
