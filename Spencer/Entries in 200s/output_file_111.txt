 From thence I made a visit to the Islands.  Twelve years before I carried the Gospel to Fox Island and gathered   with me at the close of my mission to the Islands of the Sea about 60  souls ^out^ of about ^a^ hundred which I baptized while there. I now paid   these Islands a visit agains and after staying there several weeks  I started for New Brunswick Canada    Considerable of the distance I walked.  One day after shouldering my carpet bag and walking 7 miles   I waited 3 hours for the Stage to go to St John's and when it   came along it was loaded down and could not take me. Here  I had 42 miles to reach St John's on foot with a heavy travelling  bag and no conveyance with a vast burning forest to go through    I did not stop to meditate or complain   of my situation but swung my carpet sack over my shoulder and   started on foot in good spirits. Most of the road was through   dense forest rocky and poor soil many parts of the forest was   inhabited by bears and wolves.    After travelling a few ^miles^ I overtook   an Irishman and we walked several miles together when a   man came along in a waggon and carried my bag 5 miles  on before me to Mr McGowings. When I arrived I found   it safe and had a chance to send it on 15 miles farther to   Mr Tilton's. I took dinner with the Irishman we and   left him and I had 15 miles more to walk before I could   stop for the night    I found the whole forest as I came   along laid waste by the late fires which swept fences  dwellings barns mills lumber yard and everything else in   its march leaving but a few dwellings remaining.    Although I began to be very weary   and lame yet I entered the dark forest before me and I   foudn my last 15 miles a dreary road indeed. It seemed   as though I could not get through and when I did arrive 
 At Mr Tilton's I was so lame I could scarcely walk at all and I was under  the necessity of going to bed without my supper. I washed myself in cold  water from head to foot to take the soreness out of my [cords]. I had   walked 35 miles during the day a thing which I had not done before   for 10 years.    After journeying by foot boat and stage we   arrived at the ferry of the Beaubours Island on the 22nd of July where  I left the stage feeling very thankful that my bones were whole and   my life preserved.    I crossed the ferry to the Island walked   one mile through a pleasant grove to the house of Elder Joseph Russel's.  I found him home and had a happy greeting. I   was thankful to shake hands with a Latter-day Saint after   travelling two weeks without seeing any of the Saints.    I was quite unwell next morning which  was Sunday    Elder Joseph Russell was located upon   an Island called Beauburs Island situated at the junction  of the two branches of the Miramichis River 7 miles above  Chatham. The Island is 1 1/2 miles in length and half  a mile wide. Brother Russell had owned the whole   of the Island for eleven years during which time he had  built 23 ships upon it with an average tonage of 650  tons each. His location land and improvements   were at a low rate worth $30,000 besides 3 ships on hand. He was   calculating to sell on the 5th of Nov at some price or other settle   his business and go to the Valley.    The Island was a very beautiful and   plesant situation a good location for ship building in the centre   of the river which abounds with salmon mackeral herring chad  and other fish in their season    Brother Russell was also a Presiding Elder  over a small Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints on    
 the Island. He had a chapel in his own house. I met with him on  this Sunday morning and was much edified with his teachings and   pleased with the order carried out in his meetings and family circle  and in his temporal business. I met with them in the afternoon  and spoke to them from Amos: "Surely the Lord God will do nothing   but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the Prophets." [##Amos 3:7##]    Next evening I visited the burying ground  of Bro Russell's family were laid 4 of his children who had been   taken from the various places where they had been buried and   laid together upon this Island. One of them was a young man who   held the office of Priest in the Church and died strong in the faith.    The burying ground was surrounded by   a cluster of tall Pine trees and a wall of solid mason work 12   feet square and 7 feet high with a cope stone enclosed the   spot where the bodies laid.    I received a letter from brother Gibson  giving news of the Epistle of the Twelve and that the quorum of   the Twelve Apostles of the Church was filled up with Charles C. Rich Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow and Franklin D Richards  who had been thereunto appointed. I was also informed  that Capt. Dan Jones had lost 50 of his company with   the cholera from St Joseph's to the Bluffs.    On the 27th I baptized Archibald  Russell son of Elder Joseph Russell and confirmed him and at the   wish of the father we went to his family burying ground and knelt   before the Lord and I dedicated and consecrated it.    Next day I parted with Sister Russell  and the Saints and with Elder Russell and his son I left the Island   to go to Baideque. I had been greatly blessed while on the   Island and received great kindness from brother and sister Russell   who were full of faith and good works    We ran into the harbour of Bei^e^deque  at sunrise on the 31st and next day hired a man to carry 
 us in a waggon four miles to brother Wm Maxfield's where we arrived quite weary   and took breakfast and then went to a stream near by and caught a dozen  salt water trout.    In the afternoon I met with the Saints at Bro  Pickets. I found 22 members and 1 Priest in the Bideque Branch   rather in a cold state as a body. I preached to them the Gospel and  spoke of the signs of the times; then returned with Elder Russel to Bro   Wm. Maxfield's There was also 4 Saints in Charlottetown.    I found Prince Edward's Island a beautiful   farming country to appearance but with all this the people were   nearly in a state of starvation the crops having failed for two years   past and the merchants were taking all the money out of the country   All the colonies seemed to be in a deplorable state, hundreds of   miles of the country had been burned over this year with fire, sweeping   millions of acres of forest farms fences barns dwellings mills  lumber and lumber yards and in some cases the inhabitants had   to flee into the sea or on the beach to escape the flames. Every   branch of business was dead and the people were leaving for the States every possible way.    On the 1st of Augst I met with the Saints at the house   of Brother Wm Maxfield for the purpose of ^re^organizing the   Bedeque Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  Day Saints. Conference opened by singing and prayer and after   remarks from W Woodruff, President, on the inportance of the   reorganization of the Branch it was moved and carried that Brother   Maxfield be ordained to the office of Elder to preside over it and John Maxfield to the office of Priest and they were ordained under the   hands of Elders Woodruff and Russell.    [redacted]  was by the Conference cut off the   Church for adultery and drunkenness. During this Conference  I spoke 3 hours or more upon the travels of the Pioneers location   of the Saints in the Valley gave counsel to the members 
 blessed fine children and healed two who were sick.    On the 5th of August I took the parting hand   of Brother Russell to return to my family. My mission to the   eastern Churches had been given to me by the Presidency to preside   over the churches in the United States and the British Provinces and   to obtain monies to releive the Church of indebtedness. From   Elder Joseph Russell I obtained for this object $1500 and when   we parted he also gave me personally a new suit of clothes, other   presents paid all my expenses and gave me money to help me  home to the Valley.    I reached Boston on the 10th took   conveyances to Cambridgeport and arrived at my house and   found my family in bed but Mrs Woodruff  arose and gladly   welcomed me and her sister Sarah B. Foss who had accompanied   me from Portland.    In reading the papers after my return   to my family I found statements that in the Hungarian   army there were fifty two thousand Jews fighting against Austria   and Russia; and that a disease had appeared in the Russian   army called the lice itch. It appears like lice or maggots   under the skin in the flesh and those afflicted soon become   a mass of corruption and die in great misery and none are cured.    A revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants  says that among the judgements of the "Last days" the flies   should bite the bodies of men and maggots should come in their  flesh and their flesh fall from their bones and eyes from their   sockets.    On the 1st of September I took the   cars to Fall River and met with the Fall River Branch  and sat until night hearing a difficulty until my head   heart and brains ached. Next day I preached to the   Saints there and had a good time. 
 I rode to New Bedford on the 4th preached at night  and organized a Branch and appointed Elder Joseph Crapo to preside and   Elder Cory his counsellor.    Next day I returned to my family in Cambridgeport   and several nights afterwards there was a fire near our house and   some buildings burned down.    The last European arrival brought the   news that Hungary had fallen beyond redemption and their armies  defeated and surrendered to the Russians and Austrians    On the 15th in company with Mrs  Woodruff our two children and Rhoda and Phebe Foss myself and   Elder Leonard Hardy took train to Bradford.    The 18th was a day set apart by the   Bradford Branch of the Church to have their annual Plum   Island ride and I and my family  had been invited to join   them.    It was a pleasant day and we assembled   in the morning at 1/2 8 o'clock at Mr Burbank's where we   found our procession consisting of 18 carriages containing   78 persons.    Mr Burbank being the eldest led the   van and was followed by Wilford Woodruff. On the way   we were overtaken by 25 persons drawn in the "Bonnyboat"   by 6 cream colored horses who headed our company as   we went to Newberryport where we stayed 15 miles from   Mr Burbanks.    Reaching the Island we went into a   romantic valley surrounded by hills of sand and plum bushes   A spot of half an acre in the centre of the valley was well   covered with nice grass. Around this spot we formed our   carell of carriages; upon the green grass the females   spread their table cloths and loaded them with every dainty 
 that heart could wish. The ground having previously been dedicated by   the Saints Elder Woodruff was seated at the head of the table and   after he had asked a blessing upon the food and bounties of the   earth spread before us we feasted with glad hearts and cheerful   countenances walked to the sea shore spent an hour and returned   home.    About this time the French Minister at   Washington was dismissed and offered his passports and invited   to return home. High words had also passed between the   British and American Minister.    On Sunday the 30th I met with   the Saints inCambridgeport. Dr John M. Bernhisal met   with us and gave a rehersal of affairs in the Valley which was   interesting. He had come as a representative from the   Valley to Washington hearing our petition to Congress for   a Territorial Government.    Copy of a Letter  Received From the First Presidency    Great Salt Lake City    July 25, 1849.    Dear Brother Woodruff,    As our mail is now making up for the   States we cannot let so favourable an opportunity of communicating   with you pass unimproved.    Our prospects for grain are tolerably good and   if we are not flooded with immigration intending for the mines   but compelled to tarry here we should have plenty for the   ensuing year. Out wheat harvest is now at its height and   is coming off for better than appearance seemed to warrant   The spirit of industry which has ever characterized the Saints 
 of the Most High God has been brought to bear with wonderful effect upon   the burning and arid desert.    The next time that you encounter the hardships   privations and toil of a journey over the plains and mountains you   will meet with a very different reception from what attended your  first arrival here. Friends will greet your arrival and the products  of the earth will administer to your comfort.    Our city and Valley is fast improving   roads are being made and bridges mills and houses building on every   side with astonishing rapidity considering our circumstances and   the disadvantages under which we labour but the blessings   of health peace and union have attended us. Hence our prosperity.    We have a settlement in the Utah Valley   and have extended North above the Weber river. We have   irrigated our land which is considerable labour but ^it^ will dimith  diminish as we improve in fixtures and experience. One   thing is certain. All the necessary products of the earth   for the sustinance of man can be raised. You have   probably learned before this that we are endeavoring to   obtain a legal government from the United States.   Dr Bernhisel is East upon this business and brother A W  Babbitt will leave to morrow as our delegate to Washington.    Our object is to gain admission as  a Sovereign State into the Union. Whenever you can use   your influence to further this object do so. Also gather up   and come on with all you can bring another season. We shall   be quite happy to see you as will all your friends.    We had yesterday a celebration of the   anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneers in this Valley. It was a day   long to be remembered. Your father enjoyed it well being one of the 24   aged fathers selected as part of the escort. For full details of these   proceedings see the Frontier Guardian. Wishing for the peace of heaven to rest upon you 
 Your brethren in the Gospel of Christ    Brigham Young   Heber C. Kimball  Willard Richards    This letter I copied into my daily Journal to which afterwards   I obtained the authographs of the First Presidency.    Dr Bernhisel spent the afternoon of the   5th of October with me and he related some of    The Last Words of Joseph the Prophet.    Brother Bernhisel had lived in the family of President Joseph Smith   for years and was with him in prison on the morning of the day   of his martyrdom. He informed me that Brother Joseph   addressed his remarks to him alone when he said "I am going   as a Lamb to the slaughter yet I shall die with a conscience   void of offence towards God and man. I feel as calm as   a Summer's morning" and the expression of his countenance  showed that he was so. He added "It will yet be said   of me that he was murdered in cold blood"   Elders Little and Hardy called upon me   and spent the evening.    The papers at this time were stirred   up and devoted considerable attention to the affairs of the   Latter-day Saints their organizing a State government and the  election of Brigham Young as Governor.    On the 15th of October I and my family   arrived at Scarborough on a visit to my wife's father and our   friends in Maine and on the 20th we returned home again.    A week later I went on board the David   Porter and sailed to Dennis on Cape Cod and next day rode   to West Harwich and held a meeting with the Saints. Most   of the brethren were out on a fishing voyage and when they 
 returned the following day they gave me a barrel of fat mackerel to take   home with me.    While here I administered by the laying on of   hands to an aged sister of 84 years old and she immediately arose from   her bed and commenced washing some small articles.    On the 3rd of November I returned home   and on Sunday held a meeting at my house.    I received a pamplet some days later entitled   Consititution of the State of Deseret with the Journal of the Convention.    I left home on the 17th took cars at   Boston and arrived at Wiliamanti that night and next day met with the Saints in the house of brother Dan Atwood the father of Millen Attwood who lived with President Young. He had three sons in the   Church and talked of going to the Valley in the Spring. This   branch of the Church was called the Mansfield Branch and contained   thirty five members.    Three days afterwards I was at New York   and on the 23rd I arrived at Philedelphia where I found Dr John   Bernhisel and we spent the night together.    Next day we called at the Office of Col  Kane but was not in and on the Sunday morning I preached  to the Church at Philedelphia and in the afternoon Dr Bernhisel  gave an account of the history of the Valley. In the evening I   preached to a full house and the Spirit of God was with us.    On the 28th I took cars for Newark. In   the cars where I was many noted members of Congress were on   their way to Washington. It was said that Hon Henry Clay  Gen Cass Gov. Seward Hon Mr Wilmot Truman Smith Mr   Wheeler and others were there.    I took cars to Philedelphia Dec 14  where I arrived on the same day and called upon Col Kane  and saw a sleigh robe presented to him by Dr Bernhisel as   a present from President Young. It contained 7 wolves skins   10 fox skins got up with great taste. 
 The Celebrated J^G^erard College    This college is one of the finest buildings  I ever saw.  I visited it on the 3rd of December. The general   design of the building is that of Greek Temple having eight  columns on each end and eleven on each side (counting the   corner columns both ways) making in all thirty four columns.    The columns are 6 feet in diameter  out 55 feet in height ^on the face of the abacus.^ and the capitals 8 feet 6 inches high 9 feet   4 inches wide Each shaft is   channelled in 24 semicircular flutes.    The net amount of marble in each   column including the base and capital is 1346 cubic feet   103 tons and the cost $12,9^9^94. The total cost of the 34  columns $51,976. Th    The exterior of the cella or body of the   building measure 111 feet wide 169 feet long and 59 feet 8 inches  high. The whole of the exterior of the building is composed  of marble of a very superior quality.    Every block of marble in the building   is set on peices of milled lead. The roof is composed of   marble tiles 4 1/2 feet long 4 feet wide 2 3/4 inches thick. Each   tile is 776 lbs and each saddle 213 lbs. The whole number  of the tiles in the roof being 2046 and of saddles 2061:  the aggregate weight of the tiles and saddles is 906 tons  Marble chimney tops and cast-iron sky lights also weigh   20 tons and the lead and masonary of the gutters 43 1/2  tons making the entire weight of the roof 969 1/2 tons    The building is three stories in heighth  The first and second stories are 25 feet from flour to  flour and the third 30 feet in the clear. Each story   is divided as directed by the will into 4 rooms 50 feet 
 square in the clear. The outside walls are four feet in thickness the   inside 3 feet. Each arch including its abutments contains 117,000 brick   which together with the marble floor on top makes the weight suspended   over each room about 350 tons. The stairways are situated in the   forecorners of the building the spaces allotted to them being each   22 feet ^6 inches wide 26 feet 6 inches long^ tons. They are all composed of white marble and are 5   feet 3 inches in width with two leaandings or quarter pieces ^paces^ in each   story.  The plan on which they are constructed is that of   geometrical stairs having one end of each step secured in the wall   and one edge resting on the step below. All the stair ways   as well as the landing in the upper stairs are finished with rich   bold rods ^balstrades balustrades^ of cast iron and maogany rails sprining from many ^massive^  marble newels. The cost of these stair ways including   the balustrades was $18,500.    The following are the materials used in   the construction of the main building = weighing = tons   177,168 cubic feet of marble " [weighing] 13534 [tons]  25139 flooring tiles "[weighing]" 409 [tons]  12,134,980 Brick "[weighing] 27,087 [tons]  12, 945495 perches of building stone "[weighing] 19635 [tons]  21,366 cubic feet of granite "[weighing] 1,717 [tons]  Wrought Iron for bands cramps [&c] "[weighing] 134 [tons]  Cast Iron in celling of Portico "[weighing] 142 1/2 [tons]   Do in Water Pipes "[weighing] 18 1/2 [tons]  Do in Skylights and inner rims "[weighing] 18 [tons]  Milled led for gutters and setting marble & led for cramping "[weighing] 48 1/2 [tons]  53,720 bushels of lime "[weighing] 1431 [tons]  50,2274 bushels of river sand "[weighing] 3292 [tons]  133,646 bushels of Pit Sand "[weighing] 3759 [tons]  4200 bushels of Hydraulic cement "[weighing] 250 [tons]  Locks fastenings glass lumber in doors and windows &c "[weighing] 116 [tons]  Making the aggregate weight of the building 67^76^,594 [tons]  Cost of the whole establishment $1,933,821.78 
 Extract of Stephen Gerard's Will    "Secondly; I enjoin and require  that no ecc[lesiastic] missionary   or minister of any sect whatsoever shall ever hold or exercise   any station or duty whatever in the said college nor shall any   such person ever be admitted for any purpose or as a visitor   within the premises appropriated to the purposes of the said   college.    Copy of My Ticket    Strangers Ticket: Admit Mr Woodruff to visit the main   building of the Gerard College    Jas. J. Boswell Director Nov 28, 1849.    Speech  delivered by    Mr Copway or Koh-Ge-Ga-Gah-bow Chief of the Ojewa ^Ojebwa^ nation   Before a large audience at New York  On the eve of Dec. 15, 1849.    Ladies and Gentlemen—American Citizens:    Of necessity my address this evening must be   short; yet I will touch upon a few prominant items which I   consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested   There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep   interest in the history of every nation under heaven. Therefore the   history of the Indians or their present condition has also a   deep interest — an interest of greater importance than at first   presents itself to the mind of the American people. Although   it may appear to them as covered with a cloud or buried   deep from their view yet it non the less exists    Then listen to me: I have deeply 
 studied the situtaiton and interest of of my brethren the Red Men for years and I   have resolved to call ^aloud^ upon the white man of this nation to give ear to my   petitions.    If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst   making a display of oratory like the white man it is not because he   has not talent but because he has not the chance to exercise it.    1st: My object in visiting the United States is   to present a petition to this government that they may assist me in   concentrating the Indians together that they may live and not die. I   want Congress to grant them a portion of Territory that they can   call their own and be concentrated upon it that they may not be   driven from it any more. They once were the owners and occupiers   of the whole soil of all North America. The white man came  and removed the Indians and continually have driven them until   they can see no hope but the grave before them.    I now ask in their behalf a territory to   settle them upon that they may have a permanent home forever   and come under the United States Government and become part   and parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied   the history^interest^ of all both the white and the red man.    1st: give them a Territory that they can   call their own where their children can point to the graves of the   fathers and say, We can now live in peace and be driven   no more; we can visit the graces of our fathers with none to   drive us from them; and they will be inspired to engage in every   laudable untertaking that now marks the course of the white   man.    2nd You can then establish schools among   them that will be of benefit to them. They would obtain   knowledge and make a good use of it. The Gospel could   then be introduced among them and they would be far more   ready to receive it when they find the white man is consistant   and willing to do them good; but when the white man 
 offers the Gospel to the Indians one year and the next comes and drives   him from his home and the graces of his fathers he has no faith or   confidence in either the white man or his Gospel.    3rd you can then introduce agriculture amongst   them and they will receive it for they would then see of necessity they   must cultivate the land or dies. They could not depend upon game   for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating   the soil make improvements and take delight in them the   same as the white man.    4th They would then be in a position   where they would be delivered from the ill consequences of   constant removing which has continually followed them for   many years. The ill consequences of removing have   been multiplied and very great. This has been on main   reason why schools have been unproductive of good among   them. This is also the reason why missionaries have   done no more more good among them.    The Indians are fast decreasing and   passing away. That is the cause of all this. There are   various causes. There constant removing is one cause  Disease which has been introduced among them by the white   man in the capacity of traders missionaries and emigrants also   also the introduction of alcohol have had a tendency to waste   them away; also wars among themselves and wars with   the white man all of which have continually wasted away   the Indian tribes.    I will here remark that in the   origin of the wars with the whites the conducting of those   wars and in the treaties of peace made and broken the Indians  have been badly treated and abused by the whites    For instance some ruffian or tracker   visits the Indians introduces wild fire or alcohol among   them and will get the Indian drunk and perhaps drunk 
 himself and will cheat them in any way he can and perhaps kill some   of them and in his career he gets killed himself. Then the cry goes forth   that the savage Indians are killing and murdering the inhabitants of   the country. It is proclaimed in all the public journals of the   Union. Yes one side of the story is proclaimed as with peals   of thunder throughout the earth; but no voice is raised in behalf   of the poor Indian. Their story is not told. The world hear   it not; they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the   story of the white man is known and proclaimed to the world the   armies of war must be prepared and soldiers sent forth to drive   and kill the Indians and burn their homes and in this way the most   desolating and expensive wars have been carried on for many   years until we feel it is time for the white man to take a  different course with the Indians,    As an example of the bad effects of   continually removing the Indians I would refer you to the Cherokee   nation. That people were fast improving following rapidly   in the footsteps of the white man had extensive farms and   good dwellings and continued rapidly advancing in improvements   until they were suddenly brought to a stand in their course by   being cruelly called upon by the State of Georgia to give up their   lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the   wilderness. And thus it was that thir mighty nation instead   of receiving that support ^encouragement^ and comfort from the nation that it ought   to receive was forced by the cruel hand of oppression to bow   ^out see copy^ their heads in sorrow ^and despair^ until they shall be called to pass through   the same ordeal again to remove and remove until they are   anihilated from off the face of the earth.    Oh Ye white man what encouragement   do you give the Indian to plant to build to learn to cultivate   the earth or receive a religion that professes love mercy   kindness and truth while those who profess to enjoy   it deals out such deeds of oppression and cruelty upon the 
 heads of the red man^men^ that it drives them to madness and despair.    Let the American nation stay their hands   from this time forth in their oppression and driving of the Indians lest   they drive them beyond a point which the Indian will endure and   return a blow upon the head of the white man which will fill many   a habitation with death.    Once give the Indians a Territory—a   home where they can have a full assurance that their ears or those   of their children will no more be saluted with a call to remove from   their lands then if if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement   then cast them off as not worthy of your support or attention but   until then you are not justified your garments are not clear.    The spirit of the age and times   demands that Congress should take immediate action upon this   matter. 1st: The Indians cannot retain their lands.  Emigration of the white men are already surrounding  them and in their midst and the richness and fertility   of the Indians lands are a temptation to the white   man and invite him to settle thereon.    2nd the Indians have too much   land more than what they need to till and cultivate   for their support.    Let there be a Territory set off   on the North West of Iowa North of Council Bluffs  on the Missouri on which there is no no white   settlement and let the Indians East of the Rocky  Mountains and in the United States be gathered   up in it. Then let other Territories in the West be appropriated   and let all the Indians on the North American Continent be   collected together and learn us to cultivate the earth. They will   soon associate themselves together and cease their wars among   themselves also with the white men. If there is not something   of this kind done the vast emigration through all the Indian 
 lands will soon destroy the game and then want and starvation will ensue and   this will bring on war between the white and red men.    If my proposition is accepted by the American   Government and they will carry it out it will be of vast benifit both   to the Indians and the people of the United States.    1st the benefit to the Indians will be: It will give   them a permanent home where schools can be established among them   and their children taught the English language. Farms can also be opened   among them and when they see they have a permanent home   for themselves and their children and they have no game to   depend upon for food they will immediately immediately go to   work and cultivate the earth like ^the^ white man. The Gospel   can then be introduced among them to a good effect and they will   receive it with thankfulness when they can be made to believe   that the hand that deals out the Gospel to them is not laying a   plan to take the advantage of them and preparing a way   to drive them from their home and country. It will not only   unite their intrest and attachment towards each other but   their regard and interest with that of the United States.    The benefit to the Government is less   expenses:    1st buying their lands and paying them yearly   annuities which is costing the government immense sums of   money.    2nd: The continual transporting of Indians   from place to place. There has laready been 96,000 Indians  removed by the Government.    3rd: The keeping of many Indian Agents   at great expence to Government could then be dispensed with.    4th: Fortifications have now to be   errected on the borders of all Indian tribes with the intention   of keeping the Indians in Subjection. These would not be   needed if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for 
 by having this trail clear and no encroachments of the white man upon   their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.    I am going to Washington soom to lay my petition   before the Congress of the United States and urge them to grant my   prayer for the benefit of both the white and red man.    I want your aid: I want you to sign   my petition that the voice of thousands may be heard in behalf   of this petition. I want the names of legislators governors   and American Citizens in general that my prayer may be   heard and answered.    Give the North American Indians   a home a place where the soles of their feet can rest in peace   in a situation where you can teach them literature agriculture   and commerce and give them the chance the white man has   and I prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will   ere long be found among them their philosophers their   Franklins and Washingtons who would do honour to   any civilized or Christian nation on the globe. But   let this nation turn a deef ear to my petitions and the   petitions of the Indians—continue to oppress them and   drive them to desperation and the hour is near when the Camp  fire will be seen upon many a hill. The war hoop will  re-echo from one end of the Rocky Mountains to the other. The   Indian will then sell his life as dear as possible and deal   out death whereever an opportunity offers. When this   blow is struck it will be terrible to all. May God   forbid that such a blow should fall at all that the   scenes of bloody Bloody Brook should ever ^any^ more be   enacted.    American citizens it is to ward   off this blow that I now stand before you—that I   now call upon this nation hearing a petition unto them 
 Among other remarks he said "I applied  according to the wish of President Young for a Territorial   Government. I had my last sad and painful interview   with President Polk. I found he did not feel to favour   your people and had his men of his own stamp picked   out to serve as Governor and other officers who would   have oppressed you in any way to fill their own pockets  He would not appoint men from among yourselves   and I saw it absolutely necessary that you should   have officers of your own people to govern you or   you were better without any government. I had   to use my own discretion and I withdrew the petition.    Synopsis of 1849    During this year I travelled through eleven of   the United States and New Brunswick Miramichi and   Prince Edward's Island making a distance of 5040 miles.    I held 92 Public Meetings.    I Baptised 11 persons.  Confirmed 21.  I ordained my father in law Esra Carter. 
 1850    I returned home from my travels among   the Churches around Boston on the 7th of Jan and received   some letters among which was an Epistle from the First   Presidency from which I extract the following items:    "They have universal health [in the Valley]  good crops plenty to eat no sickness or death of late are   prospering on every hand are laying off three new cities   one at Brownville one at Utah Valley and one at Sandpitch  Valley 200 miles South of Salt Lake Valley ^and^ from 50 to   100 families had gone too ^where to^ form a settlement at Sanpitch  under the Presidency of Father Morley. They had organized   the Nauvoo Legion and it would have been a source of joy  to the Saints throughout the Earth could they have witnessed  its movements on the day of its great Parade and to have   seen the men ground their arms not by command but   simply by request repair to the Temple Block and with pick   and spade open the foundation for a place of worship and   erect the pilasters beams and roof so that we have now   a commodious edifice 100 by 60 feet with brick walls  where we assemble with the Saints from Sab^b^ath to Sabbath   and almost every evening in the week to teach counsel 
 and devise ways and means for the prosperity of the Kingdom of God   and we feel thankful that we have a better house or bowery for  public worship the coming winter than we have heretofore had   in any Winter in this dispensation. Also the walls of the Council   House are nearly completed (out) The foundation is laid and  the brick prepared for an extensive storehouse and Granary   and no exertions are wanting on our part to push forward   the public works as fast as tithing and means are put into   our hand."    The Presidency spoke of their great Celebration   on the 24th ^of July as long to be remembered^; the establishment of the Perpetual Emigration   Fund and their resolution to send the Gospel to all the world   as soon as possible. All of the Twleve Apostles who   were in the Valley with many others had their missions   assigned to them to the nations. Elder John Taylor  accompanied by Curtis C. Bolton and John Pack were for   France; Elder Lorenzo Snow to Italy and Joseph Toranto  with him. Erastus Snow to Denmark and Peter Hanson  with him; Franklin D. Richards was for England  accompanied by John S. Higby George B. Wallace, Job  Smith H.W. Church, Joseph W. Johnson Jospeph W.   Young and Jacob Gates. Elder Parley Pratt was appointed   for a Western mission to the Islands in the Spring  Elder John Forsgreen was to go on a mission to Sweeden.    The Epistle spoke of Elder Orson Pratt  doing a great work in England and said    "Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeport  and has been comforting and instructing the Saints  in Canada and the Eastern States the past year   If Elder Woodruff will gather up all the Saints in   his vicinity and come with them to this place he   will be doing a great work and will be opening a   way for a visit to those nations who have both 
 eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israel come tell us of the   things of God for we have heard that God is with you."    The Presidency called loudly upon me to   gather up all the Saints in the Eastern Country and bring them   to Zion to establish woolen and cotton factories &c.    The following is an item of the minutes   of the Conference.    On motion President Brigham Young was   sustained as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints by unanimous vote and Heber C. Kimball as   First and Willard Richards as Second Counsellor; John Smith  as Patriarch of the whole Church and Willard Richards Historian  Orson Hyde President of the Quorum of the Twelve Parley P. Pratt  Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff John Taylor George A. Smith  Amasa Lyman  Ezra T. Benson Charles C. Rich Lorenzo  Snow Erastus Snow and Franklin D. Richards as members   of that quorum.    On Sunday the 24th of Feb. we   had with us at our meetings at Boston Elders Wallace   Haywood and Wolley from Zion. We had a glorious time   I addressed the Saints and was followed by Elder Haywood Wolley   and Wallace who spoke much to our edification. I felt the   Spirit of God like fire shut up in my bones as I spoke   upon the things of the Kingdom of God.    I was 43 years of age on the 1st of March   of the year 1850.    The day after I took cars for Portland and   next day with my brothers in law Ezra and Ilus Carter I went   in a sleigh to Scarboro to see Father Carter whom we found   lonely and on the evening of the 4th I returned home again.    On the 6th myself Mrs Woodruff  her   brother Ilus and his wife went into Boston and had and interview  with brothers Haywood and Wolley and consulted with them 
 upon the purchase of a bill of goods and then assisted in purchasing a   bill of goods mostly dry good to the amount of 15.00 dolars from the   firm of Newton Eaton &co. I paid brother Wolley 245 dollars for   waggons and sundries.    Next day we purchased another bill of goods  to the amount of 15.00 dollars and another bill of crockery of 200 dollars  I received 100 dollars from M. C. Pevey and gave it to M. Cannon  to buy oxen for said Pevey.    The day following we continued our purchases   for my brother in law Ilas Carter until dark.    On the 11th I gave M Cannon 555 dollars  to purchase cattle for the emigration near the outfilling point. I   took 3000 lbs of stationary and books from the Eastern Depot to   long warf and put on board of the ship Beatrice also 900 lbs   of baggage for S. B. Foss.    Next day I continued with my brother-in-law  Ilus and made a bill of hardware also a bill of 600 dollars   worth of shoes.    Elder Alexander Badlam arrived home today   from the gold diggings of California. He had been gone one   year and brought two thousand dollars worth of gold dust and   to me he brought as a present from several brethren in the mines  9 1/2 ounces of gold dust; and this began to fulfill the portion   of my Patriarchal blessing which said I should have access to   the treasures hid in the sand to assist me in my necessities   and in the gathering of many orphan children to Zion.    Elder Badlam put into my hands  200 dollars and sent from the gold mines to help Thomas Knowles  to Zion and I wrote informing him that he might get ready   to go with us. Brother Badlam besides the gold he   brought for himself had brought considerable to cheer the heartts   of several others sent to them from the mines to help them  emigrate to the Valley. 
 On the 23 of March Professor Orson Pratt arrived   from Liverpool where he had been  presiding over the British Mission   and we sat up together late conversing upon the business of the Kingdom.    Next day we went into the city of Boston   together and met Erastus Snow and George B. Wallace and in the   afternoon we met with the Saints and Erastus Snow gave an   account of the dealings of the Lord with the brethren in the Valley   and concerning the cricket war which had sorely tried the people   Elder Orson Pratt followed and spoke much to our edification. He   expected to increase the Millennial Star from five thousand to   twenty thousand.    Early next morning Elder Orson Pratt   parted with me to go to New York previous to his return   to England.    I attended the trial of Professor Webster for   the murder of Dr Parkman which closed on the 30 with a verdic  of murder in the 1st degree and sentence  to be hung.    On the 3rd of April Elder Erastus Snow  took his departure from Boston on board the Steamer bound  for Europe while we were very busy packing up and getting   ready to start for the Valley.    I held my last meeting with the Saints   in Cambridgeport on Sunday the 7th of April and on the 9th   I left Boston with my family other relatives and 100 Saints and   arrived in New York where we were joined next morning by   100 more Saints and at 5 o'clock P.M. we left with 209   in our company and arrived in Philadelphia in the morning   Our baggage and freight amounted to 42 thousand pounds weight.    On the 18th we arrivied at Pittsburgh   and I was visited by several Steamboat captains who   wanted to take our company to St Louis and finally   I made a contract with Captain Devinney of the De Wit  Clinton to take our company to St Louis on the following 
 terms:    Cabin passingers $8; steerage $2 fright 20 cts per   100 pounds and he agreed to wait for our other boats to come  up.  Most of us spent the night on board the section boat.    I received a letter stating that the hind  boat had met with an accident and knocked a hole in her   which had detained them two days to repair.    Next day I received another letter from   the hind boat requesting us to tarry until they came   up. The second boat containing Elder Leonard Hardy  and company arrived this morning and we unloaded both  our boats weighed the baggage and put it on board the   De Wit Clinton and assigned the births to the company.    Three days later our last boat   arrived and they with their baggage were got on board  making 212 souls of the Saints and 200 other passengers.    Next day we started and I never   found a Captain of a boat who took more pains to   make us comfortable than Captain Devinney.    We arrived at St Louis Missouri  and I was soon visited by Elders Heywood and Felt.    I made a contract with Captain  Baker to take up our company on the Sacramento  to Council Bluffs on the following terms. Cabin $13  deck $4 freight 50 cts per 100 lbs.    The Sacramento came alongside   the Clinton and took our freight on board which occupied   most of the day.    I felt thankful to God that we had   arrived at St Louis in safety and no lives lost and   up to this time we had no deaths among us but this   night Sister Bird was taken sick with cholera and the   next day^morning^ she died. 
 We called upon the city authorities to bury her  and the Sexton soon came with a coffin and we paid the last respects  to the remains of our sister.    After a hard days work to get our company   and boat ready we started at dark but brothers Leonard Hardy   and Russel were left on shore they however afterwards came   down and the Captain took them in.    On the 6th we stoped about 2 hours at   Bloomfield and brother  Branch went to the grave yard and   buried his child that had died of the worm fever  News met us on our way up the river  that many were coming back from the Plains and selling   out their teams and going home and so the price of oxen   was falling. They had made a rush to the mines   before any grass had grown to sustain their oxen.    We started for St Joseph's on the   12th of May and early on the morning of the 14th word   was given for the passengers to walk on shore to lighten  the boat and some of our company with mules left for  the Bluffs and when we got ready they could not be found  It was supposed they had fainted by the way and our   Captain and others rode miles in search of them but came  back without finding them and then we started up the   river with our boat and came upon them about 5 miles  a head.    We arrived at Fort Kearney on the   morning of the 15th and left all the passengers and freight  not bound for the Bluffs and went on to Deseret Depot   where we arrived about dark. Here I found my brother  in law Ilus Brother Badlam and many others. I   spent most of the night on my feet taking charge  of our baggage.    Next day I reached Kanesville 
 had a little time with Elder Hyde and then returned to my company   which I had left to visit in Kanesville.    On the 18th I again rode to Kanesville  with Elder Badlam and Leonard Hardy spent a little time with   him and then went to Elder Hyde's where I found him and Orson   Pratt.    I spent a long evening in conversation with   these brethren of the Twelve. Elder Hyde wished me to lay   before the Presidency in the Valley the affairs of the Church   in Pottawatamie County Iowa. He wished me to say   to them that all the men of capital were leaving for the   Valley; men from the East and England and all who  were able to go were making their fit out and talking of   starting.    There was another class he said who were   able to get a fit out in part even able to get waggons and   they were helped on by Bishop Hunter so that the poorest  part of the community alone remained.    He did not think Kanesville and the   surrounding country should be broken up which would be the   case if it continued thus and wished me to lay the subject  before the Presidency with many more details that he gave  me of his views.    Elder Orson Pratt wished me to say to   the Presidnecy that there were many Elders in England of   power faith and talent who had to labour hard to get bread  for their familises and when Elders were sent to them from   America who could not edify them they felt it a tax upon   them and that their own Elders were more efficient in the   ministry than some of those sent unto them.    On the next day according to appointment  I met in Conference with Orson Hyde Orson Pratt and the   High Council near the Stand in the Grove one hour 
 before the General meeting.  Elder Hyde addressed the Conference   in Substance as follows:    There was business left unfisnished at   the Conference which must be closed today. As some of   the officers were going to the Valley others must be appointed  Bishop Johson wsa going and another Bishop must be   appointed in his place also men to visit the various  Branches who would attend the Council and carry the   Spirit of the Council to the people and bring back their   spirit to them. Joseph Young and Benjamin   Clapp who were appointed last year were not with them   at all either in body or, spirit and whenever they did   attend a Council Joseph Young could not stay until   he went away. We will let that pass over we will   let them go.    Elder Hyde also remarked that it was   necessary to make arrangements to receive the poor  that had of late arrived among us. I have given   Counsel through the Guardian for the poor not to   come here and some have contrary to this counsel  through misguided zeal counselling them to come and   such must hear the consequences of it.    It was afterwards voted that   a Bishop be appointed to take the place of Bishop Johnson  and that Elder Stoddard be appointed to travel among  the Churches and call such men to his aid as he needed. Three men were appointed as committe  to locate the poor.    We then repaired to the Stand  before the congregation and each item of business  was presented to the people and Elder Hyde made  many remarks upon each item as it came along  and gave counsel to the people. 
 In the afternoon Elder Orson Pratt preached and related the   progress of the work in England of the thousands who were coming into   the Church the publications from the Millennial Star office and the   opposition manifesting. He was followed by Elder Woodruff.    The speaker said he had baptized while on this   mission about 200 souls. As to the poor coming to Hanesville  he had received counsel from the First Presidency to streach out his   arms and gather all he possible could to Zion and when the   Lord told him to do anything or he received counsel through the   proper source he went at it with all his might. He  had laboured hard to gather out the people according to the   instruction given him. One company started from Philadelphia  under Elder Gibson and he himself had started from Boston   on the 9th instant with a company of 209 which was   increased at St Louis to 225. There are^were^ a few  poor who had come with him who were not able to go   through and if in his zeal to carry out the instruction   of the Presidency he had been instrumental in causing more  of the poor to come to Kanseville than ought to have come  it was an error of the head not of the heart.    In outfitting the brethren paid from $45 to $80 per yoke for oxen.    On the 1st of June my brother-in-law  Illus Carter returned from St Joseph's and had purchased 19   yoke of oxen and two horses for his merchandise train   for Salt Lake City.    After the usual preparation and  labour of outfitting we commenced to cross the Mo. River  on the 15th of June and the next day I received instructions  from Elder Hyde to organize our company whether they   were few or many. I could not organize it in full   until I had crossed the river.    We camped on Rattlesnake Hill 
 on the 17th but the woods bushes and rattlesnakes made it bad  for herding; but Two days later we left and journeyed onward five  miles where we laid several days.    On the 21st I called the camp together  and organized them as follows:    Robert Petty was appointed captain of the Hundred    Leonard W. Hardy captain of the 1st Fifty    Edson Whipple Captain of the Second Fifty    Joseph Hall Captain of the First Ten    James Currier Captain of the Second Ten    Miner Atwood Captain of the 3rd Ten  Brother Gardner Captain of the 4th Ten  — Captain of the 5th Ten  — Captain of the 6th Ten    Remarks were made by Wilford Woodruff concserning the   order of the camp and regulations for our journey strongly   opposing drinking swearing gambling whipping oxen &c.    Ilus F. Carter had ten waggons of   merchandise and was appointed Captain over them but   in consequence of ^illness and^ the lateness of the season he concluded to   return home so we made out the report of our organization   and sent it by him to Elder Hyde.    My brother in law Ilus F Carter   left in my possession his train of merchandise which   with my own gave me 12 waggons 27 yoke of oxen 30  cows teamsters &c under my personal care besides   the whole company to care for generally and this afforded  plenty of labour and anxiety. Several of the teamsters  were also not bretheren and they were more difficult to   manage and during the journey they manifested much of   the Spirit of the devil and tried to make disturbance  in the Camp. They were gold diggers. Their object was 
 to take advantage of ^our^ situation and compel us to pay higher wages  I told them they might leave and discharged their ringleader  and the rest became more humble; but finally we had to cast them out.    On the 28th th Bro. Samuel Smith   died of cholera. He was aged 43 and two days later Capt  Joseph Hall having drank of slough water freely died after   12 hours sickness. We all felt his loss for he was very   useful to the camp.    July 1st we dug his grave but 4 men of   his company had made a covenant that should any of their  ten die on the road they would not bury them the same   day and so they remained with the body and the camp  continued and met a company of brethren from the Valley   with the mail. Brother ^Robert L^ Campbell had charge of it. We   parted from them next day.    On the 3rd Matilda Hardy died  and on the 5th Lucy Johnson and two days later Mrs  Snow and some days later Emily Huntington died. There  were deaths more or less in all the Camps this season   and we passed their newly made graves. ^On the 10th in the Platte  I baptized 14 persons & confirmed them^    While our teams were crossing a a Slough  on the 15th th a terrible thunderstorm burst the lightning   struck into our midst frightened many persons and cattle  killed 3 oxen and one man ^Brother Ridge from^ dead. He was brother Ridge  from Lane End Staffordshire. He and his team were   killed.    Stampede    On the 30th of July the 1st division of our camp  was called to pass through one of those scenes so much   dreaded by all emigrant companies—namely, a stampede.    ^of all^ All the oxen with the families  and waggons of the first division with the exception 
 of the ten baggage waggons which were in the rear s.    No person who has not witnessed one of these   terrific scenes can form any correct idea of them and it is almost  impossible to give an adequate description of it.    Behold 30 or 40 ox teams with from   2 to 5 yoke of cattle in each team attached to a family waggon   of goods women and children all in an instant like the twinkling   of an eye become frantic all dart off with lightning speed   running their own way bellowing rolling and tumbling over   each others waggons upsetting smashing their wheels axes and   tongues ^spilling^ upsetting the goods women and children for the next   teams to trample under feet as they roar and charge along   with their yokes bows and chains flying in every direction.   Such is a Stampede and the scene is not easily immagined  nor described.    Our Stamped commenced in the   following manner:    While my son Wilford was getting on   to his horse William Murphy ^struck the horse horse with a whip and^ started ^his^ his horse into a   run and Wilford's horse ^was^ flung him over his head onto   the ground the saddle ^was turned^ under his ^the horses^ belley and he ran away   and as he approached one of the waggons Mr Cannon's   team became frantic and started off with great spead   In a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the example and  the whole encampment apparantly was rushing into the   jaws of Death.    I was by my carriage when this   commenced. In my carriage which was drawn by a   fine black steed were Rhoda Foss and Susan Woodruff   and we were at the head of the company.    I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the   midst of the scene when she was in danger of her life every   instant with many other women and children. I told 
 Rhoda to let my horse run into the Bluffs and to do the best she could  and then I gave him a cut to start him into a run and left them   to their chance and the care of Providence and rushed into the   midst of the Stampede to try to save the life of my wife and  as  many others as possible but I had hard work to save my   own life.    Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening  and fled out of the midst of the scene. Brother Petty's two   waggons were turned over. My family waggon with 4   yoke of oxen ran over one of his and a waggon ran over   one of his children ^+(out)^ Prescott Hardy was knocked down   by his own team and badly wounded in the thigh and arm   Wherever I saw women or children in danger I did what  I could to rescue them but only little can be done at such  times except for each to dodge the best he can and save   his or her life if possible.    When I found I could do no more for   the encampment in general I ran forward to see what   state my carriage, family−waggon and family were  in. I found my noble horse still running   but on three legs. Rhoda was knocked out of the  carriage and Susan was lying flat upon the bottom   of the carriage with her feet hanging out between the   wheels and she was screaming aloud. I hollowed   for her to hold on until I came and she did so until  I caught the horse by the bit and stoped him and  rescued my daughter.    One of the ox teams had run on to   the horse and carriage bent one of the axes smashed  one of the horse's legs to pieces and knocked my   wife's sister ^niece^ Rhoda out of the carriage.    As soon as I got the horse out  of the carriage I went through the encampment to see who 
 was killed or maimed; but was astonished to find that no one was  killed and only one badly wounded and but little damage done  either to the oxen or waggons. It was a miracle that so  many escaped. I had to shoot my horse however to put  him out of his misery. This was very painful to me  but I was thankful that my wife children and the company  were preserved so providentially.    On the 2nd of August we lost 20  head of cattle and I started out on the journey all who were able  to go and the rest of us went out to hunt cattle. I found  them in the Bluffs and drove them into camp and as the  men were out hunting cattle with the assistance of the  women and children I drove the encampment on and  when the men returned they found us gone and followed  and overtook us.    We got along well until we came  to the tremendious bluffs in Ash Hollow. Here my  teamsters Watts and Bess both smashed each a hind  wheel to pieces and broke every spoke out. I worked  until eleven o'clock at night to get the broken waggons  into camp and failing left them by the way side  and walked into Ash Hollow wearied out.    The next day was spent in  setting tires and mending waggons and the following  day being Sunday we held meeting and I advised  Elders Hardy and Petty to go on with the first division  and I would stop and mend up and keep some of  the second division with me. This counsel was  heard with great surprise by the First Division and they  did not feel to leave me but after much reluctance  the next day they left me behind according to my  counsel and journeyed onward.    After 2 days tarry setting 80 tires 
 putting new spokes into two wheels making new tongues &c we  started on and camped with brother Whipple who went the day  before. We then made two divisions of our company  and Elders Whipple and Gardner were organized with me.  The 3rd Division had 26 waggons and the 2nd 18. We made  this division to forward us on our journey    After the usual toilsome journey hunting of  lost cattle dying of cattle incidents with the Indians &c we neared  Great Salt Lake City on the 14th of October. I drove into the  City at the head of the company and was glad to gaze once  more upon the Valley of the Mountains--the New Home  of the Saints. I met with Elder George A Smith  and many others and I drove to the two rooms which I  had made while in the Valley before. President Young  had come out to meet me the day previous but he  returned and I did not see him.    The sickness and deaths in our  company occurred in the earlier part of the journey when  besides those named Captains Petty and Hardy were  very ill and myself and family had some little sickness  with the rest; but on the whole the journey was  performed with but few casualties of such a journey  and moderate mortality.    I set about arranging my affairs  and those of the company concerning our stock &c during   the first days after our arrival in Salt Lake city.    On the 16th I met in council  with Presidents Young Kimball and Richards and P.P.  Pratt George A. Smith and others. President Young  was sick in bed. The subject was discussed of  establishing a trading company to do business for  the Church instead of letting the Gentiles come in  and gut the Church. We adjourned until next day. 
 I met in council with the Presidency and Twelve  according to adjournment and it was thought best for me to open the  goods with Heywood and Walley.    On the 19th I moved my log cabins from  the old Fort on to my lot joining the Temple-Block    Next day was Sunday and I met  with the Saints in the Bowery and was called upon to address  the meeting. I spoke of my mission to the East and related  a dream. I dreamt of dying and going to the place of  departed spirits. I saw brothers Joseph and Hyrum Smith  and many of the Saints who had died. They all appeared  to be in a hurry and I thought it strange to find them  so. I enquired the cause and was informed that the  time was set for Christ to come as the great Bridegroom  and they had not time to prepare as those in other dispensations  and they had to be in a hurry in order to get ready.    Next Sunday George A Smith  address the meeting upon the words of Saul when he returned  from battle, "Obedience is better than sacrifice. [##1 Samuel 15:22##] He spoke  much upon the subject of tithing and was followed by  President Young who told the people the consequences of  neglecting this duty.    I met in council with the Presidency  in the upper room and had prayers before the Lord and  I read to them the speech of Mr Copway the Indian Chief  and also the views of Col. Kane upon the Government of  Deseret which I had recorded in my daily journal.    The Presidency on reconsidering the  affairs which I had to settle for my brother-in-law Ilus Carter  thought it wise for me to sell out his merchandize myself  and so I commenced to sell on the Monday morning and  the people crowded hard around my waggon to buy suggar  coffee &c as they had not had a supply in the Valley. 
 I attended the funeral of Elder Joseph Stratton  next day and Elder Parley P. Pratt preached his funeral sermon.    On the following Sunday I attended meeting  with the Twelve and Presidency and met with the Regency and much  was said in relation to schools &c.    And thus continued the several weeks  following attending to my temporal affairs selling out merchandize  preparing for the Winter going to the Kanyon and meeting  with the Presidency and Twelve.    On the 4th of December I met with the  Legislature. Governor Brigham Young had requested me  to meet with them and wished me to become a member of  the Senate.    Elected to the Senate  Dec 5th 1850    I met again to day with the Legislature of the State  of Deseret. The House of Representatives and Senate  sat in joint session. As there were two vacancies  in the Senate by the death of Bishop Newel K. Whitney  and Cornelius P. Lott the Governor appointed Wilford  Woodruff and Charles C. Rich to fill their places in  the Senate. I was also appointed by the Lieu Governor  as Chairman of the Committee on counties in the place  of George A Smith who delivered his farewell address  to the Senate and had taken his departure to act  as Chief Justice of Iron County. Many bills came  up to day and passed the Legislature.    Sunday the 22nd I attended  meeting at the Bowery and heard an interesting discourse  from President Young. His text was truth  his subject salvation his circuit the world  He said we see the child seeking the knife fork 
 poison raisor or something to hurt itself with: so with many of  the Saints and Elders. They seek for that which is  not good for them and they know it not. Many seek  for things which tend to death and not life. He  spoke of the desire of some to go to the mines their  use of tobacco and spirits &c.    On the last of the year I met with  the Presidency and Council of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company  and was appointed by the President a member of that body  and gave bonds to the sum of the thousand dollars for the  faithful performance of my duty as a member of that body  according to the rules governing the Council. Abraham  O. Smoot and Leonard W. Hardy were my bondsmen.    Thus ended another year the former  part of which was occupied on my mission in preparing  for my return to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake  and in gathering up the Saints the middle months in  our journey homeward and the latter end of the year  in the necessary business of daily life and preparing  for Winter and in a Ministerial and public capacity.    Patriarchal Blessing  of  Aphek Woodruf    Given by Patriarch John Smith upon his head  December the 20th 1850    Brother Aphek:  Beloved of the Lord—I lay  my hands upon thy head in the order of the Priesthood and  notwithstanding thy great age I seal upon thee a father's  blessing.    Inasmuch as thou has obeyed the 
 Gospel with full purpose of heart left thy native land disregarding  persecution thou hast passed through many trials and difficulties  thy faith hath not failed, thou art determined to persevere  in the ways of truth and righteousness and thy name is  written in the Lamb's Book of Life and is not to be blotted  out.    The Lord will grant unto thee everything  which your heart desires for thou art a lawful heir to  the Priesthood of the blood of Ephraim which Priesthood  shall be confered upon you in its fulness in due time  Thou shalt have power to heal the sick in thine house  and do any miracle that was ever done by man in  the name of Jesus when it is necessary for the salvation  of Israel.    Thy posterity shall become numerous  upon the earth and shall fill a station in the house  of Israel which shall endure unto the end of time    The days of your years shall be  according to the desire of your heart even to see Israel  gathered and Zion established in peace in the earth.    Thou shalt have health peace and  plenty while you dwell in the flesh. Thou art called  to do much good in instructing the Saints even to preach  the Gospel not only while you live but beyond the veil, shalt  gather thousands of the remenants of the house of Israel and  bring them to a knowledge of the resurrection of the dead.    Thou shalt live many years and see  much good accomplished among the Saints, be satisfied with  life come up in the resurrection with thy former companions  and all thy father's house to inherit a kingdom which  shall endure for ever and ever: Amen.    Our Sister Sarah B. Foss and her family  also received their Blessings at the same time. Myself 
 and wife Phebe W. Woodruff had both, (she in 1836 and I in 1837)  received our blessings under the hands of Joseph Smith sen.  father of Joseph the Prophet and First Patriarch in this Dispensation  presiding in that office. These Patriarchal Blessings of  myself and wife Phebe W. will be found recorded in the earlier  part of my histroy and they were now recorded together with  my father's and wife's sister and family into the Church records  of Patriarch John Smith who at this time also blessed  my wife Phebe W.    Before commencing to bless, Father  John Smith made some remarks upon the subject. He said  he considered the mark spoken of by Ezekiel set in the  forehead of the righteous by the one having the writers  ink-horn by his side to be the Patriarchal Blessings and  seal in the last days and John the Revelator had the same  thing in view when he spoke of the one hundred and forty  and four thousand sealed out of the Twelve tribes of Israel  He also spoke of the blessings of Abraham Isaac and Jacob  to their children the Patriarchs.    Synopsis  Wilford Woodruff  for 1850    I travelled through fourteen of the United States  organized a company of 209 Latter day Saints and  led them through the States and across the Plains to the  Rocky Mountains into the Valley of the Great Salt  Lake City making a distance of 4617 miles    I held Public Meetings 32 
 Baptisms etc.    I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 and administered unto  twenty sick persons.    Councils With the Presidency & Twelve    I attended with the Presidency and Twelve Councils 5    Senate of the State of Deseret    I was appointed a member of the senate of the State of  Deseret and sat in joint session with the Legislature  five days.    Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company    I was appointed a member of the Council of the Perptual  Emigratng Association and met with them in three councils    Regency of the University of Deseret.    I was appointed one of the Regency of the  University of Deseret    Letters  I received 126 letters and wrote 172.    Thus ended my labours and the events of my  personal histroy during the year and the Saints in the  Valleys of the Mountains had been greatly blessed and prospered  and had been fast building up their cities. 
 On the first of January 1851 I met with the  14th Ward of the City of Great Salt Lake to dedicate a new  school house which we had built for the purpose of schooling  our children. Elder Parley P. Pratt delivered a very interesting  address on the occasion and took for a text, "The fear of the  Lord is the beginning of wisdom. He was followed by President  Richards in a few remarks and the dedication prayer after  which remarks were made by W. Woodruff W. W. Phelps  and Bishop Murdock.    We met again at 2 o'clock and it was  moved and carried that Wilford Woodruff deliver a discourse  from the text "Bought wit is the best if you do not buy  it too dear". I addressed the meeting briefly. The  evening was spent in recreation under the direction of  the Bishop of the Ward.    I met with the Regency at the School  House on the 4th when remarks were made by the  Chancellor Orson Spencer concerning the classifying  of the scholars of this city. Much was said upon 
 the subject.    I also attended in the evening a meeting with the  President and Board of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company  Edward Hunter laid an account of his Summer's labour before  the board and his report and labours were accepted.    On the 6th I met with the Legislature  of the State of Deseret. The Supreme Court was in session  Two men were tried on the Saturday previous for stealing cattle  and two other men were brought in chains for breaking into  stores and stealing money.    The Legislature opened by prayer  after the adjournment of the Court, business commenced and  reports of committees were heard.    Next day a code of criminal laws were  presented to the Legislature and scanned closely through the  day without the assembly passing one section of the bill  The Governor made some interesting remarks to his council  in the evening.    The Legislature met again on the morrow  and both houses sat in joint session. The criminal  code of laws was re-taken up and during the day there were  many interesting debates upon the subject from many members  of both houses. The Governor in his remarks said  the law was written in their hearts and it was difficult  to put it upon paper and even in criminal cases it  should be left much to the discretion of the Court. Only  three sections of the Bill passed during the day.    On Sunday the 12th President  Young spoke upon the subject of swearing or taking the  name of God in vain. A covenant was thereupon  made by the whole congregation to put down swearing  throughout the city and State. The President said  that any righteous man who hears any of his any of my children 
 take the name of God in vain he might whip them until he was  satisfied.    On the 14th I met with the Legislature  and they passed several sections of the criminal code and during  the next two days other sections were passed and the criminal  code finished on the 16th.    Next day was spent in the Legislature  We had an interesting speech from Councillor Orson Spencer  followed by one from Governor Young    Joseph YoungPresident of the Seventy  appointed a two days meeting of the Seventies which opened  on the 10th at 10 o'clock. After the opening of this  conference of the Seventies Joseph Young called those who  were to be ordained as members of that body to come forward  when 104 came forward and were taken into the State House  and ordained under the hands of the Presidency of the Seventies  They then returned to the congregation which was large and the  assembly was addressed through the day and evening by  many persons. The Spirit of God rested upon the  congregation.    Sunday the 19th the people assembled  in a vast body. The Presidency, Twelve and Seventies  were in their places. The meeting was opened as usual  and then the congregation was addressed by Joseph Young  Lorenzo Young and George Grant and then President Brigham  Young followed.    President Young informed the Saints  that the time had come to begin to prepare to build a  Temple and the people must pay their tithing and he requested  the Presidents of every quorum to take the names of every  member of their quorum and they should sign a paper and  covenant to pay their tithing and they who would not do it  should be cut off from the Church. 
 He said "the ground wants to be laid off for a Temple  and Garden and materials prepared this season. A font wants to  be built and the endowments commence as soon as possible.  Those who went through the Temple at Nauvoo know but very  little about the endowments. There was no time to learn  them and what little they did learn they have most of them  forgotten."    Many other interesting remarks were made  by the President and he called upon the congregation to raise  their right hand towards heaven as a token and covenant that  they would help him build a Temple. This was done  unanimously    President Kimball next spoke and sustained  President Young speaking much to our edification and he was  followed by Elder Parley P. Pratt who spoke lengthily and to  much interest.    The meeting in the afternoon was  addressed by E. T. Benson Amasa Lyman and Wilford  Woodruff.    During the day Truman O Angel presented  to the congregation a plan of the Seventies Hall about to be  built. There were 30 others ordained to the Seventies  to day.    After the General meetings the Presidency  and Twelve met in Council and heard all the ordinances  read over that had been passed during the present Legislature  and next day the Presidency with several of the Twelve started  on a mission to Brownsville.    Returning on the 20th from my trip  to Cottonwood and elsewhere I learned that some brethren had  arrived from California bringing a mail with them bearing  the news that Brigham Young was  Appointed our Governor. 
 keys were sealed upon the head of Joseph Smith and still remain in the  Church. What are they to accomplish? As the Saints could not  be perfect in former days without the Latter-day Saints neither  can we be perfect without our fathers who have died for many  generations and those keys of Elijah confered upon the President  of the Church are to seal the fathers to their children and the children  to the fathers and to assist in welding the great link connecting  every gospel dispensation.    I see the wheat growing in this dispensation  ripening for the harvest. I see the tares also growing for the  burning. I saw too the wheat and tares grow on together:  I saw the goats and sheep both go ahead unto the end.    The Saints of God are increasing in  knowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times better,  wiser and advance in knowledge before the end.    I have watched the windings and progress  of this people and the Spirits that surround them. I have seen  many rise as it were to heaven and in a moment of temptation  fall down to hell and loose their hopes of Glory. I know the  spirits of men and the invisible spirits that affect men and operate  upon them better than I do the faces of men.    I want to speak a little upon natural  philosophy. We sow the grain. It dies—rots in the ground  and then it brings forth a hundred fold. The elements which  surround us produce these effects. If we had a correct knowledge  of the elements and know how to control and seperate them we  could make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus did  when he fed the multitude. The day will come when  we can go a journey without taking any food with us. We  shall then have power to make it as we go along."    Many other interesting remarks were  made by the President. Amasa Lyman followed    At the close of the meeting President 
 Young invited all the Twelve to come and dine with him. We did  so and feasted on a fine large turkey supposed to be the first ever  killed and eat in the Valley.    Captain Hunt met with us at Dr. Richards  office in the evening and made a report of Williams Ranch, said  he wanted to sell to our people. A company was to be  organized to go down and settle a stake or colony and to purchase  the Ranch.    On the 3rd     I met with the quorum of the  Twelve at Brother Bensons. Elder P. P. Pratt presided  pro. tem. There were present Parley P. Pratt W Woodruff  E. T. Benson and Charles C. Rich. The meeting ^opened^ with  prayer by Charles C. Rich and Parley P. Pratt then  presented the Record of the Twelve Apostles which was   read to us.    This record was since the filling  up of the quorum in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake  and it contained many items of interest.    After the Record was read and  remarks made it was moved and carried that the Record  of the Twelve Apostles be put into the hands of Wilford   Woodruff to be kept by him; and for him record such facts  as was necessary.    We then appointed a meeting for the  Twelve each Monday night.    According to adjournnment the  Legislature met on the 4th     to transact business for the  State.    An ordinance was passed granting to the  community a liberal charter protecting them in their religious  rights.    During the passage of this ordiance the  governor said "We do not want the Church to pass laws to 
 punish crime but only to try members on Church fellowship. If the  members shall transgress the laws of the land turn them over to the   laws of the land; but we want to protect the Church in their rights of  worship and so we will every other sect that comes here.    When the Kingdoms of this world become the  Kingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will they all be  members of the Church of Jesus Christ and obey the Gospel?  No not one eighth part of them. No more than a telestial  kingdom is a celestial one and they stand in about the same  relation one to the other.    If a society of Shaking quakers were to  come here and settle in this Valley and wanted a charter to be  protected in their worship let us give them one and if they  think it right not to marry a woman let them live without  it and not compel them to it.    So if the Latter-day Saints wish to have  more wives than one to live holy and raise up holy seed unto   the Lord let them enjoy that privilege.    Now the Gentile Christian nations  and Legislatures guard very stricly against putting any law  to do away with whoredoms but they will make it almost  death for a man to have two wives but they will have as  many whores as they please and they think this is all right  but for a righteous man to have several wives like Abraham  Isaac and Jacob David and others to raise up holy seed unto  the Lord who will keep themselves pure before God they think  this is an awful sin. But if I had power I would take  all good virtuous females from all wicked corrupt adulterous  husbands and give them to holy men of God that they may  raise up seed unto the Lord.    I have more wives than one. I have  many and I am not ashamed to have it known. Some  deny in the States that we have more wives than one 
 I never deny it. I am perfectly willing that the people of Washington should  know that I have more then one wife; and they are pure before the Lord  and are approved of in his sight. I have been commanded of  God to pursue this course."    Many other interesting remarks were made  by the Governor.    On the 5th     the subject of distilling spirits   in the Valley was before the Legislature. Many arguments  were brought up on both sides. The Governor thought  we should learn to handle and controle all the evils and that  we ought to be able to controle ardent Spirits.    Several days later I went to Toille Toollie  Valley with Leonard Hardy & Bro Celey upon business of many  cattle &c and returned on the 11th and thus I was from  time to time during the intervals of the more public events of  my life which I note engaged in attending to my temporal  affairs getting rock from the Kanyon building my house leaving   home for various business purposes &c.    I was in council with Presidency  and Twelve on Sunday the 16     the and the President said he  was affraid there would be a spirit with Amasa Lyman  to build up Williams Ranch and loose sight of this  "Remember" he said to brother Rich "if this is the case I  have seen the bud of it"    On the 19th     I was with the  President and others at the Council House preparing a room  for our Council.    I spent the 25th     in Council in the  uper room of the Council House and we had a good time  My father Aphek Woodruff was ordained to the office of   High Priest under the hands of Heber C. Kimball and  Wilford Woodrfuff. ^at this time^    The first of March     came and I 
 was 44 years of age on that day.    Sunday was the 2nd of March     and Parley  P. Pratt delivered to the assembly his farewell address previous  to his leave upon his mission to South America.    The Sunday following Jedediah M. Grant  spoke well on prayer faith industry and other matters and  was followed by President Kimball.    During the intermission President Young  Kimball and the Twelve called upon Brother Richards, and his sister,  Rhoda lay at the point of death. We administered unto her  and President Young said she should live and not die at this  time.    In the afternoon President Brigham Young  addressed the congregation upon the subject of building the  Temple Tithing & labour on the public works. He said  if every man was willing to do what was right there would  be no need of tithing. He would not be responsible   personally for the labours of every man on the public works  If the people paid their tithing. The wardmen would  get their pay. If we build Temples public  works or fit out missionaries to go abroad or feed the  poor it had to be by the tithing of the people.    He who spoke to of the merchants and  said that if they did not get their pay from those whom  they trust they were not to turn round up the Presidency  and Church for it.    Last Session  of the  Legislature of the State of Deseret  April 5, 1851        On this day the Legislature of the State of 
 Deseret met in joint session for the last time and after closing the  business of the day the Assembly was disclosed as a Territorial Government  was about to be established.    On the 22nd     President Young and many others  left the city to visit the bretheren South, I wote to Bro Kington  and spent the night with him; and next day prepared myself   to go on the journey with Ezra T. Benson. He came along  in the morning and I went with him to A. O. Smoots and  joined Presidents Young and Kimball and we started on our   journey.    We had in our company 20 waggons  and about 40 men in our visiting trip 250 miles to our Southern  brethren and to comfort their hearts. I thought there were. was   a company of the same members who ever left as much  bsuiness to get on a visit as we did.    An Account of our Journey South.    After we left brother Smoots we crossed the  mountain into Utah Valley and camped for the night. This  was the first time I ever was in Utah Valley. I found it  to be a spendid Valley of land.    The company went on in the morning  and I rode to the Fort on the South West side of the Lake  dined with some friends on some fine trout and then rode  to our encampment on the Provo Fort.    Next day I rode to Brother Behannan  and spent several hours with him at Hobble Creek. I here  found Walker the Utah Chief with his band. This was the   first time I ever saw him. I thought him an ugly  cunning looking chief. 
 Next day I rode with Brother Wells across the battle  ground where the Indians fought our bretheren with Brother Wells as  the leader of the Saints. He gave me an interesting account of  the battle.    We rode to Peletinck Creek where we met  the or teams who were appointed to go to Iron County. We travelled  to Summit Creek and camped for the night.    In the evening a meeting was called to   organize the Camp. Brother Wells was our captain  Brigham Young President and H. C. Kimball W. Woodruff  E. T. Benes Benson and Joseph Young Councillors.    President Young while speaking of the   ressurection said that we should receive the same bodies that   we lay down even if our chest was blown to the fourwinds  of heaven.    When we came in sight of San Pete  Settlement three days later we were saluted by the fireing   of cannon and waving of flags. We were receieved with  much warmth by Father Morely and the people in general  There were at this time about one hundred families in  San Pete. They were farming had a school house   and had commenced a Council House Etc.    I called upon Brother Brown Captain  Jones and other friends.    We held a meeting in the evening and  Brigham Young addressed the people. His belief  ^It was his belief^ that   the earth would not have produced for the Gentiles as it  had done for us and if we had faith and power with God  to have the curse taken off; as well as ^instead of^ the sage bush and  useless shrubs, we should have the apple pear peach  grape and every good fruit, but if this people do not take  a different course from what they do in some things then  blessings will prove a curse." 
 Elders Kimball and Woodruff followed President  Young in remarks to the people.    High Council Chosen at San pete  April the 30th 1851        We met this day for the purpose of organizing a High  Council. There were twelve men chosen and ordained to be  High Councillors and I were ordianed to be High Priests under  the hands of E. T. Benson and W. Woodruff. The meeting  was then addressed by John and Lorenzo Young and in  the afternoon by W. Woodruff E. T. Benson and J. M. Grant.    Next day May the 1st     we left  Sanpete in the afternoon travelled 10 miles and camped on  South Creek and next evening we camped on Salt Creek  Kanyon and on the morrow we went three miles up the  Creek to explore it. We visited one mountain of rock  salt pure and clean and the body was more than 40-  feet high and so hard it was difficult to cut it with an  axe. We also saw plenty of the quartz rock and  issinglass. We rode to the Severe and camped  on its banks and shot one deer while it was swimming   the Creek.    Sunday we crossed the Severe rode   25 miles through sage and camped on Cottonwood wells ^Bro Wells^  and explored the other Kanyon but could not get through.    Next day we crossed the mountain into  MaryVale and three days later travel and ^with^ a pleasant morning  brought us into a beautiful romantic mountain scenery  a gentle breeze and the air clear serene and healthy.    But next moring we were met  with a tremendious snow and hail storm in our faces  and we suffered much therefrom. We started early 
 before breakfast hoping to get down off the mountain out of the storm,  and travelled 25 miles before we stoped to eat. We came in sight of  the Valley of Little Salt Lake about noon drove down into a  Canyon made a fire warmed ourselves took dinner and there  descended into the Valley over a rough road of rock and sage  drove to Red Creek and camped for the night.    We had pressed over the worse road for the  few days past that I ever knew waggons to go over for we had  to draw our waggons up and let them down with ropes the  road was so sideling and we had to hold our waggons up to  keep them from turning over.    We camped within 4 miles of Ceder City  and during the evening George A. Smith and two other brethren  come down to see us. We found Red Creek a good  place for a settlement.    We took breakfast next morning and then  started for Ceder City and we were met on the way by George  A. Smith and a company of horsement who came out to   escort us in. When we arrived we were saluted by the  fireing of cannon and the flag of the Stars and Stripes  We took up our abode among the brethren in the Fort  Brother Benson and myself stoped with Bishop Robinson.    We found the brethren had done much  since their arrival in Ceder Valley. They were about 100  men had been there ^three^ months had enclosed a fort containing  19 acres and 96 rods of ground ploughed and sown about  1000 acres with wheat fenced 600 acres of land built a  saw mill and had got a Council House up the first story.    The next day was Sunday but as it was  a stormy day George A. Smith addressed the people for a short  time and dismissed them.    A company started out on the Monday  to examine the coal and iron but the President and 
 council remained in Fort to hold a council meeting and do such business   as was necessary.    A meeting was called at 11 o'clock to ascertain the  minds of the brethren. It was found that about 30 wished to go  home 15 to get their families and the other 15 to remain at  Great Salt Lake City. Each one made his excuse.    President Young then addressed them and   said he would express his feelings upon the subject to those who  wished to go home.    "If you were now on a mission to France  England or any other part of the earth preaching the Gospel  you could not sit down and counsel together about going  to get your families or going home until your mission was   ended. This is of quite as much importance as preaching  the gospel for the time has now come when it is required of  us to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. Our mission  is now to build up stakes of Zion and fill these mountains  with cities and when your mission is ended you are at  liberty to go and be free but only do right.    "When I go on a mission I leave my   affairs in the hands of God. If my house fields flocks  wife or children die in my absense I say Amen to it;  if they live and prosper I feel to say Amen to it and thank  the Lord"    President Young wished the brethren  to finish the fort and secure the grain &c, and to survey  the land so that the brethren who laid the foundation  could have the choice of farms.    On the morrow the brethren assembled  again and E. T. Benson addressed them in the morning  and in the afternoon the people were addressed by  John Young J. M. Grant and W. Woodruff and then  President Young followed and advised to have the logs 
 so close that arrows could not be shot into the Fort. He wished the  boundries of the city to be altered on the charter as there was a mistake,  also that the name was to be altered from Cedar city to the indian  name Parowan.    Next day we rode to Red Creek to see  the country. We had a feast at Brother Baylis house and our  exploring party returned from the coal and iron mines and brought  specimen and on the following day we rode to Summit   Creek where we could view the country 10 miles from the  Fort South. He concluded to return home on the morrow.    On the 16th the day on which we had concluded  to return we met the citizens to agree upon electing officers  President Young said he cared nothing about the feelings of the  nation who had driven us out. We should not follow in the   path of the political foolery. We should have one candidate  and but one as delegate to Congress. We can speak our  feelings freely here but when we vote let it be for the  candidate of our choice. Should we have two candidates  and they have about equal votes the United States would know  we had appostatized from our faith and union or that we  were trying to decieve them. We shall stand better in their  eyes to take our own indipendant course and act unitedly.   If we have had one track the Saints will walk on it: if  we had two tracks there would be plenty of devils to run  on them. If we begin right we shall go right we  shall go right if we begin wrong we shall go wrong  The United States are afraid of our union and so  is all the world.    In speaking of the Indians he said  these Indians are the descendants of the old Gadianton  robbers who infested the mountains for more than  a thousand years.    We dined together in the city of 
 Parowan and then left amid the roar of cannon and drove to Red  Creek and camped for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned  with us for Salt Lake City.    On the 24th we arrived at Great Salt Lake  City. One hundred horsemen came out to meet us and we  entered the city with the roar of cannon saluting our return  Our journey had been 500 miles.    Next day was Sunday. The people  assembled in the Bowery and filled the place and President Young  addressed the assembly relating our journey over the   mountains.    The following was deliverd on the next Sunday    Synopsis of A Discourse  by  President Yo Young  Delivered June 1st 1851    If a man does right he shall have the Spirit of God to  enlighten his mind in all things; yet all men will be  tried buffeted and tempted more or less in this probation and  he that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteously  angry he should let it sleep and not show itself until  he is himself again.    A good man may be left to commit  a gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped   the evil. The Lord intended for all men to be  tried in this life and if you build your faith upon a true  foundation that faith has to be tried.    All men have an apportunity of  appearing wise or foolish of governing themselves or  making their folly manifest.    Peter committed a gross error. Had 
 he been in the watchtower he might have turned away in the silence  and not denied his Lord.    Many have been tried and turned away from  us at a time when they expected to have gained something by it  and in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded and  overcome and done evil then their eyes were open to see the   consequences.    But if it is the privilege of all men to live  so that they can see what each act will amount to either good  or evil how different the prospect would be before of the world  of or even this people if they would live so from what it now  is.    I endevour to do right in all things and then leave  the event in the hands of God and am satisfied with the result  If a man is led or tempted to do a thing therof you do not   comprenhend the result of and that result not lead to good   then let it alone.    During the past week one remarked to  me that my observation of last Sunday ought to be made and was  good but it ought to have been spoken in the right spirit. But  I wish to say that I am satisfied with the power and influence  the Lord has given me. The Lord directs things according   to his ^own^ will.    I know my feelings and zeal would  make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that  they could seperate the sins from the people that they  should practise sin no more not to be tempted with  it; but this is not the will of God. The people still  must have their warefare and trial and if the storms  and waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we  have a good captain at the helm.    Some people are very anxious to  reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do 
 not know the spirit they are of. They are ready to say, "How do you  do Peter and Judas; Jesus and how do you do Mr. Devil and are  very pious and will go to hell and the whole world will go to hell  with the same spirit.    Awake ye Elders of Israel and make  your calling election, sure lest you go to hell with the  wicked. I do not point you to the Sectarian hell  where devils are tossing you with a pitchfork, in the billows  of hell fire eternally; but go and mingle with the wicked in  the States wrangle & fight with them get their spirit and  feelings and loose the light and spirit of God and you will  begin to feel the true state of the damned.    The wicked killed Jesus Christ out  of malice and wickedness and they did not know that  his death was to save the world. The Lord turns  many things for good which the world means for  evil.    The whole earth is filled with   misery sin and wickedness. I could find no worse  hell than to be confined among them. I labour for  the welfare of the whole people. I wish my bretheren  to be a happy free people that their course of life may  be such as to get an eternal and temporal salvation  I labour to effect this.    There is time and change to all things  There has been a code of laws given in former days  which was for all people—namely the Gospel of Jesus  Christ. In the days of Christ the Apostles  and Elders were sent out to preach the gospel and warn  the people. They did so but were then martyred   for preaching it and the Saints were killed off  the earth.    That time is gone. The change 
 has come; for now the set time has come to favour Zion to build  it up in strength power and glory — to gather Israel to build Jerusalem  and Zion to fight for our freedom and liberty.    We have sent the Gospel forth and preached  the Book of Mormon and the ministry of Jesus on this continent  in ancient days. Now the time is come to gather Israel  and polish them.    There is a great excitment in the world  about slavery; and the Abolitionists are fearful that we shall   have the Negro or the Indian as Slaves here. We have a few  who were prisoners whom we have bought to save their   lives. But what will the Abolitionists do? If you owe them  a dollar they will jug you up. Neither will they liberate the  Slave by buying them and setting them free. The master of   Slaves will be damned if they abuse their slaves yet the seed  of Ham will be servents until god takes the curse off  from them.    But they are not all the slaves who are   in the world. The whole world are slaves to sin and  wickedness and passion.    I have two blacks. They are as free  as I am. Shall we lay a foundation for Negro slavery?  As God forbid; and I forbid. I say let us be free. We will  be rich but we must be rich in faith first or we shall be  rich in no other way.    We must lay a foundation to manufacture  our own goods. If we do not we shall be slaves to our  enemies. We must stop living so dependent upon  our enemies and foreign markerts or it will make us  trouble. And this people must cease getting into  debt to the merchants for if you will get into debt you  shall pay your debts. But I say stop getting into  debt. Let no one come to me and complain that 
 he has got in debt and that the man will sue him and ought to   be cut off from the Church for you who get into debt and  wont pay your debts are the ones who ought to be cut off from  the Church.    Don't get into debt. Go in the Spring   and get the bark off the shrub oaks. There is enough in  this Valley to tan two hundred thousand dollars worth of   leather; and here your hides are rolling over the earth and  you are paying 50 cents per pound for leather and you  pay the merchants 80 thousand annually for shoes.  Instead of persuing this course if you will lay a foundation  for taning leather making cloth and what we want you will  be laying a foundation to build and sustain Zion.    I drove sheep to this valley and  brought others and brought a carding machine here to  card wool. Who ^will^ put it up? I have done more to  stock this valley than any to man in the place  I want others to do something. Set up the machinery  and make the cloth.    Is there any woman in this Valley  who will make me a suit of clothes? See if I do not wear  them. What is the spirit of the times in the world?  If a woman pays a great price for an article it is considered  very nice and all want some of the same; but you  get a thing cheep and all are ashamed to wear it— you  are looked upon with disdain if you do; but if you  pay a great price you are very respectable    There are many practices not right  To see men ride through the street; they go as though  they were in a hurry to get to hell. To men of   wisdom such things look vain and foolish but to  the world it look glorious and the mark of fellowship  with them is fine clothing and splendor. 
 I want the Saints to adorn themselves: first their  hearts with faith and grace and then their bodies with the workmanship   of their own hands. If it is silk and satin all the better  It will show your art wisdom and ingenuity in temporal  things.    True freindship is not known upon the   earth. If it it is not among this people; but the friendship  of this people is the fruits of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  This must continue to improve until they are perfect."    In speaking upon the subject of tithing  President Young thought there had not been $200 paid  in cash which there had been paid the merchants in  cash two hundred thousand and there were then  30,000 bushels of wheat due on tithing.    He said, "Shall we dispense with  tithing? Do you want a building to meet in to workship  God? We want a Tabernacle and a Temple for   our endowments also a tower to hang a bell on and we want   to keep building up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. If   we do this we do our duty. We have duties to perform and a  warefare to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours if we  can gain a victory with ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves  our wives and children we shall do well.    Synopsis of a Discourse  Delivered by  Brigham Young  June the 5th 1851        "I want to speak such things as are in my heart. All  that are acquainted with me know that my religion embraces  all things that belong to the duties of life 
 The religion I have, embraced all the principles of  present future progressive and eternal salvation in every sense of the word  I labour for the salvation of myself and my brethren. I would be glad  to speak to thousands even to the whole world if they could hear. I  would not like to preach in this house to 20 or a hundred persons when  more than 1000 could get in here and then for 20 or a hundred more  to come and to have to preach from 20 to 50 times to have the people  learn when they could learn all together.    The President of the Seventies called a seperate   meeting to day. I came and dismissed it. What if the Twelve  Seventies High Priests Elders Priests Teachers Deacons and Members  should do the same? There would be bare walls or the house to  preach to; and what good would it do? If the Presidency of the   Seventies have such important things to lay before the quorums   to get them together on Sunday let them come and teach us  all.    I now want to give counsel in this matter  from this time forth and forever; Let not the President of  any quorum ever again call a seperate meeting from the public  congregation unless the President of the church order it.    The Seventies should be here and all  the people should be here. Let the Seventies Hall go and  all other business when Sunday comes. Let the Seventy of God  come together and hear the Elders teach. Apply your hearts  with wisdom and get it. If I am full of the Spirit I  shall not get any more than I shall want. It is the duty  of all to come here who can come and let The power of eternity  rest upon us and you should not be asleep but wide  awake.    When I contrast the present with the past  situation of the Saints it gives me a great variety of feelings  both good and bad joyful and sorowful.    I have seen this people waiding through 
 a school of afflictions. They then were prayerful and had faith. Their  trying situation made them remember the Lord their God; but now  prosperity is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tried in all  things: when prosperity comes some forget God was fat and wide and  do not realize the blessings they are enjoying.    Some who are in poverty abroad desire to   gather with the Saints. When they arrive and get rich they forget  what they have been. Could you see the feelings of thousands   who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come here they would  be willing to lick up the dust of your feet if they could be here  They are still with the wicked. Bring them here. They look  upon many who were poor but now rich. They then desire  to be rich also. They want gold and will soon be willing  to sacrifice the society of the Saints and go to the Gold mines  and plunge themselves again into hell as it were from whence  they come to gratify an unlawful desire.    Thus it is with many men. Some  want to go to the Platte, to Bear River, to keep a ferry  to get gold and wait on wicked ungodly men. Were are their  minds? Like the fool's eyes. I told them I would not  wait on the devils for loads of gold. I would rather stay  here and serve the Lord All I want of property   is to serve the Lord and build up his kingdom with it.    I suppose many of the bretheren and  sisters are much tried to think they cannot have all they  want. I will tell you what ^to^ you do. Do  all you can to day and let the rest go till tomorrow  Do your duty to day and all will be right.    What good would it do you to  have 999 years to search and learn the revelations and commandments  of God if we have no time to carry out one of them  If any men want to get more revelation than they   can improve upon they are greedy dogs. 
 It will take twenty years to do the work that God  has revealed through the mouth of his servant Joseph, which  he laid out for us to perform before his death, even during  the last year of his life to say nothing of what he gave  before.    I will tell you your duty. Command  your minds from everything that is not for you to-day  and sit and worship God not sit and sleep. Worship the  Lord to-day. Go home at the close of the meeting and  get your food and rest, then come to meeting again  ponder and reflect upon the course of the Lord Jesus   Christ and his sufferings. If there is anything  necessary to be done do it and if an ox or an ass  falls into the pit pull him out; drive any beast  out of your neighbour's grain and put up the fence.    Do you meditate? Do you  pray in your families, and in secret to get the Spirit  of God?    You say you have your trials? I  have mine. I will tell some of them. Brethren  will come here to meeting; on Monday morning go  through my field leaving my fence down and let their  cattle and horses eat my wheat, borrow my cart waggon  shovel hoe and everything I have got and that without  liberty and never bring it home. If it was not  my duty to stay here I would lay my hands upon  some I could pick out whom I have confidence in  and would go and form a colony by ourselves and would  not admit of any person who was not proven.    I cannot get grass in the big  field but many of you do it; but I now warn you  not to steal any of my wood nor any of my  property for if you continue to do it I will put 
 a mark upon such men that they will carry all the days of their  lives. They are hypocrits and think all others are the  same. I dont love them very well.    Again I say to you, it is not your  duty to get in debt to those merchants. I say you  shall pay your debts. If you say you cant pay, I say  you shall pay them.    I speak of the faults of my brethren  You may ask shall we forgive our brother his trespasses  if he repents? I say yes. How many times?  Until seventy times seven in one day if he repents  and asks for it, even all sins except the sin against  the Holy Ghost.    If you will bring back my tools  grass grain or any of my property which you have  taken unlawfully and ask forgiveness I will forgive   you. I will not cast off any man until  he casts himself off. I will not reject any man  until he rejects himself. I will hold on to any  man as long as he has any prospect of salvation    An Address  Delivered by  President Brigham Young  June 15th 1851        I would like to say enough in few words to fill  three sermons. I have to deliver my discourses  in few words. 
 I wish the people to sustain the Priesthood as  the Priesthood. As to the opinion of man concerning myself  as a man I care no more about than I do the dust under my  feet. I dont care what you say about me, if you  will only serve the Lord our God.    Do this people live so as to know  the voice of the Good Shepherd? I wish to state one  item here which concerns you seriously. That is concering  the Indians here. They are ignorant have been taught  to steal and kill from their childhood and those who could  do the most of it were considered the greatest Braves and  Chiefs. As soon as they begin to steal here  many of you want them killed and compare their   circumstance with your own. You are taught  from your cradle not to steal or kill as it is a great  crime. Now do you kill a white as soon as   he steals? Weigh the subject well.    Those who wish them killed for stealing  a horse reduce themsevles far below the Indian. You love  them as well as I do but when the curse is taken off they  will again be fit for society; but while they are in their  dependant state it rests with as to use wisdom and judgement  in their behalf.    I say to the saints kill every white  man you see stealing and not kill the Indian for it for  the white man know better.    I speak to the Saints not as Governer   of Utah; but you and I are sent to save Israel not   to kill them.    Every Elder that crosses a certain  line I do not wish to see him; but those who do  right or seek to do right if they commit an error  we will forgive them. 
 I do not ask for influence only what God gives  me; neither will I give any man influence only what the   Lord and his own good conduct gives him; for if God does  not give a man influence all else will be of no use to him.    If I do the work of God all is well but  I will give no man influence only what God gives.    A few words to families who have not a   head to govern. They will be destroyed. The man is the   head of the family and should govern it. The hand may say  to the head if I really thought you would govern right I would  be governed by you; but I am afriad you will not; and  I want to govern you and dictate the head. Then the  shoulders and stomach will want to dictate. But does  not good sense tell you that your head should govern  your body? Your experience teaches the same  Your head didctates you what to do and when your head  dictates your body wickedly and polutes the body then  the head should be cut off so das not to polute the  body any longer.    George A. Smith remarked that  there wasere some bodies who could not act unless the belly  told the head what to do. In the strict sense of  the word    In the strick sense of the word no man  is quallified to judge and rule until he is qualified to rule  himself and he king over himself.    It is thus in families. Children  and mothers have you a good husband and father?  Let the wife rule the husband and she will keep him  tied to the dish cloth and kitchen all the days of  his life and it proves a curse upon him    There is a curse upon man that I  would not take off if I could for in the experience  you have you are led to salvation through our Lord 
 Jesus Christ    Do you know your calling matters? It is  your duty to brace up your feelings as men have to do and be  mistresses of your house.    I go to the house to rest. The mother  says I cannot govern the children; I wish you would; but  this is not right. The Elders of this Church have to go  abroad to preach the gospel. They cannot be with thier   children. When they come home to spend a little  time they want to dandle their children upon their knee  and not go to whipping them.    The mothers should govern them  until the sons go with their fathers into the field. Then  let the fathers govern. I can govern my children  when they are with me. I would rather one of my  sons to stab me to the heart and kill me dead than  conquer and master me.    In government when any undertake   to govern out of their place they do not prosper   As an example; Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor undertake  to govern and control and set right my affairs at   Winter Quarters while I was on a pioneer journey  to the Mountains and they were likely to have destroyed  many; but I said Peace be still and I saved  the people.    I say to mothers in the name   of the Lord God of Israel do your duty. Dont ask  the Father to whip the child. Do it yourself if   necessary and let the mothers control their daughters  until they go to their husbands.    But let the man rule and  preside over his household. And I say to the  men do not go home and abuse wives because 
 of what I have said but treat them kindly. What would you  think of a man who would get up before a glass and tear his  own heart out? As well of him as I would of a man who  would beat and abuse his wife."    An Address  of  President Brigham Young  Given June 22nd 1851        If I can see the motives of the heart of man  and know eternal things by the Spirit of God it is far  more beautiful than to hear the words of men    Should an angel come and converse  with any man in the congregation no other one might  know it. He would think the person spoke to  him as one speaks to another face to face when the  angel would not be seen at all only by the Spirit of  God or by vision.    We may know by the Spirit of God  what is in a mans heart before he speaks. At  all times listen to the still small voice of the Spirit  of God and it will save the Saints from many  snares.    If you get angry dont sin nor let  the siun go down upon your wrath. I do not  expect to see perfection in man, not what the  world calls perfection. I have seen a perfect  Peophet and perfect Apostles: that is perfect in 
 their calling; but not the perfection the world looks for. If Joseph  had been as perfect as the people wished him to be he could  not have lived with the people nor stayed this side of  the veil as long as he did. We could not have heard his   voice nor have seen his face: he would have been veiled.  Israel could not endure the face of Moses at times.    The Lord expects us to be in the  path of duty. When we get in eternity we shall be  angels or Gods. We shall there advance to the Godhead  if we do right.    In speaking of the law, what a   simple thing it is? What is the law to those who  do right? It is not made for anybody but the  transgresser and the lawless and wicked. If we do  not infringe upon the rights of others all things are ours  in heaven and earth, time and eternity; life and death  because earth and hell and all that is therein is ours.  If we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being  we shall become Gods and fill immensity as our  Father in Heaven does.    I can weigh all the sleepers philosophers  and learned men of the earth in a scale and know just what  they weigh and can circumscribe them all.    All is mine: heaven earth and hell, —  wives, children; and I am Christ's and Christ is God's.    It is not known to us where the  stakes are set to God's immensity. Take the world  at large. Can they get to the end of their chain when  they get to the mill pond?    It is a startling idea ^to think^ that we are  worshiping a God who was once in the situation that we  are in ourselves. They had to pass through a  probation of pain suffering and the fall like ourselves 
 and be made perfect through suffering. The Son of God passed  through it and the Father would not require of a Son what he would  not do himself.    All our sufferings will exalt us in the presence  of God if we endure them patiently.    A word of advice concering leaving. I   never want to hear of another law-suit among the bretheren.  Is it anything but good common sense to never have another  suit before a Judge to say nothing of revelation? It does not  require any great perfection to accomplish this. Let men do  right. Do your neighbour good not evil.    The Lord will burn up the earth and  clense it as you would an old pipe.    You think it hard to have to water your  land here but it is far more healthy than to have rain. It   was so in Egypt. If It did not rain more in Illinois and  Missouri that it does here it would be far more healthy   there. This could be reasoned upon natural principles.    A word more upon lawsuits. There   would not be a lawsuit in this Valley if all men would  do right and were Saints; but the net has gathered all  kinds good bad and worse. Let twelve men get  drunk in this community and it ruins the place in the  estimation of good men. We have to bear the character  of drunkness and a few stinking fish in the net defile  it and the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudice  against it.    Those who were acquainted with Joseph  know that if he dealt any in temporal things it created  a prejudice against him. He bought many goods  to help carry on the public works but the people  were ready to get it all away from him. So it  is now but I say unto all men who are Saints 
 put to your hands and help build up Zion and the Kingdom of  God. We are scholars in the great school and must learn  We are a Kingdom and must bring the Kingdom in subjection to  the will of God.    An Address  Delivered by President Brigham Young  June 29, 1851.        I join in testimony with the brethren, I wish to be a doer  of the word. I feel the importance of the last speaker Brother  Spencer.    Those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom  will not be invited to the supper; and the time is near.    Jesus Christ is an example to all Saints  He was filled with wisdom in his youth; but in his childhood  and infancy he was like other children. It has been said that   he was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the case  He was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome by  it.    If we have become acquainted with our follies  let us put them away and apply our hearts to wisdom. Let   us have compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion  on us.    We should increase in wisdom until the day  of perfection. ^out^ Apply your hearts to wisdom and it will produce  peace health wealth and every good thing.    Should you see a people carry out  the principles of wisdom, peace would be the fruit and you would  never see contention unto the day of your death. Ask the   world if they do not like a people who live in peace and are 
 contelnted and they will say, Yes; it is beautiful.    Take the world of the present day time; and they  are like wolves and eat each other up. They fight and contend  and devour each other. The Abolitionists become heated and say  the negro must be made equal to the white man at the table and  all other places. They will at the same time turn away  the widow and orphan and put into prison a poor man for debt  ^out^ Instead of this we should feed the hungry and do good to all men  as we have an opportunity. Then we have a Zion. His   peace in the heart.    We should bear an evil from a friend as well  as our enemy. You ask the Lord to bear with your  infirmities so we should bear with each other.    What is the necessity of doing wrong having   law suits and contending with each other. Go to law and  spend $100 to collect $5.    You may be told you are indipendant  and have rights. You have a right to do good and not evil. The  God I serve will deal out good to his Saints and everything  that is necessary for them and reveal his will unto them and  teach them what to do. He will not lie or deceive me. I   will ask O Lord, did you do this or that? Did you bless  this man or that man so and so or did you suffer that evil?  Yes I have done this to try men. Do you want me to do  so and so?    If I am going to do a thing I ask is it  the will of God? If I cannot get the will of God upon  it I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong.    We want to do right: then we prosper  Is the people doing right? Is the Kingdom growing?  Are there principles in this Kin^g^dom to govern all mankind  with?    All that the nations of the earth now possess 
 would not make this people happy as they now are. Give us  the Kingdom of God instead of the glories of the world.    There has been a great stir to exalt the  negro and make him equal to the white man but there is a curse  upon the seed of Cain and all hell cannot wipe it out and it  cannot be taken off until God takes it off.    When a A person unlawfully seeks for power and  exaltation by taking the blessings which belong to another  He he will sink far below the other. As Lucifer the Son of the  Morning sought the glory that belong to Christ the First Born  and was thrust down to hell so Cain sought Abel's blessing  and took the life of his brother. The consequence was  Cain was cursed and his seed and this curse will remain  until Abel's posterity will get all the blessing there is for him  Then the curse may be taken from Cain or his posterity will  but his posterity will be below Abel's. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]    All are slaves. Polititions are   the worse slaves. And if we dont do right we too shall  catch the lash. We are the freest people on the earth  Queen Victoria is a slave. She had to ask the liberty   to marry Prince Albert; but we are free. We have the right,   God and his Kingdom.    Let us not dishonor God his Kingdom   or our brethren. If we dishonour our brethren we shall  sink below them and their children. If the wife dishonour  her husband the children will dishonour the mother and   she must welter under it.    Honour the Priesthood in all its parts  be more faithful be more prudent. Administer to the  wants of all as far as you can."    Other remarks were made by the  speaker. 
 Fourth of July 1851        In ^the^ celebration of the Indipendance of America the city  of the Great Salt Lake poured forth her inhabitants in good  order with her "Legion" of military ^men^ as an escort to the Governer  and citizens.    The procession organized at the Temple square  at 9 o'clock in the morning to take a ride to the Great Salt  Lake. There were about 140 carriages and waggons  besides the horsemen. The car containing the band of  musicians was drawn by 16 mules.    We arrived at the ^Black^ rock on the Lake  at 2 o'clock. We held a meeting were addressed by  Governor Young and several orators who spoke much to the  edification of the people. In the evening many  went into the Salt Lake to bathe. at 10 o'clock the if signal  was given for prayers when all assembled within the corrall  prayers were offered up & the encampment retired to rest.    It was as pleasant a Fourth of July as  I ever spent and my family was with me. Next day  we returned to Great Salt Lake City.    Discourse  Delivered by  President Birgham Young  Sunday July 6 1851        We get good from all men who speak by the Spirit of 
 God according to their calling. I speak freely; so may all  men. If we speak incorrectly we shall be corrected. We want to  speak freely that we may gather good whether it is in the past present  or to come.    Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professes  to be a scholar; I do not, but he has murdered the English language  to day. I want speakers to speak the English language  correctly for our childrens sake.    As to principles there are no principles  in heaven earth or hell but what the Saints have to apply  in their prayer place.    If we could understand all things we   should know that here is the place to begin to make the people  happy. If we could understand the dealings and Providence  of God with us and the object of it there would not be the  discontent and murmuring of the people that there now is  but we should have peace and joy and contentment concerning  spiritual and temporal things.    I would say that temporal and  spiritual things are one; but what we call temporal are the  coarser things which we see with our eyes but the finer or  spiritual things we cannot see with our eyes unless They are  touched by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual  things.    To say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal  things is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put out  their own eyes to spite their neighbours.    Anciently God angels and eternal things  were considered natural. My mind can see many  things when clothed with the Spirit of God that my  eyes cannot.    In speaking of hell it is called very  hot but our God is a consuming fire. Hell is here. 
 It is said the Devil was cast down to the earth; also that he was cast  down to hell. He is in our midst striving to lead captive the  children of man.    I want the brethren to speak freely, to speak  all that is in them and if they have an error let it out and exchange  it for true principle.    Some of the Saints want more revelation  mysteries, great things; but do they know what they ask for  or what they have already got. If the request of many men  were granted it would be like casting pearls before swine.  They would trample them in the mire.    We have enough now of the Key words and  tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world and  lead us to the throne of God and what more do you want?    Have you ever pondered in your hearts  by visions and the Spirits of God eternal things even the  redeeming of all worlds and from them down to the smallest  things God has made? Have you ever reflected upon  the great system of salvation of the creatures of God?    Is man contented? He is not.  Can man alter the decrees of God concering the seed of   Abraham or anything else? He cannot. Why not  quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father?    When the Father appointed Jesus Christ  the First Born to come and redeem the earth there was  contention got up. ^The second Brother^ Lucifer the Son of the Morning  wanted the honour to come and redeem the earth; but  Christ was the appointed one. It was his right by  appointment and birthright; but the war and contention  became so hot and the influence of Lucifer was so great  that he got one third part of the host of heaven to join his  standard; and when he was hurled down to hell like  lightning from heaven, one One third was cast down 
 with him. Where is he and those spirits that were cast down with  him? They are here on the earth and have blinded the children  of men and who are still seeking to overthrow the Kingdom of God  but this is all right    But this  is all right and we should be contented with what God sees fit  to grant unto us and be contented with our lot. If the devil  had been contented and acted in his place he would not have  been thrust down to hell.    Any man who seeks to do a thing he  cannot do and should not do is cast into hell: it makes a   hell for him. When a man asks for a things of that  does not belong to him it makes him unhappy; but do what  God wants you to do and wait on those who are above you  and all will be right.    Why did not one of the Apostles quarrel   with Jesus Christ to redeem the world? Jesus set a little  child in their midst and said if ye do not become as this  little child you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.    If you would be the greatest man in the   Kingdom of God you must be the greatest servant. You  will do more than any other man.    The Apostles did not quarrel to know  who should or should not be President. Why do I or you  not quarrel because we were not Joseph Smith?    To want to, and cannot is hell! Never  seek to do a thing you cannot accomplish. Every man has  [h]is lot appointed him and he should be contented with it  There is the work of God ^angels^ men and Devils.    Is the Bible good? and the Book   of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants? Yes they are  good. Those books contain the works of God angels   men and devils; and if you dont want to be in hell  all the time be content with your lot. If you dont learn 
 to be contented with your lot ^you will^ in hell with brother Kempton who says he  was in hell one year.    Then learn to be content and you will be happy  Dont complain about you are not God Jesus Christ an angel Joseph  Brigham a man a woman ^a brother a mother^ a son a daughter or anything else; but  be content with the lot in which God has placed you: there you  will be happy and blessed.    The blacks cannot take the curse off themselves  until God takes it off. So the Lamanites are cursed but is  there and blessings for them? Yes the same as there is for the  Saints for Joseph Brigham and Jesus Christ and all ^faithful^ men and  women in their time and season. So be content."    Among the remarks of the President the next Sunday  he said,    "Why should we not know our own talents and abilities  as well as others? If we do not there is something lacking  Concerning singing there are some men who know sound and  ^others^ those who do not and those who do not, ought not to sing. We should  act upon what we know and let the rest go."    Upon the remark of Sherwood that he thought  we were kicked out of the frying pan into the fire" the  President said we were kicked out of the fire into the middle  of the floor. When people get their eyes open to see that  their interest lies in the building up of the Kingdom of God  then the Kingdom of God will roll on and the people will do   better.    I spent the next day in council and  heard two letters read from our friends Col. Kane    Synopsis  of 
 A Discourse   Delivered by  President Brigham Young  July the 20th 1851    Brother Kempton was very anxious to preach from the  text Abraham's bosom. Liberty was granted him and  President Young followed and said:    "Bro Kempton has had his liberty as  is given to every man who speaks here. He has not  satisficed his mind at all. He may have much in his  mind but can say but little here. He is not able   to handle the Scriptures and know all the spirtis in  the world as some can.    When the dark sayings in the   Scriptures are understood they are plain. The  Scritpures here that speaks of Abraham's bosom is not as  given by brother Kempton. Abraham is in Paradise.   Lazarus is with him.    For me to explain is to tell the truth  A man that feels and talks to the people should be a Bible  of himself. If a man that teaches and leads the people  is not filled with truth so as to be able to teach the people  without quoting the teachings of others altogether, then he is  a blind guide and will go to help with those he leads.    It is the intention of the Lord to teach  man principle in progression until he shall know all things;  that he may rise through faith power and victory until he  obtains every good thing, even to rise to be gods, even the  sons of God. This blessing we cannot obtain without  experience.    We should not sin when we are tried, but 
 and tempted, but overcome, which will give us glory honour and eternal life.    As fast as I improve upon what I have more will  be given me. The Savior was subject to all that we were from  his birth to his death. He applied his heart unto wisdom. We  should do so too. Apply your hearts unto wisdom from day to  day and you will receive all that he did.    If I through out all that is in me what faults  I have will give place for truth and that which is good.    I feel to praise the name of God for all  that he has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab's continually.    All persons see times when they wish truth to  pervail. Mormonism is all truth. The Lord has raised  up a Prophet and Seer who brought it forth and established it. He  was faithful unto death and sealed his testimony with his blood.    A certain prophecy says when the Book  of Mormon shall come unto the Gentiles the Jews shall be  gathered to Jerusalem.    All truth is ours in heaven earth and hell.  It is all truth we want. But does the Church or Elders want  correcting? Yes for they have errors and false notions. The   net has all kinds of fish. We have some as cursed rascals  among us as dwell on the earth and we find evil here as well   as anywhere else. Yet Zion is here. It is in my heart  Peace dwells with me and good principles will prevail here  until all evil is overcome even in all the earth.    Let no man find fault with his neighbours  until he is righteous. I dont ask anything of others that  I wont do myself and never find fault with another about anything  you allow in yourself. Dont you swear scold and do wrong  yourself? Then dont find fault with another for it until you  subdue your own passions and the evil that is in yourself.    Some will do anything to preside over   another when they cannot preside over themselves. 
 Now remeber this that we will have Zion when  all wickedness is gone. We have got to fight, fight, fight, until  we gain the victory over ourselves. Remeber this and overcome  What are the feelings of my heart? It is to bless them ^the people^ and  do them good.    July The Twenty Fourth [Figure]  1851.        The anniversary of the enterance of the Pioneers in  the Valley of the great Salt Lake this day was celebrated with  much display and enthusiasm by the citizens.    At the rising of the Sun the stillness of   the morning was broken by the roar of cannon saluting the  rising Dday. The mammoth carriage of the Nauvoo Brass  Band was soon in motion and the band sent forth on  the wings of morning strains of martial and inspiring   music. The citizens poured forth from their homes  dressed befitting the occasion of a celebration and gathered  together a congregation of rejoicing people.    The order of the day was kept up by  the firing of cannon 110 times and the procession paraded  the streets. The escort consisted of the Nauvoo Brass  Band the Military Band and the Pioneers of '47 the  Regency; the Aged Fathers; Young Ladies followed by the  Mothers in Israel; young girls; young men and young  women. The Presidency and the officers of State formed  the escorted party.    After the escort came the rear party of  the procession, 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of the combined  wisdom and strength of the kingdom of God in the last days  The numerous flags and banners the various emblems of art. 
 agriculture and industry with the music accompanied the procession which  started from the President's residence to the Bowery.    The burst of feeling in music singing speeches orations  toasts &c during the exercises in the Bowery was truly delightful. "Here  was the power of truth the literature of God's Spirit the eloquence of Apostles  the laws of the Kingdom of heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in a  strange land and the harps hung not upon the willows."    The shades of evening come over the city but no  accident had marred the proceedings of the hallowed day nor curses  drinking rabble or strife.    In many respect this day was the most interesting  one that had come in my life. My father myself and my children  making three generations of my linage were in the escort.    The 1st     and 2nd of August     I spent Harvesting  I had 20 acres of wheat. Five acres of 7 headed wheat yielded from  100 to 70 bushels to the acre. The harvest was good this year.    Dr. Bernhisal on the Sunday gave an account  of his procdings of Washington and his obtaining a library for Deseret.    I spent August the 25th     in Council with  my brethren and during it the mail arrived from the States. It  was 20 days from Indipendance and was the largest up to this date  ever received in the Territory being about 1000 lbs.    I received three letters one from Ilus Carter   one from my brother Azmon and the other from my brother  Thompson! My brothers informed me in their letters  of    The Death of My Step-Mother  Azubah Woodruff  March the 20th 1851    She died at half past 7 o'clock in the evening. Also Elizabeth  wife of my brother Azmon died January the 3rd 1851. They  were own sisters by birth. 
 I found from my brother Azmon's letter that  he was in much sorrow. He was baptized into the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with myself the last of December  in 1833. He was ordained an Elder and myself a Teacher with  the hands of Zerah Pulsipher. Elizabeth his wife with the  assistance of the Devil made war upon my brother and caused  him to leave the Church. He had been in sorrow ever   since.    On my arrival home with my letters I  called my aged Father into the room with me and read him  the letters from his two oldest sons containing the news  of the death of both his own wife and his son's wife  My father was resigned to the Providence of God.    A Special General Conference of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints  Held in the Tabernacle  Great Salt Lake City  Sept 7th 1851    There were present the First Presidency — Brigham   Young Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and of  the quorum of the Twelve Orson Hyde W. Woodruff G. A.   Smith and E. T. Benson, the first seven Presidents of   the Seventies and the other quorums and a large congregation.    President H. C. Kimball arose and said  the Conference was not for the benefit of one but for the whole  "Is the Store House full of wheat? Is the tithing butter and cheese  brought in? Some of you will ask can I get my endowments? 
 But I will say not one of you will get your endowments until you pay your  tithing."    President Young arose and said:    "As far as you can exercise patience  you should do so. We are in comfortable circumstances and  now let us sit here and worship God and let our business rest and  let us reflect a little and exercise ourselves on our religion. Let  our houses rest and farms and crops and let the people be  still and not talk in the house or about the window.    In my meditations I am like other men  who refelct; and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects  that will soon perish.    How many there are here who ask the  question, "How long will the conference last? I want to go. I  cannot stop." While others will be willing to stop ande  worship God.    Some Spirits are like the troubled sea, weary.  If I could have my wish about it, I would wish such spirits to  pass out of our midst, leave the congregation and let us worship  in peace.    We are such an industrious people that we  could not commence conference until Sunday. I care as  little about our gardens farms lumber &c as you do about  snuffing ashes.    If you get all the riches of the world  you cannot hold them. If you will get the wisdom   if is your privilege to possess you will know that God  cares more for you than the ravens. If you seek the   Kingdom of God and its righteousness the Lord will add  all things else that is necessary.    Our first duty is to provide for our  families, but we must take a course to accomplish it  Fools are often rich and the wise in begery. This is the 
 providence of God. We may be ever so rich to day; we may be  beggars to-morrow. This is the case with those who are before me  Let me draw the line between the good and the evil. Have you not  had more good than evil? — more than you would have had if  you had been in the world? More peace than in the world and  happiness in the meditations of the things of God than in the world?  Yes you have. Then shame upon the man who complains of   his hardships.    The worse persecutions of the people are their  best days. I went to Missouri in 1834, walked 2000 miles  in 70 days was so weak I could not step over the fences three  feet high. I now have better health and strength than  ever before. I would give all Geauga county for the experience  I have had in six months.    Now stay here. Dont go home until  conference ends. Many of the Saints forget Mormonism.  Any body who enjoyed the light of the revelations of Jesus Christ  must have the Spirit of God. The key to Mormonism is all  the truth in all eternity that ever was revealed or ever will  be that exists with God angels or men. Where shall I go  to find truth? In Mormonism. If you get a truth  anywhere it is there for that covers all truth.    When the light came to me sin did not  revive in me and I died but I revived and lived. I had  not consented to the death of any good man like Stephen  as Paul did. [##Acts 7:56-60##] [##2 Timothy 4:6-8##] But let him come to any of the   Churches reared to his name and the world would kill  him if they could.    I will ask you, are you accepted  of the Father and the Son? You will say I don't know.  Well it is because your minds are taken up with the  things of the world. Then let us stay here  until we know. 
 I am a Mormon or what is called so and I know  that Joseph was a Prophet. It was revealed to me long before his  death. I always thought while reading the world bible about a   Prophet that I would go around the world to see one or any man  who knew things as they were and not have to guess at them.    Everything will have to bow to Mormonism  or eternal light and truth. We have the true government of  all the earth. I know the path this people has to walk.  I am prepared for Mormonism. There has no better man  than Joseph Smith ever lived on earth. Hear it O ye  Heavens, O ye Earth and all men: This is my testimony  that he was as good a man as ever lived since Jesus.    Thise world will not vote for a man  because his religion governs. They will not have God govern  them, because of their cursed meannesss; but if God did  not or can not deal out justice and rule in righteousness,  who can?"    E. T. Benson, Orson Hyde, George A.  Smith and Wilford Woodruff followed in speeches and then  President Young again arose and said:    "I read that when the wicked rule the  people mourn. Ask the world, do the wicked rule?  Yes; and they mourn. Do they week a righteous man  to rule? No. If the curse has followed the rule of  the wicked will follow. But let them sleep on and  take their rest; but we understand the Lord has rent the  veil, sent angels to us and the Gospel is preached to the poor.    The difference between us and the world  is that they say but do not, believe not. We say and   both believe and do. The world spend thousands  of dollars to preach the Gospel but do not believe it.    When the judgements of God rest upon  the wicked and they are cut off then will be the gleaning 
 of the grapes after the vinetage is done.    Let the righteous reign and the righteous will  rejoice in the house of Israel. God takes up the isles as a little  thing; builds up and pulls down at his pleasure and why are not  the people willing he should reign? Because of their meanness.    Some may ask do not good men reign?  I will ask a question: Should an angel come to President Filmore  and tell him how to govern ^the nation^ it and he was to tell of it would they  not shut him up in a mad house? And if God was to reveal  to him truth concerning the people and he was to tell of it the  people would kill him. This is the situation of this  government—the best on earth. But let the President sware  take the name of God in vain and curse God in all its  forms they willould let him and ^stay with them as^ hail fellows well met.    The nation will be damned and  go to hell who killed Joseph: The States of Illinois in  connection with the carthage mob, and the whole government  sustain it and they will be damned from the President to  the least member.    I think no more of a King or President  than of the poorest beggar. The worse scoundrel is the  most popular man in the nation    This nation is the first the Gospel  was sent unto. She has killed the prophets that God  sent unto them and their doom will be the neither most hell."    Testimony of Willard Richards  To the Mob at Carthage    Willard Richards said    "We have had much testimony to day  I will add a few words. When Hyrum Smith fell in  Carthage Jail and exclaimed "I am a dead man Joseph fell dead 
 John Taylor fell wounded. I carried him to another part of the jail  and covered him up. I walked out before the people and said that  Joseph and Hyrum Smith ^who lies before me slain are two of^ were the best that ever lived. Joseph  Smith was a Prophet of God and Hyrum a Patriarch. Two better  men never lived; two better men God never made."    "Joseph was a Prophet. Brigham is as great  a Prophet and he that believeth it may be saved and he that  believeth it not will be damned."    Judge Brochus and the People.    On Monday morning September the 8th     and the  second day of the conference Judge Brochus requested the  privilege of addressing the people and it was granted him.    He arose and commenced his speech  by testifying of his kind reception among this people. He  had been sick among them he said and kindly treated.  The flys had been brushed from his face by a lady and he  was thankful.    He then refered to the Judiciary and   requested the people to sustain it and professed to be very  sorry that he was going to leave it. He then refered  to a report in circulation that he came here for the purpose  of being returned a delegate to Washington and other  things that were reported against him &c.    Next he took up the subject of his  appointment and said that President Filmore had appointed him  although he was a democrat; and observed that he should  not have been appointed had he not been a capable virtous   was a good man.    He then addressed the ladies upon 
 the subject of the Washington monument and wished them to procure a  block of marble and present it to Washington; also wished them to  donate for the building of the monument and talked much about  Washington and his battles and good deeds.    He spoke of the perscecutions of the Saints  considered them badly treated, had sent to Winter Quarters where  our dead was burried and had a sprig of myrtle plucked  He carried it in his bosom. It was now dryed up. He  showed it to the congregation.    In speaking to the ladies he said he  hoped they would become a virtueous people. He did  not wish them to send the block of marble unless they   could do it in full fellowship with each of the seperate  States composing the United States.    He had read something casting  reflections upon the United States Government concerning  our persecutions; but he would defend the Government as  long as he had a tongue to speak or hand to lift; and  said the Government could not do anything for us as they  had no power; but if we wanted redress of our wrongs  apply to Missouri and Illinois where we had received  them.    This part of Brochus speech stirred the  blood of the whole congregation; and much more was said   by him calculated to arrouse the indignation and  wrath of the people.    President Young's Reply.    President Young arose and said that Judge Brochus was  either profoundly ignorant or wilfully wicked in presenting  some sentiments which he had to the assembly that  day. How he supposed for a moment that Brochus 
 was going to throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religious  meeting and presented such sentiments as he had he should not for  a moment have given his consent to the Judge to speak on that  occasion. The President said several stood by and wished  to take up the challenge given by Brochus but he would not  permit of it for some might have got their hair pulled if not  their throats cut and he would not have it.    The President then wished the meeting to  adjourn and the assembly to meet again in the Conference and  transact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting  had been called. Meeting adjourned for one hour.    After the adjournment following previous speakers  Heber C. Kimball spoke. He said "I will tell one tell one  thing that will have a great effect upon us and remove the  mist. When we come to the house of the Lord bring  an offering to the Lord. I will make an offering to  the Lord and the Priesthood as Abraham did to Melchezedic  And offer the best you have.  Did not this law come  from Joseph who was ordained under the hands of Peter?  Brigham  Young was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keys  of the Kingdom of God. If you strive against him you  strive against God who sent him."    After Brother Heber had spoken President  Young then arose and said:    "I will speak of principle. You may  think it is a novel Conference. How long has it ^been^ since  we have had the privilege of spending a Conference undisturbed?  A long time.    I would like to hear brother Kempton  speak or any good man. I will preach brother   Abbot's funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all   the faithful. His body is laid in the dust to rest until the resurrection. For ever blessed is the man 
 September 1851        who lives and dies a Saint.    I will tell whether the messenger sent to brother  Kempton was of God or the Devil. If the messenger was  not of God he would know it. If the messenger was anywhere  else but here he must have come from heaven or from another  hell for we are in hell    Go to the world and preach the Gospel.  You will find some people as honest and good as angels as far  as they know; but do they have revelations from God and know  the things of God. No they do not. If brother Kempton  has had his sins forgiven and remitted without baptism so  could all men. But this is false. No man could  have forgiveness without the sheding of blood and baptism.  The Bible says unless you Keep the commandments you  cannot be saved.    When brother Kempton says he knows  his sins were forgiven before he was baptized he knows  not what he says. At times the Spirit of God is  given to men to see the Kingdom of God and they think  they are in it when they have not entered the door of   baptism.    Dont go and tell the different denomination  that because their sins are not forgiven that they are always  going to dwell in hell for if they are honest they will have  a glory greater than many who carry the Gospel to man.    There is a good people among all sects  Gentiles Jews and Heathen as there is on earth. They  act according to the best light they have.    What is the condition of this government  Light has come into the world and men love darkness rather  than light. They rejected that light fight the   Prophets and shed their blood. For this they  are damned." 
 September 1851.        In the afternoon the officers of the church was   presented and then President Young said.    "I want to establish some travelling Bishops, a thing  which we never have done. When I approach the subject of  Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to take  time and look at it all day until we can see clearer than we now  do. This people stick to the world love the world. We  should use the world not worship it. No man is free  indeed until he is free in Christ and above the world. Don't  worship the world. You will not be free. Is there any  one that has anything but what God gave him. You cannot  make one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to   feed clothe and sustain the families of those who are in  the vineyard preaching. If we let them suffer and they die their  blood will be required at our hands. We as a people have never  done it ^yet^;  but it is time it were done. The Bishops are reproved  They dont do their duty."    John Banks and N. H. Felt were ordained Travelling Bishops  E. T. Benson, J. M. Grant and Orson Hyde were set apart  to go back to Kanesville and gather out all the Saints in that  region.  Samuel Richards was appointed to go to England and  also Willard Snow and A. O. Smoot; D. Carnes to Germany  and Dorr P. Curtis and Venson Shirtliff on a foreign mission  and Dr. Dunyan to the Eastern States.    John Smith the Patriarch said he had  been in the work since Jan 1832 and was about the oldest  man here. "I was ordained an Elder under the hands of   Joseph Wakefield. The Smith family was chosen to  bring forth this work. My team halled the first load  of stone to build the Kirtland Temple. My son George  A. drove the teem. There were four brothers of us  in the stand inKirtland. I am now left alone  I was in jail with my nephews Joseph and Hyrum the 
 September 1851        night before they were killed. Next day three guns were snaped at   me. I could not weep for a long time. When I did weep I  wept much. I have laboured much from that day until this to  keep things right. It is said that it is the little foxes that spoil  the vines. We have a Prophet for a leader. Now pay your  tithing and make good measure when you sell anything, and fulfil  all your covenants if they are made right. We shall then prosper  in this Valley. I am an old man and cannot say much  but I will write a piece to be published in the paper."    H. C. Kimball said "I am going to make  an offering to President Young. Abraham paid tithes to  Michezedick. A certain woman gave a purse others filled   it. Brother Rhodes gave sixty four pounds of gold for  the public works. He has not lacked anything. You  should give the best you have to the Lord. He will  pour you out a blessing that there will not be room  enough to receive it."    After others had spoken President Young  said    "I will put the motion, will the sisters vote to quit  using tea and coffee? The brethren have voted not to  use tobacco.    I will speak of the Bishops. I spoke of  them Yesterday and reproved them sharply. Some  wanted me to offer an apology to them. I will not.  I will see them in hell before I will do it. If this people  do not do better than the Bishops have they will and  if you do not do better than you have done you will   go to hell.    I will begin with myself. I have  taught the Bishops principle and their duty. Ask  them if they can do it. No. I will cut the Bishops  off from the church if they do not do better. Did I 
 September 1851.        ever council them wrong. You have trampled my counsel  under foot. I shall not shrink from duty.    I say to all old and young learn to pray  Pray in your families. Be content in all circumstances  where the Lord shall place you.; cease your contentions  one with another; never go to law; gather your famlies  together and pray for me and my brethren and yourselves until  a blessing rests on us."    Others spoke and then President Young again  during the day. He said he wished to say a few words to the   Mormon Battalion.    "Those who are wanting their extra pay are  applying to Williams Blair and Babbit. If you apply to  those men and give them the papers and they cheat you out  of it dont complain and I say to those men not to take  any papers from those fwho have had their pay or sold  their claims to others. If you want your pay apply  here and you can get it.    You did not enlist to get $8 per month  They enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentiments  we are accused of treason. I dont ask any odds of the   United States. I will express my feelings. To drive  us from our mullions and our possessions ^and then require us to fight their battles^ is not right.    I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve  will pay one tenth of their possessions and the Bishops and  all will pay their tithing.    This is the Kingdom of God and if it  falls I am willing to fall with it. I would rather fall  than stand if the Priesthood falls."    All the people covenanted to pay their  tithing and Bishop Hunter and others spoke. Upon the  remarks of Elder John Banks upon the law of liberty  President Young said: 
 September: 1851. October    The liberty of the holy Gospel is peace and righteousness  We have no liberty to take away another man's rights; but the  first principle of liberty is resignation and submission for go  where you will to heaven or hell you have to submit to laws  We are at liberty to adopt every holy principle to all eternity.    Go East West North or South. Keep  everything ^you want for^yourselfves wife children houses and cattle and create  out of the elements everything you can; Yet you are not at liberty  to infringe upon the rights of man.    You may have the privilege to  do all things that is done in heaven. Organize the elements  give commands and rule over Kingdoms but be subject to  such laws as you are under. The law of liberty is to  do right for God to all eternity. The opposite principle  is to be discontented with things: to be different from what  they are. This is hell and all the hell there is.    I dont care how things are if I   do right. We shall find the law of liberty to  be eternal life light and peace which will increase to  all eternity.    We ought not to do an evil to cause  pain to any creature; still there are some things which  appear to be evil that I know to be good.    God will increase his Kingdom to  all eternity. Abrahams seed will reign as kings of  kings and lords of lords and to his seed there is no end.    Let this people live and do right  and the blessing of God will attend you to all  eternity.    The Conference was adjourned to the  6th of October 1851.    October the 5th was Sunday the  day before the Conference. In the morning Elder O Pratt 
 October 1851.    and George A Smith preached and in the afternoon the President  spoke: the following is a synopsis of    An Address  Delivered by  Brigham Young  October 5th 1851    .    We hear the brethren arise and return thanks for the  blessings received. We can respond to it. The work is  of all importance to the human family. The brethren are all  willing to do right; and they say Lord not my will but thine  be done. If the Lord should say come and preach to us we  would say Amen to it.    The Lord has his means to carry on his  work and also his own means to do it. When the people's  hearts are prepared to do the will of God the victory is ours.    If we come to understanding so as to   have the organization of the Kingdom so that every one will  act in unison like a beautiful piece of machinery we gain  the victory. We shall then know how to order our speaech  and converstaion aright before God.    This is a good people. Cannot we  be better? We have faith and knowledge. Cannot we  have more of it? Yes there is an eternity of it.    We have learned to obey by the things  we suffer. But what do we behold? There is evil surmising  spadeaking and doing. The evil intruders hadve not left us  Who is keeping the commandment that thou shalt love thy  neighbour as thyself? We will save his neighbours  garden crops &c. We shall then believe and practise 
 October: 1851.    all the commands. We shall have but one common interest. I  dont care what you believe if you practise right and as though you  loved the Lord and then you will do right.    There is no school like your own experiance  When I heard George A Smith speak I thought of former days  when men from Canida and other places would stop 50 miles  this side of Kirtland leave the money with the wife go and  see Joseph say how I love you; but let Joseph ask them for  a few dollars and they would immediately dodge at it.    While you were in the world you  would go away. Now you are here I cannot get you  to go to the fat Vallies because Warsaw and Carthage are not  there. I felt like crying about Amasa's company. They  were ready to go to hell. How ready the perople are to go to  hell! Let the eyes of the Saints be open. I had  to be pleeid pled with Amasa Lyman and company for days not  to go. I could not stay them. Now I want you  to go and you wont go. I want to have you go to  Iron County. The people here are so full of wheat and   good things that they loathe it. If you dont want to pay   your tithing the Lord dont want your tithing until you  go into hell. If you dont want to save yourselves  nor your children nor your dead dont you pay your  tithing; if you do want to save them pay your tithing  for it is for your benefit not mine. You cannot  do the Lord any good in it nor add to his glory  but it is for yourself.    The cattle have come in well of late  and I think the best have been sent in. You should  be industrious and saving. I do not want anmy  children to be lazy. If I die I do not want any  man to foster them in laziness idleness. I wish my boys  had to work as I did for a living. 
 October 1851    General Conference  October the 6th    Conference assembled according to adjournment.  President Young said the time had come to commence  the business of the Semi-Annual Conference. The business of  the last Conference was productive of more good than any Conference  we ever held. The keeping of the "Word of Wisdom" has done  much good. I will be exceedingly glad when we arrive at  wisdom in all things.    The Word of Wisdom was given in Kirtland  twenty years ago for the benefit of all Saints. When we  live 20 or fifty years longer we shall see that we do not  understand much of the Word of Wisdom.  We are but babies  in understanding wisdom. Who understands it, were all  spoken that might be spoken. There is but one system  of explaining any revelation and that is the revelation of Jesus   Christ in the heart of man when he prossesses the Holy Ghost.    We are forbidden to eat meat in hot  weather. Hot drinks and tobacco is not good for man  You should not eat to over loading your stomach. There  is a greater lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my  food and ^exercise^ than in eating meat or tobacoo.    Tithing is coming in so fast there  will  not be room to receive it.    I wanted this Conference to come together  so that I could see their faces not to scold them. I want  to see the faces of the Saints. They look better to me than  all the glories of the earth. I said when the brethren got  out of prison I wanted o sit and look at them three weeks.    Our Graineries and Store House are full 
 October 1851    of wheat and good things.    If this people are rich beautiful and happy,   I am with them; if they are miserable, I am still with them  if the people are not all crowned and saved none of us will be.    It is in vain for one man to build himself  up and neglect his brother's interest. He will fail in it.    We must begin to manufacture all we want or  we are slaves to everything in all the earth.    Everything is against Mormonism, and Mormonism   is against everything; everything is against us. Hear it  O Earth for the Kingdom of God is against all earth and hell  This is true and we shall fight them until the kingdoms  of this world become the Kingdoms of our God. We shall  fight battle after battle until the victory is won. We  have to fight and lay down our lives for Christ's  sake.    We now want to gather companies to  go to the different Valleys. I want the potters to remain  here and work at their business.    Jesus descended below all things  before he assended above all things. We have to sacrifice  ever freely in order to be exalted before God. I once  said I will go and build me a house on the hill  out of the mud. Joseph said you will stay where  you are. This was enough. I dodged as quick   as I could. I said, Enough. Since I have been   willing to be governed by circumstances that have   surrounded me and leave the event in the hands of  God."    Judge Snow then spoke and afterwards  the President said:  "At our Conference we appointed Felt and  Banks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops and 
 October 1851 December  call them to an account and see that they are faithful Bishops  and you should feed the poor and do your duty until the Spirit  of God rests upon you and you hold the Keys of the Melchezedick  Priesthood and the power of it rest upon you forever."    Brothers Banks and Felt were then  ordained under the hands of the Presidency.    In the afternoon Joseph Young O. Fulmer and  Zerah Pulsipher ^and Alfred Cordon^ were appointed as missionaries and after a discourses  from H. C. Kimball, and from George A. Smith upon the   opening of the new settlements President Young closed with  an address upon the education of our children. This was  one of the most interesting conferences ever held by this people.    President Young's Medical Lecture.    Delivered before the Board of Health  At Great Salt Lake City  Dec. 1851    "I wish to impart intelligence to the people. My first  proposition is the science of health medicine. The study and  practice of medicine as a science, if it may be called a  science is the most imperfect of any science in existeance  as it is practised by the doctors of the present day. The  doctors and priests of the day send more to death and  hell than anywhere else. About one in a million may  get some glory. A bigger set of cursed scoundrals  never graced the earth than that class. Surgery is a  different class and is very necessary in many instances and  that system can be learned. But to learn the system  of man they cannot: no more learn that than they can  learn the heavens. 
 A worse set of ignoramuses do not walk the earth  They do not know how to turn wind in a man's body when it gets  cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats the people will  live. I know what this society is here for. It is to  import what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen  the folly of the doctors even at my own doors. Take them as  a whole they are the most damnable set on earth. Their practices  are infamous and their medicines produce death. If the people  want to eat calomel let them do it and be damned; but dont  feed it to any of my family. If any doctor does and I know  it I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding arsnic  I do not employ such doctors to visit me. I do not employ  any doctor to visit me.    The practice of doctors in visiting women  in childbirth is damnable. Women should be let alone  and let Nature have its perfect work. Let a woman keep  her child if she can two or three years but she cannot do  it. When the time has come Nature will deliver  her of her child without a doctor. Dont fret. Let  everything take it's proper course and sickness willould depart  away.    The doctors in New Haven ^Ct.^ met by mutual  agreement to see how far they could frighten a man and did  actually frighten him to death, a robust hearty man.    Many things should be said to this  people. There has not been a doctor baptized into  this church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledge  he is a fool. There is not a physician in the church or  in the world ^that is taught from on high by revelation^ but what will acknowledge this to be a true  doctrine: If there is a doctor who can see and know  man from head to foot and know how to care his diseases  by revelation such are the only true and safe doctors on earth  All other are fools. 
 I see medicine ^men die^ in the hands of the doctors. The medicines  kill them. Why dont they tell what ails the patient or acknowledge  they dont know. The foolery there is among this class is disgraceful and  makes me mad and the day will come when you will not wonder at  my feelings.    You are natural persons and God has made you  natural. If you are with child that child will come forth by  nature without a doctor. The earth is just so will bring  forth of itself seed after its kind.    If a person is sick and has not faith to be  healed give them herbs the products of the earth and it will care  you, until it is time to die.    When a cat is sick she will eat catnip without  a doctor, and she gets well. Nature prompts her to it  If a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the earth  and lie in the ground until the poison is gone. So nature  will teach us as well as the cat and dog. When a toad is bit  by a spider it will go and eat plantain if it can get it.    If a child is to die in being born let  it die but dont employ a doctor to kill it. How will you  be instructed? I will tell you what to do. If  you are  taken sick dont be frightened but be calm. If you  get a cold let Nature be judge. Disease will go up and  down through the system to find a place to be located.    It is as much our duty to know how   to cure our system as to feed our body. The doctors would  say you are diseased but dont know it. Who made the  doctors? The Devil. The Lord did not make the  doctors of the present day.    Such a thing as a man midwife   was not known until about the year 1500. Why did not  all the women die before this time? Look at the Indians  for one thousand years. Millions of children have been 
 born in the wilderness male and female and they live and not die  without a doctor.    You may ask what shall we do? I will  tell you. I will give you a lesson and I want you to  remember it. When you go to visit a woman in travel  let her alone until her full time has come. Remember  it and let the mother alone. Let your system be  natural. Teach them also to execise all they can  that when they come to be delivered it iwll be better  for them.    A doctor if he had good sense would  not wish to visit women in childbirth and if a woman  had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor  her on such an occasion.    I want you to teach your  children the truth principle of birth.  I talk as I do  for the people will not sense anything unless they are  half knocked down or thunder rolls in their ears  soft words will not do. I want you to hear  and understand.    There has been some difficulty in  this Board of Health. If I had been with you, you  would not have had any difficulty. It has been  through misunderstanding. If you understood  prinicple you would not quarrel. You may spread  Calomel on your bread and butter and eat it if you  wish but it is as deadly poison as arsinic but not  as quick. It is not good. You may ask if  it was ever good in any case? There are cases  where it might be a benefit; but it would want a   revelation to tell when it was.    There is not poison in lobelia.  I will give 5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz. of 
 poison that can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this Valley.    It is not probable that any two persons are  organized just alike in all respects. Then who is a physician  None, unless he be taught of God and is a prophet or revelator  he cannot understand the human system know disease and  what will cure it.    I dont care how a man acts if he intends  to act right and when he acts wrong is willing to be righted.    We will take the best physician of the day that  lives the closest to the Lord, I dont care how well he is  he will be brought down as a fool, for he will be made to  let God be honoured    I have been on a journey in the dust.  I have got dust on my brain: that is what ails me. It  will work off. Could a doctor tell what ails me? No.  Can a doctor tell what ails a sick man by feeling of his  pulse? No more than he could by feeling of a dogs tail   There is no Physician unless he is taught of God.    You should learn how to doctor yourself  You should study your own system. Any people who  must trust to a doctor at all times will die. But trust  in God and you will live longer.    What a different time it would be if all  trusted in God rather than in the doctors; for 9 out of  10 die under the doctors' cure who would live if they trusted  in God alone. Dont get frightened and and you will   do well enough. It is just as reasonable to send for a  doctor to have a calf colt or pig brought forth as it is  for a chlid.    After you have received your resurrected  bodies you will bring for Spirits to all eternity who   will go to some world and take a tabernacle or body the  same as we have. You dont want a doctor anymore 
 here than there.    If the membrs of this society are true either  male or female they will impart all the useful knowledge they  have to others. If they are not willing to do this they are  corrupt. If one man knows more than another let him tell  his knowledge and if a man knows more than all the rest let  him be a father unto the people and teach them and not act like  a boy. If I hold myself equal I am equal. If I listed  myself superior let me manifest it by doing a better deed and being  superior myself.    It is the man that rejects light and knowledge  when shown to him that God condemns and I condemn him  Some say we have spiritual wives but I think God has made  us all natural and I think we should be natural."

The whole distance there and back was  seven hundred and sixty four miles.    Meetings &c: I attended 28 public meetings and  preached 14 discourses.    Baptisms &c    I baptized nine persons and confirmed nine. I   ordained 12 of the High Council 10 High Priests and  8 of the Seventies.

On Monday the 5th the Legislature  of the Territory of Utah met according to the appointment  of the Governor and on the next day the House met  and received the Governor's Message.    I continued to meet with the Legistlature 
 till the 5th of Feb when the Session adjourned until the 16th., when  it After the ajournment the business of the House  ^was retaken up^ but the Legislative proceedings was too lengthy and unsuited for my   Journal in detail. I however give the following items from  the mass of matters that came before the House.    Census of the Territory  in 1852.    Great Salt Lake County: Contained a population of  six thousand one hundred and fifty five souls.  Davis County: Contained a population of one thousand  one hundred and twenty eight.  Utah County: Contained a population of two thousand  and five souls.  Sanpete Co. had a population fo three hundred  and sixty five.  Green River Precinct with forty six persons.

Extract From the Proclamation    Of Governor Young to the inhabitants of the Territory of Utah  to set apart the 1st day of January as a Thanksgiving Day.    "And I recommend to all good citizens of Utah that they  abstain from everything that is calculated to mar or grieve  the Spirit of their Heavenly Father on that day; that they rise  early in the morning of the first day in the New Year and  wash their bodies with pure water; that all men attend  to their flocks and herds with carefulness and see that no  creature in their care is hungry thirsty or cold while the  women are preparing the best of food for their households  and their children ready to receive it in cleanliness and with  cheerfulness: Then let the head of each family bow down  upon his knees before the God of Israel and acknowledge  all his sins and the sins of his household, call upon the  Father in the name of Jesus for everything ^blessing^ that he desires  for himself, his kindred, the Israel of God, the universe  of man; praying with full purpose of heart and united 
 faith that the Union of the United States may be preserved  inviolate against all the divices of wicked men until truth shall  reign triumphant and the glory of Jehovah shall fill the whole earth  Then in the name of Jesus ask the Father to bless your food and  when you have filled the plates of your household partake with  them with rejoicing and thanksgiving; and if you feel to make  merry in your hearts sing a song of thanksgiving and lift up  your hearts continually in  praise and acknowledgement of the  unbounded mercies you are momentarily receiving."    An Address  By  President Brigham Young.  Jan. 4th 1852.    President Young took for his textsubject "Sin and the forgiveness  of sin."    "I speak upon this subject because we are in the  midst of it. It has been among all the elements; it has been  in our houses in our families and in our hearts and although  it has been our constant companion there are but few who  understand the nature of sin.    "Many have made themselves miserable  by thinking they had sinned against the Holy Ghost; others  that they had sinned a great sin. But what have the  revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects?    "We learn that Jesus Christ came and  took a body and redeemed the world but that Lucifer rebelled  and was camst down without any body and he has sought to  vex and destroy the children of men. He seeks  diligently to draw all from the right path especially if a   Saint tries to follow the track and get where Jesus was 
 then the Devil will try hard to overthrow them.    Many have thought they have committed much  sin when they have not understood the nature and works of sin  We must understand many principles and arrive at much knowledge  before we can ^fully^ understand the nature of sin.    The vaieil of darkness is over the earth so that  the inhabitants of the earth are so overwhelmed in tradition and  darkness they do not know light from darkness truth from error  right from wrong or the difference between the dictation of the  Holy Spirit or that conscience which has been framed for them  by the dictation of their mothers and Priests. Many think  far more of the traditions of their youth than of any principle  that God could reveal unto them. Their mother must not  do anything on Sunday. To darn a stocking would  be a great sin.    Sin is one thing and tradition another. The  word of God revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will  not.    The education of the world is good as far as they  have any truth found in science which they possess; but  they do not understand truth in connection with the plan  of salvation.    I want the Saints here to understand that  they cannot sin against God and Jesus Christ and the  Priesthood against his ^their^ families and the Saints and then come  and ask forgiveness of the Church then pass on smoothly  and think they will go to heaven. This is too cheep a way  to get to heaven. I want this subject riveted on your  hearts; if it is not you will not remember it.    You must remember your covenants and  the law of God that is given to us. It is written that sin  is a transgression of the law. Where is the law? In the  books that is given us in the main; yet this does not go into 
 all the meanderings of life. Where do you find a law that  you shall not drive a teem across your neighbours lot not go to  his hay stack or suffer your famlies to take liberties that  you are not willing should be done to you? Yet you know  it to be wrong. But do unto others as you wish others to  do unto you is the law and the Prophets.    Some men who have been ordained  unto the Priesthood and are very high in authority will take  the name of God in vain and swear by this and that.  Does such persons suppose that the Church can forgive that  sin? If you do your hope is in vain. They  can never forgive that sin?. No man can do it. None  but God alone and it never will be forgiven until he does it.    The time will come that if a man will   take the name of God in vain he will be hewn down without  judgement or trial. Hear it O, ye Elders, for it is  time. Let this people sanctify their hearts, and then  take the name of God in vain and it will not be forgiven  The time will al[s]o come when the parents are sanctifyed  before the Lord and their children rise up in disobedience  against them and they will be hewn down.    If you sin against God and take  the name of God in vain if you get forgiveness you will  have to be forgiven by Him and not from man.    Some think if they are alone and sware  or sin nobody will know it; but they will find themselves  mistaken. Still if a man has to sware let him  be alone. If a man damns himself let him be alone  that others may not be polluted by his sin.    If you take the name of God in  vain I will not forgive it, for I cannot. If the Lord  will forgive you I will forgive you for maring my feelings  by speaking in my ears. 
 The more you see the veil parted and the more ^you^ we  learn the more you will see that God's ways or not as our ways  This people are passing through a great school of experience. I remember  while in Kirtland that if any of the brethren felt their rights infringed  upon in anywise or abused they would retaliate and be ready  to quarrel about it and get up a lawsuit for a debt of three dollars  But the minds of Saints have become more noble.    Now if a man is abused who understands  principle he is above quarrelling about it and he feels to say  it is nothing to me: I am not to suffer by it; but you who  have abused me have the penatly to pay. But if the devil  can only make you think that you are abused or ill-treated  and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil power  over you in the end it is as bad as though you had done  wrong yourself.    Now if a man sins against you until  seventy times seven and he repents and with an humble  heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him for this is  the law. He must ask forgiveness and be honourable  or he cannot be forgiven.    As much as been said, and many  fears entertained concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost  I wish to speak farther concerning that subject. To  sin against the Holy Ghost is a sin against God the Father  the Son and the Holy Ghost that bearseth witness record of them  A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost until the  Holy Ghost has revealled unto him the Father and the Son  and a knowledge of eternal things in a great degree. When  he has a knowledge of these things and with his eye open  he rebels against God and defys his power, he sins against  all three. If a man does sin against the Holy   Ghost the people have nothing to do with it; for they  cannot forgive that sin and none but God can do it, and 
 probably he will not in this world nor in the world to come for  they become sons of pedition and probably will never repent of nor  have a disposition to.    If you blaspheme the name of God dont  ask this people to forgive you ^for they cannot do it &c^. If God forgives the sin then  you can go down into the waters of baptism. When you get  knowledge you will be ashamed to sin.    Now I want to bring this subject home  What are the acts of the people? Do they not sin and trespass  against their brethren, parents against their children and children  against their parents, the husband against the wife and the wife   against the husband? This is with us and this we can reach  and manage and tell what ought to be done.    You ought to cease from taking the  liberty of any person and do unto all as you would wish them  to do unto you. Infringe upon the rights of no one; borrow  no tool but what you will return according to promise. Take  no wood nor anything else but what belongs to you and if  you find anything that is not your own do not hide it  away but report it that the owner may be found.    If I had some stones here I could  cast them and hit two or three in this congregation in the  head who are guilty of these acts. You may say why  dont you tell who they are? Why you poor devil are  you not going to repent of it by and bye? If not when  the day of clensing and sanctifying of Israel comes you  will have to be sacrificed and your blood spilt upon  the ground; for the day will come when iniquity must  cease in Zion and the profane man who takes the name  of God in vain will be slain.    In the days of ancient Israel Justice  was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood  principle and revered the commands of God. 
 It was a mercy to many to have justice and  judgement executed upon them on the earth even to be slain and have  their blood poured out upon the earth that it might be tolerable  for them.    God made a covenant with Abraham and his seed  that he would save them. When they committed sin he  slew them that he might save them by their sprinkling ^spilling^ their  blood as an offering. Had they had lived in sin they might  have sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. It  was a mercy to slay them.    Now brethren if you sin against God  go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death. There  is a sin unto death which we are told we need not pray for.  If you sin against your brother go to him to get forgiveness  Ask forgiveness at the hands of the innocent. If you   sin against your family your parents your husband  your wife your child seek forgiveness at their hands;   but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secret  and go no further that sins may be hid. But if  sins are committed openly they should ask forgiveness  and be forgiven openly. These are true principles  and let them be remembered forever    Goverenor Brigham Young's Address  On Slavery    Before the Legislative Assembly of Utah    The whole world are slaves. Eve partook of  the forbidden fruit and also Adam and this act  brought slavery upon all their posterity in some way or 
 other and this will continue in some way or other until we become  righteous enough to drive the devil and evil from the earth.    Adam had two sons, Canin and  Abel. Cain was more given to evil than Abel. Adam  was called to offer sacrifice so also were his sons. The  sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Cain's and Cain  took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he  killed Abel. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]    The Lord said I will not kill Cain  but I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the  face of every Negroee on the earth and it is the decree of  God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cain  and the Curse until all the seed of Abel should be redeemed  and Cain will not recive the Priesthood or salvation until  all the seed of Abel are redeemed.    Any man having one drop of the seed  of Cain in him cannot hold the Priesthood and if no other   Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name  of Jesus Christ. I know it is true and others know  it.    The Negroe cannot hold one particle of government  but the day will come when all the seed of Cain will be  redeemed and have all the blessings we have now and a great  deal more but the seed of Abel will be aheiad of the  seed of Cain to all eternity.    Let me consent to day to mingle my  seed with the seed of Cain and it will bring the same  curse upon me and it would upon any man; and if  any man mingle his seed with the seed of Cain the  only way he could get rid of it or have salvation would  be to come forward and have his head cut off and spill  his blood upon the ground and it would also take the  life of his children. 
 It is said that if a man takes ^kills^ another he takes  that which he cannot give. If a man's head is cut off his life is  not destroyed nor his Spirit. That lives. His tabernacle is  destroyed. But I can make as good tabernacles as I can  destroy. If you will not believe it look at my children.    Much blood was shed in ancient times  both of man and beast. The firstlings and best of the   flock was sacrificed on the Altar; and in some instances  many men and almost whole nations were sacrificed or put  to death because of their sins and wickedness. This was the  only way they could be saved at all.    If Jesus Christ had not had his blood  shed the blood that he received from his mother Mary  the world would not have been saved.    There is not one of the seed of old  Cain that is permitted to rule the reign over the seed of  Abel and neither you nor I can help it.    Those that do bear rule should do it in  righteousness. I am opposed to the present system of  slavery. The Negro should serve the seed of   Abraham but it should be done right. Dont abuse  the Negro and treat him cruel.    It has been argued here that many  of the Jews were black. Whenever the seed of Judah  mingled with the seed Cain they lost the Priesthood and  all their blessings.    As an example; let the Presidency Twelve  Seventies High Priests Bishops and all the authorities say  Now we will all go and mingle with the seed of Cain  and they may have all the privelegies they want; and  we lift our hands to heaven in support of this.  That moment we lose the Priesthood and all its blessings  and we should not be redeemed until Cain was. I 
 will never admit of it for a moment. Some may think I dont  know as much as they do; but I know that I do ^know^ more than they.    The Lord will watch us all the time  The Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am determined  he shall not rule at all; and Negros shall not rule us, I  will not consent for the seed of Cain to vote for me or my  brethren. If you want to know why we did not  speak of this in the Constitution it was because it was none  of their business.    Any man is a citizen black white or red  and if the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite blood  in them they are citizens and shall have their rights but  not to rule for me or my brethren.    Those persons from the Islands and  foreign countries know nothing about governing the people  The Canaanite cannot have wisdom to do things as the  white man has.    We must quarrel against all evil. I am  not going to let this people damn themselves as long as  I can help it."    An Address  Delivered by  President Brigham Young.  Feb 8th 1852.    I trust in the Lord for light as I have heretofore done  When the minds of men are open to understand they will see things  as they are. We are subject to all the evils which there are  in the world.    I have thought this world as fallen as any of 
 the creation of God. When the Lord created the earth or any world  if they leave an exaltation they will have to experience all that we  experience. I see no reason why they should not be tempted  as we are tempted. If we are candidates for exaltation and  glory and we cannot get that exaltation and glory in any other way  then we should be reconciled to it and be satisfied to let the  Lord do with us as he pleases    Is there any evil upon any person or  affliction upon any nation or Kingdom that God does not permit?  There is not. We should then be faithful to God in all things  to be his secret counsellor. if If necessary Why should we complain  or find fault with God about anything? We should not. See  the example of the nations of the earth. They complain  about everything and against all this Providences. There is  no proceeding of ours of act or experience but what he knows  all about.    If it would be any satisfaction to you  I would say that God has passed through all the trials and  experience that we have. Jesus Christ has passed through  all the trials and experience the same as we. It would not  be prudent to say that the Father has not the same  experience that his Son has. He had quite as much  as his Son.    Let the Saints look about themselves and  see if they have as great things as they expected. When  they first received the Gospel and the Holy Ghost opened  their minds they saw that Zion was to be built up and  Israel gathered, the power of God and the Holy Ghost  to be poured out upon us. "If we could get a place by  ourselves how faithful we would live and thank God." Do  you have the same things that you looked for? Well  I dont know you say. This shows that somebody  has let down their watch and influenced others and they 
 have not lived up to their privileges    When we first received the Gospel we were  humble but since then the Tempter has come and we are tempted  with many things. But this is right. The Lord permits  it. We could not get glory without it.    Let me ask if any one is here who  went to Jackson County in 1831? The feeling was if I could  get with the Saints all my sorrow and trouble will be at an end  So it is with the Saints in England. Before we preached the   gathering to them the Lord revealed it to them that they would be  gathered. We told them not to reveal it till the time came.    Do you have anything now that you looked  for in the beginning. If not something is the matter. You  don't do right. You dont settle this difficulty or that. But  what is the matter? You are wrong yourself. What  hinders you from praying all day or having fasting and   prayer? You have enough to eat; but the great  difficulty is when they moved to Zion they brought themselves  with them.    You had so many devil in you that  they trouble you. When the devil and wicked men  have afflicted and persecuted us as far as was for our  good then the Lord says stop and go no farther. But  if we take everything patiently all our afflictions will work  together for our good. But do you at the present  time have anything to mar your peace except what you  bring upon yourselves. You have privileges here but  do the people prize their privileges?    Why do the people go to the Kanyons  after wood on Sunday? Why have they gone to day?  Why dont I do it? Why do I not visit my farm  or the bath house on Sunday? Because it is not right  and sets a bad example. I cannot do these things 
 on the Sabbath.    Some will take poles from his neighbours fence or  take a chain or an axe without liberty. This is wrong. There  is nothing on earth to mar our peace but our own acts. But  the great difficulty is we cannot get away from ourselves. Some  think perhaps that if they go to the Gold digings they can get  away from themselves but they cannot.    When persecution and trials come they scorch  the good seed and it dries up.    How are you going to get Zion. Nothing  hinders our having Zions but ourselves. We have all the  priveleges of angels to worship God and get all blessings we  need.    We have to war with all devils temptations and  trials until we overcome. I will fight until I overcome  If I fall into the grave there are others who will take my  place. There are many who will fight and if needs  to will take the Sword.    I hope all who want good principles will  have the privilege of receiving them. To day is a day of  tithing and sacrafice; to morrow comething the burning.    I would say that you cannot be  perfect without me nor I without you. The Providences  of God have so interwoven and identified the interest of the  children of Adam together that they cannot be perfect  without each other.    Do you enjoy yourselves and have peace. I  have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do  not have peace and no man can take it from me. If you do  not have peace it is because you drive stakes and the Lord  will not let you do it.    But let the will of God be done. If  you dont enjoy Zion it is because you dont say "Let the  will of God be done. There is nothing to take your Zion 
 away but yourselves.    We are to be tried and tempted in every way in order  to prove ourselves the friend of God in all things and God will bless you  My prayer is that God may bless this people and that they may be  faithful and the friends of God.    I told the Legislature that I should  be proud to have the world know that I told the Assembly to  fast and pray until they got the Spirit of God to do their duty  I would like to see the judges upon the Bench to ask God to  bless them and all the Jury and witnesses to assist them in all  their testimony and decisions."    On the 1st of March I was 45 years  of age.    On the 4th the Governor President of the Council  Speaker of the House with all the members of both branches  of the Legislature assembled with their ladies at the Council  House and partook of an excellent feast. The Governor  gave an interesting address in the evening which closed  with the shout of hosannah.    Two days later and the Legislative  Assembly adjourned until the next December and the  Governor blessed the Assembly.    On the 1st of April I attended a party  at the Bath House. About 51 gentlemen and 100 ladies  were present. I addressed the Assembly at 8 o'clock in the evening  and returned home. The Presidency and Twelve and those  who had been at work in the Council House assisting in the  endowments were washed and anoited. I did not get  word of it and was not present.    This evening the mail arrived which   had been anxiously looked for during many weeks. From it  we gathered American and European news and found that there 
 were warm times in Congress in consequence of the Utah Judges  having gone home and made reports against Governor Young and others.    General Conference.  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  held  In the Tabernacle Great Salt Lake City  April 6 1852    There were present Brigham Young H. C. Kimball and  Willard Richards of the First Presidency; and Orson Pratt  Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith of the quorum of the  Twelve. Also Patriarchs John Smith and Isaac Morley,  Daniel Spencer President of the Stake the Presidents of the several guorums and a congregation that filled the Tabernacle  to overflowing. Hundreds could not get into the house.    The President took the Stand at 10 o'clock  and said    "We adjourned last conference to meet in the  Tabernacle to day. We are here in the New Tabernacle  according to appointment."    The hymn was then sung — "Lord in  the morning thou shalt hear"    The dedication prayer was offered up  by Willard Richards and is published in the Deseret News  President Young arose and said    I arise to say a few words, as we   have offered the "Dedication Prayer", upon that subject    Who could foresee the way of the Lord 
 April: 1852.    as we now see it? We can now behold the manifestation  of the Lord. He has done what we could not but we  have an experience that teaches us to trust in the Lord.    We should not undertake to dictate the  Lord for his work will go on. We have seen plenty  try to dictate the Lord and tray to build up themselves  and not this kingdom; but they soon fall and the Lord  overthrows them; but this work goes on the Gospel is  preached and all his work rolls forth.    Let the wicked do what they please:  we have the privelege of worshiping God and being happy  I wish to dedicate all I possess unto God and praise him  and do all he requires of me.    At the last Conference I was sick  and not able to be with you — not able to be up. I  meditated upon the State of the Church. I saw some  going to the right and some to the left: some after gold and  the riches of this life. I said I would tell the brethren  my feelings. I said I would go to work and build a  tabernacle and worship the Lord so that we would not  be driven home by a storm. I saw also that some  would say I cannot go for I must take care of my  cattle my farm my fields &c; but I said I would go and  worship God as long as I wished if the whole earth sunk.    Some delight in a fine horse farm  or house or good things of this life; but this is nothing to  you. It is good in its place. But you cannot  pray because you cannot spend time.    Some women cannot spend time to  have prayers. You know it is your duty to pray and  dedicate yourselves to God and your family and all you  possess.    Some feel as though they must go to 
 April 1852.    night to the Kanyons; but if you will hearken to counsel you will   say to all the world stand by: I am going to worship the Lord. Let  the dead bury the dead; but I will dedicate myself and aff family  and all I have unto the Lord. No matter what the Lord  sets you about go at it and do it.    There is a great change with this people  We have been sick; now are we well: We have been poor, now  are we rich, have been distressed and mobed now we have peace.  How long will it last? As long as this people do right.    It havs been 22 years since this Church  was organized. We should serve the Lord, love the Lord  with all our hearts cease to do wrong or find fault with any  of the Saints. If they do wrong chastise them and not  hate them.    Are the people prepared to make a covenant  to dedicate themselves and their hearts to God from this hour?  I feel to urge all the brethren and sisters to dedicate themselves  unto the Lord.    If we can gain the victory and say I will  do the work of the Lord in all things; if he will make  his will known I will perform it. Not only say but  perform it and dedicate our affections unto the Lord.    We may find some that cannot do this  They say I want some gold or something to help myself  with to get out of difficulties. What will be done in  such a case? I will tell you what I would do.  If I had got but one cow and she plagued me I would  give her away. If you have anything that is in your   way give it to the public works.    Let nothing get between you and God  and I will tell you what to do. If anything gets  between you and God give it to his service or you  cannot get through the gates of the celestial city. 
 Why are you not as poor ^pure^ an the Church of Enoch?  Because you have not the mind to be. I will make my  hands do the will of God and my heart will go with it. The  spirit of envy will not obey. Then unite your interest  with this kingdom for this kingdom will stand forever.  Put your interest with it so that you cannot get away and  then you will stick to the kingdom; but if your purse  of gold is in your pocket and you apostatize you may  go away but if your interest is with the church and you  do wrong you may stay until you get the Spirit of  God again and may be saved.    We must build up this kingdom first  and dont be afraid of storming for this kingdom will be  an everlasting kingdom that will not be thrown down  It will stand forever. The more the wicked try to  throw it down the more it will stand. If you  want it to stand unite your interest with it in such  a manner that you cannot get it away. Then you are  safe.    If I was to ask what was your opinion  concerning the Millinnium I should get a great many  opinions; but the truth is all will be in one sense as it is  now. You will eat built and do all things as now  only you will be more pure and united and all will serve  the Lord and not the devil any more. Let this people  possess this spirit and here would be the Millinnuim  as it would be with any people who will do this."    President Young closed with blessing the  people and after singing and prayer the meeting [a]djourned.    In the afternoon the Tabernacle was  crowded to excess. Orson Pratt and Orson Spencer  delivered discourses.    Next morning the Tabernacle was 
 at an early hour filled to overflowing and in the morning of this day's  Conference the authorities of the church were presented. Among  the rest H. C. Kimball moved that Brigham Young be the Governor  of the State of Deseret which was carried unaminously; and  that Heber C. Kimball be the Lieut. Governor which was  sustained with applause.    President Young remarked that "no doubt  before you get home you will hear we have committed treason.    "With regard to the labour of this Tabernacle  I will say the cost will be read before the meeting and all the  tithing and outlay; but you feel that your expectations  are realized you should be satisfied.    I will say I never saw any room as  convenient as this. It will seat 2,200 persons and these  is are 2,500 persons here to day. I expect the Tabernacle  that we intend to build on this block will seat 15000  people. We never did build a house large enough to  hold the people. If we were to enclose this whole 10  acre block so that it would hold two hundred thousand  people by the time we go[t] it done there would be enough  to fill it.    "The Lord is controling our affairs and does  more for us than we can do for ourselves or ask him to do for  us. The more we are humble and will labour and  prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster they will gather.    "The establishment of this Tabernacle was  the result of my meditation while on a sick bed.    "I feel as usual to praise the Lord with all my   heart. The hand of God has been as visible in leading  this people as it was in leading Israel in the days of Moses  Some had not faith to come on for fear of starving to death. 
 April 1852    Brother Kempton spoke for a few moments and then  again President Young spoke and observed    "The Gentiles will take exception to what is  said here. I know as the Lord lives that the people of  the United States have departed from the Spirit and letter of their  Constitution and this people will be the only people who will  sustain it."    Wm W. Phelps in an address remarked  that this was the third time he had been to a "dedication  of a house built to worship God in. He was at Kirtland  when the angel of the Lord came in and sat there during  service.    "In the afternoon the manifesto of the  recepts and expenditures of the tithing from Oct 1848 to  March 27th 1852 was laid before the Conference. The  sum total of the numerous items stood as follows:    Total of all $353,765.69  Yet to be accounted for 36,495 12  Property on hand 75,550 04    President Young remarked  "For my own satisfaction and great  consolation there has not one dollar gone into the hands of a  lawyer as in the days of Joseph At that time almost  every dollar had to go into the hands of lawyers and they  pro^se^cuted him all the day long. But I said I  would kill any man who sought to take me.    Many thought my purse reached  from eternity to eternity — that there was no end to it  We were called "bogus makers." Brother Kimball  said we would go where we could coin the pure gold  $10 at a lick. We have done so even $20 at a  time. 
 April 1852    Our brethren went to Calafornia. The hand of God  was in all this. They opened the gold mines and the Lord  had a design in it to see who would be tried by it. Never  did nor ever will any of the Saints go to dig gold there without  being sent without being damned by it. Mark my words.  If we go on to the devils ground we shall be left to smell  hell: we shall feel the wrath of God. If I was sent there  by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called me  to go. Many Elders in Israel some good men  have tried it and smutted themselves up so that it is  quite a question if they will ever be washed clean.    I have said I did not think that there  was one dollar in 20 paid in tithing that had been spent  on the Public Works but it seems from the Books that there  has been about one fourth. The other 3 fourths I   have had to borrow. If I had to borrow all the monies  that is used and none assist me to pay it, it will make my  head ache.    I have trusted the Lord and served  him all the day long and when I undertake anything I   persevere until I accomplish it. I see the difference  in trusting in God and doing business according to the  order of the world.    There is not one hair droped from  my head unnoticed and does God not know what I want.    There never was a miracle only to the ignorant  It is all to be accounted for on natural principles. The  Lord will not turn wa stone and clay into gold to suit me  There is enough without it. Jesus did not make  bread out of a stone; but he had knowledge and power  and did call together the elements to make bread and  the elements into the water to make wine. ^out^ But  the Lord is not going to work a miracle to clothe us 
 Raise your wool and flax and spin and weave it and make it up  and not have to pay cash for every pound you use. What you  buy is hardly worth making up but what you make is strong  and will wear."    In the evening the Priesthood filled the  Tabernacle at an early hour and was addressed by President  Brigham Young. He arose and said:    "This is certainly a mixed congregation  of all the officers of the Church. We are to be instructed  in all things. The knowledge that is now in the midst of  this people is more than in all the world besides. All  science is in the midst of this people even if they have not learned  it as the world has.    I have my cogitations and views of the  affairs of this Kingdom; but I have learned that we must  work to the scribe if not we may fail in it; but if we  work in faith and confidence the Lord is apt to help us.    I asked a favour of the Bishops to  divide the money debts in each ward that it might be paid.    Let us contend with ourselves and dicipline  ourselves until everything within us is brought into subjection  to the law of Christ. You have been taught the first  principles of the Gospel now teach yourselves and the Church.    Our school is the School of the Prophets  This is a school to paline and polish ourselves. And  suppose under such privilege we should indulge in evil  and neglect our families and our duty to God? All  our former sins would be upon our Heads.    It is for a man to commit himself  and all that he presides over unto God to do his will   and to continue to do it until he is santified.    If your neighbour does you evil, do  not do evil to him. Bear with him and set him 
 right but dont quarrel with him; but be careful that you conduct yourself  well until you are prepared for the society of holy men.    This is as I said the school of the Prophets  Our baptism is only the beginning of our work. You must  then go on the perfection. You must perform this work. Our  children understand the Gospel but do they understand the way  to govern their lives? We shall never see a day but what   we can learn. We shall not inherit the glory of God all  at once or understand all knowledge; but God teaches us  small principles to prepare us for greater ones.    Let us learn in this school. There are  a great many books of education of the present day. The main  branch of our study is theology. I understand it better than  any in the world. Adam Enoch Moses Aaron Jesus  and the Apostles have all been in the same school in their day  and have faithfully learned that they might be perfected. They  are my brethren and will be my company; and I now tell  you if you want me to have full fellowship with you cease  speaking evil of God and all good men whether in heaven  or earth.    When a man is in the right track he will  come and lay down anything at the feet of a brother to settle  a difficulty and rather wrong themselves himself than have a difficulty out.    If you wanted revelation written diging gold  going to England or any other place. I profess to be an  Apostle. Every Apostle will have to be a revelator and  have revelations if there are thousands of them if they do their  duty and live up to their calling if not they will have to be  removed. But a man who is not an Apostle has  not power to stand at the head of the Kingdom of God,  hold the Keys of the Priesthood and build up and lead  the Church of God. The highest authority on the earth 
 is our Apostle.    Jesus Christ will have a class of men who will do all  that he requires of them. They will have the greater glory; but  those who cannot endure will have a lesser glory."    George A. Smith delivered a discourse after the  president had closed.    Next day the Tabernacle was filled at 9 o'clock  and the meeting opened by prayer from Elder Wilford Woodruff who  then addressed the assembly. He was followed by Orson Spencer Judge Z. Snow and W. W. Phelps and then President  Young made the following remarks.    "The subject I am at is to enlighten  the mind. It is expected we have to learn letters  With regard to the principle of education it commences  with the mother. I do not like to see mothers  attend to everything else but their children. They should  teach their children all they can for early impassions  will last persons during their lives whether they be   good or bad. I will tell  you the truth as it is  in eternity. If the child does not have good  instruction in early life it will be requird at the hand  of the mother and not at the hand of the father.    The child will think the mother is  the best woman on earth and the mother has power to   instill into the mind of the child what she please and what  she imparts unto ^it^ them will stay with them ^it^ through life.    Mothers should take care of their children  and not spend their time watching their husbands. It is  the duty of mothers to stay at home and take care of  their children. My duty calls me to be in the stand  I know not what my children are about or what they  are doing. They may be in the street swearing for  what I know as others do. If they should go to hell 
 it would be required at the hands of the mother and not at my hands  A child of mine shall not conquer me. I would sooner see them  die than that they should conquer me. If any one of my  children will not follow my footsteps I will disinherit or disown  them. They shall not have part in my kingdom. I   would rather get children adopted to me who would keep the  commandments.    No child should rise up and teach and control  the mother; nor should woman rise up and dictate the  husband and the husband should not rise up and try to dictate  his president or the Lord.    Education begins with the mother to the  child. You must keep it in remembrance that the Lord  has commanded you to multiply and replenish the earth  that you may have joy and rejoicing in the day of the holy  resurrection.    Do you keep your minds pure and do  you pray night and day. Now pray from the time of  conception till the time of delivery that your child may be  filled with the Holy Ghost and that a noble spirit from eternity  may come into the Tabernacle and that the Holy Ghost may  rest upon the father mother and child.    When some speak you cannot understand  they make use of such high flown words; but when I speak  you can understand the verity in the English language.    I would like to be with the Holy Ones who   are full of eternal light. A point of the finger or emotion   would communicate without words. When I am full of  the Holy Ghost I can see a man as well behind as  before. I can see their hearts by the Spirit of  God and know what is in them."    In the afternoon one hundred were  called for to go with their teams to meet the emigrants 
 and some were appointed to go on foreign missions:    Thomas Margetts to Italy, T. B. Broderick  John Dalley and John Armstrong to England; George Parman to  the nations Wm Fatheringham to Calcutta Edward Stephenson to  Giberalter James Dilley and two others to Scotland and Alfred  Smith for foreign mission.    The Seventies held a meeting at night  on the subject of building the Seventies Hall, and they were  addressed by Joseph Young George A Smith Wilford  Woodruff and others.    Synopsis of An Address  by  President Young  April the 9th.    "This people are blessed with all that heart can with and  yet many are not satisfied. This is the case with some  spirits and they want things illegally.    It is not necessary that we should have  a Temple. It is absolutely necessary that we should have  a Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle  is to assemble the multitude for meeting but a Temple is to  gather the Priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord.    Are we prepared to go and redeem our  dead? Is there a place prepared that we may go and  redeem our dead? No there is not. We give endowments  here but it is like trying to step on to the top round first    If we had the privelege of building  a temple our works would not be legal but we do these things  until we have time to build a temple. If we had gone on  to the top of the mountains if we had no room it would be   legal and right. 
 Brother Kimball says we have to make our own  heaven. The Lord cannot save us if we do not save ourselves. If  we expect to get our endowments we have got to follow the footsteps  that God has set for us to walk in and if we walk in that channel  God owns our labours and acknowledges all that is done.    Now all the ordinances will have to be attended to  again when we get a Temple. Yet if any one dies in faith those  ordinances will be legal; but all that live will have to do it again  and I will say as a revelation that if you will not help build a   Temple and have faith in the work you will be lost.    A word to those who have got their endowments  We shall work as fast as we can and what we have done is  legal. If we had been in our own lands and had a right to  a temple we should not do as we now do.    Many have died in the faith, have been  worn out: their ordinances are legal. Those who came into  the church first and are faithful have a right to the ordinances  first.    I wish the people to understand that when the  Lord has anything for them they will have it; but when the  Lord has nothing for the people I don't want for them to teaze  me for what they cannot have. When there is to be a work  done I will tell you.    Now we shall begin to build a temple in   1853. This Tabernacle will have to accomodate the   people until the Temple is built. If this wont answer for  the people until we build a Temple we will make a Bowery  on the North and South sides of the block.    At soon as the Temple is built we will  give you your endowments. If there are any who were in  Jackson County and other places and have helped to build up  the Kindom of God in the early days we want to bless them  first; and if there is any man or child who went in the Battalion 
 or Pioneers come forward and get your blessings before others and  we will bless you. If you are faithful there is no blessing  in the celestial law or kingdom of God but what you will  get.    I want to be sealed to my father before I  shall be a legal heir. If I were to die and there was  not a child of mine to live to do it for me some friend  would be raised up to do it and if not my body will  soon be raise up and I should be in some Temple with  my brothren to tell them what to do.    I can see the hearts of men and   the spirits of men. If they do try to be hid I can  see them. I see many who aspire to be first and  to be exalted above their fellows; but I can tell  you all you will be rewarded according to what you do  whether you do little or much or nothing at all.    Some wish to be above Brother  Brigham. Why was I not called before brother Joseph  Why does not some one ask the Lord to appoint them to  be above brother Brigham? But the Lord will laugh  at you. Such forget the Kingdom of God. They are corrupt.    Let every man say what can I do  to build up the Kingdom of God. Ask the mother who  is trying to do the will of God what her reward will be?  She will say I dont know but I will say if you are  faithful and satisfied with your condition in this life you  will be blessed and satisfied with your condition in the   world to come.    Let all strive to be satisfied with their  conditions in life and that will be a blessing to them."    Other matters concerning paying our  debts &c were touched upon by the President and then Elder  John Banks followed in some interesting remarks. 
 After several others had spoken the meeting adjourned  In the afternoon of this day's conference President Young delivered his  great discourse on Adam our Father and God. I recorded a synopsis  of it in my journal but a full report of it is published in the Journal  of Discourses Vol I.    The Conference continued until the close of  Sunday the 11th.    On the last day after an address from Heber  C. Kimball who remarked that Bishop Hunter was Chief Bishop  and had the right to choose his two councillors the Presiding  Bishop arose and said he should choose men who could assist.  Brigham Young was at the head and his councillors were inspired  of the Holy Ghost." I select for my councillors Brigham Young  and Heber C. Kimball."    Then Brother Heber C. FKimball and   Willard Richards laid hands upon Bishop Hunter's head and  blessed him and said ^H C Kimball said^    "O God the Eternal Father I ask in the name  of Jesus Christ while we lay our hands upon they head ^the head of thy servant^ that all  our words may be dictated by the Holy Ghost while we set  apart brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop. We hereby set  you apart to be a presiding Bishop and to be a judge in   Israel. We bless you with the Spirit of your office and   calling. You shall have wisdom to judge between good  and evil in all things and to be a great benefit to the house  of Israel and that they may uphold thee by their faith that  thou mayest administer in faith and righteousness and be a   great blessing to the people and administer to the poor and needy  Thou shalt have discernment like the lightning to detect the   evil and those who seek to deceive and that all may receive thy  teachings and thy work may work together for the good of all  the people: even so Amen."    ^Of^ To Brother Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball 
 said:    "You should be blessed and all your house and not one of them  shall be last and no man shall get between me and Brother Brigham  and Brother Richards and no man or woman shall get between the  Twelve and Presidency: if they do they will get pinched and  any man or woman who tried to get between us will be damned  They tried to prejudice Joseph against us in his day and they will be  damned.    "The Twelve are the best men that live and any  man who tries to put their feet upon their neck will get the  feet of the Twelve upon their own neck."    President Young came in at this moment and brother  Heber continued    "Do as brother Brigham tells you and all will  be right and you will not have sorrow. Follow my counsel  and you will not have sorrow. If my family would take  my counsel and had faith in me I would never have a  doctor in my family for ^but^ I have doctors here that I have faith  in but lLet me send for a doctor and they have faith in him  and not in me and then what further am I."    Brother Brigham observed, "That is true  and worthy of note."    "If you are not one you are not mine saith  the Lord; but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruit  to the glory of God. When we learn this lesson our sorrows  will cease. When we get the clock off we shall be in heaven  In this house is my heaven for I am in a heavenly place  with holy men and angels." x x x x x x x x    The old lion's neck is out of the yoke and  they will not put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip  them out and they shall not whip him out nor me nor my   breathren. You shall be blessed and the earth shall bring  forth for your good and you shall be blessed in your posterity 
 and I say it in the name of Jesus Christ"    President Young said the words of brother Kimball  was a prophecy and was true.    The Conference was adjourned until the Special Conference  in August of the same year.    On the 23rd of April I left the City to accompany  the Presidency on a visit to the Southern Settlements and to explore as  far as we had an opportunity.    We visited various cities and places on the way  and reached Filmore City May the 2nd.    Next day we held a meeting at Filmore and  President Young preached. I reported the sermon and have it in  manuscript.    On the following day fifteen mounted men armed and  equipt with provisions left us in the morning to go on an exploring  tour after lead and silver. Bro Major our artist took the  likeness of an Indian Chief.    Next day the brethren overtook us with the  Eastern mail and we had much rejoicing with the abundant  news we obtained.    On the 7th we drove into Parowan and  the next day the people held a meeting in the Council House  of which I took the minutes and on the Sunday Orson Pratt  preached in the morning and Presidents Young and Kimball  in the afternoon the discourses of whom I reported.    On the Monday we rode to Ceder City  and President Young addressed the people and the proceedings  of the meeting I reported.    We also held a meeting the next day  I preached to the people and was followed by Orson Pratt  Heber C. Kimball and President Young. The Iron Company  was also organized. In the evening we took a walk on  the hill and viewed the country around. 
 May    The Rodeometer made the distance from Great  Salt Lake City via San Pete to Cedar Fort 314 1/2 miles.    We met on the 14th to organize the High Council and  Presidency of the Stake &c at Parawan having returned there that  morning. John L. Smith was approinted President of the Stake  John Steel 1st Councillor and Henry Lunt 2nd Councillor  E. H. Groves, M. Cruthers R. Harmns, Joseph Chatterly  J Graham James A Little Wm H Dame.

The whole of these were ordained under the  hands of Elders Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  making 10 High Priests 12 High Councillors 1 President of the Stake  with his two Councillors.    We left Parowan the next day and  two days afterwards wasere at Filmore where we stayed over the  Sunday.    I entered a city lot in Filmore which was then the  Capitol of the Territory and I also got one entered for George  A. Smith and Orson Pratt.    Returning home at Spanish Fork I  entered 160 acres for a farm.    We rode to Provo on the 20th and through  Utah Valley to the foot of the mountain and camped  and the next day May the 21st we arrived at Great Salt  Lake City and were welcomed by the citizens.    July the 4th came on a Sunday this year. The interval from our return from our Southern  trip had been spent in the daily affairs of life and now  the Celebration of Indipendance day was suspended till the  Monday when the Governor and escort were escorted to  the Tabernacle by the Mormon Battalion Silver Greys 
 Horse Companies &c and the day spent as usual in celebrating the day  of American Indipendence.    The 24th of July in commemoration of the  enterence of the Pioneers into the Valley was also spendidly celebrated  by the citizens.    On Sunday the 25th Orson Pratt delivered this  sermon on the death and resurrection of the heavens earth and man  and I baptized my daughter Susan C. Woodruff and Mary Webster  and confirmed them.    On the 28th the Eastern mail came in and I was  with the Twelve and Presidency until midnight hearing the news  and the next day the California mail arrived and the day  following Charles C. Rich left us for San Barnadino    In the evening of Sunday Aug. 14 Alfred  Smith addressed the Saints upon the claims of Gladden Bishop  who for many years had been trying to gather a company  around him as many other foolish men and false teachers of  the Churh had done. After the close of Smith's speech  President Young made a few remark and Alfred Smith  and his wife and another person who held their sentiments  were cut off from the Church.    On the 20th I attended a great feast  at South Cottenwood. President Young was taken quite  sick so he could not be present. There were gathere  on the occasion Brother Kimball and Orson Pratt and Wilford  Woodruff of the Twelve Bishop Hunter Wm W. Phelps and a  great collection of people. Speeches were made by Elders  Kimball Pratt Woodruff Phelps Bishop Hunter and others.  On this day also 4 of the Twelve Apostles returned  from their missions—namely John Taylor from France  E. T. Benson from Pottawatamie County Erastus Snow from  Scandinavia and Franklin D. Richards from the British  Mission over which he had been presiding. 
 Next day I met in Council with the Presidency and  six of the Twelve and it was good to see so many of my quorum together  again.    The Snake Indians came into the city to day to make  a treaty of peace with the Utahs and Walkers tribe. They had been  at war for many years but through the wise course of President  Young they were brought to peace.    Special Conference  August 28th 1852    The Special Conference assembled this morning  to appoint Elders to foreign missions. One hundred were  appointed to Europe and almost all the world. I took  minutes of the Conference. We had a good time and   the Spirit and power of God rested with the people. The  Conference closed on the evening of the Sunday the 29th.    Sunday September the 12th Orson Pratt preached  the funeral sermon of Lorenzo D. Barnes and Wm Burton  both of whom had died in England but whose bodies had been  disintered and brought to Great Salt Lake City.    The mail came in on the 20th. Bro  Joseph Russell of Marimichi had also arrived a few days previous  and had been staying with me. Orson Hyde too had returned  to the Valley.    General Conference  of   The Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S.  Oct 6 1852    The General Conference of the Church assembled in the new 
 Tabernacle and proceeded to the business of the day. It continued five  days closing on Sunday night the 10th. It was a very interesting  Conference a glorious time and the Spirit of God rested upon the people  and the Elders. On the Sunday night I went with the Twelve  to bless the Elders who were going on foreign missions and the  spirit of prophecy rested upon us while we were laying our hands  upon them.    On the 16th I met a company of Elders at the   Council House and spent the whole day in teaching and blessing  45 Elders who were going to the various nation of the earth  ^China &c see^ Brother Joseph Young and J. M. Grant assisted in blessing  the Elders. The Spirit and power of God rested upon us in  a great degree the heavens were opened unto us and our minds were  filled with visions revelations and prophecy while we sealed great  blessings upon the heads of the Elders as we were moved upon by  the Holy Ghost. We foretold to them what would befall them  by sea and by land and that they would do a great work and gather  many Saints and much wealth to Zion.    On Sunday the 21st of November Parley P.  Pratt preached his great sermon on the Everlatsting Covenant made  to Abraham.    Dec. 13th the Legislative Assembly of the  Territory of Utah met in the Council House at 10 o'clock and  was organized by appointing J. M. Grant Speaker and Thomas  Bullock clerk. The Council was organized by appointing  Willard Richards President and James Ferguson clerk. Wilford  Woodruff E. T. Benson and Lorenzo Snow of the Twelve were members  of the House and Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt George A Smith  and F. D. Richards of the Twelve were in the Council.    December the 22nd the quorum of the   Twelve met in the upper room of the Council House at 6 o'clock  in the evening. There were present eleven of the Twelve  Apostles. The abssent member of our quorum was 
 return from the four corners of the earth to again sit in council together  in Zion.    Erastus Snow followed. He had known the quorum of the  Twelve from the beginning since they were first together in his father's house  since his absence to Denmark on mission he had learnt how to appreciate  the society of home and his brethren, &c.    Orson Hyde said we were at liberty to prophesy while  together as moved upon by the Holy Ghost and if we did not feel to  prophesy to speak by faith and it should be fulfilled. He had unlimited  confidence in every member of the Twelve and the Presidency and  prophesied in the name of God that we should all meet and  come forth in the first resurrection and receive our crowns in  the celestial Kingdom" which was confirmed by a good Amen  by all the quorum.    John Taylor next spoke and referred to the changes  among the nations and said that the ^day^ was near when Kings would   seek counsel at our hands. "In the beginning the Elders  went out ignorant men now they are full of intelligence  and the nations of the earth will feel their influence."  George A. Smith was delighted with the  occasion and rejoiced to see the union of the quorum and their  dispositions to do right. " We dont have to feel that Lyman  Wight is drawing off one way John E. Page another and Wm  Smith committing iniqiuty and we forced to sustain them  against our feelings. I have the satisfaction of believing  that each member of the quorum was is doing right and I  rejoice that the quorum have been able to publish the Gospel  in six different languages and to gather the people together. He  hoped we should meet once a week and with the Presidents  offer our Prayers; felt a proud satisfaction in being associated  with 10 men whom he believed ^possessed^ the most intelligence of any  men upon the earth and believed the prophesies of that evening  would be fulfilled. He closed with his blessing upon us. 
 Among other remarks Amasa Lyman said He had  found out what that love and affection for his brethren is that surpasses  the love of woman for he had a confidence in his quroum far greater  than in his wives and children, for his brethren had been brought up  in the hard school of experience and had been tried in all things and  proven true and I have been proven with them. I am wedded to  my quorum with all my interest. I go when I am sent and come  when I am called and so expect to continue to do. My interest  is inseperatelybelly connectd with this Kingdom and I trust ever will  be through time and eternity.    C. C. Rich expressed his feelings and said, "on  my way home I had a dream. I thought the ancients in their  resurrected bodies were associated with us in this place. I have  the most unbounded faith in the quorum of the Twelve and in  the First Presidency. I hope the Winter Season may be  profitable to us in our associations and that we may improve our  our time."    E. T. Benson next spoke and among a member  of remarks said  "If the First Presidency were to be removed the  quorum of the Twelve would have to preside and if they had  not the fulness of the gifts they would not be fit to preside  I feel exceedingly thankful to be associated with such men. I  have not language to express my feelings when I was first  called to be an Apostle in this quorum. I could not sleep  for three days and nights. I feel now as though I could  break a nation to pieces. I felt renovated with the  Holy Spirit while Parley P. Pratt was speaking. No blessing  is too great or too good for us and we shall possess them  all."    Lorenzo Snow said his sentiments  were shadowed forth in his labours. I have great joy  in meeting with you am beholding your faces and contemplating 
 the influence and power of this quorum and the greatness of their work  I anticipate much this Winter in our meetings and in enjoying the  blessing of God. I have rejoiced this night to hear the exalted expressions  of the quorum in rendering thangsgiving to God and not one word  of complaint of hardships inprisonments or afflictions of any kind  but we are filled with hidden joy and peace. I feel determined  to do all that is asigned me that I may be worthy a place in  this quorum. I felt grateful to hear the blessings pronounced  upon us by our President."    He closed with joy and thanksgiving.  Wilford Woodruff next addressed the quorum upon  the importance of their keeping private histories of their  lives labours and ministry and also a joint history of the  quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He said since he had been  a member of the Church he had been inspired not only to write  all his own acts and life but to write the sermons teachings  and prophesies of the Prophet Joseph , President [Brigham Young|Young] and council  and of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted with  their labours. He said each member of the quorum should   keep an account of his own mission works miracles and the   blessings of God unto him and that the history of the Twelve  Apostles could now be easily obtained; but if we omitted  it until we are dead our friends could not get it correctly  before the world.    Parley P. Pratt spoke of the filling up of   the quorum of the Twelve in 1848 and of their commencing a   record of the Twelve Apostles and wished it continued. He  did not know how far and minute we ought to be but  thought we ought to record our official acts and considered it  for our interest as well as a duty thus to do.    E. T. Benson said President Willard Richards wished  him to request the younger members of the quorum to hand  to him a short statement of their lives and ministry to go 
 into the Church History.    George A. Smith Wilford Woodruff and Parley P  Pratt interchanged a few words upon the subject of Journal keeping.    Franklin D. Richards next spoke and said I feel  behind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so much  teaching and counsel from brother Joseph as they have. When I  contemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour is equal   to the noblest ambition which man could entertain both in this  world and the next. He felt his joy tempered in the recolection.    Orson Hyde said:    "While I have been listening I have  had an unusual train of reflection. Of necessity we shall  soon be called again to seperate and the Kingdoms of this world  must become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. We  are trained in the school of experience. I may live to see you   all in different parts of the earth and while the Kingdoms of  the earth are falling you will in many instances be enable  to streahch out your hands and give counsel and save many  people and be enabled to rule governments and thus fulfill the  prophecies. Many of these things are not afar off. All  is eternity to us whether this or the other side of the veil  We are born in eternity and let us be where we will it will  be our calling to win souls unto Christ. The Presidency  are unwell or they would be here. I wish the Journals  of the Twelve to be written up so that they can be on hand  when needed to be published. I wish each one of the   quorum to write as good an epistle as he can and have  the whole put in a book form and sent forth into the world."    Parley P. Pratt thought the subject abounded  in us. "We owe the world a testimony not as individuals  but as a quorum of the Twelve Apostles."    He suggested that each should contribute  an epistle and from the whole compile and embody a book 
 to go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined "History  of the Twelve Apostles    George A. Smith thought it very important that  an authentic history of each member should be preserved.    Wilford Woodruff mentioned certain items which he  considered necessary in the preservation of our history. He lamented  that David W. Patten had not left any record of his life for he was a  Prophet and an Apostle and a mighty man. Many miracles were  wrought by him. He told a rich man in Tennessee who fought  the work of God that he and his family should beg their bread. Robert  C. Petty saw that same man cry at a blaksmith's shop because  he could not get trusted to have his plough sharpened."    President Orson Hyde moved that Wilford Woodruff  be the clerk and historian of the Twelve Apostles. Carried  unanimously.    P. P. Pratt proposed a new reord and wished that  the Narative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recorded  in it beginning with the President and going through with each  member in order as he stands in the quorum.    W. Woodruff said he was willing to serve the  quorum as its historian as faithfully as he could through it would  be a heavy tax on his time.    Erastus Snow enquired if the History  contemplated is to be confined to the present quorum or the members  from the beginning.    Parley P. Pratt throught it should merely include  the present quorum.    Erastus Snow would like to see included all  that could be found of David W. Patten.    Charles C. Rich observed that the morning of  the day when David Patten was martyred he said the Kingdom  of God should be delivered or he should lay down his life    Parley P. Pratt wished brother Woodruff 
 to leave all temporal business as much as possible and bring this  History up.    A. Lyman said there was no date of his ordination.    Orson Hyde proposed for the Twelve to meet with  the Presidency and also to meet each week for a mutual exchange  of thought.    We then adjourned to meet at the same place one week from that date.    On the 29 of Dec the quorum of the Twelve  met and spent the evening upon conversation upon some plan for  liberating ourselves and families so that we could be foot-loose  to go and preach the Gospel.    On the last day of Dec 1852 I looked over  my Journal and made up the following    Synopsis  of  The Journal of Wilford Woodruff  for 1852    Travels: I travelled with President Brigham Young Heber  C. Kimball and a large company of Elders through  the Southern part of Utah Territory visiting the cities  villages and settlements on the way teaching and instructing  the people. Our Southern visit extended as far South  as Parowan and Ceder cities making a distance to and from  of eight hundred and seventy six miles.    Public Meetings: I attended forty five.

Marriages: I married three coupl    History of the Twelve: I was appointed clerk and  Historian of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 
 1853    I wrote in my Journal at the time    My Reflections on the New Year.    A new year in the midst of a new era! Oh how  time flies and how great how important how magnificent are the   events broorne on its wings. It is the opening of a dispensation  that swallows up all other dispensations since the world began  The deeds of the last thousand years sink into insignificence in  comparison to the work of the present time.    The heavens gaze upon the scenes as  they pass with deep interest while the whole earth behold the  scenes in wonder and amazement. The ancient Prophets saw  by vision and revelation the scenes which were to follow each  other in quick succession in this age in the establishment of the  great Kingdom of God to be thrown down no more forever. The  little stone cut out of the mountain without hands which was to  roll forth until it became a mountain and filled the whole earth 
 1853  breaking in pieces and subduing all other kingdoms and itself to stand forever  as seen by the Prophet David has commenced its work.    That Church and Kingdom of God is now on the   earth and is being established and must endure. The world are gazing  upon it, located in these valleys of the mountains like a City set upon   a hill which cannot be hid.  Its first Prophet and founder has laid  down his life in its defence. He has been martyred and his blood  is crying from the ground for vengeance upon a great nation. Many  others have fallen martyrs to the truth and the Gospel of Jesus Christ  since the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ in A. D. 1830  and many more may; yet the Church is bound to rise and prosper  until the Zion and Kingdom of our God shall stand forth in bold  relief with all that power might majesty and dominion which God  has declared concerning her and which has been spoken through the  mouths of his holy Prophets since the world began.    This Church and Kingdom has continued  steadily to arise since its first organization amid opposition oppression  persecution and martyrdom until it has become established in the midst  of the "everlasting hills" not only gaining strength in Church but   also in State.    Ephraims nobles are of himself and his Governor  has proceeded out of the midst of him. And while truth inspires  my heart shall I feelt to write it? Shall I feer that the   present or future generations may read these truths which are  burning in my breast unkindled by the altars of heaven? No  God forbid! for the voice of truth whispers to me that our Governors  Presidents and Senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God will  be inspired to take bold measures perform daring acts and in their  strength and power stretch forth their strong arm and save them from  annihilation that holy instrument—the Constitution of the United  States which the ^American^ people are about to sell for a mess of pottage  and try to consign it to the grave; but there is a power who   has decreed that liberty freedom and the rights of the meek of the 
 Earth shall not wholly die; and that power is God. He has decreed to  inspire and nerve up the soul the sinew and the arm of his governors  senators and Prophets and own them for the contest and defend them  in their warefare. That nation or Kingdom or tongue or people  from this time forth who shall rise up against Zion—the Church and  Kingdom of God—to oppress her shall be visited by the judgements  of the Most High and be overthrown and brought to desolation  and may God spedily hasten it. May the Almighty begin  this year to rend the Kingdoms of this world with his servants  and continue it until all nations shall acknowledge there is  a God in Israel."    On the 1st day of the new year the Quorum of the   Twelve Apostles met at the Council House at 8 o'clock being eleven  in number: Orson Pratt was absent in Washington.    The quorum marched to President Brigham   Young's and wished him a happy new year. President Young  received them with joy and gladness and after the greetings  were over he asked us what he should treat us towith. The  sentiment was instantaneous in the hearts of all the quorum  and spoken by President Orson Hyde: "Treat us with your  blessing."    Then President Young blessed the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles and said they always had his blessing; and  the Twelve felt and realized that the blessings of the Presidency  of the Church and Kingdom of God was of far more worth and  benefit to them than any earthly gift or the treasures of the  earth and their hearts were full of joy and gladness.    The Twelve left their blessings upon President  Young and his house. While they were paying their respects  to him the band was playing a lively tune in the front of  the house. The quorum saluted the two bands with a  happy new year and received in return some excellent music. 
 The quorum of the Twelve next visited President Heber C.  Kimball and wished him a happy New Year and he also received them  with gladness and gave unto them his blessing which was also highly prized  In his blessing unto them he said his faith and feelings were that no  one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall and no power should  take their crown and Kingdom; but they should come forth in the morning  of the first resurrection and be exalted to glory immortality and eternal  lives. Their blessings should increase from that time hencforth  and forever and they should not want bread but they should have means  to support themselves and families."    The Twelve left their blessings upon President  Kimball and then visited Father John Smith the aged Patriarch of the  Church and wished him a happy new year. He manifested much  joy and satisfaction in seeing eleven of the Twelve Apostles beneath  his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon the Twelve  his blessing and said they should live to see the Kingdom of God  and Zion established to be thrown down no more forever and that  none of them should ever fall but they should have part in the  first resurrection. No power should take their crowns but  they should be blessed in all their labours in the earth and the  blessings of God should increase upon them from that time  forth both temporal and spiritual.    The Apostles also left their blessings upon  the Patriarch and his household and next visited President Willard Richards  who received them in like manner and was saluted by them  with the happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his  blessing. He believed this the beginning of an eventful year  in the history of this Church and that each succeeding one would  be more and more so until the Coming of the Son of Man. He  said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers and  blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the four corners  of the earth. They were men of God and were destined  to perform a great and mighty work upon the earth and they 
 should live till they were satisfied with life and see light and truth prevail  over sin and tradition."    The Twelve then went to the house of Elder P. P. Pratt  and there united with his family in singing the "Return of the Twelve"  and other songs of Zion. The spirit and power of God rested upon   them and their hearts were filled with praise and thanksgiving to  God in all their visits of this the new year of 1853.    The bands continued their salutations throughout  the city and their enliveing music was everywhere received with open  ears and hearts of joy.    Dedication of Social Hall    During the evening the quorum of the Twelve  with the Presidency and about 200 of the Saints met with our families  at the Social Hall and dedicated it to the purpose for which it  was built after which they went forth in the dance finishing  their enjoyments of this new year's day.    Sunday the 2nd Bro Joseph Toronto gave an  account of his travels through Italy and the dangers he ran in  preaching the Gospel to his native country. He was among the  Waldensees.    On the following Sunday after an interesting  discourse ^from P. P. Pratt^ brother Groward gave an interesting account of his  mission on the Western Islands—of his travels among the natives,  his sufferings among them, and the opposition by the French  Government. He was 9 years on his mission and several   years without hearing anything from the Church and his mental  sufferings were very great. The first he received was a letter  I wrote to him and that he did not obtain until two years after  it was written.    On the Sunday Jan 2nd President Brigham  Young and Heber C. Kimball met with the quorum of the Twelve  and the same subject was brought up and talked over as on the 29  of December. President Young said the best way for the Twelve  to get a living for themselves and families was to preach the 
 Gospel with all their might and "your means will come in your way. T.  B. Marsh once said he did not know what Joseph called the Twelve for  unless it was to abuse them and I told him if the Twelve were faithful  they would soon see the day that they would have all the influence  they could weild."    The President Young said laying plans in our present  situation for perpetual cover was all a shadow. We may lay   plans but they may be frustrated."    The Legislature closed its session of the year on the  night of the 21st of January    Sunday 23rd Orson Hyde preached upon the   subject that the hand of God had been in the working out of the events  and changes among the nations to prepare for his work—such as the  reformation of Luther and others God's inspiring Columbus to the  discovery of America the invention of railroads telegraphs &c and in the  revolutions among the nations. Parley P. Pratt and Amasa Lyman  followed both advoating the same views.    On the 26th Mrs Woodruff had a son born but  it only lived two hours. I blessed it before it died and named it  Aphek. I buried it during the day in my garden.    Sunday the 30th Parley P. Pratt preached a  fine discourse upon the subject of the Kingdom of God to be set up  in the last days.    Breaking The Ground For The Temple    Feburary the 14th 1853    This was an important day to the Saints in the Valley  and even in all the world.    The Saints met upon the Temple Block in a   vast body to break the ground for another ^Temple^. The people commenced  gathering at an early hour and at eleven o'clock there were thousands 
 upon the ground. President Young and Council the quorum of the Twelve  and many of the quorums of the Church were there and all the bands of music  in the City were in attendance.    At eleven o'clock President Brigham Young Heber  C. Kimball and Willard Richards got into a buggy inside the square  surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve. President Young then  arose and addressed the assembly upon the subject of building Temples  I recorded it in my journal but it is published in the Journal of Discourses  Vol I[1].    After the address of President Young Heber C. Kimbell  arose and with uplifted hands to heaven offered up a fervant heart:felt  prayer to God imploring his blessing upon President Young and his   Councillors and all the authorities of the Church with the whole house  of Israel. He then dedicated the ground unto God and prayed  for his blessings to attend them in building the Temple and all the  public works in Zion.    At the close of the prayer the Presidency and Twelve  walked to the South East corner of the ground laid out for the Temple  The earth being frozen President Heber C. Kimball commenced breaking  the ground with a pick. Then President Richards did the same  and then Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff John Taylor  Amasa Lymon Charles C. Rich Ezra T. Benson Lorenzo Snow Erastus  Snow and Franklin D. Richards.  Then the gound was broke  and President Brigham Young took out the first turff and while  taking it out a silver dollar from some one in the congregation was  thrown which struck in the hole. Brother Kimball said that  was our omen that we should have plenty of money to build the  Temple with.    Orson Pratt was at this time at Washington and    A Smith at Provo but all the rest of the Twelve were present  at the breaking of the ground for the Temple.    As soon as the turf was taken out the  congregation was dismissed and the people rushed to the hole to get 
 a chance to throw a little dirt out. My father Aphek Woodruff aged 70 years  myself Wilford Woodruff aged 46 and my son Wilford Woodruff aged 12 years  all threw out dirt from the foundation of this important temple.    After leaving the ground in company with the Presidency  and Twelve I went to see the new sugar works operate. I saw the hydraulic  press pressing out the juice. Brother Joseph Russell of Marimichi had  furnished about fifty thousand dollars to purchase the machinery and apperatus  and get it to the Valley to make sugar from the beet.    My children Wilford Phebe and Susan also Emma and   Sarah were all present at the breaking of the ground for the foundation  of the Temple.    On Sunday the 20th President Young delivered a discourse  which I reported and recorded in my journal but it is also published in the  Journal of Discourses Vol I [1] and as at about this date is the commencement  of the publication of the Sermons of the Presidency and Twelve I shall  only transcribe from my daily journal such as may not be found  already published.    I was 46 years of age on the 1st of March 1853    General Conference  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of L D. Saints  held  In Great Salt Lake City  April the 6th 1853    The General Conference commenced this morning and  it was one of the most interesting ever held by the Church since  its organization.    The proceedings of the day was afterwards published  in the Deseret News and copied from thence into the L. D. Saints  Millennial Star and therefore I shall not record it here. I   will say however that the four corner stones of the Temple 
 were laid in Great Salt Lake City on this day    The Presidency laid the South East corner stone  with the Patriarch; Bishop Edward Hunter and Council with the  lesser Priesthood laid the South West Corner stone; John Young  the President of the High Priests Quorum and Council the President  of the Stake and Council with the High Council of laid the North  West corner stone; The Twelve Apostles First Presidency of the   Seventies and Presidency of the Elders quorum laid the North  East corner stone.    There was a prayer offered on each corner  stone and also an oration delivered and a song sung as they  were severally laid.    There were gathered on this occasion the  largest assembly of Saints ever gathered together in Deseret.    The proceedings occupied until 2 o'clock  After the laying of the North East Corner Stone by the Twelve  etc. which closed the ceremony President Young ascended the stone  and gave his benediction as follows.    Brethren and sisters I bless you in the   name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and pray my father in   heaven to encircle you in the arms of his love and mercy  protect us until we have finished the Temple receive the  fulness of our endowments therein and then build many more  And I pray also that we may live to see the great Temple in   Jackson County Missouri. You ano dismissed with  the blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ upon your heads  Amen."    The procession then returned to the Tabernacle   and were dismissed by President Young until 3 o'clock    President Brigham Young delivered a very  interesting discourse in the afternoon which is published. Brother  Kimball said that the Seventies had a portion of all the Apostleship  to had all the Elders but none were ordained to the fulness of 
 the Apostleship except the Twelve or those who are ordained to that office.    Amasa Lyman told a dream. He said that Joseph  came to him and told him to dip a large lake dry and gave him a  spoon to do it with. He said he thought he could have no impression  upon it with a spoon but still he would obey counsel and he went  dipping and soon had lowered the lake five feet. Then Joseph told  him he could not always judge of things by appearances but the  Lord would do all for us that our hearts could desire.    On the 7th the Conference was called to order by   President Young who presented to us a text _ a set of fire irons made by the  brethren from the native iron in Iron County.    Benjamin Clapp arose and made confession that   he had been in darkness and had done wrong in many things. He  desired to be forgiven and retained in the Church. He was forgiven    The authorities of the Church were presented and  sustained.    George A Smith was called upon to preach an iron sermon  He took one of the fire irons made from native iron and swung  it round his head and cried out stereotyped edition and then   descended amidst the cheers of the congregation.    In the afternoon Parley P. Pratt read his oration  delivered on the corner stone of the Temple and also preached his sermon  of that day published in the Deseret News.    After dismissing the meeting the Presidency and  others met in the vestry and James Alread Aschel Perry and  Charles Walker Hyde were ordained Patriarchs under the hands  of Presidents Young Kimball and Richards    The meeting being opened on the following  day President Kimball arose and said we have a number chosen to  go on missions and then 23 names were given and set apart  to their different stations in Europe and five to other parts of the  world. Their names are published in the "News".    President Young afterwards arose and gave a 
 text _ "The Right of Heirship" and preached an important discourse from it  which is published.    On the 10th of April the Conference adjourned to  October 6th 1853 but President Young appointed the 2nd Saturday in August  for a Special Conference to appoint Elders to go abroad.    The President closed with, "And I bless every man  and woman in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen" and then President  Kimball gave the benediction.    May the 2nd President Young returned home  from his Southern visit and the Legion went out and escorted  him into the City; and on the following Sunday President Young  addressed the people upon the subject of his journey South.    There had been at this date considerable  excitement about the Indians and expectations of war with  them.    Sunday the 29 Parley P. Pratt spoke upon   the linage of our fathers and that we should seek to obtain it  and in the afternoon President ^Young^ delivered a powerful discourse rebuking  wickedness with a sharp two edged sword.    The 4th of July was celebrated by the   citizens an account of which is published in the Deseret News of   July 10th.    The 24 of July came on a Sunday and  the Saints celebrated the enterance of the Pioneers into the Valley  by worshiping God in the Tabernacle.    Next day I and my family attended a feast  at Big Cottonwood in honour of the enterance of the Pioneers upon  which I made a Speech.    I received a letter from Dwight Webster saying  that his wife my sister Eunice died on the  My Sister Eunice Died  June the 14th 1853   
 My sister had a long illness and she sent me word that she died a full believer  in Mormonism.    On the 31st of July President Young preached a discourse upon  the subject of our Indian war for we had had a war with Walker and his  band for about three weeks. The Saints were gathering in out of the  small settlements and fortifying themselves.  Two brethren had been killed  and three wounded and 10 Indians killed as supposed.    Special Conference of the Church    It conviened Saturday the 13th of August and continued over the  Sunday. I did not record the minutes in my Journal    On the 19th I baptized brother and sister Rose and confirmed  them.    On the 25th I rode in company with Elder Kington to  Weber and spent the night with him.    Locating the Weber Settlemnient    I was sent by President Young to locate the fort for the inhabitants as  they could not agree among themselves. They had moved it several  times and still were disatisfied.    The day after my arrival I rode throughout  the Weber Settlement on both sides of the river examining the whole of the   country and collected the whole people together at 12 o'clock. I preached to  them 2 hours and heard them talk two hours more. I then  established the fort on the South side of the river in the midst  of the farming lands. I was weary and spent the night at Brother  Kingtons.    Next day I left Weber and rod to Salt Lake City  through hard rain showers. I then mounted ag horse and rode to  John Benbows on Cottonwood and spent the night with him. William  Benbow with two daughters had arrived from Wisconsin and 
 was at John Benbows. Next day I baptized William Benbow and   his two daughters Ann and Marion and confirmed them and then with  John and Wm Benbow I returned to the City.    General Conference of the Church   October the 6th 1853    The Conference lasted from the 6th until the 9th during which time  much business was done. Many missionaries were chosen to go  to the Lamanites and to various places besides and much instruction  was given by the Presidency and Twelve. All the proceedings  are published in the Deseret News. I received a mission in  connection with Ezra T. Benson for the settlement of Toella.  We were to pick but fifty families to settle that place. President  Young gave an address to the missionaries which I reported  and gave him.    Sunday Nov the 14th the Twelve met with the   company of Elders who were appointed to go to Green River to establish  a station at that place. We blessed them and set them apart  for the work. They were addressed by Wilford Woodruff and  Parley P. Pratt. This was the second company for that place  making in all 90 men.    On the evening of the 16th day of Nov I  met with the Regency upon whom the Presidency had called  to get up a new alphabet and make an imrovement in the English  language. The Regency had sat several evenings for that purpose    Parley P. Pratt had commenced a Spanish  school and I was attending it to learn the language.    On the 20th in company with Ezra T. Benson  and Dr. Andrews I rode to Toella City and spent the night at   Bishop Robery's.    New day was Sunday and we tode to 
 Willow Creek settlement and held a meeting with the people. I spoke to them  and was followed by E. T. Benson.    There were about one hundred men in this settlement  and they were beginning to fort up; and there were also about one hundred  friendly Indians. All settlements were counselled to life in forts  until they could wall in their cities. Thomas Clark was the Bishop  and we duined with him.    From Willow Creek on the same day I rode back  to Toella City and preached to a large congregation and on the following  day I returned to Salt Lake City but stoped on the way and appointed   a cite for a new fort and city.    On Sunday the 4th of December the mail came  in bringing good news from the Elders and tidings that war was   proclaimed between Russia and Turkey.    Sunday the 11th President Young addressed the people  and I reported it and prepared it for the Press.    On Monday the 12th the Legislative Assembly  commenced its sessions and next day both houses in joint session  received the Governor and his Message. I was one of the members  of the House.    Christmas day was on a Sunday. Hosea Stout  who had just returned from his mission to China addressed the congregation.  on the Chinees, their religion customs and pursuits including the  revolution among them at the time. In the afternoon Claudius  V. Spencer gave an account of his mission to England; and in  the evening I met with the 14th Ward and addressed the people  upon the subject of education and our duties to our children.    On the evening of the next day I met with   the 14th Ward and Parley Pratt delivered an address upon education  which I reported and spent the 30th in writing and preparing it.    On the last day of the year Frandklin D. Richards  addressed the young people and the children in the morning in the Ward  and in the afternoon we met for a social party and I addressed them in the evening.

 April 159, 1846 10 am    meeting at the Stand. Prest. O. Hyde W. Woodruff, J. Young, H. Clark    The meeting was called to order by El. Hyde. the Choir sung a hymn. Prayer was made to our Father in heaven after which  The Choir sung "The Lord will comfort Zion" W. Woodruff arose & sd br. sis friends I arise bef u with very peculiar adoration   & with a heart full of grati[tude] to my H Father—yes I rej[oice] that while the Temple of the Lord stands bef me [[a]nointed] to become  we live in one of the most important periods since chaos rolled out & if I must have chosen my time to dwell on the  Earth it is the time that we r now in, to live in an age of the world the most important we need no fiction for  reality has spoken in the loudest thunders & we of all want to see from da to da the rise & progress of the Ch  [o]f the LDS.  the many 1000s of S[ain]ts that r now dwellg on the Earth they have been seekg after this time even in the   days of old.    there r 1000s of S[ain]ts now bef[ore] me who have sought the same thing. the Gospel of J C. which he   preached & tried to open the eyes of the Jews that they might see the Gos of their forefathers, & he even gave up his   life in the [FIGURE]. I have perused the rev[elatio]ns of J. C  they were prin[ciples] that r set forth in divine truth. I am like one of   old who sd Lord they have digged down the altars, &c [##1 Kings 18:30##] by & by Elijah found there were 1000 of similar S[ain]ts in existence  when I became the El[der] of the L D S. I have heard within the last 12 yrs wt I never expected to see or hear  I have seen & heard the great & grand miracles of the Gospel. it is true ye LDS have had to pass thru a  narrow path, & you never cod rece an exalt[ation] if u never walked such a Roed. have the Bible the B of Mor  & u will find they have had to walk the same road. it was their dom[inion] & exalt[ation] & glories & they overcame  by their works on the Earth—all will centre in a grand focus. let us bear oppression, bec[ause] [ou]r lives have  been harassed. others have been in the same way & the reward is at the end of the journey. there has been  a miracle wrought in these days if there ever was one bef, in rearing a temple as it were with a sword  in one hand & a trowel in the o[the]r while I have been away in the same labor of love we have sent up our   prayers to our Fa[the]r in heaven in your behalf & we have end[eavore]d to bear off the word of the Lord & we have  not lab[ore]d in vain. the work of the L[or]d has never been more prosperous in England than at this time  we had represented in good standing bet[ween] 11 & 12000 & they r abu emigrating to Cal. they have only our  S[ain]ts in England all in review we have pub[lishe]d 3000 D. & Cs & sold 1000 bef[ore] I left. I sent the proclamation to  all the m of [Parl], circulated it in Wales, to the Jewish [Nobles] we have not been idle in the Land  I feel more & more conf[i]d every da[y] of my life & when the report reached us that they were burning out the  S[ain]ts & rather than to shed blood to go to the Rocky mountains it made a revival among them & they felt as a   general thing that it was fulfilling the B of Mor    I feel to say that I rej[oice] in the same faith & prin[ciples] that I  have done for the last few yrs. I dont profess to preach here bec[ause] u have had the Shepherds of Israel to lead u  & that in the B[ook] of M[ormon], D & C & every eternal principle that emanates from God & that we may have 
 a stronger connection with our God. I tell you, to have a connection with this while rather than with the throne   of the world - try to [illegible] will be trials that are placed on us   remember we are not alone poor an brave are   child of Israel & our fathers  I feel that we have fulfilled the command of God in building in the Temple  & shall have your chidren in the Eternal world.  I desire a will while out in mission & as your girls are as   have been saved before he comes & have not [we] redress now make them known to the great God his   ears & open to the prayers of the Saints & the time will come we will be perfectly obliged for the trials that  we have now - this is the 1st time that I have [addressed] you since the Temple has been [built] & it may be the   last - I have desired for a long time that Priest & [illegible] Jew & Gentile may understand the principles I will say  as Paul once did that he verily thought he was doing God service, & when his eyes were opened he felt for his   kindred & when I see that we leave now a good constitution, can shelter from the storm & when I see a dagger  thrust into the heart of the eagle - I have been ashamed when I have travelled among the crowned heads  of Europe & have been [wed] of the [hersn] & asked where is your [illegible] protection - but who can stand  in the end. In America stands in her own light, if the mormons were the only people that would suffer  it would not be so much but [look] as Greece & Rome, & you see the workers of ruin over which this land stands   I say they are here & my own country & my own Government will feel it - by & by it will fall on their own heads  when they have [us!] [Aha Aha] &c  Europe is making [capital] ^out^ of American mobocracy - I rejoice this   morning & have the [will] of standing this day with my aged Fa. in your midst - I rejoice ... seeing so many   of the Saints who are trying to overcome the world, keep their integrity,  let us [people] be faithful & seek God  let us leave vengeance in the hands of the Lord & I am willing to risk my destiny with this people & where  this people lives I will live &c & we are tied by the ties the strangest in nature - I am satisfied with the cause -   as in [Zion]:  I have been sufficiently acquainted with the Counsel to remain & sustain every man in his place -   I have tried to fulfil my mission to the best advantage -   I will say that while brother Hyde stays here I feel   perfectly to coincide with my [btn] the 12 to give counsel. I want my [Cricen's] to receive his counsel & let   it be an end of controversy while he remains with us - I am a passenger in your [illegible] - these are the   feelings that I have this morning - the Lord has not forgotten his people - Zion will yet arrive & clothe   herself in her beautiful garments I feel that I have got a little glimpse of the work of the last days   the Lord has sworn that he will gather Israel & the foundation will yet be more glorious & they will again   build Jerusalem & when the Gentiles reject that Gospel it will be time to take it to the Israelites by & by the 
 Lord will make a short work & any man ma[y] know that we [a]r[e] living in a very eventful age of the world  why have we been called to bear it? bec. there is no o[the]r pple in the world that would bear it. & who will   make the Sac[rifice]—there is none? nowhere? bec the nearer p[eo]ple get to Jehovah, the more persecution  they will have. W the further from God it will be [Carie Pellow] well met. br[other] & sis[ter] hold on to the end & you  will soon see the sign of the world & if a green tree will burn, how much more a dead tree. there is nothing  ever done within 600 miles of a LDS. but he has done it. not even an Earthquake or a flood but  what is laid to the charge of a mormon. get into the [illegible] for the world has been tired of [yo]u long  enough & [yo]u will be society for the while 13 cau of the Forest & the Savage – I say you ought to go away  from the U. S. & leave your log cabins & the [little shoulder] for a Temple – go away & let those  men who are more industrious build better towns & let leave your miserable [always] behind for  the people of the great cities of Wausau & Carthage & get away as fast as [yo]u can fo as it is requested by  the trouble govr the old cit., the U. S & all others. I say to you go & I pray that [yo]u may understand the  signs of the times. & go into the Wil[derness] build up Zion in the tops of the mountains that all the world  may come to [yo]u & I feel that [yo]u will all be satisfied when [yo]u get to the end of the race & may we   wash our selves white in the blood of the Lamb 
 W. Woodruff called the r[eal]w[orl]d of our friends while I r[ea]d a few of the words from 15 ch[apter] of St. John  "ye [are] my friends &c to from the beginning" the words which [struck] me were "ye [are] my friends (is I made known unto [yo]u"  it offords me [th]is small [cons[olatio]n] & realize that I [[kn]ow] that I stand in the midst of the friends of the L[or]d.  I've my reasons for bel[ieving] this, as that the S[ain]ts of God [have] lived in the da[y]s of Noah &c bec[ause] they held the command[ment]s  of God & says the Sav[io]r ye [are] my friends if [yo]u do what I command [yo]u. The Saints [kn]ow not what the L[or]d doeth &  Geo[rge] s[ai]d what my Fam[ily] hath told me even have I told [yo]u – one thing is clear in the cha[pte]r, if the S[ain]ts in their  labor work &c is a God of rev[elatio]n however diff[erent] or great that work mi[gh]t be, that God was powerful  enough to sust[ai]n them in it rev[elatio]n appears to have been the foundat[io]n. if any man [h]as a command to do work  & is not able to complete it he can go to his Mas[te]r - & ask to know [h]ow to complete it. rev[elatio]n appears to be  a being which the world generally opposes - the L[or]d co[ul]d raise up a ri[gh]teous man in the days of old Noah 
 & men generly wise up. & sa[y] that rev[elatio]n was done awa[y] for it ap[ea]rs to be an offence by the sai[n]ts in the  da[y]s of Christ.  we find the Jews very zealous in the rev[elatio]n that was written but when I began to present  any lit[erature] or [k]no[w]ledg[e] that was not previously [w]ritten they s[ai]d he is a false is a false teacher why need we any more  from this new messiah – Jesus s[ai]d if you only bel[ieve]d it they wrote the very things belonging to me the very  money that I must be sold for – the beast to ride into Jerusa[lem] – & he had power to ask his Fa[the]r & to ?1  notwithstanding all his reason he co[ul]d not convince the Jews that his prin[ciples] were pure – the Messiah altho[ugh]  he brou[gh]t forth the P[riesthood] & the fruits, & the gifts & graces & the teach[e]rs were ?2 among them but bec[ause]  he did not come accord[in]g to the ?3 of the Jews – ^they did not bel[ieve] him^ but he placed that gen[eratio]n that then co[ul]d not site in  judgm[en]t upon it – they loved darkness ra[the]r than li[gh]t – the world at large profess is love the Bible &c but  there was no harder words co[ul]d be heaped upon him than were – he was called a wine bibber &c so I say with  ?4 to the present age of the world there [are] no prin[ciples] that give greater offence to the world than rev[elatio]n – do not  ass[ume] Sp[irit] came from an Et]erna]l source – if so – I ask d[oe]s not the same sp[irit] require teach[in]g & feed[in]g from the same  source in ages gone by – if it req[uire]d rev[elatio]n to sust[ai]n Abel ?6 &c do we not need teach[in]g & feed[in]g from the same  source in order to accomplish the work ass[ociate]d ?7– we need that same or else the gospel of J[esus] C[hrist] [h]as ceased – if –  they had need of rev[elatio]n in those da[y]s w[h]y did they need thes[e] to unlovk the truth – it is a prin[ciple] that directs  with God from Et[ernity] to Et[ernity] – a rel[atio]n that [h]as not that connect[io]n with the God of heaven it will not ans[we]r  my purpose – a that ?8 sp[irit] that fills our bodies – we need teaching in order to [know] what our Fa[the]r wills  concerning us – the gospel of Christ was preached unto Adam Abel Enos, &c  it. gospel did they leach  unto adam it was the sam[e] Gospel that moroni carr[ie]d in lhe midst of heaven – they required rev[elatio]n  to guide them in their temporal sal[vatio]n – it req[uire]d Noah to build an Ark to save himself – if Lot [h]ad built  an ark it mi[gh]t [have] been burnt up – but fled to Zion – & when Jerusalem was encompassed – flee to the  mountains of Judea & so it is in every age of the world the L[or]d gives rev[elatio]n to suit their course – we as a  [people] bel[ieve] in rev[elatio]n – bel[ieve] the L[or]d [h]as raised up a prophet Seer & revelator – we bel[ieve] the L[or]d [h]as ag[ai]n began  to reveal matters to the chil[dren] of men – he [h]as commanded us to build a house in Kirtland we ?9  we went to the m[ountai]n there were commands given - they were driven from it & they were informed that    if they did they duty it sho[ul]d be accepted & he also give a command to build a house in this place there  is an object in completing this house it [h]as tried our faith & he has seen whe[the]r we will build the house  or else we shall be rejected with our de[a]d saith the L[or]d – where is the ind[ividual] who [h]as any faith in ser[vin]g    ?1   olrs    ?2    ?3  prophesies    ?4  reg[ulatio]n  res[ervatio]n    ?5  us  in    ?6  soul    ?7  us    ?8    ?9

 AFTER RECESS.  MORMONISM.  Sir JOHN THOMPSON continued his  explanation of the clauses of the bill dealing  with Mormons.    Mr. BLAKE thought it was not enough  that they should apprehend what the attitude  of the Government was with reference to the  persons who had given birth to the legislative   clauses before them. They had heard vari-  ous rumours and words of encouragement to  a section of people called Mormons in the  North-West. These words of encouragement  seemed to him out of place, if their doctrines  were what was represented. There were in  Ontario certain small scattered communities  of the Joseph Smith school, who, so far as he  could ascertain, had proved themselves good  emigrants and obeyed the laws. They were  of a different class to those of the Latter Day  Saints who had settled in the North-West.  It was right to emphasize the fact of the diffi-  culties that the State have had with the  Utah Mormons, and that very strin-  gent measures had to be adopted by  the Republic against their practices.  This was in consequence of the extreme  solidarity and determination of the people to  persist in concealing the legal evidence of  their abominable practices. As far as one  could judge, there was a disposition on a con-  siderable part of these people to seek a more  congenial soil than Utah. It seemed to him that  the settlement in the North-West was such  as to enable members on both sides to support  the Minister of Justice to provide stringent  laws against such polygamous practices.  The settlement called upon them to give  expressions of discouragement rather than  approval of such a colony in their midst. He  read from the will of Brigham Young, from  which a glimpse, he said, was obtained of their  marriage customs. Simple cohabitation, in  accordance with the Mormon Church, seemed  to be one of the principal, conditions of mar-  riage. In the Judgement of Mr. Justice Ander-  son, issued in 1889, he found that the belief  of the Mormons was that their Church was the  actual and veritable kingdom of God on  earth, that this kingdom was both temporal  and spiritual, that it would overthrow the  United States, that polygamy was a com-  mand of God, and that the Congress of the  States had no right to pass any law antagon-  istic to Mormonism, it was stated that the  North-West Mormons did not live in a  polygamous state, but it was stated that  there was a suspicious disproportion of the  sexes there. He had a letter from a friend  in Utah, who was cognizant with the course  of events transpiring there, and he told him  that in some instances the Mormons who had  gone to the North-West had not brought  their own wives, but that in such cases had  taken each a fresh young girl. (Laughter.)  He did not think that their friends  from the North-West should be eager  to promote settlers of this description.   It was neither wholesome nor profitable.  All that they could do was to put in opera-  tion all the legal machinery they could for  the discontinuance of these abominable  practices. He thought they were bound to  support the Minister of Justice in any reason-  able attempt to stamp out this crime of  polygamy. It should also be indicated in  the clearest language that it was not words  of encouragement but words of discourage-  ment that this Parliament had for Mor-  monism.    Mr. DEWDNEY said that some years ago  two or three of the leaders of the North-  West Mormons visited Ottawa asking for  concessions from the Government. He had  one or two interviews with them. The ap-  plications they made were not granted, but  they stated most distinctly that they had no  intention of practising the tenets of their  faith in the settlement. They gave the Gov-  ernment the most abundant assurance on that  point. Since then there had been rumours  that they had abandoned their promises.  An effort had been made by the Government  to ascertain if there was any foundation for  these reports, and through his deputy he  communicated with the leaders of the Mor-  mons in the North-West for explanations.  They replied, and stated emphatically that  they were not practising polygamy, that they  made a solemn promise when they went there  and they were determined to keep it.    Mr. BLAKE—What were the nature of  the concessions they wanted?    Mr. DEWDNEY—They wished to be al-  lowed to settle in communities in the hamlet  system, that is that they could live together  and live in the communal system.    Mr. BLAKE—The great difficulty with  these people is that they are being driven out  of the States because laws are put in force  against them. There is no reason to suppose  that they will abandon their practices here.  It is a serious question.    Sir JOHN MACDONALD—No doubt it is.    Mr. BLAKE—They have to leave their  own country and settle here, apparently to  carry out their abominable practices. Why  should they come here to obey laws which  they have refused to obey in the States?    Mr. DEWDNEY—They were fleeing from  justice.    Mr. MULOCH thought a more rigid penal-  ty should be imposed. Under the bill a  merely nominal fine might be imposed.    Sir JOHN THOMPSON consented to im-  prisonment being made the penalty for  polygamy.    Mr. CHARLTON said that no encourage-  ment should be given to the Mormons to come  to Canada. They were an undesirable   element.    Mr. McMULLEN said it was much to be  regretted, that any inducement whatever   should have been held out to these people.  It was exceedingly unwise that the slightest  encouragement should have been given to   them. It would have been better to have  prevented them from coming.    Mr. DEWDNEY—What inducements   were offered to these men?    Mr. McMULLEN—There was correspon-  dence.    Mr. DEWDNEY—We answer all letters.    Mr. LAURIER said that these people were  officially recognized.    Mr. BLAKE—I understand that the Lieu-  tenant-Governor visited the settlement and  stayed at the house of Mr. Card, whose wife  is one of the numerous daughters of Brigham  Young.    Mr. DEWDNEY—That was not inducing   them to come to Canada.    Mr. BLAKE—It was inducing them to   stay.    Mr. MITCHELL agreed that these people  should be compelled to obey the law, but he  did not think they should be prevented from  coming to Canada.    Sir JOHN THOMPSON said no encour-  agement had been given to the Mormons to  come to Canada. They left Utah because,  as they alleged, they were hardly used  generally and there was a prejudice against  them. Therefore they sought refuge in  Canada. Some of these people were British   subjects by birth. They were told distinctly  that they must understand the people of  Canada would be as firmly opposed to   polygamy as the United States were. They  replied that they simply wanted a refuge   and were willing to submit to the law. They  discussed the matter generally and argued  with him the principles of Mormonism, but  he told them there would be no leniency  towards polygamy.    Mr. MULOCK said it was clear from this   statement that the Mormons had entertained   a hope of perpetuating their institutions in  Canada.    The clause was carried.    The committee after passing a number of  clauses rose and reported progress.    STEAMBOAT INSPECTION ACT
