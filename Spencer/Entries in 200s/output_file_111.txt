 From thence I made a visit to the Islands.Twelve years before I carried the Gospel to Fox Island and gathered with me at the close of my mission to the Islands of the Sea about 60souls ^out^ of about ^a^ hundred which I baptized while there. I now paid these Islands a visit agains and after staying there several weeksI started for New Brunswick CanadaConsiderable of the distance I walked.One day after shouldering my carpet bag and walking 7 miles I waited 3 hours for the Stage to go to St John's and when it came along it was loaded down and could not take me. HereI had 42 miles to reach St John's on foot with a heavy travellingbag and no conveyance with a vast burning forest to go throughI did not stop to meditate or complain of my situation but swung my carpet sack over my shoulder and started on foot in good spirits. Most of the road was through dense forest rocky and poor soil many parts of the forest was inhabited by bears and wolves.After travelling a few ^miles^ I overtook an Irishman and we walked several miles together when a man came along in a waggon and carried my bag 5 mileson before me to Mr McGowings. When I arrived I found it safe and had a chance to send it on 15 miles farther to Mr Tilton's. I took dinner with the Irishman we and left him and I had 15 miles more to walk before I could stop for the nightI found the whole forest as I came along laid waste by the late fires which swept fencesdwellings barns mills lumber yard and everything else in its march leaving but a few dwellings remaining.Although I began to be very weary and lame yet I entered the dark forest before me and I foudn my last 15 miles a dreary road indeed. It seemed as though I could not get through and when I did arrive 
 At Mr Tilton's I was so lame I could scarcely walk at all and I was underthe necessity of going to bed without my supper. I washed myself in coldwater from head to foot to take the soreness out of my [cords]. I had walked 35 miles during the day a thing which I had not done before for 10 years.After journeying by foot boat and stage we arrived at the ferry of the Beaubours Island on the 22nd of July whereI left the stage feeling very thankful that my bones were whole and my life preserved.I crossed the ferry to the Island walked one mile through a pleasant grove to the house of Elder Joseph Russel's.  I found him home and had a happy greeting. I was thankful to shake hands with a Latter-day Saint after travelling two weeks without seeing any of the Saints.I was quite unwell next morning whichwas SundayElder Joseph Russell was located upon an Island called Beauburs Island situated at the junctionof the two branches of the Miramichis River 7 miles aboveChatham. The Island is 1 1/2 miles in length and halfa mile wide. Brother Russell had owned the whole of the Island for eleven years during which time he hadbuilt 23 ships upon it with an average tonage of 650tons each. His location land and improvements were at a low rate worth $30,000 besides 3 ships on hand. He was calculating to sell on the 5th of Nov at some price or other settle his business and go to the Valley.The Island was a very beautiful and plesant situation a good location for ship building in the centre of the river which abounds with salmon mackeral herring chadand other fish in their seasonBrother Russell was also a Presiding Elderover a small Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints on  
 the Island. He had a chapel in his own house. I met with him onthis Sunday morning and was much edified with his teachings and pleased with the order carried out in his meetings and family circleand in his temporal business. I met with them in the afternoonand spoke to them from Amos: "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the Prophets." [##Amos 3:7##]Next evening I visited the burying groundof Bro Russell's family were laid 4 of his children who had been taken from the various places where they had been buried and laid together upon this Island. One of them was a young man who held the office of Priest in the Church and died strong in the faith.The burying ground was surrounded by a cluster of tall Pine trees and a wall of solid mason work 12 feet square and 7 feet high with a cope stone enclosed the spot where the bodies laid.I received a letter from brother Gibsongiving news of the Epistle of the Twelve and that the quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church was filled up with Charles C. Rich Lorenzo Snow Erastus Snow and Franklin D Richardswho had been thereunto appointed. I was also informedthat Capt. Dan Jones had lost 50 of his company with the cholera from St Joseph's to the Bluffs.On the 27th I baptized ArchibaldRussell son of Elder Joseph Russell and confirmed him and at the wish of the father we went to his family burying ground and knelt before the Lord and I dedicated and consecrated it.Next day I parted with Sister Russelland the Saints and with Elder Russell and his son I left the Island to go to Baideque. I had been greatly blessed while on the Island and received great kindness from brother and sister Russell who were full of faith and good worksWe ran into the harbour of Bei^e^dequeat sunrise on the 31st and next day hired a man to carry 
 us in a waggon four miles to brother Wm Maxfield's where we arrived quite weary and took breakfast and then went to a stream near by and caught a dozensalt water trout.In the afternoon I met with the Saints at BroPickets. I found 22 members and 1 Priest in the Bideque Branch rather in a cold state as a body. I preached to them the Gospel andspoke of the signs of the times; then returned with Elder Russel to Bro Wm. Maxfield's There was also 4 Saints in Charlottetown.I found Prince Edward's Island a beautiful farming country to appearance but with all this the people were nearly in a state of starvation the crops having failed for two years past and the merchants were taking all the money out of the country All the colonies seemed to be in a deplorable state, hundreds of miles of the country had been burned over this year with fire, sweeping millions of acres of forest farms fences barns dwellings millslumber and lumber yards and in some cases the inhabitants had to flee into the sea or on the beach to escape the flames. Every branch of business was dead and the people were leaving for the States every possible way.On the 1st of Augst I met with the Saints at the house of Brother Wm Maxfield for the purpose of ^re^organizing the Bedeque Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints. Conference opened by singing and prayer and after remarks from W Woodruff, President, on the inportance of the reorganization of the Branch it was moved and carried that Brother Maxfield be ordained to the office of Elder to preside over it and John Maxfield to the office of Priest and they were ordained under the hands of Elders Woodruff and Russell.[redacted]was by the Conference cut off the Church for adultery and drunkenness. During this ConferenceI spoke 3 hours or more upon the travels of the Pioneers location of the Saints in the Valley gave counsel to the members 
 blessed fine children and healed two who were sick.On the 5th of August I took the parting hand of Brother Russell to return to my family. My mission to the eastern Churches had been given to me by the Presidency to preside over the churches in the United States and the British Provinces and to obtain monies to releive the Church of indebtedness. From Elder Joseph Russell I obtained for this object $1500 and when we parted he also gave me personally a new suit of clothes, other presents paid all my expenses and gave me money to help mehome to the Valley.I reached Boston on the 10th took conveyances to Cambridgeport and arrived at my house and found my family in bed but Mrs Woodruff  arose and gladly welcomed me and her sister Sarah B. Foss who had accompanied me from Portland.In reading the papers after my return to my family I found statements that in the Hungarian army there were fifty two thousand Jews fighting against Austria and Russia; and that a disease had appeared in the Russian army called the lice itch. It appears like lice or maggots under the skin in the flesh and those afflicted soon become a mass of corruption and die in great misery and none are cured.A revelation in the Doctrine and Covenantssays that among the judgements of the "Last days" the flies should bite the bodies of men and maggots should come in theirflesh and their flesh fall from their bones and eyes from their sockets.On the 1st of September I took the cars to Fall River and met with the Fall River Branchand sat until night hearing a difficulty until my head heart and brains ached. Next day I preached to the Saints there and had a good time. 
 I rode to New Bedford on the 4th preached at nightand organized a Branch and appointed Elder Joseph Crapo to preside and Elder Cory his counsellor.Next day I returned to my family in Cambridgeport and several nights afterwards there was a fire near our house and some buildings burned down.The last European arrival brought the news that Hungary had fallen beyond redemption and their armiesdefeated and surrendered to the Russians and AustriansOn the 15th in company with MrsWoodruff our two children and Rhoda and Phebe Foss myself and Elder Leonard Hardy took train to Bradford.The 18th was a day set apart by the Bradford Branch of the Church to have their annual Plum Island ride and I and my family  had been invited to join them.It was a pleasant day and we assembled in the morning at 1/2 8 o'clock at Mr Burbank's where we found our procession consisting of 18 carriages containing 78 persons.Mr Burbank being the eldest led the van and was followed by Wilford Woodruff. On the way we were overtaken by 25 persons drawn in the "Bonnyboat" by 6 cream colored horses who headed our company as we went to Newberryport where we stayed 15 miles from Mr Burbanks.Reaching the Island we went into a romantic valley surrounded by hills of sand and plum bushes A spot of half an acre in the centre of the valley was well covered with nice grass. Around this spot we formed our carell of carriages; upon the green grass the females spread their table cloths and loaded them with every dainty 
 that heart could wish. The ground having previously been dedicated by the Saints Elder Woodruff was seated at the head of the table and after he had asked a blessing upon the food and bounties of the earth spread before us we feasted with glad hearts and cheerful countenances walked to the sea shore spent an hour and returned home.About this time the French Minister at Washington was dismissed and offered his passports and invited to return home. High words had also passed between the British and American Minister.On Sunday the 30th I met with the Saints inCambridgeport. Dr John M. Bernhisal met with us and gave a rehersal of affairs in the Valley which was interesting. He had come as a representative from the Valley to Washington hearing our petition to Congress for a Territorial Government.Copy of a LetterReceived From the First PresidencyGreat Salt Lake CityJuly 25, 1849.Dear Brother Woodruff,As our mail is now making up for the States we cannot let so favourable an opportunity of communicating with you pass unimproved.Our prospects for grain are tolerably good and if we are not flooded with immigration intending for the mines but compelled to tarry here we should have plenty for the ensuing year. Out wheat harvest is now at its height and is coming off for better than appearance seemed to warrant The spirit of industry which has ever characterized the Saints 
 of the Most High God has been brought to bear with wonderful effect upon the burning and arid desert.The next time that you encounter the hardships privations and toil of a journey over the plains and mountains you will meet with a very different reception from what attended yourfirst arrival here. Friends will greet your arrival and the productsof the earth will administer to your comfort.Our city and Valley is fast improving roads are being made and bridges mills and houses building on every side with astonishing rapidity considering our circumstances and the disadvantages under which we labour but the blessings of health peace and union have attended us. Hence our prosperity.We have a settlement in the Utah Valley and have extended North above the Weber river. We have irrigated our land which is considerable labour but ^it^ will dimithdiminish as we improve in fixtures and experience. One thing is certain. All the necessary products of the earth for the sustinance of man can be raised. You have probably learned before this that we are endeavoring to obtain a legal government from the United States. Dr Bernhisel is East upon this business and brother A WBabbitt will leave to morrow as our delegate to Washington.Our object is to gain admission asa Sovereign State into the Union. Whenever you can use your influence to further this object do so. Also gather up and come on with all you can bring another season. We shall be quite happy to see you as will all your friends.We had yesterday a celebration of the anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneers in this Valley. It was a day long to be remembered. Your father enjoyed it well being one of the 24 aged fathers selected as part of the escort. For full details of these proceedings see the Frontier Guardian. Wishing for the peace of heaven to rest upon you 
 Your brethren in the Gospel of ChristBrigham Young Heber C. KimballWillard RichardsThis letter I copied into my daily Journal to which afterwards I obtained the authographs of the First Presidency.Dr Bernhisel spent the afternoon of the 5th of October with me and he related some ofThe Last Words of Joseph the Prophet.Brother Bernhisel had lived in the family of President Joseph Smith for years and was with him in prison on the morning of the day of his martyrdom. He informed me that Brother Joseph addressed his remarks to him alone when he said "I am going as a Lamb to the slaughter yet I shall die with a conscience void of offence towards God and man. I feel as calm as a Summer's morning" and the expression of his countenanceshowed that he was so. He added "It will yet be said of me that he was murdered in cold blood" Elders Little and Hardy called upon me and spent the evening.The papers at this time were stirred up and devoted considerable attention to the affairs of the Latter-day Saints their organizing a State government and theelection of Brigham Young as Governor.On the 15th of October I and my family arrived at Scarborough on a visit to my wife's father and our friends in Maine and on the 20th we returned home again.A week later I went on board the David Porter and sailed to Dennis on Cape Cod and next day rode to West Harwich and held a meeting with the Saints. Most of the brethren were out on a fishing voyage and when they 
 returned the following day they gave me a barrel of fat mackerel to take home with me.While here I administered by the laying on of hands to an aged sister of 84 years old and she immediately arose from her bed and commenced washing some small articles.On the 3rd of November I returned home and on Sunday held a meeting at my house.I received a pamplet some days later entitled Consititution of the State of Deseret with the Journal of the Convention.I left home on the 17th took cars at Boston and arrived at Wiliamanti that night and next day met with the Saints in the house of brother Dan Atwood the father of Millen Attwood who lived with President Young. He had three sons in the Church and talked of going to the Valley in the Spring. This branch of the Church was called the Mansfield Branch and contained thirty five members.Three days afterwards I was at New York and on the 23rd I arrived at Philedelphia where I found Dr John Bernhisel and we spent the night together.Next day we called at the Office of ColKane but was not in and on the Sunday morning I preachedto the Church at Philedelphia and in the afternoon Dr Bernhiselgave an account of the history of the Valley. In the evening I preached to a full house and the Spirit of God was with us.On the 28th I took cars for Newark. In the cars where I was many noted members of Congress were on their way to Washington. It was said that Hon Henry ClayGen Cass Gov. Seward Hon Mr Wilmot Truman Smith Mr Wheeler and others were there.I took cars to Philedelphia Dec 14where I arrived on the same day and called upon Col Kaneand saw a sleigh robe presented to him by Dr Bernhisel as a present from President Young. It contained 7 wolves skins 10 fox skins got up with great taste. 
 The Celebrated J^G^erard CollegeThis college is one of the finest buildingsI ever saw.  I visited it on the 3rd of December. The general design of the building is that of Greek Temple having eightcolumns on each end and eleven on each side (counting the corner columns both ways) making in all thirty four columns.The columns are 6 feet in diameterout 55 feet in height ^on the face of the abacus.^ and the capitals 8 feet 6 inches high 9 feet 4 inches wide Each shaft is channelled in 24 semicircular flutes.The net amount of marble in each column including the base and capital is 1346 cubic feet 103 tons and the cost $12,9^9^94. The total cost of the 34columns $51,976. ThThe exterior of the cella or body of the building measure 111 feet wide 169 feet long and 59 feet 8 incheshigh. The whole of the exterior of the building is composedof marble of a very superior quality.Every block of marble in the building is set on peices of milled lead. The roof is composed of marble tiles 4 1/2 feet long 4 feet wide 2 3/4 inches thick. Each tile is 776 lbs and each saddle 213 lbs. The whole numberof the tiles in the roof being 2046 and of saddles 2061:the aggregate weight of the tiles and saddles is 906 tonsMarble chimney tops and cast-iron sky lights also weigh 20 tons and the lead and masonary of the gutters 43 1/2tons making the entire weight of the roof 969 1/2 tonsThe building is three stories in heighthThe first and second stories are 25 feet from flour toflour and the third 30 feet in the clear. Each story is divided as directed by the will into 4 rooms 50 feet 
 square in the clear. The outside walls are four feet in thickness the inside 3 feet. Each arch including its abutments contains 117,000 brick which together with the marble floor on top makes the weight suspended over each room about 350 tons. The stairways are situated in the forecorners of the building the spaces allotted to them being each 22 feet ^6 inches wide 26 feet 6 inches long^ tons. They are all composed of white marble and are 5 feet 3 inches in width with two leaandings or quarter pieces ^paces^ in each story.  The plan on which they are constructed is that of geometrical stairs having one end of each step secured in the wall and one edge resting on the step below. All the stair ways as well as the landing in the upper stairs are finished with rich bold rods ^balstrades balustrades^ of cast iron and maogany rails sprining from many ^massive^marble newels.

J. Boswell Director Nov 28, 1849.Speechdelivered byMr Copway or Koh-Ge-Ga-Gah-bow Chief of the Ojewa ^Ojebwa^ nation Before a large audience at New YorkOn the eve of Dec. 15, 1849.Ladies and Gentlemen—American Citizens:Of necessity my address this evening must be short; yet I will touch upon a few prominant items which I consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep interest in the history of every nation under heaven. Therefore the history of the Indians or their present condition has also a deep interest — an interest of greater importance than at first presents itself to the mind of the American people. Although it may appear to them as covered with a cloud or buried deep from their view yet it non the less existsThen listen to me: I have deeply 
 studied the situtaiton and interest of of my brethren the Red Men for years and I have resolved to call ^aloud^ upon the white man of this nation to give ear to my petitions.If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst making a display of oratory like the white man it is not because he has not talent but because he has not the chance to exercise it.1st: My object in visiting the United States is to present a petition to this government that they may assist me in concentrating the Indians together that they may live and not die. I want Congress to grant them a portion of Territory that they can call their own and be concentrated upon it that they may not be driven from it any more. They once were the owners and occupiers of the whole soil of all North America. The white man cameand removed the Indians and continually have driven them until they can see no hope but the grave before them.I now ask in their behalf a territory to settle them upon that they may have a permanent home forever and come under the United States Government and become part and parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied the history^interest^ of all both the white and the red man.1st: give them a Territory that they can call their own where their children can point to the graves of the fathers and say, We can now live in peace and be driven no more; we can visit the graces of our fathers with none to drive us from them; and they will be inspired to engage in every laudable untertaking that now marks the course of the white man.2nd You can then establish schools among them that will be of benefit to them. They would obtain knowledge and make a good use of it. The Gospel could then be introduced among them and they would be far more ready to receive it when they find the white man is consistant and willing to do them good; but when the white man 
 offers the Gospel to the Indians one year and the next comes and drives him from his home and the graces of his fathers he has no faith or confidence in either the white man or his Gospel.3rd you can then introduce agriculture amongst them and they will receive it for they would then see of necessity they must cultivate the land or dies. They could not depend upon game for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating the soil make improvements and take delight in them the same as the white man.4th They would then be in a position where they would be delivered from the ill consequences of constant removing which has continually followed them for many years. The ill consequences of removing have been multiplied and very great. This has been on main reason why schools have been unproductive of good among them. This is also the reason why missionaries have done no more more good among them.The Indians are fast decreasing and passing away. That is the cause of all this. There are various causes. There constant removing is one causeDisease which has been introduced among them by the white man in the capacity of traders missionaries and emigrants also also the introduction of alcohol have had a tendency to waste them away; also wars among themselves and wars with the white man all of which have continually wasted away the Indian tribes.I will here remark that in the origin of the wars with the whites the conducting of those wars and in the treaties of peace made and broken the Indianshave been badly treated and abused by the whitesFor instance some ruffian or tracker visits the Indians introduces wild fire or alcohol among them and will get the Indian drunk and perhaps drunk 
 himself and will cheat them in any way he can and perhaps kill some of them and in his career he gets killed himself. Then the cry goes forth that the savage Indians are killing and murdering the inhabitants of the country. It is proclaimed in all the public journals of the Union. Yes one side of the story is proclaimed as with peals of thunder throughout the earth; but no voice is raised in behalf of the poor Indian. Their story is not told. The world hear it not; they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the story of the white man is known and proclaimed to the world the armies of war must be prepared and soldiers sent forth to drive and kill the Indians and burn their homes and in this way the most desolating and expensive wars have been carried on for many years until we feel it is time for the white man to take adifferent course with the Indians,As an example of the bad effects of continually removing the Indians I would refer you to the Cherokee nation. That people were fast improving following rapidly in the footsteps of the white man had extensive farms and good dwellings and continued rapidly advancing in improvements until they were suddenly brought to a stand in their course by being cruelly called upon by the State of Georgia to give up their lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the wilderness. And thus it was that thir mighty nation instead of receiving that support ^encouragement^ and comfort from the nation that it ought to receive was forced by the cruel hand of oppression to bow ^out see copy^ their heads in sorrow ^and despair^ until they shall be called to pass through the same ordeal again to remove and remove until they are anihilated from off the face of the earth.Oh Ye white man what encouragement do you give the Indian to plant to build to learn to cultivate the earth or receive a religion that professes love mercy kindness and truth while those who profess to enjoy it deals out such deeds of oppression and cruelty upon the 
 heads of the red man^men^ that it drives them to madness and despair.Let the American nation stay their hands from this time forth in their oppression and driving of the Indians lest they drive them beyond a point which the Indian will endure and return a blow upon the head of the white man which will fill many a habitation with death.Once give the Indians a Territory—a home where they can have a full assurance that their ears or those of their children will no more be saluted with a call to remove from their lands then if if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement then cast them off as not worthy of your support or attention but until then you are not justified your garments are not clear.The spirit of the age and times demands that Congress should take immediate action upon this matter. 1st: The Indians cannot retain their lands.Emigration of the white men are already surroundingthem and in their midst and the richness and fertility of the Indians lands are a temptation to the white man and invite him to settle thereon.2nd the Indians have too much land more than what they need to till and cultivate for their support.Let there be a Territory set off on the North West of Iowa North of Council Bluffson the Missouri on which there is no no white settlement and let the Indians East of the RockyMountains and in the United States be gathered up in it. Then let other Territories in the West be appropriated and let all the Indians on the North American Continent be collected together and learn us to cultivate the earth. They will soon associate themselves together and cease their wars among themselves also with the white men. If there is not something of this kind done the vast emigration through all the Indian 
 lands will soon destroy the game and then want and starvation will ensue and this will bring on war between the white and red men.If my proposition is accepted by the American Government and they will carry it out it will be of vast benifit both to the Indians and the people of the United States.1st the benefit to the Indians will be: It will give them a permanent home where schools can be established among them and their children taught the English language. Farms can also be opened among them and when they see they have a permanent home for themselves and their children and they have no game to depend upon for food they will immediately immediately go to work and cultivate the earth like ^the^ white man. The Gospel can then be introduced among them to a good effect and they will receive it with thankfulness when they can be made to believe that the hand that deals out the Gospel to them is not laying a plan to take the advantage of them and preparing a way to drive them from their home and country. It will not only unite their intrest and attachment towards each other but their regard and interest with that of the United States.The benefit to the Government is less expenses:1st buying their lands and paying them yearly annuities which is costing the government immense sums of money.2nd: The continual transporting of Indians from place to place. There has laready been 96,000 Indiansremoved by the Government.3rd: The keeping of many Indian Agents at great expence to Government could then be dispensed with.4th: Fortifications have now to be errected on the borders of all Indian tribes with the intention of keeping the Indians in Subjection. These would not be needed if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for 
 by having this trail clear and no encroachments of the white man upon their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.I am going to Washington soom to lay my petition before the Congress of the United States and urge them to grant my prayer for the benefit of both the white and red man.I want your aid: I want you to sign my petition that the voice of thousands may be heard in behalf of this petition. I want the names of legislators governors and American Citizens in general that my prayer may be heard and answered.Give the North American Indians a home a place where the soles of their feet can rest in peace in a situation where you can teach them literature agriculture and commerce and give them the chance the white man has and I prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will ere long be found among them their philosophers their Franklins and Washingtons who would do honour to any civilized or Christian nation on the globe. But let this nation turn a deef ear to my petitions and the petitions of the Indians—continue to oppress them and drive them to desperation and the hour is near when the Campfire will be seen upon many a hill. The war hoop willre-echo from one end of the Rocky Mountains to the other. The Indian will then sell his life as dear as possible and deal out death whereever an opportunity offers. When this blow is struck it will be terrible to all. May God forbid that such a blow should fall at all that the scenes of bloody Bloody Brook should ever ^any^ more be enacted.American citizens it is to ward off this blow that I now stand before you—that I now call upon this nation hearing a petition unto them 
 Among other remarks he said "I appliedaccording to the wish of President Young for a Territorial Government. I had my last sad and painful interview with President Polk. I found he did not feel to favour your people and had his men of his own stamp picked out to serve as Governor and other officers who would have oppressed you in any way to fill their own pocketsHe would not appoint men from among yourselves and I saw it absolutely necessary that you should have officers of your own people to govern you or you were better without any government. I had to use my own discretion and I withdrew the petition.Synopsis of 1849During this year I travelled through eleven of the United States and New Brunswick Miramichi and Prince Edward's Island making a distance of 5040 miles.I held 92 Public Meetings.I Baptised 11 persons.Confirmed 21.I ordained my father in law Esra Carter. 
 1850I returned home from my travels among the Churches around Boston on the 7th of Jan and received some letters among which was an Epistle from the First Presidency from which I extract the following items:"They have universal health [in the Valley]good crops plenty to eat no sickness or death of late are prospering on every hand are laying off three new cities one at Brownville one at Utah Valley and one at SandpitchValley 200 miles South of Salt Lake Valley ^and^ from 50 to 100 families had gone too ^where to^ form a settlement at Sanpitchunder the Presidency of Father Morley. They had organized the Nauvoo Legion and it would have been a source of joyto the Saints throughout the Earth could they have witnessedits movements on the day of its great Parade and to have seen the men ground their arms not by command but simply by request repair to the Temple Block and with pick and spade open the foundation for a place of worship and erect the pilasters beams and roof so that we have now a commodious edifice 100 by 60 feet with brick wallswhere we assemble with the Saints from Sab^b^ath to Sabbath and almost every evening in the week to teach counsel 
 and devise ways and means for the prosperity of the Kingdom of God and we feel thankful that we have a better house or bowery forpublic worship the coming winter than we have heretofore had in any Winter in this dispensation. Also the walls of the Council House are nearly completed (out) The foundation is laid andthe brick prepared for an extensive storehouse and Granary and no exertions are wanting on our part to push forward the public works as fast as tithing and means are put into our hand."The Presidency spoke of their great Celebration on the 24th ^of July as long to be remembered^; the establishment of the Perpetual Emigration Fund and their resolution to send the Gospel to all the world as soon as possible. All of the Twleve Apostles who were in the Valley with many others had their missions assigned to them to the nations. Elder John Tayloraccompanied by Curtis C. Bolton and John Pack were for France; Elder Lorenzo Snow to Italy and Joseph Torantowith him. Erastus Snow to Denmark and Peter Hansonwith him; Franklin D.

Elder Parley Pratt was appointed for a Western mission to the Islands in the SpringElder John Forsgreen was to go on a mission to Sweeden.The Epistle spoke of Elder Orson Prattdoing a great work in England and said"Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeportand has been comforting and instructing the Saintsin Canada and the Eastern States the past year If Elder Woodruff will gather up all the Saints in his vicinity and come with them to this place he will be doing a great work and will be opening a way for a visit to those nations who have both 
 eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israel come tell us of the things of God for we have heard that God is with you."The Presidency called loudly upon me to gather up all the Saints in the Eastern Country and bring them to Zion to establish woolen and cotton factories &c.The following is an item of the minutes of the Conference.On motion President Brigham Young was sustained as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by unanimous vote and Heber C.

PrattOrson Pratt Wilford Woodruff John Taylor George A. SmithAmasa Lyman  Ezra T. Benson Charles C. Rich LorenzoSnow Erastus Snow and Franklin D. Richards as members of that quorum.On Sunday the 24th of Feb. we had with us at our meetings at Boston Elders Wallace Haywood and Wolley from Zion. We had a glorious time I addressed the Saints and was followed by Elder Haywood Wolley and Wallace who spoke much to our edification. I felt the Spirit of God like fire shut up in my bones as I spoke upon the things of the Kingdom of God.I was 43 years of age on the 1st of March of the year 1850.The day after I took cars for Portland and next day with my brothers in law Ezra and Ilus Carter I went in a sleigh to Scarboro to see Father Carter whom we found lonely and on the evening of the 4th I returned home again.On the 6th myself Mrs Woodruff  her brother Ilus and his wife went into Boston and had and interviewwith brothers Haywood and Wolley and consulted with them 
 upon the purchase of a bill of goods and then assisted in purchasing a bill of goods mostly dry good to the amount of 15.00 dolars from the firm of Newton Eaton &co. I paid brother Wolley 245 dollars for waggons and sundries.Next day we purchased another bill of goodsto the amount of 15.00 dollars and another bill of crockery of 200 dollarsI received 100 dollars from M. C. Pevey and gave it to M. Cannonto buy oxen for said Pevey.The day following we continued our purchases for my brother in law Ilas Carter until dark.On the 11th I gave M Cannon 555 dollarsto purchase cattle for the emigration near the outfilling point. I took 3000 lbs of stationary and books from the Eastern Depot to long warf and put on board of the ship Beatrice also 900 lbs of baggage for S. B. Foss.Next day I continued with my brother-in-lawIlus and made a bill of hardware also a bill of 600 dollars worth of shoes.Elder Alexander Badlam arrived home today from the gold diggings of California. He had been gone one year and brought two thousand dollars worth of gold dust and to me he brought as a present from several brethren in the mines9 1/2 ounces of gold dust; and this began to fulfill the portion of my Patriarchal blessing which said I should have access to the treasures hid in the sand to assist me in my necessities and in the gathering of many orphan children to Zion.Elder Badlam put into my hands200 dollars and sent from the gold mines to help Thomas Knowlesto Zion and I wrote informing him that he might get ready to go with us. Brother Badlam besides the gold he brought for himself had brought considerable to cheer the heartts of several others sent to them from the mines to help thememigrate to the Valley. 
 On the 23 of March Professor Orson Pratt arrived from Liverpool where he had been  presiding over the British Mission and we sat up together late conversing upon the business of the Kingdom.Next day we went into the city of Boston together and met Erastus Snow and George B. Wallace and in the afternoon we met with the Saints and Erastus Snow gave an account of the dealings of the Lord with the brethren in the Valley and concerning the cricket war which had sorely tried the people Elder Orson Pratt followed and spoke much to our edification. He expected to increase the Millennial Star from five thousand to twenty thousand.Early next morning Elder Orson Pratt parted with me to go to New York previous to his return to England.I attended the trial of Professor Webster for the murder of Dr Parkman which closed on the 30 with a verdicof murder in the 1st degree and sentence  to be hung.On the 3rd of April Elder Erastus Snowtook his departure from Boston on board the Steamer boundfor Europe while we were very busy packing up and getting ready to start for the Valley.I held my last meeting with the Saints in Cambridgeport on Sunday the 7th of April and on the 9th I left Boston with my family other relatives and 100 Saints and arrived in New York where we were joined next morning by 100 more Saints and at 5 o'clock P.M. we left with 209 in our company and arrived in Philadelphia in the morning Our baggage and freight amounted to 42 thousand pounds weight.On the 18th we arrivied at Pittsburgh and I was visited by several Steamboat captains who wanted to take our company to St Louis and finally I made a contract with Captain Devinney of the De WitClinton to take our company to St Louis on the following 
 terms:Cabin passingers $8; steerage $2 fright 20 cts per 100 pounds and he agreed to wait for our other boats to comeup.  Most of us spent the night on board the section boat.I received a letter stating that the hindboat had met with an accident and knocked a hole in her which had detained them two days to repair.Next day I received another letter from the hind boat requesting us to tarry until they came up. The second boat containing Elder Leonard Hardyand company arrived this morning and we unloaded bothour boats weighed the baggage and put it on board the De Wit Clinton and assigned the births to the company.Three days later our last boat arrived and they with their baggage were got on boardmaking 212 souls of the Saints and 200 other passengers.Next day we started and I never found a Captain of a boat who took more pains to make us comfortable than Captain Devinney.We arrived at St Louis Missouriand I was soon visited by Elders Heywood and Felt.I made a contract with CaptainBaker to take up our company on the Sacramentoto Council Bluffs on the following terms. Cabin $13deck $4 freight 50 cts per 100 lbs.The Sacramento came alongside the Clinton and took our freight on board which occupied most of the day.I felt thankful to God that we had arrived at St Louis in safety and no lives lost and up to this time we had no deaths among us but this night Sister Bird was taken sick with cholera and the next day^morning^ she died. 
 We called upon the city authorities to bury herand the Sexton soon came with a coffin and we paid the last respectsto the remains of our sister.After a hard days work to get our company and boat ready we started at dark but brothers Leonard Hardy and Russel were left on shore they however afterwards came down and the Captain took them in.On the 6th we stoped about 2 hours at Bloomfield and brother  Branch went to the grave yard and buried his child that had died of the worm feverNews met us on our way up the riverthat many were coming back from the Plains and selling out their teams and going home and so the price of oxen was falling. They had made a rush to the mines before any grass had grown to sustain their oxen.We started for St Joseph's on the 12th of May and early on the morning of the 14th word was given for the passengers to walk on shore to lightenthe boat and some of our company with mules left forthe Bluffs and when we got ready they could not be foundIt was supposed they had fainted by the way and our Captain and others rode miles in search of them but cameback without finding them and then we started up the river with our boat and came upon them about 5 milesa head.We arrived at Fort Kearney on the morning of the 15th and left all the passengers and freightnot bound for the Bluffs and went on to Deseret Depot where we arrived about dark. Here I found my brotherin law Ilus Brother Badlam and many others. I spent most of the night on my feet taking chargeof our baggage.Next day I reached Kanesville 
 had a little time with Elder Hyde and then returned to my company which I had left to visit in Kanesville.On the 18th I again rode to Kanesvillewith Elder Badlam and Leonard Hardy spent a little time with him and then went to Elder Hyde's where I found him and Orson Pratt.I spent a long evening in conversation with these brethren of the Twelve. Elder Hyde wished me to lay before the Presidency in the Valley the affairs of the Church in Pottawatamie County Iowa. He wished me to say to them that all the men of capital were leaving for the Valley; men from the East and England and all whowere able to go were making their fit out and talking of starting.There was another class he said who were able to get a fit out in part even able to get waggons and they were helped on by Bishop Hunter so that the poorestpart of the community alone remained.He did not think Kanesville and the surrounding country should be broken up which would be the case if it continued thus and wished me to lay the subjectbefore the Presidency with many more details that he gaveme of his views.Elder Orson Pratt wished me to say to the Presidnecy that there were many Elders in England of power faith and talent who had to labour hard to get breadfor their familises and when Elders were sent to them from America who could not edify them they felt it a tax upon them and that their own Elders were more efficient in the ministry than some of those sent unto them.On the next day according to appointmentI met in Conference with Orson Hyde Orson Pratt and the High Council near the Stand in the Grove one hour 
 before the General meeting.  Elder Hyde addressed the Conference in Substance as follows:There was business left unfisnished at the Conference which must be closed today. As some of the officers were going to the Valley others must be appointedBishop Johson wsa going and another Bishop must be appointed in his place also men to visit the variousBranches who would attend the Council and carry the Spirit of the Council to the people and bring back their spirit to them. Joseph Young and Benjamin Clapp who were appointed last year were not with them at all either in body or, spirit and whenever they did attend a Council Joseph Young could not stay until he went away. We will let that pass over we will let them go.Elder Hyde also remarked that it was necessary to make arrangements to receive the poorthat had of late arrived among us. I have given Counsel through the Guardian for the poor not to come here and some have contrary to this counselthrough misguided zeal counselling them to come and such must hear the consequences of it.It was afterwards voted that a Bishop be appointed to take the place of Bishop Johnsonand that Elder Stoddard be appointed to travel amongthe Churches and call such men to his aid as he needed. Three men were appointed as committeto locate the poor.We then repaired to the Standbefore the congregation and each item of businesswas presented to the people and Elder Hyde mademany remarks upon each item as it came alongand gave counsel to the people. 
 In the afternoon Elder Orson Pratt preached and related the progress of the work in England of the thousands who were coming into the Church the publications from the Millennial Star office and the opposition manifesting. He was followed by Elder Woodruff.The speaker said he had baptized while on this mission about 200 souls. As to the poor coming to Hanesvillehe had received counsel from the First Presidency to streach out his arms and gather all he possible could to Zion and when the Lord told him to do anything or he received counsel through the proper source he went at it with all his might. Hehad laboured hard to gather out the people according to the instruction given him. One company started from Philadelphiaunder Elder Gibson and he himself had started from Boston on the 9th instant with a company of 209 which was increased at St Louis to 225. There are^were^ a fewpoor who had come with him who were not able to go through and if in his zeal to carry out the instruction of the Presidency he had been instrumental in causing moreof the poor to come to Kanseville than ought to have comeit was an error of the head not of the heart.In outfitting the brethren paid from $45 to $80 per yoke for oxen.On the 1st of June my brother-in-lawIllus Carter returned from St Joseph's and had purchased 19 yoke of oxen and two horses for his merchandise train for Salt Lake City.After the usual preparation andlabour of outfitting we commenced to cross the Mo. Riveron the 15th of June and the next day I received instructionsfrom Elder Hyde to organize our company whether they were few or many. I could not organize it in full until I had crossed the river.We camped on Rattlesnake Hill 
 on the 17th but the woods bushes and rattlesnakes made it badfor herding; but Two days later we left and journeyed onward fivemiles where we laid several days.On the 21st I called the camp togetherand organized them as follows:Robert Petty was appointed captain of the HundredLeonard W. Hardy captain of the 1st FiftyEdson Whipple Captain of the Second FiftyJoseph Hall Captain of the First TenJames Currier Captain of the Second TenMiner Atwood Captain of the 3rd TenBrother Gardner Captain of the 4th Ten— Captain of the 5th Ten— Captain of the 6th TenRemarks were made by Wilford Woodruff concserning the order of the camp and regulations for our journey strongly opposing drinking swearing gambling whipping oxen &c.Ilus F. Carter had ten waggons of merchandise and was appointed Captain over them but in consequence of ^illness and^ the lateness of the season he concluded to return home so we made out the report of our organization and sent it by him to Elder Hyde.My brother in law Ilus F Carter left in my possession his train of merchandise which with my own gave me 12 waggons 27 yoke of oxen 30cows teamsters &c under my personal care besides the whole company to care for generally and this affordedplenty of labour and anxiety. Several of the teamsterswere also not bretheren and they were more difficult to manage and during the journey they manifested much of the Spirit of the devil and tried to make disturbancein the Camp. They were gold diggers. Their object was 
 to take advantage of ^our^ situation and compel us to pay higher wagesI told them they might leave and discharged their ringleaderand the rest became more humble; but finally we had to cast them out.On the 28th th Bro. Samuel Smith died of cholera. He was aged 43 and two days later CaptJoseph Hall having drank of slough water freely died after 12 hours sickness. We all felt his loss for he was very useful to the camp.July 1st we dug his grave but 4 men of his company had made a covenant that should any of theirten die on the road they would not bury them the same day and so they remained with the body and the campcontinued and met a company of brethren from the Valley with the mail. Brother ^Robert L^ Campbell had charge of it. We parted from them next day.On the 3rd Matilda Hardy diedand on the 5th Lucy Johnson and two days later MrsSnow and some days later Emily Huntington died. Therewere deaths more or less in all the Camps this season and we passed their newly made graves. ^On the 10th in the PlatteI baptized 14 persons & confirmed them^While our teams were crossing a a Sloughon the 15th th a terrible thunderstorm burst the lightning struck into our midst frightened many persons and cattlekilled 3 oxen and one man ^Brother Ridge from^ dead. He was brother Ridgefrom Lane End Staffordshire. He and his team were killed.StampedeOn the 30th of July the 1st division of our campwas called to pass through one of those scenes so much dreaded by all emigrant companies—namely, a stampede.^of all^ All the oxen with the familiesand waggons of the first division with the exception 
 of the ten baggage waggons which were in the rear s.No person who has not witnessed one of these terrific scenes can form any correct idea of them and it is almostimpossible to give an adequate description of it.Behold 30 or 40 ox teams with from 2 to 5 yoke of cattle in each team attached to a family waggon of goods women and children all in an instant like the twinkling of an eye become frantic all dart off with lightning speed running their own way bellowing rolling and tumbling over each others waggons upsetting smashing their wheels axes and tongues ^spilling^ upsetting the goods women and children for the next teams to trample under feet as they roar and charge along with their yokes bows and chains flying in every direction. Such is a Stampede and the scene is not easily immaginednor described.Our Stamped commenced in the following manner:While my son Wilford was getting on to his horse William Murphy ^struck the horse horse with a whip and^ started ^his^ his horse into a run and Wilford's horse ^was^ flung him over his head onto the ground the saddle ^was turned^ under his ^the horses^ belley and he ran away and as he approached one of the waggons Mr Cannon's team became frantic and started off with great spead In a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the example andthe whole encampment apparantly was rushing into the jaws of Death.I was by my carriage when this commenced. In my carriage which was drawn by a fine black steed were Rhoda Foss and Susan Woodruff and we were at the head of the company.I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the midst of the scene when she was in danger of her life every instant with many other women and children. I told 
 Rhoda to let my horse run into the Bluffs and to do the best she couldand then I gave him a cut to start him into a run and left them to their chance and the care of Providence and rushed into the midst of the Stampede to try to save the life of my wife andas  many others as possible but I had hard work to save my own life.Mrs Woodruff soon found an openingand fled out of the midst of the scene. Brother Petty's two waggons were turned over. My family waggon with 4 yoke of oxen ran over one of his and a waggon ran over one of his children ^+(out)^ Prescott Hardy was knocked down by his own team and badly wounded in the thigh and arm Wherever I saw women or children in danger I did whatI could to rescue them but only little can be done at suchtimes except for each to dodge the best he can and save his or her life if possible.When I found I could do no more for the encampment in general I ran forward to see what state my carriage, family−waggon and family werein. I found my noble horse still running but on three legs. Rhoda was knocked out of thecarriage and Susan was lying flat upon the bottom of the carriage with her feet hanging out between the wheels and she was screaming aloud. I hollowed for her to hold on until I came and she did so untilI caught the horse by the bit and stoped him andrescued my daughter.One of the ox teams had run on to the horse and carriage bent one of the axes smashedone of the horse's legs to pieces and knocked my wife's sister ^niece^ Rhoda out of the carriage.As soon as I got the horse outof the carriage I went through the encampment to see who 
 was killed or maimed; but was astonished to find that no one waskilled and only one badly wounded and but little damage doneeither to the oxen or waggons. It was a miracle that somany escaped. I had to shoot my horse however to puthim out of his misery. This was very painful to mebut I was thankful that my wife children and the companywere preserved so providentially.On the 2nd of August we lost 20head of cattle and I started out on the journey all who were ableto go and the rest of us went out to hunt cattle. I foundthem in the Bluffs and drove them into camp and as themen were out hunting cattle with the assistance of thewomen and children I drove the encampment on andwhen the men returned they found us gone and followedand overtook us.We got along well until we cameto the tremendious bluffs in Ash Hollow. Here myteamsters Watts and Bess both smashed each a hindwheel to pieces and broke every spoke out. I workeduntil eleven o'clock at night to get the broken waggonsinto camp and failing left them by the way sideand walked into Ash Hollow wearied out.The next day was spent insetting tires and mending waggons and the followingday being Sunday we held meeting and I advisedElders Hardy and Petty to go on with the first divisionand I would stop and mend up and keep some ofthe second division with me. This counsel washeard with great surprise by the First Division and theydid not feel to leave me but after much reluctancethe next day they left me behind according to mycounsel and journeyed onward.After 2 days tarry setting 80 tires 
 putting new spokes into two wheels making new tongues &c westarted on and camped with brother Whipple who went the daybefore. We then made two divisions of our companyand Elders Whipple and Gardner were organized with me.The 3rd Division had 26 waggons and the 2nd 18. We madethis division to forward us on our journeyAfter the usual toilsome journey hunting oflost cattle dying of cattle incidents with the Indians &c we nearedGreat Salt Lake City on the 14th of October. I drove into theCity at the head of the company and was glad to gaze oncemore upon the Valley of the Mountains--the New Homeof the Saints. I met with Elder George A Smithand many others and I drove to the two rooms which Ihad made while in the Valley before. President Younghad come out to meet me the day previous but hereturned and I did not see him.The sickness and deaths in ourcompany occurred in the earlier part of the journey whenbesides those named Captains Petty and Hardy werevery ill and myself and family had some little sicknesswith the rest; but on the whole the journey wasperformed with but few casualties of such a journeyand moderate mortality.I set about arranging my affairsand those of the company concerning our stock &c during the first days after our arrival in Salt Lake city.On the 16th I met in councilwith Presidents Young Kimball and Richards and P.P.Pratt George A. Smith and others. President Youngwas sick in bed. The subject was discussed ofestablishing a trading company to do business forthe Church instead of letting the Gentiles come inand gut the Church. We adjourned until next day. 
 I met in council with the Presidency and Twelveaccording to adjournment and it was thought best for me to open thegoods with Heywood and Walley.On the 19th I moved my log cabins fromthe old Fort on to my lot joining the Temple-BlockNext day was Sunday and I metwith the Saints in the Bowery and was called upon to addressthe meeting. I spoke of my mission to the East and relateda dream. I dreamt of dying and going to the place ofdeparted spirits. I saw brothers Joseph and Hyrum Smithand many of the Saints who had died. They all appearedto be in a hurry and I thought it strange to find themso. I enquired the cause and was informed that thetime was set for Christ to come as the great Bridegroomand they had not time to prepare as those in other dispensationsand they had to be in a hurry in order to get ready.Next Sunday George A Smithaddress the meeting upon the words of Saul when he returnedfrom battle, "Obedience is better than sacrifice. [##1 Samuel 15:22##] He spokemuch upon the subject of tithing and was followed byPresident Young who told the people the consequences ofneglecting this duty.I met in council with the Presidencyin the upper room and had prayers before the Lord andI read to them the speech of Mr Copway the Indian Chiefand also the views of Col. Kane upon the Government ofDeseret which I had recorded in my daily journal.The Presidency on reconsidering theaffairs which I had to settle for my brother-in-law Ilus Carterthought it wise for me to sell out his merchandize myselfand so I commenced to sell on the Monday morning andthe people crowded hard around my waggon to buy suggarcoffee &c as they had not had a supply in the Valley. 
 I attended the funeral of Elder Joseph Strattonnext day and Elder Parley P. Pratt preached his funeral sermon.On the following Sunday I attended meetingwith the Twelve and Presidency and met with the Regency and muchwas said in relation to schools &c.And thus continued the several weeksfollowing attending to my temporal affairs selling out merchandizepreparing for the Winter going to the Kanyon and meetingwith the Presidency and Twelve.On the 4th of December I met with theLegislature. Governor Brigham Young had requested meto meet with them and wished me to become a member ofthe Senate.Elected to the SenateDec 5th 1850I met again to day with the Legislature of the Stateof Deseret. The House of Representatives and Senatesat in joint session. As there were two vacanciesin the Senate by the death of Bishop Newel K. Whitneyand Cornelius P. Lott the Governor appointed WilfordWoodruff and Charles C. Rich to fill their places inthe Senate. I was also appointed by the Lieu Governoras Chairman of the Committee on counties in the placeof George A Smith who delivered his farewell addressto the Senate and had taken his departure to actas Chief Justice of Iron County. Many bills cameup to day and passed the Legislature.Sunday the 22nd I attendedmeeting at the Bowery and heard an interesting discoursefrom President Young. His text was truthhis subject salvation his circuit the worldHe said we see the child seeking the knife fork 
 poison raisor or something to hurt itself with: so with many ofthe Saints and Elders. They seek for that which isnot good for them and they know it not. Many seekfor things which tend to death and not life. Hespoke of the desire of some to go to the mines theiruse of tobacco and spirits &c.On the last of the year I met withthe Presidency and Council of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Companyand was appointed by the President a member of that bodyand gave bonds to the sum of the thousand dollars for thefaithful performance of my duty as a member of that bodyaccording to the rules governing the Council. AbrahamO. Smoot and Leonard W. Hardy were my bondsmen.Thus ended another year the formerpart of which was occupied on my mission in preparingfor my return to the Valley of the Great Salt Lakeand in gathering up the Saints the middle months inour journey homeward and the latter end of the yearin the necessary business of daily life and preparingfor Winter and in a Ministerial and public capacity.Patriarchal BlessingofAphek WoodrufGiven by Patriarch John Smith upon his headDecember the 20th 1850Brother Aphek:Beloved of the Lord—I laymy hands upon thy head in the order of the Priesthood andnotwithstanding thy great age I seal upon thee a father'sblessing.Inasmuch as thou has obeyed the

 On the first of January 1851 I met with the14th Ward of the City of Great Salt Lake to dedicate a newschool house which we had built for the purpose of schoolingour children. Elder Parley P.

Benson Amasa Lyman and WilfordWoodruff.During the day Truman O Angel presentedto the congregation a plan of the Seventies Hall about to bebuilt. There were 30 others ordained to the Seventiesto day.After the General meetings the Presidencyand Twelve met in Council and heard all the ordinancesread over that had been passed during the present Legislatureand next day the Presidency with several of the Twelve startedon a mission to Brownsville.Returning on the 20th from my tripto Cottonwood and elsewhere I learned that some brethren hadarrived from California bringing a mail with them bearingthe news that Brigham Young wasAppointed our Governor. 
 keys were sealed upon the head of Joseph Smith and still remain in theChurch. What are they to accomplish? As the Saints could notbe perfect in former days without the Latter-day Saints neithercan we be perfect without our fathers who have died for manygenerations and those keys of Elijah confered upon the Presidentof the Church are to seal the fathers to their children and the childrento the fathers and to assist in welding the great link connectingevery gospel dispensation.I see the wheat growing in this dispensationripening for the harvest. I see the tares also growing for theburning. I saw too the wheat and tares grow on together:I saw the goats and sheep both go ahead unto the end.The Saints of God are increasing inknowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times better,wiser and advance in knowledge before the end.I have watched the windings and progressof this people and the Spirits that surround them. I have seenmany rise as it were to heaven and in a moment of temptationfall down to hell and loose their hopes of Glory. I know thespirits of men and the invisible spirits that affect men and operateupon them better than I do the faces of men.I want to speak a little upon naturalphilosophy. We sow the grain. It dies—rots in the groundand then it brings forth a hundred fold. The elements whichsurround us produce these effects. If we had a correct knowledgeof the elements and know how to control and seperate them wecould make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus didwhen he fed the multitude. The day will come whenwe can go a journey without taking any food with us. Weshall then have power to make it as we go along."Many other interesting remarks weremade by the President. Amasa Lyman followedAt the close of the meeting President 
 Young invited all the Twelve to come and dine with him. We didso and feasted on a fine large turkey supposed to be the first everkilled and eat in the Valley.Captain Hunt met with us at Dr. Richardsoffice in the evening and made a report of Williams Ranch, saidhe wanted to sell to our people. A company was to beorganized to go down and settle a stake or colony and to purchasethe Ranch.On the 3rd I met with the quorum of theTwelve at Brother Bensons. Elder P. P. Pratt presidedpro. tem. There were present Parley P. Pratt W WoodruffE. T. Benson and Charles C. Rich. The meeting ^opened^ withprayer by Charles C. Rich and Parley P. Pratt thenpresented the Record of the Twelve Apostles which was read to us.This record was since the fillingup of the quorum in the Valley of the Great Salt Lakeand it contained many items of interest.After the Record was read andremarks made it was moved and carried that the Recordof the Twelve Apostles be put into the hands of Wilford Woodruff to be kept by him; and for him record such factsas was necessary.We then appointed a meeting for theTwelve each Monday night.According to adjournnment theLegislature met on the 4th to transact business for theState.An ordinance was passed granting to thecommunity a liberal charter protecting them in their religiousrights.During the passage of this ordiance thegovernor said "We do not want the Church to pass laws to 
 punish crime but only to try members on Church fellowship. If themembers shall transgress the laws of the land turn them over to the laws of the land; but we want to protect the Church in their rights ofworship and so we will every other sect that comes here.When the Kingdoms of this world become theKingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will they all bemembers of the Church of Jesus Christ and obey the Gospel?No not one eighth part of them. No more than a telestialkingdom is a celestial one and they stand in about the samerelation one to the other.If a society of Shaking quakers were tocome here and settle in this Valley and wanted a charter to beprotected in their worship let us give them one and if theythink it right not to marry a woman let them live withoutit and not compel them to it.So if the Latter-day Saints wish to havemore wives than one to live holy and raise up holy seed unto the Lord let them enjoy that privilege.Now the Gentile Christian nationsand Legislatures guard very stricly against putting any lawto do away with whoredoms but they will make it almostdeath for a man to have two wives but they will have asmany whores as they please and they think this is all rightbut for a righteous man to have several wives like AbrahamIsaac and Jacob David and others to raise up holy seed untothe Lord who will keep themselves pure before God they thinkthis is an awful sin. But if I had power I would takeall good virtuous females from all wicked corrupt adulteroushusbands and give them to holy men of God that they mayraise up seed unto the Lord.I have more wives than one. I havemany and I am not ashamed to have it known. Somedeny in the States that we have more wives than one 
 I never deny it. I am perfectly willing that the people of Washington shouldknow that I have more then one wife; and they are pure before the Lordand are approved of in his sight. I have been commanded ofGod to pursue this course."Many other interesting remarks were madeby the Governor.On the 5th the subject of distilling spirits in the Valley was before the Legislature. Many argumentswere brought up on both sides. The Governor thoughtwe should learn to handle and controle all the evils and thatwe ought to be able to controle ardent Spirits.Several days later I went to Toille ToollieValley with Leonard Hardy & Bro Celey upon business of manycattle &c and returned on the 11th and thus I was fromtime to time during the intervals of the more public events ofmy life which I note engaged in attending to my temporalaffairs getting rock from the Kanyon building my house leaving home for various business purposes &c.I was in council with Presidencyand Twelve on Sunday the 16 the and the President said hewas affraid there would be a spirit with Amasa Lymanto build up Williams Ranch and loose sight of this"Remember" he said to brother Rich "if this is the case Ihave seen the bud of it"On the 19th I was with thePresident and others at the Council House preparing a roomfor our Council.I spent the 25th in Council in theuper room of the Council House and we had a good timeMy father Aphek Woodruff was ordained to the office of High Priest under the hands of Heber C. Kimball andWilford Woodrfuff. ^at this time^The first of March came and I 
 was 44 years of age on that day.Sunday was the 2nd of March and ParleyP. Pratt delivered to the assembly his farewell address previousto his leave upon his mission to South America.The Sunday following Jedediah M. Grantspoke well on prayer faith industry and other matters andwas followed by President Kimball.During the intermission President YoungKimball and the Twelve called upon Brother Richards, and his sister,Rhoda lay at the point of death. We administered unto herand President Young said she should live and not die at thistime.In the afternoon President Brigham Youngaddressed the congregation upon the subject of building theTemple Tithing & labour on the public works. He saidif every man was willing to do what was right there wouldbe no need of tithing. He would not be responsible personally for the labours of every man on the public worksIf the people paid their tithing. The wardmen wouldget their pay. If we build Temples publicworks or fit out missionaries to go abroad or feed thepoor it had to be by the tithing of the people.He who spoke to of the merchants andsaid that if they did not get their pay from those whomthey trust they were not to turn round up the Presidencyand Church for it.Last Sessionof theLegislature of the State of DeseretApril 5, 1851On this day the Legislature of the State of 
 Deseret met in joint session for the last time and after closing thebusiness of the day the Assembly was disclosed as a Territorial Governmentwas about to be established.On the 22nd President Young and many othersleft the city to visit the bretheren South, I wote to Bro Kingtonand spent the night with him; and next day prepared myself to go on the journey with Ezra T. Benson. He came alongin the morning and I went with him to A. O. Smoots andjoined Presidents Young and Kimball and we started on our journey.We had in our company 20 waggonsand about 40 men in our visiting trip 250 miles to our Southernbrethren and to comfort their hearts. I thought there were. was a company of the same members who ever left as muchbsuiness to get on a visit as we did.An Account of our Journey South.After we left brother Smoots we crossed themountain into Utah Valley and camped for the night. Thiswas the first time I ever was in Utah Valley. I found itto be a spendid Valley of land.The company went on in the morningand I rode to the Fort on the South West side of the Lakedined with some friends on some fine trout and then rodeto our encampment on the Provo Fort.Next day I rode to Brother Behannanand spent several hours with him at Hobble Creek. I herefound Walker the Utah Chief with his band. This was the first time I ever saw him. I thought him an uglycunning looking chief. 
 Next day I rode with Brother Wells across the battleground where the Indians fought our bretheren with Brother Wells asthe leader of the Saints. He gave me an interesting account ofthe battle.We rode to Peletinck Creek where we metthe or teams who were appointed to go to Iron County. We travelledto Summit Creek and camped for the night.In the evening a meeting was called to organize the Camp. Brother Wells was our captainBrigham Young President and H. C. Kimball W. WoodruffE. T. Benes Benson and Joseph Young Councillors.President Young while speaking of the ressurection said that we should receive the same bodies that we lay down even if our chest was blown to the fourwindsof heaven.When we came in sight of San PeteSettlement three days later we were saluted by the fireing of cannon and waving of flags. We were receieved withmuch warmth by Father Morely and the people in generalThere were at this time about one hundred families inSan Pete. They were farming had a school house and had commenced a Council House Etc.I called upon Brother Brown CaptainJones and other friends.We held a meeting in the evening andBrigham Young addressed the people. His belief  ^It was his belief^ that the earth would not have produced for the Gentiles as ithad done for us and if we had faith and power with Godto have the curse taken off; as well as ^instead of^ the sage bush anduseless shrubs, we should have the apple pear peachgrape and every good fruit, but if this people do not takea different course from what they do in some things thenblessings will prove a curse." 
 Elders Kimball and Woodruff followed PresidentYoung in remarks to the people.High Council Chosen at San peteApril the 30th 1851We met this day for the purpose of organizing a HighCouncil. There were twelve men chosen and ordained to beHigh Councillors and I were ordianed to be High Priests underthe hands of E. T. Benson and W. Woodruff. The meetingwas then addressed by John and Lorenzo Young and inthe afternoon by W. Woodruff E. T. Benson and J. M. Grant.Next day May the 1st we leftSanpete in the afternoon travelled 10 miles and camped onSouth Creek and next evening we camped on Salt CreekKanyon and on the morrow we went three miles up theCreek to explore it. We visited one mountain of rocksalt pure and clean and the body was more than 40-feet high and so hard it was difficult to cut it with anaxe. We also saw plenty of the quartz rock andissinglass. We rode to the Severe and campedon its banks and shot one deer while it was swimming the Creek.Sunday we crossed the Severe rode 25 miles through sage and camped on Cottonwood wells ^Bro Wells^and explored the other Kanyon but could not get through.Next day we crossed the mountain intoMaryVale and three days later travel and ^with^ a pleasant morningbrought us into a beautiful romantic mountain scenerya gentle breeze and the air clear serene and healthy.But next moring we were metwith a tremendious snow and hail storm in our facesand we suffered much therefrom. We started early 
 before breakfast hoping to get down off the mountain out of the storm,and travelled 25 miles before we stoped to eat. We came in sight ofthe Valley of Little Salt Lake about noon drove down into aCanyon made a fire warmed ourselves took dinner and theredescended into the Valley over a rough road of rock and sagedrove to Red Creek and camped for the night.We had pressed over the worse road for thefew days past that I ever knew waggons to go over for we hadto draw our waggons up and let them down with ropes theroad was so sideling and we had to hold our waggons up tokeep them from turning over.We camped within 4 miles of Ceder Cityand during the evening George A. Smith and two other brethrencome down to see us. We found Red Creek a goodplace for a settlement.We took breakfast next morning and thenstarted for Ceder City and we were met on the way by GeorgeA. Smith and a company of horsement who came out to escort us in. When we arrived we were saluted by thefireing of cannon and the flag of the Stars and StripesWe took up our abode among the brethren in the FortBrother Benson and myself stoped with Bishop Robinson.We found the brethren had done muchsince their arrival in Ceder Valley. They were about 100men had been there ^three^ months had enclosed a fort containing19 acres and 96 rods of ground ploughed and sown about1000 acres with wheat fenced 600 acres of land built asaw mill and had got a Council House up the first story.The next day was Sunday but as it wasa stormy day George A. Smith addressed the people for a shorttime and dismissed them.A company started out on the Mondayto examine the coal and iron but the President and 
 council remained in Fort to hold a council meeting and do such business as was necessary.A meeting was called at 11 o'clock to ascertain theminds of the brethren. It was found that about 30 wished to gohome 15 to get their families and the other 15 to remain atGreat Salt Lake City. Each one made his excuse.President Young then addressed them and said he would express his feelings upon the subject to those whowished to go home."If you were now on a mission to FranceEngland or any other part of the earth preaching the Gospelyou could not sit down and counsel together about goingto get your families or going home until your mission was ended. This is of quite as much importance as preachingthe gospel for the time has now come when it is required ofus to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. Our missionis now to build up stakes of Zion and fill these mountainswith cities and when your mission is ended you are atliberty to go and be free but only do right."When I go on a mission I leave my affairs in the hands of God. If my house fields flockswife or children die in my absense I say Amen to it;if they live and prosper I feel to say Amen to it and thankthe Lord"President Young wished the brethrento finish the fort and secure the grain &c, and to surveythe land so that the brethren who laid the foundationcould have the choice of farms.On the morrow the brethren assembledagain and E. T. Benson addressed them in the morningand in the afternoon the people were addressed byJohn Young J. M. Grant and W. Woodruff and thenPresident Young followed and advised to have the logs 
 so close that arrows could not be shot into the Fort. He wished theboundries of the city to be altered on the charter as there was a mistake,also that the name was to be altered from Cedar city to the indianname Parowan.Next day we rode to Red Creek to seethe country. We had a feast at Brother Baylis house and ourexploring party returned from the coal and iron mines and broughtspecimen and on the following day we rode to Summit Creek where we could view the country 10 miles from theFort South. He concluded to return home on the morrow.On the 16th the day on which we had concludedto return we met the citizens to agree upon electing officersPresident Young said he cared nothing about the feelings of thenation who had driven us out. We should not follow in the path of the political foolery. We should have one candidateand but one as delegate to Congress. We can speak ourfeelings freely here but when we vote let it be for thecandidate of our choice. Should we have two candidatesand they have about equal votes the United States would knowwe had appostatized from our faith and union or that wewere trying to decieve them. We shall stand better in theireyes to take our own indipendant course and act unitedly. If we have had one track the Saints will walk on it: ifwe had two tracks there would be plenty of devils to runon them. If we begin right we shall go right weshall go right if we begin wrong we shall go wrongThe United States are afraid of our union and sois all the world.In speaking of the Indians he saidthese Indians are the descendants of the old Gadiantonrobbers who infested the mountains for more thana thousand years.We dined together in the city of 
 Parowan and then left amid the roar of cannon and drove to RedCreek and camped for the night. About 30 of the citizens returnedwith us for Salt Lake City.On the 24th we arrived at Great Salt LakeCity. One hundred horsemen came out to meet us and weentered the city with the roar of cannon saluting our returnOur journey had been 500 miles.Next day was Sunday. The peopleassembled in the Bowery and filled the place and President Youngaddressed the assembly relating our journey over the mountains.The following was deliverd on the next SundaySynopsis of A DiscoursebyPresident Yo YoungDelivered June 1st 1851If a man does right he shall have the Spirit of God toenlighten his mind in all things; yet all men will betried buffeted and tempted more or less in this probation andhe that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteouslyangry he should let it sleep and not show itself untilhe is himself again.A good man may be left to commita gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped the evil. The Lord intended for all men to betried in this life and if you build your faith upon a truefoundation that faith has to be tried.All men have an apportunity ofappearing wise or foolish of governing themselves ormaking their folly manifest.Peter committed a gross error. Had 
 he been in the watchtower he might have turned away in the silenceand not denied his Lord.Many have been tried and turned away fromus at a time when they expected to have gained something by itand in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded andovercome and done evil then their eyes were open to see the consequences.But if it is the privilege of all men to liveso that they can see what each act will amount to either goodor evil how different the prospect would be before of the worldof or even this people if they would live so from what it nowis.I endevour to do right in all things and then leavethe event in the hands of God and am satisfied with the resultIf a man is led or tempted to do a thing therof you do not comprenhend the result of and that result not lead to good then let it alone.During the past week one remarked tome that my observation of last Sunday ought to be made and wasgood but it ought to have been spoken in the right spirit. ButI wish to say that I am satisfied with the power and influencethe Lord has given me. The Lord directs things according to his ^own^ will.I know my feelings and zeal wouldmake my words like a sharp two edged sword so thatthey could seperate the sins from the people that theyshould practise sin no more not to be tempted withit; but this is not the will of God. The people stillmust have their warefare and trial and if the stormsand waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for wehave a good captain at the helm.Some people are very anxious toreprove others while they are wrong themselves and do 
 not know the spirit they are of. They are ready to say, "How do youdo Peter and Judas; Jesus and how do you do Mr. Devil and arevery pious and will go to hell and the whole world will go to hellwith the same spirit.Awake ye Elders of Israel and makeyour calling election, sure lest you go to hell with thewicked. I do not point you to the Sectarian hellwhere devils are tossing you with a pitchfork, in the billowsof hell fire eternally; but go and mingle with the wicked inthe States wrangle & fight with them get their spirit andfeelings and loose the light and spirit of God and you willbegin to feel the true state of the damned.The wicked killed Jesus Christ outof malice and wickedness and they did not know thathis death was to save the world. The Lord turnsmany things for good which the world means forevil.The whole earth is filled with misery sin and wickedness. I could find no worsehell than to be confined among them. I labour forthe welfare of the whole people. I wish my bretherento be a happy free people that their course of life maybe such as to get an eternal and temporal salvationI labour to effect this.There is time and change to all thingsThere has been a code of laws given in former dayswhich was for all people—namely the Gospel of JesusChrist. In the days of Christ the Apostlesand Elders were sent out to preach the gospel and warnthe people. They did so but were then martyred for preaching it and the Saints were killed offthe earth.That time is gone. The change 
 has come; for now the set time has come to favour Zion to buildit up in strength power and glory — to gather Israel to build Jerusalemand Zion to fight for our freedom and liberty.We have sent the Gospel forth and preachedthe Book of Mormon and the ministry of Jesus on this continentin ancient days. Now the time is come to gather Israeland polish them.There is a great excitment in the worldabout slavery; and the Abolitionists are fearful that we shall have the Negro or the Indian as Slaves here. We have a fewwho were prisoners whom we have bought to save their lives. But what will the Abolitionists do? If you owe thema dollar they will jug you up. Neither will they liberate theSlave by buying them and setting them free. The master of Slaves will be damned if they abuse their slaves yet the seedof Ham will be servents until god takes the curse offfrom them.But they are not all the slaves who are in the world. The whole world are slaves to sin andwickedness and passion.I have two blacks. They are as freeas I am. Shall we lay a foundation for Negro slavery?As God forbid; and I forbid. I say let us be free. We willbe rich but we must be rich in faith first or we shall berich in no other way.We must lay a foundation to manufactureour own goods. If we do not we shall be slaves to ourenemies. We must stop living so dependent uponour enemies and foreign markerts or it will make ustrouble. And this people must cease getting intodebt to the merchants for if you will get into debt youshall pay your debts. But I say stop getting intodebt. Let no one come to me and complain that 
 he has got in debt and that the man will sue him and ought to be cut off from the Church for you who get into debt andwont pay your debts are the ones who ought to be cut off fromthe Church.Don't get into debt. Go in the Spring and get the bark off the shrub oaks. There is enough inthis Valley to tan two hundred thousand dollars worth of leather; and here your hides are rolling over the earth andyou are paying 50 cents per pound for leather and youpay the merchants 80 thousand annually for shoes.Instead of persuing this course if you will lay a foundationfor taning leather making cloth and what we want you willbe laying a foundation to build and sustain Zion.I drove sheep to this valley andbrought others and brought a carding machine here tocard wool. Who ^will^ put it up? I have done more tostock this valley than any to man in the placeI want others to do something. Set up the machineryand make the cloth.Is there any woman in this Valleywho will make me a suit of clothes? See if I do not wearthem. What is the spirit of the times in the world?If a woman pays a great price for an article it is consideredvery nice and all want some of the same; but youget a thing cheep and all are ashamed to wear it— youare looked upon with disdain if you do; but if youpay a great price you are very respectableThere are many practices not rightTo see men ride through the street; they go as thoughthey were in a hurry to get to hell. To men of wisdom such things look vain and foolish but tothe world it look glorious and the mark of fellowshipwith them is fine clothing and splendor. 
 I want the Saints to adorn themselves: first theirhearts with faith and grace and then their bodies with the workmanship of their own hands. If it is silk and satin all the betterIt will show your art wisdom and ingenuity in temporalthings.True freindship is not known upon the earth. If it it is not among this people; but the friendshipof this people is the fruits of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.This must continue to improve until they are perfect."In speaking upon the subject of tithingPresident Young thought there had not been $200 paidin cash which there had been paid the merchants incash two hundred thousand and there were then30,000 bushels of wheat due on tithing.He said, "Shall we dispense withtithing? Do you want a building to meet in to workshipGod? We want a Tabernacle and a Temple for our endowments also a tower to hang a bell on and we want to keep building up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. If we do this we do our duty. We have duties to perform and awarefare to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours if wecan gain a victory with ourselves so as to have peace with ourselvesour wives and children we shall do well.Synopsis of a DiscourseDelivered byBrigham YoungJune the 5th 1851"I want to speak such things as are in my heart. Allthat are acquainted with me know that my religion embracesall things that belong to the duties of life 
 The religion I have, embraced all the principles ofpresent future progressive and eternal salvation in every sense of the wordI labour for the salvation of myself and my brethren. I would be gladto speak to thousands even to the whole world if they could hear. Iwould not like to preach in this house to 20 or a hundred persons whenmore than 1000 could get in here and then for 20 or a hundred moreto come and to have to preach from 20 to 50 times to have the peoplelearn when they could learn all together.The President of the Seventies called a seperate meeting to day. I came and dismissed it. What if the TwelveSeventies High Priests Elders Priests Teachers Deacons and Membersshould do the same? There would be bare walls or the house topreach to; and what good would it do? If the Presidency of the Seventies have such important things to lay before the quorums to get them together on Sunday let them come and teach usall.I now want to give counsel in this matterfrom this time forth and forever; Let not the President ofany quorum ever again call a seperate meeting from the publiccongregation unless the President of the church order it.The Seventies should be here and allthe people should be here. Let the Seventies Hall go andall other business when Sunday comes. Let the Seventy of Godcome together and hear the Elders teach. Apply your heartswith wisdom and get it. If I am full of the Spirit Ishall not get any more than I shall want. It is the dutyof all to come here who can come and let The power of eternityrest upon us and you should not be asleep but wideawake.When I contrast the present with the pastsituation of the Saints it gives me a great variety of feelingsboth good and bad joyful and sorowful.I have seen this people waiding through 
 a school of afflictions. They then were prayerful and had faith. Theirtrying situation made them remember the Lord their God; but nowprosperity is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tried in allthings: when prosperity comes some forget God was fat and wide anddo not realize the blessings they are enjoying.Some who are in poverty abroad desire to gather with the Saints. When they arrive and get rich they forgetwhat they have been. Could you see the feelings of thousands who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come here they wouldbe willing to lick up the dust of your feet if they could be hereThey are still with the wicked. Bring them here. They lookupon many who were poor but now rich. They then desireto be rich also. They want gold and will soon be willingto sacrifice the society of the Saints and go to the Gold minesand plunge themselves again into hell as it were from whencethey come to gratify an unlawful desire.Thus it is with many men. Somewant to go to the Platte, to Bear River, to keep a ferryto get gold and wait on wicked ungodly men. Were are theirminds? Like the fool's eyes. I told them I would notwait on the devils for loads of gold. I would rather stayhere and serve the Lord All I want of property is to serve the Lord and build up his kingdom with it.I suppose many of the bretheren andsisters are much tried to think they cannot have all theywant. I will tell you what ^to^ you do. Doall you can to day and let the rest go till tomorrowDo your duty to day and all will be right.What good would it do you tohave 999 years to search and learn the revelations and commandmentsof God if we have no time to carry out one of themIf any men want to get more revelation than they can improve upon they are greedy dogs. 
 It will take twenty years to do the work that Godhas revealed through the mouth of his servant Joseph, whichhe laid out for us to perform before his death, even duringthe last year of his life to say nothing of what he gavebefore.I will tell you your duty. Commandyour minds from everything that is not for you to-dayand sit and worship God not sit and sleep. Worship theLord to-day. Go home at the close of the meeting andget your food and rest, then come to meeting againponder and reflect upon the course of the Lord Jesus Christ and his sufferings. If there is anythingnecessary to be done do it and if an ox or an assfalls into the pit pull him out; drive any beastout of your neighbour's grain and put up the fence.Do you meditate? Do youpray in your families, and in secret to get the Spiritof God?You say you have your trials? Ihave mine. I will tell some of them. Brethrenwill come here to meeting; on Monday morning gothrough my field leaving my fence down and let theircattle and horses eat my wheat, borrow my cart waggonshovel hoe and everything I have got and that withoutliberty and never bring it home. If it was notmy duty to stay here I would lay my hands uponsome I could pick out whom I have confidence inand would go and form a colony by ourselves and wouldnot admit of any person who was not proven.I cannot get grass in the bigfield but many of you do it; but I now warn younot to steal any of my wood nor any of myproperty for if you continue to do it I will put 
 a mark upon such men that they will carry all the days of theirlives. They are hypocrits and think all others are thesame. I dont love them very well.Again I say to you, it is not yourduty to get in debt to those merchants. I say youshall pay your debts. If you say you cant pay, I sayyou shall pay them.I speak of the faults of my brethrenYou may ask shall we forgive our brother his trespassesif he repents? I say yes. How many times?Until seventy times seven in one day if he repentsand asks for it, even all sins except the sin againstthe Holy Ghost.If you will bring back my toolsgrass grain or any of my property which you havetaken unlawfully and ask forgiveness I will forgive you. I will not cast off any man untilhe casts himself off. I will not reject any manuntil he rejects himself. I will hold on to anyman as long as he has any prospect of salvationAn AddressDelivered byPresident Brigham YoungJune 15th 1851I would like to say enough in few words to fillthree sermons. I have to deliver my discoursesin few words. 
 I wish the people to sustain the Priesthood asthe Priesthood. As to the opinion of man concerning myselfas a man I care no more about than I do the dust under myfeet. I dont care what you say about me, if youwill only serve the Lord our God.Do this people live so as to knowthe voice of the Good Shepherd? I wish to state oneitem here which concerns you seriously. That is conceringthe Indians here. They are ignorant have been taughtto steal and kill from their childhood and those who coulddo the most of it were considered the greatest Braves andChiefs. As soon as they begin to steal heremany of you want them killed and compare their circumstance with your own. You are taughtfrom your cradle not to steal or kill as it is a greatcrime. Now do you kill a white as soon as he steals? Weigh the subject well.Those who wish them killed for stealinga horse reduce themsevles far below the Indian. You lovethem as well as I do but when the curse is taken off theywill again be fit for society; but while they are in theirdependant state it rests with as to use wisdom and judgementin their behalf.I say to the saints kill every whiteman you see stealing and not kill the Indian for it forthe white man know better.I speak to the Saints not as Governer of Utah; but you and I are sent to save Israel not to kill them.Every Elder that crosses a certainline I do not wish to see him; but those who doright or seek to do right if they commit an errorwe will forgive them. 
 I do not ask for influence only what God givesme; neither will I give any man influence only what the Lord and his own good conduct gives him; for if God doesnot give a man influence all else will be of no use to him.If I do the work of God all is well butI will give no man influence only what God gives.A few words to families who have not a head to govern. They will be destroyed. The man is the head of the family and should govern it. The hand may sayto the head if I really thought you would govern right I wouldbe governed by you; but I am afriad you will not; andI want to govern you and dictate the head. Then theshoulders and stomach will want to dictate. But doesnot good sense tell you that your head should governyour body? Your experience teaches the sameYour head didctates you what to do and when your headdictates your body wickedly and polutes the body thenthe head should be cut off so das not to polute thebody any longer.George A. Smith remarked thatthere wasere some bodies who could not act unless the bellytold the head what to do. In the strict sense ofthe wordIn the strick sense of the word no manis quallified to judge and rule until he is qualified to rulehimself and he king over himself.It is thus in families. Childrenand mothers have you a good husband and father?Let the wife rule the husband and she will keep himtied to the dish cloth and kitchen all the days ofhis life and it proves a curse upon himThere is a curse upon man that Iwould not take off if I could for in the experienceyou have you are led to salvation through our Lord 
 Jesus ChristDo you know your calling matters? It isyour duty to brace up your feelings as men have to do and bemistresses of your house.I go to the house to rest. The mothersays I cannot govern the children; I wish you would; butthis is not right. The Elders of this Church have to goabroad to preach the gospel. They cannot be with thier children. When they come home to spend a littletime they want to dandle their children upon their kneeand not go to whipping them.The mothers should govern themuntil the sons go with their fathers into the field. Thenlet the fathers govern. I can govern my childrenwhen they are with me. I would rather one of mysons to stab me to the heart and kill me dead thanconquer and master me.In government when any undertake to govern out of their place they do not prosper As an example; Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor undertaketo govern and control and set right my affairs at Winter Quarters while I was on a pioneer journeyto the Mountains and they were likely to have destroyedmany; but I said Peace be still and I savedthe people.I say to mothers in the name of the Lord God of Israel do your duty. Dont askthe Father to whip the child. Do it yourself if necessary and let the mothers control their daughtersuntil they go to their husbands.But let the man rule andpreside over his household. And I say to themen do not go home and abuse wives because 
 of what I have said but treat them kindly. What would youthink of a man who would get up before a glass and tear hisown heart out? As well of him as I would of a man whowould beat and abuse his wife."An AddressofPresident Brigham YoungGiven June 22nd 1851If I can see the motives of the heart of manand know eternal things by the Spirit of God it is farmore beautiful than to hear the words of menShould an angel come and conversewith any man in the congregation no other one mightknow it. He would think the person spoke tohim as one speaks to another face to face when theangel would not be seen at all only by the Spirit ofGod or by vision.We may know by the Spirit of Godwhat is in a mans heart before he speaks. Atall times listen to the still small voice of the Spiritof God and it will save the Saints from manysnares.If you get angry dont sin nor letthe siun go down upon your wrath. I do notexpect to see perfection in man, not what theworld calls perfection. I have seen a perfectPeophet and perfect Apostles: that is perfect in 
 their calling; but not the perfection the world looks for. If Josephhad been as perfect as the people wished him to be he couldnot have lived with the people nor stayed this side ofthe veil as long as he did. We could not have heard his voice nor have seen his face: he would have been veiled.Israel could not endure the face of Moses at times.The Lord expects us to be in thepath of duty. When we get in eternity we shall beangels or Gods. We shall there advance to the Godheadif we do right.In speaking of the law, what a simple thing it is? What is the law to those whodo right? It is not made for anybody but thetransgresser and the lawless and wicked. If we donot infringe upon the rights of others all things are oursin heaven and earth, time and eternity; life and deathbecause earth and hell and all that is therein is ours.If we do not infringe upon the rights of any other beingwe shall become Gods and fill immensity as ourFather in Heaven does.I can weigh all the sleepers philosophersand learned men of the earth in a scale and know just whatthey weigh and can circumscribe them all.All is mine: heaven earth and hell, —wives, children; and I am Christ's and Christ is God's.It is not known to us where thestakes are set to God's immensity. Take the worldat large. Can they get to the end of their chain whenthey get to the mill pond?It is a startling idea ^to think^ that we areworshiping a God who was once in the situation that weare in ourselves. They had to pass through aprobation of pain suffering and the fall like ourselves 
 and be made perfect through suffering. The Son of God passedthrough it and the Father would not require of a Son what he wouldnot do himself.All our sufferings will exalt us in the presenceof God if we endure them patiently.A word of advice concering leaving. I never want to hear of another law-suit among the bretheren.Is it anything but good common sense to never have anothersuit before a Judge to say nothing of revelation? It does notrequire any great perfection to accomplish this. Let men doright. Do your neighbour good not evil.The Lord will burn up the earth andclense it as you would an old pipe.You think it hard to have to water yourland here but it is far more healthy than to have rain. It was so in Egypt. If It did not rain more in Illinois andMissouri that it does here it would be far more healthy there. This could be reasoned upon natural principles.A word more upon lawsuits. There would not be a lawsuit in this Valley if all men woulddo right and were Saints; but the net has gathered allkinds good bad and worse. Let twelve men getdrunk in this community and it ruins the place in theestimation of good men. We have to bear the characterof drunkness and a few stinking fish in the net defileit and the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudiceagainst it.Those who were acquainted with Josephknow that if he dealt any in temporal things it createda prejudice against him. He bought many goodsto help carry on the public works but the peoplewere ready to get it all away from him. So itis now but I say unto all men who are Saints 
 put to your hands and help build up Zion and the Kingdom ofGod. We are scholars in the great school and must learnWe are a Kingdom and must bring the Kingdom in subjection tothe will of God.An AddressDelivered by President Brigham YoungJune 29, 1851.I join in testimony with the brethren, I wish to be a doerof the word. I feel the importance of the last speaker BrotherSpencer.Those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroomwill not be invited to the supper; and the time is near.Jesus Christ is an example to all SaintsHe was filled with wisdom in his youth; but in his childhoodand infancy he was like other children. It has been said that he was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the caseHe was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome byit.If we have become acquainted with our follieslet us put them away and apply our hearts to wisdom. Let us have compassion on others as we wish God to have compassionon us.We should increase in wisdom until the dayof perfection. ^out^ Apply your hearts to wisdom and it will producepeace health wealth and every good thing.Should you see a people carry outthe principles of wisdom, peace would be the fruit and you wouldnever see contention unto the day of your death. Ask the world if they do not like a people who live in peace and are 
 contelnted and they will say, Yes; it is beautiful.Take the world of the present day time; and theyare like wolves and eat each other up. They fight and contendand devour each other. The Abolitionists become heated and saythe negro must be made equal to the white man at the table andall other places. They will at the same time turn awaythe widow and orphan and put into prison a poor man for debt^out^ Instead of this we should feed the hungry and do good to all menas we have an opportunity. Then we have a Zion. His peace in the heart.We should bear an evil from a friend as wellas our enemy. You ask the Lord to bear with yourinfirmities so we should bear with each other.What is the necessity of doing wrong having law suits and contending with each other. Go to law andspend $100 to collect $5.You may be told you are indipendantand have rights. You have a right to do good and not evil. TheGod I serve will deal out good to his Saints and everythingthat is necessary for them and reveal his will unto them andteach them what to do. He will not lie or deceive me. I will ask O Lord, did you do this or that? Did you blessthis man or that man so and so or did you suffer that evil?Yes I have done this to try men. Do you want me to doso and so?If I am going to do a thing I ask is itthe will of God? If I cannot get the will of God uponit I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong.We want to do right: then we prosperIs the people doing right? Is the Kingdom growing?Are there principles in this Kin^g^dom to govern all mankindwith?All that the nations of the earth now possess 
 would not make this people happy as they now are. Give usthe Kingdom of God instead of the glories of the world.There has been a great stir to exalt thenegro and make him equal to the white man but there is a curseupon the seed of Cain and all hell cannot wipe it out and itcannot be taken off until God takes it off.When a A person unlawfully seeks for power andexaltation by taking the blessings which belong to anotherHe he will sink far below the other. As Lucifer the Son of theMorning sought the glory that belong to Christ the First Bornand was thrust down to hell so Cain sought Abel's blessingand took the life of his brother. The consequence wasCain was cursed and his seed and this curse will remainuntil Abel's posterity will get all the blessing there is for himThen the curse may be taken from Cain or his posterity willbut his posterity will be below Abel's. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]All are slaves. Polititions are the worse slaves. And if we dont do right we too shallcatch the lash. We are the freest people on the earthQueen Victoria is a slave. She had to ask the liberty to marry Prince Albert; but we are free. We have the right, God and his Kingdom.Let us not dishonor God his Kingdom or our brethren. If we dishonour our brethren we shallsink below them and their children. If the wife dishonourher husband the children will dishonour the mother and she must welter under it.Honour the Priesthood in all its partsbe more faithful be more prudent. Administer to thewants of all as far as you can."Other remarks were made by thespeaker. 
 Fourth of July 1851In ^the^ celebration of the Indipendance of America the cityof the Great Salt Lake poured forth her inhabitants in goodorder with her "Legion" of military ^men^ as an escort to the Governerand citizens.The procession organized at the Temple squareat 9 o'clock in the morning to take a ride to the Great SaltLake. There were about 140 carriages and waggonsbesides the horsemen. The car containing the band ofmusicians was drawn by 16 mules.We arrived at the ^Black^ rock on the Lakeat 2 o'clock. We held a meeting were addressed byGovernor Young and several orators who spoke much to theedification of the people. In the evening manywent into the Salt Lake to bathe. at 10 o'clock the if signalwas given for prayers when all assembled within the corrallprayers were offered up & the encampment retired to rest.It was as pleasant a Fourth of July asI ever spent and my family was with me. Next daywe returned to Great Salt Lake City.DiscourseDelivered byPresident Birgham YoungSunday July 6 1851We get good from all men who speak by the Spirit of 
 God according to their calling. I speak freely; so may allmen. If we speak incorrectly we shall be corrected. We want tospeak freely that we may gather good whether it is in the past presentor to come.Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professesto be a scholar; I do not, but he has murdered the English languageto day. I want speakers to speak the English languagecorrectly for our childrens sake.As to principles there are no principlesin heaven earth or hell but what the Saints have to applyin their prayer place.If we could understand all things we should know that here is the place to begin to make the peoplehappy. If we could understand the dealings and Providenceof God with us and the object of it there would not be thediscontent and murmuring of the people that there now isbut we should have peace and joy and contentment concerningspiritual and temporal things.I would say that temporal andspiritual things are one; but what we call temporal are thecoarser things which we see with our eyes but the finer orspiritual things we cannot see with our eyes unless They aretouched by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritualthings.To say the spiritual eye cannot see temporalthings is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put outtheir own eyes to spite their neighbours.Anciently God angels and eternal thingswere considered natural. My mind can see manythings when clothed with the Spirit of God that myeyes cannot.In speaking of hell it is called veryhot but our God is a consuming fire. Hell is here. 
 It is said the Devil was cast down to the earth; also that he was castdown to hell. He is in our midst striving to lead captive thechildren of man.I want the brethren to speak freely, to speakall that is in them and if they have an error let it out and exchangeit for true principle.Some of the Saints want more revelationmysteries, great things; but do they know what they ask foror what they have already got. If the request of many menwere granted it would be like casting pearls before swine.They would trample them in the mire.We have enough now of the Key words andtokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world andlead us to the throne of God and what more do you want?Have you ever pondered in your heartsby visions and the Spirits of God eternal things even theredeeming of all worlds and from them down to the smallestthings God has made? Have you ever reflected uponthe great system of salvation of the creatures of God?Is man contented? He is not.Can man alter the decrees of God concering the seed of Abraham or anything else? He cannot. Why notquarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father?When the Father appointed Jesus Christthe First Born to come and redeem the earth there wascontention got up. ^The second Brother^ Lucifer the Son of the Morningwanted the honour to come and redeem the earth; butChrist was the appointed one. It was his right byappointment and birthright; but the war and contentionbecame so hot and the influence of Lucifer was so greatthat he got one third part of the host of heaven to join hisstandard; and when he was hurled down to hell likelightning from heaven, one One third was cast down 
 with him. Where is he and those spirits that were cast down withhim? They are here on the earth and have blinded the childrenof men and who are still seeking to overthrow the Kingdom of Godbut this is all rightBut thisis all right and we should be contented with what God sees fitto grant unto us and be contented with our lot. If the devilhad been contented and acted in his place he would not havebeen thrust down to hell.Any man who seeks to do a thing hecannot do and should not do is cast into hell: it makes a hell for him. When a man asks for a things of thatdoes not belong to him it makes him unhappy; but do whatGod wants you to do and wait on those who are above youand all will be right.Why did not one of the Apostles quarrel with Jesus Christ to redeem the world? Jesus set a littlechild in their midst and said if ye do not become as thislittle child you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.If you would be the greatest man in the Kingdom of God you must be the greatest servant. Youwill do more than any other man.The Apostles did not quarrel to knowwho should or should not be President. Why do I or younot quarrel because we were not Joseph Smith?To want to, and cannot is hell! Neverseek to do a thing you cannot accomplish. Every man has[h]is lot appointed him and he should be contented with itThere is the work of God ^angels^ men and Devils.Is the Bible good? and the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants? Yes they aregood. Those books contain the works of God angels men and devils; and if you dont want to be in hellall the time be content with your lot. If you dont learn 
 to be contented with your lot ^you will^ in hell with brother Kempton who says hewas in hell one year.Then learn to be content and you will be happyDont complain about you are not God Jesus Christ an angel JosephBrigham a man a woman ^a brother a mother^ a son a daughter or anything else; butbe content with the lot in which God has placed you: there youwill be happy and blessed.The blacks cannot take the curse off themselvesuntil God takes it off. So the Lamanites are cursed but isthere and blessings for them? Yes the same as there is for theSaints for Joseph Brigham and Jesus Christ and all ^faithful^ men andwomen in their time and season. So be content."Among the remarks of the President the next Sundayhe said,"Why should we not know our own talents and abilitiesas well as others? If we do not there is something lackingConcerning singing there are some men who know sound and^others^ those who do not and those who do not, ought not to sing. We shouldact upon what we know and let the rest go."Upon the remark of Sherwood that he thoughtwe were kicked out of the frying pan into the fire" thePresident said we were kicked out of the fire into the middleof the floor. When people get their eyes open to see thattheir interest lies in the building up of the Kingdom of Godthen the Kingdom of God will roll on and the people will do better.I spent the next day in council andheard two letters read from our friends Col. KaneSynopsisof 
 A Discourse Delivered byPresident Brigham YoungJuly the 20th 1851Brother Kempton was very anxious to preach from thetext Abraham's bosom. Liberty was granted him andPresident Young followed and said:"Bro Kempton has had his liberty asis given to every man who speaks here. He has notsatisficed his mind at all. He may have much in hismind but can say but little here. He is not able to handle the Scriptures and know all the spirtis inthe world as some can.When the dark sayings in the Scriptures are understood they are plain. TheScritpures here that speaks of Abraham's bosom is not asgiven by brother Kempton. Abraham is in Paradise. Lazarus is with him.For me to explain is to tell the truthA man that feels and talks to the people should be a Bibleof himself. If a man that teaches and leads the peopleis not filled with truth so as to be able to teach the peoplewithout quoting the teachings of others altogether, then he isa blind guide and will go to help with those he leads.It is the intention of the Lord to teachman principle in progression until he shall know all things;that he may rise through faith power and victory until heobtains every good thing, even to rise to be gods, even thesons of God. This blessing we cannot obtain withoutexperience.We should not sin when we are tried, but 
 and tempted, but overcome, which will give us glory honour and eternal life.As fast as I improve upon what I have more willbe given me. The Savior was subject to all that we were fromhis birth to his death. He applied his heart unto wisdom. Weshould do so too. Apply your hearts unto wisdom from day today and you will receive all that he did.If I through out all that is in me what faultsI have will give place for truth and that which is good.I feel to praise the name of God for allthat he has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab's continually.All persons see times when they wish truth topervail. Mormonism is all truth. The Lord has raisedup a Prophet and Seer who brought it forth and established it. Hewas faithful unto death and sealed his testimony with his blood.A certain prophecy says when the Bookof Mormon shall come unto the Gentiles the Jews shall begathered to Jerusalem.All truth is ours in heaven earth and hell.It is all truth we want. But does the Church or Elders wantcorrecting? Yes for they have errors and false notions. The net has all kinds of fish. We have some as cursed rascalsamong us as dwell on the earth and we find evil here as well as anywhere else. Yet Zion is here. It is in my heartPeace dwells with me and good principles will prevail hereuntil all evil is overcome even in all the earth.Let no man find fault with his neighboursuntil he is righteous. I dont ask anything of others thatI wont do myself and never find fault with another about anythingyou allow in yourself. Dont you swear scold and do wrongyourself? Then dont find fault with another for it until yousubdue your own passions and the evil that is in yourself.Some will do anything to preside over another when they cannot preside over themselves. 
 Now remeber this that we will have Zion whenall wickedness is gone. We have got to fight, fight, fight, untilwe gain the victory over ourselves. Remeber this and overcomeWhat are the feelings of my heart? It is to bless them ^the people^ anddo them good.July The Twenty Fourth [Figure]1851.The anniversary of the enterance of the Pioneers inthe Valley of the great Salt Lake this day was celebrated withmuch display and enthusiasm by the citizens.At the rising of the Sun the stillness of the morning was broken by the roar of cannon saluting therising Dday. The mammoth carriage of the Nauvoo BrassBand was soon in motion and the band sent forth onthe wings of morning strains of martial and inspiring music. The citizens poured forth from their homesdressed befitting the occasion of a celebration and gatheredtogether a congregation of rejoicing people.The order of the day was kept up bythe firing of cannon 110 times and the procession paradedthe streets. The escort consisted of the Nauvoo BrassBand the Military Band and the Pioneers of '47 theRegency; the Aged Fathers; Young Ladies followed by theMothers in Israel; young girls; young men and youngwomen. The Presidency and the officers of State formedthe escorted party.After the escort came the rear party ofthe procession, 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of the combinedwisdom and strength of the kingdom of God in the last daysThe numerous flags and banners the various emblems of art. 
 agriculture and industry with the music accompanied the procession whichstarted from the President's residence to the Bowery.The burst of feeling in music singing speeches orationstoasts &c during the exercises in the Bowery was truly delightful. "Herewas the power of truth the literature of God's Spirit the eloquence of Apostlesthe laws of the Kingdom of heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in astrange land and the harps hung not upon the willows."The shades of evening come over the city but noaccident had marred the proceedings of the hallowed day nor cursesdrinking rabble or strife.In many respect this day was the most interestingone that had come in my life. My father myself and my childrenmaking three generations of my linage were in the escort.The 1st and 2nd of August I spent HarvestingI had 20 acres of wheat. Five acres of 7 headed wheat yielded from100 to 70 bushels to the acre. The harvest was good this year.Dr. Bernhisal on the Sunday gave an accountof his procdings of Washington and his obtaining a library for Deseret.I spent August the 25th in Council withmy brethren and during it the mail arrived from the States. Itwas 20 days from Indipendance and was the largest up to this dateever received in the Territory being about 1000 lbs.I received three letters one from Ilus Carter one from my brother Azmon and the other from my brotherThompson! My brothers informed me in their lettersofThe Death of My Step-MotherAzubah WoodruffMarch the 20th 1851She died at half past 7 o'clock in the evening. Also Elizabethwife of my brother Azmon died January the 3rd 1851. Theywere own sisters by birth. 
 I found from my brother Azmon's letter thathe was in much sorrow. He was baptized into the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with myself the last of Decemberin 1833. He was ordained an Elder and myself a Teacher withthe hands of Zerah Pulsipher. Elizabeth his wife with theassistance of the Devil made war upon my brother and causedhim to leave the Church. He had been in sorrow ever since.On my arrival home with my letters Icalled my aged Father into the room with me and read himthe letters from his two oldest sons containing the newsof the death of both his own wife and his son's wifeMy father was resigned to the Providence of God.A Special General Conference of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latterday SaintsHeld in the TabernacleGreat Salt Lake CitySept 7th 1851There were present the First Presidency — Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and ofthe quorum of the Twelve Orson Hyde W. Woodruff G. A. Smith and E. T. Benson, the first seven Presidents of the Seventies and the other quorums and a large congregation.President H. C. Kimball arose and saidthe Conference was not for the benefit of one but for the whole"Is the Store House full of wheat? Is the tithing butter and cheesebrought in? Some of you will ask can I get my endowments? 
 But I will say not one of you will get your endowments until you pay yourtithing."President Young arose and said:"As far as you can exercise patienceyou should do so. We are in comfortable circumstances andnow let us sit here and worship God and let our business rest andlet us reflect a little and exercise ourselves on our religion. Letour houses rest and farms and crops and let the people bestill and not talk in the house or about the window.In my meditations I am like other menwho refelct; and I marvel to see men so intent upon objectsthat will soon perish.How many there are here who ask thequestion, "How long will the conference last? I want to go. Icannot stop." While others will be willing to stop andeworship God.Some Spirits are like the troubled sea, weary.If I could have my wish about it, I would wish such spirits topass out of our midst, leave the congregation and let us worshipin peace.We are such an industrious people that wecould not commence conference until Sunday. I care aslittle about our gardens farms lumber &c as you do aboutsnuffing ashes.If you get all the riches of the worldyou cannot hold them. If you will get the wisdom if is your privilege to possess you will know that Godcares more for you than the ravens. If you seek the Kingdom of God and its righteousness the Lord will addall things else that is necessary.Our first duty is to provide for ourfamilies, but we must take a course to accomplish itFools are often rich and the wise in begery. This is the 
 providence of God. We may be ever so rich to day; we may bebeggars to-morrow. This is the case with those who are before meLet me draw the line between the good and the evil. Have you nothad more good than evil? — more than you would have had ifyou had been in the world? More peace than in the world andhappiness in the meditations of the things of God than in the world?Yes you have. Then shame upon the man who complains of his hardships.The worse persecutions of the people are theirbest days. I went to Missouri in 1834, walked 2000 milesin 70 days was so weak I could not step over the fences threefeet high. I now have better health and strength thanever before. I would give all Geauga county for the experienceI have had in six months.Now stay here. Dont go home untilconference ends. Many of the Saints forget Mormonism.Any body who enjoyed the light of the revelations of Jesus Christmust have the Spirit of God. The key to Mormonism is allthe truth in all eternity that ever was revealed or ever willbe that exists with God angels or men. Where shall I goto find truth? In Mormonism. If you get a truthanywhere it is there for that covers all truth.When the light came to me sin did notrevive in me and I died but I revived and lived. I hadnot consented to the death of any good man like Stephenas Paul did. [##Acts 7:56-60##] [##2 Timothy 4:6-8##] But let him come to any of the Churches reared to his name and the world would killhim if they could.I will ask you, are you acceptedof the Father and the Son? You will say I don't know.Well it is because your minds are taken up with thethings of the world. Then let us stay hereuntil we know. 
 I am a Mormon or what is called so and I knowthat Joseph was a Prophet. It was revealed to me long before hisdeath. I always thought while reading the world bible about a Prophet that I would go around the world to see one or any manwho knew things as they were and not have to guess at them.Everything will have to bow to Mormonismor eternal light and truth. We have the true government ofall the earth. I know the path this people has to walk.I am prepared for Mormonism. There has no better manthan Joseph Smith ever lived on earth. Hear it O yeHeavens, O ye Earth and all men: This is my testimonythat he was as good a man as ever lived since Jesus.Thise world will not vote for a manbecause his religion governs. They will not have God governthem, because of their cursed meannesss; but if God didnot or can not deal out justice and rule in righteousness,who can?"E. T. Benson, Orson Hyde, George A.Smith and Wilford Woodruff followed in speeches and thenPresident Young again arose and said:"I read that when the wicked rule thepeople mourn. Ask the world, do the wicked rule?Yes; and they mourn. Do they week a righteous manto rule? No. If the curse has followed the rule ofthe wicked will follow. But let them sleep on andtake their rest; but we understand the Lord has rent theveil, sent angels to us and the Gospel is preached to the poor.The difference between us and the worldis that they say but do not, believe not. We say and both believe and do. The world spend thousandsof dollars to preach the Gospel but do not believe it.When the judgements of God rest uponthe wicked and they are cut off then will be the gleaning 
 of the grapes after the vinetage is done.Let the righteous reign and the righteous willrejoice in the house of Israel. God takes up the isles as a littlething; builds up and pulls down at his pleasure and why are notthe people willing he should reign? Because of their meanness.Some may ask do not good men reign?I will ask a question: Should an angel come to President Filmoreand tell him how to govern ^the nation^ it and he was to tell of it would theynot shut him up in a mad house? And if God was to revealto him truth concerning the people and he was to tell of it thepeople would kill him. This is the situation of thisgovernment—the best on earth. But let the President swaretake the name of God in vain and curse God in all itsforms they willould let him and ^stay with them as^ hail fellows well met.The nation will be damned andgo to hell who killed Joseph: The States of Illinois inconnection with the carthage mob, and the whole governmentsustain it and they will be damned from the President tothe least member.I think no more of a King or Presidentthan of the poorest beggar. The worse scoundrel is themost popular man in the nationThis nation is the first the Gospelwas sent unto. She has killed the prophets that Godsent unto them and their doom will be the neither most hell."Testimony of Willard RichardsTo the Mob at CarthageWillard Richards said"We have had much testimony to dayI will add a few words. When Hyrum Smith fell inCarthage Jail and exclaimed "I am a dead man Joseph fell dead 
 John Taylor fell wounded. I carried him to another part of the jailand covered him up. I walked out before the people and said thatJoseph and Hyrum Smith ^who lies before me slain are two of^ were the best that ever lived. JosephSmith was a Prophet of God and Hyrum a Patriarch. Two bettermen never lived; two better men God never made.""Joseph was a Prophet. Brigham is as greata Prophet and he that believeth it may be saved and he thatbelieveth it not will be damned."Judge Brochus and the People.On Monday morning September the 8th and thesecond day of the conference Judge Brochus requested theprivilege of addressing the people and it was granted him.He arose and commenced his speechby testifying of his kind reception among this people. Hehad been sick among them he said and kindly treated.The flys had been brushed from his face by a lady and hewas thankful.He then refered to the Judiciary and requested the people to sustain it and professed to be verysorry that he was going to leave it. He then referedto a report in circulation that he came here for the purposeof being returned a delegate to Washington and otherthings that were reported against him &c.Next he took up the subject of hisappointment and said that President Filmore had appointed himalthough he was a democrat; and observed that he shouldnot have been appointed had he not been a capable virtous was a good man.He then addressed the ladies upon 
 the subject of the Washington monument and wished them to procure ablock of marble and present it to Washington; also wished them todonate for the building of the monument and talked much aboutWashington and his battles and good deeds.He spoke of the perscecutions of the Saintsconsidered them badly treated, had sent to Winter Quarters whereour dead was burried and had a sprig of myrtle pluckedHe carried it in his bosom. It was now dryed up. Heshowed it to the congregation.In speaking to the ladies he said hehoped they would become a virtueous people. He didnot wish them to send the block of marble unless they could do it in full fellowship with each of the seperateStates composing the United States.He had read something castingreflections upon the United States Government concerningour persecutions; but he would defend the Government aslong as he had a tongue to speak or hand to lift; andsaid the Government could not do anything for us as theyhad no power; but if we wanted redress of our wrongsapply to Missouri and Illinois where we had receivedthem.This part of Brochus speech stirred theblood of the whole congregation; and much more was said by him calculated to arrouse the indignation andwrath of the people.President Young's Reply.President Young arose and said that Judge Brochus waseither profoundly ignorant or wilfully wicked in presentingsome sentiments which he had to the assembly thatday. How he supposed for a moment that Brochus 
 was going to throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religiousmeeting and presented such sentiments as he had he should not fora moment have given his consent to the Judge to speak on thatoccasion. The President said several stood by and wishedto take up the challenge given by Brochus but he would notpermit of it for some might have got their hair pulled if nottheir throats cut and he would not have it.The President then wished the meeting toadjourn and the assembly to meet again in the Conference andtransact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meetinghad been called. Meeting adjourned for one hour.After the adjournment following previous speakersHeber C. Kimball spoke. He said "I will tell one tell onething that will have a great effect upon us and remove themist. When we come to the house of the Lord bringan offering to the Lord. I will make an offering tothe Lord and the Priesthood as Abraham did to MelchezedicAnd offer the best you have.  Did not this law comefrom Joseph who was ordained under the hands of Peter?  BrighamYoung was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keysof the Kingdom of God. If you strive against him youstrive against God who sent him."After Brother Heber had spoken PresidentYoung then arose and said:"I will speak of principle. You maythink it is a novel Conference. How long has it ^been^ sincewe have had the privilege of spending a Conference undisturbed?A long time.I would like to hear brother Kemptonspeak or any good man. I will preach brother Abbot's funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all the faithful. His body is laid in the dust to rest until the resurrection. For ever blessed is the man 
 September 1851who lives and dies a Saint.I will tell whether the messenger sent to brotherKempton was of God or the Devil. If the messenger wasnot of God he would know it. If the messenger was anywhereelse but here he must have come from heaven or from anotherhell for we are in hellGo to the world and preach the Gospel.You will find some people as honest and good as angels as faras they know; but do they have revelations from God and knowthe things of God. No they do not. If brother Kemptonhas had his sins forgiven and remitted without baptism socould all men. But this is false. No man couldhave forgiveness without the sheding of blood and baptism.The Bible says unless you Keep the commandments youcannot be saved.When brother Kempton says he knowshis sins were forgiven before he was baptized he knowsnot what he says. At times the Spirit of God isgiven to men to see the Kingdom of God and they thinkthey are in it when they have not entered the door of baptism.Dont go and tell the different denominationthat because their sins are not forgiven that they are alwaysgoing to dwell in hell for if they are honest they will havea glory greater than many who carry the Gospel to man.There is a good people among all sectsGentiles Jews and Heathen as there is on earth. Theyact according to the best light they have.What is the condition of this governmentLight has come into the world and men love darkness ratherthan light. They rejected that light fight the Prophets and shed their blood. For this theyare damned." 
 September 1851.In the afternoon the officers of the church was presented and then President Young said."I want to establish some travelling Bishops, a thingwhich we never have done. When I approach the subject ofBishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to taketime and look at it all day until we can see clearer than we nowdo. This people stick to the world love the world. Weshould use the world not worship it. No man is freeindeed until he is free in Christ and above the world. Don'tworship the world. You will not be free. Is there anyone that has anything but what God gave him. You cannotmake one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to feed clothe and sustain the families of those who are inthe vineyard preaching. If we let them suffer and they die theirblood will be required at our hands. We as a people have neverdone it ^yet^;  but it is time it were done. The Bishops are reprovedThey dont do their duty."John Banks and N. H. Felt were ordained Travelling BishopsE. T. Benson, J. M. Grant and Orson Hyde were set apartto go back to Kanesville and gather out all the Saints in thatregion.  Samuel Richards was appointed to go to England andalso Willard Snow and A. O. Smoot; D. Carnes to Germanyand Dorr P. Curtis and Venson Shirtliff on a foreign missionand Dr. Dunyan to the Eastern States.John Smith the Patriarch said he hadbeen in the work since Jan 1832 and was about the oldestman here. "I was ordained an Elder under the hands of Joseph Wakefield. The Smith family was chosen tobring forth this work. My team halled the first loadof stone to build the Kirtland Temple. My son GeorgeA. drove the teem. There were four brothers of usin the stand inKirtland. I am now left aloneI was in jail with my nephews Joseph and Hyrum the 
 September 1851night before they were killed. Next day three guns were snaped at me. I could not weep for a long time. When I did weep Iwept much. I have laboured much from that day until this tokeep things right. It is said that it is the little foxes that spoilthe vines. We have a Prophet for a leader. Now pay yourtithing and make good measure when you sell anything, and fulfilall your covenants if they are made right. We shall then prosperin this Valley. I am an old man and cannot say muchbut I will write a piece to be published in the paper."H. C. Kimball said "I am going to makean offering to President Young. Abraham paid tithes toMichezedick. A certain woman gave a purse others filled it. Brother Rhodes gave sixty four pounds of gold forthe public works. He has not lacked anything. Youshould give the best you have to the Lord. He willpour you out a blessing that there will not be roomenough to receive it."After others had spoken President Youngsaid"I will put the motion, will the sisters vote to quitusing tea and coffee? The brethren have voted not touse tobacco.I will speak of the Bishops. I spoke ofthem Yesterday and reproved them sharply. Somewanted me to offer an apology to them. I will not.I will see them in hell before I will do it. If this peopledo not do better than the Bishops have they will andif you do not do better than you have done you will go to hell.I will begin with myself. I havetaught the Bishops principle and their duty. Askthem if they can do it. No. I will cut the Bishopsoff from the church if they do not do better. Did I 
 September 1851.ever council them wrong. You have trampled my counselunder foot. I shall not shrink from duty.I say to all old and young learn to prayPray in your families. Be content in all circumstanceswhere the Lord shall place you.; cease your contentionsone with another; never go to law; gather your famliestogether and pray for me and my brethren and yourselves untila blessing rests on us."Others spoke and then President Young againduring the day. He said he wished to say a few words to the Mormon Battalion."Those who are wanting their extra pay areapplying to Williams Blair and Babbit. If you apply tothose men and give them the papers and they cheat you outof it dont complain and I say to those men not to takeany papers from those fwho have had their pay or soldtheir claims to others. If you want your pay applyhere and you can get it.You did not enlist to get $8 per monthThey enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentimentswe are accused of treason. I dont ask any odds of the United States. I will express my feelings. To driveus from our mullions and our possessions ^and then require us to fight their battles^ is not right.I shall pay my tithing. The Twelvewill pay one tenth of their possessions and the Bishops andall will pay their tithing.This is the Kingdom of God and if itfalls I am willing to fall with it. I would rather fallthan stand if the Priesthood falls."All the people covenanted to pay theirtithing and Bishop Hunter and others spoke. Upon theremarks of Elder John Banks upon the law of libertyPresident Young said: 
 September: 1851. OctoberThe liberty of the holy Gospel is peace and righteousnessWe have no liberty to take away another man's rights; but thefirst principle of liberty is resignation and submission for gowhere you will to heaven or hell you have to submit to lawsWe are at liberty to adopt every holy principle to all eternity.Go East West North or South. Keepeverything ^you want for^yourselfves wife children houses and cattle and createout of the elements everything you can; Yet you are not at libertyto infringe upon the rights of man.You may have the privilege todo all things that is done in heaven. Organize the elementsgive commands and rule over Kingdoms but be subject tosuch laws as you are under. The law of liberty is todo right for God to all eternity. The opposite principleis to be discontented with things: to be different from whatthey are. This is hell and all the hell there is.I dont care how things are if I do right. We shall find the law of liberty tobe eternal life light and peace which will increase toall eternity.We ought not to do an evil to causepain to any creature; still there are some things whichappear to be evil that I know to be good.God will increase his Kingdom toall eternity. Abrahams seed will reign as kings ofkings and lords of lords and to his seed there is no end.Let this people live and do rightand the blessing of God will attend you to alleternity.The Conference was adjourned to the6th of October 1851.October the 5th was Sunday theday before the Conference. In the morning Elder O Pratt 
 October 1851.and George A Smith preached and in the afternoon the Presidentspoke: the following is a synopsis ofAn AddressDelivered byBrigham YoungOctober 5th 1851.We hear the brethren arise and return thanks for theblessings received. We can respond to it. The work isof all importance to the human family. The brethren are allwilling to do right; and they say Lord not my will but thinebe done. If the Lord should say come and preach to us wewould say Amen to it.The Lord has his means to carry on hiswork and also his own means to do it. When the people'shearts are prepared to do the will of God the victory is ours.If we come to understanding so as to have the organization of the Kingdom so that every one willact in unison like a beautiful piece of machinery we gainthe victory. We shall then know how to order our speaechand converstaion aright before God.This is a good people. Cannot webe better? We have faith and knowledge. Cannot wehave more of it? Yes there is an eternity of it.We have learned to obey by the thingswe suffer. But what do we behold? There is evil surmisingspadeaking and doing. The evil intruders hadve not left usWho is keeping the commandment that thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself? We will save his neighboursgarden crops &c. We shall then believe and practise 
 October: 1851.all the commands. We shall have but one common interest. Idont care what you believe if you practise right and as though youloved the Lord and then you will do right.There is no school like your own experianceWhen I heard George A Smith speak I thought of former dayswhen men from Canida and other places would stop 50 milesthis side of Kirtland leave the money with the wife go andsee Joseph say how I love you; but let Joseph ask them fora few dollars and they would immediately dodge at it.While you were in the world youwould go away. Now you are here I cannot get youto go to the fat Vallies because Warsaw and Carthage are notthere. I felt like crying about Amasa's company. Theywere ready to go to hell. How ready the perople are to go tohell! Let the eyes of the Saints be open. I hadto be pleeid pled with Amasa Lyman and company for days notto go. I could not stay them. Now I want youto go and you wont go. I want to have you go toIron County. The people here are so full of wheat and good things that they loathe it. If you dont want to pay your tithing the Lord dont want your tithing until yougo into hell. If you dont want to save yourselvesnor your children nor your dead dont you pay yourtithing; if you do want to save them pay your tithingfor it is for your benefit not mine. You cannotdo the Lord any good in it nor add to his glorybut it is for yourself.The cattle have come in well of lateand I think the best have been sent in. You shouldbe industrious and saving. I do not want anmychildren to be lazy. If I die I do not want anyman to foster them in laziness idleness. I wish my boyshad to work as I did for a living. 
 October 1851General ConferenceOctober the 6thConference assembled according to adjournment.President Young said the time had come to commencethe business of the Semi-Annual Conference. The business ofthe last Conference was productive of more good than any Conferencewe ever held. The keeping of the "Word of Wisdom" has donemuch good. I will be exceedingly glad when we arrive atwisdom in all things.The Word of Wisdom was given in Kirtlandtwenty years ago for the benefit of all Saints. When welive 20 or fifty years longer we shall see that we do notunderstand much of the Word of Wisdom.  We are but babiesin understanding wisdom. Who understands it, were allspoken that might be spoken. There is but one systemof explaining any revelation and that is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the heart of man when he prossesses the Holy Ghost.We are forbidden to eat meat in hotweather. Hot drinks and tobacco is not good for manYou should not eat to over loading your stomach. Thereis a greater lack in my system of wisdom of tempering myfood and ^exercise^ than in eating meat or tobacoo.Tithing is coming in so fast therewill  not be room to receive it.I wanted this Conference to come togetherso that I could see their faces not to scold them. I wantto see the faces of the Saints. They look better to me thanall the glories of the earth. I said when the brethren gotout of prison I wanted o sit and look at them three weeks.Our Graineries and Store House are full 
 October 1851of wheat and good things.If this people are rich beautiful and happy, I am with them; if they are miserable, I am still with themif the people are not all crowned and saved none of us will be.It is in vain for one man to build himselfup and neglect his brother's interest. He will fail in it.We must begin to manufacture all we want orwe are slaves to everything in all the earth.Everything is against Mormonism, and Mormonism is against everything; everything is against us. Hear itO Earth for the Kingdom of God is against all earth and hellThis is true and we shall fight them until the kingdomsof this world become the Kingdoms of our God. We shallfight battle after battle until the victory is won. Wehave to fight and lay down our lives for Christ'ssake.We now want to gather companies togo to the different Valleys. I want the potters to remainhere and work at their business.Jesus descended below all thingsbefore he assended above all things. We have to sacrificeever freely in order to be exalted before God. I oncesaid I will go and build me a house on the hillout of the mud. Joseph said you will stay whereyou are. This was enough. I dodged as quick as I could. I said, Enough. Since I have been willing to be governed by circumstances that have surrounded me and leave the event in the hands ofGod."Judge Snow then spoke and afterwardsthe President said:"At our Conference we appointed Felt andBanks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops and 
 October 1851 Decembercall them to an account and see that they are faithful Bishopsand you should feed the poor and do your duty until the Spiritof God rests upon you and you hold the Keys of the MelchezedickPriesthood and the power of it rest upon you forever."Brothers Banks and Felt were thenordained under the hands of the Presidency.In the afternoon Joseph Young O. Fulmer andZerah Pulsipher ^and Alfred Cordon^ were appointed as missionaries and after a discoursesfrom H. C. Kimball, and from George A. Smith upon the opening of the new settlements President Young closed withan address upon the education of our children. This wasone of the most interesting conferences ever held by this people.President Young's Medical Lecture.Delivered before the Board of HealthAt Great Salt Lake CityDec. 1851"I wish to impart intelligence to the people. My firstproposition is the science of health medicine. The study andpractice of medicine as a science, if it may be called ascience is the most imperfect of any science in existeanceas it is practised by the doctors of the present day. Thedoctors and priests of the day send more to death andhell than anywhere else. About one in a million mayget some glory. A bigger set of cursed scoundralsnever graced the earth than that class. Surgery is adifferent class and is very necessary in many instances andthat system can be learned. But to learn the systemof man they cannot: no more learn that than they canlearn the heavens. 
 A worse set of ignoramuses do not walk the earthThey do not know how to turn wind in a man's body when it getscross ways. If you cut their infernal throats the people willlive. I know what this society is here for. It is toimport what knowledge they have to others. But I have seenthe folly of the doctors even at my own doors. Take them asa whole they are the most damnable set on earth. Their practicesare infamous and their medicines produce death. If the peoplewant to eat calomel let them do it and be damned; but dontfeed it to any of my family. If any doctor does and I knowit I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding arsnicI do not employ such doctors to visit me. I do not employany doctor to visit me.The practice of doctors in visiting womenin childbirth is damnable. Women should be let aloneand let Nature have its perfect work. Let a woman keepher child if she can two or three years but she cannot doit. When the time has come Nature will deliverher of her child without a doctor. Dont fret. Leteverything take it's proper course and sickness willould departaway.The doctors in New Haven ^Ct.^ met by mutualagreement to see how far they could frighten a man and didactually frighten him to death, a robust hearty man.Many things should be said to thispeople. There has not been a doctor baptized intothis church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledgehe is a fool. There is not a physician in the church orin the world ^that is taught from on high by revelation^ but what will acknowledge this to be a truedoctrine: If there is a doctor who can see and knowman from head to foot and know how to care his diseasesby revelation such are the only true and safe doctors on earthAll other are fools. 
 I see medicine ^men die^ in the hands of the doctors. The medicineskill them. Why dont they tell what ails the patient or acknowledgethey dont know. The foolery there is among this class is disgraceful andmakes me mad and the day will come when you will not wonder atmy feelings.You are natural persons and God has made younatural. If you are with child that child will come forth bynature without a doctor. The earth is just so will bringforth of itself seed after its kind.If a person is sick and has not faith to behealed give them herbs the products of the earth and it will careyou, until it is time to die.When a cat is sick she will eat catnip withouta doctor, and she gets well. Nature prompts her to itIf a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the earthand lie in the ground until the poison is gone. So naturewill teach us as well as the cat and dog. When a toad is bitby a spider it will go and eat plantain if it can get it.If a child is to die in being born letit die but dont employ a doctor to kill it. How will yoube instructed? I will tell you what to do. If  you aretaken sick dont be frightened but be calm. If youget a cold let Nature be judge. Disease will go up anddown through the system to find a place to be located.It is as much our duty to know how to cure our system as to feed our body. The doctors wouldsay you are diseased but dont know it. Who made thedoctors? The Devil. The Lord did not make thedoctors of the present day.Such a thing as a man midwife was not known until about the year 1500. Why did notall the women die before this time? Look at the Indiansfor one thousand years. Millions of children have been 
 born in the wilderness male and female and they live and not diewithout a doctor.You may ask what shall we do? I willtell you. I will give you a lesson and I want you toremember it. When you go to visit a woman in travellet her alone until her full time has come. Rememberit and let the mother alone. Let your system benatural. Teach them also to execise all they canthat when they come to be delivered it iwll be betterfor them.A doctor if he had good sense wouldnot wish to visit women in childbirth and if a womanhad good sense she would not wish a man to doctorher on such an occasion.I want you to teach yourchildren the truth principle of birth.  I talk as I dofor the people will not sense anything unless they arehalf knocked down or thunder rolls in their earssoft words will not do. I want you to hearand understand.There has been some difficulty inthis Board of Health. If I had been with you, youwould not have had any difficulty. It has beenthrough misunderstanding. If you understoodprinicple you would not quarrel. You may spreadCalomel on your bread and butter and eat it if youwish but it is as deadly poison as arsinic but notas quick. It is not good. You may ask ifit was ever good in any case? There are caseswhere it might be a benefit; but it would want a revelation to tell when it was.There is not poison in lobelia.I will give 5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz. of 
 poison that can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this Valley.It is not probable that any two persons areorganized just alike in all respects. Then who is a physicianNone, unless he be taught of God and is a prophet or revelatorhe cannot understand the human system know disease andwhat will cure it.I dont care how a man acts if he intendsto act right and when he acts wrong is willing to be righted.We will take the best physician of the day thatlives the closest to the Lord, I dont care how well he ishe will be brought down as a fool, for he will be made tolet God be honouredI have been on a journey in the dust.I have got dust on my brain: that is what ails me. Itwill work off. Could a doctor tell what ails me? No.Can a doctor tell what ails a sick man by feeling of hispulse? No more than he could by feeling of a dogs tail There is no Physician unless he is taught of God.You should learn how to doctor yourselfYou should study your own system. Any people whomust trust to a doctor at all times will die. But trustin God and you will live longer.What a different time it would be if alltrusted in God rather than in the doctors; for 9 out of10 die under the doctors' cure who would live if they trustedin God alone. Dont get frightened and and you will do well enough. It is just as reasonable to send for adoctor to have a calf colt or pig brought forth as it isfor a chlid.After you have received your resurrectedbodies you will bring for Spirits to all eternity who will go to some world and take a tabernacle or body thesame as we have. You dont want a doctor anymore 
 here than there.If the membrs of this society are true eithermale or female they will impart all the useful knowledge theyhave to others. If they are not willing to do this they arecorrupt. If one man knows more than another let him tellhis knowledge and if a man knows more than all the rest lethim be a father unto the people and teach them and not act likea boy. If I hold myself equal I am equal. If I listedmyself superior let me manifest it by doing a better deed and beingsuperior myself.It is the man that rejects light and knowledgewhen shown to him that God condemns and I condemn himSome say we have spiritual wives but I think God has madeus all natural and I think we should be natural."Synopsis of 1851Travels: I travelled with the Presidency and others to ParowanIron County and explored the country from Great SaltLake there.

 faith that the Union of the United States may be preservedinviolate against all the divices of wicked men until truth shallreign triumphant and the glory of Jehovah shall fill the whole earthThen in the name of Jesus ask the Father to bless your food andwhen you have filled the plates of your household partake withthem with rejoicing and thanksgiving; and if you feel to makemerry in your hearts sing a song of thanksgiving and lift upyour hearts continually in  praise and acknowledgement of theunbounded mercies you are momentarily receiving."An AddressByPresident Brigham Young.Jan. 4th 1852.President Young took for his textsubject "Sin and the forgivenessof sin.""I speak upon this subject because we are in themidst of it. It has been among all the elements; it has beenin our houses in our families and in our hearts and althoughit has been our constant companion there are but few whounderstand the nature of sin."Many have made themselves miserableby thinking they had sinned against the Holy Ghost; othersthat they had sinned a great sin. But what have therevelations of the Lord said upon these subjects?"We learn that Jesus Christ came andtook a body and redeemed the world but that Lucifer rebelledand was camst down without any body and he has sought tovex and destroy the children of men. He seeksdiligently to draw all from the right path especially if a Saint tries to follow the track and get where Jesus was 
 then the Devil will try hard to overthrow them.Many have thought they have committed muchsin when they have not understood the nature and works of sinWe must understand many principles and arrive at much knowledgebefore we can ^fully^ understand the nature of sin.The vaieil of darkness is over the earth so thatthe inhabitants of the earth are so overwhelmed in tradition anddarkness they do not know light from darkness truth from errorright from wrong or the difference between the dictation of theHoly Spirit or that conscience which has been framed for themby the dictation of their mothers and Priests. Many thinkfar more of the traditions of their youth than of any principlethat God could reveal unto them. Their mother must notdo anything on Sunday. To darn a stocking wouldbe a great sin.Sin is one thing and tradition another. Theword of God revealed will tell what sin is while tradition willnot.The education of the world is good as far as theyhave any truth found in science which they possess; butthey do not understand truth in connection with the planof salvation.I want the Saints here to understand thatthey cannot sin against God and Jesus Christ and thePriesthood against his ^their^ families and the Saints and then comeand ask forgiveness of the Church then pass on smoothlyand think they will go to heaven. This is too cheep a wayto get to heaven. I want this subject riveted on yourhearts; if it is not you will not remember it.You must remember your covenants andthe law of God that is given to us. It is written that sinis a transgression of the law. Where is the law? In thebooks that is given us in the main; yet this does not go into 
 all the meanderings of life. Where do you find a law thatyou shall not drive a teem across your neighbours lot not go tohis hay stack or suffer your famlies to take liberties thatyou are not willing should be done to you? Yet you knowit to be wrong. But do unto others as you wish others todo unto you is the law and the Prophets.Some men who have been ordainedunto the Priesthood and are very high in authority will takethe name of God in vain and swear by this and that.Does such persons suppose that the Church can forgive thatsin? If you do your hope is in vain. Theycan never forgive that sin?. No man can do it. Nonebut God alone and it never will be forgiven until he does it.The time will come that if a man will take the name of God in vain he will be hewn down withoutjudgement or trial. Hear it O, ye Elders, for it istime. Let this people sanctify their hearts, and thentake the name of God in vain and it will not be forgivenThe time will al[s]o come when the parents are sanctifyedbefore the Lord and their children rise up in disobedienceagainst them and they will be hewn down.If you sin against God and takethe name of God in vain if you get forgiveness you willhave to be forgiven by Him and not from man.Some think if they are alone and swareor sin nobody will know it; but they will find themselvesmistaken. Still if a man has to sware let himbe alone. If a man damns himself let him be alonethat others may not be polluted by his sin.If you take the name of God invain I will not forgive it, for I cannot. If the Lordwill forgive you I will forgive you for maring my feelingsby speaking in my ears. 
 The more you see the veil parted and the more ^you^ welearn the more you will see that God's ways or not as our waysThis people are passing through a great school of experience. I rememberwhile in Kirtland that if any of the brethren felt their rights infringedupon in anywise or abused they would retaliate and be readyto quarrel about it and get up a lawsuit for a debt of three dollarsBut the minds of Saints have become more noble.Now if a man is abused who understandsprinciple he is above quarrelling about it and he feels to sayit is nothing to me: I am not to suffer by it; but you whohave abused me have the penatly to pay. But if the devilcan only make you think that you are abused or ill-treatedand you begin to fret about it and you give the devil powerover you in the end it is as bad as though you had donewrong yourself.Now if a man sins against you untilseventy times seven and he repents and with an humbleheart asks forgiveness you should forgive him for this isthe law. He must ask forgiveness and be honourableor he cannot be forgiven.As much as been said, and manyfears entertained concerning the sin against the Holy GhostI wish to speak farther concerning that subject. Tosin against the Holy Ghost is a sin against God the Fatherthe Son and the Holy Ghost that bearseth witness record of themA man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost until theHoly Ghost has revealled unto him the Father and the Sonand a knowledge of eternal things in a great degree. Whenhe has a knowledge of these things and with his eye openhe rebels against God and defys his power, he sins againstall three. If a man does sin against the Holy Ghost the people have nothing to do with it; for theycannot forgive that sin and none but God can do it, and 
 probably he will not in this world nor in the world to come forthey become sons of pedition and probably will never repent of norhave a disposition to.If you blaspheme the name of God dontask this people to forgive you ^for they cannot do it &c^. If God forgives the sin thenyou can go down into the waters of baptism. When you getknowledge you will be ashamed to sin.Now I want to bring this subject homeWhat are the acts of the people? Do they not sin and trespassagainst their brethren, parents against their children and childrenagainst their parents, the husband against the wife and the wife against the husband? This is with us and this we can reachand manage and tell what ought to be done.You ought to cease from taking theliberty of any person and do unto all as you would wish themto do unto you. Infringe upon the rights of no one; borrowno tool but what you will return according to promise. Takeno wood nor anything else but what belongs to you and ifyou find anything that is not your own do not hide itaway but report it that the owner may be found.If I had some stones here I couldcast them and hit two or three in this congregation in thehead who are guilty of these acts. You may say whydont you tell who they are? Why you poor devil areyou not going to repent of it by and bye? If not whenthe day of clensing and sanctifying of Israel comes youwill have to be sacrificed and your blood spilt uponthe ground; for the day will come when iniquity mustcease in Zion and the profane man who takes the nameof God in vain will be slain.In the days of ancient Israel Justicewas dealt out in a manner that showed they understoodprinciple and revered the commands of God. 
 It was a mercy to many to have justice andjudgement executed upon them on the earth even to be slain and havetheir blood poured out upon the earth that it might be tolerablefor them.God made a covenant with Abraham and his seedthat he would save them. When they committed sin heslew them that he might save them by their sprinkling ^spilling^ theirblood as an offering. Had they had lived in sin they mighthave sinned so as not to have been forgiven or saved. Itwas a mercy to slay them.Now brethren if you sin against Godgo to God to get forgiveness if that sin is not unto death. Thereis a sin unto death which we are told we need not pray for.If you sin against your brother go to him to get forgivenessAsk forgiveness at the hands of the innocent. If you sin against your family your parents your husbandyour wife your child seek forgiveness at their hands; but what is done in secret should be forgiven in secretand go no further that sins may be hid. But ifsins are committed openly they should ask forgivenessand be forgiven openly. These are true principlesand let them be remembered foreverGoverenor Brigham Young's AddressOn SlaveryBefore the Legislative Assembly of UtahThe whole world are slaves. Eve partook ofthe forbidden fruit and also Adam and this actbrought slavery upon all their posterity in some way or 
 other and this will continue in some way or other until we becomerighteous enough to drive the devil and evil from the earth.Adam had two sons, Canin andAbel. Cain was more given to evil than Abel. Adamwas called to offer sacrifice so also were his sons. Thesacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Cain's and Caintook it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so hekilled Abel. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]The Lord said I will not kill Cainbut I will put a mark upon him and it is seen in theface of every Negroee on the earth and it is the decree ofGod that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cainand the Curse until all the seed of Abel should be redeemedand Cain will not recive the Priesthood or salvation untilall the seed of Abel are redeemed.Any man having one drop of the seedof Cain in him cannot hold the Priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the nameof Jesus Christ. I know it is true and others knowit.The Negroe cannot hold one particle of governmentbut the day will come when all the seed of Cain will beredeemed and have all the blessings we have now and a greatdeal more but the seed of Abel will be aheiad of theseed of Cain to all eternity.Let me consent to day to mingle myseed with the seed of Cain and it will bring the samecurse upon me and it would upon any man; and ifany man mingle his seed with the seed of Cain theonly way he could get rid of it or have salvation wouldbe to come forward and have his head cut off and spillhis blood upon the ground and it would also take thelife of his children. 
 It is said that if a man takes ^kills^ another he takesthat which he cannot give. If a man's head is cut off his life isnot destroyed nor his Spirit. That lives. His tabernacle isdestroyed. But I can make as good tabernacles as I candestroy. If you will not believe it look at my children.Much blood was shed in ancient timesboth of man and beast. The firstlings and best of the flock was sacrificed on the Altar; and in some instancesmany men and almost whole nations were sacrificed or putto death because of their sins and wickedness. This was theonly way they could be saved at all.If Jesus Christ had not had his bloodshed the blood that he received from his mother Marythe world would not have been saved.There is not one of the seed of oldCain that is permitted to rule the reign over the seed ofAbel and neither you nor I can help it.Those that do bear rule should do it inrighteousness. I am opposed to the present system ofslavery. The Negro should serve the seed of Abraham but it should be done right. Dont abusethe Negro and treat him cruel.It has been argued here that manyof the Jews were black. Whenever the seed of Judahmingled with the seed Cain they lost the Priesthood andall their blessings.As an example; let the Presidency TwelveSeventies High Priests Bishops and all the authorities sayNow we will all go and mingle with the seed of Cainand they may have all the privelegies they want; andwe lift our hands to heaven in support of this.That moment we lose the Priesthood and all its blessingsand we should not be redeemed until Cain was. I 
 will never admit of it for a moment. Some may think I dontknow as much as they do; but I know that I do ^know^ more than they.The Lord will watch us all the timeThe Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am determinedhe shall not rule at all; and Negros shall not rule us, Iwill not consent for the seed of Cain to vote for me or mybrethren. If you want to know why we did notspeak of this in the Constitution it was because it was noneof their business.Any man is a citizen black white or redand if the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite bloodin them they are citizens and shall have their rights butnot to rule for me or my brethren.Those persons from the Islands andforeign countries know nothing about governing the peopleThe Canaanite cannot have wisdom to do things as thewhite man has.We must quarrel against all evil. I amnot going to let this people damn themselves as long asI can help it."An AddressDelivered byPresident Brigham Young.Feb 8th 1852.I trust in the Lord for light as I have heretofore doneWhen the minds of men are open to understand they will see thingsas they are. We are subject to all the evils which there arein the world.I have thought this world as fallen as any of 
 the creation of God. When the Lord created the earth or any worldif they leave an exaltation they will have to experience all that weexperience. I see no reason why they should not be temptedas we are tempted. If we are candidates for exaltation andglory and we cannot get that exaltation and glory in any other waythen we should be reconciled to it and be satisfied to let theLord do with us as he pleasesIs there any evil upon any person oraffliction upon any nation or Kingdom that God does not permit?There is not. We should then be faithful to God in all thingsto be his secret counsellor. if If necessary Why should we complainor find fault with God about anything? We should not. Seethe example of the nations of the earth. They complainabout everything and against all this Providences. There isno proceeding of ours of act or experience but what he knowsall about.If it would be any satisfaction to youI would say that God has passed through all the trials andexperience that we have. Jesus Christ has passed throughall the trials and experience the same as we. It would notbe prudent to say that the Father has not the sameexperience that his Son has. He had quite as muchas his Son.Let the Saints look about themselves andsee if they have as great things as they expected. Whenthey first received the Gospel and the Holy Ghost openedtheir minds they saw that Zion was to be built up andIsrael gathered, the power of God and the Holy Ghostto be poured out upon us. "If we could get a place byourselves how faithful we would live and thank God." Doyou have the same things that you looked for? WellI dont know you say. This shows that somebodyhas let down their watch and influenced others and they 
 have not lived up to their privilegesWhen we first received the Gospel we werehumble but since then the Tempter has come and we are temptedwith many things. But this is right. The Lord permitsit. We could not get glory without it.Let me ask if any one is here whowent to Jackson County in 1831? The feeling was if I couldget with the Saints all my sorrow and trouble will be at an endSo it is with the Saints in England. Before we preached the gathering to them the Lord revealed it to them that they would begathered. We told them not to reveal it till the time came.Do you have anything now that you lookedfor in the beginning. If not something is the matter. Youdon't do right. You dont settle this difficulty or that. Butwhat is the matter? You are wrong yourself. Whathinders you from praying all day or having fasting and prayer? You have enough to eat; but the greatdifficulty is when they moved to Zion they brought themselveswith them.You had so many devil in you thatthey trouble you. When the devil and wicked menhave afflicted and persecuted us as far as was for ourgood then the Lord says stop and go no farther. Butif we take everything patiently all our afflictions will worktogether for our good. But do you at the presenttime have anything to mar your peace except what youbring upon yourselves. You have privileges here butdo the people prize their privileges?Why do the people go to the Kanyonsafter wood on Sunday? Why have they gone to day?Why dont I do it? Why do I not visit my farmor the bath house on Sunday? Because it is not rightand sets a bad example. I cannot do these things 
 on the Sabbath.Some will take poles from his neighbours fence ortake a chain or an axe without liberty. This is wrong. Thereis nothing on earth to mar our peace but our own acts. Butthe great difficulty is we cannot get away from ourselves. Somethink perhaps that if they go to the Gold digings they can getaway from themselves but they cannot.When persecution and trials come they scorchthe good seed and it dries up.How are you going to get Zion. Nothinghinders our having Zions but ourselves. We have all thepriveleges of angels to worship God and get all blessings weneed.We have to war with all devils temptations andtrials until we overcome. I will fight until I overcomeIf I fall into the grave there are others who will take myplace. There are many who will fight and if needsto will take the Sword.I hope all who want good principles willhave the privilege of receiving them. To day is a day oftithing and sacrafice; to morrow comething the burning.I would say that you cannot beperfect without me nor I without you. The Providencesof God have so interwoven and identified the interest of thechildren of Adam together that they cannot be perfectwithout each other.Do you enjoy yourselves and have peace. Ihave peace and no man can take it from me. If you donot have peace and no man can take it from me. If you donot have peace it is because you drive stakes and the Lordwill not let you do it.But let the will of God be done. Ifyou dont enjoy Zion it is because you dont say "Let thewill of God be done. There is nothing to take your Zion 
 away but yourselves.We are to be tried and tempted in every way in orderto prove ourselves the friend of God in all things and God will bless youMy prayer is that God may bless this people and that they may befaithful and the friends of God.I told the Legislature that I shouldbe proud to have the world know that I told the Assembly tofast and pray until they got the Spirit of God to do their dutyI would like to see the judges upon the Bench to ask God tobless them and all the Jury and witnesses to assist them in alltheir testimony and decisions."On the 1st of March I was 45 yearsof age.On the 4th the Governor President of the CouncilSpeaker of the House with all the members of both branchesof the Legislature assembled with their ladies at the CouncilHouse and partook of an excellent feast. The Governorgave an interesting address in the evening which closedwith the shout of hosannah.Two days later and the LegislativeAssembly adjourned until the next December and theGovernor blessed the Assembly.On the 1st of April I attended a partyat the Bath House. About 51 gentlemen and 100 ladieswere present. I addressed the Assembly at 8 o'clock in the eveningand returned home. The Presidency and Twelve and thosewho had been at work in the Council House assisting in theendowments were washed and anoited. I did not getword of it and was not present.This evening the mail arrived which had been anxiously looked for during many weeks. From itwe gathered American and European news and found that there 
 were warm times in Congress in consequence of the Utah Judgeshaving gone home and made reports against Governor Young and others.General Conference.ofThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsheldIn the Tabernacle Great Salt Lake CityApril 6 1852There were present Brigham Young H. C. Kimball andWillard Richards of the First Presidency; and Orson PrattWilford Woodruff and George A Smith of the quorum of theTwelve. Also Patriarchs John Smith and Isaac Morley,Daniel Spencer President of the Stake the Presidents of the several guorums and a congregation that filled the Tabernacleto overflowing. Hundreds could not get into the house.The President took the Stand at 10 o'clockand said"We adjourned last conference to meet in theTabernacle to day. We are here in the New Tabernacleaccording to appointment."The hymn was then sung — "Lord inthe morning thou shalt hear"The dedication prayer was offered upby Willard Richards and is published in the Deseret NewsPresident Young arose and saidI arise to say a few words, as we have offered the "Dedication Prayer", upon that subjectWho could foresee the way of the Lord 
 April: 1852.as we now see it? We can now behold the manifestationof the Lord. He has done what we could not but wehave an experience that teaches us to trust in the Lord.We should not undertake to dictate theLord for his work will go on. We have seen plentytry to dictate the Lord and tray to build up themselvesand not this kingdom; but they soon fall and the Lordoverthrows them; but this work goes on the Gospel ispreached and all his work rolls forth.Let the wicked do what they please:we have the privelege of worshiping God and being happyI wish to dedicate all I possess unto God and praise himand do all he requires of me.At the last Conference I was sickand not able to be with you — not able to be up. Imeditated upon the State of the Church. I saw somegoing to the right and some to the left: some after gold andthe riches of this life. I said I would tell the brethrenmy feelings. I said I would go to work and build atabernacle and worship the Lord so that we would notbe driven home by a storm. I saw also that somewould say I cannot go for I must take care of mycattle my farm my fields &c; but I said I would go andworship God as long as I wished if the whole earth sunk.Some delight in a fine horse farmor house or good things of this life; but this is nothing toyou. It is good in its place. But you cannotpray because you cannot spend time.Some women cannot spend time tohave prayers. You know it is your duty to pray anddedicate yourselves to God and your family and all youpossess.Some feel as though they must go to 
 April 1852.night to the Kanyons; but if you will hearken to counsel you will say to all the world stand by: I am going to worship the Lord. Letthe dead bury the dead; but I will dedicate myself and aff familyand all I have unto the Lord. No matter what the Lordsets you about go at it and do it.There is a great change with this peopleWe have been sick; now are we well: We have been poor, noware we rich, have been distressed and mobed now we have peace.How long will it last? As long as this people do right.It havs been 22 years since this Churchwas organized. We should serve the Lord, love the Lordwith all our hearts cease to do wrong or find fault with anyof the Saints. If they do wrong chastise them and nothate them.Are the people prepared to make a covenantto dedicate themselves and their hearts to God from this hour?I feel to urge all the brethren and sisters to dedicate themselvesunto the Lord.If we can gain the victory and say I willdo the work of the Lord in all things; if he will makehis will known I will perform it. Not only say butperform it and dedicate our affections unto the Lord.We may find some that cannot do thisThey say I want some gold or something to help myselfwith to get out of difficulties. What will be done insuch a case? I will tell you what I would do.If I had got but one cow and she plagued me I wouldgive her away. If you have anything that is in your way give it to the public works.Let nothing get between you and Godand I will tell you what to do. If anything getsbetween you and God give it to his service or youcannot get through the gates of the celestial city. 
 Why are you not as poor ^pure^ an the Church of Enoch?Because you have not the mind to be. I will make myhands do the will of God and my heart will go with it. Thespirit of envy will not obey. Then unite your interestwith this kingdom for this kingdom will stand forever.Put your interest with it so that you cannot get away andthen you will stick to the kingdom; but if your purseof gold is in your pocket and you apostatize you maygo away but if your interest is with the church and youdo wrong you may stay until you get the Spirit ofGod again and may be saved.We must build up this kingdom firstand dont be afraid of storming for this kingdom will bean everlasting kingdom that will not be thrown downIt will stand forever. The more the wicked try tothrow it down the more it will stand. If youwant it to stand unite your interest with it in sucha manner that you cannot get it away. Then you aresafe.If I was to ask what was your opinionconcerning the Millinnium I should get a great manyopinions; but the truth is all will be in one sense as it isnow. You will eat built and do all things as nowonly you will be more pure and united and all will servethe Lord and not the devil any more. Let this peoplepossess this spirit and here would be the Millinnuimas it would be with any people who will do this."President Young closed with blessing thepeople and after singing and prayer the meeting [a]djourned.In the afternoon the Tabernacle wascrowded to excess. Orson Pratt and Orson Spencerdelivered discourses.Next morning the Tabernacle was 
 at an early hour filled to overflowing and in the morning of this day'sConference the authorities of the church were presented. Amongthe rest H. C. Kimball moved that Brigham Young be the Governorof the State of Deseret which was carried unaminously; andthat Heber C. Kimball be the Lieut. Governor which wassustained with applause.President Young remarked that "no doubtbefore you get home you will hear we have committed treason."With regard to the labour of this TabernacleI will say the cost will be read before the meeting and all thetithing and outlay; but you feel that your expectationsare realized you should be satisfied.I will say I never saw any room asconvenient as this. It will seat 2,200 persons and theseis are 2,500 persons here to day. I expect the Tabernaclethat we intend to build on this block will seat 15000people. We never did build a house large enough tohold the people. If we were to enclose this whole 10acre block so that it would hold two hundred thousandpeople by the time we go[t] it done there would be enoughto fill it."The Lord is controling our affairs and doesmore for us than we can do for ourselves or ask him to do forus. The more we are humble and will labour andprepare for the gathering of Israel the faster they will gather."The establishment of this Tabernacle wasthe result of my meditation while on a sick bed."I feel as usual to praise the Lord with all my heart. The hand of God has been as visible in leadingthis people as it was in leading Israel in the days of MosesSome had not faith to come on for fear of starving to death. 
 April 1852Brother Kempton spoke for a few moments and thenagain President Young spoke and observed"The Gentiles will take exception to what issaid here. I know as the Lord lives that the people ofthe United States have departed from the Spirit and letter of theirConstitution and this people will be the only people who willsustain it."Wm W. Phelps in an address remarkedthat this was the third time he had been to a "dedicationof a house built to worship God in. He was at Kirtlandwhen the angel of the Lord came in and sat there duringservice."In the afternoon the manifesto of therecepts and expenditures of the tithing from Oct 1848 toMarch 27th 1852 was laid before the Conference. Thesum total of the numerous items stood as follows:Total of all $353,765.69Yet to be accounted for 36,495 12Property on hand 75,550 04President Young remarked"For my own satisfaction and greatconsolation there has not one dollar gone into the hands of alawyer as in the days of Joseph At that time almostevery dollar had to go into the hands of lawyers and theypro^se^cuted him all the day long. But I said Iwould kill any man who sought to take me.Many thought my purse reachedfrom eternity to eternity — that there was no end to itWe were called "bogus makers." Brother Kimballsaid we would go where we could coin the pure gold$10 at a lick. We have done so even $20 at atime. 
 April 1852Our brethren went to Calafornia. The hand of Godwas in all this. They opened the gold mines and the Lordhad a design in it to see who would be tried by it. Neverdid nor ever will any of the Saints go to dig gold there withoutbeing sent without being damned by it. Mark my words.If we go on to the devils ground we shall be left to smellhell: we shall feel the wrath of God. If I was sent thereby the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called meto go. Many Elders in Israel some good menhave tried it and smutted themselves up so that it isquite a question if they will ever be washed clean.I have said I did not think that therewas one dollar in 20 paid in tithing that had been spenton the Public Works but it seems from the Books that therehas been about one fourth. The other 3 fourths I have had to borrow. If I had to borrow all the moniesthat is used and none assist me to pay it, it will make myhead ache.I have trusted the Lord and servedhim all the day long and when I undertake anything I persevere until I accomplish it. I see the differencein trusting in God and doing business according to theorder of the world.There is not one hair droped frommy head unnoticed and does God not know what I want.There never was a miracle only to the ignorantIt is all to be accounted for on natural principles. TheLord will not turn wa stone and clay into gold to suit meThere is enough without it. Jesus did not makebread out of a stone; but he had knowledge and powerand did call together the elements to make bread andthe elements into the water to make wine. ^out^ Butthe Lord is not going to work a miracle to clothe us 
 Raise your wool and flax and spin and weave it and make it upand not have to pay cash for every pound you use. What youbuy is hardly worth making up but what you make is strongand will wear."In the evening the Priesthood filled theTabernacle at an early hour and was addressed by PresidentBrigham Young. He arose and said:"This is certainly a mixed congregationof all the officers of the Church. We are to be instructedin all things. The knowledge that is now in the midst ofthis people is more than in all the world besides. Allscience is in the midst of this people even if they have not learnedit as the world has.I have my cogitations and views of theaffairs of this Kingdom; but I have learned that we mustwork to the scribe if not we may fail in it; but if wework in faith and confidence the Lord is apt to help us.I asked a favour of the Bishops todivide the money debts in each ward that it might be paid.Let us contend with ourselves and diciplineourselves until everything within us is brought into subjectionto the law of Christ. You have been taught the firstprinciples of the Gospel now teach yourselves and the Church.Our school is the School of the ProphetsThis is a school to paline and polish ourselves. Andsuppose under such privilege we should indulge in eviland neglect our families and our duty to God? Allour former sins would be upon our Heads.It is for a man to commit himselfand all that he presides over unto God to do his will and to continue to do it until he is santified.If your neighbour does you evil, donot do evil to him. Bear with him and set him 
 right but dont quarrel with him; but be careful that you conduct yourselfwell until you are prepared for the society of holy men.This is as I said the school of the ProphetsOur baptism is only the beginning of our work. You mustthen go on the perfection. You must perform this work. Ourchildren understand the Gospel but do they understand the wayto govern their lives? We shall never see a day but what we can learn. We shall not inherit the glory of God allat once or understand all knowledge; but God teaches ussmall principles to prepare us for greater ones.Let us learn in this school. There area great many books of education of the present day. The mainbranch of our study is theology. I understand it better thanany in the world. Adam Enoch Moses Aaron Jesusand the Apostles have all been in the same school in their dayand have faithfully learned that they might be perfected. Theyare my brethren and will be my company; and I now tellyou if you want me to have full fellowship with you ceasespeaking evil of God and all good men whether in heavenor earth.When a man is in the right track he willcome and lay down anything at the feet of a brother to settlea difficulty and rather wrong themselves himself than have a difficulty out.If you wanted revelation written diging goldgoing to England or any other place. I profess to be anApostle. Every Apostle will have to be a revelator andhave revelations if there are thousands of them if they do theirduty and live up to their calling if not they will have to beremoved. But a man who is not an Apostle hasnot power to stand at the head of the Kingdom of God,hold the Keys of the Priesthood and build up and leadthe Church of God. The highest authority on the earth 
 is our Apostle.Jesus Christ will have a class of men who will do allthat he requires of them. They will have the greater glory; butthose who cannot endure will have a lesser glory."George A. Smith delivered a discourse after thepresident had closed.Next day the Tabernacle was filled at 9 o'clockand the meeting opened by prayer from Elder Wilford Woodruff whothen addressed the assembly. He was followed by Orson Spencer Judge Z. Snow and W. W. Phelps and then PresidentYoung made the following remarks."The subject I am at is to enlightenthe mind. It is expected we have to learn lettersWith regard to the principle of education it commenceswith the mother. I do not like to see mothersattend to everything else but their children. They shouldteach their children all they can for early impassionswill last persons during their lives whether they be good or bad. I will tell  you the truth as it isin eternity. If the child does not have goodinstruction in early life it will be requird at the handof the mother and not at the hand of the father.The child will think the mother isthe best woman on earth and the mother has power to instill into the mind of the child what she please and whatshe imparts unto ^it^ them will stay with them ^it^ through life.Mothers should take care of their childrenand not spend their time watching their husbands. It isthe duty of mothers to stay at home and take care oftheir children. My duty calls me to be in the standI know not what my children are about or what theyare doing. They may be in the street swearing forwhat I know as others do. If they should go to hell 
 it would be required at the hands of the mother and not at my handsA child of mine shall not conquer me. I would sooner see themdie than that they should conquer me. If any one of mychildren will not follow my footsteps I will disinherit or disownthem. They shall not have part in my kingdom. I would rather get children adopted to me who would keep thecommandments.No child should rise up and teach and controlthe mother; nor should woman rise up and dictate thehusband and the husband should not rise up and try to dictatehis president or the Lord.Education begins with the mother to thechild. You must keep it in remembrance that the Lordhas commanded you to multiply and replenish the earththat you may have joy and rejoicing in the day of the holyresurrection.Do you keep your minds pure and doyou pray night and day. Now pray from the time ofconception till the time of delivery that your child may befilled with the Holy Ghost and that a noble spirit from eternitymay come into the Tabernacle and that the Holy Ghost mayrest upon the father mother and child.When some speak you cannot understandthey make use of such high flown words; but when I speakyou can understand the verity in the English language.I would like to be with the Holy Ones who are full of eternal light. A point of the finger or emotion would communicate without words. When I am full ofthe Holy Ghost I can see a man as well behind asbefore. I can see their hearts by the Spirit ofGod and know what is in them."In the afternoon one hundred werecalled for to go with their teams to meet the emigrants 
 and some were appointed to go on foreign missions:Thomas Margetts to Italy, T. B. BroderickJohn Dalley and John Armstrong to England; George Parman tothe nations Wm Fatheringham to Calcutta Edward Stephenson toGiberalter James Dilley and two others to Scotland and AlfredSmith for foreign mission.The Seventies held a meeting at nighton the subject of building the Seventies Hall, and they wereaddressed by Joseph Young George A Smith WilfordWoodruff and others.Synopsis of An AddressbyPresident YoungApril the 9th."This people are blessed with all that heart can with andyet many are not satisfied. This is the case with somespirits and they want things illegally.It is not necessary that we should havea Temple. It is absolutely necessary that we should havea Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacleis to assemble the multitude for meeting but a Temple is togather the Priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord.Are we prepared to go and redeem ourdead? Is there a place prepared that we may go andredeem our dead? No there is not. We give endowmentshere but it is like trying to step on to the top round firstIf we had the privelege of buildinga temple our works would not be legal but we do these thingsuntil we have time to build a temple. If we had gone onto the top of the mountains if we had no room it would be legal and right. 
 Brother Kimball says we have to make our ownheaven. The Lord cannot save us if we do not save ourselves. Ifwe expect to get our endowments we have got to follow the footstepsthat God has set for us to walk in and if we walk in that channelGod owns our labours and acknowledges all that is done.Now all the ordinances will have to be attended toagain when we get a Temple. Yet if any one dies in faith thoseordinances will be legal; but all that live will have to do it againand I will say as a revelation that if you will not help build a Temple and have faith in the work you will be lost.A word to those who have got their endowmentsWe shall work as fast as we can and what we have done islegal. If we had been in our own lands and had a right toa temple we should not do as we now do.Many have died in the faith, have beenworn out: their ordinances are legal. Those who came intothe church first and are faithful have a right to the ordinancesfirst.I wish the people to understand that when theLord has anything for them they will have it; but when theLord has nothing for the people I don't want for them to teazeme for what they cannot have. When there is to be a workdone I will tell you.Now we shall begin to build a temple in 1853. This Tabernacle will have to accomodate the people until the Temple is built. If this wont answer forthe people until we build a Temple we will make a Boweryon the North and South sides of the block.At soon as the Temple is built we willgive you your endowments. If there are any who were inJackson County and other places and have helped to build upthe Kindom of God in the early days we want to bless themfirst; and if there is any man or child who went in the Battalion 
 or Pioneers come forward and get your blessings before others andwe will bless you. If you are faithful there is no blessingin the celestial law or kingdom of God but what you willget.I want to be sealed to my father before Ishall be a legal heir. If I were to die and there wasnot a child of mine to live to do it for me some friendwould be raised up to do it and if not my body willsoon be raise up and I should be in some Temple withmy brothren to tell them what to do.I can see the hearts of men and the spirits of men. If they do try to be hid I cansee them. I see many who aspire to be first andto be exalted above their fellows; but I can tellyou all you will be rewarded according to what you dowhether you do little or much or nothing at all.Some wish to be above BrotherBrigham. Why was I not called before brother JosephWhy does not some one ask the Lord to appoint them tobe above brother Brigham? But the Lord will laughat you. Such forget the Kingdom of God. They are corrupt.Let every man say what can I doto build up the Kingdom of God. Ask the mother whois trying to do the will of God what her reward will be?She will say I dont know but I will say if you arefaithful and satisfied with your condition in this life youwill be blessed and satisfied with your condition in the world to come.Let all strive to be satisfied with theirconditions in life and that will be a blessing to them."Other matters concerning paying ourdebts &c were touched upon by the President and then ElderJohn Banks followed in some interesting remarks. 
 After several others had spoken the meeting adjournedIn the afternoon of this day's conference President Young delivered hisgreat discourse on Adam our Father and God. I recorded a synopsisof it in my journal but a full report of it is published in the Journalof Discourses Vol I.The Conference continued until the close ofSunday the 11th.On the last day after an address from HeberC. Kimball who remarked that Bishop Hunter was Chief Bishopand had the right to choose his two councillors the PresidingBishop arose and said he should choose men who could assist.Brigham Young was at the head and his councillors were inspiredof the Holy Ghost." I select for my councillors Brigham Youngand Heber C. Kimball."Then Brother Heber C. FKimball and Willard Richards laid hands upon Bishop Hunter's head andblessed him and said ^H C Kimball said^"O God the Eternal Father I ask in the nameof Jesus Christ while we lay our hands upon they head ^the head of thy servant^ that allour words may be dictated by the Holy Ghost while we setapart brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop. We hereby setyou apart to be a presiding Bishop and to be a judge in Israel. We bless you with the Spirit of your office and calling. You shall have wisdom to judge between goodand evil in all things and to be a great benefit to the houseof Israel and that they may uphold thee by their faith thatthou mayest administer in faith and righteousness and be a great blessing to the people and administer to the poor and needyThou shalt have discernment like the lightning to detect the evil and those who seek to deceive and that all may receive thyteachings and thy work may work together for the good of allthe people: even so Amen."^Of^ To Brother Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball 
 said:"You should be blessed and all your house and not one of themshall be last and no man shall get between me and Brother Brighamand Brother Richards and no man or woman shall get between theTwelve and Presidency: if they do they will get pinched andany man or woman who tried to get between us will be damnedThey tried to prejudice Joseph against us in his day and they will bedamned."The Twelve are the best men that live and anyman who tries to put their feet upon their neck will get thefeet of the Twelve upon their own neck."President Young came in at this moment and brotherHeber continued"Do as brother Brigham tells you and all willbe right and you will not have sorrow. Follow my counseland you will not have sorrow. If my family would takemy counsel and had faith in me I would never have adoctor in my family for ^but^ I have doctors here that I have faithin but lLet me send for a doctor and they have faith in himand not in me and then what further am I."Brother Brigham observed, "That is trueand worthy of note.""If you are not one you are not mine saiththe Lord; but if you abide in me you will bring forth fruitto the glory of God. When we learn this lesson our sorrowswill cease. When we get the clock off we shall be in heavenIn this house is my heaven for I am in a heavenly placewith holy men and angels." x x x x x x x xThe old lion's neck is out of the yoke andthey will not put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whipthem out and they shall not whip him out nor me nor my breathren. You shall be blessed and the earth shall bringforth for your good and you shall be blessed in your posterity

He had known the quorum of theTwelve from the beginning since they were first together in his father's housesince his absence to Denmark on mission he had learnt how to appreciatethe society of home and his brethren, &c.Orson Hyde said we were at liberty to prophesy whiletogether as moved upon by the Holy Ghost and if we did not feel toprophesy to speak by faith and it should be fulfilled. He had unlimitedconfidence in every member of the Twelve and the Presidency andprophesied in the name of God that we should all meet andcome forth in the first resurrection and receive our crowns inthe celestial Kingdom" which was confirmed by a good Amenby all the quorum.John Taylor next spoke and referred to the changesamong the nations and said that the ^day^ was near when Kings would seek counsel at our hands. "In the beginning the Elderswent out ignorant men now they are full of intelligenceand the nations of the earth will feel their influence."George A. Smith was delighted with theoccasion and rejoiced to see the union of the quorum and theirdispositions to do right. " We dont have to feel that LymanWight is drawing off one way John E. Page another and WmSmith committing iniqiuty and we forced to sustain themagainst our feelings. I have the satisfaction of believingthat each member of the quorum was is doing right and Irejoice that the quorum have been able to publish the Gospelin six different languages and to gather the people together. Hehoped we should meet once a week and with the Presidentsoffer our Prayers; felt a proud satisfaction in being associatedwith 10 men whom he believed ^possessed^ the most intelligence of anymen upon the earth and believed the prophesies of that eveningwould be fulfilled. He closed with his blessing upon us. 
 Among other remarks Amasa Lyman said He hadfound out what that love and affection for his brethren is that surpassesthe love of woman for he had a confidence in his quroum far greaterthan in his wives and children, for his brethren had been brought upin the hard school of experience and had been tried in all things andproven true and I have been proven with them. I am wedded tomy quorum with all my interest. I go when I am sent and comewhen I am called and so expect to continue to do. My interestis inseperatelybelly connectd with this Kingdom and I trust ever willbe through time and eternity.C. C. Rich expressed his feelings and said, "onmy way home I had a dream. I thought the ancients in theirresurrected bodies were associated with us in this place. I havethe most unbounded faith in the quorum of the Twelve and inthe First Presidency. I hope the Winter Season may beprofitable to us in our associations and that we may improve ourour time."E. T. Benson next spoke and among a memberof remarks said"If the First Presidency were to be removed thequorum of the Twelve would have to preside and if they hadnot the fulness of the gifts they would not be fit to presideI feel exceedingly thankful to be associated with such men. Ihave not language to express my feelings when I was firstcalled to be an Apostle in this quorum. I could not sleepfor three days and nights. I feel now as though I couldbreak a nation to pieces. I felt renovated with theHoly Spirit while Parley P. Pratt was speaking. No blessingis too great or too good for us and we shall possess themall."Lorenzo Snow said his sentimentswere shadowed forth in his labours. I have great joyin meeting with you am beholding your faces and contemplating 
 the influence and power of this quorum and the greatness of their workI anticipate much this Winter in our meetings and in enjoying theblessing of God. I have rejoiced this night to hear the exalted expressionsof the quorum in rendering thangsgiving to God and not one wordof complaint of hardships inprisonments or afflictions of any kindbut we are filled with hidden joy and peace. I feel determinedto do all that is asigned me that I may be worthy a place inthis quorum. I felt grateful to hear the blessings pronouncedupon us by our President."He closed with joy and thanksgiving.Wilford Woodruff next addressed the quorum uponthe importance of their keeping private histories of theirlives labours and ministry and also a joint history of thequorum of the Twelve Apostles. He said since he had beena member of the Church he had been inspired not only to writeall his own acts and life but to write the sermons teachingsand prophesies of the Prophet Joseph , President [Brigham Young|Young] and counciland of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted withtheir labours. He said each member of the quorum should keep an account of his own mission works miracles and the blessings of God unto him and that the history of the TwelveApostles could now be easily obtained; but if we omittedit until we are dead our friends could not get it correctlybefore the world.Parley P. Pratt spoke of the filling up of the quorum of the Twelve in 1848 and of their commencing a record of the Twelve Apostles and wished it continued. Hedid not know how far and minute we ought to be butthought we ought to record our official acts and considered itfor our interest as well as a duty thus to do.E. T. Benson said President Willard Richards wishedhim to request the younger members of the quorum to handto him a short statement of their lives and ministry to go 
 into the Church History.George A. Smith Wilford Woodruff and Parley PPratt interchanged a few words upon the subject of Journal keeping.Franklin D. Richards next spoke and said I feelbehind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so muchteaching and counsel from brother Joseph as they have. When Icontemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour is equal to the noblest ambition which man could entertain both in thisworld and the next. He felt his joy tempered in the recolection.Orson Hyde said:"While I have been listening I havehad an unusual train of reflection. Of necessity we shallsoon be called again to seperate and the Kingdoms of this worldmust become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. Weare trained in the school of experience. I may live to see you all in different parts of the earth and while the Kingdoms ofthe earth are falling you will in many instances be enableto streahch out your hands and give counsel and save manypeople and be enabled to rule governments and thus fulfill theprophecies. Many of these things are not afar off. Allis eternity to us whether this or the other side of the veilWe are born in eternity and let us be where we will it willbe our calling to win souls unto Christ. The Presidencyare unwell or they would be here. I wish the Journalsof the Twelve to be written up so that they can be on handwhen needed to be published. I wish each one of the quorum to write as good an epistle as he can and havethe whole put in a book form and sent forth into the world."Parley P. Pratt thought the subject aboundedin us. "We owe the world a testimony not as individualsbut as a quorum of the Twelve Apostles."He suggested that each should contributean epistle and from the whole compile and embody a book 
 to go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined "Historyof the Twelve ApostlesGeorge A. Smith thought it very important thatan authentic history of each member should be preserved.Wilford Woodruff mentioned certain items which heconsidered necessary in the preservation of our history. He lamentedthat David W. Patten had not left any record of his life for he was aProphet and an Apostle and a mighty man. Many miracles werewrought by him. He told a rich man in Tennessee who foughtthe work of God that he and his family should beg their bread. RobertC. Petty saw that same man cry at a blaksmith's shop becausehe could not get trusted to have his plough sharpened."President Orson Hyde moved that Wilford Woodruffbe the clerk and historian of the Twelve Apostles. Carriedunanimously.P. P. Pratt proposed a new reord and wished thatthe Narative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recordedin it beginning with the President and going through with eachmember in order as he stands in the quorum.W. Woodruff said he was willing to serve thequorum as its historian as faithfully as he could through it wouldbe a heavy tax on his time.Erastus Snow enquired if the Historycontemplated is to be confined to the present quorum or the membersfrom the beginning.Parley P. Pratt throught it should merely includethe present quorum.Erastus Snow would like to see included allthat could be found of David W. Patten.Charles C. Rich observed that the morning ofthe day when David Patten was martyred he said the Kingdomof God should be delivered or he should lay down his lifeParley P. Pratt wished brother Woodruff 
 to leave all temporal business as much as possible and bring thisHistory up.A. Lyman said there was no date of his ordination.Orson Hyde proposed for the Twelve to meet withthe Presidency and also to meet each week for a mutual exchangeof thought.We then adjourned to meet at the same place one week from that date.On the 29 of Dec the quorum of the Twelvemet and spent the evening upon conversation upon some plan forliberating ourselves and families so that we could be foot-looseto go and preach the Gospel.On the last day of Dec 1852 I looked overmy Journal and made up the followingSynopsisofThe Journal of Wilford Woodrufffor 1852Travels: I travelled with President Brigham Young HeberC.

 1853I wrote in my Journal at the timeMy Reflections on the New Year.A new year in the midst of a new era! Oh howtime flies and how great how important how magnificent are the events broorne on its wings. It is the opening of a dispensationthat swallows up all other dispensations since the world beganThe deeds of the last thousand years sink into insignificence incomparison to the work of the present time.The heavens gaze upon the scenes asthey pass with deep interest while the whole earth behold thescenes in wonder and amazement. The ancient Prophets sawby vision and revelation the scenes which were to follow eachother in quick succession in this age in the establishment of thegreat Kingdom of God to be thrown down no more forever. Thelittle stone cut out of the mountain without hands which was toroll forth until it became a mountain and filled the whole earth 
 1853breaking in pieces and subduing all other kingdoms and itself to stand foreveras seen by the Prophet David has commenced its work.That Church and Kingdom of God is now on the earth and is being established and must endure. The world are gazingupon it, located in these valleys of the mountains like a City set upon a hill which cannot be hid.  Its first Prophet and founder has laiddown his life in its defence. He has been martyred and his bloodis crying from the ground for vengeance upon a great nation. Manyothers have fallen martyrs to the truth and the Gospel of Jesus Christsince the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ in A. D. 1830and many more may; yet the Church is bound to rise and prosperuntil the Zion and Kingdom of our God shall stand forth in boldrelief with all that power might majesty and dominion which Godhas declared concerning her and which has been spoken through themouths of his holy Prophets since the world began.This Church and Kingdom has continuedsteadily to arise since its first organization amid opposition oppressionpersecution and martyrdom until it has become established in the midstof the "everlasting hills" not only gaining strength in Church but also in State.Ephraims nobles are of himself and his Governorhas proceeded out of the midst of him. And while truth inspiresmy heart shall I feelt to write it? Shall I feer that the present or future generations may read these truths which areburning in my breast unkindled by the altars of heaven? NoGod forbid! for the voice of truth whispers to me that our GovernorsPresidents and Senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God willbe inspired to take bold measures perform daring acts and in theirstrength and power stretch forth their strong arm and save them fromannihilation that holy instrument—the Constitution of the UnitedStates which the ^American^ people are about to sell for a mess of pottageand try to consign it to the grave; but there is a power who has decreed that liberty freedom and the rights of the meek of the 
 Earth shall not wholly die; and that power is God. He has decreed toinspire and nerve up the soul the sinew and the arm of his governorssenators and Prophets and own them for the contest and defend themin their warefare. That nation or Kingdom or tongue or peoplefrom this time forth who shall rise up against Zion—the Church andKingdom of God—to oppress her shall be visited by the judgementsof the Most High and be overthrown and brought to desolationand may God spedily hasten it. May the Almighty beginthis year to rend the Kingdoms of this world with his servantsand continue it until all nations shall acknowledge there isa God in Israel."On the 1st day of the new year the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles met at the Council House at 8 o'clock being elevenin number: Orson Pratt was absent in Washington.The quorum marched to President Brigham Young's and wished him a happy new year. President Youngreceived them with joy and gladness and after the greetingswere over he asked us what he should treat us towith. Thesentiment was instantaneous in the hearts of all the quorumand spoken by President Orson Hyde: "Treat us with yourblessing."Then President Young blessed the quorum of theTwelve Apostles and said they always had his blessing; andthe Twelve felt and realized that the blessings of the Presidencyof the Church and Kingdom of God was of far more worth andbenefit to them than any earthly gift or the treasures of theearth and their hearts were full of joy and gladness.The Twelve left their blessings upon PresidentYoung and his house. While they were paying their respectsto him the band was playing a lively tune in the front ofthe house. The quorum saluted the two bands with ahappy new year and received in return some excellent music. 
 The quorum of the Twelve next visited President Heber C.Kimball and wished him a happy New Year and he also received themwith gladness and gave unto them his blessing which was also highly prizedIn his blessing unto them he said his faith and feelings were that noone of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall and no power shouldtake their crown and Kingdom; but they should come forth in the morningof the first resurrection and be exalted to glory immortality and eternallives. Their blessings should increase from that time hencforthand forever and they should not want bread but they should have meansto support themselves and families."The Twelve left their blessings upon PresidentKimball and then visited Father John Smith the aged Patriarch of theChurch and wished him a happy new year. He manifested muchjoy and satisfaction in seeing eleven of the Twelve Apostles beneathhis roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon the Twelvehis blessing and said they should live to see the Kingdom of Godand Zion established to be thrown down no more forever and thatnone of them should ever fall but they should have part in thefirst resurrection. No power should take their crowns butthey should be blessed in all their labours in the earth and theblessings of God should increase upon them from that timeforth both temporal and spiritual.The Apostles also left their blessings uponthe Patriarch and his household and next visited President Willard Richardswho received them in like manner and was saluted by themwith the happy new year. He also gave the Twelve hisblessing. He believed this the beginning of an eventful yearin the history of this Church and that each succeeding one wouldbe more and more so until the Coming of the Son of Man. Hesaid the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers andblessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the four cornersof the earth. They were men of God and were destinedto perform a great and mighty work upon the earth and they 
 should live till they were satisfied with life and see light and truth prevailover sin and tradition."The Twelve then went to the house of Elder P. P. Prattand there united with his family in singing the "Return of the Twelve"and other songs of Zion. The spirit and power of God rested upon them and their hearts were filled with praise and thanksgiving toGod in all their visits of this the new year of 1853.The bands continued their salutations throughoutthe city and their enliveing music was everywhere received with openears and hearts of joy.Dedication of Social HallDuring the evening the quorum of the Twelvewith the Presidency and about 200 of the Saints met with our familiesat the Social Hall and dedicated it to the purpose for which itwas built after which they went forth in the dance finishingtheir enjoyments of this new year's day.Sunday the 2nd Bro Joseph Toronto gave anaccount of his travels through Italy and the dangers he ran inpreaching the Gospel to his native country. He was among theWaldensees.On the following Sunday after an interestingdiscourse ^from P. P. Pratt^ brother Groward gave an interesting account of hismission on the Western Islands—of his travels among the natives,his sufferings among them, and the opposition by the FrenchGovernment. He was 9 years on his mission and several years without hearing anything from the Church and his mentalsufferings were very great. The first he received was a letterI wrote to him and that he did not obtain until two years afterit was written.On the Sunday Jan 2nd President BrighamYoung and Heber C. Kimball met with the quorum of the Twelveand the same subject was brought up and talked over as on the 29of December. President Young said the best way for the Twelveto get a living for themselves and families was to preach the 
 Gospel with all their might and "your means will come in your way. T.B. Marsh once said he did not know what Joseph called the Twelve forunless it was to abuse them and I told him if the Twelve were faithfulthey would soon see the day that they would have all the influencethey could weild."The President Young said laying plans in our presentsituation for perpetual cover was all a shadow. We may lay plans but they may be frustrated."The Legislature closed its session of the year on thenight of the 21st of JanuarySunday 23rd Orson Hyde preached upon the subject that the hand of God had been in the working out of the eventsand changes among the nations to prepare for his work—such as thereformation of Luther and others God's inspiring Columbus to thediscovery of America the invention of railroads telegraphs &c and in therevolutions among the nations. Parley P. Pratt and Amasa Lymanfollowed both advoating the same views.On the 26th Mrs Woodruff had a son born butit only lived two hours. I blessed it before it died and named itAphek. I buried it during the day in my garden.Sunday the 30th Parley P. Pratt preached afine discourse upon the subject of the Kingdom of God to be set upin the last days.Breaking The Ground For The TempleFeburary the 14th 1853This was an important day to the Saints in the Valleyand even in all the world.The Saints met upon the Temple Block in a vast body to break the ground for another ^Temple^. The people commencedgathering at an early hour and at eleven o'clock there were thousands 
 upon the ground. President Young and Council the quorum of the Twelveand many of the quorums of the Church were there and all the bands of musicin the City were in attendance.At eleven o'clock President Brigham Young HeberC. Kimball and Willard Richards got into a buggy inside the squaresurrounded by the quorum of the Twelve. President Young thenarose and addressed the assembly upon the subject of building TemplesI recorded it in my journal but it is published in the Journal of DiscoursesVol I[1].After the address of President Young Heber C. Kimbellarose and with uplifted hands to heaven offered up a fervant heart:feltprayer to God imploring his blessing upon President Young and his Councillors and all the authorities of the Church with the whole houseof Israel. He then dedicated the ground unto God and prayedfor his blessings to attend them in building the Temple and all thepublic works in Zion.At the close of the prayer the Presidency and Twelvewalked to the South East corner of the ground laid out for the TempleThe earth being frozen President Heber C. Kimball commenced breakingthe ground with a pick. Then President Richards did the sameand then Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff John TaylorAmasa Lymon Charles C. Rich Ezra T.

 the Apostleship except the Twelve or those who are ordained to that office.Amasa Lyman told a dream. He said that Josephcame to him and told him to dip a large lake dry and gave him aspoon to do it with.

Prayer was made to our Father in heaven after whichThe Choir sung "The Lord will comfort Zion" W. Woodruff arose & sd br. sis friends I arise bef u with very peculiar adoration & with a heart full of grati[tude] to my H Father—yes I rej[oice] that while the Temple of the Lord stands bef me [[a]nointed] to becomewe live in one of the most important periods since chaos rolled out & if I must have chosen my time to dwell on theEarth it is the time that we r now in, to live in an age of the world the most important we need no fiction forreality has spoken in the loudest thunders & we of all want to see from da to da the rise & progress of the Ch[o]f the LDS.  the many 1000s of S[ain]ts that r now dwellg on the Earth they have been seekg after this time even in the days of old.there r 1000s of S[ain]ts now bef[ore] me who have sought the same thing. the Gospel of J C. which he preached & tried to open the eyes of the Jews that they might see the Gos of their forefathers, & he even gave up his life in the [FIGURE]. I have perused the rev[elatio]ns of J. C  they were prin[ciples] that r set forth in divine truth. I am like one of old who sd Lord they have digged down the altars, &c [##1 Kings 18:30##] by & by Elijah found there were 1000 of similar S[ain]ts in existencewhen I became the El[der] of the L D S. I have heard within the last 12 yrs wt I never expected to see or hearI have seen & heard the great & grand miracles of the Gospel. it is true ye LDS have had to pass thru anarrow path, & you never cod rece an exalt[ation] if u never walked such a Roed. have the Bible the B of Mor& u will find they have had to walk the same road. it was their dom[inion] & exalt[ation] & glories & they overcameby their works on the Earth—all will centre in a grand focus. let us bear oppression, bec[ause] [ou]r lives havebeen harassed. others have been in the same way & the reward is at the end of the journey. there has beena miracle wrought in these days if there ever was one bef, in rearing a temple as it were with a swordin one hand & a trowel in the o[the]r while I have been away in the same labor of love we have sent up our prayers to our Fa[the]r in heaven in your behalf & we have end[eavore]d to bear off the word of the Lord & we havenot lab[ore]d in vain. the work of the L[or]d has never been more prosperous in England than at this timewe had represented in good standing bet[ween] 11 & 12000 & they r abu emigrating to Cal. they have only ourS[ain]ts in England all in review we have pub[lishe]d 3000 D. & Cs & sold 1000 bef[ore] I left. I sent the proclamation toall the m of [Parl], circulated it in Wales, to the Jewish [Nobles] we have not been idle in the LandI feel more & more conf[i]d every da[y] of my life & when the report reached us that they were burning out theS[ain]ts & rather than to shed blood to go to the Rocky mountains it made a revival among them & they felt as a general thing that it was fulfilling the B of MorI feel to say that I rej[oice] in the same faith & prin[ciples] that Ihave done for the last few yrs. I dont profess to preach here bec[ause] u have had the Shepherds of Israel to lead u& that in the B[ook] of M[ormon], D & C & every eternal principle that emanates from God & that we may have 
 a stronger connection with our God. I tell you, to have a connection with this while rather than with the throne of the world - try to [illegible] will be trials that are placed on us   remember we are not alone poor an brave are child of Israel & our fathers  I feel that we have fulfilled the command of God in building in the Temple& shall have your chidren in the Eternal world.  I desire a will while out in mission & as your girls are as have been saved before he comes & have not [we] redress now make them known to the great God his ears & open to the prayers of the Saints & the time will come we will be perfectly obliged for the trials thatwe have now - this is the 1st time that I have [addressed] you since the Temple has been [built] & it may be the last - I have desired for a long time that Priest & [illegible] Jew & Gentile may understand the principles I will sayas Paul once did that he verily thought he was doing God service, & when his eyes were opened he felt for his kindred & when I see that we leave now a good constitution, can shelter from the storm & when I see a daggerthrust into the heart of the eagle - I have been ashamed when I have travelled among the crowned headsof Europe & have been [wed] of the [hersn] & asked where is your [illegible] protection - but who can standin the end. In America stands in her own light, if the mormons were the only people that would sufferit would not be so much but [look] as Greece & Rome, & you see the workers of ruin over which this land stands I say they are here & my own country & my own Government will feel it - by & by it will fall on their own headswhen they have [us!] [Aha Aha] &c  Europe is making [capital] ^out^ of American mobocracy - I rejoice this morning & have the [will] of standing this day with my aged Fa. in your midst - I rejoice ... seeing so many of the Saints who are trying to overcome the world, keep their integrity,  let us [people] be faithful & seek Godlet us leave vengeance in the hands of the Lord & I am willing to risk my destiny with this people & wherethis people lives I will live &c & we are tied by the ties the strangest in nature - I am satisfied with the cause - as in [Zion]:  I have been sufficiently acquainted with the Counsel to remain & sustain every man in his place - I have tried to fulfil my mission to the best advantage -   I will say that while brother Hyde stays here I feel perfectly to coincide with my [btn] the 12 to give counsel. I want my [Cricen's] to receive his counsel & let it be an end of controversy while he remains with us - I am a passenger in your [illegible] - these are the feelings that I have this morning - the Lord has not forgotten his people - Zion will yet arrive & clothe herself in her beautiful garments I feel that I have got a little glimpse of the work of the last days the Lord has sworn that he will gather Israel & the foundation will yet be more glorious & they will again build Jerusalem & when the Gentiles reject that Gospel it will be time to take it to the Israelites by & by the 
 Lord will make a short work & any man ma[y] know that we [a]r[e] living in a very eventful age of the worldwhy have we been called to bear it? bec. there is no o[the]r pple in the world that would bear it. & who will make the Sac[rifice]—there is none? nowhere? bec the nearer p[eo]ple get to Jehovah, the more persecutionthey will have. W the further from God it will be [Carie Pellow] well met. br[other] & sis[ter] hold on to the end & youwill soon see the sign of the world & if a green tree will burn, how much more a dead tree. there is nothingever done within 600 miles of a LDS. but he has done it. not even an Earthquake or a flood butwhat is laid to the charge of a mormon. get into the [illegible] for the world has been tired of [yo]u longenough & [yo]u will be society for the while 13 cau of the Forest & the Savage – I say you ought to go awayfrom the U. S. & leave your log cabins & the [little shoulder] for a Temple – go away & let thosemen who are more industrious build better towns & let leave your miserable [always] behind forthe people of the great cities of Wausau & Carthage & get away as fast as [yo]u can fo as it is requested bythe trouble govr the old cit., the U. S & all others. I say to you go & I pray that [yo]u may understand thesigns of the times. & go into the Wil[derness] build up Zion in the tops of the mountains that all the worldmay come to [yo]u & I feel that [yo]u will all be satisfied when [yo]u get to the end of the race & may we wash our selves white in the blood of the Lamb 
 W. Woodruff called the r[eal]w[orl]d of our friends while I r[ea]d a few of the words from 15 ch[apter] of St. John"ye [are] my friends &c to from the beginning" the words which [struck] me were "ye [are] my friends (is I made known unto [yo]u"it offords me [th]is small [cons[olatio]n] & realize that I [[kn]ow] that I stand in the midst of the friends of the L[or]d.I've my reasons for bel[ieving] this, as that the S[ain]ts of God [have] lived in the da[y]s of Noah &c bec[ause] they held the command[ment]sof God & says the Sav[io]r ye [are] my friends if [yo]u do what I command [yo]u. The Saints [kn]ow not what the L[or]d doeth &Geo[rge] s[ai]d what my Fam[ily] hath told me even have I told [yo]u – one thing is clear in the cha[pte]r, if the S[ain]ts in theirlabor work &c is a God of rev[elatio]n however diff[erent] or great that work mi[gh]t be, that God was powerfulenough to sust[ai]n them in it rev[elatio]n appears to have been the foundat[io]n. if any man [h]as a command to do work& is not able to complete it he can go to his Mas[te]r - & ask to know [h]ow to complete it. rev[elatio]n appears to bea being which the world generally opposes - the L[or]d co[ul]d raise up a ri[gh]teous man in the days of old Noah 
 & men generly wise up. & sa[y] that rev[elatio]n was done awa[y] for it ap[ea]rs to be an offence by the sai[n]ts in theda[y]s of Christ.  we find the Jews very zealous in the rev[elatio]n that was written but when I began to presentany lit[erature] or [k]no[w]ledg[e] that was not previously [w]ritten they s[ai]d he is a false is a false teacher why need we any morefrom this new messiah – Jesus s[ai]d if you only bel[ieve]d it they wrote the very things belonging to me the verymoney that I must be sold for – the beast to ride into Jerusa[lem] – & he had power to ask his Fa[the]r & to ?1notwithstanding all his reason he co[ul]d not convince the Jews that his prin[ciples] were pure – the Messiah altho[ugh]he brou[gh]t forth the P[riesthood] & the fruits, & the gifts & graces & the teach[e]rs were ?2 among them but bec[ause]he did not come accord[in]g to the ?3 of the Jews – ^they did not bel[ieve] him^ but he placed that gen[eratio]n that then co[ul]d not site injudgm[en]t upon it – they loved darkness ra[the]r than li[gh]t – the world at large profess is love the Bible &c butthere was no harder words co[ul]d be heaped upon him than were – he was called a wine bibber &c so I say with?4 to the present age of the world there [are] no prin[ciples] that give greater offence to the world than rev[elatio]n – do notass[ume] Sp[irit] came from an Et]erna]l source – if so – I ask d[oe]s not the same sp[irit] require teach[in]g & feed[in]g from the samesource in ages gone by – if it req[uire]d rev[elatio]n to sust[ai]n Abel ?6 &c do we not need teach[in]g & feed[in]g from the samesource in order to accomplish the work ass[ociate]d ?7– we need that same or else the gospel of J[esus] C[hrist] [h]as ceased – if –they had need of rev[elatio]n in those da[y]s w[h]y did they need thes[e] to unlovk the truth – it is a prin[ciple] that directswith God from Et[ernity] to Et[ernity] – a rel[atio]n that [h]as not that connect[io]n with the God of heaven it will not ans[we]rmy purpose – a that ?8 sp[irit] that fills our bodies – we need teaching in order to [know] what our Fa[the]r willsconcerning us – the gospel of Christ was preached unto Adam Abel Enos, &c  it. gospel did they leachunto adam it was the sam[e] Gospel that moroni carr[ie]d in lhe midst of heaven – they required rev[elatio]nto guide them in their temporal sal[vatio]n – it req[uire]d Noah to build an Ark to save himself – if Lot [h]ad builtan ark it mi[gh]t [have] been burnt up – but fled to Zion – & when Jerusalem was encompassed – flee to themountains of Judea & so it is in every age of the world the L[or]d gives rev[elatio]n to suit their course – we as a[people] bel[ieve] in rev[elatio]n – bel[ieve] the L[or]d [h]as raised up a prophet Seer & revelator – we bel[ieve] the L[or]d [h]as ag[ai]n beganto reveal matters to the chil[dren] of men – he [h]as commanded us to build a house in Kirtland we ?9we went to the m[ountai]n there were commands given - they were driven from it & they were informed thatif they did they duty it sho[ul]d be accepted & he also give a command to build a house in this place thereis an object in completing this house it [h]as tried our faith & he has seen whe[the]r we will build the houseor else we shall be rejected with our de[a]d saith the L[or]d – where is the ind[ividual] who [h]as any faith in ser[vin]g?1 olrs?2?3prophesies?4reg[ulatio]nres[ervatio]n?5usin?6soul?7us?8?9 
 but that must feel stimulated – I ask [h]as not this [people] done better in the eyes of the L[or]dd thanif they [h]ad caused rivers of the blood of goats to run &c – they [have] [h]ad many persecutions trials &privations & sacrifices – they build a [h]ous[e] & complete it in the name of the L[or]d certainly Istand in the midst of a [people] who [are] the friends of God – I have the ?1 this day & ofspeaking my mind we [are] equally will[in]g that every p[er]son sho[ul]d enjoy their priv[ilege] we only askthe same bless[in]g & ?2 he commands us to rise up & build a [h]ous[e] to him we do it – I amthankful that [yo]u [have] been sustained – that these walls [are] completed that the power points toheaven & if we leave tomorrow & never enjoy it ag[ai]n we [are] accepted of God & that is rewardenough & tho[ugh] we [are] passing thro[ugh] one stage of existence – it is of great consequence that we[have] been sust[aine]d & so save ourselves & our de[a]d – Jesus s[ia]d inasmuch as we do the will of Godthe L[or]d J[esus] Christ reveals himself – we [are] not accountable to any man for it – immortal prin[ciple] emanating from God [yo]u cannot be deceived in this world or in the worldto come if [yo]u do one prin[ciple] that promise sustains us – he [h]as power to plow the ocean& do all things even if he [h]as to lay down his life – they [have] been insp[ire]d by the H[oly] G[host] to carrythe truths to the 4 Qua[te]rs of the Earth they [have] gone to carry their napsack with[ou]t purse of script[k]nowing that hte L[or]d will sustain him & that [h]as given yo[u] a view of this temple over yourheads this day – if the L D S [h]ad not done works that [have] o[the]r [people] [h]ad done – condemnat[io]nwo[ul]d not [h]ave been in the world & they will continue to do until all things [are] fulfilledwhich God [h]as prophesied by the mouth of the prophets of the L[or]d the hand of God [h]aspreserved us as a [people] & ma[y] the L[or]d God bless that man who has lab[ore]d on this houseas he that has sustained this [people] – [yo]u that has willing to put means into their handsto remove this [people] Jesus passed thro[ugh] a narrow street & ma[y] the L[or]d bless on that [people]who stretch forth their hands to assist us – & also those who go with this [people] that they ma[y]escape the wrath of their enemies – rev[elatio]ns [are] prin[ciples] of truth we [have] understood themfor ourselves & not for ano[the]r we [are] still very limited in the know – & instead of rev[elatio]n being I [shall] let li[gh]t rule from our Fa[the]r – can it be a sin that we aspire after the highest?1?2understand

 AFTER RECESS.MORMONISM.Sir JOHN THOMPSON continued hisexplanation of the clauses of the bill dealingwith Mormons.Mr. BLAKE thought it was not enoughthat they should apprehend what the attitudeof the Government was with reference to thepersons who had given birth to the legislative clauses before them. They had heard vari-ous rumours and words of encouragement toa section of people called Mormons in theNorth-West. These words of encouragementseemed to him out of place, if their doctrineswere what was represented. There were inOntario certain small scattered communitiesof the Joseph Smith school, who, so far as hecould ascertain, had proved themselves goodemigrants and obeyed the laws. They wereof a different class to those of the Latter DaySaints who had settled in the North-West.It was right to emphasize the fact of the diffi-culties that the State have had with theUtah Mormons, and that very strin-gent measures had to be adopted bythe Republic against their practices.This was in consequence of the extremesolidarity and determination of the people topersist in concealing the legal evidence oftheir abominable practices. As far as onecould judge, there was a disposition on a con-siderable part of these people to seek a morecongenial soil than Utah. It seemed to him thatthe settlement in the North-West was suchas to enable members on both sides to supportthe Minister of Justice to provide stringentlaws against such polygamous practices.The settlement called upon them to giveexpressions of discouragement rather thanapproval of such a colony in their midst. Heread from the will of Brigham Young, fromwhich a glimpse, he said, was obtained of theirmarriage customs. Simple cohabitation, inaccordance with the Mormon Church, seemedto be one of the principal, conditions of mar-riage. In the Judgement of Mr. Justice Ander-son, issued in 1889, he found that the beliefof the Mormons was that their Church was theactual and veritable kingdom of God onearth, that this kingdom was both temporaland spiritual, that it would overthrow theUnited States, that polygamy was a com-mand of God, and that the Congress of theStates had no right to pass any law antagon-istic to Mormonism, it was stated that theNorth-West Mormons did not live in apolygamous state, but it was stated thatthere was a suspicious disproportion of thesexes there. He had a letter from a friendin Utah, who was cognizant with the courseof events transpiring there, and he told himthat in some instances the Mormons who hadgone to the North-West had not broughttheir own wives, but that in such cases hadtaken each a fresh young girl. (Laughter.)He did not think that their friendsfrom the North-West should be eagerto promote settlers of this description. It was neither wholesome nor profitable.All that they could do was to put in opera-tion all the legal machinery they could forthe discontinuance of these abominablepractices. He thought they were bound tosupport the Minister of Justice in any reason-able attempt to stamp out this crime ofpolygamy. It should also be indicated inthe clearest language that it was not wordsof encouragement but words of discourage-ment that this Parliament had for Mor-monism.Mr. DEWDNEY said that some years agotwo or three of the leaders of the North-West Mormons visited Ottawa asking forconcessions from the Government. He hadone or two interviews with them. The ap-plications they made were not granted, butthey stated most distinctly that they had nointention of practising the tenets of theirfaith in the settlement. They gave the Gov-ernment the most abundant assurance on thatpoint. Since then there had been rumoursthat they had abandoned their promises.An effort had been made by the Governmentto ascertain if there was any foundation forthese reports, and through his deputy hecommunicated with the leaders of the Mor-mons in the North-West for explanations.They replied, and stated emphatically thatthey were not practising polygamy, that theymade a solemn promise when they went thereand they were determined to keep it.Mr. BLAKE—What were the nature ofthe concessions they wanted?Mr. DEWDNEY—They wished to be al-lowed to settle in communities in the hamletsystem, that is that they could live togetherand live in the communal system.Mr. BLAKE—The great difficulty withthese people is that they are being driven outof the States because laws are put in forceagainst them. There is no reason to supposethat they will abandon their practices here.It is a serious question.Sir JOHN MACDONALD—No doubt it is.Mr. BLAKE—They have to leave theirown country and settle here, apparently tocarry out their abominable practices. Whyshould they come here to obey laws whichthey have refused to obey in the States?Mr. DEWDNEY—They were fleeing fromjustice.Mr. MULOCH thought a more rigid penal-ty should be imposed. Under the bill amerely nominal fine might be imposed.Sir JOHN THOMPSON consented to im-prisonment being made the penalty forpolygamy.Mr. CHARLTON said that no encourage-ment should be given to the Mormons to cometo Canada. They were an undesirable element.Mr. McMULLEN said it was much to beregretted, that any inducement whatever should have been held out to these people.It was exceedingly unwise that the slightestencouragement should have been given to them. It would have been better to haveprevented them from coming.Mr. DEWDNEY—What inducements were offered to these men?Mr. McMULLEN—There was correspon-dence.Mr. DEWDNEY—We answer all letters.Mr. LAURIER said that these people wereofficially recognized.Mr. BLAKE—I understand that the Lieu-tenant-Governor visited the settlement andstayed at the house of Mr. Card, whose wifeis one of the numerous daughters of BrighamYoung.Mr. DEWDNEY—That was not inducing them to come to Canada.Mr. BLAKE—It was inducing them to stay.Mr. MITCHELL agreed that these peopleshould be compelled to obey the law, but hedid not think they should be prevented fromcoming to Canada.Sir JOHN THOMPSON said no encour-agement had been given to the Mormons tocome to Canada. They left Utah because,as they alleged, they were hardly usedgenerally and there was a prejudice againstthem. Therefore they sought refuge inCanada. Some of these people were British subjects by birth. They were told distinctlythat they must understand the people ofCanada would be as firmly opposed to polygamy as the United States were. Theyreplied that they simply wanted a refuge and were willing to submit to the law. Theydiscussed the matter generally and arguedwith him the principles of Mormonism, buthe told them there would be no leniencytowards polygamy.Mr. MULOCK said it was clear from this statement that the Mormons had entertained a hope of perpetuating their institutions inCanada.The clause was carried.The committee after passing a number ofclauses rose and reported progress.STEAMBOAT INSPECTION ACT
