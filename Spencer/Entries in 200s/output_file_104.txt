After the blessings were bestowed Brother Hiram Smith arose &amp; gave The Twelve some interesting advice and council considering it best to say nothing but repentance to this generation or at least to preach the first principles of the gosepl as that was as much as this generation could endure &amp; many other things he said of interest. Then Joseph arose &amp; presented some precious things of the kingdom unto us in the power of the Holy Ghost, yea precious principles that ought to be engraven upon our hearts &amp; practiced in our lives, some of which are as follows. Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy &amp; be ready to forgive our brother on the first intimations of repentance &amp; asking forgiveness &amp; should we even forgive our brother or our enemy before they ask it our heavenly father would be equally as merciful unto us, &amp; also we ought to be willing to repent of &amp; confess all of our own sins &amp; keep nothing back, &amp; let the Twelve be humble &amp; not be exalted &amp; beware of pride &amp; not seek to excell one above another but act for each others good &amp; honerably make mention of each others name in our prayrs before the Lord &amp; before our fellow men, &amp; not backbite &amp; devour our brother. Why will not man learn wisdom by precept &amp; example at this late age of the world &amp; not be oblieged to learn every thing we know by sad experiance.

Joseph addressed us in few words &amp; says remember brethren that if you are imprisioned Brother Joseph has been imprisoned before you, if you are placed whare you can ownly see your Brethren through the grates of a window while in Irons because of the gospel of Jesus Christ remember Brother Joseph has been in like circumstances also after other similar remarks the meeting closed &amp; three persons were Baptized &amp; confirmed which ended the duties of the day.    Lamb of God organized in these last days to go forth unto all the nations of the earth to prune the vineyard once more for the last time that the saints may be prepared for the second coming of Christ, &amp; that Israel may be gathered &amp; babylon fall &amp; the earth once more clensed from its pollutions &amp; wickedness swept from the face thereof FIGURE May the Lord enable us the Twelve ever to be meek &amp; humble &amp; to lie passive in this hands as the clay is in the hands of the potter &amp; may we ever realize that while we are in the service of God &amp; doing his will, that though we may be surrounds by mobs &amp; threatened with death that the Lord is our deliverer &amp; that he will support us in every time of trouble &amp; trial   ENDENTRY July 8, 1839       ENDENTRY July 9, 1839    my Journey.

We then had an interview with the Presidency &amp; also with Elder Kimble we went into the River &amp; had a bathe. We was called upon to visit the sick &amp; administer unto them by the laying on of hands. We found quite a number that were sick several received a blessings &amp; while administering in spiritual things Smith ^is 68 years of age this day^ &amp; lay hands upon him that he might be healed for he was sick &amp; nigh unto death we lade hands upon him &amp; he received ^6 sick^ a blessing the thought struck me that the Lord would add unto his life fifteen years. &amp; to close the scenes of this day, we received the glorious intelligence of the happy deliverence of  months for the cause of God. Brother Morris Phelps was also delivered with Parley. they delivered themselves on the fourth day of July about the setting of the sun by running over the  Jailor &amp; esscaping out of thir hands by mounting some horses that were prepared for that purpose by Phelps &amp; others. they were closely persued by the mob &amp; narrowly escaped by leaving behind them their horses saddles bridles &amp; hats &amp; arived in Quincy on the 10 making six days on the road. they are now all liberated but two persons  Luman Gibbs.

I crossed the river this morning with Elder Joseph Smith sen &amp; found him still vary sick we prayed with him &amp; layed hands upon him &amp; he received a blessing. &amp; after travling about two miles further, I had the happy privilege of once more taking Elder PARLE- Y. P. PRATT by the FIGURES hand, &amp; also Heber Kimble. Br Parley had just arived at Boon County Mo whare he had been confined about 8  months for the cause of Jesus Christ. I was truly glad to see him, in a short time Joseph &amp; Hiram &amp; others soon rode up to see Parley &amp; in fine it was a happy meeting I returned home to Montrose feeling thankful to God for his deliverance    ENDENTRY July 20, 1839       ENDENTRY July 22, 1839    the saints on both sides of the river &amp; Joseph went through the midst of them taking them by the hand &amp; in a loud voice commanding them in the name of Jesus Christ to  arise from their beds &amp; be made whole &amp; they leaped from their beds made whole by the power of God Elder Eligah Fordham was one among the number &amp; he with the rest of the sick rose from his bed &amp; followed Joseph from house to house &amp; it was truly a time of rejoicing    ENDENTRY July 25, 1839    &amp; fefer &amp; I find it a distressing dissease a number of the quorum of the Twelve are taken Ill the enemy is striving to bind us down that we shall not go into the vineyard    ENDENTRY July 29, 1839    system I took 3 emetics &amp; steamed 15 minutes I thought this would do for one day.

And after spending a few hours with them I took the parting hand with them &amp; among the rest our little Sarah shook hands with me. I shall not see her any more untill I return from England, may the LORD bless her I pray &amp; preserve her in health untill I return that I may see her in the flesh 6     ENDENTRY August 7, 1839    a sacrafice of my all for Christ sake to do his work. It is no small trial of faith to leave my family &amp; my all &amp; to start on a mission of four thousand miles to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth &amp; that to without money purs or scrip with the power of desease resting upon me even a shock of the fever &amp; ague every other day but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in him for the recompence of reward. May the Lord give me grace according to my day &amp; a safe return to my family which favor I ask in the name of JESUS CHRIST    ENDENTRY August 8, 1839    took my departure from the embraces of my companion to go on my mission She parted with me with that fortitude that becometh a saint realizing the call &amp; responsibility of her comp- anion.

I shall see thy face again in the flesh. I am gone to obey the command of JESUS CHRIST   ENDENTRY  Christ to the nations of Europe in fulfillment of the commands of God. Accordingly I left a parting blessing with my wife &amp; took my fare well of her &amp; other saints on the morn of the 8 of  my mission of about six thousand miles &amp; I started without purs or scrip and that to with the fever &amp; ague resting upon me every other day. I left in company with Elder John Taylor. we were the first of the quorum of the Twelve that left Nauvoo on this important but the rest expect to follow us immediately. we rode from Commerce across a 16 mile prairie &amp; spent the night at Br Merills distance of the day 18     ENDENTRY August 9, 1839    untill 12 oclock during which time I was suffering under the power of the ague &amp; fever &amp; immediately after the fever came upon me I got into the waggon with Br Perkins &amp; rode to McComb from thence to Br Carloss Smiths this was over a rough road of 25 miles &amp; I truly suffered much this day it seemed as though I should shake to peaces in the waggon with a heavy fever upon me. I spent the night in company with Br Taylor at Br Carloss Smiths. I commenced taking ^35^  ENDENTRY August 10, 1839   10. a box of Sapington's anti fever pills which are so highli recommended, for the ague &amp; fever as I do not wish to carry the disease any further with me. I attended meeting in the grove Elder Taylor Preached I followed him. Although I was weak in body, yet the Lord strengthened me. I spent the night with Br Carlos Smith    ENDENTRY August 11, 1839    I have esscaped it this day. I have taken 14 of the sappingtons pills &amp; they have entirely broaken the ague entirely to all appearance. I attended meeting in the grove &amp; herd a discours from Elder Samuel Smith &amp; communed with the saints and inasmuch as we were without purs or scrip, they contributed to our necessities to the amount of $9.
