 Malad City    July 12th 1895    Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother    I recieved notice  requesting me to take a mission  to the northern states and to  be ready to start by the 27th  of august 1895. While I feel  my inibility I dont wish  to shrink from the call ian  the least but I would like  to be excused for a while  longer as my condition and  circumstances are such that  it will be hard for me to  get ready so soon. If it  is satisfactory with you it  would please me vary much

 Washington June 12, 1854  Mr Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,    I have yours of  the 24th of April and 1st of May. I regret  that I have not as yet been able to honor   the draft in favor of Messrs Sanborn & Carter.  Gov. Young sent me claims against the  Government to the amount of several   thousand dollars, with the proceeds of which  he desired me to liquidate your claim,  as well as those of some others, but I have  hither to been able to collect but a trifling  amount of them. As soon as I can obtain  the means I will cancel the draft in question.  On Monday last another member of Congress  went to that "bourne from whence no traveler  returns."    Your friend  John M. Bernhisel    P.S. Always pleased to hear from you.  J. M. B.    2nd P.S. Since the preceding was written I find, 
 I am happy to say, that I shall be able to pay,  about the 1st of July next, on the draft in favor   of Messrs Sanborn and Carter, six hundred and  twenty five dollars. ($625.) J. M. B.    P.S. 3rd I shall send brother Cain another order  for money or goods, of which ^the latter^ I shall send you  some more this fall by brother Eldredge. If  you can sell the pen knives by reducing the price  you will please to do so.    [sideways text] J. M. Bernhisel June 12  Ansred Aug 1st 1854 [end of sideways text] 
 October 14, 1854    Dear Brother,  I will just acknowledge  the receipt of your letter of the 31st of  August. I am gratified to learn that  the back mails have at last reached  their destination. If Elizabeth should  want a little money from time to time,  please let her have it. The past sum-  mer has been excessively warm & dry.  Let me hear from you as often as you  can. I supposed that you have  learned ere this that your ^draft^ in favor  of Messrs Sanborn & Carter is paid  in full. In haste yours truly  John M. Bernhisel    Mr Woodruff

If you are  oblidged to leave home on a mission,  you may deposit the balance you  may have on hand with bro. Cain.    I will honor the draft in favor  of Sanborn & Carter as soon as I can.    In haste yours  very truly,  John M. Bernhisel    P. S. Please write me often. If you  remain at Salt Lake I may send  you a few more goods in the fall.    J. M. B

 DECLARATION.    As rumors have been circulated and  published, accusing the Presidency of   the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints with interference in politi-  cal affairs, so as to control elections and  to direct members of the Church as to  which political party they should sup-  port, we hereby declare these rumors  to be false and without foundation in   fact. We emphatically deny that we,  or either of us, authorized Mr. George  F. Gibbs or any other person or persons  to use our names so as to influence  citizens to vote the Republican ticket,   at Logan or elsewhere. If our   names have been used in any  such way, it has been entirely  without permission from us, and we   hereby condemn it as wrong and re-  prehensible. If we have any desire   in this matter it is that the people of  this Territory shall study well the prin-  ciples of both the great national par-  ties, and then choose which they will   join, freely, voluntarily and honestly,  from personal conviction, and then  stand by it in all honor and sincerity.  Each party should have the same  rights, privileges and opportunities as  the other. If any man claims that it  is the wish of the First Presidency that  a Democrat shall vote the Republican  ticket, or a Republican the Democra-  tic ticket, let all people know   that he is endeavoring to deceive  the public and has no authority  of that kind from us. We have no  disposition to direct in these matters,  but proclaim that, as far as we are con-  cerned, the members of this Church  are entirely and perfectly free in all   political affairs. But they should not  indulge in in ill-feeling or personalities.  President George Q. Cannon is absent,  but we are sure that if he were here he  would sign this declaration with us.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  JOSEPH F. SMITH,    Of the Presidency of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 ENCOURAGING WORDS FROM THE  FIRST PRESIDENCY.    SALT LAKE CITY, U. T.,  April 17th, 1891.    President Elmina S. Taylor and Counselors:    DEAR SISTERS: We have noted  with pleasure the advancement made in  your magazine, "The Young Woman's  Journal," and are aware of the great  mission it has before it among our  young sisters of Zion. We heartily  commend it to the consideration of the  young people, and will add that the   fathers and mothers in Israel may also  find profit in the perusal of its pages.    May God bless you and those as-  sociated with you in this important  labor, and may your efforts to en-  lighten and refine the youth of Israel  be increasingly prospered, is the prayer  of your brethren,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEO. Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 AN OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT.    On the 5th of the present month, to the great   surprise of the public, the following official en-  dorsement of Col. Isaac Trumbo appeared as a   leading editorial in the News. People were   still wondering what it meant when the Colonel   was made the topic of discourse in the Taber-  nacle last Sunday afternoon. Here is the letter:    There have been many communications of late   in the newspapers concering Colonel Isaac  Trumbo and his affairs. Charges have been   made, emanating from various sources, that there   has been some financial connection between him-  self and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day   Saints. It has been repeatedly stated in years   past, and the story has been revived of late, that   Colonel Trumbo has had large amounts of money   in his hands and under his control belonging to   the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;  that he has been its agent in the expenditure of   funds for the accomplishment of certain ends   that were desired to be achieved.    We have remained silent upon this subject.  It is well known that from time to time charges   are made and circulated concerning us and our   affairs, which we deem it unnecessary to notice.  It would be occupying too much of our time to   be contradicting stories which are put in circula-  tion by one and another for their own purposes.   This feeling has restrained us in the past in rela-  tion to Colonel Trumbo and his connection with   us and our affairs. But it seems to be proper  now, and just to ourselves, as well as common   justice to him, that we should say something in  relation to the association that has existed be-  tween Colonel Isaac Trumbo and ourselves as the   representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints.    First of all we wish to state most emphatically   that Colonel Trumbo has not had property of   ours in his possession FOR SUCH PURPOSESES AS AL-  LEDGED. He has neither been our financial  agent, nor had any control of our property. We   have not entrusted him with amounts of money   to expend for us FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE.    In the time of our deep distress, when bitter-  ness and hatred were manifested against us in   almost every public quarter, Colonel Trumbo  came to Utah, and showed interest in our affairs.  Some of his own relatives were involved in cases   that were then before the courts. One promi-  nent connection of his was consigned to the pen-  itentiary, on the common charge that was in   vogue against so many prominent Latter-Day   Saints. The colonel's sympathies, it seems,  were aroused, at least in behalf of his kinsfolk.  This caused him to take interest in the whole   question; and this interest absorbed him to such   an extent that he withdrew from profitable busi-  mess that he had at the time in San Francisco,   and devoted himself almost exclusively to the   labor of correcting the false impressions which   prevailed and to the enlistment of the press in   the correction of many falsehoods and asper-  tions which were in circulation; and afterwards,  on a wider field, using his influence with leading   men of the nation. We may say here that Colo-  nel Isaac Trumbo is a man of extraordinary ener-  gy. When he undertakes anything that he   thinks ought to be done, he is untiring in his ef-  forts to accomplish it. These characteristics   were wonderfully illustrated in the labors which   he took upon himself in behalf of the maligned  and misreprhsented Latter-Day Saints. Being a   man of means, HE WAS ABLE to travel from place   to place, and especially to visit and SUSTAIN HIM  SELF at Washington. We can never forget his   activity in visiting editors and using his influence   to correct public opinion through the press. No   man could have dislayed greater zeal and disin-  terestedness than he did in the labors that he   took upon himself. We felt that he was inspired;   for, not being a member of our religious organi-  zation, and HAVING NO FINANCIAL ENDS TO ACCOM-  PLISH that would be remunerative to him, there   was nothing to incite him to these extraordinary   exertions except a purely philanthropic desire to   defend an oppressed and unpopular people and   to roll back the tide of calumny and evil that   threatened to overwhelm them. We felt thank-  ful many times for the kind Providence that   raised him up; for he seemed to come to our aid   when a man in his position and with his indefa-  tigable energy was especially needed.    When the Mormon people were threatened  with disfranchisement, Col. Trumbo spent con-  siderable time in Washington, exerting himself  to the utmost of his ability to defeat that infam-  ous measure. And while there were other   agencies also at work (for every one that had any   influence in the community realized how neces-  sary it was that this measure should be defeated),  still Colonel Isaac Trumbo was the means of   bringing powerful influences to bear against the   enactment of that villainous bill. In the defeat  of the proposed legislation every member of our   Church had cause to be deeply grateful to the   Lord and to the instruments which, under Him,  were the means of bringing it to naught.    With the same zeal and devotedness he   worked untiringly to obtain the amnesty; and   also afterwards in securing the return of the per-  sonal property to the Church, and in preparing   the way for the return of the real estate.    He threw himself into the accomplishment of   all these ends with an energy and wholeness of   soul that won him many friends and crowned his  labors and the labors of those who worked with   with success.    Colonel Trumbo was most fortunate in win-  ning the respect and admiration of influential  men in the nation. By his representations of the   condition of things in the then Territory of Utah   and his enthusiastic defense of the Mormon   people, he aroused the active interest and sympa-  thies of very many of them. This was notably   the case with General James S. Clarkson. This   gentleman was deeply moved by all that he  learned, and he entered with his whole soul and   great influence, with Colonel Trumbo, into the   effort to make the true character of the people  known to the nation and to remove the wide-  spread and deeprooted prejudices which existed  so generally at that time against the Mormon   people. It would be invidious perhaps to at-  tempt to give names of other leading and influen-  tial public men who, by the powerful appeals  which were made to them, were induced to ex-  amine what was known as the Mormon question   from a different standpoint to that which they   had occupied; but their names are cherished in   grateful remembrance by the men of Utah, and   their deeds will be preserved in the history   of the people. All the influence which he had   gained by personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo   used to make the people of Utah better known to   the nation at large, and towards preparing the   way for the admission of Utah as a State. It is   not necessary for us to go into details concerning  his labors in this direction; it is sufficient to say   that probably no single agency contributed so   much to making Utah a State as the labors of   Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his immediate friends.    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff said the time   in which we live is the most interesting   era in the World's History — a time in which work can   be performed both for the living and dead; a dis  pensation in which a great many things that   have been hidden shall be revealed. To fullfil the   purposes of the Lord in placing us here should be   uppermost in our minds. He felt anxious to have   the people do as much as possible for their dead.   With regard difficulties that may arise let us   settle them between ourselves. "Go to law and you   build up the lawyers only." 
 Pres W Woodruff addressed the Saints saying When the Lord  contemplates doing any work on the earth He always prepares an ele-  ment to accomplish it. Referring to himself, he related his own ex-  periences in his youthful days, when he was animated by the spirit   of enquiry after truths. In due time the Elder's of the Church came  along & preached the Gospel. He at once received it & was bap-  tised. He was prepared to receive the Gospel when it came. He  had lived to see Apostles & Prophets, the gifts & blessings of the  Gospel made manifest among man & he hoped every young man  & woman would seek after these things & Search after the things  of the Lord. He referred to the Priesthood & its potency for good am-  ong men, without which no connecting link can be made between  earth & Heaven. He referred to the 121st Section of the Book of  Doc & Cov which states that but "few are chosen" to be vessels of the  Lord & He remarked his experience in preaching the Gospel with  out purse or scrip & he had hoped that all the Elders would do so  likewise for wherever he did so, the Lord had blessed him greatly.  He set forth that it made no difference what Priesthood a man  holds, if he will magnify the same, the Lord will sustain him  as much as He will an Apostle. He was not in favor of ord-  daining so many Elders to be Seventies thus decimating the Elders  quorums &c. He urged that every man who holds any Priesthood  should magnify the same honestly before the Lord. He  spoke approvingly of the operations of the Female Relief So-  ciety as an organization. He gave counsel not to ordain our  young men to higher positions in the Priesthood until it was  apparent that they have magnified that which they have had.  He impored the blessing of the Lord to rest on the people. 
 Pres W Woodruff said, No sect was free from the union of Church & state  than was our church. In England our Elders have always respected the   government & the officers have always protected us. This is Mormonism   to sustain any government where we are that will sustain us. The   Prophet Joseph always taught that the Saints should sustain the   government & laws of the United States. Had the policy of the Pro-  phet been carried out in regard to slavery the civil war would   have been avoided. Ours is the grandest government founded   on the most just constitution of any country on the earth, but if   it takes a cause to break a its constitution a people will be found  here in these mountains who will be inspired to save that constitution. 
 Pres Woodruff again spoke directing his remarks in relation to  the Sugar Factory & explaining the et ceteras involved in this raising  of vast Sums of money. He hoped the Saints would assist all in  their power towards erecting the Factory. He explained the object  of the Defence Fund & hoped to live long enough to see all the debts  of the Church paid up. Benedication by Pres F D Richards    James A Leishassman Stake Clerk 
 Pres Woodruff said, In regard to the Manifesto. He thought he  understood our people & situations. The plans were laid to take our  Temples from us & stop our Sacred ordinances & they would have  accomplished it, had not the Lord told me to give the Manifesto    It was contrary to my personal feelings, & I would not have taken  the step without the inspiration of the Spirit. My Counselors  & the Apostles have the testimony for themselves. This does not mean  that any man should neglect or cast aside his wives or children  any more than before. In honoring the law, families must not  be cast aside

 Mr Woodruff  Filmore  U T 
 Comstock, Kalamazoo, Co. Michigan, June 1st 1844    Father & Mother Woodruff,    Dear parents.    I feel Disposed to address a few  lines to you to infoerm you that I have commenced my Summer  work ie to attend a long list of Conferences which lie through the western  middle & New England States. You probably may have seen the list of  coferences which we publish in the Times & Seasons, but lest you might  have missed of it I will make metion of it here. The following places  the quoroum of the Twelve were Expecting to visit. Quincy, Princes Grove, Ottaway  & Chicago, in Illinois. Comstock, Pleasant Valley, & Franklin, Michigan.  Kirtland, Ohio. Lockport, Batavia, Portage, Hamilton, Oswego, Adams, London,  State of New York. Boston, Salem, New Bedofrd, Mass Petersboroug N. H. Scarborough  & Vinal Haven, Maine. Westfield Mass July 27 & 28 (Farmington Aug 3th.  New Haven July 13, ^&^ 14, Aug 10, ^&^ 11, Canan Aug 17, 18 Norwalk 24, 25, Connecticut)  New York City, Philadelphia, Washington City Sept 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.  Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, &c. I Expect to attend those Conferences on most  of them especially, Westfield Farmington & New Haven so you may Expect a  visit from me the first of August I shall be thare on the 3 & 4th if the Lord will & probably  some of the Twelve with me; I dont know what a chance their will be for a  Conference in Farmington but I thought I would appoint one any how &  pay you a visit of nothing more, for I do not intend at any time to  go through New England without calling at my fathers house. We understand  that the work is prospering well in the regions of New Haven so it will be  necessary to hold a conference there, & we have approved an Elder to go to  Hartford that will be capable of meeting any thing that that City can present.  Perhaps the people in Farmington would like to come out to attend one of our  Conferences & some good might be done. I should be pleased to have  Uncle Ozem Woodruff to be there & as many of his family as feel disposed Aunt  Hannah &c. Aunt [Anna Hart Cossett|Cossett & Betsey, Bulah &c if they are alive & able & all who have  any friendly feelings. I have not heard from Aunt Cossetts family since  I herd from Betsey By letter which gave a distressing accoung of her mother. I  have often remembered her in my prayers but know not how she is  Neither have I herd any thing from Dwight & Eunice since they wrote  me that they were coming west I suppose they have gone but know not  I moved my family into the new house the day before I left. I  got two rooms done off & the rest of the house is not finished for I 
 Could not get seasoned lumber, but they can go into the  house we mooved out of untill he can lay a floor in a room in  the new House & then they will comfortable. I left my family well  & in good spirits, my life & lot seems to be mostly in the vineyard  I left Nauvoo about the first of May in company with Elder G. A. Smith  one of the Twelve, to attend the Conferences. I expect to meet with Elders  B Young & H. C. Kimball at Kirtland Ohio. Elders O. Pratt, O Hyde,  J. E. Page & L. Wight are in the City of Washington with petitions  to Congress & preaching the gospel, we all have a general Conference there  of about a week in month of Sept. It has been a vary wet spring  in this western country, we have traveled most of our time since we  left home in the raine mud & water. We have held meetings in all  the large towns & villages on our route & delivered both religious & political  lectures & prejudice is giving way like a flood all through the Country.  we have held our Conferences thus far & had a good time. I am now in  the midst of the Comstock Branch of about 50 members & surrounded by about  40 Elders from Nauvoo & other parts as good spirits as ever breathed ready to open  a conference in a few minutes. Perhaps some of our friends abroad  think strange that we are engaged in political matters & running a candidate  for the presidency, but when they hear our reasons for thus doing they will  see we are fully justified. Our polittical lectures have done much good in  Breaking down Prejudice in fine the whole western world is open to investigate  our principle, & the kingdom is rolling on. I expect if Br Webster &  Eunice is gone you are some lonesome, so if I pay you a visit now it  may fill up the vaccum of their abscence for a day or towo. I feel anxious to  see you again, But I must lay down my pen & go to conference.    June 3rd. Monday We have had a good time for two days past. we have had an  interesting Conference, their being 36 Elders present including the Twelve,  High Council, High Priests, & Elders, the work is progressing rapidly on  Every land. We had an interesting conference at Nauvoo {shorthand}  the 6th of April Before I left, the most interesting probably the Church  ever held. About twenty thousand persons were present & it  was judged their was three thousand Elders present, many Clergymen  of different Denominations attended. President Smith preach  a great Sermon upon death, resurrection & Eternal Judgement, which  presented great & glorious ideas to the mind of man. many Embraced  the work on that occasion. 
 I should be pleased to meet all our friends or relations at  your house that have faith in the work, but if I see no more  it will be a consolation to meet my father & Mother, the longer  I live, the more advanced you are in life the more I essteem it a   favor to look upon your faces, & when I contemplate the thought  that you are like Old father Jacob not ownly bereaved of one Son  but of evry Son & Daughter & left alone to pass away your feeling  declineing hours in silence with not a child to see or know  your cares, it at times causes me sorrow, but then again  that sorrow is checked with a certain knowledge that it is my priviledge  to meet with you in the first ressurection & enjoy a mansion in  the Celestial Kingdom of God with my father & Mother & Brother  & as far as I have any influence with the kingdom of God, it shall  be used to accomplished this purpose, the more I understand  as touching Eternal things the ^more^ interested I feel in the welfare  of my kindred, I have quite a desire of late to feel atfeafter.  Br Azm[on][page torn] & Thompson I trust before they die to see the[m][page torn]  in the c[ove][page torn]ant. I know the more a man understa[nds][page torn]  the gospel, the Keys & Kingdom & Eternal things the more his he[page torn]  will be sealed to his Parents & his Children, this was the spirit that  characterized all the prophets & patriarchs from Abel to  Zachariah; I would like to spend more of my life in your  company, but I am not ownly sacrificing the socity of my  parents but my wife & Children for the great work of this  dispensation. I have not herd from Br Azmon I that  since he wrote you while I was East I intend to write him  a letter as soon as I get time. If Dwight & Eunice is  with you my respects to them of course. I feel anxious  to learn about them, if you can have an opportunity of giving  notice to Sister Betsy I should be pleased to see her at the Farmington  Conferece, I dont know how her Mother is, or how she will be  situated, give my Respects to Sister Hooker & Jennett & all the  Saints or friends who inquire after me, I dont know  but your will be troubled to read my writing, for I have  written in great heaste & surrounded by many many.  As Ever I am yours with respect    Wilford Woodruff

 [sideways text] Artha Stanyers  On Sugar  Oct 20 [18]87  Answered Oct 20 [18]87  Stayner [end of sideways text]    Salt Lake City Utah  Oct 20th 1887    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother    Pardon me for again intruding upon  your time and attention, but the magnitude of  the interest involved and the exigency of its imme-  diate handling must plead my excuse.    The days of doubting and experiment in the ^Sorghum^  Sugar Industry are gone by and are superseded  by actual knowledge and an output which  places the business as one of the most impor-  tant and for some years to come the most profit-  able of all home industries.    Seeing the fruition of my hopes and experiences  in the success of the Fort Scott Factory and wishing  to know of a surety with regard to the truth of the  Statements made, I took my son Horace with  me and visited the works at Fort Scott; We saw,  during three days we remained there, for ourselves  the actual demonstration of the successful man-  ufacture of Sugar from the Sorghum Cane by 
 Salt Lake City, Utah,  August 22, 1887.    President Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Twelve:    Dear Brethren;    I am constrained to address you and ask your  sanction and approval to my opening up and publishing  a Paper dedicated to the interests of Producers generally,   but especially the Farmers. During the past few years,  I have given much attention to the interests of Agriculture,  and I have long been convinced of the utility, acccoun-  ting to a necessity, of such a publication. My interest  in behalf of the Producer aids me to see that there are  not within the reach of the Farmers of this Territory the  means of instruction and learning peculiar to their  business that are ordinarily accessible to persons of  their class in other States and Territories. There   being no local publication devoted to their interests  exclusively they are at the mercy of foreign adven-  turers, who palm off upon them cheap and com-  paratively worthless publications which are gotten up 
 Diffusion. We saw the cane brought in on the  farmer's wagons, weighed, conveyed into the Factory  and watched it through all the processes and the  sugar came forth ready for market.    We also verified the statement with regard to  output by information from the Company's books  showing how many tons of cane had been received  up to date and the figures of the sugar realized  we obtained from the book of the Kansas State  agent who certifies to the amount entitlled to County  of which the State pays 2¢ per lb. Comparison  of these two amounts shows a little more than  100 lbs of sugar to the ton of cane; the sugar  averaging from 92 to 98% sweet.    The business in Utah covers an annual outlay   of about one and a quarter millions of dollars and  will pay a profit of from 20 to 40% on the capital  invested. For the Servants of God to control a business  of this magnitude is surely an object of interest so  long as we are not fed with manna from heaven  but have to supply our temporal wants by the  use of the elements placed under our control and 
 so long as it is expected that "the Church shall   stand independent of every creature beneath the  celestial world"    Our friends on the outside are ready to grasp  this thing unless it is taken up by this people.   I have been solicited to write on this subject, since  my return, for publication but have withheld  from doing so awaiting an interview with you.    If it be altogether impracticable to accord  me an interview, would you like to appoint  a Committee of one or more, say Bro James  Jack and Bro Clawson to investigate my  statements and report to you    Very earnestly and respectfully submitted  Your Brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner 
 and thirty five lbs to the ton.    This advance isn output is due, primarily, to the principle  of diffusion as a means of extracting the saccharine from  Sugar producing plants, and next, to certain patented  processes which I have the control of in this Territory.    I now earnestly crave the privilege of an interview at  your early convenience, that I may lay before you some  matters pertaining to this vast & valuable industry.    Very respectfully    Your Brother in the Gospel    Arthur Stayner 
 on purpose to carry the advertisements of Quack Doctors and  "bogue Jewelry" Manufacturers, and which have been in-  dustriously circulated amongst the Farmers and others of  this Territory; the chief attractions of these papers being their  low cost, a few items of information called from good  publications, and one or two "blood and thunder" stories of  the lowest and cheapest style.    I think that a paper devoted to the interests of our Farmers  Manufacturers, Stock, Sheep & wool raisers, calling forth   correspondence upon practical matters locally important,  and giving in a concise and condensed form the   best and most appropriate ideas from foreign journals,  and bringing before our producing population some  easy grades of scientific information for their develop-  ment, and paving the way for an Agricultural  and Mechanical Institution in the near future,  would certainly be much more desirable than the  trashy & in many instances improper literature ^from abroad^  to which the people are now sedulously invited to   subscribe. The lack of such a paper as I propose  to establish is so manifestly felt that, doubtless, 
 Arthur Stainer  Oct 12th [18]87  Answd Oct 13 [18]87  Stayner 
 if the want be not supplied from some controllable source  within a short time, it will be supplied by some such party   as the Chamber of Commerce or some other party having  money making solely, and not the true interests of the people,  at heart.    It is the furthest thing from my wishes to Endeavor to  work up or Encourage a Boom here; I have not got  the same desire as the Chamber of Commerce in inducing  foreigners to come here to locate, my interest is solely  and entirely to benefit those of our faith who are here  because of their faith, and many of whom not finding  here the trade or work to which they had been apprenticed,  and with which alone they were familiar, have been   forced into the ranks of the Farmers, unskilful and  ignorant of the secrets of the soil; to such, a little palpable  reasonable, plain instruction given in the spirit of a   wellwisher would assuredly be a help. And to   all, some hints and instructions in advance  of their present information would be invaluable, leading  them along from one improvement to another in the  skilful manipulation of the Elements of nature, would 
 in a short time manifest a marked improvement  in those important interests, Agriculture, Stock and  Wool raising and Manufactures.    Through a source of this kind, statistical information  regarding the quantity and kinds of produce raised could  be collated and disseminated to the profit of producers, who,   if well posted, would frequently bend their energies in a  direction which would supply a demand unprovided   for instead of adding to an already plethoric supply  of some common article sold, because of its quantity,  below the cost of production. It seems to me to be very  palpably evident that branches of industry soin which   the people of the Territory are so largely interested should  be and are worthy of the publication of a paper devoted  principally if not exclusively to their interests.    I therefore propose, if I can meet with your approval,  to publish such a paper, monthly to commence with,  at the nominal cost of $1.50 a year, having been in-  formed and feeling assured that the people will warm-  ly welcome such a paper and support it liberally.  And in return for patronage I will devote an un- 
 deviating and sincere interest to the paeople's true tem-  poral welfare, and by careful research and prudent  study place before them such instructions, hints and   suggestions as shall make a marked improvement  in the results of their labours.    I trust you may see fit to give this undertaking  your countenance and blessing    Very respectfully  Your Brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner

 Jesus, the Holy was controlled by  the Philestine and Egyptian  Powers Theosophy teaches the conat-  ion I told you my Father formed  in likeness of the spirits of God there   was a new spiritual Power coming  into Existance, from the works  of the spirit from God Cooperating  with the Republacin Pertie and   the Latterday saints, that spiritual  bodie was killed by two Powers that  came from the North and got controll  of the latterday saints, this Witchcraft   afect can give Philistine spirits power  to get Controll of Evry Nation or Holy  Power I see there is quite a large  spiritual Bodie Maturing from   the spirit from the Derk watter giving  some Power which I believe t[o] be  the Philistine spirits and the Devil  Power to conroll the Minds of the  People to do those terible Murders  there is a man and his 17 yeer old   Daughter in Jaol in Decorah for killg  his wife People think the Daughter asis-  ted in the Murder.

 History of Wilford Woodruff.  (From his own pen)  In tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficult  to obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family, for more  than three generations.      My ^Great^ Grandfather, Josiah Woodruff, lived nearly one hundred  years, of age and possessed an strong iron constitution and performed  a great amount of manual labor nearly up to the time of his  death. His wife's name was Sarah; she bore to him nine  children as follows;— Josiah, Appleton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda,  Phebe and two names not given.      My Grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of  [page covered] he was born in Farmington, Hartford Co., Connecticut  [page covered] he◊ father ^also^ possessed a strong constitution; it was said, that  [page covered] d the most labor for several years of any man in  Hartford Co., and from over exertion in hewing timber he was  attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, which caused a severe  lameness, for several years before his death. He married Dinah  Woodford by whom he had seven children as follows, vizt. :— Eldad  Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, He-Ellen and Ozem.      Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Elizabeth, Amasa Frisby;  Samuel, Miss Case; Aphek, Beulah Thompson and Hannah ^Azubah^ Hart; Titus,  Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos Wheeler; and Ozem, Acksah Merrill and Hannah  Hart; all of these had numerous families, unions were productive  whom had large families.      My Grandfather died in Farmington, with the spotted fever  in 1806, aged 55 years. My Grandmother, Dinah, Woodruff died in  1824, in the same place, with a cancer in the left breast: her  sufferings were very great.      My Father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in Farmington  Nov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah Thomson, who was born in 1782,  Nov., 29, 1801. She bore to him three children ^sons^, ^namely:—^ Azmon born Nov., 29,  1802; Ozen Thompson born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born March, 1, 1807.      My mother died with the spotted fever, June, 11, 1808, aged     
 26 years, leaving me 15 months old. My Father's married for  his second wife, Azup^b^ah Hart, was born July, 31, 1792; they were  married Nov., 9, 1810; and ^they^ had six children,. vizt.:— Philo born  Nov., 29, 1811;, and died by poison administered by a physician Nov.,  25, 1827; aged 16 years; Asahil Hart born April, 11, 1814, and  died in Terrahaute, Oct., 18, 1838; aged 24 Franklin born March  12, 1816, and died June 1, 1816; Newton born June 19, 1818,  drowned Sep. 1820; Julius born April 22, 1820, and died in  infancy; Eunice born June 19, 1820^1^. I married her to Dwight  Webster in Farmington Conn. Aug. 4, 1841.       My father, Aphek was a strong constitutioned man, and  has done a great amount of labor. At 18 years of age, he commenced  attending a flouring and saw mill, and continued about [page covered]  [page covered] t of this time he labored 18, in each 24 hours hours a [page covered]      He never made any profession of religion, until [page covered]  him with all his household into the church of Jesus [page covered]  Latter day Saints on the first day of July 1838. He [page covered]  man of great charity, honesty, integrity and truth, and made himself  poor by giving to the poor and accommodating his fellow-men  by loaning money and becoming surety for his neighbors, and   always saying yes to every man who asked a favor at his hand      I was born in the North part of the town of  Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford Co., Conn. March 1, 1807.  I assisted my Father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I  was 20 years of age. / In the Spring of ^April,^ 1827 I took the flouring  mill of my Aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I attended three years.  In the Spring of  ^May,^ 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr.  Collins, the ax manufacturer, in south Canton, Conn., at the end   of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery.  In the spring of ^March,^ 1831 I took charge of the flouring mill owned  by Mr. Richd. B. Cowleys of New Hartford, Conn. In the Sp^r^ing ^stet^  of ^stet^ 1832, in company with my oldest brother Azmon, I went to  Richland, Owego Co., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill,  and settled down in business for ourselves.      At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious     
 History of Wilford Woodruff concluded  heading for printers    Chapter of Accidents  written G. S. L. City February, 1858    Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunes  of men, while the paths of some are strewen with   flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave  with naught to disturbe their peace, others apparen  tly are marked victims of variated misfortunes,   accidents, and dangers; the last named class is   the one, in whose ranks I have stoood stood, thro'  my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood, up to   the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though   some invisaible power or fate was watching my   ^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take   my life from the earth; I can only attribute   the continuation of my life on Earth to the present   time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been   stretched out and rescued me from death in   the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth   escapes, I have passed through, some of   which I will here mention. When 3 years of age   I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly   caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was   nine months fbefore I was considered out of   danger. When at 5 years of age, I fell from the great   beam of a barn rafters ^striking^ my bare face upon the   floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three   months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling   down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other   arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile   of timber. When six years of age, I came near   being killed by a surly Bull. ^see people apart^ and was only saved  by as it were by a miracle, ^¶^ dDurring the same year, I went into my fathers saw mill, with several   others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride   while the carriage was running back, not anticipating   any danger, but before I was aware, my leg was caught 
 between the headblock and the fender post, and broke   both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the   house and lay nine hours before my bones were   set, which time was spent amidst ^suffering severe pain, but   being young my bones soon knitt together and in   a few days, I was again upon my feet; during   my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., Thompson,   was my companion in the same room going through with   a course of the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was   riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,  Ozen Woodruff, was driving to the barn, he turned   the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for   the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^¶^At 8   years of age ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with   several others, the horse took fright ran down a   steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but   again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-  served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years   ^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon   a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon   my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin   ran and told my parents I was dead; before they   arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met   my parents ^them^ coming to me. When 12 years of age   I was drownd in Farmington Rriver, and sunk   in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person   to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved   by a young man named Bacon by diving to the   bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to holld hold   him down until he obtained my body, not expecting   to save my life ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to   life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through Farmington meadows, in the   depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in   an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and 
 subjects, although I never made an ^outward^ profession until 1830; I did   not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find   any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with   the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the   Apostles taught.  Although the ministers of the day taught that   the faith, gifts, graces, miracles ^& ordinances,^ which the ancient saints enjoyed   were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe a word of  it, to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of  the children of men; I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and   power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another,  when God had a church upon the earth, & I believed ^that^ the church   of God would be ^re-^established upon the earth, in my and that   I should live to see it.  Thies^e^ principles was^ere^ rivetted upon my   mind from two causes; first, from the perusal of the old and   new Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me   what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-  tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the   whisperings of the spirit of the Lord for the space of three years   taught me in accordance with the written word of God that   He was about to set up His church and kingdom upon the   earth in the last days. / and secondly, I was taught thies^e^   principle ^things^ from my youth by Robert Mason, an aged man,  who lived in Simsbury, Conn.; who was frequently called the old   prophet Mason,: he taught me many things which are now  coming to pass. / he      He did not believe that any person man upon the  face of the earth had authority to administer in the ordinances  of the Gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer   and fasting to heal the sick, and cast out Devils by the laying on   of hands, which was the case under his administration as many   could testify.      I was looking for the coming forth of the truth when I  heard of what was called Mormonism.  In 1832 I was   inspired to go to Rhode Island, an my brother, Asahel, was  also directed by the spirit of God to go to the same place     
 when we met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us   to wonder and marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of   us in Rhode Island; but as we had made preparations   to move to the West, we let outward circumstances control us,  and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went   to Richland, Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until   the 29th day of Dec., ^29,^ 1833, before ^when^ I heard Elder Zerah Pulsiper   and Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Azmon and I believed   their testimony, and invited ^entertained^ the Elders home and offered our-  selves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the   book of Mormon and I received a testimony that it was   true.      I learned that Elders Sam. H. Smith and Orson Hyde were  had preached in Rhode island in 1832, which accounted for the  reason We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode   Island, for at the time we were warned of the Lord to go there,   two of the Elders of the Latter day Saints were preaching there,  and had we gone, we certainly should have embraced the   work at that time, but as it was we had to wait for  the next call.      Dec. 31, I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; and ^he^   confirmed ^me^ the same evening.      Jan. 2, 1834 I was ordained to the office of a Teacher,  and my Eldest brother, Azmon, an Elder, and a small branch organized   of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.       In Feby. following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked   some 60 miles to the town of Fabius to attend an evening meeting   of the saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding; I   saw the book of commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith,   and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein, and after   spending several days with them, and holding several meetings, we returned   home rejoicing. ¶ During the winter, we were visited by several of the   Elders among whom was Elder Harry Brown; He again who called  upon us again about Feby 1st, accompanied by Elder Parley P. Pratt   called upon us and instructed the branch, he spoke till near midnight     
 overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled   into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the   distance seeing me go into ^it^ the tree hastened to my   rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did  when he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and   was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing   me to a sense of my situation, he procured means   to carry me to my father's house, and through   a kind providence my life was again preserved.   At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax   which went nearly through my foot; and it was 9 months getting   well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand   by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only   dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood &   I was again preserved through the mercies of God   from an awful death. At the age of 17, I met  with an accident which caused me much suffering  and came near ending my life, I was riding a   very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted   with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the   horse took the ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly   leaped from the ground ^road^, and ran down the   steepest part of it ^the hill^, amid the roughest of the rocks   at full speed, and commenced kicking up at   the same time, and attempted to throw me over   his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top   of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with   a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed   to pieces among ^against^ the rocks, while in this position   sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide   him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under   full speed until he ran against a rock, which ^and^  dashed him to the ground. I went over both his head on   and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground   square on my feet, being the only thing visible that 
 saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part   of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was   my bones crushed from under me as though they were   reeds, it broke my left leg twice in two places and   put out both my ankles in a shocking manner  and the Horse came near rolling over me in his   struggles to get up; my uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw   me fall got assistance me and carried me to his house  I lay from 2 O'clock ^pm^ till 10 at night without medical aid   then my Father arrived bringing Dr Swift of Farmington   with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried   me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;  my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention   and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches.   In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a   water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm   around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and   let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the   water struck the wheel it ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel   I immediately plunged head long foremost over the   rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water and my   weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should   have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to   death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring   mill in Collinsville Ct. I was standing inside of a breast   wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the   top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water   was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my   ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by   the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom   of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone   wall with only about 2 feet of water clearance   between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and   rolled me out into the water below where I found myself   with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright.

Smoot  & Jesse Turpit, I spent the winter in of 1835,,  in Kirtland, received my Endowments, and attended the  school taught by profeser Haws who taught Greek  Latten & English Gramer, I confined myself mostly  to Lattin & English Gramer. This Winter & Spring  in some respects was one of the most interesting in  the History of the Church considering the Endowments &  teachings given and the Apostisy which followed  I was Married to Miss Phebe Whittemore Carter  on the 13 Day of April 1837, I received my patri-  archal Blessing under the hands of president Joseph  Smith the patriach on the 15 day of April 1837  I felt impressed ^By the spirit of God^ to take a Mission to Fox  Islands, on the East of Maine a country I knew  nothing about I made my feelings known to  some of the leading Apostles and they advised me  to go, so on the 
 : we had a precious time. He was upon an important mission to  gather up a company to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied brother  Pratt to Jefferson Co., ^&^ I told him my circumstances; he said it was my  duty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and join the camp of Zion.    I immediately went to work with all my might and settled  my business. ¶ April 11, 1834, I ^with my^ biad^e^ my friends farewell, and took a pair  of horses and wagon, and took with me ^I took^ brothers Harry Brown and  Warren Ingales, and started for Kirtland, Ohio ^Zion^. I met with Orson Pratt,  John Murdoch and other Elders on the way and arrived in Kirtland  on the 25th day of April 1834.    I was introduced to The prophet Joseph, who invited me  to make his house my home; which kind offer I accepted, ^his offer^ and staid  with him about one week. I became acquainted not only with the  prophet Joseph, and his family but / with ^stet^ many of the High Priests  Elders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many  of the Elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and  knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.    May 1, I started from Kirtland, and went to New Portage,  and remained till all the company joined us, when we were organized.  ^¶^ March 7, we took up our line of march, pitching our tents by the  way, and travelled to Missouri.    After we had pitched our tents in Clay Co. (our numbers being  205) and many of the brethren had been taken sick, and some had  died, Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except enough to take care  of the sick; all who had teams were required to leave the ground  go among the brethren, I went to bro. Lyman Wights', in company  with Heman Hyde and Milton Holmes. After Shortly, Joseph called  the brethren together at Lyman Wights', and told them if they would  humble themselves before the Lord, and covenant to keep His command-  ments and obey His counsel, the plague should be stayed from that  hour, and there should not be another case of the cholera in the  camp. The brethren commanded covenanted to do this and the  plague was stayed and there was not another case in camp.    Prest. Joseph Smith returned home ^to Kirtland^ with many other of the   brethren, I remained with Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till the 
 During the winter of 1831, while in New hartford, Ct.   I passed through a severe fit of sickness course of   lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized into the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints; one of my horses, newly   caught ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck   2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly,   in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team   down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom   boards slipped forward under the roller and caught   the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses'   backs, ^throwing me between^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the   hill dragging me by ^with^ the lines, head foremost with   the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth   snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the   midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in   Zion's camp in Mo. a rifle was accidentally discharged   and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men   in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a   man was standing behind it, it ^and^ injured no one   ^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many   others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months   afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accidentlally snapped   with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a few  few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it   had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire   and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839   in Rochester Ills. I was riding upon the running   gears of a wagon without a box, I was sitting upon   the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening   the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and   my weight on the forward bolster and tongue  turned the copuling pole, clear over onto the   horses backs, turned the stakes upside down 
 The ^W. Woodruffs^ Englands Missions of 1840  Joseph Smith the prophet asked the Lord what   his will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord   answered in a revelation given July 8, 1838  in which the Lord says Let them take leave   of my Saints in the City Far West on the   26 day of April next on the building spot   of my Home saith the Lord, Let my servant   John Taylor and also my servant John E Page   and also my servant Wilford Woodruff and also   my servant Willard patriarch be appointed to fill  the places of those who have fallen and be   officially notified of their Appointment.    It will be observed that different from nearly   all other revelations in the instant a day & date  was given and place was given for the commencment   of this Mission and when this revelation was   given all was peace & quiet And in Missouri & at   Far West but before the time being for the fulfillment  of that revelation The Saints of God had been driven   out of the State of Missouri into Illinois under 
 following winter.    I had a great desire to t^pr^each the Gospel, which I did not  reveal  to any person ^name to my brethren^, but one Sunday evening I retired into the woods  alone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way  to go and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of the Earth; the  spirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness unto me   that my prayer was heard, and should be answered. I walked  arose from my knees happy, and walked some forty rods through a  thick wood into an open road, as I entered the road, there stood before  ^&^ me^t^ Elias Higbee, a high priest, with whom I had staid for a number  of months, but had never said any thing to me about preaching or  ordination, but now as I appouched^roached^ him, he said "bro. Wilford the  spirit of the Lord tells me that you should be ordained and  go on a mission." I replied, "I am ready."    At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wight's,   Clay Co., Mo. on Nov. 5, I was ordained a priest ^by Elder^ under the hands of    bros. Samuel^imeon^ Carter; Stephen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde, were ^also^ ordained  Priests at the same time.    Bishop Partridge said he would like to have me go into  the Southern States, through Arkansas, Tennessee & Kentucky, &c. ^&^ if I could  find any body who had faith enough to go with me ^to take^ for it would  be a dangerous count^r^y to travel in at present, in consequence of the   Missouri persecution, ^to take him.^ I told him I was as ready to go South as any  where, and asked if I should go through Jackson County, as it lay direct  on our route, he said ^replied^, it would be at the risk of life, and he  had not got faith enough to undertake it; if I had, I might  try it. I also asked him, if I went through Jackson Co., if I  should start without purse or scrip according to the law of God,  Hee he replied answered, that he had not got faith enough to start  on a mission through Jackson Co., without money, and if I did it  I must do it on my own faith, I felt strenuous to keep the  commandments, so I started without money; I called upon Elder Harry  Brown, and asked him if he would not ^to^ accompany me; it met ^he consented,^  his wishes, and Bishop Partridge gave appointed him to go with me    Jan. 13, 1835, I received an honorable discharge from Lyman 
 and shut me up fast, ^between the bolster and tongue^ but in such a manner   that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground   my horses took fright and ran out into an open   prairie and thus dragged me in this possession ^position^   for about half a mile. I managed to guide them   with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner ^of a high worm^  of the fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was   considerably bruised but escaped without any broken bones.   On the 23rd July 1842 Prest Joseph Smith sent   me to S from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a   stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat was   6 days on the way, during which time I was severely   attacked with billious fever. The day I made my   purchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible   of what I was doing, as soon as I made my   purchase, and got my freight on board, I took my   birth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo, which  was on the 10 of Aug.st. I was confined to my bed 40   days and passed through the most severe fit of   sickness I ever endured, my life was dispaired   of by many of my friends; I was administered   to by Prst Smith and the Twelve: my life was   preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse   twice after I began to recover, once while in council   with the Presidency & Twelve, my strengths left me   my breath stoped and I felt as though I was   struck with death.   On the 12th Sept 12, 1843 I left At 5 o'clock p.m. I   left Boston, on the express train for Portland  while passing through Chester woods 6 miles south [of]   Kennebunk some person having pried up ^raised^ the ^one of the^ rails  and put under them ^rolled^  a log, ^under it^ and it being dark  the we struck it at full speed and landed in  a pile of ruins. 3 cars were filled with passengers 
 The time having arrived for me to start on  my mission I did not tary at home one year  according to the Law of Moses after having married  me a wife I ownly tarried one Month & 18 days   and on the 3rd May 1837, I took the parting hand with  my wife whom I left at with Sister Hale, where she  was expecting to tary for the season. After parting with  other friends I Kirtland left Kirtland in good spirits  and walked in company with Johnathon G Hale  12 miles to Fairport was there joined by Elder Milton  Holmes we went on board of the Steamer  Sandusky went to Buffaloo and by the Erie Canal  to sary Syracuse. We walked from there to Richland,  Oswego Co where I met my two brothers whom I had  not seen for several years after spending one night there  we continued our journey on foot to Sackets Harbor &  crossed Lake Ontario on the Steamer Onida to Kingston  Upper Canida we took a steamer & traveled on the               canal to Jons Falls & walked to a place called Bastard  Leads county, where we found a Branch of the Church received up  by John E page & James Blakesly, we accompanying them to   their place of meeting and attended a Conference with them  the conference consisted of 300 members of the Church 
 under the Edict of Gov Boggs and the Missourians  had sworn that if all the other revelations of   Joseph Smith were fulfilled that should not be  as it had a day & date to it and they would see  that it should not be fulfilled. It almost seemed  as though the Lord having a foreknowledge of what  would take place had placed a day & date to  that revelation to see whether the Apostles would  obey that revelation at the risk of their lives  when the time drew near for the fulfillment of  this commandment of the Lord Brigham Young  being then president of the Twelve (As Thomas B.  Marsh had fallen) He called the Twelve together into  [illegible] then at Quency Illinois to see what our  Minds would be about going to Far West to  fulfill the revelation Father Joseph Smith the  patriarch and others who were present did not  think it wisdom for us to attempt it as our  lives would be at stake and thought the Lord  would take the will for the deed But when  president Young asked the Twelve what their feelings  were upon the sub[ject] [page torn] We all of us as in the voice 
 Wight, I certifying that I had faithfully performed my duties in Zions'  camp. I took my    On this day I took my valise in hand, weighing 15 lbs., mostly  books of Mormon, and started in company with Elder Harry Brown,  we ^&^ crossed the river into Jackson Co., and bowed our knees felt thankful.  to God; we bowed our knees, and prayed that God "might protect  us from the mob while going through the country, and that His  judgements might rest upon the wicked who had shed the blood  of the Saints in that land, that the land might be cleansed from  sin. I bore ^had^ a, Petition to the Governor of Mo., for redress of  wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson Co., for the purpose of obtaining  signatures unto it. We bent our way south, through Jackson Co., without  any harm molestation; yet, in one instance, we were miraculously  preserved from a mob of about 60, assembled at a grog shop,  which we had to pass.    June 18, we called at the Harmony mission and had an  interview with the President, a Presbyterian minister; althoug^h it^ was near  sun down he would neither give us any thing to eat, nor lodge us,  because we were Mormons, it was 15 miles to the nearest house,  which was Jerrews Indian tready trading house; we asked the  minister to direct us there; he gave us directions, but the spirit  said to me, he was deceiving us, I asked him three times, and  he declared he was telling us the truth. ) We followed his directions  and we arrived ^came^ at ^to^ the Osage river swamp, where we were lost  in the darkness of the night; we followed the river, but as it is  one of the most ^very^ crooked in America, we made ^but^ little progress. After  travelling through mud and and water for one hour, we concluded  to go out on the open prairie and lie down in the grass until  morning, but when we got out into the prairie we heard the  Osage Indians drum and shout at the trading house as they were  having a Pow-wow, we followed by the sound and went into  their midst; As we approached, we were met by a dozen large  savage looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly manner, but  did not attempt to bite nor bark; we arrived about midnight,  covered with mud, hungry and weary, and were kindly received 
 Joseph Smith presided at a Conference held at   Quincy Ill on the 6th May 1839 where it was resolved   that 15 of the Seventies Names given also 5 High priest accompany  the Twelve to Europe only two out of the Twenty fulfilled   the mission. May 9th Joseph Smith left Quincy with his family   for Commerce Ill. on the 9 May and arrived on the 10th &   sleped with his family in a log home nearly all of the Church  who were driven from Missouri soon followed the   prophet to Commerce, Ill. On the 9 11 June Joseph   Smith commenced dictating his History to his Clerks, who   wrote for him. On the 15 May 1839 I left Quincy Ill. and   started with my family for Commerce Ill I ownly drove  to the Committee House & spent the night. 16th Brother Brigham   Young & myself started with our families & drove 15 miles   & camped for the night, and on the night of the 17th, we  camped on the bottom of an open prairie. We arrrived in  Commerce on the 18th, and called upon Brother Joseph   Smith & his family. I also say many other old friends   who had been driven from place to place yet   th[e]y felt well, & were not discouraged but felt to   trust in God. The Saints felt determined to ^try to^ build  up a City wherever they went, Commerce was beautiful  for situations yet there was but two or three buildings  in the town. After spending a short time visiting old   acquaintances I crossed the Mississippi River in a   ferry boat and landed in Montrose Iowa. This   was the first time I ever was in the Terr[i]tory.  Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by the  United States Army. It contained about  12 blocks of  buildings making about 75 rooms in all. After spending  the night in Doctor Gallands office, I moved my family   and effects into a room on the west side of the public  square. This room I occupied untill I started upon   my mission for England and my family occupied it  after my departure 
 and their lives were saved, by having a long   train of freight between the passenger cars and the   engine, which ^all of them^ were mashed to pieces, the engineer   was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken   I escaped unhurt.   On the 5th day of Oct 1846, while with the Camp   of Israel building up winter quarters on the west   side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country,) I   passed through one of the most painful and serious   misfortunes I ever of any of my life I took my axe   and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to   cut some shingle timber to cover my shanty cabin   I was accompanied by two other men and while   falling the 3rd trees ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft   diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also   to one side the same distance, where I thought I   was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell   there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll   on the ground when the whole body shot endways   back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the   tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several   feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me   in its bound and caught me against the standing   tree and I came down between the them, before   reaching the ground I was liberated from them   and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed   my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip   also ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone   also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs,   vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner.   after the accident I sat upon a log until Mr  Mo Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my   horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had 
 of one man said the Lord God had spoken and  it was for us to obey, It was the Lords business  to take care of his saints and we would  fulfull the commandment or die a trying. According  to our revalation on the 18 April 1839 I  took into my waggon Brigham Young & Orson  Pratt and Father Cutler took into his waggon  George A Smith & John Taylor & George A Smith  On the way we overtook John E Page who was  on his way with his family to Quincy Ill His  waggon had turned over and when we met him  he was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soap  with his hands, we helped him right up his  waggon he drove down into the vally below  and accompanied us on to far west. On the  night of 25 April we arived at Far West and spent  the night at the Home of Morris Phelps who was  still in prison On the morning of the 26 April  1839, Notwithstanding the threats of our Enemies  that the revelation that was to be fulfilled this  day should not be and Notwithstanding that  ten thousands of the saints had been driven out of  the state by the edict of the Governor 
 and entertained for the remainder of the night by Mr. Jerrew,  who had an Osage squaw for a wife; she prepared us a good  supper, but marvelled that we did not drink coffee; she pro-  ffered us their best bed, which was highly ornamented, but we de-  clined ^ her accepting her kind offer, as we were wet and muddy;  she then made us a good bed of Mackinaw blankets before a  large fire, and we slept comfortably. May the Lord reward  both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Presbyterian minister accord-  ing to their deserts.    19th, Mr. Jerreu gave us a good breakfast, put us accross  the Osage river in a canoe, and was we started upon our long  day's walk, it being 60 miles to the nearest house; and we had not  a morsel of anything with us to eat; most of our travels through  the day was through prairie; before dark we entered timbered land,  as we approached the timber a large black bear met us; we  had no weapons^.^ but a small pistol, when the bear got ^within^ about  6 rods of us, he rose upon his hind feet and examined us  a short time, then turned and went another off. We were  soon enveloped in such thick darkness ^that^ it was with great difficulty  that we could keep the road, we ^&^ were soon surrounded with ^by^  a large drove of wolves, that ^which^ kept up a continual howling, and  would frequently rush upon us, coming to within a few feet  of us, we travelled about two hours in this situation, feeling that  we were in danger, and concluded to stop and build a fire  and wait till morning; accordingly we built a large fire which  drove the wolves off, and as we were about to lie down, we heard  a dog bark and a bell; we felt assured we were near a  house; each both of us took a brand of fire, and on going  about one quarter of a mile, we came to a log hut, which was  occupied by Mr. Williams, who had been in Jackson Co., during  the mobing of the Saints;, he ^&^ had lately moved here depending  upon his gun mostly for his living, it was 60 miles to a   house on the North and 12 miles on the South; him ^He^ and his  family were living in a small old log hut, about 12 feet square,  and one bed in the room, upon which lay his wife, several children 
 there were 32 persons presented for ordination which I  was requested to ordain in company with Elder Wm  Draper we ordained 7 Elders 9 priest, 11 Teachers  & 5 Deacons. We spoke to the people several times during the  conference. At the close of the conference we were called  upon to administer to a woman who was possessed  with the Devil she at times was dumb & greatly  afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in her  She believed in Jesus of Nazareth and in us as his  servents, and wished us to administer to her  four of us laid hands upon her head and  commanded the Devil in the Name of Jesus Christ  to come ^depart^ out of her, and it was immediately done  and the woman arose with great joy and gave thanks   and praise unto God for according to her faith she  was made whole from that hour, a child  also that was sick was made whole by the laying on  of hands according to the word of God see ##Mark 16:17|Mark 16 ch 17.##  we walked 30 miles to visit another Branch of the   Saints at Leeds where we met with John Goodson  & John Snider. We held meetings & bore our testimony  the to the people. A Sister Carns presented unto us two  of her children who were sick one a such lay child lay at  the point of death I took it in my arms presented it to 
 Nauvoo August 1st 1840  had to mount^ed^ my horse and ride ^rode^ 2 1/2 miles, over a  very rough road and had to dismount^ed^ twice  in consequence of miry places, my breast and  vitals were so badly torn to pieces that at each step of  the horse the pain went through me ^like an^ arrow; I continued  on horse back until I arrived at Turkey Creek  on the north side of Winter Quarters I then became  exhausted and was taken off my horse and  carried to my wagon in a chair; I was met in  the street by Prests Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball  & W. Richards and others who assisted in carrying  me to ^my^ family; before laying me upon my bed, the  Presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my  suffering and distress in the name of the  Lord, and said I should live and not die, I   was then laid upon my bed in my wagon  and as the Apostles prophesied upon my head  so it came to pass. I did live and not die. I   employed no physician on this occasion but  was administered to by the Elders of Israel  and nursed by my Wife. I lay upon my bed  unable to move, until my breast bone began  to knit together, which commenced on the 9th  day, I began to walk about in 20 days in  30 days from the time I was hurt, I again  commenced to do hard labor.    On the 21st day of April 1856, I innoculated  my arms with poison and mortification ^ensued^; while  assisting to remove an ox that had died from  poison and had been skinned; the poison worked  through my system for seven days before it  showed itself outwardly. on the 28 my arm began   to swell, was in great pain and showed signs 
 and though the prophet Joseph & Hyrum Smith  with other leading men were in the hands of our  enemies and in chains & in prison still we  moved on to the Temple Ground in the City of Far West  and held a council and fulfilled the revelation  and commandment given unto us, and among   other things that we performed at this Council we  excommunicated from the Church 31 person who  had apostetized from the Church and turned to be our  enemies. The mission of the Twelve was sung  we then repaired to the South East Corner of the  Temple Ground and with the arrival of Elder ^Alpheus^ Cutler the  Master workman of the building Committee, we  laid the South East ^Club^ Corner of Stone of the Temple  according to revelation there were present of the  Twelve Apostles Brigham Young Heber C Kimball  Orson pratt John E page and John Taylor who proceeded  to ordain Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  to the office of the Apostleship and as members of the  Quorum of the Twelve in the place of those who had  fallen as they had been called by revelation    Then vocal prayer was offered up in the following order  Darwin Chase & Normon Shearer  Brigham Young Heber C Kimball 
 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having been  sick for several days, & his home & door yard containg many  of the sick saints who had been driven from Missouri. Joseph  rose from his bed with the power of God resting upon him  and he took the sick by the hand & in a loud voice  commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to  arise & be made whole & he healed all that were  in his house & around about he then took some  of the Twelve with him & walked up the River bank  about a mile & healing all that were sick as he went  along & they were many among the number was Elder  Sherwood who lay at the point of death. He crossed  the River to Montrose went into the home where Brigham  Young lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the  home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was   standing & told me to follow him I did so we  then went into the home of Elijah Fordham who  was at the point of death, his friends had looked  for him to breath his last for several hours, he  had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walked  into the room Brother The Joseph took brother  Fordham by the hand & looking the dying man in  the eyes for several moments. He then said Brother Fordham  in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comand  you to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet  was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole  home shook from its very foundation. And the man  leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously  He kicked his poltices off from his feet, dressed himself  eat a boll of bread & milk & followed us out of the house  I went into the House of Bates Nobles who was also  very sick the prophet healed him & we knelt down & prayed  & gave thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeing  the power of God and followed to see what the end would  be. After the prophet had healed, all the sick saints in  Montrose he with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 and three young dogs, he lay stretched out upon the bare  floor with his feet to a small fire, there was no door to the  house, but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way; it was   past 11 o'clock at night. I turned away the quilt, looked into  the house, every thing was in sound sleep,  I ^&^ spoke three  times; no one stirred, not even a dog. I walked in and laid  my hands upon the man's shoulders, and spoke to him; the moment  he felt the weight of my hand, he leaped to his feet, and commenced  running around the room, leaping as high as he could each jump.  I told him not to be frightened, as we were travellers and friends  and did not wish to hurt him, but wished to stop with him  over night; when he came to his senses, he gave us permission to  stop with him till morning, if we would take the bare floor,  as he did, we asked for something to eat, as we had walked 60  miles without a morsel of food; he replied, he had nothing for us,  and assured us he had to kill game for his breakfast in the  morning. He informed us that the reason of his fright, was ^ in   consequence of his having shot a large panther dead a few nights  previous standing in his door, and he thought his mate had  lit upon him. We lay down upon the floor, and we were  glad of this place as it soon began to rain, and rained  through the night.      In the morning we arose, and went on in the rain 12  miles to a Mr. Conner's, who was also in the Jackson county mob;  he gave us breakfast, but damned us while we were eating because  we were Mormons, when we had finished f a hearty breakfast, we thanked  him very politely, and went on our way leaving him swearing; we  felt thankful for breakfast, for we had walked 72 miles without  eating food. We continued travelging, preaching by the way, without ^taught from house to house^   stopping, only over night. as we journeyed.      Jan. 24, I preached at Mr. Nathan Tanner's in Green Co.  Missouri, the first time we had found a congregation during our  journey, that we could converse, and preach to, in safety, and the first  time that I had ever attempted to preach ^as a missionary.^ to a congregation in the  capacity of a Priest or missionary, I had great liberty and was     
 the Elders who laid their hands upon it and it was   healed & I presented it whole to its Mother. It was healed  by the power of God in the name of Jesus both children  were healed and the parents prasied God for his goodf  goodness. After leaving the Saints in this place we returned  to Kingston crossed Lake Ontario in company with Isaac  Russell ^John Goodson & John Snider^ who seemed constantly trouble with evil  spirits Broth Russell These three Brethren continued with  us to Schenectady where they parted with us to go to   New York to join Elders Heber C Kimball & Orson Hyde  on their mission to England to preach the Gospel  After leaving these Brethren we traveled by road to  Abbey and walked from there to Canaan Conn whare  we found a Branch of the Church including Jesse & Julian  Moses & Francis ^K^ Benedict. We held a ^2 days^ Conference with  the Saints in Canaan I ordained Julian Moses &   Francis K Benedict Elders. After holding several Meetings   in the Town of Colebrook and visiting my half sister  Eunice Woodruff who was teaching school ^on the 6 July^ I visited Avon  Avon the place of my birth I visited many of my  former Neighbors & relatives and the Grave of   my Mother Bulah Woofruff the Daughter of Lot  Thompson who died June 11, 1808 aged 26 years  The following vers was upon her tomb stone 
 Darwins Chase and Norman Shearer (who had   just been liberated from Richmond prison) were   also ordained to the office of Seventies. The Twelve   then offered up vocal prayer in the following order   Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, Orson Pratt John E Page   John Taylor Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  After which they sung Adam^on^di Aman and then the   Twelve took their leave and parting hand of the following   Saints agreeable to revelation viz A Brother Elias   Smith, Norman Shearer, Wm Burton, Stephen Pecke,   Artemusia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah Granger  Theodore Turley, Hiram Clark, & Daniel Shearer,  Then we took the parting hand of this small remnant   of Saints who remained on the Temple ground to see us   fulfill this revelation of God and commandment of God,   and turned our back upon Far West and Missouri  and returned to Illinois, and we accomplished this mis-  sion without a dog to move his tongue on any man   to say why do you so. We reached Quincy crossed the   Mississippi river on the steem ferry & entered Quincy on the   2nd day of May and we all had the joy of receiving our   families once more in peace & safety un There was an   incident unaccounted with our journey well worthy of record  that while we were on our journey to fulfill the revelation   Joseph the prophet & his companions in chains had got 
 of mortification I showed it to Prest. Young who advised  me to cleanse my stomach immediately and put  on onion poultices and any thing that would draw  the poison from my system into my arm, which  I counsel I immediately put into execution. the  29th was another trying day to my life, the poison  had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system that  my strength left me I could not stand, I was led  to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to  act, my speech was like that of a drunken man  Prest. Young called into company with Dr Sprague  and laid hands upon me and rebuked the disease  and the power of the distroyer which had sceized  my body and promised me in the name of the  Lord, that I should not die but live to finished  my work which was appointed me, upon the  Earth. I soon began to recover; the poison and  mortification left my body system and centered  in my arm, and was drawn from my arm  through the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened  with a strong decoction of wormwood rag weed  and wild sage; the dead flesh was removed  from my arm with instruments and lunar caustic  and in a few days I was well again.    I have occupied considerable space in refering  to those peculiar circumstances, which have attended  me during life, and to sum the matter up, it stands  thus: I have broken both legs, one twice in two ^in two places^, both  arms, both ankles, ^dislocated^ my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^  I have been drown^e^d, froze, scalded, and bit by  a mad dog; have been in two water wheels under  full head of water; have passed through several  severe fits of sickness; & encountered poison in its  worst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruins 
 followed by Elder Brown: during our preaching there was a hard snow   storm.      We arrived at Petty John Creek, in the Arkansas Territory, where   Mr. Alexander Akeman resided with a large family of sons and one  daughter, all of which who^m^ were settled around him, Mr Akeman, ^stet^ was a  member of the church ^he^ and a part of his family, were members of the   church in Jackson Co.; his wife died strong in the faith in Mo.; & his   whole family were mobbed, and some of his sons were whipped severely;   but he could not stand the persecution and the loss of his property,  he moved to Arkansas to get rid of Mormonism, had apostatized, and   was bitter against the work; when we called upon him, he opposed   us strongly, — spoke against the leaders of the church and the book of   Mormon, he had one son who received us, and had a little faith, I   had a ^the following^ dreamed the night before I ^we^ went there. concerning what we should  meet with, and what would transpire. " I dreamed that we were re-  quired to walk in a strai^gh^t narrow path, and while following the path   it lead to the door of a house, which was placed in a high wall which ^that^ we   could not get around; as I opened the door to go through, I saw the  room ^was^ filled with ^large serpents.^ snakes, I proceeded ^entered,^ and they all coiled up to jump   at me; as they made a spring to bite me, they all fell dead at my   feet, turned black, swelled up, burst open, took fire and were consumed   before my eyes.      We met with much opposition not only by ^from^ Mr. Akeman   but from ^&^ many in the neighborhood, Elder Brown wished to leave   the place immediately; I told him I should stay and see my dream   fulfilled. We staid in the neighborhood 25 days, during which time,  the Lord brought judgment upon those who threatened to mob ^& kill^ us;   many of them died suddenly, while we were there, and I was   warned three times by the Lord to go to Mr. Akeman and bear   testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism and the wickedness   of his course in opposing it, and the last time I called upon him   he was filled with wrath against me, and when I left his house   he followed me in a rage, apparently with some evil intent; when I   had got a few rods from his door, he was nearly treading on my   heels, he ^&^ fell dead at my feet, as though he had been struck with     
 A Pleasing Form, a generous gentle heart  A good companion just without art  Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend  Beloved through Life, lamented in the end    At the close of the day I walked 6 miles  to Farmington where my Father Aphek Woodruff  was living, and I had the happy privilege of  on[c]e more meeting with my Father & Step Mother  which I had not seen for some seven years they  received me with great kindness and it was a happy  meeting. After visiting my Father a day or two I  returned to Avon where most of our relatives lived  lived and held meetings with them and on  the 12 July 1837, I baptized my Uncle Ozem Woodruff  & his wife Hannah, & his son John and we rejoiced  together for this was in fulfillment of a dream I  had in 1818 when I was eleven years of age  We all rejoiced together. On the 15 July I had an  apointment to preach at my Uncle Adna Harts  while there I had the happy privilege of meeting  with my wife Phebe W Woodruff who had  had come from Kirtland to meet me & accompany 
 The Testimony of Wilford Woodruff  Before closing this little book as a reader for our  Children, I wish to bare my testimony to  upon several principles to the Latter Day Saints  especially to the rising Generation, the young men of  Israel. First I wish to speak of the spirits  of good & evil the Lord says whatsoever leads to   do good is of God & whater leads to do evil is  of the Devil, this is a very important subject for   us to understand the scriptures again tell us  that there is many spirits gone out into the  world and we should try the spirits to know what  is of God & what is of the world only. The new testament  says that ery spirit that confesseth that Jesus is the Christ  is born of God, & ery spirit that denyeth that Jesus is the   Christ is of AntiChrist & is not of God, I will also add  that evry spirit that confesseth that Joseph Smith was a   prophet of God, & that the Book of Mormon, Bible & Doctrine  & Covenants are true is of God, and ery spirit that denitheth  denieth this is not of God but is of the evil one I wish   here to ask our friends the question as well as older     
 have barely been missed a ^the^ passing bullet, and  have passed through a score of other hair-breadth  escapes. It has appeared miraculous to me, that  with all the injuries and broken bones, which  I have met with ^had^; I have not a lame limb about  me, but have been enabled to endure the hardest  labor, exposures and journeys, have often  walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in a  day. The protection and mercy of God has been  over me and my life thus far has been preserved  for which blessings I feel to render the gratitude  of my heart to my Heavenly Father; praying  that the remainder of my days may be  spent in his service and in the building up  of his Kingdom. 
 liberated through the blessings of God from his enemies   & prison and passed us not far distant from each  other without either party knowing it, they making their   way for their families in Illinois while we were making   our way to Far West into the hands ^midst^ of our enemies   so they arrived home to their families & friends before   our return. May 3rd was a very interesting day to   me as well as others. In company with 5five others   of the Quorum of the Twelve we rode four miles   out of town to Mr Clevelands to visit Br Joseph   Smith & his family we arrived at his home & once more   had the happy privelege of taking Br Joseph by the hand   two years had rolled away since I had seen his face.  He greeted us with great joy as did Hyrum and   Lyman Wight all of whom had escaped their imprisonment   to gether they had been confined in prison six months   and been under sentence of death three times, but yet  their lives were in the hands of God and He had  delivered them and they were now mingling with their   wives children & friends and out of the reach of the   mob and Joseph was frank open and familiar   in ◊◊◊d our rejoicing was great. No man   can comprehend feel, sens or understand the joy   or sensation that is created by such a meeting 
 lightning; he swelled & ^immediately^ turned black; this created a great wailing   and mourning among his family. Brother Brown and myself assisted   in laying him out, and burying him; he died Feby. 14th, 1835, and   we buried him on the 16th.,      This singular dispensation of providence brought solemnity   upon the people, and they began to reflect and wished to heare  preaching; we held several meetings and preached to the people, and  baptized Mr. Hubbel and his wife, aged people ^persons^, who had opened their   doors, and given us a home; and just as we had got the people   prepared to receive the Gospel, and anxious to learn and pleading with   us to stay and preach, bro. Brown resolved that he would continue   his journey south.  I was fully satisfied that should we stop, we would  build up a church, and was convinced it was our duty to stop   but bro. Brown held the office of an Elder ^& I submitted^ and I was a Priest, we   were travelling together upon a mission, and I felt that I must be   subject to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.        This is an error which many have committed in this church   who were sent as Missionaries to the world, as soon as they got doors  open and a people prepared to receive the Gospel, they go away and   leave them: we left this people with tears in their eyes. Brother   Brown did not baptize another person ^on the mission^ during his whole southern  mission.    March 2, we cut down a large cotton wood tree, and ^in ◊ two days^ dug out   a canoe 4 feet wide & 12 feet long, put on a pair of oars and ^then^ rowed  down the Arkansas river, 125 miles, to little Rock, begging our food   by the way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity; after visiting   little Rock we travelled down the river 10 miles, and tied up our   canoe on the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones, I preached   next day at his house. On the 16th, we left our canoe with Mr. Jones   and walked back up the river 10 miles, opposite little Rock, and took   the old military road, and started to wade the Mississippi swamp   which was mostly covered with water from little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis,   Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles. We waded through mud and   water knee deep, day after day, and in some instances 40 miles per day,  before we could get a stopping place.     
 August 1832 a continuance of the foreerding subject  I have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstances  of my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of   God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was written  some time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for the  present and continue my narrative begginning where I  left off       When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commenced  the Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrowness  of that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait a  way as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few should  find & walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceive  the many artful & cunning devices of Satan to draw the  child of God from the paths of holiness I had not yet learnt  by experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth about  seeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with his  deadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highway  of Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward and  began to take up my march thither I soon began to hear  the — at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying to  win me back to his service and I soon began to feel his firey  darts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarter  I soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfare  and that I must act not only the offensive but likewise  the defensive part and if I would gain the prize I must  fight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn the  use of the armour with which Christians fight their battles  and from whom I could expect help from trouble      I could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and the  Shield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^& armour^, did not fit  my body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garments  of Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and set  with ease on one who had so long been clothed with shame  and clad with the filthy garments of Unrighteousness  But I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meek  and lowly some simple & humble lessons of Christianity  before I could make much resistance with the enemy  in case of an open attack. Encouraging thought that  the Captain of our Salvation being in all points tempted  as we are is able to succour those that are tempted  and that he will with every temptation provide  a way for our escape     
 except those who have born the Holy priesthood   and been in tribulation for the Gospel sake after   spending the day together with returned to our families at   night. On the day following May 4, we met in conference   in Quincy The prophet Joseph presiding which caused   great joy to all the Saints, much business was done   on the 4, but on Sunday the 5 May Joseph Smith addressed  the assembly followed by Sidney Rigdon & the Twelve   Apostles the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us   and we had a glorious day.    On the following day May 6, I met with the Seventies &   we ordained 60 men into the Quorum of Elders & Seventies  Brother Joseph met with the Twelve, ^Bishops^ and Elders of   Bishp ^Bishop^ Partridges Home, and there was a number with   us who was wounded at Hauns Mill among the number  was, Isaac Laney, who was in company with about   Twenty others at the Mill. A large armed Mob ^fell upon^ and  ^them^ with rifles and other weapons and shot down 17   of the Brethren & wounded others Brother Laney fled from the   scene but the[y] poured a shower of led after him which   peirced his body through and through, He showed eleven  ball holes in his body, there were 27 in his shirt   7 in his pantaloons, and his coat litteraly cut to   peaces one ball entered one arm pit & came out of the 
 me to her Fathers home in Scarboro  Maine. Those who had assembled together  to hear me speak were relatives, Neighbors,  H former friends. After meeting we returned to   Farmington to my Fathers home where I  spent the night with my Father Mother Step  Mother, Sister & wife Elder Hale was also  with us, on the 19 July, Elder Hale left us  to go to his friends in New Rowley Mass  and on the same evening I held a meeting   in the Methodist meeting house in the Town of  Farmington I had a large congregation  of citizens with whom I had been acquainted  from my youth up. My parents wife and sister  attended the meeting. The congregation seemed  satisfied with the doctrin I taught and  they requested me to hold another meeting, but  I felt anxious to continue my journey and on  the 20 July I parted with my father Step Mother 
 On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an attack  of the Rheumatizm and could not travel fast.       My companion, bro. Brown, had got in a hurry, and wished   to hasten to the Mississippi, close up his mission, take boat and  return to his family in Kirtland, and as I could not travel   as fast as he wished, we parted; he left me sitting on a log in   the mud and water; I was lame and unable to walk, without food,   and 12 miles from the nearest house on the road; he went out of   sight in great haste; I then knelt down in the water and prayed   to the Lord to heal me; the spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and   I was healed; the pain left me, I arose and went my way; whenever   I met with one or more families I preached and bore testimony   to them as I went along. ^¶^ I crossed the Mississippi river on the  evening of the 27th, of March.      I ^&^ staid at a public house kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson,   I was suspected of being an imposter. Mr. Jackson believed I was   one of Murrill's clan, who were then murdering and stealing N^n^egros;   and to test me, he gathered together a large house full of the ^most^ wickedest,  and most corrupt Gentlemen ^people^ in the city, and set me to preaching   to them, to see whether I could preach or not.      I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same company   of men and women will ever meet together again for the same   purpose; or to test for they would not like again to have their   sins and abominations revealed to each other, as plainly and pointedly  as I told them that night, through the inspiration of the Holy   Ghost:  they were glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms.       I travelled from Memphis to middle Tennessee.      April 4, I met with Elder Warren Parrish in Benton   Co., Hime and David W. Patten had labored together through the   winter in Tennessee, and baptized 20 persons. Elder Patten had   returned to Kirtland.  I joined Elder Parrish and we labored   together over 3 months, travelling and preaching daily, baptizing such   as would receive our testimony, extending our labors through ^in^ Tennessee & Ken-  tucky.      June 23, we recieved a letter from Oliver Cowdery,  saying,  that they wished ^requesting^ Elder Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for me to     
 one do you ever consider or contemplate any thing  about the number of evil spirits that occupy the  Earth who are at war against God and Christ and  the saints of God and against all good & seek to destroy  all the Children of men in ery age of the world, let us  reason together a moment upon this subject, it may  be impossible for any man without derct revelation   from God to get to know the exact number but we  may approximate to wards it. The Lord has said by revel-  ation that Lucifer an Angel in authority rebelled against  God & drew away one third part of the Hosts of heaven that  were cast down to the Earth & the Heavens wept over him how  many were cast out of heaven down to the Earth We suppose  that the inhabitants of heaven here refered to were the spirits  of our Father in heaven who were to come down to the Earth &  tak[e] tabernacles on the Earth how many were there to come  down & take tabernacles this again may be sufficient to   take yet perhaps we may come near enough for purpose  it has generally been conceded that there is about 1000 000000  one thousand Million on the earth at a time though the late   statisticians make out fourteen hundred Million at the present  time but we will say 1000 000 000 one thousand Milloin 
 & Sister and took stage for Hartford  with my wife and on my arrival at Hartford  not having money to pay the fare of both of us  I paid the fare of my wife to Rowley Mass where  there was a Branch of the Church presided over  by Br Nathaniel Holmes Father of Johnathan  & Milton Holmes and I journeyed on foot  the first day 52 miles the 2nd 48, & the third  day 302 mils and arrived at arrived at Rowley at 2 oclock  making 136 mils in a little over two days &  a half I spent eight days at New Rowley holding  meetings and visiting the Saints including the  Holmes family I left on the first of Aug  and on the 8th in company with my wife &  Elder Hale I visited my wifes Father family  Ezra Carter in Scarboro Maine, it being  the first time I had ever seen any of her  relatives we were very kindly received. My wife  Phebe had been absent from her home about 
 other another entered his back and came out at   the breast a ball passed through each hip each leg   and each arm all this was while he was running for   life and as strange as it may appear, all those wounds   with one broaken rib did not lessen his speed  but he out run his enemies & carried his life   we can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power   and Mercy of God, president Joseph Young was also   among the number He also fled although the balls flew  around him like l◊◊d yet he was not wounded How   marvelous are the ways of the Lord    Before starting upon our missions to England   we were under the necessity of settling our   families, And as a place called Commerce  afterwards called Named Nauvoo was chosen   for our people to settle I left Quincy in   company with El Brother Brigham Young & our  families on the 15 May and arrived in Commerce  on the 18th and after an interview with Joseph   we crossed the river into the old Military Barracks  in Iowa, and there took up our alode abode   for our Families, President Brigham Young and myself 
 remain and take charge of the Southern churches, and the Lord   would bless me in so doing.      June 28, Warren Parrish ordained me to the office  of an Elder, we baptized some 40 persons while laboring together.      July 23, Elder Parrish returned to Kirtland ^left^.  I continued  to traveled alone through the year, and extended my labors both in   Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptized 43 persons during this   season, 31 after bro. Parrish left me.       Nov. 15, while travelling in the night with several  bro. Benj. L. Clapp and others, a tremendous storm of wind   and rain overtook us; we came to a creek which had swollen to   such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without   swimming our horses; and several of the company were faemialies, and   could not consistently cross the stream / we undertook to head the   stream sufficient to ford it, but in the attempt in the midst   of the darkness, and the raging of the wind and rain, we became ^were^  lost in the thick woods,we had neither fire, light nor road, but   were in the dark, mud, ^amidst the^ rain, wind, mud, creeks and ^fallen^ tree tops,  we crossed streams near twenty times, and setting aside our females  and horses we made more the appearance of fishermen than   travellers. I was reminded of Pauls perils by water; but the   Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for   while we were groping in the dark, running the risk of killing   both ourselves and animals by riding off  steep ^precipitous^ bluffs, a bright light   suddenly shone round about us, and revealed unto us our perilous   situation, as we were upon the edge of a deep gulf; the light   continued with us until we found a house and learned the   right road, then the light disappeared, yet ^&^ we were enabled   to reach the house of bro. Henry Thomas at 9 o'clock in the   evening, without all safe, having rode 20 miles, being 5 hours in  the storm, and forded streams twenty or more times, and we felt   to thank the Lord for our preservation.      During the winter and spring, I continued to labor mostly   alone, through Kentucky and Tennessee, and extended my labors  opening new places, preaching daily, baptizing, confirming and organ-     
 It is also said that a generation passes off ery 33 1/3 years  making three generations in a century which would be  three thousand Million in one hundred years 3 times 10 is 30  which would make thirty thousand Million in  1000 years, 3 times 7 is 21, o which would make two hundred   & ten thousand Millions, is, seven thousand years. The argu  argument might be used that when Adam was created  there was but /2/ on two on the earth and after the flood  but eight souls, but the probability is that during the Millenium  the inhabitants will increase very fast as the age of the children  will be as the age of a tree, and the inhabitants of the Earth  will not die off as they do now. But we will suppose that there  was one hundred thousand Milloin fallen spirits cast down from  from heaven to earth, and that there was one thousand Million  of inhabitants upon the Earth to day that would make one ^one^ hundred  evil spirits to each men, woman & child being on the Earth  and the whole mission and labor of these spirits is to lead  all the children of men to do evil & to destruction. Now I want all  ^of^ our boys & girls to reflect upon this, and to see what danger they  are in and the warefare they have to pass through, these hundred evil spirits  ^to each one of^ the children of men ^seak to^ and lead them into ery temptation possible to   use tobaco, smoke drink whisky, get drunk, curse, sware, lie, steal  & comit adultery & Murder & do evry evil thing possible to cut  them off from salvation as far as possible while on the other hand  the spirit of God labors & strive to preserve all the children 
 from there evils, and the Lord has given his angels charge  concering us, and they do all they can for our salvation  but yet we have all have our agency to chuse the good &  refuse the evil, or chuse the evil & refuse the good. The Lord  forces no man to heaven, neither does the Lord tempt any  man to do evil, when a man is tempted to do evil it is  by the power of the Devil, who is an enemy to all rightousness  I feel very annxious to lure our boys & girls our young men and  maidens to seek for that which is good whenever you are tempted  to do evil turn from it never make light of any of the  commandments or ordinances of the Gospel of Christ, and when you  meet with any company who do it shun their society avoid the  use of tobaco & strong drink for they lead to evil, you are  laying a foundation while in the days of your youth for a  character which will decide your destiny through all time  and throughout all eternity either for Good or Evil. The  Lord has told us by revelation "^see D&.C. sec 130^ that whatever knowledge    or principle of intelligens we attain to in this life it will rise  with us in the resurrection, and any person who gains more   knowledge and intelligence in this life through his dilligence & obedience  than another will have so much the advantage in the world to come"  Therefore we should all strive to be diligent in obt[ain]ing intelligence  and bring to pass righteousness upon our agency & not wait to  be commanded in all things and great will be your reward for  so doing 
 about one year I spent 8 days with Father  Carter & Household visiting the relatives & Saints in  Scarboro and one day I went out into the sea with  a B Fabyan & Ezra Carter my Brothers in Law in  a boat to fish with hooks we caught 250 Cod  Haddock & Hake and we saw four whales two  at at a time, the first ^time^ in my life that I had  ever seen that kind of a fish that swallowd  Jonah. On the 18 August 1837, I parted with  my Wife and her Fathers household leaving her  with them, and in company with Johnathan H  Hale started upon my mission to that I had  in view when I left Fo Kirtland to visit  Fox Islands to preach the Gospel to the inhabitants  thereof. We walked 10 miles to portland & took the  steem boat Bangor which took us to Owls Head  where we went on board of a sloop which landed us  on North Fox Islands at 2 oclock on the 20 of Auguts  August This town is called Vinal Haven it  includes both North & South Fox Islands in Lat  44 North Long 69, 10, population 1800 
 izing new branches, & holding conferences. &c.  Feby. 26, 1836, at a conference held at bro. B. L. Clapp's   in Callaway Co., Ky., I ordained A. O. Smoot & Benj. Boydston   E^e^lders and B. L. Clapp & Dan. Thomas priests.      Bros. Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labors of   the ministry. Elder Smoot frequently accompanied me on   my mission. Elder D. W. Patten returned to Tennessee, in april,   and joined us in our labors, accompanied by his wife, it was   a happy meeting, he related to me the blessings he had received   in Kirtland during the endowments; we travelled and labored   together; persecution raged against us; Elder Patten bore a   strong and forcible testimony unt of ^to^ ^of^ the work of God, and when   we were opposed by mobs he would rebuke them in great   plainness; we were threatened, but not injured; the sick   were frequently healed under our administrations.       May 27, Elder Warren Parrish joined us, he came direct  ^arrived^ from Kirtland and joined us in our labors.  We held a conference   on the 28th, at bro. Seth Utleys; 7 branches were represented con-  taining 116 members. Abel Wilson and Jesse Turpin ^were^ ordained priests   and Albert Petty ordained a Teacher. 31st, I was ordained   under the hands of ^by^ David W. Patten a member of the second   quorum of Seventies. We      We continued to extended our laborsed over a circuit of   several hundred miles, bro. Smoot labored continually with us and   bro. Clapp frequently. We travelled two by two, only as ^except when^ we  ^&^ all met together to hold conferences.      June 19, a states warrant was issued against  D. W. Patten, Warren Parrish & Wilford Woodruff, sworn out   by Mathew Williams, a Methodist priest, and served by the   Sheriff, Robert C. Petty.  Elders Patten and Parrish were   taken by an armed mob of about fifty, under ^pretence^ form ^color^ of law  led by the Sheriff, a Colonel, 1st & 2nd major, with other   officers, and a Methodist priest, with a gun on his shoulder   I was in another County and not taken.  We were accused   of prophecying falsely, by saying, that four persons who     
 [page covered] [w]ith our families both went into one room   [page covered] [a]bout 14 feet square. Finally Br Young obtained a   room and moved into it by himself then Orson   Pratt & family moved into the same room with   myself and family, ^A day of Gods Power^ while I was living in these cabins  with in the old barracks we experienced a day of Gods   with the prophet Joseph. It was a very sickly time   and Joseph had given up his Home in Commerce to  the sick and had a tent pitched in his door yard   and was living in that himself, and the large emigration   who had been driven out of Missouri was flocking into  Commerce but had no homes to go into was lying   in the waggons in tents & on the ground and many   were sick though the expenses they were subject to   and Br Joseph had waited on the sick untill   he was worn out and nearly sick himself. But in   the morning of the 22 July 1839 he arose in the  morning reflecting upon the salvation of the Saints   of God in their persecutions & affilictions and he  called upon the Lord in prayer and the power of   God rested upon him mightely and he arose up  ^in the Name of^ as [did] Jesus healed all the sick around him in his day  So Joseph the prophet of God healed all around him upon 
 How to obtains revelations from God  In order to obtain revelation from God and in order  to prove when we do obtain a revelation whether it is from  God or not we must follow the teaching of the revelations of  God unto us. St James sayes "if any man lack wisdom let  him ask of God who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and it   shall be given him". [##James 1:5##] Again ask and you shall receive, ◊◊ask  and it shall be given unto you. It was upon this promise  that Joseph Smith went before the Lord and prayed in the name  of Jesus Christ and asked for knowledge wisdom & understa-  nding in order to know what to do to ^be^ saved and he plead the  promise of St James before the Lord and the Lord opened the   heavens unto him, and the Father & Son was revealed unto him  and the voice of the great Ellohem unto him was this is my   Beloved Son hear ye Him this was the first revelation of God  to him and He did harken to the voice of Jesus Christ all his  life afterwards and received a code of revelations and the word of  the Lord unto him as long as He dwelt in the flesh and left as  strong a testament as ever given to the Human family & sealed that  testament with his own life & blood, and we all have to pursue  the same course in order to obtain revelations from God. But I wish   to impress this truth upon the rising generation and all who read this  testimony that the Lord does not give revelation, or send angels to   men, or work miracles, to accomodate the notions of any man  who is seeking for a sign, when we have the principles of the Gospel  revealed to us through the mouth of the savior or by inspired  prophets or Apostles we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal them

 this occasion he healed all in his house and  door yard Then in company with Sidney Rigdon &  several of the Twelve Heber Kimball & Parley P Pratt who had  just got out of prison accompanied him and he  ^went^ through among the sick lying on the bank of the River  and he commanded in a loud voice in the name  of Jesus Christ to come up and be made whole and  they were all healed and when they had healed all  that were sick on the East side of the river they crossed  the Mississippi river in a ferry boat to the west side  to Montrose where we were. The first home they went  into was President Brigham Youngs who was on his  bed sick at the time BThe prophet went into his  home and healed him and they all come out together  as they were passing by my door Brother Joseph sayes  Brother Woodruff follow me this was the ownly word  spoken by any of the company from the time they left  Brother Brighams House till we crossed the public square  and entered into Brother Fordham House He had  been dying for an hour and we expected each minute  would be his last I felt the power of God that    was overwhelming the prophet of God when we entered  the House Br Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham 
 were baptized should receive the Holy Ghost in 24 hours,   and that Christ should come the second time before this gen-  eration passed away; the whole concern was a mob mock   trial, contrary to law, justice, judgment or truth.      On the 29th, I went to a baptist meeting house on   Thompsons creek, to ^preach^ fulfil an previous appointment; the   house was crowded with people, as I rose to speak in the  pulpit a baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the door   on horseback, & stepped in greatly agitated, and told the Deacon   to forbid my preaching in the house, at the sametime  commenced a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling   several lies, which I corrected before the people, which   increased his rage; as I was forbidden to preach in the   house, and had been invited, and travelled many miles   to fulfil my appointment, ^I told the people^ I would like to preach &   was willing to stand on a wood pile, a fence; a cart,   or any place, they would appoint; a man rose and said   he owned the land in front of the meeting house, and   I might stand & preach on that, and welcome, all the   congregation with the exception of the minister and one Deacon  arose and left the house, walked across the street &   formed seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention   while I preached for an hour and a half on the principles   of the Gospel; when I closed I gave liberty for any   one to speak. Mr. Randolph Alexander rose and   made a few remarks, it being the first time he  ^who^ had ^never^ heard a Mormon Elder speak ^before^, he said, the   people of the present day made him think of a   pen of hogs, the keeper would make a trough, and   pour into it anything, hot   or cold water, dish water or anything else, ^and they would drink it,^, but let a   stranger come along and pour over a ba^s^ket of corn on   the back side of the pen, & the hogs would be frightened   and run and snort all over the pen; he said, it was   so with the people, the priests would feed them with     
 unto us again for while the priesthood is rets restored to  the Earth and the revelations of God revealed to us through the  Mouth of prophets & apostles concerning the fullness of the Gospel, Doctrin  ordinances & principles we should study them and treasure up  knowledge by faith & study out of the best books and the   Holy Ghost will bring to our remembrance those things which  we stand in need of in the self same hour that we are called  to teach the people, but when any Elder priest Elder prophet  apostle or Messenger sent of God to preach the gospel gather  the Saints, work in Temples, or perform any work for the Lord  and that man is faithful and humble before the Lord in his prayers  & duty and there is ay any snare or evil in his path, or the righteous  to be sought out, or danger in the emigration of the Saints  either by the sea or land, or knowledge needed in a Temple then  the Lord will reveal all that is necessary for the protection  & benefit of his prophets, Apostles, Elders & seventy as we can  all Testify in our experience for the last fifty years of our  lives in our labor in the vineyard of the Lord. The teaching  of the prophet Joseph Smith to president John Taylor & the rest  of us was to obtain the Holy Spirit get acquainted with it  watch its operations and listen to the whispering of that  spirit and obey its voice and it soon would become a  principle of revelation unto us. We have found this true in our experience  and in order to prove whether a revelation is from God or not  we follow out the principles revealed to us and we find that what was  manifested to us proved true we know it was from God 
 any kind of doctrine, no matter how false, the   people will swallow it down, but let a stranger come   and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which will save  the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the people   are afraid of him.      Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a book   of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and several others followed   his example.      I.SD July 14, I wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery, and   sent him a list of subscribers, and o for the Messenger and   advocate, and a detail of my mission in the South.       18th, I rode in company with A. O. Smoot to a   ferry on the Tennessee river; there ferryman was absent, we   were offered the use of the boat, & ferried ourselves, but   not being much used to the business, and loosing one oar   in the river, and having to row with one ^a^ broken oar, we   landed a great distance below the usual place with a   high circulation of blood and blistered hands, but our horses  leapt the bank and we went on our way to the Sandy,   which we swam and spent the night at Thomas Frazer's      30th, we rode to ^preached at^ Mr. David Crider's,  and preached  at his house, also on Sunday the 31st, ^where^ we were threatened   with ^by^ a mob; I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs of  the rabble, they did not mob us, but ^who^ went in the night   and poisoned both of our horses, the one which I rode  belonging to bro. Samuel West, which died in 2 days afterwards,  brother Smoot's recovedred, the hogs ^swine^ which ^that^ eat of the horse  flesh also died.      Augt. 11 I met with D. W. Patten and his   wife; he and bro. Parrish had been driven out of Benton into   Henry Co. and Elder Parrish had left for Kirtland       29th. We were visited by Elders T. B. Marsh   and E. H. Groves, from Caldwell Co. Mo. and      Sep. 2, We held a conference at Damon's creek   Callaway Co., Kentucky; several branches were represented, containing     
 for truth is one of his attributes & the Holy Ghost deceiveth  no man and when a man becomes acquainted with the  whisperings of the Holy Ghost to hims which is revelation He should  be very careful to obey it for his life may depend upon it  revelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and for the benefit  of my young friends who may read this work I will give an  account of a few instances of my own experience in listening  to the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me in my missions  In 1848 after my returne to winter Quarters from our pioneer  journey, I was appointed by the priesidency of the Church to take my   family & go to Boston & gather up the remnant of the Latter  Day Saints & lead them to the vallis of the mountains while on  my East I drove my carriage into the yard of one of the Brethren  in Indiana & Br Orson Hyde set his waggon by the side   of mine not more than two feet apart I had Deminicus  Carter of provo my wife & four children were with me myself  wife & one child went to bed in the carriage the rest slept in the   home I had been to bed but a short time untill a voice said to me  get up & move your carriage it was not thunder lightning or an  earthquake but the still small voice of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost  I told my wife I must get up & move my carriage she asked what   for I told I did not know except the spirit told me to do it I got   up & moved my carriage several rods and set it by the side 
 & took him by the right hand Joseph   [page covered] [hol]ding his hat in his left hand Br Joseph saw  that his eyes were glazed He speechless and uncon-  cious He held his hand in his looking him in   the sp face He says Br Fordham Do you not know  me[?] at first he made no reply but we could all  see the effects of the Spirit of God resting upon him  He again said Elijah do you not know me[?] with   a low whisper he said yes, He then said have you  not faith to be healed, His answer a little planer  was I am afraid it is to late if you had come  sooner I think I might have been, He had the appearance  of a man waking out of sleep, it was from the sleep  of Death Joseph then said do you not believe that  Jesus is the Christ, I do Br Joseph. Then the prophet  of God spoke with a loud voice as in the Majesty of  the GodHead Elijah I command you in the Name  of Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. The  words of the prophet was not like word of man but  like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the House shook  from its foundation, Elijah Fordham leaped from   his bed like a man raised from the dead [to] life and 
 The[y] get their living entirely by fishing. There   is a few garden patches under cultivation   but at great expens, some sheep are kept upon   the Island. Many of the inhabitants fish at New-  Foundland, & bring the fish home and cure them   on flakes and prepare them for Market, they   supply the market with great quantities of Cod  Mackerel and Boxed Herren. upon this Island   there are two stores, three tide saw mills, six   school houses, and a small branch of the Methodist  Church & a priest, what timber there is upon this   Island such as pine, fir, spruce, Hemlock, Birch  where the living rasp & goose berries mostly grow out of the   cracks of the rocks, There is great quantities of fish   inhabit the waters coves & harbors around these Islands   such as whales, blackfish, shark, Ground shark, pilot fish,   Horse Mackeral, Sturgeon, psalmon salon,   Holloboat, Cod, pollach, Tom Cod Hake, Haddock   Mackerel, stoat, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen,   Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Skate   shrimp skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, scollop, Dogfish   Muttonfish, Lumpfish, squid Fivefingers M 
 a healthy color came to face, and life was m[an]-  ifest in ery act. His feet were done up in   Indian Mud poltices, He kicked it off his feet and  scattered its contents and he called for clothes put  them on called for a boul of bread & milk & eat  it put on his hat and followed us into the street  to visit others who were sick. The unbeliever may  ask was there not deception in this, if there is any   deception in the mind of the unbeliever There was   none with Elijah Fordham the dying man nor  with those who were present, with him for a few minutes  more he would have been in the spirit world which to day  ^through the blessings of God he lived up to 1880 in which year^  June 24 1880 being 41 years since that event he is alive in the  ^he died in Utah^  Mortal body in Salt Lake City while all who were with   him on that occasion with the exception of two are in the  spirit world, Among the Number were Joseph & Hyrum Smith  Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young Heber C Kimball George A.  Smith and Parly Pratt, Orson Pratt & Wilford Woodruff  are the ownly two living who were present at the time and  we soon shall mingle with those who have gone.   as soon as we left Bro Fordhams we next visited  the House of Joseph B Nobles who lay very low and 
 Monkfish, Nurshfish, sunfish, swordfish  Thrasher, Cat, Scuppog, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner,   Ling, Eels, also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop Mussels   Wincles, and porposes & seal &c &c  Thus I have a brief account of Vinal Haven   It was quite dark when we landed upon the   shore shore at 2 oclock on the morning of the 20 of   August ^without a farthing in money^. We made our way over the rocks & beaches   the best we could untillw untill we found a home   we landed without a farthing in money we rap[p]ed   at the door a woman put her head out of the   window and asked who was there & what we wanted I   told her we were two strangers and wanted a bed   to lie down untill morning, she let us in ang gave  us a bed and we slept untill quite late in   the morning it being sunday when we arose and   took breakfast it was nearly noon I asked   her what she charged us for our entertainment   She said we were welcome, I then asked her if   there was any religion or Minister or Church on the   Island she informed me there was a Baptist Minister  by the name of Newton who had a congregation and 
 of the Home as I was going to bed the same spirit said to me  go & move your Mules away from that oak tree which was  one hundred yards north of our carriage I moved them to a [young]  hickery grove & tied them up & went to bed in thirty minuts  a whirlwind took the tree ^from the shaft near the ground^ to which my mules were fastened  & carried it one hundred yards swept two fences in its course  and laid it prostrate through that yard where my carriage stood  and the top limbs hit my carriage as it was, In the morning I  measured the trunk of the tree where my carriage stood and it measured  two feet & it came within a foot of Br Hyde waggon but  did not touch it, so by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God   to me I saved my life, my wife, and child, & my animals & went  my way rejoicing in the morning,. And in my returne with a  large company of Saints from Boston & the east, in 1850  on my arival in pittsburgh I engaged a passage for myself  & company on a Steemer to St Louis I had no sooner  engaged the passage than the spirit says to me go not on  board of that Steemer neither you nor your Company I obeyed  the revelation to me & did not go on board but took  another Steamer the first Steamer started about dark  with 200 passengers on board when 5 miles down the 
 119 members; Johnson F. Lane, Benj. L. Clapp and Randolph   Alexander were ordained Elders, and Lindsey Bradey to the office  of  a priest by D. W. Patten, who baptized five at the   close of the conference.      ISD At this conference I was released from my labors in   the South, and counselled to go to Kirtland and receive my   endowments, as was also A. O. Smoot      Sep. 19, I parted Elders Marsh and D. W. Patten and wife   and E. H. Groves started for Far West. I organized the   first company of Saints who emigrated from the Southern states,  which numbered 22 souls.      I appointed Elder Boydston Prest. of the Coy. and counselled   them to be united, and to remember their prayers night and   day before the Lord.      20,th, the camp started. I spent a few days visiting   the branches, baptized and confirmed 8, and obtained 30 subscribers for   the Messenger and Advocate.       Oct. 20th, In company with A. O. Smoot & Jesse Turpin   I started for Kirtland; this was the first time I had ever   travelled on a steam boat, we left the steamer at Louisville on   the 28th, and spent 19 days visiting Elder Smoots relations and preach-  ing among the people; we visited the big bone lick;  we arrived in Cincinnatti Nov. 17, where we saw thirteen persons   dead and wounded taken from the Steamer Flora ^which had burst her pipes while running a race^; arrived in   Kirtland on the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meeting   the prophet Joseph, and many Elders, with whom I was acquainted   in the camp of Zion. 29th, I heard Joseph preach in the Temple.   In the afternoon I was called to speak and read the 56 chap. of  Isaiah, and made some remarks upon it, and gave an account   of my mission in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the Saints.      I was counselled by the Presidency to attend the school  in the Temple taught by Prof. Haws, I studdied the Latin language   and English Grammar, and boarded with bro. Ira Bond.       I attended meetnigs with the Seventies and other Quorums   during the winter of 1836–7, and recieved much valuable instruction     
 Ohio river the boat took fire burnt the tiller ropes  so they could not reach shore and the lives of nearly  all were lost either by fire or water while we arrived in safety to  our destination by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God to   us. In another instance after attending a large conference in April  and having a good deal of business to attend to I was somewhat   weary and at the close of the conference I thought I would   repare to my home and have a rest as I went into the yard   the spirit says to me take your team & go to the farm which   is some three miles South of the Tabernacle as I was putting the   horses on the waggon Mrs Woodruff asked where I was going. I said  to the farm "what for, I do not know,["] but when I arrived there   I found out. the creek had overflowed broke through my ditch  ditch surrounded my home, filled my barn yard & pig  pen. my wife waiding in the water trying to turn it from the  lot to save the home & the family but through my own exertion  I soon turned it and saved much damage that might  have accrued if I had not obeyed the voice of the spirit. This   same spirit of revelation has been manifest by many of my brethren  in their labors in the kingdom of God, one of which I will here name  Elder Charles C Rich while going from Sacramento to San-  bernadino with a company of the Brothern. He had in his posession  quite a large amount of money to make payment on their purchase 
 Meeting house about two miles from there so  we thanked her for her kindness and walked to  the Meeting House and steped inside of the door  and stood untill a Deacon came to the door  I asked him to go & tell the Minister in the  pupit that there was two servants of God at  the door who had a message to deliver to that  people & wished the privilege of delivering it. He sent  word to us to come into the pulpit so we walked  through the congregation with our valieces under  our arms, and took a seat each side of the Minister  who was about to speak as we came to the door  He arose and delivered his discours to the people  of about half an hours length, when he closed  he asked me what was my wish I told him we   wished to speak to the people any hour that would  suit his convenience and the people so he gave  out word that there were two strangers present  who would speak to the people at 5 oclock. We were  quite a wonderment to the people not knowing  who we were Mr Newton invited us home to  tea which we gladly exepted when we arrived at  his home I opened my valiece and took out 
 dangerously sick when we entered the home Brother  Joseph took him by the hand and commanded him  in the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made whole  and he arose & was immediately healed, and while this  was going on the wicked mob in the place led by one  R Mourn had became alarmed and followed us into  Br Nobles Home But before them arrived in the  Home Br Joseph had called upon Br Fordham to  offer prayer and while he was praying the mob entered  with all the evil spirits that accompanied them  as soon as they entered Br Fordham who was  praying fainted & sank to the floor as soon as  Joseph saw the mob in the home he a◊◊◊ and bid  the room cleared of both that class of Men and  ^Devils^ immediately Br Fordham came to and finished  his prayer, it shows what power evil spirits  have upon the tabernacles of men and the saints  are ownly saved from the power of the devil by the  power of God. This case of Br Nobles was the last  case of healing of the day. It was the Greatest Day of  the power of God and of healing members on the Earth  since the organization of the Church and Kingdom 
 the Bible Book of Mormon & Doctrin & Covents  and laid them on top of each other and took my seat  Mr Newton took up the Books and looked  at them but said Nothing I then asked him  if there were any school houses on the Island he  said there was four school houses I asked him  if they were free to preach in he said yes they were  Numbered from one to four at the time appointed  Mr Douglass & family accompanied us to the  Meeting House where we met a large congregation  none of whom knew who we were or our profession  except Mr Douglass Elder Hale and myself went into  the Stand and I arose amid peculiar feelings and  addressed the congregation for one hour from Gal 1,  Ch  8 & 9 verses. This was the first time that I or [any]  Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  (to my knowledge) had attempted to preach the Gospel  to the inhabitants of any Island of the Sea fulness  of the Gospel, & the Book of Mormon to the inhabitants  of any Island of the Sea I had much liberty in   speaking and informed the people that the Lord had raised  up a prophet and organized his Church as in the days 
 this was known to some rode agents in the city and they gathered  a company of robers and went on ahead of Brother Rich and lay  in ambush intending to kill the mormans & rob them of their  money before reaching the company of robers they came to a big path  ahead which shortened their distance the spirit said to Brother  Rich to take that path the Brothren with him marveled at  his course not knowing that enemies awaited them,   but they arrived in safety at Sanbernadeno with their  lives & money, while the robbers marvelled why their  prey did not come,,I will now give one example in my  own experience of the result of not obeying the voice of the spirit  some years since I had a part of my family living in Randolph  Rich County I was there on a visit with my team in the  Month of Dec one monday Morning my monitor the spirit  watching over me said to my me take your team & go home  to Salt Lake when I named it to my family who were  there they urged me very hard to stop longer through their   persuasion I staid untill Saturday morning with the spirit  pressing me very hard to go home I began to feel alarmed to   think that I had not obeyed the whisperings of the spirit to  me before I took my team & started early Saturday morning  when I arrived at Woodruff the Bishop urged me to  stop untill monday & he would go with me I told him 
 Dec. 20, 1836, I was present at the organization of the  third Quorum of seventies; there was^ere^ 27 ordained.      Jan. 3, 1837, I was set apart to be a member of  the first quorum of Seventies.      6th, I visited the office of the Kirtland safety  society, and saw the first paper that was issued from that institution,  it was given to Jacob Bump in exchange for other notes, he was  the first to circulate it.      I heard Pres. Joseph Smith declare in the presence of  F. G. Williams, D. Whitmer, E. Smith, W. Parrish and others, that  he had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject  of the Kirtland safety society, he was alone in a room by himself,  he ^&^ not only had the voice of the spirit, but ^heard^ an audible voice upon  the subject; and said if the people would give heed to his counsel  all would be well.      25th, at early candle light, ^a^ clouds began to arise in  the North East and reached to the north west, having the ap-  pearance of fire, and it soon spread over the whole horizon, the  reflection of the clouds upon the earth which was covered with snow  had a blood red appearance; it commenced at about 6 o'clock and   lasted till past 10 p.m.      29th, Prests. Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery addressed the  saints in the Temple, Joseph blessed the people in the name  of the Lord, and said, if we would be faithful, we should arise  above our embarrassments and be delivered from the hands of our  enemies.      30, I wrote an article ^on Faith^ which was published in  the Messenger and advocate.      Feb. 19, I attended meeting at the Temple.  Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on business for the church,  but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from  Israel, yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they did not  make a calf to worship as did the Israelites, they turned    their hearts away from the Lord and from His servant Joseph,  and had engaged in speculation and given away to false spirits     
 when we left Br Nobles, the prophet Joseph went  onto the bank of the river waiting for the Ferry boat  to return back home with those who accompanied  him. We accompanied him to the river  while waiting for the boat a man came to Joseph  Smith of the world, knowing of the miricles which had  been performed he having a pairs of twin children  about 5 months old old and both laying [each]  night unto death aske[d] the prophet of he would  not go and heal them but they were some 2 miles  from Montrose the prophet said he could not go  but after pausing some time he said he would  send some one to heal them and he turned to me  and said you go with the man & heal his children  and he took a bandanna red silk hankerchief  out of his pocket and gave to me and told me to  wipe their faces with the hankerchef when I administered  to them and they should be healed and he said unto me  as long as you will keep that hankerchief it shall  remain a league between us you and me I went  with the man and done as the prophet commanded  me & the children were healed and I keep possession  of the hankerchief unto this day. 
 of Christ and the ^ancient^ Apostles, with prophets & Apostles  and the gifts of the Church, as anciently and that   the Lord had brought forth the Book of   Mormon. At the close of my remarks Elder Hale   bore testimony, I gave liberty for any one to speak   that wished no one spoke at the close I gave   notice that we should hold meeting during the   next four evenings in the school house beginning   with No. 1. The first 13 days of our abode on the Island   we preached 17 discourses being invited by the   Inhabitants to tarry with them I left a copy  of the Doctrins & Covents with Mr Newton to   read which he did do and the spirit of God bore testimony  testimony to him of its truths and he walked   his room till midnight trying to decide what   to do whether to receive or reject it and he with   his family attended about a dozen of my first meet-  ings then made up his mind contrary to the   dictation of the spirit of God to him, to reject it   and came out against me. But we commenced baptizing 
 Chapter 3rd preparing for our journey & Mission  The blessings of the prophet Joseph upp upon our  heads and his promises upon us. The power of the  Devil manifest to hinder our performing our Mission    (on the 1st day of July Joseph Smith & his counsellors Sidy  Rigdon & Hyrum Smith crossed the river to Montrose to spend  the day with the Twelve and set them apart & bless them  before they started upon their missions there were twelve  in number & dined at my House. After dinner we  assembled at Brigham Youngs Home for our Meeting  Br Hyrum Smith opened by prayer After which the presidency  laid their hands upon our heads & gave us a  blessing president Rigdon was mouth in blessing me they also  blessed Sisters Young, Tayler & Woodruff the prophet Joseph  promised us if we would be faithful we should again  return to our families & friends and be blessed upon  our missions and have many souls as seals of our  ministry and returne again in peace and safety to  our families & friends (all of which was fulfilled) Br Hyrum  ordained us to preach the first principles of the Gospel  and thought that was about as much as this genera-  tion could endure. Then Joseph arose and preached some  precious things of the Kingdom of God unto us in the power of the  Holy Ghost some of which I will mention from my journal  Ever keep in exercise the principal of mercy and be ready 
 until they were darkened in their minds and many were   opposed to Joseph Smith, and some wished to appoint David Whitmer  to lead the church in his stead; in the midst of this cloud   of dark spirits, Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this morning  arose in the stand, when he appeared as though he was  much depressed, but soon the spirit of God rested upon hism  men and he addressed the assembly in great plainness for  about 3 hours, and put his enemies to silence. when he arose  he said, "I am still the President,— prophet, seer, Revelator  and leader of the church of Jesus Christ, and kingdom God  and not not man has appointed and placed me in this   position, and no man or set of men have power to remove  me or appoint another in my stead, and those who undertake  this, if they do not speedily repent, they will ^burn their fingers &^ go to hell.  He reproved the people sharply for their sins, darkness and  unbelief, the power of God rested upon him, and bore testimony  that his sayings were true.      Mar. 23rd was spent in the Temple by the  saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer. The Patriarch Joseph  Smith Sen. presided; the spirit of the Lord was poured out  upon the people, a contribution was taken up for the poor.      April 4, I received my washings and anointings in the   house of the Lord, I spent the whole night in the Temple   with others of the Seventies in prayer and fasting, the spirit  of the Lord rested upon us, after 24 hours I partook of food.      6th, The Presidency of the church, the Twelve  apostles and other Quorums met in solemn assembly, and sealed  upon our heads, our washings, anointings and blessings with a  loud shout of Hossanna to God and the Lamb; the spirit  of the Lord met ^rested^ upon us, after spending three hours in   the upper room, the quorums repaired to the lower court, &  the vails were lowered, the ordinance of washing of feet was  administered, Elder H. C. Kimball washed my feet &  pronounced blessings upon me; after this ordinance the vails of  the Temple were rolled up, and Prest. Joseph Smith addressed     
 his flock. The first two we baptized was a  sea Captain & his wife by the name of Justis Eames  Brother Johnathan H Hale went down into the sea  and baptized them on Sunday the 3rd of Sept the  first ever baptized upon any Island of the Sea in  this dispensation to my knowledge, and on the next  sabbath I baptized his Brother Ebenezar Eames another  Sea Captain and a young Lady. Mr Newton the   Baptist Minister now commenced a war agaist us  against us and sent to the South Island for   a Mr Douglass a Methodist Minister to  (with whom he had been at variance for  years) to come over and help him put down  mormonism. He came over and held a conf-  -erence and got all the people together they could   and he railed against Joseph the prophet and the Book   of Mormon and he took the Book in his hand  and with an out stretched [hand] declaired he knew none  of the Judgments of God that would come upon him  for rejected that Book as the word of God 
 and will lead the Elders to them. A remarkable instance of this was   manifest in my own experience in 1840 while laboring in Stafford-  shire was preaching & baptizing daily and one night I went into the   City Hall of the Town of Hanley and as I was about to arise to speak   to a large assembly the voice of the spirit of God to me was this is the last   meeting you will hold with this people for many days I was asstonished   at this as I had a weeks appointments out before me I told the people   it would be the last meeting I would hold with them for many days   they were as much asstonished as I was at the close of the meeting several   came forward for baptisim and many asked where I was going I told   them I did not know, I went before the Lord and asked where I   should go the voice of the Lord said go to the south I got into a   stage & rode 80 miles south into Herefordshire and the first mans  home I stayed was John Benbows who received me kindly & I conversed   with him & his wife untill 2 oclock in the morning & I readily found   out why the Lord had sent me there their was a company of 600 to   which Br Benbow belonged called united Brethren who were desiring  for light and truth had got as far as they could and were praying for the Lord   to open their way and the Lord had sent me to them and the result  was that in the first 30 days after my arrival in their midst I baptized   some 45 preacher of the united Brethren including Thomas Kington then presidind   Elder & placed in my hands all their Chapels & homes licensed for   preaching I baptized the whole of the 600 except one man and during eight   months labor there I brought into the Church some 1800 Saints including   near 100 preachers of the various denominations. Now I knew nothing   about this people or their preperation for the Gospel untill the Lord   sent me to them by revelation 
 the Elders for three hours, clothed with the spirit and power   of God, he unbosomed his feelings in the house of his friends,—   gave much instruction, he urged upon us the absolute necessity of   giving strict heed to his teachings and counsel, and the Revelations   of the Lord to the church, and be wise in all things, that  Zion and her stakes may be redeemed and established, no more   to be thrown down, he said, that the kings of the earth   would yet become to behold the glory of Zion, and that   great and glorious blessings would be bestowed upon the Saints   in the last days. Hyrum Smith bore testimony, and was followed   by Oliver Cowdery, who exhorted the Elders to keep within the   bounds of their knowledge, and let the great mysteries of the  kingdom alone, for the Gentiles had not a knowledge even   of the first principles of the Gospel, ^he said^ it It is far better to   preach what the people would call the small things of the   kingdom, than to enter with the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel   and John. The twelve broke bread which was distributed   to the multitude, who eat and were filled, thanks wereas returned   and the meeting closed at the setting of the sun. ¶ The house   was again filled at candle light, Prest. Smith requested the Elders   to speak their feelings freely, and sing, exhort and pray, as the   spirit should give utterance, the meeting continued during the   whole night, many of the gifts were poured out upon the   people; at break of day we were dismissed.       I also spent the night of the 7th, in the Temple,   with several of the Elders in prayer and praise before the Lord,  the Holy Ghost rested upon us and the spirit of prophecy was   given to us, and many things were shown us, by the holy  spirit. April      April 9, Prest. Smith spoke in the afternoon, and   said in the name of the Lord that His ^the^ judgments ^of God^ would   rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends   and friends of humanity, and in building up Kirtland, a   stake of Zion; but had turned traitors to him, and the   interests of the kingdom of God, and had given power     
 to forgive our Brother on ther first intimation of repentance   and asking forgiveness for our Heavently Father will be equilly  as merciful unto us also we ought to be willing to repent  of ^and confess^ all of our own sins and keep Nothing back and Let  the Twelve be humble and not be exhalted, and beware  of pride and not seek to excell one above another but act  for each others good and honirably make mention of each  others names ^in prayer^ before the Lord and before our fellow men  do not back bite or devour our brother. The Elders of Israel  should seek to learn by precept & example in this late age  of the world and be oblieged to learn ery thing we know  by sad experience I trust the remainder of the Twelve will  learn wisdom & not follow the example of those who have  fallen. When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christ  stands before the congregations of the earth and they preach  in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the  people are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin and  say that that man has preached a powerful discourse,  a great sermon then let that man or those men take  ease that they do not ascribe the Glory unto themselves but  be careful that they are humble and ascribe the praise &  Glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of the  Holy Ghost priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have power  thus to speak, who art thou O man but dust, and  from whom dost thou receive thy power and blessings but  from God Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel  observe this [FIGURE] key and be wise, ye are not sent out to be  taught but to teach. Let every man be sober be be  vigilent and let all his words be received with Grace 
 I will refer to one more instance in my experience upon the subject of revelation  all the Latter Day Saints understand that we build Temples for the   purpose of administering ordinances for our dead as well as for the   living, and the Lord has opened the way in a remarkable manner  for many of the members of the Church to obtain records of the   names of their dead for several generation I had also obtained   a record of some over 3000 of my Father & Mother family, after the   Dedication of the Temple in St George president Young appointed me   to preside over it, and when we commenced with in the Temple I  begun to reflect how can I redeem my dead, I have some 3000 name  who are dead, that have been baptized for and how can I get endowments   for them I had none of my family there, and if I had they would not   be able to get endowments for so many. And while praying to the Lord to   show me how I could redeem my dead the Spirit of God rested upon   me and the voice of the spirit of God said to me go to and call upon   the Son & Daughter of Zion in St George, to come into the temple   of the Lord and get their Endowments for your dead and it shall be   acceptable unto me saith the Lord, this fulled my soul with joy   and turned a key that opened a field as wide as eternity for the salvation   of our dead, and the redemption of man that we might magnify  our calling as Saviors upon Mount Zion. And one my birth day   March 1, 1877, the day that I was 70 years, 154 sisters of St George   went into the Temple & got Endowments for so many of the female portion of   my dead and this principle was received by president Young and   adopted from this houn and through the assistans of friends I have   had nearly 2000 of my dead received Endowments in the Temple of the Lord 
 but (I never learned what his sentiments were   upon this subject at the end of his tearm of  fourteen years ^imprisonment^ in the Thomastons penetentiary  for a rape upon his daughter the judgment of  which was given upon the testimony of both wife  and daughter) I was present at & heard Mr  Douglass in his discours upon the occasion  and took minutes of the same when he closed  I came and informed the people I would meet  with them next Sunday in the meeting house &  answer Mr Douglass and wished him as well  as the people to be present I informed the people  that Mr Douglass had made many fals statements  against Joseph Smith and the mormons a people with  whom he had No aquaintance and he had  misquoted much scripture all of which I wished  to correct. We continued to baptize the people  on the North Island untill we had baptized every  person who owe dollars in the Baptist Meeting  House I then followed Mr Douglass home 
 and keep in mind that it is a day of warning and  not of many words. Act honest before God & men beware  of sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in whom  you have no confidence be ^honest^ open and frank [illegible] in all  your intercourse with mankind I wish to say to  the Twelve and all the Saints to profit by this important key  that in all your trials, troubles, and temptations afflictions  bonds, imprisionsments and death se[e] to it that you do  not betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your  Brethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God whether  in the bible Book of Mormon or Doctrin & Covenants or  any of the word of God Yea in all your troubles see that  ye do not this thing lest innocent blood be found in  your shirts and ye go down to Hell. We may ever know  by this sign that there is danger of our being lead to  a fall & aposticy when we give way to the devil so as to  neglect the first known duty but whatever you do do  not betray your friend the forg[o]ing are some of the important  instructions given to the Twelve by the prophet Joseph  before they started upon their missions  In as much as the devil had been in a means not [prevented]  by the Twelve going to Far west & returning without la◊◊n it  seemed as though the Destroyer was determined to make  some other affect upon us to hinder our performing our  mission for it seemed that as soon as any one of the  A Apostles begins to prepare for starting they were smitten 
 into the hands of our enemies against us; ^t^They had   oppressed the poor saints ^& had brought sought to bring distress th upon them^, and had become covenant breakers,  for which they ^will feel the^ wrath of God,^.^ he said, they would become   whited walls.      April 13 1837, I married Phebe W. Carter daughter   of Ezra and Sarah Carter of Scarborough, Maine, the ceremony   was performed, at the house of Prest. Joseph Smith, by Fred.   G. Williams Esq. the prophet Joseph was expecting ^had appointed^ to marry us,   but his life was sought by a mob and he had to flee.       15, I received my Patriarchal blessings under the hands   of the Patriarch Joseph Smith Sen. My wife having received her   Patriarchal blessings from him previously.      May 5[th], while laboring for Joseph Young, we ^Kirtland^ wereas  visited with a sudden storm of wind and rain, a vain ^current^ of it passed  south of the Temple in the form of a whirlwind or tornado, which   destroyed and injured several buildings, it clo cros crushed ^one of^ Joseph Young's  buildings and removed the one we were in some 10 feet, but no   person was injured. ¶ I felt impressed to go out upon a mission,   the spirit was upon me & lead me to go to Fox islands called   Vinal Haven, bordering East upon the ^east coast of the^ state of Maine, it was a   country I had never visited, I named my feelings upon the subject   to Elders Kimball, Rigdon and others, they encouraged me to go.   Elder Kimball blessed me and said in the name of the Lord I   should be blessed and prospered on my mission and do a good work;   I made a proposed to Jonathan H. Hale to accompany me on  my mission, which he did.      May—31, I left my wife and friends in Kirtland, and   walked to Fairport in company with bro. Hale, we were joined by   Milton Holmes, & took the steamer Sandusky and arrived in Buffalo   June 1st, and Syracuse on the 4th, — walked 36 miles to Richland,   Oswego Co. N.Y. and called upon my two brothers Azmon &   Thompson, whom I had not seen for several years; we   visited the churches as far as Sacketts' harbor—called upon   Archd. Patten and delivered to him some letters from Warren   Parrish, ^in^ which were enclosed many ^one^ hundred ^dollar^ bills, which he had     
 and thousands of others have received the same blessings in the same way  President Young received revelation in that Temple & there are yet  many revelations to be received in the last days concerning the redemption  of the dead many other subjects but they will all be manifest in  due time through the proper to authority unto the Church & kingdom  of God. There are many other manifestations of the power of God and  the revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives but I have said  suffient upon this branch of the subject.      we have been called by revelation to give indowments to  many of the dead honorable men of the Earth & our own Nation  who were not members of our family, but I had said suffi-  cient upon this track of the subject      Patricharchial Blessings & their fulfillment      The office of the patriach is to bestow blessings upon their posterity  and the children of men. In section ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56|D. C. 107## The Lord says that  three years previous to the death of Adam he called Seth, Enis,  Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, & Methuselah  who were all High priest with the resedue of his posterity who were righteous  into the Valley of  Adam-ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them   his last blessing,, And Adam predicted whatsover should befal  his posterity unto the latest generation these things were all written in   the Book of Enoch and are to be testified of in due time Abram  Isaac & Jacob were patriarchs and blessed their posterity and all  that Jacob said & sealed upon the head of his Twelve sons have all  been fulfilled to the very letter as far as time would admit off  of we have partiarchs the same in our day Father Joseph Smith     
 with chills and fever or sickness of some kind nearly  all the Quorum of the Twelve began to be sick and their   families so it still required a good deal of faith   and perserverance to be exercised in order to start off   on a Mission with the chills & fever. On the 25 July   for the first time in my life I was attacked with the   chills & fever this I had every other day which laid   me prostrate each day my chill was upon me My   wife Phebe was also soon taken down with chills &   fever as were quite a Number of the Twelve I spent 18  ^days^ in Montrose with my family after I was taken sick   before I started upon my missions. The 17 day of August   was the last day I spent at home in Montrose and although   sick with the chills & fever most of the day I made   what preparations I could to start on my ^the^ mission on the  morrow a mission of four thousand miles to preach   the Gospel to the Nations of the Earth and that to without money   purse or scrip with the power of disease resting upon   with a shak[e] of the fever & ague each alternate day but   but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in   him for the recompense of [renewal]. May the Lord give   me grace according to my day and ◊c◊◊s for my [ink blot] [fire] &   a safe return to my family & friends while f◊◊ter [ink blot] ask  in the name of Jesus Christ Amen 
 To the South Island and preached the  Gospel to and baptized nearly all the members  of his Church. The excitement became great  upon both Islands, and on Sunday the  17 of Sept, I met a large assembly from both  Islands in the Baptist Meeting house and  took up the same subject that Mr Douglass  had dwelt upon against the Book of mormon  and our principles I spoke 2 1/2 hours and  answered ery every objection against the Book of  Mormon or Joseph Smith or our principles  I had good attention and the people seemed satisfied  at the close of the meeting Elder Hale administered  the ordinance of baptism, Mr Newton in  order to try to save his cause went to the  main land and brought over several ministers  with him and held a protracted meeting to try  to stop the work of God among the people, but it  was of no avail for the whole people would  attend our meeting and receive the word of God  and we continued to baptize. We visited the dwelling 
 taken from the Kirtland bank, – having been a Clerk in   that institution., He      We crossed the lake Ontario, visited upper Canada,  and attended a conference, May 10th, with Elders John E. Page   and James Blakesly, in the township of Bastard, Leeds Co.,  there was eight branches represented containing 300 members,  13 elders, 5 priests, 8 teachers and 6 deacons. Elder Wm.   Draper and myself ordained 7 Elders, 9 Priests, 11 teachers   and 5 deacons: 5 were baptized by Elder Page at the   close of the Conference.      A woman was possessed of the Devil and greatly   afflicted, much of the time was dumb, 4 of us laid hands   upon her, and cast the Devil out of her in the name  of Jesus Christ, and she was made whole and gave thanks   unto God, and went on her way rejoicing. ¶ We visited several   other branches and preached the word of God and several   of the sick were healed. ¶ We returned to Kingston.—  took steamer for Oswego and canal for Albany; we   ^bros.^ John Goodson, Isaac Russell & John Snider accompanied   us from Canada, and left us at Schenectady, to join Elders   Kimball, Hyde and Richards at New York, to go to   England.      We walked from Albany to Farmington. Conn. — attended   a conference of the saints in Canaan — arrived at my fathers   house July 6th, this was the first time I had ever seen my   Father or relatives in Conn. since I joined the church; they   received me kindly. On the 10th, I preached in the city hall   in Colinsville, and a mob gathered and attempted to break up   the meeting, with fife and drum, hollowing and yelling; they   were stirred urged on by a presbyterian priest; at the close  of the meeting the priest came to me with his rabble   and asked many questions; he said, I had no right   to my opinion, and no man had a right to preach the   Gospel unless he had a collegiate education, I told him I   would admit that point when he could tell me ^at^ what     
 [page folded] of most of the inhabitants of the Islands  while standing upon Mr Carvers farm on the East   end of the north Island we counted 55 Islands some  were inhabited but the majority of them were not, we also  saw twenty ships under sail at the same time   we had no lack for food while upon these Islands  for if we did not wish to trouble any of our friends   for a dinner we would borrow a spead or hoe & bucket  & go onto the beach & dig a peck of clams & boil   them and they would make us a delicious meal   which we often practiced, On the 5 Sept, Elder   Hale & myself went onto the top of a high granite   rock upon the South Island, for prayer and supplication  we sat down upon under a pine growing out of   a fissure of the rock and Brother Hale read the   ##Jeremiah 16:16|XVI Chapter## of Jeremiah speaking of the hunters and  fishers that God would chuse up in the last days to   gather Israel and of a truth here we were on  an Island of the sea standing upon a rock where   we could sirvey the gallant ships and also the  Islands which were as full of rock holes & coves as any  part of the Earth. But what had brought us here  to search out the blood of Ephraim the honest and  meek of the Earth, and gather them from there 
 The Father of the prophet Joseph was the first patriarch in  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He gave  a great many blessings unto the Latter Day Saints which are  recorded, and many of them have received their fulfillment, when he  puts hands upon the head of a person to bless them it seemed as  though the heavens were opened unto him, and he could reveal the  whole life of the person. He gave me my patriarchal blessing in the   Temple of the Lord in Kirtland on the 15 day of April 1837. Many mar-  velous things which he sealed upon my head in which I could see  no earthly chance for their fulfillment has already been fulfilled  to the very letter one or two instances I will name. He said I  should have access to the treasures hid in the sand to assist me in my  necessities in gathering myself and others to Zion. While in Cambridgeport  gathering up the Sants in 1850, Allexander Boblam went to Cal-  afornia on business and the Saints there who were diging gold filled  a little buck skin sack with gold dust and sent to me to assist  me on my mission by the sale of this treasure from the sands of California  I was enabled to gather myself family & a number of others to Zion  in the Mountains of Israel. He also said I should have power to  bring my Father & his houshold in to the Chur Church of Christ while on  my misson to Fox Islands I visited my Father in Farmington Conn ^Ct^  and preached the gospel to him and baptized him & all his  houshold including my Step Mother & ownly Sister M and  a Methodist Class leader who was boarding at my fathers 
 Chapter 4.   Leaving my family, starting upon my missions  and Incidents upon the Journey    Aug 8, 1839 Early on this important morning I arose   from my sick bed, laid my hands upon the head   of my wife Phebe and blessed her and departed from   her ^the^ embrace of my companion and left her   almost without food or raiment the necessaries of life   she parted with me with this fortitude that becomes   a Saint realizing the responsibility of her compan-  ion. Phebe farewell, be of good chear, remember  me in your prayers, I leave these pages for your   perusal when I am gone, I shall see thy face again in   the flesh I go to obey the command of Jesus Christ.   Although feeble I walked to the Bank of the Mississippi  River there President Brigham Young took me in a  canoe (having no other [company]) & paddled me across the   river I lay down on a side of sole leather by  the post office to rest some Br Joseph the prophet   of God came along & looked at me Well Br Woodruff   says he you have started on your Mission yes says   I but I feel & look more like a subject for the 
 , which followed him to England and the  ^HCK & Oxford^  Twelve while administering to ^him^ at prestin England, had  a severe contest with them as Heber C Kimball  has related in his History    When eleven years of age I had I dreamed  that I saw the had a dream which made a   great impression upon my mind. In this dream   the final judgment was portrayed to me, and I   saw hosts of persons depositing their riches 
 desecting room than a missionary Joseph replyied   what did you say that for get up & go along all   will be right with you. I name these incidents that   the recorder may know how the Quorum of the Twelve   Apostles started on their missions to England in 1839   Elder John Taylor was agoing with me and we were   the two first ^two^ of the Quorum that started on the mission   and Br Taylor was about the ownly well man there   was in the Quorum the rest being sick soon a brother   came along with a waggon and took us in as we   were passing through the place we came to Parley P Pratt   who was strip[p]ed to his shirt and pants bare headed  & Barfoot hewing a log preparing to build him a   cabbin cabin he says Br Woodruff I have got   no money but I have got an empty purse which   I will give you which he brought to me which   I thanked him for went a few roads further &   met Br Heber C Kimball in the same condition as  Parley hewing a log to build a cabins. He says as  Parley has given you a purse I have got a doller   I will give you to put in it, he gave me both  a doller & a blessing we drove 16 miles across a prarie 
 college Jesus Christ and his Apostles obtained their education   in, : the priest and rabble then left me.      12th, I preached in a school house in West Avon   to an attentive congregation; after meeting I baptized my Uncle   Ozem Woodruff, his wife and son, John, in fulfillment of a   dream which I had when I w at 10 years of age.      I visited most of my relatives in Conn., and preached   the Gospel unto them.      M 16th, I preached at Adna Harts in Avon  where I was met by my step-mother and sister, ^also by my wife^ who had travelled   alone from Kirtland ^& was on her way^ to visit her father in Maine. but   met with me at this point.      —19th, I parted wi Elder Hale went to   New Rowley, ^Mass.,^ to visit his friends. I had been solicited to   preach to the citizens of Farmington by many prominent   men, but every room which was offered me, including the   town hall was closed against me by the Rev. Noah Porter,   Pastor of the Presbyterian church, until the Methodist church   was offered me, which he had not room ^influence^ to close, 2 hours  after I gave out the appointment the house was filled,  and I preached to a very attentive congregation, including my   Father and his household, for an hour and a half upon the first   principles of the Gospel; I gave liberty to the assembly to ask any   questions, or find any fault with what I had said, but I met with   no opposition.      —20th, I left my Father's house and in company with my   wife, took stage and rode ^by stage^ to Hartford.       —21st, Not having money to pay the fare for ^us^ both myself   and wife, I paid her fare in the stage to New Rowley, Mass., and I  walked through a hot sultry day 15 hours, averaging three and a half   miles per hour, making 52 miles.       22nd. I walked 48 miles.      23rd, I walked 36 miles and arrived at Elder Nathaniel   Holmes', in R New Rowley, at 2 o'clock p.m., making 136 miles on   foot ^in^ a little over two days and a half, I met with my wife     
 My Father was gathered to Salt Lake City with the Saints where he died  aged 83 years. He said I should be wrapt in the arms of heaven and  an angel of God should teach me many things this was fulfilled in the  house of Abram O Smote in Kentucky in the spring of 1835. The patriarch  also told me that I should be delivered from my enemies (who  would seek my destruction) by the mighty power of God & the adm-  inistrations of Angels. This was marvelously fulfilled while in  the City of London in 1840 Heber C Kimball George A Smith  & myself went to London together in the winter of 1840 the first Elders  who had attempted to establish the Gospel in this great & mighty  as soon as we commenced, the power of the Devil was manifest  the evil spirits gathered to gether for our destruction and at times  they have great power, and would destroy all the Saints of God if  they were not restrained by the power of God Br Smith and myself  were alone together and had retired to our rest each occupying a cot  by ourselves within 3 feet of each other we had only just laid down  untill there seemed to be a legion of Devils made war upon us  to destroy our lives and we were strugling for our lives in the  midst of this warfare of evil spirits untill we were nearly [crushed]  to death and I began to pray the best I could in the midst of the  struggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to spare our  lives and while three personages entered the room clothed in white  and surrounded with light walked to our bedside laid hands upon  our heads and we were instantly delivered and from this time had 
 and spent the night with with a Brother Merrills   the day following a Brother Perkins ^we rode 10 miles to Br Perkins and he^ took us in his  waggon and carried us to McComb from thence to   Brother Carloss Smith I rode for hours during the day   over a very rough road of stones and stumps lying    on my back in the bottom of the waggon shaking with   the ague and I suffered much. We held a meeting in   a grove near Carloss Smith and here Elder Taylor baptized   George Miller who afterwards was ordained a Bishop, at   the meeting the Saints gave us $9 & George Miller a horse   to help us on our journey, I rode to Rochester with   Father Coultrin where I had an interview with several   families of the Fox Island Saints which I had brought   up with me from Fox Islands in 1838 I spent several   days with them and at Springfield where Elder   Taylor published fifteen hundred copies in pamphlet   form of a brief schedule of the persecutions ^and suffering^ of the Latter  Day Saints by the inhabitants of the State of Missouri.   We sold our horse and in company with Coultrin Father  Coltrin Br Taylor & myself left Springfield & continued   our journey  I having the chills & fever nearly every other   day which made it very distressing for me to ride in a   lumber waggon shaking with the ague on the 24 Aug we   [rode to] Terre haute and spent the night with Dr Modesett 
 no more troubled with evil spirits while in the City of London  as soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from the room  and the light withdrew with them & darkness returned, and my other  of the saying of the patriarch Joseph Smith in my blessing have  been fulfilled in my experience, but I have said sufficient upon  the subject all the blessings that are sealed upon our heads  will be fulfilled & many more if we are faithful & live for them  In closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not think  that the Lord ever sends an Angel to the Earth to visit the  children of men unless it is necessary to deliver a dispensation  of the Gospel or to declare a message or perform ^a work^ that cannot be  done otherwise. It required an Angel of God to deliver  the gospel to Joseph Smith because it was not on the   Earth, and this was in fulfillment of the word of the   Lord through John the Revelator ##Revelation 14:6|Rev 14 Ch 6 vers## and so  in regard to the administration of Angels in all ages of  the wor[l]d it is to deliver a message and perform a work  work which cannot otherwise be accomplished 
 and Elder Milton Holmes, at his Fathers house; I spent several   days in preaching to the Saints in that region.      Aug. 1, We left New Rowley, and was joined by Elder   Hale, who accompanied us to Saco, Maine.      7th, I accompanied my wife to her Fathers house in  Scarborough, ^Maine^ we were kindly received and entertained ^received^; it was the first   time I had seen any of her relations. We found Mother Carter   very sick. I spent several days visiting the Saints in that region.       On the 10th, I accompanied Ezra and Ilus Fabien Carter,  my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excursion; we caught with hooks   250 cod fish, haddock and hake, and saw 4 whales; it being the   first time I had ever seen that class of fish that swallowed Jonah.       18th, I left my wife and in company with Elder Hale,   ^I^ started to fill my mission on Fox islands, we walked to Portland   and spent the night at Mr. Samuel Hale's.      19th, We took the steamer Bangor & rode 85 miles to   Owls head, where we arrived at sunset, without means to prosecute   our journey further, we retired to a high hill, and bowed before the   Lord and prayed that he would open our way, the spirit of the   Lord rested upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers would   be answered; as we arose from our knees a sloop came into the   harbor, we went to the Captain and enquired where he was   going, he replied, through the channel of vinal Haven; he took  us on board and landed us on North Fox Islands, at 2 a.m.  on the 20th, it being very dark we wandered ^in the dark^ about for an   hour, rambling over the rocks and bushes, found the house of Mr.   Nathaniel Dyer where we ^&^ were entertained; it being sunday morning and   feeling anxious to commence our work, Mr. Benj. Kent piloted us to the  Baptist meeting house, occupied by Elder Gideon J. Newton, pastor of the   only religious denomination upon the Island, at the door, I sent for the   Deacon and told him I wished him to inform the minister that   we were servants of God and wished to deliver a message to that   people, the ^minister^ sent word for us to come into the pulpit, accordingly with   valize in hand, we walked up into the pulpit, and took a seat on   each side of him, when he closed his discourse, he asked me what hour     
 but I suffered much with the chills & fever Elder Taylor  up to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health but  the Destroyer did not intend to make him an exception  to the rest of the Apostles for on the 29 Aug he fell to  the ground as though he had been knocked down seemed to have  fainted away but soon revived but on the following day  it seemed as though the enemy made a powerful grasp  upon his life. He fainted away several times and seemed   as though he would die we stoped several times with  him at a home by the way side we then took him into  a waggon & drove to Brother Horace S Eldridge and spent  the remainder of the day & night [feeding] him and in  the morning Br Tayler recovered so for that he thought  he would be able to ride so we started on our journey  on the Morning of the 30 and we travelled 40 miles to  Louisville and spent the night with the family of Br  James Townsend. We felt terribly shaken up  being in such a weak state Br Townsend was absent  from home but we were kindly entertained by Sister Townsend  in the morning Elder Taylor though very weak felt disposed  to try to continue his journey. We traveled 14 miles to   Germantown was quite sick at night and seemed   to have the Billious fever setted settled upon him  and I was very feeble myself

 we would like to speak, I told him at 5, he gave out our appoint-  ment, and invited us to his house, I asked him how many school   houses there were on the island, he answered said, four, and gave me   their names, I asked him if they were free for any one to preach   in, he answered in the affirmative; I took out my bible, book of   Mormon, and doctrine and covenants and laid them all upon his   stand, he promised to read them.; the hour of meeting arrived,    I preached to a full house upon the first principles of the Gospel,   and bore testimony that the Lord had raised up a prophet, and   had commenced to establish his church and kingdom again upon   the earth, in fulfilment of the ^His^ word of God as spoken through   the ancient prophets and apostles; this was the first discourse   ever delivered by any latter-day Saints upon this chain of islands;   Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out appointments for preaching in   the four school houses, the people came out en masse to investigate   the principles which we taught, in 14 days we preached 19 discourses,  when Cap. Justice Ames and wife were baptized by Elder Hale, Elder   Newton, the baptist minister, with his family, attended twelve of our   meetings, read the books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord   that our doctrine was true, and he had a hard struggle for days in  his mind to know which to do, receive, or reject it, he finally resolved   to reject it, and took a stand against us, he & commenced preaching   against us, he also sent for Mr. Douglass, the Methodist Minister, on   the South Island, to come over and ^&^ help him; he had been long at   variance with Mr. Douglass, but they became ^very^ friendly and united in   a war against us;. We continued preaching daily until be we baptized   most of the members of Mr. Newton's church, and those who owned   the meeting house.      I followed Mr. Douglass home to his own island, and com-  menced preaching to his church, and baptized a good share of   his members;, among whom were several sea Captains. Ministers from   the main land were sent for, who came over and tryed to put  a stop to the work by preaching and lying about us; but the   work continued to roll on, they wished me to work a miracle   to convince them that my doctrine was true, I told them they     
 On the day following Sept 1, being Sunday Br Taylor   concluded to spend the day & hold a meeting it was  a German settlement Elder Taylor wished me to speak  which I did upon the first principles of the Gospel  Elder Taylor followed me & spoke untill he was  quite exhausted not realizing his bodily [condition]  we returned to the Inn where we were staying &  stopping I was taken with a chill & fever &   had a sick night and Br Taylor was quite  sick. And the following day sept 2 was a painful  day to my feelings. It was evident that Br Taylor  had a setted fever upon him and would not be  able to travel and Father Coultrin was resolved  to continue his journey and in consultation with  Taylor he thought it better for one sick man to be  left than for two as I was sick with the chills & fever  so that I was not co able to render him present assistance  and not able to take care of myself under these circumstances  Br Tayler advised me to continue with my journey with  Br Coltrin and make the best of my way to New-  York. Accordingly I done so After committing him 
 into the Hands of God though painful I took  the parting hand with him I left him in German-  town Wayne Co Indiana and in the Hands of a Merciful  God and a kind and benevolent family who promised   to do every thing in their power to make him comfortable  untill his recovery, which they did do though he  passed through a severe course of the Billious fever  and was sick night [nigh] unto death but through the  mercy of God he recovered from his sickness and  contiued his journey and we next met in the City  of New York I continued to journey with Father Coultrin  to Cleveland where we parted on the 10 Sept I went  on board of a steamer for Buffalo but was 3 days  and night in a storm before we made the Harbor and  when we did land it was midnight and do so we ran  into a schooner & stowe it in, from Buffalo I traveled to  albany in a canal boat and had a shake of the  ague daily while on the journey. At Albany I took stage  in the night and rode to my Fathers home in Farmington  on the 21st of Sept I had visited my Fathers family  on the in the summer of 1838 on my way to Fox  Islands on my second visit there and I had 
 had rejected the truth, and they would see signs, but not unto   salvation.      Vinal Haven includes both North and South Fox Island is   in Lat. 44°, Long 69° 10 '. The inhabitants are generally healthy,   industrious and hospitable to strangers, the people obtain most of   their wealth and living by fishing, and fit out annually over one   hundred licensed vessels, beside many smaller crafts. The north  Island is 9 miles long and 2 wide; population 800, a post office,   a store, a grist mill, 4 school houses, and a small branch of the  baptist church; the land is rather rocky and rough, yet there are   many good farms which produce good wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and   grass; the principal timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch,  rasp and goose berry grow in great abundance, sheep are the   principal stock.      South Fox island comes as near being without any form  as anthing I ever saw, and it would be difficult for a historian   to give a description of it, it is about 10 miles long and 5   wide, and is one universal ^a^ mass of rocks, much of it ^principally^ granite,  formed into shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into nooks, ^nooks^ points  and canons ^ravines.^ to make room for the ^by^ coves and harbors, which run through  and through the island, population 1,000.      I do not recollect of ever seeing a horse on either itsland,  there are some small patches ^of land^ under cultivation, but it is at the  expense of great labor and toil,.  Many ^resident^ fish^ermen,^ ^fish^ at New Foundland,   ^&^ bring their fish ^them^ home, and dry them upon flakes; they annually   supply the market with a great amount of codfish, mackerel and   boxed herring. The latter island contains two stores, three tide saw   mills, 6 school houses, a small branch of the Methodist church and   a priest. The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and birch,   also gooseberries, raspberries, and whortleberries and upland cranberries; bushes  and timber grow in a great measure out of the crevices of the rocks.       There is a great amount and variety of fish in the waters   coves and harbors around these islands, such as ^vizt:—^ whale, black fish,   shark, ground shark, pilot fish, horse mackarel, sturgeon, salmon,   Holloboat cod, Pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, mackarel, shad     
 baptized my father & his household including my step   mother & ownly sister & organized a small branch   of the Church there of nine members eight of which   were my blood relations and I was glad to meet   with them upon this occasion as I found them all   strong in the faith of the Gospel & glad to meet   with me I was still suffering with the Ague   daily. On the 27, Sept my Grand Mother (on my Mothers   side) Anna Thompson died 84 years of age at   Avon, it was a singular incident that she with   her husband Lot Thompson and Mercy Thompson and   Samuel Thompson all of one family died the   year they were 84 years of age I was not able  to attend my Grand Mothers Funeral. On the 4  Oct ^1839^ my uncle Adna Hart died aged 43 years I   had visited him in his sickness and preached the   Gospel to him and he was believing and on his   death bed sent me a request that I would preach   his funeral sermon I had been associated   with him from my youth up I was at the time   having the chills and fever daily afflicted with a severe 
 bass, alewives, herring, Pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost fish, flounders,  smelt, skate, shrimp, skad ^shad^, cusk, bluebacks, scollop, dogfish,   muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fingers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish   swordfish, ^thrasher, cat, scuppog, twotog, eye fish, [canner] cunner, Ling. V eels, also lobsters^ clams, mussels, wrinkels, porpoises, seals &c. &c.      Sep 6, the harbor was filled with a school of mackerel,  which were caught in great numbers with by the poeple standing upon   the wharf.      While standing upon the farm of Eleazur Carven^er^ on the   north island I counted fifty five islands, many of which were   inhabited.      Oct. 2nd, I left the island with Elder Hale, Cap. Ames took   us to Thomastown in a sloop.      3rd, We walked 46 miles to Bath.      4th, We attended a baptist convention, in and preached  to a large congregation in the evening in Pierce's hall: the people   listened attentively.       5th, we walked 36 miles to Portland.      6th, walked 10 miles to father Carter's in Scarborough, Maine, where I found my wife and friends well.      9th, I parted with Elder Hale, who returned to   Kirtland, I continued preaching through various towns on the main   land until Nov. 2, when I again returned to Fox islands, accom-  panied by my wife.      15th, I visited the isle of He^H^olt 12 miles east, and   preached to an attentive congregation, and left ^leaving^ them the book of   mormon which they promised to read, and ^I^ returned on the 16th.,      I continued by labors during the winter of 1837–8,  and nearly every person had attended my meetings, and taken sides   for, or against. Our enemies made attempts to break up our   meetings.      Jan. 15, 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the united   states revenue cutter, brought on shore a swivel and joined the   mob, parading near the house where I was preaching, and discharged   it several times, followed by ^accompanied with^ small arms, with the intention of   breaking up the meeting; some of the mob gathered around     
 cough so much so that my Father never thought  I should never leave the home alive but when  they brought me the request of my dying uncle and the  day came for the Funeral, I told my Father to get his  hors & buggy ready for I was going to attend the funeral  He thought I was very presumtious as I had suffered  with the chills and fever some 15 days for and to   attempt to speak in my weak state and to begin  at the same hour that my chill was to come on  was quite alarming to my parents yet according to my  request my [Father] got up his team and I rode with him  and my step Mother five miles through a cold chilly  wind and I commenced speaking to a large congregation  at the same hour still my chills was to come on  and I spoke over one hour with Great freedom  and my chills left me from that hour and I  had no more return from it for many days  On the Monday following Oct 7, I felt sufficiently  returned to health to continue my journey I took the  parting hand with my Father, Mother, & Sister and  left for New York where I arrived in the Morning of the 8th Nov 
 to see what effect this would have, I warned them in the   name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgements of God that   awaited the wicked, and shook my garments in the presence of   the people, and told them I was clear of their blood,  byut they   only heard my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon and   musketry; before I closed speaking, the sailors went back on board   of the revenue cutter. At the close of the meeting I baptized   2, two, also one next day, and while baptizing the mob again   commenced firing guns.  The bBaptists and Methodists got up the   mob. Mr. Douglass, the methodist priest, when argument failed him,  applied to all the magistrates for warrants against me; they   refused to grant them, as he had no cause of complaint but  religious persecution.      Feby. 13, I crossed in the mail boat to Hampden,   and ordained James Townsend; we walked together through   deep snows, and visited and preached in the towns of Searsmont,  Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hampden, and twice in the city   hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, and returned to Fox islands  via Casteem and the isle of Holt — arrived in Vinal haven   March 8,: Elder Townsend returned home.      March 22, I accompanied bro. Stirrat at low tide, on   to a bar some 40 rods from shore, to dig some clams, we   were soon joined by Mrs. Woodruff and a sister Stone, who had   a curiosity to see how clams were dug; the ground for about   12 rods nearer shore was several feet lower than the point   we were on, we were so busily engaged we did not observe   the flowing tide until we were surrounded by water, and   having no boat, our only alternative was to wade ashore   and carry the women, which we safely accomplished amid the   relection that tide nor time waited for no man.      April 4, Mr. Kent, the post master, showed me a letter   containing two sheets of foolscap signed by Warren Parrish and several  of the Twelve, who had apostatized and been cut off from the church,   the communication was full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph   Smith and the Prophet and all that stood by him; it was sent     
 I spent two months & seven days after my arrival  in New York in travelling & preaching in New York  New Jersey & Long Island a portion of the time  with parly & Orson pratt I had freequent attacks  during this time of the chills & fever but I preached  almost daily d on the 13 of Dec I attended a  Conference in New York City with Parly P Pratt  and on that day Elder John Taylor arrived in  our midst and it was a happy meeting he had  passed through a severe time of sickness after we  parted but through the mercy [ink blot] of God had been  preserved and was able to continue his journey. He   also informed us that all of the others of the quorum  of the Twelve had suffered a great deal of sickness and  that it was with difficulty that they could travel    After spending 6 days in New York John Taylor Wilford   Woodruff & Theodore Turley sailed out of New York  Harbor for Liverpool on board of the packet ship Oxford  On the 19th day of Dec 1839 and in the Liverpool docked  on the 11th Dec ^Jan^ making the voyage from New York to  Liverpool in 23 days we took steerage passage 
 the marriage carrimony was performed by Frederick G Williams ^Esqr^ and we were  blessed by the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen The Prophet Joseph was expecting to  marry us but his life was sought by a mob and he had to flee from his house  and hide himself us his house was guarded day and night by his brethren  Elder Johnathan Homes was married at the same time to Mariet Carter daughter  of John S Carter On the 15 of April I received my Patriarchel Blessings  under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen. My wife ^having^ received her patriarchal  blessings ^from him^ under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph Smith, sen Nov 10 1836.  On the 5th May while labouring for Joseph Young we were visited with a  sudden storm of wind and rain a vain of it past south of the Temple in the  form of a whirlwind or tornado which destroyed and injured several buildings  it crushed one of Elders Youngs buildings and removed the one we were in ^some 10 feet^ but no  person was injured soon all was calm again. On Sunday May 28 Joseph Smith  addressed the people in the Temple upon the subject of the apostacy in the Church in Kirtland  the spirit of murmuring complaining, and aposticy had increased throughout Kirtland  untill it was almost difficult to tell who was Joseph friends and who were not  this spirit had been incresed in the family circle in secret chambers, and in the streets  untill many ^had apostitized^ were apostitizing not both in high places and through the whol body  of the Church and many were taking strong grounds against Joseph they were  trying to cast him down and destroy his influence. This grieved Joseph to the  heart to have to pass through such perils among fals brethren. But notwithstanding  this thick cloud of darkness which hung over Kirtland Joseph ^He^ remained unmoved  in the cause of God and was determined to magnify his calling and leave the evil  in the hand of God. At this time the number of his friends that occupied high station  in the Church that had faith and moral courage to stand by him shoulder to shoulder   were vary few among the number was Brigham Young who stood by him in evry   trial he was also sustained by Heber C Kimball Sidney Rigdon and a few others  it was in the midst of this scene of things that Joseph entered the stand  congregation and arose in the stand and spoke to the people in the name of the Lord in his  own defence the Lord was with him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the   honest in heart that he would stand while his enemies would fall. Sidney  Rigdon followed him as he did several others and sustained him in his position  Warren Parrish spoke against him in the bitterness of his heart as had some of the  twelve before, but the people could discern the difference of the spirit between Joseph and  his enemies. But Joseph came off triumphant in all of his difficulties and accusations  that came from fals brethren or his persecution from the world    While in the mist of this scene of things in Kirtland I felt impressed to go out upon  a mission the spirit that was upon me lead me to go to Fox Islands called 
 which cost $15 each, we had storms & rough  weather, but most of the winds were favorable for  a quick passage while on the passage some Methodist  priest got into an argument against some Catholics  who were in the company, and the arguments of the priests  ran rather more into abuse than sound argument  and Elder Taylor told the Methodist priest that  he did not think it was becoming in a daughter  to find so much fault with the mother as they  did for as the Methodist came out from the   Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the Mother had  as much right [ink blot] to enjoy their religion  unmolested as the daughter had that closed  the argument, our company consisted of 109 saints  composed of Englishmen Americans Englishman sct  schotish scotish, Irish, Welsh & Dutch,  [rest of page blank] 
 with the intention of breaking up the work upon these islands,   but it did not accomplish it.      11th, I was visited by Elders Townsend and Milton   Holmes, who attended conferences with me upon both islands, and   bore their testimony to the people, but the spirit of opposition   increased to a great height. I was warned by the spirit ^of the Lord^  to leave for a season, and take a western mission; after visiting   the saints from house to house, and praying with, and encour-  aging them, I left on the 28th, and went to the main land   with Elders Townsend & Holmes. Mrs. Woodruff returned to her Fathers;.   We walked to Scarborough;— & I left May 7th, and walked to Brad-  ford where I left Elder Holmes, and proceeded to Boston.      11th, I gave out an appointment to preach at Sister   Vose's room, & I went to Cambridgeport to visit Elder A. P. Rock-  wood who had been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,  but in reality out of religious persecution; the jailor locked me   in until 10 p.m.; but while it disappointed a congregation of   people, it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood, conversing   upon the work of God. On my return to Boston the people   were waiting to hear me, I spoke to them a short time.      14th, I left Boston and walked some 30 miles to   Holliston, staid at Deacon Hoveys^aven's^ and preached; I walked to   Providence, R.I., from thence took steamer to New York and   arrived on the 18th, met with and attended meetings with bro.   O. Pratt until the 27th, when I went up the North river to   Newburgh and preached in several towns in New York & New Jersey,  and walked accross the country to Farmington Conn. and arrived   at my fathers house June 11, (1838)      I commenced preaching at my fathers house; July   1st, I baptized six persons in Farmington river, including my Father,   step mother and my ownly sister, Eunice, also cousin Seth Woodruff,   aunt Anna Cossett and Dwight Webster, a Methodist class leader,   who was boarding at my Fathers house.      When the Patriarch Joseph Smith Sen. gave me my   blessing, he said, I should bring my fathers household into

After various 
 principles of the Church had been explained by the  Twelve present the Council adjorned Elder Willard  Richards had been called to be one of the Quorum  of the Twelve but had not yet received his ordination  On the day following I parted with Elder  Taylor & Fielding who wet went to Liverpool &  with Elder Richards who tarried in preston  and Elder Turley & myself went to Manchester  the first time I ever visited that City, I here  met with Elder William Clayton for the first time  as soon as I had an introduction to him  he informed me that one of the Sisters in the place  was possessed of the devil and he asked me to go and  cast him out of her Thinking that one of the Twelve  Apostles could do any thing they were a mind to. However  I went with him to the home where the woman lay in  the hands of three men in a terrible rage and trying  to tare her clothing off from her I also found quite  a number of Saints present and some unbelievers who  hagd come to see the devils cast out as a miricle  wrought.
