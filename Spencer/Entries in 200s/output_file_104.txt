 DECLARATION.As rumors have been circulated andpublished, accusing the Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with interference in politi-cal affairs, so as to control elections andto direct members of the Church as towhich political party they should sup-port, we hereby declare these rumorsto be false and without foundation in fact. We emphatically deny that we,or either of us, authorized Mr. GeorgeF. Gibbs or any other person or personsto use our names so as to influencecitizens to vote the Republican ticket, at Logan or elsewhere. If our names have been used in anysuch way, it has been entirelywithout permission from us, and we hereby condemn it as wrong and re-prehensible. If we have any desire in this matter it is that the people ofthis Territory shall study well the prin-ciples of both the great national par-ties, and then choose which they will join, freely, voluntarily and honestly,from personal conviction, and thenstand by it in all honor and sincerity.Each party should have the samerights, privileges and opportunities asthe other. If any man claims that itis the wish of the First Presidency thata Democrat shall vote the Republicanticket, or a Republican the Democra-tic ticket, let all people know that he is endeavoring to deceivethe public and has no authorityof that kind from us. We have nodisposition to direct in these matters,but proclaim that, as far as we are con-cerned, the members of this Churchare entirely and perfectly free in all political affairs. But they should notindulge in in ill-feeling or personalities.President George Q. Cannon is absent,but we are sure that if he were here hewould sign this declaration with us.WILFORD WOODRUFF,JOSEPH F. SMITH,Of the Presidency of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

 AN OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT.On the 5th of the present month, to the great surprise of the public, the following official en-dorsement of Col. Isaac Trumbo appeared as a leading editorial in the News. People were still wondering what it meant when the Colonel was made the topic of discourse in the Taber-nacle last Sunday afternoon. Here is the letter:There have been many communications of late in the newspapers concering Colonel IsaacTrumbo and his affairs. Charges have been made, emanating from various sources, that there has been some financial connection between him-self and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. It has been repeatedly stated in years past, and the story has been revived of late, that Colonel Trumbo has had large amounts of money in his hands and under his control belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;that he has been its agent in the expenditure of funds for the accomplishment of certain ends that were desired to be achieved.We have remained silent upon this subject.It is well known that from time to time charges are made and circulated concerning us and our affairs, which we deem it unnecessary to notice.It would be occupying too much of our time to be contradicting stories which are put in circula-tion by one and another for their own purposes. This feeling has restrained us in the past in rela-tion to Colonel Trumbo and his connection with us and our affairs. But it seems to be propernow, and just to ourselves, as well as common justice to him, that we should say something inrelation to the association that has existed be-tween Colonel Isaac Trumbo and ourselves as the representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.First of all we wish to state most emphatically that Colonel Trumbo has not had property of ours in his possession FOR SUCH PURPOSESES AS AL-LEDGED. He has neither been our financialagent, nor had any control of our property. We have not entrusted him with amounts of money to expend for us FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE.In the time of our deep distress, when bitter-ness and hatred were manifested against us in almost every public quarter, Colonel Trumbocame to Utah, and showed interest in our affairs.Some of his own relatives were involved in cases that were then before the courts. One promi-nent connection of his was consigned to the pen-itentiary, on the common charge that was in vogue against so many prominent Latter-Day Saints. The colonel's sympathies, it seems,were aroused, at least in behalf of his kinsfolk.This caused him to take interest in the whole question; and this interest absorbed him to such an extent that he withdrew from profitable busi-mess that he had at the time in San Francisco, and devoted himself almost exclusively to the labor of correcting the false impressions which prevailed and to the enlistment of the press in the correction of many falsehoods and asper-tions which were in circulation; and afterwards,on a wider field, using his influence with leading men of the nation. We may say here that Colo-nel Isaac Trumbo is a man of extraordinary ener-gy. When he undertakes anything that he thinks ought to be done, he is untiring in his ef-forts to accomplish it. These characteristics were wonderfully illustrated in the labors which he took upon himself in behalf of the malignedand misreprhsented Latter-Day Saints. Being a man of means, HE WAS ABLE to travel from place to place, and especially to visit and SUSTAIN HIMSELF at Washington. We can never forget his activity in visiting editors and using his influence to correct public opinion through the press. No man could have dislayed greater zeal and disin-terestedness than he did in the labors that he took upon himself. We felt that he was inspired; for, not being a member of our religious organi-zation, and HAVING NO FINANCIAL ENDS TO ACCOM-PLISH that would be remunerative to him, there was nothing to incite him to these extraordinary exertions except a purely philanthropic desire to defend an oppressed and unpopular people and to roll back the tide of calumny and evil that threatened to overwhelm them. We felt thank-ful many times for the kind Providence that raised him up; for he seemed to come to our aid when a man in his position and with his indefa-tigable energy was especially needed.When the Mormon people were threatenedwith disfranchisement, Col. Trumbo spent con-siderable time in Washington, exerting himselfto the utmost of his ability to defeat that infam-ous measure. And while there were other agencies also at work (for every one that had any influence in the community realized how neces-sary it was that this measure should be defeated),still Colonel Isaac Trumbo was the means of bringing powerful influences to bear against the enactment of that villainous bill. In the defeatof the proposed legislation every member of our Church had cause to be deeply grateful to the Lord and to the instruments which, under Him,were the means of bringing it to naught.With the same zeal and devotedness he worked untiringly to obtain the amnesty; and also afterwards in securing the return of the per-sonal property to the Church, and in preparing the way for the return of the real estate.He threw himself into the accomplishment of all these ends with an energy and wholeness of soul that won him many friends and crowned hislabors and the labors of those who worked with with success.Colonel Trumbo was most fortunate in win-ning the respect and admiration of influentialmen in the nation. By his representations of the condition of things in the then Territory of Utah and his enthusiastic defense of the Mormon people, he aroused the active interest and sympa-thies of very many of them. This was notably the case with General James S. Clarkson. This gentleman was deeply moved by all that helearned, and he entered with his whole soul and great influence, with Colonel Trumbo, into the effort to make the true character of the peopleknown to the nation and to remove the wide-spread and deeprooted prejudices which existedso generally at that time against the Mormon people. It would be invidious perhaps to at-tempt to give names of other leading and influen-tial public men who, by the powerful appealswhich were made to them, were induced to ex-amine what was known as the Mormon question from a different standpoint to that which they had occupied; but their names are cherished in grateful remembrance by the men of Utah, and their deeds will be preserved in the history of the people. All the influence which he had gained by personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo used to make the people of Utah better known to the nation at large, and towards preparing the way for the admission of Utah as a State. It is not necessary for us to go into details concerninghis labors in this direction; it is sufficient to say that probably no single agency contributed so much to making Utah a State as the labors of Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his immediate friends.WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON,JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff said the time in which we live is the most interesting era in the World's History â€” a time in which work can be performed both for the living and dead; a dispensation in which a great many things that have been hidden shall be revealed. To fullfil the purposes of the Lord in placing us here should be uppermost in our minds. He felt anxious to have the people do as much as possible for their dead. With regard difficulties that may arise let us settle them between ourselves. "Go to law and you build up the lawyers only." 
 Pres W Woodruff addressed the Saints saying When the Lordcontemplates doing any work on the earth He always prepares an ele-ment to accomplish it. Referring to himself, he related his own ex-periences in his youthful days, when he was animated by the spirit of enquiry after truths. In due time the Elder's of the Church camealong & preached the Gospel. He at once received it & was bap-tised. He was prepared to receive the Gospel when it came. Hehad lived to see Apostles & Prophets, the gifts & blessings of theGospel made manifest among man & he hoped every young man& woman would seek after these things & Search after the thingsof the Lord. He referred to the Priesthood & its potency for good am-ong men, without which no connecting link can be made betweenearth & Heaven. He referred to the 121st Section of the Book ofDoc & Cov which states that but "few are chosen" to be vessels of theLord & He remarked his experience in preaching the Gospel without purse or scrip & he had hoped that all the Elders would do solikewise for wherever he did so, the Lord had blessed him greatly.He set forth that it made no difference what Priesthood a manholds, if he will magnify the same, the Lord will sustain himas much as He will an Apostle. He was not in favor of ord-daining so many Elders to be Seventies thus decimating the Eldersquorums &c. He urged that every man who holds any Priesthoodshould magnify the same honestly before the Lord. Hespoke approvingly of the operations of the Female Relief So-ciety as an organization. He gave counsel not to ordain ouryoung men to higher positions in the Priesthood until it wasapparent that they have magnified that which they have had.He impored the blessing of the Lord to rest on the people. 
 Pres W Woodruff said, No sect was free from the union of Church & statethan was our church. In England our Elders have always respected the government & the officers have always protected us. This is Mormonism to sustain any government where we are that will sustain us. The Prophet Joseph always taught that the Saints should sustain the government & laws of the United States. Had the policy of the Pro-phet been carried out in regard to slavery the civil war would have been avoided. Ours is the grandest government founded on the most just constitution of any country on the earth, but if it takes a cause to break a its constitution a people will be foundhere in these mountains who will be inspired to save that constitution. 
 Pres Woodruff again spoke directing his remarks in relation tothe Sugar Factory & explaining the et ceteras involved in this raisingof vast Sums of money. He hoped the Saints would assist all intheir power towards erecting the Factory. He explained the objectof the Defence Fund & hoped to live long enough to see all the debtsof the Church paid up. Benedication by Pres F D RichardsJames A Leishassman Stake Clerk 
 Pres Woodruff said, In regard to the Manifesto. He thought heunderstood our people & situations. The plans were laid to take ourTemples from us & stop our Sacred ordinances & they would haveaccomplished it, had not the Lord told me to give the ManifestoIt was contrary to my personal feelings, & I would not have takenthe step without the inspiration of the Spirit. My Counselors& the Apostles have the testimony for themselves. This does not meanthat any man should neglect or cast aside his wives or childrenany more than before. In honoring the law, families must notbe cast aside

 Comstock, Kalamazoo, Co. Michigan, June 1st 1844Father & Mother Woodruff,Dear parents.I feel Disposed to address a fewlines to you to infoerm you that I have commenced my Summerwork ie to attend a long list of Conferences which lie through the westernmiddle & New England States. You probably may have seen the list ofcoferences which we publish in the Times & Seasons, but lest you mighthave missed of it I will make metion of it here. The following placesthe quoroum of the Twelve were Expecting to visit. Quincy, Princes Grove, Ottaway& Chicago, in Illinois. Comstock, Pleasant Valley, & Franklin, Michigan.Kirtland, Ohio. Lockport, Batavia, Portage, Hamilton, Oswego, Adams, London,State of New York. Boston, Salem, New Bedofrd, Mass Petersboroug N. H. Scarborough& Vinal Haven, Maine. Westfield Mass July 27 & 28 (Farmington Aug 3th.New Haven July 13, ^&^ 14, Aug 10, ^&^ 11, Canan Aug 17, 18 Norwalk 24, 25, Connecticut)New York City, Philadelphia, Washington City Sept 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, &c. I Expect to attend those Conferences on mostof them especially, Westfield Farmington & New Haven so you may Expect avisit from me the first of August I shall be thare on the 3 & 4th if the Lord will & probablysome of the Twelve with me; I dont know what a chance their will be for aConference in Farmington but I thought I would appoint one any how &pay you a visit of nothing more, for I do not intend at any time togo through New England without calling at my fathers house. We understandthat the work is prospering well in the regions of New Haven so it will benecessary to hold a conference there, & we have approved an Elder to go toHartford that will be capable of meeting any thing that that City can present.Perhaps the people in Farmington would like to come out to attend one of ourConferences & some good might be done. I should be pleased to haveUncle Ozem Woodruff to be there & as many of his family as feel disposed AuntHannah &c. Aunt [Anna Hart Cossett|Cossett & Betsey, Bulah &c if they are alive & able & all who haveany friendly feelings. I have not heard from Aunt Cossetts family sinceI herd from Betsey By letter which gave a distressing accoung of her mother. Ihave often remembered her in my prayers but know not how she isNeither have I herd any thing from Dwight & Eunice since they wroteme that they were coming west I suppose they have gone but know notI moved my family into the new house the day before I left. Igot two rooms done off & the rest of the house is not finished for I 
 Could not get seasoned lumber, but they can go into thehouse we mooved out of untill he can lay a floor in a room inthe new House & then they will comfortable. I left my family well& in good spirits, my life & lot seems to be mostly in the vineyardI left Nauvoo about the first of May in company with Elder G. A. Smithone of the Twelve, to attend the Conferences. I expect to meet with EldersB Young & H. C. Kimball at Kirtland Ohio. Elders O. Pratt, O Hyde,J. E. Page & L. Wight are in the City of Washington with petitionsto Congress & preaching the gospel, we all have a general Conference thereof about a week in month of Sept. It has been a vary wet springin this western country, we have traveled most of our time since weleft home in the raine mud & water. We have held meetings in allthe large towns & villages on our route & delivered both religious & politicallectures & prejudice is giving way like a flood all through the Country.we have held our Conferences thus far & had a good time. I am now inthe midst of the Comstock Branch of about 50 members & surrounded by about40 Elders from Nauvoo & other parts as good spirits as ever breathed ready to opena conference in a few minutes. Perhaps some of our friends abroadthink strange that we are engaged in political matters & running a candidatefor the presidency, but when they hear our reasons for thus doing they willsee we are fully justified. Our polittical lectures have done much good inBreaking down Prejudice in fine the whole western world is open to investigateour principle, & the kingdom is rolling on. I expect if Br Webster &Eunice is gone you are some lonesome, so if I pay you a visit now itmay fill up the vaccum of their abscence for a day or towo. I feel anxious tosee you again, But I must lay down my pen & go to conference.June 3rd. Monday We have had a good time for two days past. we have had aninteresting Conference, their being 36 Elders present including the Twelve,High Council, High Priests, & Elders, the work is progressing rapidly onEvery land. We had an interesting conference at Nauvoo {shorthand}the 6th of April Before I left, the most interesting probably the Churchever held. About twenty thousand persons were present & itwas judged their was three thousand Elders present, many Clergymenof different Denominations attended. President Smith preacha great Sermon upon death, resurrection & Eternal Judgement, whichpresented great & glorious ideas to the mind of man. many Embracedthe work on that occasion. 
 I should be pleased to meet all our friends or relations atyour house that have faith in the work, but if I see no moreit will be a consolation to meet my father & Mother, the longerI live, the more advanced you are in life the more I essteem it a favor to look upon your faces, & when I contemplate the thoughtthat you are like Old father Jacob not ownly bereaved of one Sonbut of evry Son & Daughter & left alone to pass away your feelingdeclineing hours in silence with not a child to see or knowyour cares, it at times causes me sorrow, but then againthat sorrow is checked with a certain knowledge that it is my priviledgeto meet with you in the first ressurection & enjoy a mansion inthe Celestial Kingdom of God with my father & Mother & Brother& as far as I have any influence with the kingdom of God, it shallbe used to accomplished this purpose, the more I understandas touching Eternal things the ^more^ interested I feel in the welfareof my kindred, I have quite a desire of late to feel atfeafter.Br Azm[on][page torn] & Thompson I trust before they die to see the[m][page torn]in the c[ove][page torn]ant. I know the more a man understa[nds][page torn]the gospel, the Keys & Kingdom & Eternal things the more his he[page torn]will be sealed to his Parents & his Children, this was the spirit thatcharacterized all the prophets & patriarchs from Abel toZachariah; I would like to spend more of my life in yourcompany, but I am not ownly sacrificing the socity of myparents but my wife & Children for the great work of thisdispensation. I have not herd from Br Azmon I thatsince he wrote you while I was East I intend to write hima letter as soon as I get time. If Dwight & Eunice iswith you my respects to them of course. I feel anxiousto learn about them, if you can have an opportunity of givingnotice to Sister Betsy I should be pleased to see her at the FarmingtonConferece, I dont know how her Mother is, or how she will besituated, give my Respects to Sister Hooker & Jennett & all theSaints or friends who inquire after me, I dont knowbut your will be troubled to read my writing, for I havewritten in great heaste & surrounded by many many.As Ever I am yours with respectWilford Woodruff

 [sideways text] Artha StanyersOn SugarOct 20 [18]87Answered Oct 20 [18]87Stayner [end of sideways text]Salt Lake City UtahOct 20th 1887President Wilford Woodruff:Dear BrotherPardon me for again intruding uponyour time and attention, but the magnitude ofthe interest involved and the exigency of its imme-diate handling must plead my excuse.The days of doubting and experiment in the ^Sorghum^Sugar Industry are gone by and are supersededby actual knowledge and an output whichplaces the business as one of the most impor-tant and for some years to come the most profit-able of all home industries.Seeing the fruition of my hopes and experiencesin the success of the Fort Scott Factory and wishingto know of a surety with regard to the truth of theStatements made, I took my son Horace withme and visited the works at Fort Scott; We saw,during three days we remained there, for ourselvesthe actual demonstration of the successful man-ufacture of Sugar from the Sorghum Cane by 
 Salt Lake City, Utah,August 22, 1887.President Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Twelve:Dear Brethren;I am constrained to address you and ask yoursanction and approval to my opening up and publishinga Paper dedicated to the interests of Producers generally, but especially the Farmers. During the past few years,I have given much attention to the interests of Agriculture,and I have long been convinced of the utility, acccoun-ting to a necessity, of such a publication. My interestin behalf of the Producer aids me to see that there arenot within the reach of the Farmers of this Territory themeans of instruction and learning peculiar to theirbusiness that are ordinarily accessible to persons oftheir class in other States and Territories. There being no local publication devoted to their interestsexclusively they are at the mercy of foreign adven-turers, who palm off upon them cheap and com-paratively worthless publications which are gotten up 
 Diffusion. We saw the cane brought in on thefarmer's wagons, weighed, conveyed into the Factoryand watched it through all the processes and thesugar came forth ready for market.We also verified the statement with regard tooutput by information from the Company's booksshowing how many tons of cane had been receivedup to date and the figures of the sugar realizedwe obtained from the book of the Kansas Stateagent who certifies to the amount entitlled to Countyof which the State pays 2Â¢ per lb. Comparisonof these two amounts shows a little more than100 lbs of sugar to the ton of cane; the sugaraveraging from 92 to 98% sweet.The business in Utah covers an annual outlay of about one and a quarter millions of dollars andwill pay a profit of from 20 to 40% on the capitalinvested. For the Servants of God to control a businessof this magnitude is surely an object of interest solong as we are not fed with manna from heavenbut have to supply our temporal wants by theuse of the elements placed under our control and 
 so long as it is expected that "the Church shall stand independent of every creature beneath thecelestial world"Our friends on the outside are ready to graspthis thing unless it is taken up by this people. I have been solicited to write on this subject, sincemy return, for publication but have withheldfrom doing so awaiting an interview with you.If it be altogether impracticable to accordme an interview, would you like to appointa Committee of one or more, say Bro JamesJack and Bro Clawson to investigate mystatements and report to youVery earnestly and respectfully submittedYour Brother in the GospelArthur Stayner 
 and thirty five lbs to the ton.This advance isn output is due, primarily, to the principleof diffusion as a means of extracting the saccharine fromSugar producing plants, and next, to certain patentedprocesses which I have the control of in this Territory.I now earnestly crave the privilege of an interview atyour early convenience, that I may lay before you somematters pertaining to this vast & valuable industry.Very respectfullyYour Brother in the GospelArthur Stayner 
 on purpose to carry the advertisements of Quack Doctors and"bogue Jewelry" Manufacturers, and which have been in-dustriously circulated amongst the Farmers and others ofthis Territory; the chief attractions of these papers being theirlow cost, a few items of information called from goodpublications, and one or two "blood and thunder" stories ofthe lowest and cheapest style.I think that a paper devoted to the interests of our FarmersManufacturers, Stock, Sheep & wool raisers, calling forth correspondence upon practical matters locally important,and giving in a concise and condensed form the best and most appropriate ideas from foreign journals,and bringing before our producing population someeasy grades of scientific information for their develop-ment, and paving the way for an Agriculturaland Mechanical Institution in the near future,would certainly be much more desirable than thetrashy & in many instances improper literature ^from abroad^to which the people are now sedulously invited to subscribe. The lack of such a paper as I proposeto establish is so manifestly felt that, doubtless,

 if the want be not supplied from some controllable sourcewithin a short time, it will be supplied by some such party as the Chamber of Commerce or some other party havingmoney making solely, and not the true interests of the people,at heart.It is the furthest thing from my wishes to Endeavor towork up or Encourage a Boom here; I have not gotthe same desire as the Chamber of Commerce in inducingforeigners to come here to locate, my interest is solelyand entirely to benefit those of our faith who are herebecause of their faith, and many of whom not findinghere the trade or work to which they had been apprenticed,and with which alone they were familiar, have been forced into the ranks of the Farmers, unskilful andignorant of the secrets of the soil; to such, a little palpablereasonable, plain instruction given in the spirit of a wellwisher would assuredly be a help. And to all, some hints and instructions in advanceof their present information would be invaluable, leadingthem along from one improvement to another in theskilful manipulation of the Elements of nature, would 
 in a short time manifest a marked improvementin those important interests, Agriculture, Stock andWool raising and Manufactures.Through a source of this kind, statistical informationregarding the quantity and kinds of produce raised couldbe collated and disseminated to the profit of producers, who, if well posted, would frequently bend their energies in adirection which would supply a demand unprovided for instead of adding to an already plethoric supplyof some common article sold, because of its quantity,below the cost of production. It seems to me to be verypalpably evident that branches of industry soin which the people of the Territory are so largely interested shouldbe and are worthy of the publication of a paper devotedprincipally if not exclusively to their interests.I therefore propose, if I can meet with your approval,to publish such a paper, monthly to commence with,at the nominal cost of $1.50 a year, having been in-formed and feeling assured that the people will warm-ly welcome such a paper and support it liberally.And in return for patronage I will devote an un- 
 deviating and sincere interest to the paeople's true tem-poral welfare, and by careful research and prudentstudy place before them such instructions, hints and suggestions as shall make a marked improvementin the results of their labours.I trust you may see fit to give this undertakingyour countenance and blessingVery respectfullyYour Brother in the GospelArthur Stayner

 History of Wilford Woodruff.(From his own pen)In tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficultto obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family, for morethan three generations.My ^Great^ Grandfather, Josiah Woodruff, lived nearly one hundredyears, of age and possessed an strong iron constitution and performeda great amount of manual labor nearly up to the time of hisdeath. His wife's name was Sarah; she bore to him ninechildren as follows;â€” Josiah, Appleton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda,Phebe and two names not given.My Grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of[page covered] he was born in Farmington, Hartford Co., Connecticut[page covered] heâ—Š father ^also^ possessed a strong constitution; it was said, that[page covered] d the most labor for several years of any man inHartford Co., and from over exertion in hewing timber he wasattacked with rheumatism in his right hip, which caused a severelameness, for several years before his death. He married DinahWoodford by whom he had seven children as follows, vizt. :â€” EldadElizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, He-Ellen and Ozem.Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Elizabeth, Amasa Frisby;Samuel, Miss Case; Aphek, Beulah Thompson and Hannah ^Azubah^ Hart; Titus,Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos Wheeler; and Ozem, Acksah Merrill and HannahHart; all of these had numerous families, unions were productivewhom had large families.My Grandfather died in Farmington, with the spotted feverin 1806, aged 55 years. My Grandmother, Dinah, Woodruff died in1824, in the same place, with a cancer in the left breast: hersufferings were very great.My Father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in FarmingtonNov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah Thomson, who was born in 1782,Nov., 29, 1801. She bore to him three children ^sons^, ^namely:â€”^ Azmon born Nov., 29,1802; Ozen Thompson born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born March, 1, 1807.My mother died with the spotted fever, June, 11, 1808, aged 
 26 years, leaving me 15 months old. My Father's married forhis second wife, Azup^b^ah Hart, was born July, 31, 1792; they weremarried Nov., 9, 1810; and ^they^ had six children,. vizt.:â€” Philo bornNov., 29, 1811;, and died by poison administered by a physician Nov.,25, 1827; aged 16 years; Asahil Hart born April, 11, 1814, anddied in Terrahaute, Oct., 18, 1838; aged 24 Franklin born March12, 1816, and died June 1, 1816; Newton born June 19, 1818,drowned Sep. 1820; Julius born April 22, 1820, and died ininfancy; Eunice born June 19, 1820^1^. I married her to DwightWebster in Farmington Conn. Aug. 4, 1841. My father, Aphek was a strong constitutioned man, andhas done a great amount of labor.

March 1, 1807.I assisted my Father in attending the Farmington Mills, until Iwas 20 years of age. / In the Spring of ^April,^ 1827 I took the flouringmill of my Aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I attended three years.In the Spring of  ^May,^ 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr.Collins, the ax manufacturer, in south Canton, Conn., at the end of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery.In the spring of ^March,^ 1831 I took charge of the flouring mill ownedby Mr. Richd. B. Cowleys of New Hartford, Conn. In the Sp^r^ing ^stet^of ^stet^ 1832, in company with my oldest brother Azmon, I went toRichland, Owego Co., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill,and settled down in business for ourselves.At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious 
 History of Wilford Woodruff concludedheading for printersChapter of Accidentswritten G. S. L. City February, 1858Varied and diverse are the lives and fortunesof men, while the paths of some are strewen with flowers and ease from the cradle to the gravewith naught to disturbe their peace, others apparently are marked victims of variated misfortunes, accidents, and dangers; the last named class is the one, in whose ranks I have stoood stood, thro'my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood, up to the present time, so ^much so,^ that it has seemed as though some invisaible power or fate was watching my ^foot^steps, in order to find some opportunity to take my life from the earth; I can only attribute the continuation of my life on Earth to the present time, to a merciful God, whose hand has been stretched out and rescued me from death in the midst of many ^of the^ many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I have passed through, some of which I will here mention. When 3 years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water, was instantly caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine months fbefore I was considered out of danger. When at 5 years of age, I fell from the great beam of a barn rafters ^striking^ my bare face upon the floor, which came near breaking my neck. Three months afterwards, I broke one of my arms, by falling down a pair of stairs; I soon after broke my other arm by falling out of a high stoop, upon a pile of timber. When six years of age, I came near being killed by a surly Bull. ^see people apart^ and was only savedby as it were by a miracle, ^Â¶^ dDurring the same year, I went into my fathers saw mill, with several others. I got upon the headblock to take a ride while the carriage was running back, not anticipating any danger, but before I was aware, my leg was caught 
 between the headblock and the fender post, and broke both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the house and lay nine hours before my bones were set, which time was spent amidst ^suffering severe pain, but being young my bones soon knitt together and in a few days, I was again upon my feet; during my confinement, by this lameness, my bro., Thompson, was my companion in the same room going through with a course of the typhus fever. When 7 years of age, I was riding on the top of a load of hay, which my uncle,Ozen Woodruff, was driving to the barn, he turned the load over upon me. I was nearly strangled for the want of air, before the hay was removed. ^Â¶^At 8 years of age ^old^ I was riding in a one horse wagon with several others, the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and turned the wagon over upon us; but again while in the midst of danger my life was pre-served; none of us were seriously injured. When 9 years ^old^ I climbed into an elm tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a dry limb, which broke and I fell about 15 feet upon my back which beat the breath out of my body, a cousin ran and told my parents I was dead; before they arrived at the spot, I came to my senses and met my parents ^them^ coming to me. When 12 years of age I was drownd in Farmington Rriver, and sunk in 30 ft of water, and after carrying one person to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved by a young man named Bacon by diving to the bottom, and carrying with him a large stone, to holld hold him down until he obtained my body, not expecting to save my life ^me alive^: I suffered much in being restored to life: ^at 13 years of age^ While passing through Farmington meadows, in the depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow, and in an exceedingly blustering day I became so chilled and 
 subjects, although I never made an ^outward^ profession until 1830; I did not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordinances and gifts which the Apostles taught.  Although the ministers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles ^& ordinances,^ which the ancient saints enjoyed were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe a word ofit, to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief ofthe children of men; I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another,when God had a church upon the earth, & I believed ^that^ the church of God would be ^re-^established upon the earth, in my and that I should live to see it.  Thies^e^ principles was^ere^ rivetted upon my mind from two causes; first, from the perusal of the old and new Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord for the space of three years taught me in accordance with the written word of God that He was about to set up His church and kingdom upon the earth in the last days. / and secondly, I was taught thies^e^ principle ^things^ from my youth by Robert Mason, an aged man,who lived in Simsbury, Conn.; who was frequently called the old prophet Mason,: he taught me many things which are nowcoming to pass. / heHe did not believe that any person man upon theface of the earth had authority to administer in the ordinancesof the Gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer and fasting to heal the sick, and cast out Devils by the laying on of hands, which was the case under his administration as many could testify.I was looking for the coming forth of the truth when Iheard of what was called Mormonism.  In 1832 I was inspired to go to Rhode Island, an my brother, Asahel, wasalso directed by the spirit of God to go to the same place 
 when we met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us to wonder and marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we had made preparations to move to the West, we let outward circumstances control us,and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went to Richland, Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until the 29th day of Dec., ^29,^ 1833, before ^when^ I heard Elder Zerah Pulsiper and Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Azmon and I believed their testimony, and invited ^entertained^ the Elders home and offered our-selves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the book of Mormon and I received a testimony that it was true.I learned that Elders Sam. H. Smith and Orson Hyde werehad preached in Rhode island in 1832, which accounted for thereason We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, for at the time we were warned of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter day Saints were preaching there,and had we gone, we certainly should have embraced the work at that time, but as it was we had to wait forthe next call.Dec. 31, I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; and ^he^ confirmed ^me^ the same evening.Jan. 2, 1834 I was ordained to the office of a Teacher,and my Eldest brother, Azmon, an Elder, and a small branch organized of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher. In Feby. following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the town of Fabius to attend an evening meeting of the saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding; I saw the book of commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith, and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein, and after spending several days with them, and holding several meetings, we returned home rejoicing. Â¶ During the winter, we were visited by several of the Elders among whom was Elder Harry Brown; He again who calledupon us again about Feby 1st, accompanied by Elder Parley P. Pratt called upon us and instructed the branch, he spoke till near midnight 
 overcome with cold, ^so that^ I could not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a large apple tree a man in the distance seeing me go into ^it^ the tree hastened to my rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I didwhen he arrived at the spot I had fallen asleep and was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sense of my situation, he procured means to carry me to my father's house, and through a kind providence my life was again preserved. At 14 years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly through my foot; and it was 9 months getting well. At 15 year of age, I was bitten in my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he only dented my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood & I was again preserved through the mercies of God from an awful death. At the age of 17, I metwith an accident which caused me much sufferingand came near ending my life, I was riding a very ill tempered horse, which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep ^rocky^ hill, the horse took the ^taking^ advantage of the ground, suddenly leaped from the ground ^road^, and ran down the steepest part of it ^the hill^, amid the roughest of the rocks at full speed, and commenced kicking up at the same time, and attempted to throw me over his head upon the rocks, but I lodged upon the top of his head grasped hold of each ear, as with a death grasp, expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces among ^against^ the rocks, while in this position sitting astride of his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under full speed until he ran against a rock, which ^and^dashed him to the ground. I went over both his head on and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground square on my feet, being the only thing visible that 
 saved my life, for had I struck upon any other part of my body, it must have killed me instantly, as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds, it broke my left leg twice in two places and put out both my ankles in a shocking mannerand the Horse came near rolling over me in his struggles to get up; my uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw me fall got assistance me and carried me to his houseI lay from 2 O'clock ^pm^ till 10 at night without medical aid then my Father arrived bringing Dr Swift of Farmington with him who set my bones boxed up my limbs and carried me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my fathers;my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention and in 8 weeks I was out doors upon my crutches. In 1827 while attempting to clear the ice out of a water wheel; standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft; a man hoisted the gate and let a full head of water upon it, as soon as the water struck the wheel it ^the wheel^ it started, my feet slipped into the wheel I immediately plunged head long foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to death. In 1831 while having charge of the flouring mill in Collinsville Ct. I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 ft. in diameter, upon one of the arms near the top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water was let on to it, it immediately started; but I droped my ax and leaped through the wheel to the bottom of it, by the shaft and arms about 20 feet: as I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone wall with only about 2 feet of water clearance between it and the wheel, the wheel caught me and rolled me out into the water below where I found myself with-out any bones broken, but with some bruses and much fright. 
 Chapter 1; My missions to Fox IslandsMy Travels through Canada and visitto my parents in Connecticut while on my journeyHaving returned from my Southern Mission in thefall of 1836, in company with A. O. Smoot& Jesse Turpit, I spent the winter in of 1835,,in Kirtland, received my Endowments, and attended theschool taught by profeser Haws who taught GreekLatten & English Gramer, I confined myself mostlyto Lattin & English Gramer. This Winter & Springin some respects was one of the most interesting inthe History of the Church considering the Endowments &teachings given and the Apostisy which followedI was Married to Miss Phebe Whittemore Carteron the 13 Day of April 1837, I received my patri-archal Blessing under the hands of president JosephSmith the patriach on the 15 day of April 1837I felt impressed ^By the spirit of God^ to take a Mission to FoxIslands, on the East of Maine a country I knewnothing about I made my feelings known tosome of the leading Apostles and they advised meto go, so on the 
 : we had a precious time. He was upon an important mission togather up a company to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied brotherPratt to Jefferson Co., ^&^ I told him my circumstances; he said it was myduty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and join the camp of Zion.I immediately went to work with all my might and settledmy business. Â¶ April 11, 1834, I ^with my^ biad^e^ my friends farewell, and took a pairof horses and wagon, and took with me ^I took^ brothers Harry Brown andWarren Ingales, and started for Kirtland, Ohio ^Zion^. I met with Orson Pratt,John Murdoch and other Elders on the way and arrived in Kirtlandon the 25th day of April 1834.I was introduced to The prophet Joseph, who invited meto make his house my home; which kind offer I accepted, ^his offer^ and staidwith him about one week. I became acquainted not only with theprophet Joseph, and his family but / with ^stet^ many of the High PriestsElders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard manyof the Elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light andknowledge which was manifested to me during that day.May 1, I started from Kirtland, and went to New Portage,and remained till all the company joined us, when we were organized.^Â¶^ March 7, we took up our line of march, pitching our tents by theway, and travelled to Missouri.After we had pitched our tents in Clay Co. (our numbers being205) and many of the brethren had been taken sick, and some haddied, Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except enough to take careof the sick; all who had teams were required to leave the groundgo among the brethren, I went to bro. Lyman Wights', in companywith Heman Hyde and Milton Holmes. After Shortly, Joseph calledthe brethren together at Lyman Wights', and told them if they wouldhumble themselves before the Lord, and covenant to keep His command-ments and obey His counsel, the plague should be stayed from thathour, and there should not be another case of the cholera in thecamp. The brethren commanded covenanted to do this and theplague was stayed and there was not another case in camp.Prest. Joseph Smith returned home ^to Kirtland^ with many other of the brethren, I remained with Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till the 
 During the winter of 1831, while in New hartford, Ct. I passed through a severe fit of sickness course of lung fever. In 1833, the day I was baptized into the churchof Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints; one of my horses, newly caught ^sharp shod^, kicked my hat off my head and had he struck 2 inches lower, would probably have killed me instantly, in 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same team down a hill on a sleigh without any box the bottom boards slipped forward under the roller and caught the ground, turned end ways and fell on the horses' backs, ^throwing me between^ between the horses, they ran to the bottom of the hill dragging me by ^with^ the lines, head foremost with the sleigh on top of me about 20 rods over a smooth snow path, I escaped unharmed however, in the midst of both dangers. In 1834 while traveling in Zion's camp in Mo. a rifle was accidentally discharged and the ball passed through 3 tents with about 12 men in each, and lodged in a wagon axletree while a man was standing behind it, it ^and^ injured no one ^it^ passed within a few inches of my breast, and many others escaped as narrowly as myself: a few months afterwards a musket heavily loaded with buckshot was accidentlally snapped with the muzzle pointed at my breast within a fewfew feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot, it had a good flint and ^was^ well primed, but it missed fire and my life was a gain preserved. In April 1839 in Rochester Ills. I was riding upon the running gears of a wagon without a box, I was sitting upon the forward axletree, the bolt came out, fastening the copuling pole, which left the hind wheels, and my weight on the forward bolster and tongueturned the copuling pole, clear over onto the horses backs, turned the stakes upside down 
 The ^W. Woodruffs^ Englands Missions of 1840Joseph Smith the prophet asked the Lord what his will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord answered in a revelation given July 8, 1838in which the Lord says Let them take leave of my Saints in the City Far West on the 26 day of April next on the building spot of my Home saith the Lord, Let my servant John Taylor and also my servant John E Page and also my servant Wilford Woodruff and also my servant Willard patriarch be appointed to fillthe places of those who have fallen and be officially notified of their Appointment.It will be observed that different from nearly all other revelations in the instant a day & datewas given and place was given for the commencment of this Mission and when this revelation was given all was peace & quiet And in Missouri & at Far West but before the time being for the fulfillmentof that revelation The Saints of God had been driven out of the State of Missouri into Illinois under 
 following winter.I had a great desire to t^pr^each the Gospel, which I did notreveal  to any person ^name to my brethren^, but one Sunday evening I retired into the woodsalone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to open my wayto go and preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of the Earth; thespirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness unto me that my prayer was heard, and should be answered. I walkedarose from my knees happy, and walked some forty rods through athick wood into an open road, as I entered the road, there stood before^&^ me^t^ Elias Higbee, a high priest, with whom I had staid for a numberof months, but had never said any thing to me about preaching orordination, but now as I appouched^roached^ him, he said "bro. Wilford thespirit of the Lord tells me that you should be ordained andgo on a mission." I replied, "I am ready."At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wight's, Clay Co., Mo. on Nov. 5, I was ordained a priest ^by Elder^ under the hands of  bros. Samuel^imeon^ Carter; Stephen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde, were ^also^ ordainedPriests at the same time.Bishop Partridge said he would like to have me go intothe Southern States, through Arkansas, Tennessee & Kentucky, &c. ^&^ if I couldfind any body who had faith enough to go with me ^to take^ for it wouldbe a dangerous count^r^y to travel in at present, in consequence of the Missouri persecution, ^to take him.^ I told him I was as ready to go South as anywhere, and asked if I should go through Jackson County, as it lay directon our route, he said ^replied^, it would be at the risk of life, and hehad not got faith enough to undertake it; if I had, I mighttry it. I also asked him, if I went through Jackson Co., if Ishould start without purse or scrip according to the law of God,Hee he replied answered, that he had not got faith enough to starton a mission through Jackson Co., without money, and if I did itI must do it on my own faith, I felt strenuous to keep thecommandments, so I started without money; I called upon Elder HarryBrown, and asked him if he would not ^to^ accompany me; it met ^he consented,^his wishes, and Bishop Partridge gave appointed him to go with meJan. 13, 1835, I received an honorable discharge from Lyman 
 and shut me up fast, ^between the bolster and tongue^ but in such a manner that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground my horses took fright and ran out into an open prairie and thus dragged me in this possession ^position^ for about half a mile. I managed to guide them with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner ^of a high worm^of the fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was considerably bruised but escaped without any broken bones. On the 23rd July 1842 Prest Joseph Smith sent me to S from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat was 6 days on the way, during which time I was severely attacked with billious fever. The day I made my purchase, the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible of what I was doing, as soon as I made my purchase, and got my freight on board, I took my birth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo, whichwas on the 10 of Aug.st. I was confined to my bed 40 days and passed through the most severe fit of sickness I ever endured, my life was dispaired of by many of my friends; I was administered to by Prst Smith and the Twelve: my life was preserved by the power of God. I took a relapse twice after I began to recover, once while in council with the Presidency & Twelve, my strengths left me my breath stoped and I felt as though I was struck with death. On the 12th Sept 12, 1843 I left At 5 o'clock p.m. I left Boston, on the express train for Portlandwhile passing through Chester woods 6 miles south [of] Kennebunk some person having pried up ^raised^ the ^one of the^ railsand put under them ^rolled^  a log, ^under it^ and it being darkthe we struck it at full speed and landed ina pile of ruins. 3 cars were filled with passengers 
 The time having arrived for me to start onmy mission I did not tary at home one yearaccording to the Law of Moses after having marriedme a wife I ownly tarried one Month & 18 days and on the 3rd May 1837, I took the parting hand withmy wife whom I left at with Sister Hale, where shewas expecting to tary for the season.

 under the Edict of Gov Boggs and the Missourianshad sworn that if all the other revelations of Joseph Smith were fulfilled that should not beas it had a day & date to it and they would seethat it should not be fulfilled. It almost seemedas though the Lord having a foreknowledge of whatwould take place had placed a day & date tothat revelation to see whether the Apostles wouldobey that revelation at the risk of their liveswhen the time drew near for the fulfillment ofthis commandment of the Lord Brigham Youngbeing then president of the Twelve (As Thomas B.Marsh had fallen) He called the Twelve together into[illegible] then at Quency Illinois to see what ourMinds would be about going to Far West tofulfill the revelation Father Joseph Smith thepatriarch and others who were present did notthink it wisdom for us to attempt it as ourlives would be at stake and thought the Lordwould take the will for the deed But whenpresident Young asked the Twelve what their feelingswere upon the sub[ject] [page torn] We all of us as in the voice

We bent our way south, through Jackson Co., withoutany harm molestation; yet, in one instance, we were miraculouslypreserved from a mob of about 60, assembled at a grog shop,which we had to pass.June 18, we called at the Harmony mission and had aninterview with the President, a Presbyterian minister; althoug^h it^ was nearsun down he would neither give us any thing to eat, nor lodge us,because we were Mormons, it was 15 miles to the nearest house,which was Jerrews Indian tready trading house; we asked theminister to direct us there; he gave us directions, but the spiritsaid to me, he was deceiving us, I asked him three times, andhe declared he was telling us the truth. ) We followed his directionsand we arrived ^came^ at ^to^ the Osage river swamp, where we were lostin the darkness of the night; we followed the river, but as it isone of the most ^very^ crooked in America, we made ^but^ little progress. Aftertravelling through mud and and water for one hour, we concludedto go out on the open prairie and lie down in the grass untilmorning, but when we got out into the prairie we heard theOsage Indians drum and shout at the trading house as they werehaving a Pow-wow, we followed by the sound and went intotheir midst; As we approached, we were met by a dozen largesavage looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly manner, butdid not attempt to bite nor bark; we arrived about midnight,covered with mud, hungry and weary, and were kindly received 
 Joseph Smith presided at a Conference held at Quincy Ill on the 6th May 1839 where it was resolved that 15 of the Seventies Names given also 5 High priest accompanythe Twelve to Europe only two out of the Twenty fulfilled the mission. May 9th Joseph Smith left Quincy with his family for Commerce Ill. on the 9 May and arrived on the 10th & sleped with his family in a log home nearly all of the Churchwho were driven from Missouri soon followed the prophet to Commerce, Ill. On the 9 11 June Joseph Smith commenced dictating his History to his Clerks, who wrote for him. On the 15 May 1839 I left Quincy Ill. and started with my family for Commerce Ill I ownly droveto the Committee House & spent the night. 16th Brother Brigham Young & myself started with our families & drove 15 miles & camped for the night, and on the night of the 17th, wecamped on the bottom of an open prairie. We arrrived inCommerce on the 18th, and called upon Brother Joseph Smith & his family. I also say many other old friends who had been driven from place to place yet th[e]y felt well, & were not discouraged but felt to trust in God. The Saints felt determined to ^try to^ buildup a City wherever they went, Commerce was beautifulfor situations yet there was but two or three buildingsin the town. After spending a short time visiting old acquaintances I crossed the Mississippi River in a ferry boat and landed in Montrose Iowa. This was the first time I ever was in the Terr[i]tory.Montrose was built for a garrison in 1834 by theUnited States Army. It contained about  12 blocks ofbuildings making about 75 rooms in all. After spendingthe night in Doctor Gallands office, I moved my family and effects into a room on the west side of the publicsquare. This room I occupied untill I started upon my mission for England and my family occupied itafter my departure 
 and their lives were saved, by having a long train of freight between the passenger cars and the engine, which ^all of them^ were mashed to pieces, the engineer was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken I escaped unhurt. On the 5th day of Oct 1846, while with the Camp of Israel building up winter quarters on the west side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country,) I passed through one of the most painful and serious misfortunes I ever of any of my life I took my axe and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs, to cut some shingle timber to cover my shanty cabin I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the 3rd trees ^was falling^ which was an oak over 2 ft diameter I stepped behind it some 10 feet, and also to one side the same distance, where I thought I was entirely out of danger, but when the tree fell there being a crook in the body of it, ^which^ struck a knoll on the ground when the whole body shot endways back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on the breast, and knocked me several feet into the air, ^against a standing oak^ and the falling tree followed me in its bound and caught me against the standing tree and I came down between the them, before reaching the ground I was liberated from them and struck the ground upon my feet, badly bru^i^sed my left thigh the whole length of it and my hip also ^and^ my left arm, it also broke my breast bone also 3 ribs on my left side also bruised my lungs, vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. after the accident I sat upon a log until MrMo Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse; notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had 
 of one man said the Lord God had spoken andit was for us to obey, It was the Lords businessto take care of his saints and we wouldfulfull the commandment or die a trying. Accordingto our revalation on the 18 April 1839 Itook into my waggon Brigham Young & OrsonPratt and Father Cutler took into his waggonGeorge A Smith & John Taylor & George A SmithOn the way we overtook John E Page who wason his way with his family to Quincy Ill Hiswaggon had turned over and when we met himhe was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soapwith his hands, we helped him right up hiswaggon he drove down into the vally belowand accompanied us on to far west. On thenight of 25 April we arived at Far West and spentthe night at the Home of Morris Phelps who wasstill in prison On the morning of the 26 April1839, Notwithstanding the threats of our Enemiesthat the revelation that was to be fulfilled thisday should not be and Notwithstanding thatten thousands of the saints had been driven out ofthe state by the edict of the Governor 
 and entertained for the remainder of the night by Mr. Jerrew,who had an Osage squaw for a wife; she prepared us a goodsupper, but marvelled that we did not drink coffee; she pro-ffered us their best bed, which was highly ornamented, but we de-clined ^ her accepting her kind offer, as we were wet and muddy;she then made us a good bed of Mackinaw blankets before alarge fire, and we slept comfortably. May the Lord rewardboth Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Presbyterian minister accord-ing to their deserts.19th, Mr. Jerreu gave us a good breakfast, put us accrossthe Osage river in a canoe, and was we started upon our longday's walk, it being 60 miles to the nearest house; and we had nota morsel of anything with us to eat; most of our travels throughthe day was through prairie; before dark we entered timbered land,as we approached the timber a large black bear met us; wehad no weapons^.^ but a small pistol, when the bear got ^within^ about6 rods of us, he rose upon his hind feet and examined usa short time, then turned and went another off. We weresoon enveloped in such thick darkness ^that^ it was with great difficultythat we could keep the road, we ^&^ were soon surrounded with ^by^a large drove of wolves, that ^which^ kept up a continual howling, andwould frequently rush upon us, coming to within a few feetof us, we travelled about two hours in this situation, feeling thatwe were in danger, and concluded to stop and build a fireand wait till morning; accordingly we built a large fire whichdrove the wolves off, and as we were about to lie down, we hearda dog bark and a bell; we felt assured we were near ahouse; each both of us took a brand of fire, and on goingabout one quarter of a mile, we came to a log hut, which wasoccupied by Mr. Williams, who had been in Jackson Co., duringthe mobing of the Saints;, he ^&^ had lately moved here dependingupon his gun mostly for his living, it was 60 miles to a house on the North and 12 miles on the South; him ^He^ and hisfamily were living in a small old log hut, about 12 feet square,and one bed in the room, upon which lay his wife, several children

We spoke to the people several times during theconference. At the close of the conference we were calledupon to administer to a woman who was possessedwith the Devil she at times was dumb & greatlyafflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in herShe believed in Jesus of Nazareth and in us as hisservents, and wished us to administer to herfour of us laid hands upon her head andcommanded the Devil in the Name of Jesus Christto come ^depart^ out of her, and it was immediately doneand the woman arose with great joy and gave thanks and praise unto God for according to her faith shewas made whole from that hour, a childalso that was sick was made whole by the laying onof hands according to the word of God see ##Mark 16:17|Mark 16 ch 17.##we walked 30 miles to visit another Branch of the Saints at Leeds where we met with John Goodson& John Snider. We held meetings & bore our testimonythe to the people.

C. Kimball& W. Richards and others who assisted in carryingme to ^my^ family; before laying me upon my bed, thePresidency laid hands upon me rebuked mysuffering and distress in the name of theLord, and said I should live and not die, I was then laid upon my bed in my wagonand as the Apostles prophesied upon my headso it came to pass. I did live and not die. I employed no physician on this occasion butwas administered to by the Elders of Israeland nursed by my Wife. I lay upon my bedunable to move, until my breast bone beganto knit together, which commenced on the 9thday, I began to walk about in 20 days in30 days from the time I was hurt, I againcommenced to do hard labor.On the 21st day of April 1856, I innoculatedmy arms with poison and mortification ^ensued^; whileassisting to remove an ox that had died frompoison and had been skinned; the poison workedthrough my system for seven days before itshowed itself outwardly. on the 28 my arm began to swell, was in great pain and showed signs

 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having beensick for several days, & his home & door yard containg manyof the sick saints who had been driven from Missouri. Josephrose from his bed with the power of God resting upon himand he took the sick by the hand & in a loud voicecommanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ toarise & be made whole & he healed all that werein his house & around about he then took someof the Twelve with him & walked up the River bankabout a mile & healing all that were sick as he wentalong & they were many among the number was ElderSherwood who lay at the point of death. He crossedthe River to Montrose went into the home where BrighamYoung lay sick & healed him, who walked out of thehome & followed him. The prophet came to where I was standing & told me to follow him I did so wethen went into the home of Elijah Fordham whowas at the point of death, his friends had lookedfor him to breath his last for several hours, hehad lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walkedinto the room Brother The Joseph took brotherFordham by the hand & looking the dying man inthe eyes for several moments. He then said Brother Fordhamin the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comandyou to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophetwas like the voice of God it seemed as though the wholehome shook from its very foundation. And the manleaped from his bed & was made whole instaneouslyHe kicked his poltices off from his feet, dressed himselfeat a boll of bread & milk & followed us out of the houseI went into the House of Bates Nobles who was alsovery sick the prophet healed him & we knelt down & prayed& gave thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeingthe power of God and followed to see what the end wouldbe. After the prophet had healed, all the sick saints inMontrose he with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 and three young dogs, he lay stretched out upon the barefloor with his feet to a small fire, there was no door to thehouse, but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way; it was past 11 o'clock at night. I turned away the quilt, looked intothe house, every thing was in sound sleep,  I ^&^ spoke threetimes; no one stirred, not even a dog. I walked in and laidmy hands upon the man's shoulders, and spoke to him; the momenthe felt the weight of my hand, he leaped to his feet, and commencedrunning around the room, leaping as high as he could each jump.I told him not to be frightened, as we were travellers and friendsand did not wish to hurt him, but wished to stop with himover night; when he came to his senses, he gave us permission tostop with him till morning, if we would take the bare floor,as he did, we asked for something to eat, as we had walked 60miles without a morsel of food; he replied, he had nothing for us,and assured us he had to kill game for his breakfast in themorning. He informed us that the reason of his fright, was ^ in consequence of his having shot a large panther dead a few nightsprevious standing in his door, and he thought his mate hadlit upon him. We lay down upon the floor, and we wereglad of this place as it soon began to rain, and rainedthrough the night.In the morning we arose, and went on in the rain 12miles to a Mr. Conner's, who was also in the Jackson county mob;he gave us breakfast, but damned us while we were eating becausewe were Mormons, when we had finished f a hearty breakfast, we thankedhim very politely, and went on our way leaving him swearing; wefelt thankful for breakfast, for we had walked 72 miles withouteating food. We continued travelging, preaching by the way, without ^taught from house to house^ stopping, only over night. as we journeyed.Jan. 24, I preached at Mr. Nathan Tanner's in Green Co.Missouri, the first time we had found a congregation during ourjourney, that we could converse, and preach to, in safety, and the firsttime that I had ever attempted to preach ^as a missionary.^ to a congregation in thecapacity of a Priest or missionary, I had great liberty and was 
 the Elders who laid their hands upon it and it was healed & I presented it whole to its Mother. It was healedby the power of God in the name of Jesus both childrenwere healed and the parents prasied God for his goodfgoodness. After leaving the Saints in this place we returnedto Kingston crossed Lake Ontario in company with IsaacRussell ^John Goodson & John Snider^ who seemed constantly trouble with evilspirits Broth Russell These three Brethren continued withus to Schenectady where they parted with us to go to New York to join Elders Heber C Kimball & Orson Hydeon their mission to England to preach the GospelAfter leaving these Brethren we traveled by road toAbbey and walked from there to Canaan Conn wharewe found a Branch of the Church including Jesse & JulianMoses & Francis ^K^ Benedict. We held a ^2 days^ Conference withthe Saints in Canaan I ordained Julian Moses & Francis K Benedict Elders. After holding several Meetings in the Town of Colebrook and visiting my half sisterEunice Woodruff who was teaching school ^on the 6 July^ I visited AvonAvon the place of my birth I visited many of myformer Neighbors & relatives and the Grave of my Mother Bulah Woofruff the Daughter of LotThompson who died June 11, 1808 aged 26 yearsThe following vers was upon her tomb stone 
 Darwins Chase and Norman Shearer (who had just been liberated from Richmond prison) were also ordained to the office of Seventies. The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer in the following order Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, Orson Pratt John E Page John Taylor Wilford Woodruff and George A SmithAfter which they sung Adam^on^di Aman and then the Twelve took their leave and parting hand of the following Saints agreeable to revelation viz A Brother Elias Smith, Norman Shearer, Wm Burton, Stephen Pecke, Artemusia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah GrangerTheodore Turley, Hiram Clark, & Daniel Shearer,Then we took the parting hand of this small remnant of Saints who remained on the Temple ground to see us fulfill this revelation of God and commandment of God, and turned our back upon Far West and Missouriand returned to Illinois, and we accomplished this mis-sion without a dog to move his tongue on any man to say why do you so. We reached Quincy crossed the Mississippi river on the steem ferry & entered Quincy on the 2nd day of May and we all had the joy of receiving our families once more in peace & safety un There was an incident unaccounted with our journey well worthy of recordthat while we were on our journey to fulfill the revelation Joseph the prophet & his companions in chains had got 
 of mortification I showed it to Prest. Young who advisedme to cleanse my stomach immediately and puton onion poultices and any thing that would drawthe poison from my system into my arm, whichI counsel I immediately put into execution. the29th was another trying day to my life, the poisonhad so thoroughly penetrated my whole system thatmy strength left me I could not stand, I was ledto my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased toact, my speech was like that of a drunken manPrest. Young called into company with Dr Spragueand laid hands upon me and rebuked the diseaseand the power of the distroyer which had sceizedmy body and promised me in the name of theLord, that I should not die but live to finishedmy work which was appointed me, upon theEarth. I soon began to recover; the poison andmortification left my body system and centeredin my arm, and was drawn from my armthrough the aid of charcoal poultices, moistenedwith a strong decoction of wormwood rag weedand wild sage; the dead flesh was removedfrom my arm with instruments and lunar causticand in a few days I was well again.I have occupied considerable space in referingto those peculiar circumstances, which have attendedme during life, and to sum the matter up, it standsthus: I have broken both legs, one twice in two ^in two places^, botharms, both ankles, ^dislocated^ my breast bone and three ribs, ^and ^had^ both ankles dislocated^I have been drown^e^d, froze, scalded, and bit bya mad dog; have been in two water wheels underfull head of water; have passed through severalsevere fits of sickness; & encountered poison in itsworst forms; have landed in a pile of rail-road ruins 
 followed by Elder Brown: during our preaching there was a hard snow storm.We arrived at Petty John Creek, in the Arkansas Territory, where Mr. Alexander Akeman resided with a large family of sons and onedaughter, all of which who^m^ were settled around him, Mr Akeman, ^stet^ was amember of the church ^he^ and a part of his family, were members of the church in Jackson Co.; his wife died strong in the faith in Mo.; & his whole family were mobbed, and some of his sons were whipped severely; but he could not stand the persecution and the loss of his property,he moved to Arkansas to get rid of Mormonism, had apostatized, and was bitter against the work; when we called upon him, he opposed us strongly, â€” spoke against the leaders of the church and the book of Mormon, he had one son who received us, and had a little faith, I had a ^the following^ dreamed the night before I ^we^ went there. concerning what we shouldmeet with, and what would transpire. " I dreamed that we were re-quired to walk in a strai^gh^t narrow path, and while following the path it lead to the door of a house, which was placed in a high wall which ^that^ we could not get around; as I opened the door to go through, I saw theroom ^was^ filled with ^large serpents.^ snakes, I proceeded ^entered,^ and they all coiled up to jump at me; as they made a spring to bite me, they all fell dead at my feet, turned black, swelled up, burst open, took fire and were consumed before my eyes.We met with much opposition not only by ^from^ Mr. Akeman but from ^&^ many in the neighborhood, Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately; I told him I should stay and see my dream fulfilled. We staid in the neighborhood 25 days, during which time,the Lord brought judgment upon those who threatened to mob ^& kill^ us; many of them died suddenly, while we were there, and I was warned three times by the Lord to go to Mr. Akeman and bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism and the wickedness of his course in opposing it, and the last time I called upon him he was filled with wrath against me, and when I left his house he followed me in a rage, apparently with some evil intent; when I had got a few rods from his door, he was nearly treading on my heels, he ^&^ fell dead at my feet, as though he had been struck with 
 A Pleasing Form, a generous gentle heartA good companion just without artJust in her dealings, faithful to her friendBeloved through Life, lamented in the endAt the close of the day I walked 6 milesto Farmington where my Father Aphek Woodruffwas living, and I had the happy privilege ofon[c]e more meeting with my Father & Step Motherwhich I had not seen for some seven years theyreceived me with great kindness and it was a happymeeting. After visiting my Father a day or two Ireturned to Avon where most of our relatives livedlived and held meetings with them and onthe 12 July 1837, I baptized my Uncle Ozem Woodruff& his wife Hannah, & his son John and we rejoicedtogether for this was in fulfillment of a dream Ihad in 1818 when I was eleven years of ageWe all rejoiced together. On the 15 July I had anapointment to preach at my Uncle Adna Hartswhile there I had the happy privilege of meetingwith my wife Phebe W Woodruff who hadhad come from Kirtland to meet me & accompany 
 The Testimony of Wilford WoodruffBefore closing this little book as a reader for ourChildren, I wish to bare my testimony toupon several principles to the Latter Day Saintsespecially to the rising Generation, the young men ofIsrael. First I wish to speak of the spiritsof good & evil the Lord says whatsoever leads to do good is of God & whater leads to do evil isof the Devil, this is a very important subject for us to understand the scriptures again tell usthat there is many spirits gone out into theworld and we should try the spirits to know whatis of God & what is of the world only. The new testamentsays that ery spirit that confesseth that Jesus is the Christis born of God, & ery spirit that denyeth that Jesus is the Christ is of AntiChrist & is not of God, I will also addthat evry spirit that confesseth that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, & that the Book of Mormon, Bible & Doctrine& Covenants are true is of God, and ery spirit that denithethdenieth this is not of God but is of the evil one I wish here to ask our friends the question as well as older 
 have barely been missed a ^the^ passing bullet, andhave passed through a score of other hair-breadthescapes. It has appeared miraculous to me, thatwith all the injuries and broken bones, whichI have met with ^had^; I have not a lame limb aboutme, but have been enabled to endure the hardestlabor, exposures and journeys, have oftenwalked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in aday. The protection and mercy of God has beenover me and my life thus far has been preservedfor which blessings I feel to render the gratitudeof my heart to my Heavenly Father; prayingthat the remainder of my days may bespent in his service and in the building upof his Kingdom. 
 liberated through the blessings of God from his enemies & prison and passed us not far distant from eachother without either party knowing it, they making their way for their families in Illinois while we were making our way to Far West into the hands ^midst^ of our enemies so they arrived home to their families & friends before our return. May 3rd was a very interesting day to me as well as others. In company with 5five others of the Quorum of the Twelve we rode four miles out of town to Mr Clevelands to visit Br Joseph Smith & his family we arrived at his home & once more had the happy privelege of taking Br Joseph by the hand two years had rolled away since I had seen his face.He greeted us with great joy as did Hyrum and Lyman Wight all of whom had escaped their imprisonment to gether they had been confined in prison six months and been under sentence of death three times, but yettheir lives were in the hands of God and He haddelivered them and they were now mingling with their wives children & friends and out of the reach of the mob and Joseph was frank open and familiar in â—Šâ—Šâ—Šd our rejoicing was great. No man can comprehend feel, sens or understand the joy or sensation that is created by such a meeting 
 lightning; he swelled & ^immediately^ turned black; this created a great wailing and mourning among his family. Brother Brown and myself assisted in laying him out, and burying him; he died Feby. 14th, 1835, and we buried him on the 16th.,This singular dispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people, and they began to reflect and wished to hearepreaching; we held several meetings and preached to the people, andbaptized Mr. Hubbel and his wife, aged people ^persons^, who had opened their doors, and given us a home; and just as we had got the people prepared to receive the Gospel, and anxious to learn and pleading with us to stay and preach, bro. Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south.  I was fully satisfied that should we stop, we wouldbuild up a church, and was convinced it was our duty to stop but bro. Brown held the office of an Elder ^& I submitted^ and I was a Priest, we were travelling together upon a mission, and I felt that I must be subject to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.This is an error which many have committed in this church who were sent as Missionaries to the world, as soon as they got doorsopen and a people prepared to receive the Gospel, they go away and leave them: we left this people with tears in their eyes. Brother Brown did not baptize another person ^on the mission^ during his whole southernmission.March 2, we cut down a large cotton wood tree, and ^in â—Š two days^ dug out a canoe 4 feet wide & 12 feet long, put on a pair of oars and ^then^ roweddown the Arkansas river, 125 miles, to little Rock, begging our food by the way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity; after visiting little Rock we travelled down the river 10 miles, and tied up our canoe on the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones, I preached next day at his house. On the 16th, we left our canoe with Mr. Jones and walked back up the river 10 miles, opposite little Rock, and took the old military road, and started to wade the Mississippi swamp which was mostly covered with water from little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles. We waded through mud and water knee deep, day after day, and in some instances 40 miles per day,before we could get a stopping place. 
 August 1832 a continuance of the foreerding subjectI have hastily noticed in the foregoing pages some of the leading circumstancesof my life, up to the time of my entering the ranks of the Servants of God. In looking it over I find many imperfections but as it was writtensome time since and in great haste I shall let it remain for thepresent and continue my narrative begginning where Ileft off When I entered the ranks of Gods people and first commencedthe Christians warfare I had but faint ideas of the narrownessof that Way, and but little realized that it was as strait away as the scriptures represent it to be, that but few shouldfind & walk in it. Much less did I in my weakness conceivethe many artful & cunning devices of Satan to draw thechild of God from the paths of holiness I had not yet learntby experience that the Devil like a roaring Lion goeth aboutseeking whom he may devour and that he grasps with hisdeadly claws every one that turns aside from the Highwayof Holiness. But as I turned and set my face Zion ward andbegan to take up my march thither I soon began to hearthe â€” at first but whispered suggestions of the Adversary trying towin me back to his service and I soon began to feel his fireydarts levelled and hurled at me from almost every quarterI soon found that I had enlisted as a Soldier in a warfareand that I must act not only the offensive but likewisethe defensive part and if I would gain the prize I mustfight. But I had yet (as a raw undiciplined recruit) to learn theuse of the armour with which Christians fight their battlesand from whom I could expect help from troubleI could not wield with ease the Sword of the Spirit and theShield of Faith though a comfortable garment ^& armour^, did not fitmy body Shapen and conceive in Sin, in fine the garmentsof Salvation could not be expected to fit perfectly, and setwith ease on one who had so long been clothed with shameand clad with the filthy garments of UnrighteousnessBut I had yet to learn of My Captain, of Him who is meekand lowly some simple & humble lessons of Christianitybefore I could make much resistance with the enemyin case of an open attack. Encouraging thought thatthe Captain of our Salvation being in all points temptedas we are is able to succour those that are temptedand that he will with every temptation providea way for our escape 
 except those who have born the Holy priesthood and been in tribulation for the Gospel sake after spending the day together with returned to our families at night. On the day following May 4, we met in conference in Quincy The prophet Joseph presiding which caused great joy to all the Saints, much business was done on the 4, but on Sunday the 5 May Joseph Smith addressedthe assembly followed by Sidney Rigdon & the Twelve Apostles the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us and we had a glorious day.On the following day May 6, I met with the Seventies & we ordained 60 men into the Quorum of Elders & SeventiesBrother Joseph met with the Twelve, ^Bishops^ and Elders of Bishp ^Bishop^ Partridges Home, and there was a number with us who was wounded at Hauns Mill among the numberwas, Isaac Laney, who was in company with about Twenty others at the Mill. A large armed Mob ^fell upon^ and^them^ with rifles and other weapons and shot down 17 of the Brethren & wounded others Brother Laney fled from the scene but the[y] poured a shower of led after him which peirced his body through and through, He showed elevenball holes in his body, there were 27 in his shirt 7 in his pantaloons, and his coat litteraly cut to peaces one ball entered one arm pit & came out of the 
 me to her Fathers home in ScarboroMaine. Those who had assembled togetherto hear me speak were relatives, Neighbors,H former friends. After meeting we returned to Farmington to my Fathers home where Ispent the night with my Father Mother StepMother, Sister & wife Elder Hale was alsowith us, on the 19 July, Elder Hale left usto go to his friends in New Rowley Massand on the same evening I held a meeting in the Methodist meeting house in the Town ofFarmington I had a large congregationof citizens with whom I had been acquaintedfrom my youth up. My parents wife and sisterattended the meeting. The congregation seemedsatisfied with the doctrin I taught andthey requested me to hold another meeting, butI felt anxious to continue my journey and onthe 20 July I parted with my father Step Mother 
 On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an attackof the Rheumatizm and could not travel fast. My companion, bro. Brown, had got in a hurry, and wished to hasten to the Mississippi, close up his mission, take boat andreturn to his family in Kirtland, and as I could not travel as fast as he wished, we parted; he left me sitting on a log in the mud and water; I was lame and unable to walk, without food, and 12 miles from the nearest house on the road; he went out of sight in great haste; I then knelt down in the water and prayed to the Lord to heal me; the spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I was healed; the pain left me, I arose and went my way; whenever I met with one or more families I preached and bore testimony to them as I went along. ^Â¶^ I crossed the Mississippi river on theevening of the 27th, of March.I ^&^ staid at a public house kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson, I was suspected of being an imposter. Mr. Jackson believed I was one of Murrill's clan, who were then murdering and stealing N^n^egros; and to test me, he gathered together a large house full of the ^most^ wickedest,and most corrupt Gentlemen ^people^ in the city, and set me to preaching to them, to see whether I could preach or not.I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same company of men and women will ever meet together again for the same purpose; or to test for they would not like again to have their sins and abominations revealed to each other, as plainly and pointedlyas I told them that night, through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost:  they were glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms. I travelled from Memphis to middle Tennessee.April 4, I met with Elder Warren Parrish in Benton Co., Hime and David W. Patten had labored together through the winter in Tennessee, and baptized 20 persons. Elder Patten had returned to Kirtland.  I joined Elder Parrish and we labored together over 3 months, travelling and preaching daily, baptizing such as would receive our testimony, extending our labors through ^in^ Tennessee & Ken-tucky.June 23, we recieved a letter from Oliver Cowdery,  saying,that they wished ^requesting^ Elder Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for me to 
 one do you ever consider or contemplate any thingabout the number of evil spirits that occupy theEarth who are at war against God and Christ andthe saints of God and against all good & seek to destroyall the Children of men in ery age of the world, let usreason together a moment upon this subject, it maybe impossible for any man without derct revelation from God to get to know the exact number but wemay approximate to wards it. The Lord has said by revel-ation that Lucifer an Angel in authority rebelled againstGod & drew away one third part of the Hosts of heaven thatwere cast down to the Earth & the Heavens wept over him howmany were cast out of heaven down to the Earth We supposethat the inhabitants of heaven here refered to were the spiritsof our Father in heaven who were to come down to the Earth &tak[e] tabernacles on the Earth how many were there to comedown & take tabernacles this again may be sufficient to take yet perhaps we may come near enough for purposeit has generally been conceded that there is about 1000 000000one thousand Million on the earth at a time though the late statisticians make out fourteen hundred Million at the presenttime but we will say 1000 000 000 one thousand Milloin

My wifePhebe had been absent from her home about 
 other another entered his back and came out at the breast a ball passed through each hip each leg and each arm all this was while he was running for life and as strange as it may appear, all those wounds with one broaken rib did not lessen his speedbut he out run his enemies & carried his life we can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power and Mercy of God, president Joseph Young was also among the number He also fled although the balls flewaround him like lâ—Šâ—Šd yet he was not wounded How marvelous are the ways of the LordBefore starting upon our missions to England we were under the necessity of settling our families, And as a place called Commerceafterwards called Named Nauvoo was chosen for our people to settle I left Quincy in company with El Brother Brigham Young & ourfamilies on the 15 May and arrived in Commerceon the 18th and after an interview with Joseph we crossed the river into the old Military Barracksin Iowa, and there took up our alode abode for our Families, President Brigham Young and myself 
 remain and take charge of the Southern churches, and the Lord would bless me in so doing.June 28, Warren Parrish ordained me to the officeof an Elder, we baptized some 40 persons while laboring together.July 23, Elder Parrish returned to Kirtland ^left^.  I continuedto traveled alone through the year, and extended my labors both in Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptized 43 persons during this season, 31 after bro. Parrish left me. Nov. 15, while travelling in the night with severalbro. Benj. L. Clapp and others, a tremendous storm of wind and rain overtook us; we came to a creek which had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without swimming our horses; and several of the company were faemialies, and could not consistently cross the stream / we undertook to head the stream sufficient to ford it, but in the attempt in the midst of the darkness, and the raging of the wind and rain, we became ^were^lost in the thick woods,we had neither fire, light nor road, but were in the dark, mud, ^amidst the^ rain, wind, mud, creeks and ^fallen^ tree tops,we crossed streams near twenty times, and setting aside our femalesand horses we made more the appearance of fishermen than travellers. I was reminded of Pauls perils by water; but the Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were groping in the dark, running the risk of killing both ourselves and animals by riding off  steep ^precipitous^ bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone round about us, and revealed unto us our perilous situation, as we were upon the edge of a deep gulf; the light continued with us until we found a house and learned the right road, then the light disappeared, yet ^&^ we were enabled to reach the house of bro. Henry Thomas at 9 o'clock in the evening, without all safe, having rode 20 miles, being 5 hours inthe storm, and forded streams twenty or more times, and we felt to thank the Lord for our preservation.During the winter and spring, I continued to labor mostly alone, through Kentucky and Tennessee, and extended my laborsopening new places, preaching daily, baptizing, confirming and organ- 
 It is also said that a generation passes off ery 33 1/3 yearsmaking three generations in a century which would bethree thousand Million in one hundred years 3 times 10 is 30which would make thirty thousand Million in1000 years, 3 times 7 is 21, o which would make two hundred & ten thousand Millions, is, seven thousand years. The arguargument might be used that when Adam was createdthere was but /2/ on two on the earth and after the floodbut eight souls, but the probability is that during the Milleniumthe inhabitants will increase very fast as the age of the childrenwill be as the age of a tree, and the inhabitants of the Earthwill not die off as they do now. But we will suppose that therewas one hundred thousand Milloin fallen spirits cast down fromfrom heaven to earth, and that there was one thousand Millionof inhabitants upon the Earth to day that would make one ^one^ hundredevil spirits to each men, woman & child being on the Earthand the whole mission and labor of these spirits is to leadall the children of men to do evil & to destruction. Now I want all^of^ our boys & girls to reflect upon this, and to see what danger theyare in and the warefare they have to pass through, these hundred evil spirits^to each one of^ the children of men ^seak to^ and lead them into ery temptation possible to use tobaco, smoke drink whisky, get drunk, curse, sware, lie, steal& comit adultery & Murder & do evry evil thing possible to cutthem off from salvation as far as possible while on the other handthe spirit of God labors & strive to preserve all the children 
 from there evils, and the Lord has given his angels chargeconcering us, and they do all they can for our salvationbut yet we have all have our agency to chuse the good &refuse the evil, or chuse the evil & refuse the good. The Lordforces no man to heaven, neither does the Lord tempt anyman to do evil, when a man is tempted to do evil it isby the power of the Devil, who is an enemy to all rightousnessI feel very annxious to lure our boys & girls our young men andmaidens to seek for that which is good whenever you are temptedto do evil turn from it never make light of any of thecommandments or ordinances of the Gospel of Christ, and when youmeet with any company who do it shun their society avoid theuse of tobaco & strong drink for they lead to evil, you arelaying a foundation while in the days of your youth for acharacter which will decide your destiny through all timeand throughout all eternity either for Good or Evil. TheLord has told us by revelation "^see D&.C. sec 130^ that whatever knowledge  or principle of intelligens we attain to in this life it will risewith us in the resurrection, and any person who gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his dilligence & obediencethan another will have so much the advantage in the world to come"Therefore we should all strive to be diligent in obt[ain]ing intelligenceand bring to pass righteousness upon our agency & not wait tobe commanded in all things and great will be your reward forso doing 
 about one year I spent 8 days with FatherCarter & Household visiting the relatives & Saints inScarboro and one day I went out into the sea witha B Fabyan & Ezra Carter my Brothers in Law ina boat to fish with hooks we caught 250 CodHaddock & Hake and we saw four whales twoat at a time, the first ^time^ in my life that I hadever seen that kind of a fish that swallowdJonah. On the 18 August 1837, I parted withmy Wife and her Fathers household leaving herwith them, and in company with Johnathan HHale started upon my mission to that I hadin view when I left Fo Kirtland to visitFox Islands to preach the Gospel to the inhabitantsthereof. We walked 10 miles to portland & took thesteem boat Bangor which took us to Owls Headwhere we went on board of a sloop which landed uson North Fox Islands at 2 oclock on the 20 of AugutsAugust This town is called Vinal Haven itincludes both North & South Fox Islands in Lat44 North Long 69, 10, population 1800 
 izing new branches, & holding conferences. &c.Feby. 26, 1836, at a conference held at bro. B. L. Clapp's in Callaway Co., Ky., I ordained A. O. Smoot & Benj. Boydston E^e^lders and B. L. Clapp & Dan. Thomas priests.Bros. Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labors of the ministry. Elder Smoot frequently accompanied me on my mission. Elder D. W. Patten returned to Tennessee, in april, and joined us in our labors, accompanied by his wife, it was a happy meeting, he related to me the blessings he had received in Kirtland during the endowments; we travelled and labored together; persecution raged against us; Elder Patten bore a strong and forcible testimony unt of ^to^ ^of^ the work of God, and when we were opposed by mobs he would rebuke them in great plainness; we were threatened, but not injured; the sick were frequently healed under our administrations. May 27, Elder Warren Parrish joined us, he came direct^arrived^ from Kirtland and joined us in our labors.  We held a conference on the 28th, at bro. Seth Utleys; 7 branches were represented con-taining 116 members. Abel Wilson and Jesse Turpin ^were^ ordained priests and Albert Petty ordained a Teacher. 31st, I was ordained under the hands of ^by^ David W. Patten a member of the second quorum of Seventies. WeWe continued to extended our laborsed over a circuit of several hundred miles, bro. Smoot labored continually with us and bro. Clapp frequently. We travelled two by two, only as ^except when^ we^&^ all met together to hold conferences.June 19, a states warrant was issued againstD. W. Patten, Warren Parrish & Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by Mathew Williams, a Methodist priest, and served by the Sheriff, Robert C. Petty.  Elders Patten and Parrish were taken by an armed mob of about fifty, under ^pretence^ form ^color^ of lawled by the Sheriff, a Colonel, 1st & 2nd major, with other officers, and a Methodist priest, with a gun on his shoulder I was in another County and not taken.  We were accused of prophecying falsely, by saying, that four persons who 
 [page covered] [w]ith our families both went into one room [page covered] [a]bout 14 feet square. Finally Br Young obtained a room and moved into it by himself then Orson Pratt & family moved into the same room with myself and family, ^A day of Gods Power^ while I was living in these cabinswith in the old barracks we experienced a day of Gods with the prophet Joseph. It was a very sickly time and Joseph had given up his Home in Commerce tothe sick and had a tent pitched in his door yard and was living in that himself, and the large emigration who had been driven out of Missouri was flocking intoCommerce but had no homes to go into was lying in the waggons in tents & on the ground and many were sick though the expenses they were subject to and Br Joseph had waited on the sick untill he was worn out and nearly sick himself. But in the morning of the 22 July 1839 he arose in themorning reflecting upon the salvation of the Saints of God in their persecutions & affilictions and hecalled upon the Lord in prayer and the power of God rested upon him mightely and he arose up^in the Name of^ as [did] Jesus healed all the sick around him in his daySo Joseph the prophet of God healed all around him upon 
 How to obtains revelations from GodIn order to obtain revelation from God and in orderto prove when we do obtain a revelation whether it is fromGod or not we must follow the teaching of the revelations ofGod unto us. St James sayes "if any man lack wisdom lethim ask of God who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him". [##James 1:5##] Again ask and you shall receive, â—Šâ—Šaskand it shall be given unto you. It was upon this promisethat Joseph Smith went before the Lord and prayed in the nameof Jesus Christ and asked for knowledge wisdom & understa-nding in order to know what to do to ^be^ saved and he plead thepromise of St James before the Lord and the Lord opened the heavens unto him, and the Father & Son was revealed unto himand the voice of the great Ellohem unto him was this is my Beloved Son hear ye Him this was the first revelation of Godto him and He did harken to the voice of Jesus Christ all hislife afterwards and received a code of revelations and the word ofthe Lord unto him as long as He dwelt in the flesh and left asstrong a testament as ever given to the Human family & sealed thattestament with his own life & blood, and we all have to pursuethe same course in order to obtain revelations from God. But I wish to impress this truth upon the rising generation and all who read thistestimony that the Lord does not give revelation, or send angels to men, or work miracles, to accomodate the notions of any manwho is seeking for a sign, when we have the principles of the Gospelrevealed to us through the mouth of the savior or by inspiredprophets or Apostles we have no need to ask the Lord to reveal them

 this occasion he healed all in his house anddoor yard Then in company with Sidney Rigdon &several of the Twelve Heber Kimball & Parley P Pratt who hadjust got out of prison accompanied him and he^went^ through among the sick lying on the bank of the Riverand he commanded in a loud voice in the nameof Jesus Christ to come up and be made whole andthey were all healed and when they had healed allthat were sick on the East side of the river they crossedthe Mississippi river in a ferry boat to the west sideto Montrose where we were. The first home they wentinto was President Brigham Youngs who was on hisbed sick at the time BThe prophet went into hishome and healed him and they all come out togetheras they were passing by my door Brother Joseph sayesBrother Woodruff follow me this was the ownly wordspoken by any of the company from the time they leftBrother Brighams House till we crossed the public squareand entered into Brother Fordham House He hadbeen dying for an hour and we expected each minutewould be his last I felt the power of God that  was overwhelming the prophet of God when we enteredthe House Br Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham 
 were baptized should receive the Holy Ghost in 24 hours, and that Christ should come the second time before this gen-eration passed away; the whole concern was a mob mock trial, contrary to law, justice, judgment or truth.On the 29th, I went to a baptist meeting house on Thompsons creek, to ^preach^ fulfil an previous appointment; the house was crowded with people, as I rose to speak in thepulpit a baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the door on horseback, & stepped in greatly agitated, and told the Deacon to forbid my preaching in the house, at the sametimecommenced a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling several lies, which I corrected before the people, which increased his rage; as I was forbidden to preach in the house, and had been invited, and travelled many miles to fulfil my appointment, ^I told the people^ I would like to preach & was willing to stand on a wood pile, a fence; a cart, or any place, they would appoint; a man rose and said he owned the land in front of the meeting house, and I might stand & preach on that, and welcome, all the congregation with the exception of the minister and one Deaconarose and left the house, walked across the street & formed seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention while I preached for an hour and a half on the principles of the Gospel; when I closed I gave liberty for any one to speak. Mr. Randolph Alexander rose and made a few remarks, it being the first time he^who^ had ^never^ heard a Mormon Elder speak ^before^, he said, the people of the present day made him think of a pen of hogs, the keeper would make a trough, and pour into it anything, hot or cold water, dish water or anything else, ^and they would drink it,^, but let a stranger come along and pour over a ba^s^ket of corn on the back side of the pen, & the hogs would be frightened and run and snort all over the pen; he said, it was so with the people, the priests would feed them with 
 unto us again for while the priesthood is rets restored tothe Earth and the revelations of God revealed to us through theMouth of prophets & apostles concerning the fullness of the Gospel, Doctrinordinances & principles we should study them and treasure upknowledge by faith & study out of the best books and the Holy Ghost will bring to our remembrance those things whichwe stand in need of in the self same hour that we are calledto teach the people, but when any Elder priest Elder prophetapostle or Messenger sent of God to preach the gospel gatherthe Saints, work in Temples, or perform any work for the Lordand that man is faithful and humble before the Lord in his prayers& duty and there is ay any snare or evil in his path, or the righteousto be sought out, or danger in the emigration of the Saintseither by the sea or land, or knowledge needed in a Temple thenthe Lord will reveal all that is necessary for the protection& benefit of his prophets, Apostles, Elders & seventy as we canall Testify in our experience for the last fifty years of ourlives in our labor in the vineyard of the Lord. The teachingof the prophet Joseph Smith to president John Taylor & the restof us was to obtain the Holy Spirit get acquainted with itwatch its operations and listen to the whispering of thatspirit and obey its voice and it soon would become aprinciple of revelation unto us. We have found this true in our experienceand in order to prove whether a revelation is from God or notwe follow out the principles revealed to us and we find that what wasmanifested to us proved true we know it was from God 
 any kind of doctrine, no matter how false, the people will swallow it down, but let a stranger come and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which will savethe people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the people are afraid of him.Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a book of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and several others followed his example.I.SD July 14, I wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery, and sent him a list of subscribers, and o for the Messenger and advocate, and a detail of my mission in the South. 18th, I rode in company with A. O. Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee river; there ferryman was absent, we were offered the use of the boat, & ferried ourselves, but not being much used to the business, and loosing one oar in the river, and having to row with one ^a^ broken oar, we landed a great distance below the usual place with a high circulation of blood and blistered hands, but our horsesleapt the bank and we went on our way to the Sandy, which we swam and spent the night at Thomas Frazer's30th, we rode to ^preached at^ Mr. David Crider's,  and preachedat his house, also on Sunday the 31st, ^where^ we were threatened with ^by^ a mob; I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs ofthe rabble, they did not mob us, but ^who^ went in the night and poisoned both of our horses, the one which I rodebelonging to bro. Samuel West, which died in 2 days afterwards,brother Smoot's recovedred, the hogs ^swine^ which ^that^ eat of the horseflesh also died.Augt. 11 I met with D. W. Patten and his wife; he and bro. Parrish had been driven out of Benton into Henry Co. and Elder Parrish had left for Kirtland 29th. We were visited by Elders T. B. Marsh and E. H. Groves, from Caldwell Co. Mo. andSep. 2, We held a conference at Damon's creek Callaway Co., Kentucky; several branches were represented, containing 
 for truth is one of his attributes & the Holy Ghost deceivethno man and when a man becomes acquainted with thewhisperings of the Holy Ghost to hims which is revelation He shouldbe very careful to obey it for his life may depend upon itrevelation is one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and for the benefitof my young friends who may read this work I will give anaccount of a few instances of my own experience in listeningto the revelations of the Holy Ghost to me in my missionsIn 1848 after my returne to winter Quarters from our pioneerjourney, I was appointed by the priesidency of the Church to take my family & go to Boston & gather up the remnant of the LatterDay Saints & lead them to the vallis of the mountains while onmy East I drove my carriage into the yard of one of the Brethrenin Indiana & Br Orson Hyde set his waggon by the side of mine not more than two feet apart I had DeminicusCarter of provo my wife & four children were with me myselfwife & one child went to bed in the carriage the rest slept in the home I had been to bed but a short time untill a voice said to meget up & move your carriage it was not thunder lightning or anearthquake but the still small voice of the spirit of God the Holy GhostI told my wife I must get up & move my carriage she asked what for I told I did not know except the spirit told me to do it I got up & moved my carriage several rods and set it by the side 
 & took him by the right hand Joseph [page covered] [hol]ding his hat in his left hand Br Joseph sawthat his eyes were glazed He speechless and uncon-cious He held his hand in his looking him in the sp face He says Br Fordham Do you not knowme[?] at first he made no reply but we could allsee the effects of the Spirit of God resting upon himHe again said Elijah do you not know me[?] with a low whisper he said yes, He then said have younot faith to be healed, His answer a little planerwas I am afraid it is to late if you had comesooner I think I might have been, He had the appearanceof a man waking out of sleep, it was from the sleepof Death Joseph then said do you not believe thatJesus is the Christ, I do Br Joseph. Then the prophetof God spoke with a loud voice as in the Majesty ofthe GodHead Elijah I command you in the Nameof Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. Thewords of the prophet was not like word of man butlike the voice of God. It seemed to me that the House shookfrom its foundation, Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from the dead [to] life and

The unbeliever mayask was there not deception in this, if there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever There was none with Elijah Fordham the dying man norwith those who were present, with him for a few minutesmore he would have been in the spirit world which to day^through the blessings of God he lived up to 1880 in which year^June 24 1880 being 41 years since that event he is alive in the^he died in Utah^Mortal body in Salt Lake City while all who were with him on that occasion with the exception of two are in thespirit world, Among the Number were Joseph & Hyrum SmithSidney Rigdon, Brigham Young Heber C Kimball George A.Smith and Parly Pratt, Orson Pratt & Wilford Woodruffare the ownly two living who were present at the time andwe soon shall mingle with those who have gone. as soon as we left Bro Fordhams we next visitedthe House of Joseph B Nobles who lay very low and

We made our way over the rocks & beaches the best we could untillw untill we found a home we landed without a farthing in money we rap[p]ed at the door a woman put her head out of the window and asked who was there & what we wanted I told her we were two strangers and wanted a bed to lie down untill morning, she let us in ang gaveus a bed and we slept untill quite late in the morning it being sunday when we arose and took breakfast it was nearly noon I asked her what she charged us for our entertainment She said we were welcome, I then asked her if there was any religion or Minister or Church on the Island she informed me there was a Baptist Ministerby the name of Newton who had a congregation and 
 of the Home as I was going to bed the same spirit said to mego & move your Mules away from that oak tree which wasone hundred yards north of our carriage I moved them to a [young]hickery grove & tied them up & went to bed in thirty minutsa whirlwind took the tree ^from the shaft near the ground^ to which my mules were fastened& carried it one hundred yards swept two fences in its courseand laid it prostrate through that yard where my carriage stoodand the top limbs hit my carriage as it was, In the morning Imeasured the trunk of the tree where my carriage stood and it measuredtwo feet & it came within a foot of Br Hyde waggon butdid not touch it, so by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God to me I saved my life, my wife, and child, & my animals & wentmy way rejoicing in the morning,. And in my returne with alarge company of Saints from Boston & the east, in 1850on my arival in pittsburgh I engaged a passage for myself& company on a Steemer to St Louis I had no soonerengaged the passage than the spirit says to me go not onboard of that Steemer neither you nor your Company I obeyedthe revelation to me & did not go on board but tookanother Steamer the first Steamer started about darkwith 200 passengers on board when 5 miles down the 
 119 members; Johnson F. Lane, Benj. L. Clapp and Randolph Alexander were ordained Elders, and Lindsey Bradey to the officeof  a priest by D. W.

O. SmootSep. 19, I parted Elders Marsh and D. W. Patten and wife and E. H. Groves started for Far West. I organized the first company of Saints who emigrated from the Southern states,which numbered 22 souls.I appointed Elder Boydston Prest. of the Coy. and counselled them to be united, and to remember their prayers night and day before the Lord.20,th, the camp started. I spent a few days visiting the branches, baptized and confirmed 8, and obtained 30 subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate. Oct. 20th, In company with A. O. Smoot & Jesse Turpin I started for Kirtland; this was the first time I had ever travelled on a steam boat, we left the steamer at Louisville on the 28th, and spent 19 days visiting Elder Smoots relations and preach-ing among the people; we visited the big bone lick;we arrived in Cincinnatti Nov. 17, where we saw thirteen persons dead and wounded taken from the Steamer Flora ^which had burst her pipes while running a race^; arrived in Kirtland on the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meeting the prophet Joseph, and many Elders, with whom I was acquainted in the camp of Zion. 29th, I heard Joseph preach in the Temple. In the afternoon I was called to speak and read the 56 chap. ofIsaiah, and made some remarks upon it, and gave an account of my mission in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the Saints.I was counselled by the Presidency to attend the schoolin the Temple taught by Prof. Haws, I studdied the Latin language and English Grammar, and boarded with bro. Ira Bond. I attended meetnigs with the Seventies and other Quorums during the winter of 1836â€“7, and recieved much valuable instruction 
 Ohio river the boat took fire burnt the tiller ropesso they could not reach shore and the lives of nearlyall were lost either by fire or water while we arrived in safety toour destination by obeying the revelation of the spirit of God to us. In another instance after attending a large conference in Apriland having a good deal of business to attend to I was somewhat weary and at the close of the conference I thought I would repare to my home and have a rest as I went into the yard the spirit says to me take your team & go to the farm which is some three miles South of the Tabernacle as I was putting the horses on the waggon Mrs Woodruff asked where I was going. I saidto the farm "what for, I do not know,["] but when I arrived there I found out. the creek had overflowed broke through my ditchditch surrounded my home, filled my barn yard & pigpen. my wife waiding in the water trying to turn it from thelot to save the home & the family but through my own exertionI soon turned it and saved much damage that mighthave accrued if I had not obeyed the voice of the spirit. This same spirit of revelation has been manifest by many of my brethrenin their labors in the kingdom of God, one of which I will here nameElder Charles C Rich while going from Sacramento to San-bernadino with a company of the Brothern. He had in his posessionquite a large amount of money to make payment on their purchase 
 Meeting house about two miles from there sowe thanked her for her kindness and walked tothe Meeting House and steped inside of the doorand stood untill a Deacon came to the doorI asked him to go & tell the Minister in thepupit that there was two servants of God atthe door who had a message to deliver to thatpeople & wished the privilege of delivering it. He sentword to us to come into the pulpit so we walkedthrough the congregation with our valieces underour arms, and took a seat each side of the Ministerwho was about to speak as we came to the doorHe arose and delivered his discours to the peopleof about half an hours length, when he closedhe asked me what was my wish I told him we wished to speak to the people any hour that wouldsuit his convenience and the people so he gaveout word that there were two strangers presentwho would speak to the people at 5 oclock. We werequite a wonderment to the people not knowingwho we were Mr Newton invited us home totea which we gladly exepted when we arrived athis home I opened my valiece and took out 
 dangerously sick when we entered the home BrotherJoseph took him by the hand and commanded himin the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made wholeand he arose & was immediately healed, and while thiswas going on the wicked mob in the place led by oneR Mourn had became alarmed and followed us intoBr Nobles Home But before them arrived in theHome Br Joseph had called upon Br Fordham tooffer prayer and while he was praying the mob enteredwith all the evil spirits that accompanied themas soon as they entered Br Fordham who waspraying fainted & sank to the floor as soon asJoseph saw the mob in the home he aâ—Šâ—Šâ—Š and bidthe room cleared of both that class of Men and^Devils^ immediately Br Fordham came to and finishedhis prayer, it shows what power evil spiritshave upon the tabernacles of men and the saintsare ownly saved from the power of the devil by thepower of God. This case of Br Nobles was the lastcase of healing of the day. It was the Greatest Day ofthe power of God and of healing members on the Earthsince the organization of the Church and Kingdom

This was the first time that I or [any]Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints(to my knowledge) had attempted to preach the Gospelto the inhabitants of any Island of the Sea fulnessof the Gospel, & the Book of Mormon to the inhabitantsof any Island of the Sea I had much liberty in speaking and informed the people that the Lord had raisedup a prophet and organized his Church as in the days 
 this was known to some rode agents in the city and they gathereda company of robers and went on ahead of Brother Rich and layin ambush intending to kill the mormans & rob them of theirmoney before reaching the company of robers they came to a big pathahead which shortened their distance the spirit said to BrotherRich to take that path the Brothren with him marveled athis course not knowing that enemies awaited them, but they arrived in safety at Sanbernadeno with theirlives & money, while the robbers marvelled why theirprey did not come,,I will now give one example in myown experience of the result of not obeying the voice of the spiritsome years since I had a part of my family living in RandolphRich County I was there on a visit with my team in theMonth of Dec one monday Morning my monitor the spiritwatching over me said to my me take your team & go hometo Salt Lake when I named it to my family who werethere they urged me very hard to stop longer through their persuasion I staid untill Saturday morning with the spiritpressing me very hard to go home I began to feel alarmed to think that I had not obeyed the whisperings of the spirit tome before I took my team & started early Saturday morningwhen I arrived at Woodruff the Bishop urged me tostop untill monday & he would go with me I told him 
 Dec. 20, 1836, I was present at the organization of thethird Quorum of seventies; there was^ere^ 27 ordained.Jan. 3, 1837, I was set apart to be a member ofthe first quorum of Seventies.6th, I visited the office of the Kirtland safetysociety, and saw the first paper that was issued from that institution,it was given to Jacob Bump in exchange for other notes, he wasthe first to circulate it.I heard Pres. Joseph Smith declare in the presence ofF. G. Williams, D. Whitmer, E. Smith, W. Parrish and others, thathe had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subjectof the Kirtland safety society, he was alone in a room by himself,he ^&^ not only had the voice of the spirit, but ^heard^ an audible voice uponthe subject; and said if the people would give heed to his counselall would be well.25th, at early candle light, ^a^ clouds began to arise inthe North East and reached to the north west, having the ap-pearance of fire, and it soon spread over the whole horizon, thereflection of the clouds upon the earth which was covered with snowhad a blood red appearance; it commenced at about 6 o'clock and lasted till past 10 p.m.29th, Prests. Joseph Smith and O. Cowdery addressed thesaints in the Temple, Joseph blessed the people in the nameof the Lord, and said, if we would be faithful, we should ariseabove our embarrassments and be delivered from the hands of ourenemies.30, I wrote an article ^on Faith^ which was published inthe Messenger and advocate.Feb. 19, I attended meeting at the Temple.Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on business for the church,but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away fromIsrael, yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they did notmake a calf to worship as did the Israelites, they turned  their hearts away from the Lord and from His servant Joseph,and had engaged in speculation and given away to false spirits 
 when we left Br Nobles, the prophet Joseph wentonto the bank of the river waiting for the Ferry boatto return back home with those who accompaniedhim. We accompanied him to the riverwhile waiting for the boat a man came to JosephSmith of the world, knowing of the miricles which hadbeen performed he having a pairs of twin childrenabout 5 months old old and both laying [each]night unto death aske[d] the prophet of he wouldnot go and heal them but they were some 2 milesfrom Montrose the prophet said he could not gobut after pausing some time he said he wouldsend some one to heal them and he turned to meand said you go with the man & heal his childrenand he took a bandanna red silk hankerchiefout of his pocket and gave to me and told me towipe their faces with the hankerchef when I administeredto them and they should be healed and he said unto meas long as you will keep that hankerchief it shallremain a league between us you and me I wentwith the man and done as the prophet commandedme & the children were healed and I keep possessionof the hankerchief unto this day. 
 of Christ and the ^ancient^ Apostles, with prophets & Apostlesand the gifts of the Church, as anciently and that the Lord had brought forth the Book of Mormon. At the close of my remarks Elder Hale bore testimony, I gave liberty for any one to speak that wished no one spoke at the close I gave notice that we should hold meeting during the next four evenings in the school house beginning with No. 1. The first 13 days of our abode on the Island we preached 17 discourses being invited by the Inhabitants to tarry with them I left a copyof the Doctrins & Covents with Mr Newton to read which he did do and the spirit of God bore testimonytestimony to him of its truths and he walked his room till midnight trying to decide what to do whether to receive or reject it and he with his family attended about a dozen of my first meet-ings then made up his mind contrary to the dictation of the spirit of God to him, to reject it and came out against me. But we commenced baptizing 
 Chapter 3rd preparing for our journey & MissionThe blessings of the prophet Joseph upp upon ourheads and his promises upon us. The power of theDevil manifest to hinder our performing our Mission(on the 1st day of July Joseph Smith & his counsellors SidyRigdon & Hyrum Smith crossed the river to Montrose to spendthe day with the Twelve and set them apart & bless thembefore they started upon their missions there were twelvein number & dined at my House. After dinner weassembled at Brigham Youngs Home for our MeetingBr Hyrum Smith opened by prayer After which the presidencylaid their hands upon our heads & gave us ablessing president Rigdon was mouth in blessing me they alsoblessed Sisters Young, Tayler & Woodruff the prophet Josephpromised us if we would be faithful we should againreturn to our families & friends and be blessed uponour missions and have many souls as seals of ourministry and returne again in peace and safety toour families & friends (all of which was fulfilled) Br Hyrumordained us to preach the first principles of the Gospeland thought that was about as much as this genera-tion could endure. Then Joseph arose and preached someprecious things of the Kingdom of God unto us in the power of theHoly Ghost some of which I will mention from my journalEver keep in exercise the principal of mercy and be ready 
 until they were darkened in their minds and many were opposed to Joseph Smith, and some wished to appoint David Whitmerto lead the church in his stead; in the midst of this cloud of dark spirits, Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this morningarose in the stand, when he appeared as though he wasmuch depressed, but soon the spirit of God rested upon hismmen and he addressed the assembly in great plainness forabout 3 hours, and put his enemies to silence. when he arosehe said, "I am still the President,â€” prophet, seer, Revelatorand leader of the church of Jesus Christ, and kingdom Godand not not man has appointed and placed me in this position, and no man or set of men have power to removeme or appoint another in my stead, and those who undertakethis, if they do not speedily repent, they will ^burn their fingers &^ go to hell.He reproved the people sharply for their sins, darkness andunbelief, the power of God rested upon him, and bore testimonythat his sayings were true.Mar. 23rd was spent in the Temple by thesaints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer. The Patriarch JosephSmith Sen. presided; the spirit of the Lord was poured outupon the people, a contribution was taken up for the poor.April 4, I received my washings and anointings in the house of the Lord, I spent the whole night in the Temple with others of the Seventies in prayer and fasting, the spiritof the Lord rested upon us, after 24 hours I partook of food.6th, The Presidency of the church, the Twelveapostles and other Quorums met in solemn assembly, and sealedupon our heads, our washings, anointings and blessings with aloud shout of Hossanna to God and the Lamb; the spiritof the Lord met ^rested^ upon us, after spending three hours in the upper room, the quorums repaired to the lower court, &the vails were lowered, the ordinance of washing of feet wasadministered, Elder H. C. Kimball washed my feet &pronounced blessings upon me; after this ordinance the vails ofthe Temple were rolled up, and Prest. Joseph Smith addressed 
 his flock. The first two we baptized was asea Captain & his wife by the name of Justis EamesBrother Johnathan H Hale went down into the seaand baptized them on Sunday the 3rd of Sept thefirst ever baptized upon any Island of the Sea inthis dispensation to my knowledge, and on the nextsabbath I baptized his Brother Ebenezar Eames anotherSea Captain and a young Lady. Mr Newton the Baptist Minister now commenced a war agaist usagainst us and sent to the South Island for a Mr Douglass a Methodist Minister to(with whom he had been at variance foryears) to come over and help him put downmormonism. He came over and held a conf--erence and got all the people together they could and he railed against Joseph the prophet and the Book of Mormon and he took the Book in his handand with an out stretched [hand] declaired he knew noneof the Judgments of God that would come upon himfor rejected that Book as the word of God 
 and will lead the Elders to them. A remarkable instance of this was manifest in my own experience in 1840 while laboring in Stafford-shire was preaching & baptizing daily and one night I went into the City Hall of the Town of Hanley and as I was about to arise to speak to a large assembly the voice of the spirit of God to me was this is the last meeting you will hold with this people for many days I was asstonished at this as I had a weeks appointments out before me I told the people it would be the last meeting I would hold with them for many days they were as much asstonished as I was at the close of the meeting several came forward for baptisim and many asked where I was going I told them I did not know, I went before the Lord and asked where I should go the voice of the Lord said go to the south I got into a stage & rode 80 miles south into Herefordshire and the first manshome I stayed was John Benbows who received me kindly & I conversed with him & his wife untill 2 oclock in the morning & I readily found out why the Lord had sent me there their was a company of 600 to which Br Benbow belonged called united Brethren who were desiringfor light and truth had got as far as they could and were praying for the Lord to open their way and the Lord had sent me to them and the resultwas that in the first 30 days after my arrival in their midst I baptized some 45 preacher of the united Brethren including Thomas Kington then presidind Elder & placed in my hands all their Chapels & homes licensed for preaching I baptized the whole of the 600 except one man and during eight months labor there I brought into the Church some 1800 Saints including near 100 preachers of the various denominations. Now I knew nothing about this people or their preperation for the Gospel untill the Lord sent me to them by revelation 
 the Elders for three hours, clothed with the spirit and power of God, he unbosomed his feelings in the house of his friends,â€” gave much instruction, he urged upon us the absolute necessity of giving strict heed to his teachings and counsel, and the Revelations of the Lord to the church, and be wise in all things, thatZion and her stakes may be redeemed and established, no more to be thrown down, he said, that the kings of the earth would yet become to behold the glory of Zion, and that great and glorious blessings would be bestowed upon the Saints in the last days. Hyrum Smith bore testimony, and was followed by Oliver Cowdery, who exhorted the Elders to keep within the bounds of their knowledge, and let the great mysteries of thekingdom alone, for the Gentiles had not a knowledge even of the first principles of the Gospel, ^he said^ it It is far better to preach what the people would call the small things of the kingdom, than to enter with the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel and John. The twelve broke bread which was distributed to the multitude, who eat and were filled, thanks wereas returned and the meeting closed at the setting of the sun. Â¶ The house was again filled at candle light, Prest. Smith requested the Elders to speak their feelings freely, and sing, exhort and pray, as the spirit should give utterance, the meeting continued during the whole night, many of the gifts were poured out upon the people; at break of day we were dismissed. I also spent the night of the 7th, in the Temple, with several of the Elders in prayer and praise before the Lord,the Holy Ghost rested upon us and the spirit of prophecy was given to us, and many things were shown us, by the holyspirit. AprilApril 9, Prest. Smith spoke in the afternoon, and said in the name of the Lord that His ^the^ judgments ^of God^ would rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends and friends of humanity, and in building up Kirtland, a stake of Zion; but had turned traitors to him, and the interests of the kingdom of God, and had given power 
 to forgive our Brother on ther first intimation of repentance and asking forgiveness for our Heavently Father will be equillyas merciful unto us also we ought to be willing to repentof ^and confess^ all of our own sins and keep Nothing back and Letthe Twelve be humble and not be exhalted, and bewareof pride and not seek to excell one above another but actfor each others good and honirably make mention of eachothers names ^in prayer^ before the Lord and before our fellow mendo not back bite or devour our brother. The Elders of Israelshould seek to learn by precept & example in this late ageof the world and be oblieged to learn ery thing we knowby sad experience I trust the remainder of the Twelve willlearn wisdom & not follow the example of those who havefallen. When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christstands before the congregations of the earth and they preachin the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and thepeople are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin andsay that that man has preached a powerful discourse,a great sermon then let that man or those men takeease that they do not ascribe the Glory unto themselves butbe careful that they are humble and ascribe the praise &Glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of theHoly Ghost priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have powerthus to speak, who art thou O man but dust, andfrom whom dost thou receive thy power and blessings butfrom God Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israelobserve this [FIGURE] key and be wise, ye are not sent out to betaught but to teach. Let every man be sober be bevigilent and let all his words be received with Grace 
 I will refer to one more instance in my experience upon the subject of revelationall the Latter Day Saints understand that we build Temples for the purpose of administering ordinances for our dead as well as for the living, and the Lord has opened the way in a remarkable mannerfor many of the members of the Church to obtain records of the names of their dead for several generation I had also obtained a record of some over 3000 of my Father & Mother family, after the Dedication of the Temple in St George president Young appointed me to preside over it, and when we commenced with in the Temple Ibegun to reflect how can I redeem my dead, I have some 3000 namewho are dead, that have been baptized for and how can I get endowments for them I had none of my family there, and if I had they would not be able to get endowments for so many. And while praying to the Lord to show me how I could redeem my dead the Spirit of God rested upon me and the voice of the spirit of God said to me go to and call upon the Son & Daughter of Zion in St George, to come into the temple of the Lord and get their Endowments for your dead and it shall be acceptable unto me saith the Lord, this fulled my soul with joy and turned a key that opened a field as wide as eternity for the salvation of our dead, and the redemption of man that we might magnifyour calling as Saviors upon Mount Zion. And one my birth day March 1, 1877, the day that I was 70 years, 154 sisters of St George went into the Temple & got Endowments for so many of the female portion of my dead and this principle was received by president Young and adopted from this houn and through the assistans of friends I have had nearly 2000 of my dead received Endowments in the Temple of the Lord 
 but (I never learned what his sentiments were upon this subject at the end of his tearm offourteen years ^imprisonment^ in the Thomastons penetentiaryfor a rape upon his daughter the judgment ofwhich was given upon the testimony of both wifeand daughter) I was present at & heard MrDouglass in his discours upon the occasionand took minutes of the same when he closedI came and informed the people I would meetwith them next Sunday in the meeting house &answer Mr Douglass and wished him as wellas the people to be present I informed the peoplethat Mr Douglass had made many fals statementsagainst Joseph Smith and the mormons a people withwhom he had No aquaintance and he hadmisquoted much scripture all of which I wishedto correct. We continued to baptize the peopleon the North Island untill we had baptized everyperson who owe dollars in the Baptist MeetingHouse I then followed Mr Douglass home 
 and keep in mind that it is a day of warning andnot of many words. Act honest before God & men bewareof sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in whomyou have no confidence be ^honest^ open and frank [illegible] in allyour intercourse with mankind I wish to say tothe Twelve and all the Saints to profit by this important keythat in all your trials, troubles, and temptations afflictionsbonds, imprisionsments and death se[e] to it that you donot betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray yourBrethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God whetherin the bible Book of Mormon or Doctrin & Covenants orany of the word of God Yea in all your troubles see thatye do not this thing lest innocent blood be found inyour shirts and ye go down to Hell. We may ever knowby this sign that there is danger of our being lead toa fall & aposticy when we give way to the devil so as toneglect the first known duty but whatever you do donot betray your friend the forg[o]ing are some of the importantinstructions given to the Twelve by the prophet Josephbefore they started upon their missionsIn as much as the devil had been in a means not [prevented]by the Twelve going to Far west & returning without laâ—Šâ—Šn itseemed as though the Destroyer was determined to makesome other affect upon us to hinder our performing ourmission for it seemed that as soon as any one of theA Apostles begins to prepare for starting they were smitten 
 into the hands of our enemies against us; ^t^They had oppressed the poor saints ^& had brought sought to bring distress th upon them^, and had become covenant breakers,for which they ^will feel the^ wrath of God,^.^ he said, they would become whited walls.April 13 1837, I married Phebe W. Carter daughter of Ezra and Sarah Carter of Scarborough, Maine, the ceremony was performed, at the house of Prest. Joseph Smith, by Fred. G. Williams Esq. the prophet Joseph was expecting ^had appointed^ to marry us, but his life was sought by a mob and he had to flee. 15, I received my Patriarchal blessings under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph Smith Sen. My wife having received her Patriarchal blessings from him previously.May 5[th], while laboring for Joseph Young, we ^Kirtland^ wereasvisited with a sudden storm of wind and rain, a vain ^current^ of it passedsouth of the Temple in the form of a whirlwind or tornado, which destroyed and injured several buildings, it clo cros crushed ^one of^ Joseph Young'sbuildings and removed the one we were in some 10 feet, but no person was injured. Â¶ I felt impressed to go out upon a mission, the spirit was upon me & lead me to go to Fox islands called Vinal Haven, bordering East upon the ^east coast of the^ state of Maine, it was a country I had never visited, I named my feelings upon the subject to Elders Kimball, Rigdon and others, they encouraged me to go. Elder Kimball blessed me and said in the name of the Lord I should be blessed and prospered on my mission and do a good work; I made a proposed to Jonathan H. Hale to accompany me onmy mission, which he did.Mayâ€”31, I left my wife and friends in Kirtland, and walked to Fairport in company with bro. Hale, we were joined by Milton Holmes, & took the steamer Sandusky and arrived in Buffalo June 1st, and Syracuse on the 4th, â€” walked 36 miles to Richland, Oswego Co. N.Y. and called upon my two brothers Azmon & Thompson, whom I had not seen for several years; we visited the churches as far as Sacketts' harborâ€”called upon Archd. Patten and delivered to him some letters from Warren Parrish, ^in^ which were enclosed many ^one^ hundred ^dollar^ bills, which he had 
 and thousands of others have received the same blessings in the same wayPresident Young received revelation in that Temple & there are yetmany revelations to be received in the last days concerning the redemptionof the dead many other subjects but they will all be manifest indue time through the proper to authority unto the Church & kingdomof God. There are many other manifestations of the power of God andthe revelations of Jesus Christ to us in our lives but I have saidsuffient upon this branch of the subject.we have been called by revelation to give indowments tomany of the dead honorable men of the Earth & our own Nationwho were not members of our family, but I had said suffi-cient upon this track of the subjectPatricharchial Blessings & their fulfillmentThe office of the patriach is to bestow blessings upon their posterityand the children of men. In section ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56|D. C. 107## The Lord says thatthree years previous to the death of Adam he called Seth, Enis,Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, & Methuselahwho were all High priest with the resedue of his posterity who were righteousinto the Valley of  Adam-ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them his last blessing,, And Adam predicted whatsover should befalhis posterity unto the latest generation these things were all written in the Book of Enoch and are to be testified of in due time AbramIsaac & Jacob were patriarchs and blessed their posterity and allthat Jacob said & sealed upon the head of his Twelve sons have allbeen fulfilled to the very letter as far as time would admit offof we have partiarchs the same in our day Father Joseph Smith 
 with chills and fever or sickness of some kind nearlyall the Quorum of the Twelve began to be sick and their families so it still required a good deal of faith and perserverance to be exercised in order to start off on a Mission with the chills & fever. On the 25 July for the first time in my life I was attacked with the chills & fever this I had every other day which laid me prostrate each day my chill was upon me My wife Phebe was also soon taken down with chills & fever as were quite a Number of the Twelve I spent 18^days^ in Montrose with my family after I was taken sick before I started upon my missions. The 17 day of August was the last day I spent at home in Montrose and although sick with the chills & fever most of the day I made what preparations I could to start on my ^the^ mission on themorrow a mission of four thousand miles to preach the Gospel to the Nations of the Earth and that to without money purse or scrip with the power of disease resting upon with a shak[e] of the fever & ague each alternate day but but yet I do this freely for Christ sake trusting in him for the recompense of [renewal]. May the Lord give me grace according to my day and â—Šcâ—Šâ—Šs for my [ink blot] [fire] & a safe return to my family & friends while fâ—Šâ—Šter [ink blot] askin the name of Jesus Christ Amen 
 To the South Island and preached theGospel to and baptized nearly all the membersof his Church. The excitement became greatupon both Islands, and on Sunday the17 of Sept, I met a large assembly from bothIslands in the Baptist Meeting house andtook up the same subject that Mr Douglasshad dwelt upon against the Book of mormonand our principles I spoke 2 1/2 hours andanswered ery every objection against the Book ofMormon or Joseph Smith or our principlesI had good attention and the people seemed satisfiedat the close of the meeting Elder Hale administeredthe ordinance of baptism, Mr Newton inorder to try to save his cause went to themain land and brought over several ministerswith him and held a protracted meeting to tryto stop the work of God among the people, but itwas of no avail for the whole people wouldattend our meeting and receive the word of Godand we continued to baptize. We visited the dwelling 
 taken from the Kirtland bank, â€“ having been a Clerk in that institution., HeWe crossed the lake Ontario, visited upper Canada,and attended a conference, May 10th, with Elders John E. Page and James Blakesly, in the township of Bastard, Leeds Co.,there was eight branches represented containing 300 members,13 elders, 5 priests, 8 teachers and 6 deacons. Elder Wm. Draper and myself ordained 7 Elders, 9 Priests, 11 teachers and 5 deacons: 5 were baptized by Elder Page at the close of the Conference.A woman was possessed of the Devil and greatly afflicted, much of the time was dumb, 4 of us laid hands upon her, and cast the Devil out of her in the nameof Jesus Christ, and she was made whole and gave thanks unto God, and went on her way rejoicing. Â¶ We visited several other branches and preached the word of God and several of the sick were healed. Â¶ We returned to Kingston.â€”took steamer for Oswego and canal for Albany; we ^bros.^ John Goodson, Isaac Russell & John Snider accompanied us from Canada, and left us at Schenectady, to join Elders Kimball, Hyde and Richards at New York, to go to England.We walked from Albany to Farmington. Conn. â€” attended a conference of the saints in Canaan â€” arrived at my fathers house July 6th, this was the first time I had ever seen my Father or relatives in Conn. since I joined the church; they received me kindly. On the 10th, I preached in the city hall in Colinsville, and a mob gathered and attempted to break up the meeting, with fife and drum, hollowing and yelling; they were stirred urged on by a presbyterian priest; at the closeof the meeting the priest came to me with his rabble and asked many questions; he said, I had no right to my opinion, and no man had a right to preach the Gospel unless he had a collegiate education, I told him I would admit that point when he could tell me ^at^ what 
 [page folded] of most of the inhabitants of the Islandswhile standing upon Mr Carvers farm on the East end of the north Island we counted 55 Islands somewere inhabited but the majority of them were not, we alsosaw twenty ships under sail at the same time we had no lack for food while upon these Islandsfor if we did not wish to trouble any of our friends for a dinner we would borrow a spead or hoe & bucket& go onto the beach & dig a peck of clams & boil them and they would make us a delicious meal which we often practiced, On the 5 Sept, Elder Hale & myself went onto the top of a high granite rock upon the South Island, for prayer and supplicationwe sat down upon under a pine growing out of a fissure of the rock and Brother Hale read the ##Jeremiah 16:16|XVI Chapter## of Jeremiah speaking of the hunters andfishers that God would chuse up in the last days to gather Israel and of a truth here we were onan Island of the sea standing upon a rock where we could sirvey the gallant ships and also theIslands which were as full of rock holes & coves as anypart of the Earth. But what had brought us hereto search out the blood of Ephraim the honest andmeek of the Earth, and gather them from there 
 The Father of the prophet Joseph was the first patriarch inthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He gavea great many blessings unto the Latter Day Saints which arerecorded, and many of them have received their fulfillment, when heputs hands upon the head of a person to bless them it seemed asthough the heavens were opened unto him, and he could reveal thewhole life of the person. He gave me my patriarchal blessing in the Temple of the Lord in Kirtland on the 15 day of April 1837. Many mar-velous things which he sealed upon my head in which I could seeno earthly chance for their fulfillment has already been fulfilledto the very letter one or two instances I will name. He said Ishould have access to the treasures hid in the sand to assist me in mynecessities in gathering myself and others to Zion. While in Cambridgeportgathering up the Sants in 1850, Allexander Boblam went to Cal-afornia on business and the Saints there who were diging gold filleda little buck skin sack with gold dust and sent to me to assistme on my mission by the sale of this treasure from the sands of CaliforniaI was enabled to gather myself family & a number of others to Zionin the Mountains of Israel. He also said I should have power tobring my Father & his houshold in to the Chur Church of Christ while onmy misson to Fox Islands I visited my Father in Farmington Conn ^Ct^and preached the gospel to him and baptized him & all hishoushold including my Step Mother & ownly Sister M anda Methodist Class leader who was boarding at my fathers 
 Chapter 4. Leaving my family, starting upon my missionsand Incidents upon the JourneyAug 8, 1839 Early on this important morning I arose from my sick bed, laid my hands upon the head of my wife Phebe and blessed her and departed from her ^the^ embrace of my companion and left her almost without food or raiment the necessaries of life she parted with me with this fortitude that becomes a Saint realizing the responsibility of her compan-ion.

In this dream the final judgment was portrayed to me, and I saw hosts of persons depositing their riches 
 desecting room than a missionary Joseph replyied what did you say that for get up & go along all will be right with you. I name these incidents that the recorder may know how the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles started on their missions to England in 1839 Elder John Taylor was agoing with me and we were the two first ^two^ of the Quorum that started on the mission and Br Taylor was about the ownly well man there was in the Quorum the rest being sick soon a brother came along with a waggon and took us in as we were passing through the place we came to Parley P Pratt who was strip[p]ed to his shirt and pants bare headed& Barfoot hewing a log preparing to build him a cabbin cabin he says Br Woodruff I have got no money but I have got an empty purse which I will give you which he brought to me which I thanked him for went a few roads further & met Br Heber C Kimball in the same condition asParley hewing a log to build a cabins.

I had been solicited to preach to the citizens of Farmington by many prominent men, but every room which was offered me, including the town hall was closed against me by the Rev. Noah Porter, Pastor of the Presbyterian church, until the Methodist church was offered me, which he had not room ^influence^ to close, 2 hoursafter I gave out the appointment the house was filled,and I preached to a very attentive congregation, including my Father and his household, for an hour and a half upon the first principles of the Gospel; I gave liberty to the assembly to ask any questions, or find any fault with what I had said, but I met with no opposition.â€”20th, I left my Father's house and in company with my wife, took stage and rode ^by stage^ to Hartford. â€”21st, Not having money to pay the fare for ^us^ both myself and wife, I paid her fare in the stage to New Rowley, Mass., and Iwalked through a hot sultry day 15 hours, averaging three and a half miles per hour, making 52 miles. 22nd. I walked 48 miles.23rd, I walked 36 miles and arrived at Elder Nathaniel Holmes', in R New Rowley, at 2 o'clock p.m., making 136 miles on foot ^in^ a little over two days and a half, I met with my wife 
 My Father was gathered to Salt Lake City with the Saints where he diedaged 83 years. He said I should be wrapt in the arms of heaven andan angel of God should teach me many things this was fulfilled in thehouse of Abram O Smote in Kentucky in the spring of 1835. The patriarchalso told me that I should be delivered from my enemies (whowould seek my destruction) by the mighty power of God & the adm-inistrations of Angels. This was marvelously fulfilled while inthe City of London in 1840 Heber C Kimball George A Smith& myself went to London together in the winter of 1840 the first Elderswho had attempted to establish the Gospel in this great & mightyas soon as we commenced, the power of the Devil was manifestthe evil spirits gathered to gether for our destruction and at timesthey have great power, and would destroy all the Saints of God ifthey were not restrained by the power of God Br Smith and myselfwere alone together and had retired to our rest each occupying a cotby ourselves within 3 feet of each other we had only just laid downuntill there seemed to be a legion of Devils made war upon usto destroy our lives and we were strugling for our lives in themidst of this warfare of evil spirits untill we were nearly [crushed]to death and I began to pray the best I could in the midst of thestruggle and asked the Father in the name of Jesus Christ to spare ourlives and while three personages entered the room clothed in whiteand surrounded with light walked to our bedside laid hands uponour heads and we were instantly delivered and from this time had 
 and spent the night with with a Brother Merrills the day following a Brother Perkins ^we rode 10 miles to Br Perkins and he^ took us in hiswaggon and carried us to McComb from thence to Brother Carloss Smith I rode for hours during the day over a very rough road of stones and stumps lying  on my back in the bottom of the waggon shaking with the ague and I suffered much. We held a meeting in a grove near Carloss Smith and here Elder Taylor baptized George Miller who afterwards was ordained a Bishop, at the meeting the Saints gave us $9 & George Miller a horse to help us on our journey, I rode to Rochester with Father Coultrin where I had an interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints which I had brought up with me from Fox Islands in 1838 I spent several days with them and at Springfield where Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies in pamphlet form of a brief schedule of the persecutions ^and suffering^ of the LatterDay Saints by the inhabitants of the State of Missouri. We sold our horse and in company with Coultrin FatherColtrin Br Taylor & myself left Springfield & continued our journey  I having the chills & fever nearly every other day which made it very distressing for me to ride in a lumber waggon shaking with the ague on the 24 Aug we [rode to] Terre haute and spent the night with Dr Modesett 
 no more troubled with evil spirits while in the City of Londonas soon as they administered unto us they withdrew from the roomand the light withdrew with them & darkness returned, and my otherof the saying of the patriarch Joseph Smith in my blessing havebeen fulfilled in my experience, but I have said sufficient uponthe subject all the blessings that are sealed upon our headswill be fulfilled & many more if we are faithful & live for themIn closing my testimony I wish to say that I do not thinkthat the Lord ever sends an Angel to the Earth to visit thechildren of men unless it is necessary to deliver a dispensationof the Gospel or to declare a message or perform ^a work^ that cannot bedone otherwise. It required an Angel of God to deliverthe gospel to Joseph Smith because it was not on the Earth, and this was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord through John the Revelator ##Revelation 14:6|Rev 14 Ch 6 vers## and soin regard to the administration of Angels in all ages ofthe wor[l]d it is to deliver a message and perform a workwork which cannot otherwise be accomplished 
 and Elder Milton Holmes, at his Fathers house; I spent several days in preaching to the Saints in that region.Aug. 1, We left New Rowley, and was joined by Elder Hale, who accompanied us to Saco, Maine.7th, I accompanied my wife to her Fathers house inScarborough, ^Maine^ we were kindly received and entertained ^received^; it was the first time I had seen any of her relations. We found Mother Carter very sick. I spent several days visiting the Saints in that region. On the 10th, I accompanied Ezra and Ilus Fabien Carter,my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excursion; we caught with hooks 250 cod fish, haddock and hake, and saw 4 whales; it being the first time I had ever seen that class of fish that swallowed Jonah. 18th, I left my wife and in company with Elder Hale, ^I^ started to fill my mission on Fox islands, we walked to Portland and spent the night at Mr. Samuel Hale's.19th, We took the steamer Bangor & rode 85 miles to Owls head, where we arrived at sunset, without means to prosecute our journey further, we retired to a high hill, and bowed before the Lord and prayed that he would open our way, the spirit of the Lord rested upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers would be answered; as we arose from our knees a sloop came into the harbor, we went to the Captain and enquired where he was going, he replied, through the channel of vinal Haven; he tookus on board and landed us on North Fox Islands, at 2 a.m.on the 20th, it being very dark we wandered ^in the dark^ about for an hour, rambling over the rocks and bushes, found the house of Mr. Nathaniel Dyer where we ^&^ were entertained; it being sunday morning and feeling anxious to commence our work, Mr. Benj. Kent piloted us to theBaptist meeting house, occupied by Elder Gideon J. Newton, pastor of the only religious denomination upon the Island, at the door, I sent for the Deacon and told him I wished him to inform the minister that we were servants of God and wished to deliver a message to that people, the ^minister^ sent word for us to come into the pulpit, accordingly with valize in hand, we walked up into the pulpit, and took a seat on each side of him, when he closed his discourse, he asked me what hour 
 but I suffered much with the chills & fever Elder Taylorup to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health butthe Destroyer did not intend to make him an exceptionto the rest of the Apostles for on the 29 Aug he fell tothe ground as though he had been knocked down seemed to havefainted away but soon revived but on the following dayit seemed as though the enemy made a powerful graspupon his life. He fainted away several times and seemed as though he would die we stoped several times withhim at a home by the way side we then took him intoa waggon & drove to Brother Horace S Eldridge and spentthe remainder of the day & night [feeding] him and inthe morning Br Tayler recovered so for that he thoughthe would be able to ride so we started on our journeyon the Morning of the 30 and we travelled 40 miles toLouisville and spent the night with the family of BrJames Townsend. We felt terribly shaken upbeing in such a weak state Br Townsend was absentfrom home but we were kindly entertained by Sister Townsendin the morning Elder Taylor though very weak felt disposedto try to continue his journey. We traveled 14 miles to Germantown was quite sick at night and seemed to have the Billious fever setted settled upon himand I was very feeble myself

 we would like to speak, I told him at 5, he gave out our appoint-ment, and invited us to his house, I asked him how many school houses there were on the island, he answered said, four, and gave me their names, I asked him if they were free for any one to preach in, he answered in the affirmative; I took out my bible, book of Mormon, and doctrine and covenants and laid them all upon his stand, he promised to read them.; the hour of meeting arrived,  I preached to a full house upon the first principles of the Gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord had raised up a prophet, and had commenced to establish his church and kingdom again upon the earth, in fulfilment of the ^His^ word of God as spoken through the ancient prophets and apostles; this was the first discourse ever delivered by any latter-day Saints upon this chain of islands; Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out appointments for preaching in the four school houses, the people came out en masse to investigate the principles which we taught, in 14 days we preached 19 discourses,when Cap. Justice Ames and wife were baptized by Elder Hale, Elder Newton, the baptist minister, with his family, attended twelve of our meetings, read the books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lord that our doctrine was true, and he had a hard struggle for days inhis mind to know which to do, receive, or reject it, he finally resolved to reject it, and took a stand against us, he & commenced preaching against us, he also sent for Mr. Douglass, the Methodist Minister, on the South Island, to come over and ^&^ help him; he had been long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but they became ^very^ friendly and united in a war against us;. We continued preaching daily until be we baptized most of the members of Mr. Newton's church, and those who owned the meeting house.I followed Mr. Douglass home to his own island, and com-menced preaching to his church, and baptized a good share of his members;, among whom were several sea Captains. Ministers from the main land were sent for, who came over and tryed to puta stop to the work by preaching and lying about us; but the work continued to roll on, they wished me to work a miracle to convince them that my doctrine was true, I told them they 
 On the day following Sept 1, being Sunday Br Taylor concluded to spend the day & hold a meeting it wasa German settlement Elder Taylor wished me to speakwhich I did upon the first principles of the GospelElder Taylor followed me & spoke untill he wasquite exhausted not realizing his bodily [condition]we returned to the Inn where we were staying &stopping I was taken with a chill & fever & had a sick night and Br Taylor was quitesick. And the following day sept 2 was a painfulday to my feelings. It was evident that Br Taylorhad a setted fever upon him and would not beable to travel and Father Coultrin was resolvedto continue his journey and in consultation withTaylor he thought it better for one sick man to beleft than for two as I was sick with the chills & feverso that I was not co able to render him present assistanceand not able to take care of myself under these circumstancesBr Tayler advised me to continue with my journey withBr Coltrin and make the best of my way to New-York. Accordingly I done so After committing him 
 into the Hands of God though painful I tookthe parting hand with him I left him in German-town Wayne Co Indiana and in the Hands of a MercifulGod and a kind and benevolent family who promised to do every thing in their power to make him comfortableuntill his recovery, which they did do though hepassed through a severe course of the Billious feverand was sick night [nigh] unto death but through themercy of God he recovered from his sickness andcontiued his journey and we next met in the Cityof New York I continued to journey with Father Coultrinto Cleveland where we parted on the 10 Sept I wenton board of a steamer for Buffalo but was 3 daysand night in a storm before we made the Harbor andwhen we did land it was midnight and do so we raninto a schooner & stowe it in, from Buffalo I traveled toalbany in a canal boat and had a shake of theague daily while on the journey.

The northIsland is 9 miles long and 2 wide; population 800, a post office, a store, a grist mill, 4 school houses, and a small branch of thebaptist church; the land is rather rocky and rough, yet there are many good farms which produce good wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principal timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch,rasp and goose berry grow in great abundance, sheep are the principal stock.South Fox island comes as near being without any formas anthing I ever saw, and it would be difficult for a historian to give a description of it, it is about 10 miles long and 5 wide, and is one universal ^a^ mass of rocks, much of it ^principally^ granite,formed into shelves, hills, hollows, and cut up into nooks, ^nooks^ pointsand canons ^ravines.^ to make room for the ^by^ coves and harbors, which run throughand through the island, population 1,000.I do not recollect of ever seeing a horse on either itsland,there are some small patches ^of land^ under cultivation, but it is at theexpense of great labor and toil,.  Many ^resident^ fish^ermen,^ ^fish^ at New Foundland, ^&^ bring their fish ^them^ home, and dry them upon flakes; they annually supply the market with a great amount of codfish, mackerel and boxed herring. The latter island contains two stores, three tide saw mills, 6 school houses, a small branch of the Methodist church and a priest.

On the 27, Sept my Grand Mother (on my Mothers side) Anna Thompson died 84 years of age at Avon, it was a singular incident that she with her husband Lot Thompson and Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thompson all of one family died the year they were 84 years of age I was not ableto attend my Grand Mothers Funeral. On the 4Oct ^1839^ my uncle Adna Hart died aged 43 years I had visited him in his sickness and preached the Gospel to him and he was believing and on his death bed sent me a request that I would preach his funeral sermon I had been associated with him from my youth up I was at the time having the chills and fever daily afflicted with a severe

Our enemies made attempts to break up our meetings.Jan. 15, 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the united states revenue cutter, brought on shore a swivel and joined the mob, parading near the house where I was preaching, and discharged it several times, followed by ^accompanied with^ small arms, with the intention of breaking up the meeting; some of the mob gathered around

 to see what effect this would have, I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgements of God that awaited the wicked, and shook my garments in the presence of the people, and told them I was clear of their blood,  byut they only heard my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon and musketry; before I closed speaking, the sailors went back on board of the revenue cutter. At the close of the meeting I baptized 2, two, also one next day, and while baptizing the mob again commenced firing guns.  The bBaptists and Methodists got up the mob. Mr. Douglass, the methodist priest, when argument failed him,applied to all the magistrates for warrants against me; they refused to grant them, as he had no cause of complaint butreligious persecution.Feby. 13, I crossed in the mail boat to Hampden, and ordained James Townsend; we walked together through deep snows, and visited and preached in the towns of Searsmont,Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hampden, and twice in the city hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, and returned to Fox islandsvia Casteem and the isle of Holt â€” arrived in Vinal haven March 8,: Elder Townsend returned home.March 22, I accompanied bro.

On Sunday May 28 Joseph Smithaddressed the people in the Temple upon the subject of the apostacy in the Church in Kirtlandthe spirit of murmuring complaining, and aposticy had increased throughout Kirtlanduntill it was almost difficult to tell who was Joseph friends and who were notthis spirit had been incresed in the family circle in secret chambers, and in the streetsuntill many ^had apostitized^ were apostitizing not both in high places and through the whol bodyof the Church and many were taking strong grounds against Joseph they weretrying to cast him down and destroy his influence. This grieved Joseph to theheart to have to pass through such perils among fals brethren. But notwithstandingthis thick cloud of darkness which hung over Kirtland Joseph ^He^ remained unmovedin the cause of God and was determined to magnify his calling and leave the evilin the hand of God. At this time the number of his friends that occupied high stationin the Church that had faith and moral courage to stand by him shoulder to shoulder were vary few among the number was Brigham Young who stood by him in evry trial he was also sustained by Heber C Kimball Sidney Rigdon and a few othersit was in the midst of this scene of things that Joseph entered the standcongregation and arose in the stand and spoke to the people in the name of the Lord in hisown defence the Lord was with him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the honest in heart that he would stand while his enemies would fall. SidneyRigdon followed him as he did several others and sustained him in his positionWarren Parrish spoke against him in the bitterness of his heart as had some of thetwelve before, but the people could discern the difference of the spirit between Joseph andhis enemies.

 with the intention of breaking up the work upon these islands, but it did not accomplish it.11th, I was visited by Elders Townsend and Milton Holmes, who attended conferences with me upon both islands, and bore their testimony to the people, but the spirit of opposition increased to a great height. I was warned by the spirit ^of the Lord^to leave for a season, and take a western mission; after visiting the saints from house to house, and praying with, and encour-aging them, I left on the 28th, and went to the main land with Elders Townsend & Holmes.
