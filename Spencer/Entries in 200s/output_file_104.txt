We next passed the farmhouse crowned with the fruits of a dairy which was so large that it required  a hors mill to churn the butter. the hors was upon the tread wheel for that purpose as we passed along.  smaller wheels are often in use whare the dairies are not so large and they are often turned by a sheep, a dog, or  a boy; others are larger still and carried by water. After walking a distance in the state above named we took  a by path and rose a high hill the road was strewed with a great variety of flowers the honey suckle andc. we soon came  to the top of the hill whare we had a beautiful view of the surrounding country we sat down under the shade of a  chesnut and took a survey of the distant fields of grain which presented a pleasing prospect. and while the birds tuned  their melodious notes we bowed our knees in prayer to the Author of every blessing.

Edwin P Merriam Clerk of Said Conference   ENDENTRY concerning the case of Brother Brewster I was one that opposed his ordination and I was much surprised that both the chairman and clerk did not do the same instead of urging it forward for Br Brewster maintained the same principle and possessed the same spirit for which he was cut off from the church in Kirtland by the high council and even in this case he came forward and demanded the High and Holy priesthood at our hands in the in the name of Jesus Christ I did not consider this to be the way that Aaron took the ministry upon himself consequently I opposed it and the spirit of God opposed it also and after a struggle truth prevailed    ENDENTRY March 13, 1839 ~ Wednesday   March 13th I being pressed in spirit to go to Quincy Adams County Illinois to visit the body of the church which had fled to that place to find an asylum for a season from the perilous persecutions that they were receiving by the Inhabitants of the state of Rochester Quincy stands on the bank of the child and also Whittle froom thence we rode to Brother John Herret's and spent the night we had a plesent interview together.

The Saints at times stood in their own defence and some of their enemies fell befor them and in consequence of which the Governour issued orders for the final extermination of the saints out of the state and sent a general after his own heart to execute his orders forthwith and this is the cause of there leeving the state and coming to Quincy. the whole city far west had to surrender to the melitia the Presidency with about 60 others was cast into prision and cha ins, they are all delivered excepting eleven persons the mob used every exertion to take the life of Joseph and others but through the mercy of God there lives were in the hands of God and not there enemies.

ENDENTRY April 26, 1839 ~ Friday   April 26th 1839. The events of this day are worthy of record for a Revelation of God and commandment is this day fulfilled and that to under circumstances which to all human appearance could not have been done The Lord had given a commandment to the Twelve to assemble upon the building spot of the house of the Lord in far west Caldwell Co Mo on the 26th day of April and there take the parting hand with the saints to go to the nations of the earth. (See Aug 10th 1838) But persecution had arisen to such an highth that about ten  thousand souls of the saints had been driven from the state, and the city far west almost made desolate and lade waste while at the same time the Presidency Joseph and his council with other Elders were in prision  and they had been under the sentance of death several times because of their religion and they would have been put to death had not the Lord saved them for their lives were in his hands and notwithstanding the lives of those men were preserved yet there were about thirty five souls martered and put to death David W. Patten one of the Twelve Apostles were among the martered. And not ownly so but the Missourians had sworn that the revelation above alluded to should not be fulfilled. It was in the midst of these imbaressments that we mooved forward to the building spot of the house of the Lord in the city of far west and held a council and fulfilled the revelation and commandment and took our leave of the saints and rode 32 miles and camped 32 miles   ENDENTRY COUNCIL   At a council held at Far West by the Twelve, High Priests, Elders, and Priests on the twenty sixth of April 1839 The following resolutions were adopted Resolved that the following persons should be no more fellowshiped in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints but excommunicated from the same, viz Jacob Scott senr and Sister Cavanaugh, wife, Simeon Gardner, and Freeborn Gardner.

Elder Alpheus Cutler then placed the stone before alluded to in its regular position after which in consequence of the peculiar situation of the Saints he thought it wisdom to adjourn untill some future time when the Lord should open the way expressing his determination then to procede with the building FIGURE See Sept 25th 1838   ENDENTRY Written upon the Death of Elder Missouri in 1838, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. He was the first marter of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints chosen to build up the kingdom of GOD and prepare for the coming of Christ   Hear O earth, Israel thy dark slumber break as the American gentile trembles at the thought that an angel again should visit the earth and the abundance of light and truth reveal, which lays babylons mighty towers in desolations vault, while Zion proves a refuges for the saint that is prepared for the second comeing of Jesus Christ. The fulness of times arived a youth of the loins of ancient Joseph cries to God, the veil of eternity rends in twain, to earth an angel bends his way and comforts a Joseph's heart while light and truth enwraps his soul. Truth startels from the dust to do its work, like the unicorn Ephraims horns appear in the rolling of the kingdom of God. to rend the garb of ignorance and superstitions reign, to make room for the church of Christ as out of the wildern- ess she comes to stand upon the earth in human view  with all her perfect body. Twelve apostles of Jesus Christ were chosen, and DAVID PATTEN whose life with Christ was hid in God among them stood. and being clothed with the spirit of his mission he went forth in defence of the word of God. his voice was herd, from Missouri he blew the gospel trump At his command the blind did see, the lame did leap, the sick were healed, and light and truth prevaled. plain in his precept faith his constant shield, he feared no power of earth. By the power of the Holy Ghost oft the priesthood he confered. Willford received it from under his hand while the spirit bore testimony of its truth, but David's earthly mission was of short duration. seven years closes his apostleship among men and wafts his faithful soul to a glory celestial. David hath fallen, did he fall alone, no about thirty of the saint because of their religion hath found one common grave and with them American liberty is buried, and cast a dark stain upon the eagles breast, Because American sons have her sons oppressed. Missouri is the first her coun trys laws to disgrace, among her bloody deeds shee's pierced an Apostle's breast with lead and stolen a valua ble life, and exterminated ten thousand saints from the state.

Several of the Brethren attended this conference that was wounded by the Missouri mob one of which I will mention which was Brother Hawns mill in upper Missouri when a large armed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles and other weapons and shot down seventeen  of the saints and murdered them in cool blood. Brother Leany flead from the midst of this seanery and while fleeing the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon him which pierced his body through and through he showed me eleven ball holes in his body their was 27 in his shirt, 7 in his pantaloons and his coat literally cut to rags. one ball entered his body at one armpit and came out at the other another entered the back and came out at the breast a ball passed through each hip through each leg and each arm all this was while he was running for life and as strange as it may appear all those wounds with one broken rib did not lessen his speed in the least but he entirely out run his enemies and saved his life. We can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power and mercy of God Brother Joseph Young was among the number he also fled and although the balls flew around him like hailstones yet he was not wounded.

I had an interview with five of the quorum of  the Twelve. We feel and believe that it is the most important period and age of the world  of any since man was upon the earth. We read with much interest the history of Israel in travling from Egypt to Canaan and search with Interest the prophesies of Isaiah and all  the prophets in the Bible the stick of Judah. But if possible there is feelings of greater  interest vibrating our bosoms on reading the Book of Mormon the stick of Joseph in the hands  of Ephraim to behold the faith manifest of Lehi, Nephi, Alma, Mormon, and Moroni and  many others I might name who obtained a promise of the Lord by faith that blessings  should rest upon there seed FIGURE JOSEH The Lamanites in the last days.

ENDENTRY June 25, 1839 ~ Tuesday   June 25 I spent the day in Orson  Hide was one of the number. and a more humble and penitant man I never saw, and well he might be for  in the time of the persecution in Zion or far west, he deserted the cause, denyed the faith and betrayed  his brethren, and assisted Thomas B. Marsh (the president of the Twelve Apostles) in jeperdizing the  lives of Joseph and his council and the whole church in Zion and the blood of the whole of them would  have been shed if they had not been spared by the immediate hand of God. Brother Hide for several  months past has had a deep scense of his high handed wickedness and the horrors of hell has roll'd  oer his soul even to the wasting of his flesh and he has now humbled himself in the dust desire ing to return to the Church. The manner that O. Hide and T. B Marsh Jepopardized the church  was by bearing fals testimony against the presidency and the church before the authorities of the  State of Governour's calling out thirty thousand  of the Militia against the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and when the Militia came  out against the church Col George M. Hinkle (an Elder in church and the one that led the saints as  they went out to stand in their own defence) sold the presidency and the whole church into the hands  of the Malitia which were determined on taking our lives, yea Hinkle proved one of the worst of  traitors that ever occupied a standing on earth yet the Lord deliverd his saints and Blessed be his name    ENDENTRY June 26, 1839 ~ Wednesday   26 I crossed the river with the Twelve to Commerce and spent the day in council with the Twelve and two of  the Presidency Rigdon expressed  his opinion vary plain and forcably, he said he feared that if Br Hide returned to his quorum that when  the next trial came he would desert the church as he had done before but said if it was the will  of God he was willing that Br Hide should return to his quorum.    Interesting remarks  were made from Ephe 1 ch 17, 18 verses. But more esspecially from St. John XIV ch 15 to 31 vers the  other comforter Note the 23 v. andc.   ENDENTRY June 27, 1839 ~ Thursday   June 27th I spent the day in Commerce in council with the Presidency and Twelve we had an interesting  day Orson Hide was restored to the church and the  quorum of the Twelve in full fellowship by a full vote of the council, after making an humble  confession and acknowledgement of his sins andc. FIGURES Among the vast number of the Keys  of the kingdom of God Joseph presented the following one to the Twelve for there benefit in there  experience and travels in the flesh which is as follows. In order to detect the devel when he transforms  himself nigh unto an angel of light. When an angel of God appears unto man face to face in personage  and reaches out his hand unto the man ^and he^ takes hold of the angels hand and feels a substance the same as one  man would in shaking hands with another he may then know that it is an angel of God, and he should  place all confidence in him such personages or angels are saints with there resurrected Bodies,  but if a personaged appears unto man and offers him his hand and the man takes hold of it and he feels  nothing or does not sens any substance he may know it is the devel, for when a saint whose body  is not resurrected appears unto man in the flesh he will not offer him his hand for this is against  the law given him and in keeping in mind these things we may detct the devil that he decieved us not.

ENDENTRY July 2, 1839 ~ Tuesday   2d THIS was an interesting day. The First Presidency Joseph and his council came across the river to  Montrose to spend the day with the Twelve to bless them and their families before they left for other  Nations. In the fore part of the day we rode four miles down the river to see the place called Blefens  point whare the saints expected to build a town, Joseph pronounced it good and we returned. the whole  company dined at my dwelling consisting of about Twelve persons after dinner we all assembled at   ENDENTRY Elder Hiram Smith opened the meeting by prayer after which the Presidency lade their hands upon my head and sealed a blessing upon me President Rigdon being speaker they also sealed a blessing upon the head of Elders Turley. Also upon the head of Sister wife. If we were faithful we had the promise of again returning to the bosom of our families and being blesed on our mission and having many souls as seals of our ministry. After the blessings were bestowed Brother Hiram Smith arose and gave The Twelve some interesting advice and council considering it best to say nothing but repentance to this generation or at least to preach the first principles of the gosepl as that was as much as this generation could endure and many other things he said of interest. Then Joseph arose and presented some precious things of the kingdom unto us in the power of the Holy Ghost, yea precious principles that ought to be engraven upon our hearts and practiced in our lives, some of which are as follows. Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy and be ready to forgive our brother on the first intimations of repentance and asking forgiveness and should we even forgive our brother or our enemy before they ask it our heavenly father would be equally as merciful unto us, and also we ought to be willing to repent of and confess all of our own sins and keep nothing back, and let the Twelve be humble and not be exalted and beware of pride and not seek to excell one above another but act for each others good and honerably make mention of each others name in our prayrs before the Lord and before our fellow men, and not backbite and devour our brother. Why will not man learn wisdom by precept and example at this late age of the world and not be oblieged to learn every thing we know by sad experiance. Must the new ones that are chosen to fill the places of those that are fallen of the quorum of the Twelve, begin to exhalt themselves untill they get so high that they will tumble over and have a great fall and go wallowing through the mud, mire, and darkness Judas like to the buffatings of Satan as several of the Twelve have done, or will they learn wisdom and be wise. (O God give them wisdom and keep them humble I pray). When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christ stands befor the congregations of the earth and they preach in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the people are asstonished and confounded at the doctrin and say that that man has preached a powerful discours a great sermon then let that man or those men take care that they do not asscribe the glory unto themselves but be careful that they are humble and asscribe the praise and glory to God and the Lamb for it is by the power of the   ENDENTRY Holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost that they have power thus to speak. What art thou O man but dust and from wholm dost thou received thy power and blessings but from God, then O ye Twelve notice this FIGURE key and be wise for Christ sake and your own souls sake. Ye are not sent out to be taught but to teach let every man be sober be vigilent and let all his words be seasoned with grace and keep in mind that it is a day of warning and not of many words. Act honest before God and man beware of gentile sophestry such as bowing and scraping unto men in wholm you have no confidence. be honest open and frank in all your intercourse with mankind O ye Twelve and all saints, profit by this important key FIGURE that in all your trials, troubles, and temptations, afflictions bonds imprisionment and death see to it that you do not betray heaven, that you do not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not betray your Brethren, and that you do not betray the revela tions of God whether in the bible, Book of Mormon, or Doctrine and Covenants or any of the word of God. yea in all your kicking, and floundering see to it that you do not this thing lest innocent blood be found in your skirts and you go down to hell. We may ever know by this sign that there is danger of our being led to a fall and aposticy, when we give way to the devil so as to neglect the first known duty but whatever you do do not betray your Friend    ENDENTRY July 4, 1839 ~ Thursday   July 4th I spent this day of Independance in assisting Brothers Taylor in preparing a peace for the first paper or NO of the Times and Seasons published in Commerce    ENDENTRY July 6, 1839 ~ Saturday   6th FIGURE I received a letter from sister Eunice dated June 15th I spent the day in aranging my trunk, clothes, Books andc. to prepare for my mission to England    ENDENTRY July 7, 1839 ~ Sunday   7th Sunday this is an important day and worthy of record because of the important scenes which transpir'd as follows. I crossed the Woodruff in company with two of the Twelve and about one hundred saints which went to Commerce from Montrose to attend a meeting that the Twelve might deliver their farewell address before they left for John E. Page was speaking he occupied the stand in the forepart of the day and spoke much upon the proof of the book of Mormon in the afternoon brother John Taylor spoke and bore testimony also of the things of God. I followed   ENDENTRY him in testimony and rejoiced in having the privilege of once more addressing the body of the church Brother Brigham Young next spoke and also bore testimony in the spirit. We was then addressed by President S. Rigdon and his address was peculiarly adapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking their leave of all they hold dear on earth and go forth from their own nation and stand before the kings and rulers of the natio- ns of the earth to bear testimony unto them of the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ his address was of such a nature in appealing to our affections, in parting with our wives, and children, and the peculiarity of our mission, the perils that we might meet with, and the blessings that we should receive, andc. that tears was brought from many eyes. Joseph addressed us in few words and says remember brethren that if you are imprisioned Brother Joseph has been imprisoned before you, if you are placed whare you can ownly see your Brethren through the grates of a window while in Irons because of the gospel of Jesus Christ remember Brother Joseph has been in like circumstances also after other similar remarks the meeting closed and three persons were Baptized and confirmed which ended the duties of the day.   REFLECTIONS Surely this is an important day to behold a quorum of Twelve Apostles of the Lamb of God organized in these last days to go forth unto all the nations of the earth to prune the vineyard once more for the last time that the saints may be prepared for the second coming of Christ, and that Israel may be gathered and babylon fall and the earth once more clensed from its pollutions and wickedness swept from the face thereof FIGURE May the Lord enable us the Twelve ever to be meek and humble and to lie passive in this hands as the clay is in the hands of the potter and may we ever realize that while we are in the service of God and doing his will, that though we may be surrounds by mobs and threatened with death that the Lord is our deliverer and that he will support us in every time of trouble and trial   ENDENTRY July 8, 1839 ~ Monday   July 8th I spent in writing.

We found quite a number that were sick several received a blessings and while administering in spiritual things Smith ^is 68 years of age this day^ and lay hands upon him that he might be healed for he was sick and nigh unto death we lade hands upon him and he received ^6 sick^ a blessing the thought struck me that the Lord would add unto his life fifteen years. and to close the scenes of this day, we received the glorious intelligence of the happy deliverence of PARLEY P. PRATT from Prision whare he had been confined seven months for the cause of God. Brother Morris Phelps was also delivered with Parley. they delivered themselves on the fourth day of July about the setting of the sun by running over the  Jailor and esscaping out of thir hands by mounting some horses that were prepared for that purpose by Phelps and others. they were closely persued by the mob and narrowly escaped by leaving behind them their horses saddles bridles and hats and arived in Quincy on the 10th of July making six days on the road. they are now all liberated but two persons viz King Follet and Luman Gibbs.
