 his commission as a messenger of peace and salvation as one of the Lord's noble men I can fervently say may the Lord clear his way before him, and bless him,and bless those that obey his teachings wherever there are ears to hear & hearts to feel. He is in the language of the Hebrews -[✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦]-(Hau-ra-ang yeesh-rau-ale) The friend of Israel and worthy to be received and entertained as a man of God: yea he has as had the ancient Apostle O'✦✦✦✦✦ O'✦✦✦✦✦(ologos ohales) the good word: that that leadeth unto eternal Life Laus Deus.

 And may health peace and the love of God our Father and the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord be and abide with you all is the sincere Prayer of your devoted brother & friend In the everlasting gospelJOSepH SmithCity of NauvooJune 1st 1843June 2, 1843 ~ Friday to June 3, 1843 ~ SaturdayJune 2 & 3 Spent the time in building my house.June 4, 1843 ~ Sunday4th Sunday I spent the time at home writingJune 5, 1843 ~ Monday to June 10, 1843 ~ Saturday5, 6, 7, 8, 9, & 10, I Spent the week labouring on my house on Saturday we got the walls of the sullar up & put on our lower Joist & were ready for the brick work but shall be under the necessity of suspending operations on the house for one week for the want of brickJune 11, 1843 ~ SundayJune 11th A large assembly of Saints met at the Temple & were addressed by President Joseph Smith. He took for the foundation of his discourse the words of Jesus to the Jews how oft would I have gatherd you togetherd as a hen gathereth her chickens under wings But ye would not &c. He then asked what was the object of Gathering the Jews together or the people of God in any age of the world, the main object was to build unto the 
 Lord an house whereby he could reveal unto his people the ordinances of his house and glories of his kingdom & teach the peoplthe ways of salvation for their are certain ordinances & principles that when they are taught and practized, must be done in a place or house built for that purpose this was purposed in the mind of God before the world was & it was for this purpose that God designed to gather together the Jews oft but they would not it is for the same purpose that God gathers together the people in the last ^days^ to build unto the Lord an house to prepare them for the ordinances & endowments washings & anointings &c one of the ordinances of the house of the Lord is Baptism for the dead, God decreed before the foundation of the world that that ordinance should be administered in a house prepared for that purpose. If a man gets the fulness of God he has to get [it] in the same way that Jesus Christ obta-ined it & that was by keeping all the ordin-ances of the house of the Lord. Men will say I will never forsake you but will stand by you at all times but the moment you teach them some of the mysteries of God that are retained in the heavens and are to be revealed to the children of men when they are prepared, They will be the first to stone you & put you to death. It was the same principle that crusified the Lord Jesus Christ. I will say sumthing about the Spirits in prision, theire has been much said about the sayings of Jesus on the cross to the thief saying this day thou shalt be with me in paradise. The commentators 
 make or translators make it out to say Paradise but what is Paradise it is a modern word it does not answer at all to the original that Jesus made use of, their is nothing in the original in any language that signif-ies Paradise. But it was this day I will be with thee in the world of spirits & will teach thee or answer thy inquiries. The thief on the cross was to be with Jesus Christ in the world of spirits he did not say Paradise or heaven. The doctrin of Baptism for the dead is clearly shown in the new testament & if the doctrin is not good then throw away the new testament but if it is the word of God then let the doctrin be acknowledged & it was one reason why Jesus said how oft would I have gatherd you (the Jews) together that they might attend to the ordinance of the baptism for the dead as well as the other ordinances the Priesthood Revelations &c. This was the case on the day of Pentecost these blessings were poured out upon the deciples, on that occasion. Their has been also much said about the word Hell & the sectarian world have preached much about it but what is hell, it is annother modern term it is taken from hades, the greek or shaole, the (hebrew) & the true sig-nification is a world of spirits, Hades shaole paradise, spirits in prision is all one it is a world of spirits, the righteous & the wicked all go to the same world of spirits 
 but says one I believe in one hell & one heaven all are equally miserable or equally happy, but St Paul informs us of three glories & three heavens he knew a man caught up to the third heavens, & Jesus said their were many mansions in my Fathers kingdom. Any man may believe Jesus Christ is good & be happy in it & yet not obey his commands & at last be cut down by his righteous commandmends A man of God should be endowed with all wisdom knowledge & understanding in order to teach & lead people. The blind may lead the blind & both fall into the deatch together;Their is much said concerning God the Godhead &c the scripture says their is Gods many & Lords many, the teachers of the day say that the father is God the son is God & the Holy Ghost is God & that they are all in one body & one God. Jesus says or prays that those that the father had given him out of the world might be made one in us as we, are one, but if they were to be stuffed into one person they would make a great God. If I were to testify that the world was wrong on this point it would be true. Peter says that Jesus Christ sat on the right hand of God any person that has seen the heavens opened knows that their is three personages in the heavens holding 
 the keys of power. As the father hath power in himself so the Son hath power, in himself then the father has some day laid down his body & taken it again ^so he has a body of his own^ So has his Son a body of his own so each one will be in their own body.Many of the sects cry out O I have the testimony of Jesus I have the spirit of God. But away with Jo Smith he says he is a Prophet But their is to be no Prophets nor revelations in the last days; But stop sir the Revelator says that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so by your own mouth you are condemned.But to the text why gather the people together in this place for the same purpose that Jesus wanted to gather the Jews, to receive the ordinances, the blessings & the glories that God has in store for his Saints. And I would now ask this assembly and all the Saints if they will now build this house & receive the ordinances & blessings which God has in store for you, or will you not build unto the Lord this house & let him pass by & bestow these blessings upon another I pause for a replyAfter Joseph closed Elder Cutler spoke concerning the Temple & also the Death of Elder Elias Higby one of the Temple Committee who Died June 8th 1843 Aged 47 years 7 month and 17 days at the close of the meeting President J. Smith gave out an appointmen for

Two messengers were immediately dispatched to inform President Joseph Smith of the above facts he was absent about 200 miles from home When will Missouri cease her ungodly persecutions against President Joseph Smith & the Saints O Lord hasten the day when the blood of Saints shall not cry from the ground in vain & when the Prophets of God shall not have to flee from the ha[n]d v I of the wicked persecutor & oppresser 
 June 19, 1843 ~ Monday19 I finished digging my well got about 4 feet of water in the rock & course gravelTheire was a meeting held by a company calling themselves labourers saying they were oppressed & manifested some spirit of mob & disrule & did not act in wisdomJune 20, 1843 ~ Tuesday20th I finished stoning my well it being about 25 feet deep.

He took grounds to prove that Charity consisted in doing that for others which they could not do for them-selves for instance Jesus Christ died to Redeem the world, the world could not Redeem itself this is Charity, if our fore fathers & Mothers & kindred have died without the gospel, & we embrace the gospel in our day & generation & can redeem our relatives By being Baptized for them they being dead that they may have part in the first resurrection, should we do this it would be Charity for we should do for 
 them what they could not do for themselvs & this was wherein The Apostle said why then are ye baptized for the dead if the dead rise not, this is far greater than faith & hope for though we might Believe ^& hope^ our friend might be redeemed yet if we was not Baptized for them they might remain in Hell & our faith & hope do them no good but to do that for another which he can do for himself is not Charity. Elder Wight made many other vary useful remarks in his discourseIn the afternoon Elder Magin addressed the meeting. But in the midst of his discours President Hiram Smith came onto the Stand & requested the Masonic fraternity to meet him at the Lodge Room in 30 minutes we immediately went down & a quarter could not Get into the Rooms we then formed a hollow square on the green. President Smith then informed us that the Sheriff of Jackson Co Missouri & Wilson of Carthage had come upon President Joseph Smith & taken him on surprise presented each of them a pistol to his breast & swore they would kill him if he made any resistance. Br Markham went to his assistance & they presented their pistols to him also & threaten his life but he approached them to knock them down they again pointed their pistols to Joseph Breast & said they would kill him if Markham approached them 
 & to save the life of Joseph he stopedthey then took Joseph into a carrage & started for Missouri they got about 10 miles & they were stoped by the inhab-itants who swore they should nok [not]carry Joseph Smith any further without giving him the chance of law & the writ of Habeas Corpus & they took out a writ against the Sherriff Reynolds & wilson of Carthage &c. & they now wanted to get a company to go to Joseph to see that He had his rights & Br Hyram called for volunteers & their was two or three hundred came out to go, the whole city flocked together they made a choice of such as they wished, General Laws & Rich went with a company of Near 100 men on horsback and about 75 or 100 on board of the Maid of Iowa, the horsmen went by Land the those on the Boat went down the River to the mouth of the Illinois & up that River to Peoria the horse company left the city abot 8 oclok in the evening & the boat untill next morning [FIGURE]June 26, 1843 ~ Monday26 Their was several Natives of the Potawatemys through Nauvoo called to see the Nauvoo House & Temple wanted to talk had no interpeter that could inte-rpet much they spoke about their great father great spirit &c they manifested a desire to see the Temple & the city said they were hungry I took them home & fed them gave them some trinklets &c 
 I had no sooner gone below than I was envel-oped in a stench the most Horrid of any thing I ever experianced it arose from the cargo which consisted of goano A kind of dung dug out of the earth brought to this country to put on to land it is supposed to have origionally been birds dung but the worst die pot I ever saw was plesant in comparrison to this stench. I lay down but my stomach was immediately so filled with the stench that it made me as sick as Death I immediately commenced vomiting which continued for five hours at times. I gag[g]ed upon an empty stomach untill I strained myself to such a degree that blood run out of my nose almost a stream. I suffered much through the night & the sailors smoked their pipes& filled the hole with tobaco smoke though this was nacious to me it was much better than the stink that arose from the cargo, And in addition to this the seas were breaking fore & aft over the boat & the boat pitching badly this with breathing the sent of the paint goano & tobaco smoke made me vomit to that degree that my sufferings were great & I thought it the most horrid night I ever spenton the water.

 May 1834Again took up our march towardsZion we continued to travel untillwe had arived within a few miles ofLiberty Clay County Missouri here wepitched our tents and remained quitea number of days on account of thegreat excitement which prevailed inconsequence of false reports which wereabroad in the land respecting us. The majority of the people or public opinion wereagainst us and even their were aboutseventy men mounted on horsebackwith firearms gathered together for theintention of comeing against ourcamp but the God of Israel frustrated their design for while they werecomeing against us the Lord rainedupon them rain and great hail sothat it was expedient for them to seekshelter from the storm and after the storm they dispersed and would not goagainst the camp. After remainingstationary for several days the leadingmen of Clay County and some principle 
 May 1834Men of other Counties called at ourcamp to enquire into our motivesand after a fair investigation of thesubject they manifested to us thatthey were satisfied that we had no evildesigns or intentions in our movements or procedings. We remained inthis situation visited daily by both friendand foes untill the High Priests held acouncil and there was a Revelation givenconcerning us. By this time the excitement had in a great measureceased and the Lord had granted usfavour in the eyes of the people. Wenow again prepared ourselves to move forward we traveled till within abouttwo miles of Liberty then we againpitched our tents near by the house ofBrother Burqett's here we remainedfor several days. and while here Iwitnessed a solemn scene previousto this time while on our journey therewere disobedience and murmuringsin the camp And Brother Joseph prophesied 
 May 1834That in consequence of these thingsthere was a scourge awaited the CampAnd as it was prophesied of so it wasfulfilled for soon after we had camped by Brother Burkjetts we werevisited by the destroying angel and 8or 10 of our brethren were immediatelylade helpless beneath the stroke[.] I assistedin taking care of them through the dayand the night following and throughthe night and in the morning therecontinued to be new attacks. And in the morning Joseph remarkedthat it was the duty of the Camp to brakeup and disperse and take up their abodearound among the brethren lest the Scourge should be more severe. A reserve was made however for ^a^ sufficientnumber to tarry to take care of thesick. Accordingly the camp dispersed.And Brother Seth Hitchcock was oneof the number attacked with sicknessand he belonging to our tent it requeired another of our tent to take care of him 
 And it was inconvenient for me tostay to take care of him in consequence of having a teem [of animals] to see to. Andby request of Brother HitchcockBrother Seth Ingols remained totake care of him. I left the camp ground and traveled about 7 miles to Brother Lawery's[Printed between lines of cursive text] in Company with Elder Holmes whospent the summer with me at Elder L Wightshouse and remained with him for several days. I soon began tohear of the deaths of my Brethren whichI left sick they all died which werefirst taken and numbers which wereafterwards attacked there were about 20in the whole which died at or about thattime. Brother ^Seth^ Hitchcock and Seth ^Warren^ Ingolswere among the number. Brother Ingolshad been in company with me fromthe time I left my brothers Azmonat Richland N.Y.

Andit is a great benefit to the inquireingmind to be privileged of attending thesecounsels as it is the privilege of the Council to recieve the word of the Lord concerning all subjects that are broughtbefore them to be decided or investigatedthat immediately concern the church 
 On points of the gospel. And infine those councils which God hath appointed in these last days are in the firstdegree the most instructive and interesting to the honest enquirer after truthlight and intelligence that this generationof the human family hath access to.I continued to labour witha number of my Brethren at Brother Wight'sthrough the summer and fall. We hadpreaching occasionally through the summerfrom persons who were appointed by thecouncil to teach. And seperate from thosemeetings the branch of the Church by BrotherLyman Wight's met together at hishouse on the Sabbath for the purpose ofbreaking bread and exhorting one anotherIt was a practice for any who was to beordained to the ministry to have the voiceof the branch of the Church in which theywere living before they were recommendedto the high Council for ordination.It was at one of these meetings thatI wrote 12 Letters While holding the Office of A Teacher 
 November 5th 1834Brother Lyman Wight called a voteto recommend Brother Stephen Winchester, Heman T Hide and myself to thehigh council for ordination it was afull vote and at the next meeting of thehigh council we were recommendedby Lyman Wight, Amasa LymanElias Higby and Zebedee Colton allhigh priests to the council and there wasa vote taken and carried by the highcouncil to ordain us priests.

Sarah Elizabeth was taken wors & began to sink vary fast, they gave her medicine but she was much distressed & they thought mortification had taken place

Mrs Woodruff and myself went up as soon as could, & when we arived at the house we found Sarah Elizabeth apparently dying and appeared as though she would not live 10 minutes. Sister Foss & Ira Foss her oldest son was vary sick. the family was taking medicine after the Thompsonian system viz roots & herbs threedoctors were attending upon the family, it was difficult to tell what the fever was that they had, it was first called the Typhus fever, but it proved to be vary malignant if not a putrid fever, the doctors nurses, & watchers, were nearly all more or less affe[c]ted with it that were in the midst of it. the tongue would turn black & in a low stage would swell. it seemed to be a difficult matter to break up the fever after it once seated. but to returne to the subject of Eliza-beth, Doctor Churchell came from Saco, to see Elizabeth, when he saw her he said it was of no use to give her any thing for she would soon go. he gave some council concerning the rest of the sick, & thought preperations had better be made for removing the corps as soon as the bre^a^th left the body & not have it remain in the room with the rest of the sick. and after standing by Sarah Elizabeth Foss for two hours to see the last breath leave the body, expecting evry moment would be the last as she breathed shorter and shorter her puls all of a treamor, spots appeared on the surface like mortification her eyes were closed, her tongue black as a coal & swollen some out of her mouth. I spent an hour preparing a place to lay her out moving beds bedsteads &c. when all of a sudden things took aturn with her she opened her eyes, had her reason 
 well could talk her puls became regular, we ceased all further preperations for laying her out. A slight emetic was given her, ^&^ ◊injections with a portions of charcoal, to kill mortification. her body was washed all over will [with] Alkilie of salaratus she vomited black stuff that looked like mortification or that it cone [come]from the liver she appeared better through the day. Doctors Churchel & George Sewell were both asstonished at her being alive on their return they continued to do what they could for her. She said she thought she should get well. but was willing to die and go to rest if it was the will of God. Sister Foss was vary calm but sick felt resigned concerning Elizabeth. & vary calmly gave the children some council concerning domestic affairs if she should not live, herself, in the evening Mrs Woodruff & myself returned to Fathers Carters & spent the nightduring the night Sarah Elizabeth had an immens quantity of black matter come from her which had the appearance of the affect of Mortification. it appeared difficult to decide whether her revival was a revival before death or whether it was a turn of the fever some believed she would get well while others believed she could not but time will soon decideI dreamed of being in  Nauvoo Br Kimball {going to} England Br Wedster{denied the faith} my sister Eunice {left in the hands} of Elder YoungNovember 15, 1844 ~ Friday15th Sarah Elizabeth is alive this morning.

Young & H. C. Kimball The following are short extracts from the History of the TOWER OF LONDONThe Tower is situated on the east side of the city, about eight hundred yayrds from London bridge near the bank of the River Thames. This imp-ressive edifice, at first consisted of no more than what at present is called the white Tower, and with-out any authority, has been reported to have been built by JULIUS CÆSAR, though there is the strongestevidence of its being marked out, and a part of it first erected by William the Conqueror, in the year  - - 1078 [FIGURES] It contains three Batteries, the first iscalled the Devils Battery, second Stone Battery third Wooden Battery mounted with Cann. [FIGURES]The Tower was a Palace during five hundred years, and ownly ceased to be so on the accession of Queen Elizabeth. Here observes Mr Penant,"fell the meek usurper Henry VI by the dagger of the Profligate Gloucester. Here full of horrors died by the hands of hired ruffians, the unsteady Clarance. who can read without Shuddering his dreadful dream, which Shakespear makes him relate to the Lieutenant's (Richard III. Act 1. Scene 4th.). And here the sweet innocents Edward VI and his brother the Duke of York fell victi-ms to the violent ambition of there remoseless uncle." The Principal buildings are the church, the white Tower, Governors House the Bloody Tower, the Offices of Ordnance of the keepers of the Records, the Jewel Office the Hors Armoury, Queen Elizabeth's Armoury 
 the grand Store House in which is the Small Arm Armoury, the train of Artillery, and the tent room; the New Store House, wharein are three Store Roomns's. Houses for the chief and infer-ior Officers. the Mess House for the Officers of the Garrison, and the Barracks, for the Soldiers. In addition to those there is a street called the Mint which includes nearly one third part of the Tower. The principal part of the houses were formerly in-habited by the Officers employed in the coinage, but now principally by the Military, Government having erect-ed a vary extensive and majestic structure to the north of Little Tower Hill, for the business of the Mint department, with houses for those officersThe Grand Storehouse is north of the white Tower, a fine building of brick and hewn stones; it extends in length 345 feet, and is 60 feet broad, it was commenced by James II and finished by William III. On the first floor of this edifice is that magnifficent room called the Small Armoury, in which he, with Queen Mary his Consort, dined in great state haveing all the warrent workmen and labourers to attend them, dressed in white gloves & aprons. THE HORSE ARMOURY.Here in one spacious room, 150 feet by 33 are arranged in regular and chronological order, no less a number than twenty two equestrian figures, comprising many of the most celebrated kings of England accompanied by their favorite Lords and men of rank, all of them, together with their horses in the armour of the respective periods when they flourished, many, indeed, in the identical suits in which they appeared while living. Along the centre of the ceiling immediately over each figure is a gothic arch in the centre of which is suspended a banner which in gold letters on both sides, expres-ses the name, rank, and date of existence of the personage represented. The horses stand, mounted by their riders, almost without any visible supp-ort on a floor of brick raised a little from the adj-oining doarded flooring which is appropriated to the spectators. 1. EDWARD. I. King of England AD 1272. The armour of this figure consists of the hawberk and its sleeves of mail, the hood & chau-sses of the same material.

King of England AD. 1508. This is a fluted suit of elegant form probably of German manufacture5. Henry VIII. King of England AD. 1520. This monarch appears in a suit of plate armour gilt. [FIGURE] It is impossible to give a just summary of this prince's qualities, he was so different from himse-lf in the several periods of his life. [FIGURE] In his youth he was sincere, open, gallant, and liberal; in his more advanced years, he became rapacious, arbitrary, violent, superstitious, obstinate, unjust and cruel. He had six wives. After he had been married 20 years to the first, he grew weary of her, and from a pretended scruple of conscience, put her away. His second wife, the incomparable Queen Ann Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth, he beheaded upon slight ground of jealousy. He was weary of the third as soon as soon as he was married to her. The immature death of the fourth, perhaps prevented an untimely one. The fifth was beheaded as her predecessor Queen Annewas, though less innocent than Queen Ann of the crime for which she suffered. The Sixth Queen Catherine parr was a most religious lady, and was so able a christian, that she had nearly disputed her head off. Had the King lived a little longer he would probably have made a new choice. But he died Janury 28th1547, after a reign 37 years and 9 months, and in the 56th years of his age6. Charles Brandon. Duke of Suffolk 1520. He also Is represented in plate armour.7. Edward Clinton Earl of Lincoln AD 1535. This noblemans armour is vary elegantly gilt. and his right hand rests on a mace. He w^e^ars a long fluted sword. 8. Edward VI. King of England AD 1552. This figure is particularly desierving of notice both on a[c]count of its armour, which is what was termed russet and gilt in the most curious manner throughout & also for the fine Attitude in which it is placed.

 Jan 21st Sunday [FIGURE] A large assembly of Saints met at the Temple and herd an interesting discours delivered by President Joseph Smith.

Their are many people assembled here to day & throughout this city, & from various parts of the world who say that they have recieved to a certaintya portion of knowledge from God by revelationin the way that he has ordained & pointed outI shall take the broad ground then that if we have or can receive a portion of knowledgefrom God by immediate revelation by the same source we can receive all knowledge. What shall I talk about today[?] I know what Br Cahoon wants me to speak about, he wants me to speak about the comeing of Elijah in the last days I can see it in his eye. I will speak upon that subject then. The Bible says "I will send you Elijah before the great & dredful day of the Lord come that he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children & the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come & smite the whole earth with a curse." Now the word turn here should be translated -[bind or seal]- But what is the object of this important mission or how is it to be fulfilled.

O God, thy will be done.} 
 past and gone and at times it seemed as though all earth & hell were combined to crush her troubled soulI began to cry unto God that she might be supported under these & all other trials. & I soon found that the samespirit which had inspired her to imbrace the fullness of the gospel & forsake her friends & go a journey of 1000miles to enjoy the society of the saints & had united her heart & hand with my own & caused her to accom-pany me to the Islands of the sea, was with HER STILL. Yes PHEBE possesses to much firmness, & faith in God& confidence in God to put her hand to the plough & look back or to wholey give way to such trials & any other howev[er]great. She is determined, like Ruth, to forsake her kindred & country for Christ's sake & my own & the causein which she is ingaged, & as I behold this principle beaming in her daily walk, heart & countenance it binds mywhole soul to her in love stronger than death or the bars of a castle, yes that love that none partakes of exceptthose in like circumstances, and that man that will not love his wife with all his heart after she has made such asacrifice for his sake is not worthy of a companion or a standing in human society. And O ye ungodly gentilesthat would laugh at a man for considering such a wife the greatest temporal blessing that heaven could bestowye are more fit for the society of Demons than a virtuous woman. The devel has never temptedme to scease from doing the will of God by gathering to Zion or to scease travling & preaching the gospel, by presenting before my my friends & telling me to stay & enjoy their society for in doing thus I might ruing both myself& friends I would sooner say to him get the[e] behind me satan for I would go to the land of Zion or where everGod sent if I had to forsake as many fathers, mothers, brothers & sisters as could stand between Maine &Missouri & subsist upon boiled herbs on the way. Father & Mother Carter with all the Brothersand sisters appertaining to the household, have been uncommonly attentive, kind, & generous to us both duringthe last year that we have been with them, although they do not see the propriety of our gathering with theSaints to Zion in order to escape the judgments of God, yet my prayer to God is that they may not loose theirreward for their uncommon kindness towards us but may yet have their eyes open to understand thecommandments of God concerning Zion in the last days & flee unto it for reffuge themselves & obtain arighteous inheritance there while the judgments of God are resting upon the gentiles & may they also havepart in the first resurrection & finally obtain a celestial glory which is my prayer through JESUS CHRIST 
 September 12, 1838 ~ WednesdaySept 12th I spent the day at father Carters in packing up the last remains of our goods I carriedthe most of our goods to Sister Sarah Foss's whare the saints or camp will spend the night whenthey arive. Icabod C. Foss was expecting to go to Zion with us he is a son of sister Sarah Foss butold Mr Foss opposed him to such a degree that it was thought best for him to tarry.September 13, 1838 ~ Thursday13 We have had a hard rain during the day. Besides many favorers bestowed upon us from father Carter he gave Phebe one hundred dollars for which sum we both signed an article or writingthat we were satisfied & would hold no further claim to any of his real estate or personal propertySeptember 14, 1838 ~ Friday14th I accompanied Father Carter & Brother Fabyan, with Abial Carter & Timothy Roth & some others in afish boat out into the bay for a fishing tour. the morning was pleasent after the storm but a highsea we dug a quantity of clams for bait & launched forth into the deep, after beating two mileswe hove to, cast anchor & caught a small quantity of fish mostly Haddock's we then sailed to apoint of Land & built up a fire hung on a pot, fried out some pork & dressed 6 Haddock & one Hake& put them into the pot we sliced in some popatoes & put in a quantity of crackers & by adding someseasoning & boiling it untill it was thoroughly cooked it formed as rich a dish as would be necessaryto set before a King, this kind of a dish is what seaman or fisherman call a chouder we all satdown & ate uncommonly hearty, useing clam shells for knives, forks, & spoons, after finishing our feastwe again went out about a mile from shore & spent several hours more in fishing, we caught agreat variety of fish such as Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Mackerel, Cunner, Flounders, Sculpin, pout,& Skate, &c. We hoisted sail & started for home about the siting of the sun we arived at fatherCarters about 8 oclock PM & spent the night. Our babe passed a sick night with the Hooping cough. 20 mSeptember 15, 1838 ~ Saturday15 My mind is in some suspens because the camp does not arive from the Islands neither do I hear any thin[g]from them by letter the time has past for them to have arived however I am looking for them dailyI spent part of the day in writing while most of the household have gone to the beach for a morningsride. I have this morning receieved the returns of the late Election throughout the state of Maine. Mr Fairfield thedemocratic candidate is elected Governor over Mr Kent by about 4000 majority 
 September 16, 1838 ~ SundaySept 16 Sunday I rode in company with Brother Fabyan Carter to Buxton & spent the day with Elder Towns-end we returned to Scarborough I spent the night at Sister Sarah Foss's distance of the day 20 milesSeptember 17, 1838 ~ Monday17 I spent the day at Father Carters reading the life of Lorenzo DowSeptember 18, 1838 ~ Tuesday18 [FIGURE] I receieved a letter from Brother Nathaniel Thomas dated Sept 12 they had not yet started theyhad been delayed in waiting for some that were not ready [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Brother ThomasI also wrote a letter to [FIGURE] Elder Milton Holmes I spent the night at father Carters. WE have atotal eclipse of the sun this day commencing about 3 oclock PM & visibleSeptember 19, 1838 ~ Wednesday to September 20, 1838 ~ Thursday19 Spent the day at Father Carters. Also the 20September 21, 1838 ~ Friday21 [FIGURE] I receieved a letter from Priest Thomas he informed me the camp would be ready to startin few days. he wished me to pray to God to deliver them & enable them to go out of Babylon. Trulywe all need patience & faith in God. for it is a day of temptation, trials, & trouble for the devil is exced-ing mad because the saints are beginning to gather out from the midst of the gentiles & go unto the landof Zion. I wrode to Buxton to see Elder James Townsend to get him to go to the land of Zion with us& after having an interview with him he concluded to go with us I called upon Mr William Harman& bargined for a two horse waggon on conditions. I returned & spent the night at father Carters {Distance} 20 mSeptember 22, 1838 ~ Saturday22 The sun is crossing the line about these days. we are visited with a storm of rain to day the weather is warmI am still at father Carters & much desirous to see the Camp of the Saints. Our babe is recovering fromthe Hooping cough, may its life be preserved I Pray if it is the will of the LordSeptember 23, 1838 ~ Sunday23 Sunday I spent the day at Father CartersSeptember 24, 1838 ~ Monday24 I saw a report in the Portland Transcrip against the Mormons -[Saints]- in Davis County Mowhich arose on the day of the election in consequence of our Brethren enjoying their privilegeas American Citizens by casting their vote & that numbers were rising up among the gentiles ofthe different Counties to go over to Davis County to mob the Saints all these reports & storieshave a tendency to dampen & discourage the minds & feelings of many [of] the saints that are gatheri-ng to Zion. But none of these things moove me I am determined to overcome, keep the faith & go to Zion 
 September 25, 1838 ~ TuesdaySept 25. O Lord give me faith, grace, & patience to endure what is lade upon ^me^ without murmering orcomplaining, help me to be resigned to thy will in all things. The report that I spoke of yesterday concerningthe Mormon's in Mo as the saints are called, is going the rounds today among our friends & neighbo-urs; this one is saying it wont do to go & that is saying it will not do to go for you will be killed&c. But O, fools, slow at heart to believe that God is as able to protect his saints in theselast days from the hands of the gentiles as HE was anciently to deliver Israel from the EgyptiansThose things are the smallest part of my trials & suspens that is resting upon my mind at thistime. My trials are as great about these days as at any time since I have been a member of the churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. If any inquires what my trials are, should they ask if I wasdoubting the cause in which I am ingaged, I can answer in truth NO, God forbid[.] I never was a strongerMormon Saint than about these days. What is the matter then, I'll" tell you: The Lord has commandedme to go to Zion spedily & while I am setting myself myself about it the devel with all his agents areusing their combined exertions & power to hinder me. I have been waiting for the saints from theIslands of the sea to accompany them to that land untill it is vary late, the fall rains are upon us, coldweather will soon encircle us, the minds of the saints are depressed & cast down around me, we havea dreary journey of two thousands miles before us with no other expectation but to camp upon the groundI have a sick infant of two month's old to take with us & a wife whose spirits at times are muchdepressed under such [illegible] ^severe^ trials But thank God she stands the shock like a brave soldier whichis great consolation to my soul. The above are some of the trials that are resting upon me. But Ican say get the[e] behind me Satan for I say in the name of Jesus Christ that I will stand in the landwhare God has commanded me to gather unto before another spring rolls over my head if it is onfoot & alone & I beg my bread by the way. So now rage on thou foul monster untill thou art stopedin thy mad career at the end of thy chain given thee by the angel of God & see who will gain thevictory. I spent the day at father Carters gathering apples I saved some apple seeds from hisorcherd to plant in Zion 
 September 26, 1838 ~ WednesdaySept 26th I rode to Elder James Townsend. I procured a two horse waggon of Mr William Harmon {for SisterSarah Foss} & drew it to sister Sarah Foss's Elder Townsend returned with me distance of the day 20 mSeptember 27, 1838 ~ Thursday27th It is a dark cold rainy day & gloomy also, & what makes it more so the Camp of the Saints do not geta long from the east yet, & I have not herd any thing from them for several days. But may the Lord give mepatience that I may be resigned in all things. Notwithstanding the cold rain I harnessed up my horse & carried Brother Townsend home, & assisted him in packing up his houshold goods to the amount of about 600 lbsI took the goods in my waggon & carried them to Sister Sarah Foss's house that we might be ready when the campcame along: Elder Townsend has been cast down in his mind for several days & could scarcely get faith enough toprepare himself & family to start for Zion thinking the way did not look as clear & bright as he wished to see it.But I have encouraged him from day to day; as we must walk by faith not by sight, untill he is now preparing him-self & family to go, may the Lord bless him. We must all have our faith tried before we are prepared for a celestialkingdom & "faith without works is dead being alone." I do not know when my faith will begin to be tried if it hasnot already been esspecially of late, But I thank the LORD that HE has thus far enabled me to keep the faith & withs--tand every opposition. I desire to be humble unto the end. I spent the night at father Carters. Phebe appears resign-ed to the will of the Lord in all her troubles & tribulations. It is great consolation to my soul to see her determined tomaintain her integrity unto the end. How good it is to have a help meet in every time of need. Distance 20 milSeptember 28, 1838 ~ Friday28th Glory to God I have this morning taken a letter out of the office from our Beloved Brother Nathaniel Thomas in Camdenthe letter was [FIGURE] Dated Camden Sept 26. he says "We are almost ready we shall start tomorrow morning, tellBrother Townsend to hold himself ready to go with us &c" May the Lord bless them & hasten them on their journey Ipray.

 [FIGURE] ASAHEL H. WOODRUFFDIED at Terre Haute I.a.Oct 18th 1838AGED 24 YearsAnd is he gone, has asahel fled away, from lif's fair scenes to the regions of the DEADYes he is gone by deaths relentless hand. Had youth, or beauty, friends or virtue, power to saveHe now might be mingling with his friends, and not sleeping in the silent GRAVEThere is nothing calculated to sooner lead the mind to serious & solumn meditations &to bring fresh to our memory the events of our past lives than to visit the tomb ofthose that are made dear to us by the ties of nature, of friendship, or of the blood of CHRIST.Brother Asahel was a young man of the most brilliant talents, firm & independant inindependant in his principles. I had not been privileged with a personal interview with himfor about seven years but had corresponded together by letter. Asahel had a peculiar art inletter writing which gave much interest to all the productions of his pen. We both hadlong anticipated much upon an interview with each other but my hopes were suddenly blasted. Idid not hear of his death untill the day previous to my arival at his dwelling. But I say the willof the Lord be done all is right I feel resigned 
 O death thy stroke is sure. At an early hour thyvictim's fallen, & blasted the fond hopes of a fathera mother & an ownly sister. Eunice be still & knowthat GOD hath spoken, & thy Brother called. Asahellived for thee: for thee he plan'd, he toiled, & hoped, & airycastles built for thy future joy, but now he's gone. Hisgrave remains to be wattered ownly by the Dews of hea-ven unless upon the Wabash banks a friend should chan-ce to roam & drop an accidental tear. O Asahel amongstrangers thy lot was cast among them thou hast fallen& found a grave. No friend to see thy grief or share thy joyor drop a tear with thee. Willford & Phebe alone markedthy silent bed & ownly could take a pebble in memoryof thy noble soul. A pebble did I say, ah thy books, thy Journals,thy letters, & all the productions of thy pen, are standingmonuments of thy worth & of more value to thy friendsthan the gold of Opher or the rubies of Peru. In the mornof thy days thou hast fallen yet the events of thy youth willbe active in the memory of thy friends while memory livesMethinks the spirit steals across my breast & says be still& learn to be resigned & feel that with thy brother all is wellthat what was not accomplished with him in time, will befinished when COLOB'S walls he stands clothed withImmortality. God is just, all is right. In the morn of hisdays Asahel is called from the scenes of time that hisnoble soul may see, feel, & view those glories which arehid behind the vale the covering of eternity. FarewellAsahel farewell. No more will thy voice the ears of thy friendssalute or thy pen their hearts unlock, while here in time, truthunsuled before the now are living realities, while Willford's testi-mony to thee in its true light can now be weighed. Upon theenature hath bestowed her bounty but not in vain thoughburied from human view, then sleep untill the trumpshall sound to call the[e] forth in eternal things to act.Eunice dry thy startling tear & give thy brother up. TheLord hath taken him to save his soul that earthly snaresshould not his feet enwrap & his fall secure. It speaks inlanguage loud be ye also ready, for in such an hour asye think not the son of man cometh. How solumn topart with friends yet it sweetens death to know ourfriend is God & the rest of saints our home. Then sleepAsahel sleep let naught thy dust disturd untill reanimated by the Arkangels trump & in immortals gateto meet thy friends & walk in paths of eternal light &truth & comprehend all knowledge & wisdoms space& natuers laws that ever live in vast DOMAIN 
 December 13, 1838 ~ ThursdayDec 13th This was a solemn Day to me. I spent most of the day in inquiring into & attending to the business & affairsof Brother ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF Deceased. Messrs R. A. Smith & Martin Ray the administrator & clerk of BrotherAsahel informed me that Brother Asahel Died at 3 oclock in the morning on the 18th of Oct 1838 & that he wassick 10 days & deprived of his reason 4 days before his death. his mind while delireous was principly upon his businessbut occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was the congestive fever on the brain Martin Ray had been inhis employ two months was with him through all his sickness & death they informed me that they consideredhim some absent minded or his mind deeply exercised upon some subject unbeknown to them for several monthsbefore his death. they were not as well acquainted with this matter as I was myself for I was intimatelycorresponding with him by letter & I know from his communications that his mind was deeply interestedin the subject of the gospel of Jesus Christ or the fulness of it & the cause of the church of Latter DaySaints. They also informed me that he was moral in his life temperat in practice Beloved & honoured asa citizen & his loss deeply felt. His entire stock of Books with all personal property was sold at the Administratorsale on the 4th of Dec amounting to about $3000 dollars. All of his private letters, Journals, writing, papersaccount Books & his pocket watch, penknife, pencil, letter stamp, bosom pin, silver thimble, & some other small thingswere reserved & I took them into my possession to preserve for his Mother & ownly Sister & friends untill I canhave an opportunity to convey them unto them. While looking over Asahels letters I found all that I sent himcarefully filed with other communications from his friends After attending to the above affairs I visited myBrother grave [FIGURE] A.H.W. accompanied ownly by my wife & Mr Ray I viewed it, & it looked lonely indeed.
