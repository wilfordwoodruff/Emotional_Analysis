But as I feel a great interest for your prosperyts prosperity Salvation and Eternal interest of all my relatives I wish you would read the Messenger and Advocate the paper published at Kirtland Ohio inasmuch as you have time and opportunity by that you will in some degree have if a chance of investigating the subject. I send our Parents the paper Brother Asahel when we take into consideration the Ancient order of them and compare it with the presant generation on what ground do they stand whare is that principelds Holiness.

In fact the faith of the Church of Christ of latter day saints has not ben sufficient amid such a world of unbelief to perform many great miracles The sick have been healed and speaking and interpeting other tongues are common but thanks be to God if the Church continues to go from grace to grace and from faith to faith it will soon lack no good gift and as the Lord is the same in time and in eternity yesterday to day and forever if we as saints are pure before him what Enoch saw we can see what Moses did we can do what  Peter had we can have what the saints endured, we can endure and what the righteous receieve we shall receieve.

I should have answered your letter immediately but was expecting to come immediately and therefore thought it unecessary as I though I should get here nearly as soon as a letter but I was detained many days longer than I expected to be. There was something ^said^ by some of the brethren about your returning to this place again before we went to Maine but they could not realy tell what therefore I am calculateing to start next saturday for Farmington if you think of comeing come before that time if you can. The brethren ^are^ anxious to have me stop and make a visit which I havecluded have concluded to do so as to rest myself as I was much fatigued when I arrived here. br Give my respects to brother Hale and tell him that his family are well but his wife did not write by me for want of time but sends a message by me to him which I will deliver when I see him. I do not ENDENTRY mention particulars as I hope soon to see you and can then tell you more than I could write at present as I am in great haste and am writing almost upon the run so as to mail my letter to night. I did not have to do as I told you I was intended to when I arrived here for sister Smith knew me at the first sight. all the brethren and sisters are verry kind indeed. Brother Joseph Smith has been verry sick but is recovering now.  I remain yours affectionately as ever P. W. C. Woodruff  N. B. Dont let any one see this for such looking letter for I am in great haste and have a bad pen and no Willford to mend it. so I must bid you good eve, and fold my letter and take another journey before I see you I expect.  ^HUDSON^  Should you write a line direct it to Norfolk Post office ENDENTRY Mr. Willford Woodruff Farmington Hartford County Connecticut  Norfolk Ct) July 10th)  Wilford Woodruff Phebe W. Woodruff July 9th 1837 ENDENTRY Scarborough  Aug. 5th. 1837  Dear Willford  I have sent to the Office a number of times since you left here hopeing and almost fearing that I should receive a line from you. I say fearing lest it would say that you was not about returning as I have been pleaseing myselfe with the I idea that I should soon see you again although I have felt anxious even to hear from. If you reco^l^lect you mentioned not writing if your stay was short–but let me say that your epistle came to hand last eve and met with a pleasing reception. I perused its contents and was truly rejoiced to hear of your good health and spirits likewise of your prosperity in the cause of Christ and that the Spirit of God attended you and brother Hale and opened the way before you booth temporally and spiritually as I felt verry anxious about you knowing your circumstances and that your temporal meanes were verry limited. Well we will acknowedge this to be another proof that the Lord is not unmindful of his servants and all that put their trust in him. He is able and will give us that which is best for us, although the way seames verry dark before us sometimes, yet he sees fa^r^ther than we do.  After reading your letter I felt encouraged and satisfied to have you about your masters business although I have felt some lonely and would like much to see you and enjoy your company, yet I think that it will be much better for us both to be in the place appointed to us by God, if it is to be separated a while than to be elsewhere.  Willford I per- cieve that the day is at hand when the salvation of souls and a seat in the celestial kingdom of God will be of more value than the shining ore which many spend their whole time and talents in persuite of in this life– therefore I hope that you will ever be diligent in keeping the commands of God and in dischargeing your duty fai- thfully to this generation that you may be the sooner discharged from your warfare and be permited to dwell (with one in whose affections you share largely) in peace and with the approbation of heaven saying “I have fought the good fight I have finised my course I have kept the faith” andcand. If we seek first the kingdon of heaven we have the promis of all things being added to us–yet my heart will sometime distrust providence I then take a review of the dealings of God towards me and the promises left on reco- rd for those who keep the commands of God. this stimulates me to diligence and persevereance and to try to endure to the end and then obtain a crown which I trust is laid up for me if faithful. I find it to be rather hard liveing here spir- itually as there is much darkness and opposition in these regions but my faith is as strong in the gospel of Christ as ever and I think if I keep close to the rod of iron ENDENTRY I shall get through. It is a verry darke time here now–it appeares as though every ones heart is closely shut against the truth in this place and H. Harmond is as bus^i^y as a bee in the summer in putting down mormonism as he calls it he says he is determined to put it down–Yet I rejoice that the hearts of some are open to receive the truth even on the Islands of the sea and pray the Father of Heaven that you may have many souls as seales of your ministry. Believe me Willford I have not forgotten you or brother Hale once ^since you left^ when alone before God but asked him to open the hearts of the people to administer to your temporal wants and give you access to their hearts that you ^might^ speak the words of life to them and receive it. I am pleased with brother Hales prosperity as it is some ^thing^ more new to him to travel and pr^e^ach than for you. Kirtland that he would not hold one meeting alone this summer, thus we see that he was mistaken and I rejoice in it. I think that he will make a mighty man for God if faithful.  You mentioned something about letters comeing to the Office for you I have taken out two one from Mother Asahel H. Woodruff from Farmington, it was taken out there and then remailed and then remailed and sent to Scarborough. Mother Woodruff mentions the reception of your letter–the bank note and the bowl of bread and milk w^i^ths with which you was favoured on a day of your journey–thinks the promis not made void that as thy day thy strength shall be says that the health of her family is good or that hers is not quite as good as when we was there. she says that she was about to write to Aunt Betsey came into the house and her mother soon followed her. says they came away in haste hopeing to see you again–says it was her intention to have been baptized had you been there. Mother told her she was in hopes to see you again this fall. she has written to Azmonds’ family and to Asahel and say’s her sheet was well filled she gave the particulars of your visit with them and the reception you met with among your relat^i^ves. she says that she wrote something to Azmond and Elisabeth by request of sister Coysett the substa purport was this, that from an interview with you she believed you to be right and engaged in a glorious work. and Uncle Ezra was much di^s^appoint ed in not seeing you and hearing your discourse at uncle Adner’s as he did not hear of it before it was to late. Mrs. Alling called on her (Mother) recently she said that her mind and heart was open in view of this subject. Uncle Ozem has lost a child of late. As her letter was lengthy I have just given you a few items and preserve the original for your perusal when you return. also of Asahel’s he mentions the ENDENTRY reception of your of your letter dated at Farmington and makes many friendly remarks upon the subjects of friendship connections mormonisn andcandc. We have received a paper of late from Kirtland–there was not particular news in it accepting that the inhabitants of the Citty far West had chosen 2 Judges 14 Justices of peace and established a post Office. Therefore I fear that your letter will get lost by the Office being in another place. I finished that letter which you commenced to Aphia the next sabbath and sent it. Tell brother Hale that there was a letter came to the Office for him a day or two after he left here. I will now forward it to hime with this. The health of our family is good with the acception of Mother’s and I think her much better than when you left, she wishes to be remembered to you. I have been quite unwell one day and night of late but have far recovered. sister Rhoda expe- cts to be change her situat^i^on in life next month. brother Fabyan and wife send their best respects to you likewise allof the family. You said that you felt easey about me well I am receiving every kindness that my fathers house can afford. I have been spend ing some time with sister Toronsen works just above there–he called on us Sabbath afternoon and spent the eve with us–we had a little prayer meeting which seamed quite encourageing. I feal that I am almost alone spiritually therefore I hope that you and brother Hale will continue to pray for me for I feal that I nead the prayes of all who have access to the t^h^rone of grace–You shall have mine. When the eve twilight comes Phebe wishes that she could see and converse with you for a few moments at least, but she cannot at present–she can retire in private and ask the Father to keep and presere you and give you wisdom knowledge understanding and strength equal to your day. I hope that you will be faithful and that all the people on the Island will be wise in time to secure their salvation. Was I near you I should like much to go to meeting with you occasionally. You requested me not to send any letters to brother ^H.^ if they come to this oOffice after the 15th. of this month and that you should come in about 2 months are you expecting to stay longer than he does.

It is true we have a great warfare to accomplish in order to over- come, the power of the enemy is greater than some suppose. It has already required God with the armies of heaven to wage war with him that Satan might be cast down with his influence. If so then we have strong powers to contend with but with the assistance of God we likewise will overcome. I feel not at all discouraged my way is onward. I am detemined to run the race (by the help of God) that I may win the prize for myself and family. When I meditate upon the dealings of providence with us both since our connexion, the manner in which he has delivered us from the power of the Enemy, and saved us from the jaws of Death, and supported us in the midst of trials of the keenest nature, I still feel disposed to trust in his name, rely upon his word and seorve serve him unto the end. O! may the Lord bless thee, comfort and support thy soul untill thou art perfected in Christ Jesus; (do not fail to write me as soon as you get this, tell me all the news. are you in your new house and comfortable. has Sister Taylor if so whare is he, give my respets to her But while all nature is wraped in midnight darkness I lay down my pen and retire to rest and think of thee.

My Dear Phebe  While seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusal May grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, and patience and resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father and our LORD JESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter when I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my voyage and travels since I left New York to the present time, and then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839 in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular packet ship of the New York and Liverpool line. viz Elders Turley and myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock and moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass and set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat. She had on board 15 cabin and 64 steerage passengers and Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter and 26 sailors, making 109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind and sail well. 21st stift breeze and fair wind most all on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, and myself some sick, a high wind through the day and a high gale at night, Boat rocked and pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough and winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high and as rough as the Hills and valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, and I got vary wet, and as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, and though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose and we sailed well 26th A rough sea and strong Breeze. 27th fair winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black fish and porposes. 29th pleasant morning and high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi- culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, and trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This with the noise of the Officers, and sailors reefing and taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds and rushing waves made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing Pillows which are magestic) for one is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, and must be crouded thick together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm andc. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along rough sea, blustering, cloudy, and high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair and good breeze sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her with great speed. 4th Fair weather and wind, stiff Breeze and fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs and sheep on board. 5th rough sea, high winds, and rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm and pleasant evening which we spent on deck viewing the stars and Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy and cold. smooth sea and fair breeze. We are about enter- ing the St George’s channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle and after straining our eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20 days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish coast, and also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, and rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light houses andc. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side ^the^ coast and^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle and noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds and waves andc. We reached the pilote ground at daylight and raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appeared and came along side and sent a pilot on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not yet arived and she left New York 5 days before we did. and that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool and she left New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner communicated before the steam ship Liverpool here in sight behind us and was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale and we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight and an English steam Boat soon came and took us in tow and soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed and fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. and Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, and Independance should all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days and the other 10 before the Oxford but so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health and spirits and for the first time I began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. and visited some of the  most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, andc. all of which were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, and vegitables that I ever saw The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson’s Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high and 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day. Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns FIGURES in his hand, and death stands by his side partly covered with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, and garnishing the out side of the buil- -ldings in the cities and towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, and gases, that rise from the dens population and burning of coal andc., the air is vary heavy and bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it vary singular to hear the Rector's, and Curit’s preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof and professing religion without having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite cozy and simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were ENDENTRY quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing has attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich and poor male and female, their cloth may be equally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear as tasty and flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit their dead in vaults in the church yard and them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in and out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be taken from the ship and go to the custom House and by examined by the Officer. and after much jaming, crouding and  rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks and baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books and papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at preston. and for the first mile the cars   run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings and inhabitants were over our heads. The cars run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand and it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once more behold this Brother face to face and all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to and from the the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in Preston on Jan 17th and the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool and Elders Manchester and Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston and its neighbourhood and Willford Woodruff and Potteries and warn the People in that place and then inquire the mind of the Lord and if it is his will go to Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons and Birmingham 300,000 and the place is larger than New york and is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston and in company with Elders Turley and Clark took the rail car and rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton and many Saints. Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls and is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members and the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother to visit a sister possessed with the devil and a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage and required 3 or 4 men to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her and commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and also rebuked the fever and after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, and the fever left her, and she was come calm and composed. The devel entered into her child next morning and made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child and rebuked the devil in the name of Jesus Christ and he instantly came out and the child fell asleep, and the woman attended meeting during the day I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester and in company with Elder Turley took coach and road (on the outside as the custom is) through Alfred Corden This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most of the English china, crockery and stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon he went 40 miles to recieve the work and be baptzed and was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a week for his daily bread and preaches evry evening in a week and 3 times on Sunday and he has alredy a little flock of Saints of 66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order and dissipline; the Saints have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, and my prayer to God is that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon and labour while the day last for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Scotland have began to preach and to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, and the doctors told him to take medicine and keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick and soon got well. persecution does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks and candles flung at their heads while preaching and occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followed me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem and Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded and attentive congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns and vary populous and whare they have not as yet herd the word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England and contains a large number of inha bitants and will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries and Birmingham. and we have already given out appointments part of the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey and of the country andc. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times and the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern country. Signs, wonders, and fearful sights are appearing, and the words of the Ancient and modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London  so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford’s bog land rose up from its mighty bed and travled with the rapidity  of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in  angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over  and in addition to these and many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen and parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to to protect them, and they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel  war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going through the streets begging Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories and out of  Employ and bread in one day, and I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting  what to do, and in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity and sin as well as trouble and distress and it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question andc. for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort the Saints to be as quiet as possible and be subject to the Laws of the Land and the powers that be. but it  requires the greatest of prudence and wisdom to hold public meetings and do the work of God in this country at the present time and under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe and must spedily be   ENDENTRY be reapted if the wheat is sowed. and God is assisting his servents in this country, and the work is begining to roll forth  more and more whare it is faithfully proclaimed and signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I  believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in Birmingham and that all of the capitol  places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth  to come forth from some quarter and they appear willing to hear, receive and imbrace it when it comes unto  them and while we are preaching and baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to  preach and baptize in Scotland and thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week and several times on the  Sabbath and baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation and a man  came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon- ism unveiled John F Boyanton Boynton. andc andc I was informed  the man was a Methodist preacher and brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him  to read it what we could by giving him lights, and water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury I answered him when he got through, and the people herd my answer with attention. All stories and reports that were  afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come  out and hear andc. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but  you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country and the vine yard of the Lord andc in this land. But I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you  by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved  but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or  8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary  anxious to hear from you and Sarah Emma and also about the Church around you, perhaps you may have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want  you to write as soon as you get this, wont you and give me an account of all matters and things  with you and Sarah, how your health is, and how you get along for help; food and rament, is their war between  New Orleans was destroyed by  the Commerce  tell me all about it. are they publishing the times and Seasons. give my respects to all the friends in Lovely Street, Montrose, and Commerce as far as you have an opportunity.

I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y.  also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois and diret the post Master to inform you of it  I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. and I do pray my heavenly Father that you may obtain this letter. and that it may not page torn be written in vain.

Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle and preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited  the large silk factory in New Castle and seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom whare ribbons, sattins, and silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, and while the sun  shines beatiful and pleasant, the parks, walks, and fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit  down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke  of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. and now Phebe wont you sit down and do so by me give  me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you and Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git a large sheet and fill it full. I want to know about the sickness and who is dead. and what Washington and what the prospect is concerning the Church and its progress in America. What news have you from our friends in Carters family when you write. I do not know that you will be able to read all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter and not lose it as I shall wish to see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through and again meet with my family But my Dear Friend and Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and warn the people of this generation, and prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-   page torn -paired for the coming of the Son of Man. and if we are faithful in this great work, and do the will of Jesus Christ and are  wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended and the victory won, then how sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward and how Eternal our happiness. and May the Lord  Jesus Christ intercede for us, and all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he  comes we may be like him and reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen  I remain forever your Companion and Friend  Willford Woodruff  Phebe W.

You (probably with  many others woho have called to see me) would say be careful and not take cold or sit up to long at first, I have tried to do so. Our little Will ford is a verry bright looking child with dark eyes his hair almost exactly the colour of yours. Sarah E. is as bright as ever and highly delighted with the babe. I often think how pleased you would be to see him and how happy we might be with our little family if you could be at home with us–may the Lord grant that it may soon be the case. Was I surroun ded by thousands I should in one sense be like the lonely dove that mourns her absent mate, who from hill, to hill, from vale, to vale, her sorrows doth relate. As my babe lay seeping sweetly on my arm thes^e^ words came to my mind I write them just as they come to my mind.  Sleep sweet babe and take thy rest, For God looks down and will thee bless, With all that's good, in earth, or heaven,              If thou wilt keep the commandments eleven.  Sister Smoot desires the addition of Owen  to our babe's name. I think that I shall have quite a present for you when you return if we are spared all of us to see each other. I have lately received a letter from Father Foss wrote in it, they they much desire a visit from you when you return, could you not take a ship bound for N.Y.  and pass two or three days there, they all much regretted my not comeing home and passing the time of your absence with them. Father tells me if I  am ever in want to come to his house where I shall find an asylum – sister  Foss wants you to take Ichabod if you come that way – Mother says that she expects to loose Mary failes more and more. I have not heard from father Woodruff's family since you left. I heard that Sarah Milliken was expecting to be married to a man out of the  church and likewise intemperate the sisters about here, wished me to write to her on the subject I did, mentioning sister Eliza Grants case to her but have received no  I forgot that I told you about Shuah and Ilus in the forepart of my letter as I have been sometime writing it. Will. is laying looking at me as I write in my lap ENDENTRY answer – dont know but that me for my plainness, but could not well help it, for I felt interested in her wellfare as we have been so intimately acquainted. I told you in my other letter that I had been liveing by the wayside as it were since you left me, I have moved 4 times since you, left home; that is  something for one whose health was as feeble as mine. I moved from Montrose to brother Clarke's then into a small house of his in the same door yard, just before I was confined–I chose to  go there that I might be more retired. I had every thing at that time that was necessary to make me comfortable and have been much blest of the Lord. I missed you much more at that time than before Oh! thought I if I could but have my Willford to call on instead of strangers what a comfort it would be to me but that time is past and over now, thank the Lord for it. Your prayer was answered in my haveing friends to stand by me when I needed them – the brethren are verry kind about here likewise the family where I now live. I shall probably stay where I am untill you return – father Clark says that you need not be concerned about ^me^ untill you get back only pray for me, he is verry kind.  Have you forgotten our hour for prayer, we have the third one to join us – sister Maine – she tries to observe the time and although far distant from each other we have the same God to call on, woh who hears the prayer of his children. We know not how to appreciate blessings untill we are deprived of them. We often see people who are permitted to live togather men to stay at home with their families but me thinks they do not realize their privileges. I often look on such families around me and think how happy they must be but I suppose they do not realize it, I even look on black Jack and  think if I could have my Willford live at home ^with^ me even if we had to work verry hard I should not mind or value that for then we might enjoy our humble pittance ^in^ each other's society which gives a relish to every blessing. You prob- ably remember our last ride togather out to brother Hawley's settlement to see our little Sarah, the prairies were most delightfuly clothed with flowers and  verdure and I thought it the most pleasent ride we ever had togather, the sabbath following I rode out to the same place in company with a number of others to a meeting and to see Sarah the flowers were there but they with every thing else were dressed in gloom and looked lonely as I felt, nothing looked cheerful but my little Sarah, I found her health much improved which was  much satisfaction to me – these with many other reflections pass and repass through my mind – but in the midst of them something whispers Phebe do you want your companion to come home to you before he has filled his pres- ent mission my heart answers no but Lord give me patience and a willingness to  wait his return and hasten the time that he shall be returned to the bosom of his ENDENTRY family after haveing filled hit misn thy love and fear which may God grant for Christs sake.  It seames to be my turn now to write to you mostly now as this is  the third letter I have written you since I received any from you.

The pre sent present prospect is  that Congress will do nothing for our Church now as a letter from Washington has lately been received bearing that I inteligence–brother H. will probably give you the particulars concerning it and all other church affairs I suppose.

It afforded me much satisfaction as I had  long and anxiously been looking to hear from you—did not get your  letter written Nov. 22th. The last communication but one I received from you was dated Oct. 31th. The last time before this I wrote you was in  Dec. after I arrived in Scarborough. I should have immediately  complyed with your request in answering your letter but it was so late in the month when it arrived, as you thought of starting the first of April I thought you would not be likely to get it. I thought I would send you a few lines to N.Y. hopeing you will get them.  I said I sit down with peculiar feelings because I hope to be permitted to once more behold your face not many days after you receive this. I think you will not tarry long in N.Y. (hope so at least). When I came home we left  N.Y. one night and arrived at Boston in the cars and  stage as the steam-boat did not run then—it was more expensive. The Portland  boat commences running tomorrow fare to Boston $2 if there is an opposition boat it will be less. Our fare from Iowa here was some o over 40 dolls. You spoke of your baggage box, do as you please about it. I should like to see the  things you spoke of, if it would be expensive do not bring it but if you have  any articles of clothing for me or Willy you may take them—of course you will take  what things you want yourself. i My health is not verry good this spring Willy is well and smart.

Mr. Wilford Woodruff, Pres. Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S. Salt Lake City. Utah.  Dear Sir:  Recognizing that the Gos- pel was restored to the Earth through Joseph Smith, and that through him also Christ's Church was organized, does that exclude every person, not be- longing to that Church, from the ben- efits, blessings, and direct influence of God, and the h^H^oly Spirit? And prior to the time of establishing that church, could any one have communion with God or the Holy Spirit? Can people who pray to God and sincerely believe that their prayers will be answered. – can such people, not Latter Day Saints, expect a blessing, or any answer to their prayers? Can they ex- pect the manifestation of God's power in any miraculous way? Could they work miracles? Can the reach the throne of him who answers prayer, and be saved? Are their payers of  any avail? I have my opinions but they do not harmoize with those of my  neighbor. I may not understand the matter, but I want to and therefore I have taken this liberty. Will you please explain it to me.

When I was a stranger in a strange land Advocating principles of the fulness of the– everlasting Gospels of the Son of God Although as true as any principle that ever emenated from the tr^h^rone of Jehovah yet the most of all Doctrins unpopular with that class whose minds are limited to the sectarial notions and traditions of the present generation instead of expending to receive the revelations of Jesus Christ which doctrine freequetly subjected me with my friends to unfair opposstion persecution warrents andc It was in the midst of this order of things that I found Col Solomon Copeland among the first to step forth as a Gentleman, friend and Republican to assist us in maint- aning our rights and ^you^ not ownly treated me and my friends with common civility and sociability But all of our wants were bountifuly supplyed under your hospitable roof. This Sir was not all I discovered that whenever any principle was presented that was high, Noble, and glorious that when carried out would have a tendency to ennoble man and exhalt him to the highest grade ^degree^ of usefulness, ENDENTRY intelligence and glory that was ever designed for man by the God of heaven that it would strike a cord and vibrate your soul as with the rapidity of lightning yea the silent Language of which was, this is congenial with my spirit and the sentiments of my heart. And whenever in my perigrinations I have met with any master spirits of this kind I have marked it in my mind and laid it up in my memory for a future day, permit me Sir to say that inasmuch as you are one of the most prominant ones with which I have met in my travels I feel disposed to express my mind freely to you upon the subject which I have in view. Sir Those primary principle appertaining to the Kingdom of God and the salvation of man which we taught in our spiritual Infancy and in which you seemed to take a deep interest are of no less consequence now than there in fine evry day that rolls over our heads adds to its mag- nitude and importance for whenever any great and Noble purpose work or plan is put into operation its light and influence is seen and felt more and more by the Nations of the Earth Much Sir has been said concerning us as a people, our motives and principles have all the day long been misrepresented by wicked and designing men. We as a people are not known in our true light I would to God we were I would to God that president Joseph Smith was known in his true light to all the wise, the good, the virtuous, the meek and the honest  in heart and they would be lauded by a portion of the same spirit that is like fire shut up in his bones He ownly kneed to be known by men to be haled as one born out of due time to frown upon oppession, plead the cause of the oppressed, as the universal ENDENTRY friend of man, to introduce Intelligence and wisdom into the world, To raise a standard of light and truth as a Banner to the Nations of the Earth that time nor man canot extinguish or destroy. He has thus far by the Help of God out- rode the storm of persecution heaped upon him by his enemies who have saught to take away from ^him^ evry right that the Laws and Constitution garantee unto him as well as evry American citizen, his course has been onward in the midst of evry difficulty untill he has erected one of the largest cities of the west ^containing a population of some 15 or 20,000 souls^ and is surrouded not ownly with the ^best^ intelligence and wisdom of the Earth as his council but with thousands of friends who would in a moment ^if necssary^ lay down their li^v^ves in his defence against oppression and mobs, and as the time has arived when we deem it no longer necessary to put men in office to use our influence in promoting men to the highest offices of this government who will not act for the good of the people but for their own aggrandizement and  party purposes. And we as a people have come to the ^conclusion^ conclusion to run a candidate for president of the United States at the next election And that candidate is General Joseph Smith. And sirs the request I wish to make of you is to know  if you are willing to permit us to use your name as a candidate for vice president at the next elec^t^ion and also to invite you to p^f^avor us with a visit at Nauvoo I make this request of your honor according to the council of the Authorities of the City of Nauvoo, and we should be Happy to see you and you will meet with a welcome reception in our midst and I think Sir you would Be amply ENDENTRY ^repaid^ in your feelings for taking a journey of this kind; I trust Sir you will favor me with an answer to  this the earliest opportunity.

Prest Woodruff and members of the Twelve Apostles:  Dear Brethren:–  On Saturday last the 12th inst, I received a copy of a con: joint report made by two committees, one appointed by yourselves and one by the Board of Directors of Z.C.M.I., whose duty it was to investigate the merits of propositions to be made by me looking to the inauguration of a company for the production and manufacture of Sugar in this Territory.  If the Brethren had seen fit, before they made their report, to have accorded to me even one opportunity of laying before them in Board assembled the information correspondence and corrob- orative evidence at my command, I would have esteemed it as a courteous kindness to me, and a respectful apprecia- tion of the Powers at whose instance and in whose behalf they acted, and of the importance of the business to be discussed, and I feel assured that the recommendation contained in the latter part of their report would not have been made.  I thank you respectfully for having appointed said committee ENDENTRY and express my regret that the circumstances in which  you are placed render it impossible for you to extend financial aid (which however my understanding of the position forbade me to expect at present), nevertheless I hope that the portion of said committee's report indicating the advisability of a postponement to another year will not prevent your giving moral support to myself and other friends of the Industry who are entering upon the inauguration of the enter- prise the present season, and if it be not asking too much I respectfully solicit that in acting upon the report of the committee you specify that your sympathy for and moral support of this movement shall be accorded.  Permit me to say for myself and the brethren who are associa- ting for the inauguration of the Industry referred to, that we see in it (and of its success we are substantially convinced) and the saving of the immense amount of money now expended and the large profits that will certainly result, the gratifying possibility of strengthening and establishing other industries which shall be made to afford or furnish appropriate labour to large numbers of workmen of various trades and manufactures, many of whom are now but partially employed and that in labour to which they have not been accustomed.  We see that there must be an advanced state of prosperity ENDENTRY for the people at large before they can avail themselves of the superior advantages for Education which it is in your minds to introduce, for to many thousands of our brethren in their present condition and circumstances the proffer of these oppor- tunities for proper and advanced Education would be as the tempting viands placed before, but just beyond the reach of, the mythological Tantalus. Surely to retain symmetry in the growth of the Tree of God's planting the temporal, as well as the spiritual, should partake of the elements of suitable and consistent nourishment.  For the sake of the principles involved, and that the nation may not have to answer for the gross and unwarrant- able robbery and persecution, vastly more than for the property in question. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will render judgment in favor of the Church in the suits now pending in Washington  Respectfully submitted Your Brother in the Gospel  Arthur  Stayner ENDENTRY The 6th of January 1889  President W. Woodruff!  Dear Brother!  Your letter, as a call for me to go on a Mission to Switzerland and Germaney, has come to hand severall weeks ago, and I beg your pardon for wayting so long before I have answered.  My feelings, my wish and desire is, to respond to the call, and I hope that no evil Power can hinder me. I hope to be ready and prepared to start at the apointed date and from the apointed place. I do not know what may happen untill that time, it seems my Enemies has not forgotten me; I have been absent from  home since the 8th of March 1887, and now I have received word that my Family has to go to Ogden to appear before the Grand Jury as Wittnesses againts me. I do hope, that I will not be ENDENTRY betrayed, that they can not find me, but that I will be able to go on my Mission, for I think I can do more good there. If you have aney further council, or advice to give me or aneything to writte to me, please adress the letter to C. F. Bessler Logan City, but leave my name out on the Envelope alltogether, for the one in the Post Office seeks to find out all he can, he is non to good to oppen letters, for he has done it. I hope and wish that this new Year will be a happy one for you, that the Blessings of the Lord will be with you continuelly and no ^evil^ Power will be able to injure you in aney way.

Willford Woodruff  Dear Brother  I notice that there are some Seventys that are beeing seclected for missions, that are not very well prepared to go, Both in  ability to teach and financley.  And there are a number of young men some High Priests and some Elders, that would make good missionaries in the world, That I could recomend if they are wanted. We would like to keep a few out all the time, as the influance of a young man returning from a mission is felt for good in the ward where he is from.  There is a young man in the Cannonville ward, John H Davis, that would make a good missionary, he has broken the Edmons Law within two years, and he is on hand if wanted in the missionary field. Bishop William J. Henderson ENDENTRY of Cannonville Ward is in the same boat he is a man about 50 years of age, he  is not in very good circumstances financly what would be advisable in his ^or such^ case.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:–  Bro. Fredrick Jensen Holt, of Ephraim  desires to go back to Denmark as a miss- ionary, both to preach and also to obtain his geneology, as far as he can.  His age is sixty-four past, not much calculated to preach. He is a widower, two daughters, but both are married, means very limited. He is an inoffensive good Later-day Saint. His most ardent desire to go back is to obtain his genology as he is the only one of the family. I have rather discouraged him little and advised him to obtain ^it^ through brethren who are already there in the  field, and that he might defray the expenses for the same. He feels  (over) ENDENTRY that a word from you, either in  favor or against his going, would satisfy him.  In our last talk, I promised I  would write to you on the subject. He desires to go with the brethren that leave after April Conference, if you consider it allright.  Please excuse me for troubling you with this matter.

Woodruff  Dear Brother,  I received your letter of 29 Dec. 1888 the day after, calling me on a mission to Salt Lake 9th April 1889 andc also your favor of 20th inst. to day, which I will try to answer, the reason I have not done it before is that I waited for our Bishop to come home from the pen. My feelings with regard to this call are as I stated in  my former letter, good, and I am willing to go on the day appointed, but I can  not see how I can get the means. I stated in my ENDENTRY letter before, that I did not have any money to start the journey with, nothing to make these winter months and a large family. I stated in my last that I have 2 sons that would be a great help to the family in my absense, if the Lord would bless them with health and profitable employ- ment, but it would ^be^ unnat- ural to expect that they could take the whole burden and go right along with it, and provide for the family without mater- ial assistance. I therefore ask if the time could be ex- tended a few months, which would give me a chance to straighten up some finan- cially, and be better prepared to help myself, but in case  that something should turn up in my favor between now and April 9th that would enable me to go, then I will try and report myself in time. I hate to have to be so humble, but it seems to be my lot.  Will you please answer this as soon as you can and oblige your brother in the Gospel  O. H.

If it is your wish that I should go will you please notify me now as I have to sell my team and would like to make my arrangements accordingly hoping this will meet with your approval  I remain Yours andc  Wm H Evans ENDENTRY Provo City, Utah, April 27th 1889  Pres.

Utah Co U.T.  Wilford Woodruff Esq.  Dear Sir!  The situation your Church is in, and as you are the head of that Church; your  situation is at present extremly precarious, I have a scheme to offer you, that would make you and your Church triumph and gain a complete Victory, and I garrantee that Utah would be- come a state within five years if you manipu- late this scheme as I will tell you. I am surpris- ed you have not hit upon it long before now, it is not against the principles of your faith; and and is nothing worse than what your people voted for in the late Constitution, yet the scheme is such that the Gentiles can not possibly discover the trick at all, if you but have from 25 to 50 thousand of  your people you can depend upon; that would do as you tell them, when you first get to hear it you will be extremely glad as it will save you from de- struction and disgrace, and would cause all of your ENDENTRY people have unbounded confidence in yourself, and it would bring tens of thousands of people into your Church, because they would think you in- spired indeed, and it would be worth untold milli- ons of dollars into the Church treasury.  This is not overdrawn as you yourself knows that if Utah became a State, that such would be the prestige you would have, that the above would result; and if you but will carry out my scheme, Utah is bound to be a state in a few years at most. I have no possible interest in your Church, as I look upon it as a fraud "from the  word go." but if you will pay me handsomely, say: $200,000 00/100 I will tell you said scheme, if you do not act upon this you have better  make up your mind to: that your Church will go to destruction because of the failures of Smiths Prophesies, but if Utah becomes a state those failures will be forgotten.  But if you conclude to undertake this scheme it must be kept absolutely secret, exept to those initiated, if it becomes public it will fail. If you a accept my offier I am willing ENDENTRY for you to bind me as tight in writing as you like, but one fifth must be paid down before  I tell it. There will be no more expences to pay for Lawyers, ect. to go to Washington to fight for your cause, as it will be smooth sailing into the Union. I am willing to give you a bond to the effect, that if you do as I tell you, and Utah do not become a state within five years, that I will refund you the money paid me.  Please write and tell me if you will un- dertake this matter, will you come to see me? That would be best. Please remember that often it is the obscure in this world that is the best inventors.  My ideas are too valueable to give them away. I live at mouth of Maple Canyon, Springville Utah Co  Yours Respectfully  Ch. E. Malmström. ENDENTRY Gunnison Aug 20th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff S. L. City  Dear Brother–. Your favor of Aug. 15th received.

My wife died in February; my only son is in Canada; my things are in such a scatter- ed condition, that if I were to  leave now, I should have to lock up the house and leave it  to itself.

For me to ask for a good partner is becaus I am very poor in the language. I came to this country when I was only 6 year old, have not studied the language as I should have done. I can speck partly but can not read or write the same. I realise that it will be hart for me to ^go^ into a strange country with out an exsperenced missionary. I hope that you will not exspect me to. I would like to get a man that is pretty well posted in the Iceland language and one that knew the country a little. If thair was a missionary thair now. which I could go to work  with as it is in other places I would not ask what I do. My curcumstances is not as good as I would like them to be I have a Father and Mother about 70 years of age to take care of, and a mother died 5 months ago. I will need some help in from the ward in a financial way. but will help my self all ENDENTRY I can. I am very thankful to you for the length of time you have given me to prepare in. I am sure that the Lord will turn thing in my favor, with his help I will be at the Historians Office at the apointed time ul^n^less sickness or death hinders me. these few words was on my mind so I thought I would write them.

Woodruff. Beloved and Affectionate Brother  It is under peculiar circumstances and amid peculiar feelings that I take up my pen to once more address you and perhaps trouble you because of the length of it. But Brother Asahel bear with me this once come now lay aside your Books and convers awhile with Willford I have much I wish to say to you perhaps you may be interested in some of it. I have thought that I have been burthen some to you in some of my letters since we saw each other as I have not receieved much of any answer from you perhaps they have contained to much what the world calls mormonism to have been of any interest to you. But as I have been visiting our friends I thought it might be interesting to you in some degree to know sumthing about it whare I have been the whys and the wharefores andc. and I wish to write to you jut as I would talk as easy and simple as truth itself whether it is grammatical or not in or out of measure. I am not polished in what the world calls learning (anyhow) But I desire to convers considerable with you now and if I am troublesome tell me of it and I will do better for the future I have had a happy visit with my friends Ill now tell you about it  I left fairport and arived at Azmons in Richland. I had not time to tarry but a short time with them. I was truly glad to see them once more they were generally enjoying good ^health^ I think excepting Elizabeth which was not vary good I ownly spent one night among them Thompson looked natural as ever he works hard they looked slick around the farm. Cousin Con- necticut the morning I left for Sackets Harbor from thence to Joneses falls we past though four locks that cost $100,000 each said to be the most splendid works in America. After attending a conference in Canida I returned to Colebrook father had mooved his family the day before I arived I called at the rock school house three or four times to visit Sister Eunice I do not know that I can give you a description of my visit with her any better than to copy a page from my journal which I wrote upon the subject which is as follows  FIGURES  June 21st 1837. In Colebrook I wrap'd at a school house door it opened by a female hand, and lo it was a sister, yes sister Eunice indeed. We saluted each other with a harty shake of the hand shorthand I conversed with her a few moments with joy, and retired. June 28 th at 11 oclock AM I entered the school tought by sister Eunice, five hours I spent within its walls amid as great variety of sensations as ever vibrated my bosom. I beheld my sister my ownly sister, seventeen years of age adorned with youth, modesty, and lovliness with her face veiled with the true picture of PHILO. with a degree of admiration I gazed upon the change five years had brought upon HER. HER sprightly step with energy was marked while teaching the youth. To more perfectly call to mind the rec ollection of youth and past scenes and to entertain my mind amid the passing hours, this sister presented me (with a cheerful grace) a bundle of Letters from an absent brothers I looked them through and through they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters I read fifteen in number to Eunice directed. They brought to my soul as great a variety of feeling as matter they contained. They presented to my view, the display of a cultivated mind and the refined talents of a brother presented to a sister with the most untarnished friendship and deepest feeling for her wel- lfare that can grace the human soul. Such teachings as these to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would deliver them from a thousand snares. The name of Willford was mentioned oft Asahel had not forgotten him. (O heaven pro tect my Parents my Brethren and my sister) While at once I viewed this three years convers of Asahel, I smiled, I wept.  Eunice preserve those in memory of a brothers love, regard these teachings they will lead thee in the paths of safty. I left the house and by my sisters side I viewed the Colebook land- scapes as we walked. my soul was pressed. O I spake of Asahel, I thought of him, I asked what he would say if he knew whare we were. ah says Eunice he would wish to be here. We visited our parents dwelling at sages mill, but they had gone to Farmington we entered the, house and found all as emty, vacant, silent and still as death. Not a parent or brother to salu te, we entered the chamber and saw the work of Asahels hands but nothing left but a stick balanced by a string in the closet to hold his coat. it was to gloomy to tarry long I droped a tear and retired believing it more pleasent on the banks of the Missouri I took a drink from the well while depart- ing Eunice plucked each of us a, rose as we left we walked up the hill while the stones, stumps, hills and dales, looked natural. We was soon kindly received by Mr. Jonathan Stillmans hous hold took a seat at his board and sup'd together which closed the scene. HOW pleasing and how painful are the scenes of LIFE July 4th INDEPENDANCE how can I enjoy the better than to visit a lonely sister thought I, so a steed I mounted at Canaan to visit Eunice but when I arived she was ^x^ gone to a saleing ^x^ sailing party on a pond I rode near to it as I approached they crossed from me I hoisted a flag in token of friendship they discovered it and bow'd to my notice but knew not that it was Willford as the watery element wafted them from my sight behind a grove I bowed saying GOD save my sister shorthand ENDENTRY I took the stage in Avon July 5th I made a short stop in Richard B Cowles and past on I arived at Woodford tavern and once more trod the soil of Avon. I spent the night at aunt Luther, I went over to Nod to see the friends there Daniel Wheeler has had a hard time of it in the whaleing line, he was broot ^brought^ to America in irons and is now willing to stay in Avon friends in Avon enquire much about Asahel they have receieved papers from the west I told them they were from you I took some papers from Sages store Directed to father. Sister Eunice is a fine girl she gets along well in school. Apr July 6thI left aunt Wheelers and set out to visit the friends in our old neighbourhood andc. I went first to Uncle Adney's he has been quite sick uncle Adney looks very old aunt Ezra has his poor times yet I have not seen him from Adnyes I went to the mill Henry Woodfrord now owns it it looked natural I went up to the house and all over it and saw bogue hill and looked all around the farm and it all gave me curious feelings Henry Woodford not at home I saw his Obed Harts (I was accompanied all the while by Elder Jonathan Hale a Brother that came with me from Roger Woodford then I found Day I took dinner with them, I then went up to Uncle Titus Woodruff he was not at home I saw his family Claltha Herd was there I saw nothing uncommon here excepting a pen of black and white rabits I called upon Capt Francis Woodruff Capt Adna andc they were all glad to see me I next went to Uncle ^{shorthand}^ Han nah was at home and glad to see me after spending an hour here I called to see Almirah Fuller from there I went to Canal bank down to the house and I cry to my soul I once more saluted my Mother by the shake of the hand {shorthand} she made me hartily welcome very soon our Father came into the house we took each other by the hand and both rejoiced I once more set down to the table with my Parent's father looks old he fails I wish he might spend his last days with his sons. Mr Herd has just come into the house he says he is well. They have had bad millers since father left, things were much out of repair. things look natural all about the river. I have not yet been into the street I do not know how they look there I expect to return to Avon on the morrow and preach in Lovely street. I preached evry day for a week on Beach hill I expect Sister Eunice will come home soon to visit with me. I expect to spend about three weeks in wife did not accom- pany me from Kirtland for I had business in UP Canida I expectshe she will come to Albany with some friends then take the Stage and come to Avon. Eunice is expecting to come home (when my wife comes) to visit Father and Mother once more I should essteem it a great privilege to see you with us I am expecting to go infrom this to the State of Mane to visit my wifes relatives before I leave that country I expect to visit Fox islands about 200 miles east of Mane to introduce the gospel we think it is time to begin to visit the islands of the sea five of the brethren have gone to England the work  ENDENTRY blank ENDENTRY is progressing rapidly in the earth. I want to say a few words to you about the cause I am engaged in and the course I am persuing. I am sensible we ought to be care- ful what we put on paper and send abroad and I have at times thought I was not sufficiently careful upon this subject, lest even friends draw wrong views and conceptions from my writings and to save any thing of this nature even from your mind and wish here to make a remark. ie. since my first conncetion with the Latter Day Saints I have been happy, contented, and satisfied. I know and bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ that the Book of mormon is the revealed will of God, and also that Joseph Smith jr is a prophet of God, and that the Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts and graces. I know the same signs now follow the believers that did anciently and as I have prooven this work and know it to be true for myself, I am entirely unshaken in its work and in consquence of this, my soul being wrap'd in the work, when I have written to any of my friends (yourself not excepted) I have principly written upon the subject and this is why I say, perhaps I have been to tegious tedious in my letters to you. But I do not wish to burthen any, of my friends in this or any other way. my ownly motive for not writing to Azmon more than I have since I have been travling, was because I thought they might not be entertaining to him at this time. I have written vary plain to Azmon in one Letter it is true, But I have nothing in my breast against him or any relatives I have in the world. Again I receieved a letter from you last winter wishing to correspond with me and you wished to know all about my temporal matters I set down and write you one or two vary full letters, I told you, about my entering some land in Missouri this land I entered at congress prise pi pir acre I ownly entered 40 acres for an inheritance or home, this money was a present from some friends in N. Y. the Land now I suppose is worth $10 or $15 dollars per acre as it is near the county seat. I also speak of our safety fund that I took some shares in that, now why I speak of this is, I did not know but you might draw the idea that I had left the gospel and gone to speculating but this is not the case. I feel that the spirit that rolls in my veins is steadfast upon the subject, and I shall go tho to the gulentine, faggot, or death before I shall renounce it the reason of this remark is because I know it to be true. But enough upon this subject at this time. Now Brother Asahel for heavens sake do not think that I have drop'd a remark in this letter to cast any reflections upon you or any body els I have none to cast. Shall it be said that we must be seperated in feelings and other ties of consanguinity severed because we may not think alike upon religious subjects let God forbid, I love you. I respect you, I have never had cause to do otherwise and I trust I never shall. I thank kind heaven that I have a Brother whose interest is manifest for the welfare of Eunice and our Parents. Brother Asahel throw a cloak of charity over my imperfections Letters from you will ever meet a well come recep- tion from my hand. If I live I some expect to leave this Continent for Europe another season should it or should it not be the case it will be a great pleasure to me to receieve letters from you from time to time I feel interested in your wellfare both temporal and spiritual watch the signs of the times remember you have such a brother as Willford in the world if we do not see each other before we will soon stand in the presence of God. your parents send their respects to you, mother says she will write to you again soon.

Dear brother  I received your truly interesting letter of 5th January two days since and I am happy in improving an early opportunity to reply. I perused your letter of Nov 20th to Elders Journal" with much satisfaction. The account you gave of your ministry upon the "Island of the Sea" in that communication together with other particulars in your last letter to me enables me to form a pretty just estimate of the result of your labors. I am happy my beloved brother to assure you that I rejoice in the success of those ministers of the gospel of the Son of God who are not ashamed to declare the truth in opposition to popular error. And although I confess myself an incompetent judge of the merits of the "faith" of the "Latter Day Saints" as a system of religion yet, I entertain an erroneous impression if the struggle between popular secta- -rianism ^(2)^ and "Mormonism" ^(1)^  is not a strife between liberty of speech and toleration in religious opinion and their antipodes – dumb sevility servility to the prejudices of education and the trammels of an illiberal bigotry.  You make some allusion to the "reserve" and "distain" of some of your friends on account (as you suppose) of your odd religious profession. That the deportment of some of them should be affected in some degree by this circumstance seems to me very natural and indeed when we consider how very inconvenient it is for most persons under the circumstances to appreciate properly the character and motives of the "Saints" it is reasonable to expect themat many will turn up their noses and make wry faces. I do not however suppose that in the care of your early acquaintances you have just grounds for doubting their respect and confidence for as far as I am acquainted with their views they give you much credit for your devotion to such a cause. There is perhaps nothing cause from ^by^ which we are so much anoyed in the world as the misconstructions that are put upon ENDENTRY our actions thus we are continually misunderstood and consequently our motives are misappreciated (if I may manufacture a term). I am apt to imagain that the world is not half so bad as it appears to be though I must confess my conviction that many persons are far worse than they seem. We do not know the motives by which men are governed in their intercouse with us and hence when their conduct is opposed to our wishes and interest we set them down as bad men, while perhaps at the same time they are only opposing to our selfish views the purest principles of their integrity In refference to your leaving Richland and joining the "Mormons" I received my first impression either directly or indirectly from brother Azmon than whom not even yourself could have felt a deeper interest in a pernniary point of view He was grieved and his friends sympathised with his sorrow and I in the tenderness of my heart conoled with him. I reflected upon your conduct – and passed sentence of unqualified condemnation uupon it. In letters both to Azmon and to friends at home I took occasion to allude to the matters and I spoke of you leaving in terms of reproach! I would not conceal from you that I thought you had done foolishly or even wickedly. I would not recall those thoughts. I do not even wish they had not occurred for they stand an evidence of my honesty and sincerity. And what is my apology? You will find it in the imperfection of human nature. And in appealing to you for your charity – to your brother for his confidence. I have no doubt I shall meet a ready response. And formy folly I hesitate not to believe you will both find an excuse in my apology. It was silly in me to make the remarks I did about the Letter from England for really I had no ENDENTRY serious fault to find with even the objectionable passage it was only an affair of bad taste and worse judgment. which ought to have been more than ballanced by the very good intention which manifestly dictated the sentence. I am ashamed to be caught in such folly but brother I am prone to it. I do and say a thousand foolish things which I regret a moment after and if you could only witness my intercourse with the world for one day only you would be surprised to find half as much sense in my letters as this contains!!  I do not pretend to note half the contents of your letter. I cannot even reply to that part which relates to "Sister" except to tell you that I have had sweet dreams both waking and sleeping about her since your items.  How much I should delight in visiting you and your interesting Lady I cannot well express I have even thot of going to Fox Island for the purpose yet I fear I shall not - at all events I shall calculate much on thepleasure of seeing you here as you intimate next fall I heard Joseph Smith Jr preach when he was here last fall.

Woodruff Feb 8th 1838 ENDENTRY Scarborough Maine May 2nd 1838  Dear Brother  While the Sun is shedding its beams to gladden earth I sit down beneath a fathers roof in company with my companion to address a few lines to you. My last was dated March Vinalhaven Maine that sheet was principally occupied with the feelings of my mind upon things future. I would here remark that a person situated as I am in life and calling knows not whare the morrow will find him at all times. I have of late held two conferences in Vinalhaven one upon each Island and organized a Church in each place both containing about fifty members and so they are now in a situation to attend to their meetings without me I have concluded to leave them for a season and in consequence of recieving some intelligence of interest from the City of P. P. Pratt and others I have concluded to take a mission that way for two or three months I shall probably visit Holliston, and N Y City as we have Members in these places. The work of the Lord is progressing with great rapidity and power  in the City of N Y. under the preaching of Elder Pratt he is now Baptizing in the city by day and night he has the use of two meeting houses and also Tammany's Hall the most noted Hall in the City which is freely furnished and advertized at the expens of the Infidels as the Priests are disposed to call them the work is spreading in the county as well as City some come 20 or 30 miles to hear and obey the gospel and the calls are more numerous than they can possibly attend to. As to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts, the Priests many of them rage and foam and go to such lengths that every honest man is under the necessity of coming out from them. The Saints are firm in the City and are ready to suffer death for Christs sake and the truths. I do not know the number Baptized in the City Elder Pratt writes in his last that 75 have been added and that the work has but just begun and sayes we are crouded beyond conception - two pamphlets and many papers are filled against us but all tends to give us the attention of the people The Editor of the Zions Watchman is vary busy against  us and his paper is teeming with falshood and misrepresentation. I have answered him ENDENTRY in a pamphlet of 42 pages which I want circulated whareever the Pratt As our printing Office is burned I am well aware that those opposed to us in sentiment will make every exertion to prejudice the minds of community before we are in a cituation to answer them but I expect the Elders Journal will soon be issued from the press at the City far West Mo There is some individuals that have been cut off from the Church in Kirtland (by the voice of the Church) which are making as great an exertion against us as any of the world W Parrish is their leader; but the work of God still rolls on in spite of all their falshoods and misrepresentations.  I have just arived at Father Carter's from the N. Y. in company with Elder Milton Holmes a Brother that I highly essteem I have traveled with him thousands of miles we have passed through sufferings and trials together as well as enjoyed many happy seasons  I wish here to remark that  as I may not be stationary at present that I wish you to direct your communications to Scarborough Maine those that you send to me at present perhaps you may have sent one letter to Vinalhaven that I have not yet recieved if so I expect it will be remailed to me and forwarded to Scarborough Mrs Woodruff will remain here at her fathers house until we go west in the fall and she will attend to all letters sent me she is enjoying comfortable health and wishes to be remembered to you. I am still enjoying good health. I am expecting to be gone about two months on my journey to N Y. and it is my present intention to visit our friends in Connecticut before I return. I have not herd from any of them for a length of time. I have not much temporal news to communicate to you at this time business is exceding dull in this county some of the Banks are resuming specie payment most of them I think will soon except the rotten ones which are numerous. This state are waking up as to their political matters they are determined to redeem themselves from their last years negligence which I think they will do. Their is a company of Saints expect to accompany me from fox Islands to the far west in Sept next should you come east this spring I should be happy to meet you in Connecticut at our Fathers House ENDENTRY When you write to me give me the inteligence you have from any of our friends which would be greatfully recieved. I have recieved the papers from your City which you sent me from time to time I learned from your last that Terre Haute was an incorporated City and that you and Mr Smith had dissolved pardonship and that you was carrying on your business alone I wish you much success in all lawful and honorable undertakings and I have no reason to suppose that you will be FIGURE engaged in any other. I would suppose that your tinde of business would increase and hold as good as any trade in that country as the tide of emigration is constant and without doubt will continue to increase. I am pleased with the Idea of your locating yourself so far west and I wish more of our friends were in the western country for the west must increase while the east decreases in my view. I could not be contented to locate myself and till the earth in New England but should delight in it in the west I presume you are closely confined to your business as your are now alone and perhaps you do not think of visiting the east page torn at present. I should be happy to visit our Parents and Sister once. page torn I often feel sorry for our Father considering his age and how hard he has to  work in old connecticut alone without any of his Children to visit him or Mother I expect they have many gloomy hours thinking about it But so it is time makes a great seperation and changes with a gener- ation.

As I sat down to write in company with Cossett. by the N.W. window of our kitchen a little putty pretty bird came and lit on the window case by the side of my hand bearing a feather in his mouth and he tried to take hold of my pen with his bill, what this omen is I know not, whether the bird had a message to you or what his object could have been remains yet to be revealed I am not verry superstitious concerning such matters and I leave the subject and haste to my business. I have had an interesting journey through the eastern sea board towns since I last wrote you. after visiting a number of towns and churches I arived at the city of Boston it being the ^my^ first time visit to the city of cours I spent some time in visiting the different parts of it I went to the top of the splendid State House and paid some attention to most of the objects that would be of interest to common historians I walked about Bunker Hill monument and in fine I spent a busy day in visiting Boston, Cambridge, andc. with the exception of a few hours of the latter part of the day and part of the night following I was closly confined with locks, bolts, and bars, in Cambridge goal, not for crime but I went in voluntarily to comfort an Elder of Israel that was cast into prison ahwile for dept debt. I spent several days in Boston and preached several times among the Saints in the city and I found the church there firm in the faith after visiting Holliston I took steem Boat at N.Y. of cours I saw many things to interest me here The shipping, the city, the rich, the poor and the market made me think of Babylon ^x^ more then any thing els. I had a glorious ^time^ here with the Saints the work of God was progressing rapidly I spent several days in this great city and pre- ached several it times to the people. Our Elders had just returned to NY. from England they brought cheering intelligence they had Baptized about 2000 and ordained 100 Elders and the work was progressing rapidly when they left. After spending a few days in the city I took steam Boat for Newburg on North river from there I walked 40 miles west to Greenville the people here flung open their public houses, Academies,  S^c^hoolhouses, private houses, andc. and I preached about 10 days to the wondering multitude ENDENTRY and quite a number manifested their faith in the work and several offered themselves for Baptism but it was finally omitted for a season and 9 fondly left without Baptism any in the places but I sowed the seed some of which will bring forth fruit I next traveled by land to Farmington and was again joyfully receeved at a Fathers House I have often wished I could have had your company while on this visit. I never have enjoyed a visit of my fathers house more agreeable than this, every thing looks more natural at home at this time than it did last season. Father works hard. Uncle Ozem was sawing shingles for father last week. I have spent most of my time at Fathers since my return. I have preached several times since I returned to my fathers house. I have generally had full attendance, some are believing the fulness of the gospel. Last friday I went out to Uncle Adna's; I found a bea tree on the way, I showed Adna where it was. I had an interview with Aunt Hannah, she is better in health, but does not yet have her reason. I spent the night with Uncle grandmother Thompson and Michael Bouler,  cousins Adna and Mirah, after spending the day visiting such folks all looking natural  I spent the night with Uncle Alson Thompson. I preached twice Sunday in the Lovely Street Schoolhouse to an attentive congregation. Cousin Horace W was present, I had a talk with him, I dismissed the meeting and bid them farewell and perhaps for the last time, and walked down to Adna's with Ozem, and I preached there at 5 oclock to a congregation from Cider Brook Baldwin, Ebenezar and Harlow Miller, andc. I ret returned to fathers with Aunt Cossett. I have an appointment at Fathers next Sunday and some are going forward in Baptism Aunt Cossett for one. I shall leave on Monday for Mother there minds andc. and Father but you see I cannot now, I never saw Eunice in a better state of mind than now, I am troubled with weak eyes or I should have written more and oftener. what destruction there is among the steam Boats. and it appears some like war to. w^W^rite to me when you receeve this and direct to Scarborough Maine.

Brother Asahel,  I suppose you have given up the idea by this time of ever hearing directly from me again, but I can tell you brother, that nothing but a multiplicity of business, would have caused this long delay, and in fact I have for a few weeks past had no time comparatively speaking but what has been devoted to ^necessary^ household affairs, have not retired to rest much of the time before midnight, and arise at 4 or 5 in the morning, and you must be aware I think, that after laboring quite hard so many hours in the day. I must of course, become weary, and consequently not in much of a writing mood, but the above apologies, bungling as they are must for the present suffice.  I have, now, Asahel, a privilege which I have never before been favored with, and may never be again viz. that of addressing a few lines to you upon the same sheet with Brother Willford. you have learned of course by Willfords communication that he is now at his fathers house in Farmington, a few mornings ago, after breakfast, says I to mother, "I will get the front room in order, for Willford will be here to day I guess."  I accordingly did, and paraded the wax seal in the afterpart of the day, and about four oclock, I cast my eyes out of the wax seal window, and to my astonishment shall I say, when I was expecting it, saw the well known form of my Brother. I suppose it would be needless for me to express  our happiness in seeing him. for you are well aware that your fathers sons would ever recieve a hearty welcome from Father, Mother, Sister, andc. I have so much that I want to say to you that I very much fear I shall not say any thing of any consequence we have had uncomonly pleasant visit with Willford so far, and ^are^ especially pleased with his christian character, which is in perfect accordance with the word of God, and ^as^ for myself after striving with the assistance of the spirit of God to investigate the subject, which is looked upon by the worlds people, (and even those who consider themselves no more of the world) I very looked with contempt, permit, me to say, (by being brief) that I have "viz that of Mormonism  to be brief permit me to say I have concluded, the work, and that too I think ^know^ by the spirit of God) to be from the Lord, and of coure according unto the word, Willford has mentioned you I think, of the intended Baptism next sabbath. I really most want to go forward with others to recieve the ordinance and ^would^ you Dear Brother advise me not too supposing I felt it to be a duty incumbent upon me! I tell you what Asahel, I feel satisfied in my own mind, that I shall never enjoy more religion, if I am not willing to bear the cross and take up on me the name of Christ. would you for the fleeting honor and pleasures of this transitory world wish your only sister to barter, her souls salvation for the same, no.

I thought it might not be amiss to inform you about matters and things July 8th I visited our relatives in west street uncle Thadeus Thompson family and all the friends who appeared glad to see me. I spent the night with Uncle Titus Woodruff. I found them all well. Sunday 9th I visited Uncle Ozem Woodruff and was truly rejoiced to once more take him by the hand I preached at early candele light at the Lovly Street School house by Uncle Ozem's to a full congregation of relatives, neighbours, and old acquaint- ance they gave good attention and treated me with the best of friendships I spent the night with Uncle Collins ville and found the place had altered much since I lift left it, it was dull times with them no business going on excepting pulling down their shops and building greater they were making about $100,000 dollars of  repairs. I spent the day in visiting the place Uncle Ozem was at work on the stone dam across the river cousin Samuel Barber was treading and  doing well. I preached in the city hall at 5 oclock PM. to the inhabitants of Collinsville as I commenced speaking the drums commenced beating at the door's which continued for half an hour, their was some tumult in the house, however I preached them the word. Some few gave good attention such as Samuel Barber, Uncle Ozem, and (Jerry Humiston) ^xx^ who were present. I again preached on the 11th in the Lovly Street  School house upon the Authenticity of the Book of mormon their prejudice was broaken down they gave good attention and found no fault quite a number were quite believeing and three offered themselves for Babtism I suppose I must tell you who they were viz Ozem Woodruff. John Woodruff their Son I repaired to the water and baptized them with great joy and consolation  to my soul (thus ends that dream or vision which I had in Avon when about ten years of age). On the 12th I went to Simsbury to visit Aunt Cossetts family I had a very plesant visit with them ENDENTRY I found them all enjoying good health, Aunt Bulah not accepted. I was made wellcome not withstanding my principles which may appear to be dreadfull in the eyes of many of my friends  untill they have a true understanding of the matter but as soon as they have this privilege the direfull veil is rent from their eyes and they no longer consider Willford such a fated, desperate, and  dreadful monster or sunk in the lowest depths of vice darkness, error  degradation and infamy. I would to God that every relative I have were such as I am this day as touching spiritural things. Aunt Cossetts household receieved my teachings and the word and spirit bare record to the truth I had but a short time with them I spent one night and took the parting ^hand^ with them next day. 14th I again visited our Fathers hous in Farmington whare I had a happy privle interview not ownly with our parents but also Sister Eunice who had come home to visit me and my wife while at our fathers house. I ownly had time to take supper with them and then returned to Thadeus Thompson's.  15thI preached again at the School house by Uncle Ozems 16th Sunday I preached at Uncle's Adna Harts to a congregation composed of my relatives and former Neighbour ma^n^y from Cider Brook this was the last meeting I held in Avon. my stay among my friends was of necessity much shortedr than I could have wished. after the meeting closed I took the parting hand for the last time with many of our relatives Uncle Ozem. Cousin John. and Horatio. and many others I might name among them. I employed farmington those that had come out to attend the meeting such as Eunice, and Phebe my wife this was the first meeting they had attended of mine and after I arived at my fathers house. I concluded to spend the rest part of the time in visiting the old folks, and a happy visit it was to considering the shortness of it being three days ownly. I took several walks with Eunice and Phebe they seem to enjoy themselves well together we walked upon the canall and looked about the river whare we hole burned in paper used to fish when we were boys. it looked verry natural. I hear many enquiries about Asahel wherever he is known. On the 17th Miss Mary Ann Hills called to pay us a visit. she spent the afternoon and took tea with us she made enquiries about Asahel and seemed to be anxious to learn of his wellfare. 18th  I wrote an Acrostic for Eunice in her Abbum to remember me by. she is reserving a page for you to write when you come home.

I have your letter dated Nov 24 now before me, and it is with pleasure I spend a few moments in complying with its contents. In the first place I will give you a short sketch of things with me and then answer your qusestions. I took the steamer Bangor at Phebe my wife to again visit the Islands of the sea, we had not gone far before we saw the breakers most high we had a putty pretty rough time, most on board were sea sick. we landed at fox Islands the day following being the 2nd of Nov. I found the Saints strong in the faith. I have visited three Islands since I returned, and also the Maine land. I am labouring alone in the vineyard. But the work of God is manifesting itself at this time with great interest in our midst. The spirit of God if like fire in dry stubble  in our midst. The word of God is like a sharp two edged sword in the hearts of men. our congregations are large and profoundly attentive. The sea store is Throng'd when I baptize. Many are enquireing to know what they shall do to be saved. I have Baptized 19 since I returned to the Islands 7 of the No are sea captains. I baptized 2 sea captains and a Lady on New years Day, there is many ^that^ will soon follow their example here. There is now a door open for me to preach to all the neighbourning Islands, even to the gut of Magdalene Islands laying 800 or 1000 miles N.E. of fox Islands I think of going there early in the spring, and spending a few weeks  I am now on South fox Islands sitting and writing at the same table in com- pany with Mrs Woodruff with the sea spending its waves against the rocks a few rods from my feet. The ground is bare, the weather warm and pleasent. I walked out last eve and this morning with Phebe and viewed the sea shore, and stood for an hour upon a rocky turret viewing the sea foam beneath us. it speaks the power of God. Will you inform me when you write again if you receieve the Elders Journal. I should be pleased to have you perus that paper. I gave dire- ctions for it to be sent to ^you.^  Elders Sidney Rigdon spent a night in Terre Haute a short time since perhaps you did not see them. I shall expect to go to Missouri next fall, and shall probably pass through Terre Haute. If you ENDENTRY are there I shall probably see you. I am gratified to learn of your prosperity in temporal business, and I hope you will prosper in spiritual things before you die. You made one request in your letter concerning sister Eunice which I will answer with pleasure. In expressing myself to you upon that subject I shall speak in confidence and unreservedly for, I consider your request to be perfectly consistant with the interest you have taken in her well- fare. Brother Asahel you spoke of being disturbed in your subject by a person coming into the store I waited upon you in this will you give me the same privilege. Thomas Arey has just come across the bay with a wherry (what we used to call a skiff or boat) and wants Phebe and I to go home with him and spend the night he says he will bring us back in the morning and so I suppose I must go I will continue the subject in the morning. FIGURE Jan 6th I have  got back we had a good sail and a plesasent time. the son shines as warm as summer the water most as still as if nature had ceased to breathe the people say they never saw such weather here before in the winter FIGURE I am glad I did not fill this sheet last night for just as I came into Capt Coombs handed me two letters one of them was from Brother Asahel, Dated Terre Haute Dec 10th I have red it through and through, and there is much I would like to say concerning it hiad I time and room. I was glad to learn that you receieve the mormon papers. I sent word for the Elders Journal to be sent to you, I trust you will get it. You speak of not liking the stile and spirit of the letter from England for my part I see no impropriety in a servent of God expressing his desires for the wellfare of his family, if there is I have it yet to learn, however, I do not intend entering into any argument upon the subject. from your remark I conclude you have receieved the first no of the Elders Journal. Tehere now the captain has set a bowl of dried raisins before us to heinder me awhile. I hope Brother Asahel you will excuse this long adjunct flung in the face of Sister eunice. I will haste to answer your reasonable request  I wish you to bear in mind that Sister is advancing in life as well as ourselves and in giving you a description of her I can do no better than to state simple truth, which is the best in all cases. Sister Eunice was a child of about 11 years when I first left her in Colebrook the day before I left I took her by the hand and led her out on a walk of 15 or 20 minutes and gave her good advice the image of her childhood countenance remained on my mind and I could not bring any other appearance of her to my mind except the one she was clothed in when I shook her by the hand as a little girl to go to the west with Azmon, and this was always the case with me untill I returned last sum- mer to Colebrook and wraped at her school house door and I will will assume you Dear sir that wrap was made amid enexpressible sensations, when In an instant our ownly sister stood before me took me be the hand and saluted me with a kiss, then at that instant all of her former appearence her childish countenance departed from my mind and recollection like electricity, yea with the rapidity of lightning. and it is as much impossible for me now to recall and imagine in my mind how she look'd and appeared at 11 years of age as it would be for me to imagine how you will look and appear at 40 should you live untill that time, for you will beare in mind that a female receieves the greatest change from 11 to 17 or 18 of any period. On seeing Eunice I found her midling size in stature not tall, rather stocky, but of a pleasing form with the appearence of a young woman or Lady (not a child) I think she has the looks of Philo in her countenance. Wien I first had an interview with her she was vary resereve bordering upon a distance. I suppose because I was a Mormon priest. you ENDENTRY know the days have been and still are in some degree that a man might as well look for popularity in to-fet as among the gentiles with the appetation of mormon about tims or toth advocate the principles of Latter Day Saints. and that to because, the world do not believe the Bible. I have been surprised to see how fearful some of my relatives and old neighbours were of me in connecticut, they supposed I had turned into an Elep- fant, Hotantat, or an Arab, and I dont know but this is the case with you if it is I hope you will some day learn to the contrary, but I see I am of from my subject. I soon showed Sister Eunice by an easy appearence and familiararity that I was still Willford and I am happy to say that I had an uncommon agreeable visit with her although it was short, I am pleased to have a sister as well qualified to adorn and humour the female sect, character or circle, as I consider Eunice to ^be^. I have seen some of the world and it is verry seldom I have found a female making better appearence in company than Eunice she is graceful modest and appears to understand every crook and turn about right. I must confess ^xxx^ I admire her turn of mind in mose cases, one in particular, she is not elated with ribbons, ruffles, rings and ornamenting the body not that I think these is so much sin in these, but I am proud (if I may be allowed the expression) that my sisters mind is more noble. I discover some gems in her mind that most of females in riper years are destitute of. Do not understand me by this remark, concerning dress that Eunice does not dress rich neet, and tidy, or that her apperrel is not well aranged for she does. in speaking of her page torn- ections I did not discover but one and that we are all of us more or less ge page torn I mean lightness bordering upon what we call rudeness, but I was so cheerful  and sociable with her myself that I had no fa^u^lt to find with her upon that subject I think Brother Asahel she will answer your expectations and desires concerning her. I am in hopes with her outward accomplishments she will be a worshiper of the true and living GOD. I hope your advise to her will always incline her mind that way she is not insensible of the interest you are taking in her welfare and I hope you will yet have your reward by seeing her arise in life doing honour to her Brother, to virtue, to her parents, to all her relatives, to her country and her God. But I must dissmiss this subject for the present by saying that if your delight ins in the company of boys and girls in memory of your sister, I would say that season is past with her and the refinement of riper years would more suit case. I do not know that I have answered your expectations in replying to your qustions if ^not^ make further inquiries and I will do according to my abilities. I receeved your papers you sent me, I shall be pleased to still hear from you from time to time.

Brother Asahel  As I am called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defence of the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ, I am still under the necessity of making use of my pen to communicate to you all the information you get from me, as I am not permited at present to speak with you face to face. There is many things resting upon my mind, that I wish to communicate to you, even more than this sheet will contain: however I must be content by giving you a synopsis of some few of them. Firstly, I have two letters lying before me which are the productions of your pen, under date of July 22nd, and Sept 27th, 1837. And dear Brother you may rest assured it is with no small degree of satisfaction, that I am permitted to peruse and reperuse such letters from a Brother to whom I am bound by the ties of consanguinity; and in whose best and fina^a^l welfare I feel more deeply interested than any but mysefl ^12^ is aware of. It is truly a treat to ones soul to  receive a letter from a friend with whom he he has been long seperated: and been called to travel among strangers for years, and not permitted to behold with his eyes the change that time has brought upon the image and face of his friend and Brother. I never was more forcibly struck with the change of a friend produced in five years, than in Sister Eunice: and if the change is as great in Brother Asahel I should not know him were I to meet him in Terre Haute. Had I room, I should like to be more lengthy in this in speaking of both of your letters than my limits will now permit; suffice it to say they are both interesting to mye; And I have not a relative on earth with whom I more  desire an interview than with yourself, But when I shall have the privilege God ownly knows. I also receieved a letter from Mother dated Aug 23 which was interesting to me; they were all well andc. As concerning myself, I still enjoying my usual good health, peace, and contentment. {And am growing more and more formed in the faith in which I am engaged} I have thought of late in my private walks and mediatations, that there was not a happier man on earth than myself; except such as possess more of the spirit, knowledge, and wisdom of God, than I do; and I hope that class are many. I am honest in saying, that I feel my peace to be like a river. (do not understand me to intimate that my righteousness is great) I have every thing of a temporal nature that reason can demand, to eat, to drink. to wear, my friends are numerous. I am  not as yet much injured by my enemies. I have a wife that I love with all my heart and I have cause to do so. I am blessed in my spiritual calling in preaching the gospel whareever I go, the word is attended with spirit and power, souls are converted to God, {thousands seek  instructing at my mouth} and even the captains that trade in ships at sea are demanding baptism at my hands; the priests of the different religions and gospels of the day, are bitterly complaining that I  am hole burned in paper saping the verry foundation of their churches, and Holy religion andc. {shorthand} {shorthand} Ah say you Willford boasts pretty well. No dear Brother I have not made the above remarks in order to boast, for who am I, a poor, ignorant, weak, illiterate Willford. it is not I that have done these things alone. All these blessings of which I speak have been bestowed upon me from the hand of God, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ. I know it requires meekness, wisdom, and good sense in times of success and prosperity, in order to keep humble, and know and feel our prrper place. I do think the Blessings bestowed upon me of late have had a tendency to show me my own weakness, have pointed out the source from whence they came, and enable'd me to see that self exhaltation is not good or profitable. {shorthand}?  sideways text When you write to me inform me if you have any intelligence from Brother Azmon and his family Thom- pson andc I wrote to them from New Rowley but have not herd from them.

Also refreshed with every luxury of a Fathers house. I spent about ten days with these my new relatives and friends;: I spent the time plesantly with my companion in this new circle of friends composed of five Sisters, three Brothers, and a Father and Mother in Law with other appendages of relationship.

My wife has spent the early part of of her life teaching School, and for the last 7 years she has closely confined herself with her nedle to the Tailoress trade, at which business she was ingaged in at Kirtland when I became acquainted with her. After an intimate correspondence with her, I became convinced it was the will of God for us to become {bosom} freiiends I offered her my heart, it was accepted. We were joined in matrimony and we live happy. {Neither of us are very handsome but we both look well enough for we are as God made us} Phebe is small in stature, possesses an amiable disposition, is good enough for me; and sends her kindest respects to you accompanied with her unfeigned thanks for the interest you have manifested in her welfare; we both much desire to see you andc. andc.  On the 19th Aug; in company with Elder Jonathan H. Hale, I took the Steamer Bangor at Portland ^PoP. 16,000^ with the intention of visiting fox Islands. We left the Steam Boat at Owls Head and went aboard of a sloop which landed us up on the Islands at 2 oclock Sunday morning the 20th. It gave me rather singular feelings to be landed upon an Island of the Sea in the darkness of the night, being an intire stranger to all men in the region; however after wandering awhile over the rocks, we found a house we called and went to bed. We arose in the morning, made ourselves known as servants of God and asked if thaere was any religion or priests on the Island, we were informed there was a Baptist church, and Priest, and meetinghouse in the centre of the Island. I will give a brief note of the town  south fox Islands. The inhabitants are generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous and hospitable. The people get most of their living and wealth by fishing. the town fits out 10.7 licensed sail besides small crafts. North fox Island is 9 miles londg and 2 miles wide. Pop, 800. They have a post Office, one store, a baptist church and meeting house and a Priest. and four schoolhouses, and a grist mill. The land is a rather rocky and rough, yet there are many good farms which produces fine wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and grass which ais the staple productions. The timber is fir, spruice, hemlock, and birch. Sheep are the principal stock upon the Island. Gooseburies grow in great abundance.  South fox Island is one mile south of the North Island, and it comes as near being without any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would puzzle the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about 10 miles long and 5 broad, and it is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, and dales. Cut up into necks, and points, to make room for the cooves and harbours that run through and through the Island. one may form some little Idea of it, on learning that it is rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its wingdings. The Pop is 1000 they get their wealth entirely by fishing. They have some sheep, and some parts of the Island is under cultivation, but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants fish at New foundland and bring the fish home to this Island, and dry them upon their own flakes, and prepare them for market.: they supply the market annually with great quantities of dried fish, Mackerel, and boxed herren. They have two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, and a small branch of the Methodist Church and a priest. The timber the same as on North Island with the addition of Pine. There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves, and harbours, of these Islands, such as Whale, Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, Holloboat Cod, Pollock, Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Skate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Mutton fish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munk fish, Nurs fish, Sun fish, Sword fish, Thrasher,  Cat, Scuppos, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, Ling, Eels, Also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop, Mussles, Pincles, {shorthand} And Porposes, Seal, andc andc and many others not named.  I have seen two or three Whale in sight at once. I have caught Cod, Haddock, and Hake, as fast as I could throw out out one line and haul in another. I have stood on the wharf and caught Mackarael out of a large school as fast as I could throw in my hook into the water and pull it out, they would bite the bare hook. or take bate out of my fingers like chickens if I would hold it in the water I have been bathing in the salt water and seen numbers of Seal swiming around some of them near me with their heads out of water look like dogs. {shorthand} Thus stands a brief account of fox Islands ENDENTRY I now wish to call your attention back to the first day that I visited the Island. I said it was on Sunday and of course there was to be preaching in the Baptist Meeting house. I hastened to the place, meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon he came to the door, I informed him we were servants of God, had a message to the people, and wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. We were invited into the pulpet and our appointment given out. The priest finished his discourse; invited us home with him, gave us some refreshment. We presented him the Book of Mormon he did not at first object, was mild and said he would read it. He soon accompanied us to the meeting house, the congregation was assembled, and it was with peculiar feelings that I arose to address a congregation upon an Island of the Sea, to present before them the fullness of the everlasting gospel, and the authentitcity of the Book of Mormon, as it was the first time to my knowledge that an Elder of Latter Day Saints ever trod the sail of one of the Islands, or his voice herd by the inhabitants in procl- aiming the word fo God. I had the strictest attention of all, their appearance indicated a thought that they had herd strange things to day. When I closed I gave out an appointment for the four following evenings to be held in the several districts. to cut a long story short suffice it to say, they came out by hundreds, christian and sinner, captain and sailor, priest and people, the sound went abroad to the neighbouring Islands, their sails were soon spread to waft them o'er the deep to hear the tidings for themselves. During the first 14 days we delivered 19 discourses. Many began to believe. The two priests made friends like Pilate, they became alarmed, they began to oppose and rage, they had no influence over the people. The Baptist priest spent one Sunday in his meeting house without a soul to accompany him while I had a congregation; even his own church and deacon were attending our meeting,  investigating the subject, and inviting us to visit them. Vinalhaven never was as page torn stir'd up before, in peace or war. The priest imediately sent letters to the mainla page torn come over and help us or we fall {shorthand} The Baptist priest fearing page torn not come went after them himself, while while the Methodist priest came from the South Island and made open war against the Book of Mormon and our principals. I attended his meeting look a min- ute of his discours, and publicly answered his crooked remarks, and he returned home confounded soon the Baptist priest returned with several others and held a six days meeting, it did not take affect the mark was torn from the eyes of the people and they began to see clearly, after I had fairly set our principals before the people, I opened a door for Baptism and twelve offered themselves as candidates; We led them down into the sea and Baptized them and of a truth they returned rejoicing: two of the number were respectable sea captains. The cry from the neighbouring Islands soon entered our ears come over and preach to us. Some came from the Maine land to hear, and they believe and wish to be bap- tized, hundreds are believing, and many ready to be baptized. I visited South Island preached 10 times, returned to North Island, organized a small branch of the church, returned to the Main land, travled 200 miles with Elder Kirtland; took the parting hand with, {shorthand} He has gone to spend the winter in Kirtland. I returned to Father wife, whose company I am now enjoying. I shall return to Vinalhaven in few days to spend the winter. I shall not return west I think start of a year. I shall spend the time on these Islands and the maine land think for a year. I never before have seen such doors open for preaching, the courthouse in Camden is offered me to lecture in I shall except of the offer when I return, it is the nearest town to Vinalhaven Pop 6000 and a num- ber have offered themselves for baptism there. Ps. I wish you to direct all of your letters to Vinalhaven Maine, for the  present, as I shall make that my stand. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Tell me of any News you get from our frie- nds and also inform me if you get the M and Advocate now, the kirtland paper. I shall be glad to call and see you when I go west but there is a prospect now of it's being some time first. I shall however calculate to see my wife settled in Missouri before I leave this Continent, which may be sooner than I have calculated, we have now seven Elders in England apart of the twelve, and as soon as doors are open in first Seventy will follow the twelve into that country, and as I am  a member of that quorum I shall not hesitate to go when duty calls. That the blessings of heaven may attend you in every lawful calling. and that all things may work together for your good both temporal and spiritual is the prayer of your Brother  Willford Woodruff.

Scammans  had visited you in the west, and wished you to returned with them and spend the winter at your  Fathers untill my return, you having excepted the offer of course accounts for your being in New York.

But he said there was No arangements made with him about the flour. He says as far as their was any arrangements made with him about any business he attended to it, but what was left with Br Fielding he could not say anything about. I also read the lettr to Br Ward and he did not know of any business left with him but what he had attended to. It seems you left the payment of the flour with Fielding but he has not attended to it I do not know of any debts now standing against you in this country but the flour the names of the last that were shiped that had paid you were William Gittins and family they claimed £16.16.0 which was allowed them in their passage.  I spoke to Br Brown about his Box of hard ware that he shiped to you and I believe he has written for somebody els to pay duties and sell it for what it will fetch.

As to the work in this country it is still on the increase. the Churches generally are well umited united and increasing in Numbers. there are some few exception but whare this is the case it is for the want of faithful Elders to labour. I suppose the Saints in this country will now number near 11,000 thousands scattered over a vast country and their is but about six 6 American Elders that are in the whole field beside 2 or 3 of us at Liverpool and Hence their is much more labour resting upon me in answering a peck pack of letters or so Daily and keeping things in order than their would be if we could have one ^100^ hundred good wise Jusdicious men who had recceved their Endowment and would act for the good of the Kingdom I feel anxious  to see such a day that I can strike hands with men from Nauvoo who has recceved their Endowment that will come to my help. what Elders there are in the field here are doing Exceding well but are soon expecting to return Home and I will then nearly be left alone as far as labour in the vineyard a^i^s concerned.

Trusting you will give this document your earliest and  most careful consideration, and that you will return it by first mail  for insertion of the history I remain your fellow laborer (signed) Wilford Woodruff Historian. by Thomas Bullock. Clerk. ENDENTRY Historian's Office,  Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856  Elder John Taylor, Dear Brother,  We are very busy writing the history of the latter days of Joseph, and we have a great many conflicting statements on the subject, which renders it necessary for me to call in the aid of an eye and ear witness to enable me to do justice to it. You are the only person on earth who can render me this assistance; I shall therefore feel obliged if you will take the earliest opportunity to sit down with your Hon. colleague the Chief Historian, and write out an account of all the circumstances relating to this subject which came under your immediate observation or experience from the 20th June 1844 to the date of  your return from Nauvoo. Also please to give me the requisite information if you are able on the following points:  Who were the Apostates staying at Hamilton's Hotel at the time in question?  At what period did Robinson stop the mail?  Joseph, Willard, and yourself tasted of the wine which was fetched by the guard just previous to the martyrdom; did Hyrum taste of it?  Were you the mouth at prayer both evenings in jail? if not, who officiated the first night, if any?  You sung "A poor wayfaring man of grief" at a quarter past 3 PM of the 27th; was it Joseph or Hyrum who requested you to repeat it? I have always understood that you had no sooner finished singing it the second time than the firing commenced; if so there must have been a considerable interval between the two exercises. What were the facts?  Who washed the bodies in Carthage?  Who nailed the boards together in which to take the bodies to Navuoo? ENDENTRY Historian's Office, Great Salt Lake City, May 28th 1856  Dear Bror. O. Pratt,  As I commence my first letter in the Historian's Office, I feel that you are the person that I should write to.  You may be aware that on Monday, the day before I parted with you at the mouth of the Kanyon, that I had an ox die suddenly, and in my endeavors to save the hide, while skinning it, I casually scratched my left arm with a rib, and a few days afterwards the place inflamed; a swelling rose on the spot, the poison virus got inoculated into my system, which caused me 3 to 4 weeks' sickness, and which came very near costing me my life. About the first labor on my recovering so as to be able to get out of doors, was to be called up about midnight on Thursday the 15th. inst to administer to your wife Sarah; I promised her in the name of the Lord that all should be well with her and her child, and she should be blest in her labor. In 15 minutes after she was safely delivered of a very fine daughter, weighing 12 lbs. I have seen her several times since, both she and her daughter are doing well. I have now so far recovered from my sickness as to be able to attend to business.  Eighteen days ago the mail arived from the East, being the first news by way of the South Pass since last November; the Carrier only brought in about one half of the bags sent from Independence Using that line; the other half being cached somewhere between there and here; perhaps left at Fort Laramie to amuse the U. S. soldiers with our news and correspondence during the winter evenings.  The California mail has arrived pretty regularly this winter; by that  mail we receive the Western Standard, and letters from Bro Rich ENDENTRY Great Salt Lak City June 1st 1857  Brother Thompson  Dear Sir  The Eastern Mail has finally arrived on the 29.

What were their names, distinguishing those who were turned back by Governor Ford?  Dan Jones makes the following statement: "We were awoke during the night of the 26th by heavy treads as of soldiery close by, and heard a whispering under the window 'who shall go in? how many shall go in? andc'.  They came up stairs to the prison door, ^against^ which we had taken the precaution to place a chair; hearing us speaking to each other they hesitated, when Joseph called out, 'come on ye assassins! we are ready for you, and would as willingly die now as at daylight!' Hearing this they retired again."  Do you know anything of this, and if so, how far is the statement correct?  Jones says that he was sent down stairs by Joseph the first thing next morning to ascertain the cause of the disturbances in the night, and was addressed by the officer of the guard (Frank Worrell) as follows: "we have had too much trouble to bring old Joe here to let him ever escape alive, and unless you want to die with him you had better leave before sundown; and you are not a damned bit better than him for taking his part, and you'll see that I can prophesy better than old Joe, for neither he nor his brother, nor any one who will remain with them will see the sun set to day."  He says Joseph then directed him to go to Governor Ford and inform him of what had taken place, and what had been said by the officer of the guard. How much of this is correct?  Jones says that the last words spoken on the evening of the 25th after you had all retired to rest were by Joseph as follows: "Now see who will have the most intelligent dream to night, brethren"; and that on awakening next morning Joseph enquired who had the dream; when Jones himself related one as follows: "Pourtrayed before my mind was Governor Ford and his troupe on their way across the prairie to Nauvoo.

The Presidency and those of the Twelve who are here are enjoying good health; they with the Council remember you in their prayers.  There are a few sick among us; among them Sister Mary Ann Young and Mary Richards, who are a little easier to day.  Elder McCarthy, who was shipwrecked on one of the Society Islands has baptized the interpreter to the King; he speaks 12 languages. Also the interpreter to the Government Company, who speaks 5 languages. Bro. McCarthy ordained them both Elders, and set them to preaching the gospel in the midst of the people; so some good is growing out of his shipwreck.

Do you remember this? and if not, what is your opinion respecting it?
