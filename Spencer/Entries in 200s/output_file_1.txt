My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey &amp; of the country &amp;c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times &amp; the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern country. Signs, wonders, &amp; fearful sights are appearing, &amp; the words of the Ancient &amp; modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London  so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford’s bog land rose up from its mighty bed &amp; travled with the rapidity  of a steam Engine for the distance of  angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over  &amp; in addition to these &amp; many other signs  of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen &amp; parliment depend upon the M to protect them, &amp; they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel  war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going through the streets begging Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories &amp; out of  Employ &amp; bread in one day, &amp; I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting  what to do, &amp; in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity &amp; sin as well as trouble &amp; distress &amp; it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &amp;c. for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort the Saints to be as quiet as possible &amp; be subject to the Laws of the Land &amp; the powers that be. but it  requires the greatest of prudence &amp; wisdom to hold public meetings &amp; do the work of God in this country at the present time &amp; under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe &amp; must spedily be   ENDENTRY  more &amp; more whare it is faithfully proclaimed &amp; signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I  believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in Birmingham &amp; that all of the capitol  places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth  to come forth from some quarter &amp; they appear willing to hear, receive &amp; imbrace it when it comes unto  them &amp; while we are preaching &amp; baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to  preach &amp; baptize in Scotland &amp; thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week &amp; several times on the  Sabbath &amp; baptize almost daily. Jan 27 came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon- ism unveiled John F Boyanton Boynton.  the man was a Methodist preacher &amp; brought the constables with him because he feared the people.

Our little Will ford is a verry bright looking child with dark eyes his hair almost exactly the colour of yours. Sarah E. is as bright as ever and highly delighted with the babe. I often think how pleased you would be to see him and how happy we might be with our little family if you could be at home with us–may the Lord grant that it may soon be the case. Was I surroun ded by thousands I should in one sense be like the lonely dove that mourns her absent mate, who from hill, to hill, from vale, to vale, her sorrows doth relate. As my babe lay seeping sweetly on my arm thes^e^ words came to my mind I write them just as they come to my mind.

I think that I shall have quite a present for you when you return if we are spared all of us to see each other. I have lately received a letter from Father Foss wrote in it, they they much desire a visit from you when you return, could you not take a ship bound for N.Y.  and pass two or three days there, they all much regretted my not comeing home and passing the time of your absence with them. Father tells me if I  am ever in want to come to his house where I shall find an asylum – sister  Foss wants you to take Ichabod if you come that way – Mother says that she expects to loose Mary failes more and more. I have not heard from father Woodruff's family since you left. I heard that Sarah Milliken was expecting to be married to a man out of the  church and likewise intemperate the sisters about here, wished me to write to her on the subject I did, mentioning sister Eliza Grants case to her but have received no   sometime writing it. Will. is laying looking at me as I write in my lap ENDENTRY  not well help it, for I felt interested in her wellfare as we have been so intimately acquainted. I told you in my other letter that I had been liveing by the wayside as it were since you left me, I have moved 4 times since you, left home; that is  something for one whose health was as feeble as mine. I moved from Montrose to brother Clarke's then into a small house of his in the same door yard, just before I was confined–I chose to  go there that I might be more retired. I had every thing at that time that was necessary to make me comfortable and have been much blest of the Lord. I missed you much more at that time than before Oh! thought I if I could but have my Willford to call on instead of strangers what a comfort it would be to me but that time is past and over now, thank the Lord for it. Your prayer was answered in my haveing friends to stand by me when I needed them – the brethren are verry kind about here likewise the family where I now live. I shall probably stay where I am untill you return – father Clark says that you need not be concerned about ^me^ untill you get back only pray for me, he is verry kind.   one to join us – sister Maine – she tries to observe the time &amp; although far distant from each other we have the same God to call on,  the prayer of his children. We know not how to appreciate blessings untill we are deprived of them. We often see people who are permitted to live togather men to stay at home with their families but me thinks they do not realize their privileges. I often look on such families around me and think how happy they must be but I suppose they do not realize it, I even look on black Jack and  think if I could have my Willford live at home ^with^ me even if we had to work verry hard I should not mind or value that for then we might enjoy our humble pittance ^in^ each other's society which gives a relish to every blessing. You prob- ably remember our last ride togather out to brother Hawley's settlement to see our little Sarah, the prairies were most delightfuly clothed with flowers and  verdure and I thought it the most pleasent ride we ever had togather, the sabbath following I rode out to the same place in company with a number of others to a meeting and to see Sarah the flowers were there but they with every thing else were dressed in gloom and looked lonely as I felt, nothing looked cheerful but my little Sarah, I found her health much improved which was  much satisfaction to me – these with many other reflections pass and repass through my mind – but in the midst of them something whispers Phebe do you want your companion to come home to you before he has filled his pres- ent mission my heart answers  wait his  ENDENTRY  sake.   the third letter I have written you since I received any from you.

I am surpris- ed you have not hit upon it long before now, it is not against the principles of your faith;  and is nothing worse than what your people voted for in the late Constitution, yet the scheme is such that the Gentiles can not possibly discover the trick at all, if you but have from 25 to 50 thousand of  your people you can depend upon; that would do as you tell them, when you first get to hear it you will be extremely glad as it will save you from de- struction and disgrace, and would cause all of your ENDENTRY  and it would bring tens of thousands of people into your Church, because they would think you in- spired indeed, and it would be worth untold milli- ons of dollars into the Church treasury.   if Utah became a State, that such would be the prestige you would have, that the above would result; and if you but will carry out my scheme, Utah is bound to be a state in a few years at most. I have no possible interest in your Church, as I look upon it as a fraud "from the  word go." but if you will pay me handsomely, say: $200,000 00/100 I will tell you said scheme, if you do not act upon this you have better  make up your mind to: that your Church will go to destruction because of the failures of Smiths Prophesies, but if Utah becomes a state those failures will be forgotten.   it must be kept absolutely secret, exept to those initiated, if it becomes public it will fail.

I beheld my sister my ownly sister, seventeen years of age adorned with youth, modesty, and lovliness with her face veiled with the true picture of PHILO. with a degree of admiration I gazed upon the change five years had brought upon HER. HER sprightly step with energy was marked while teaching the youth. To more perfectly call to mind the rec ollection of youth and past scenes &amp; to entertain my mind amid the passing hours, this sister presented me (with a cheerful grace) a bundle of Letters from an absent brothers I looked them through and through they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters I read fifteen in number to Eunice directed. They brought to my soul as great a variety of feeling as matter they contained. They presented to my view, the display of a cultivated mind &amp; the refined talents of a brother presented to a sister with the most untarnished friendship and deepest feeling for her wel- lfare that can grace the human soul. Such teachings as these to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would deliver them from a thousand snares. The name of Willford was mentioned oft Asahel had not forgotten him. (O heaven pro tect my Parents my Brethren &amp; my sister) While at once I viewed this three years convers of Asahel, I smiled, I wept.   these teachings they will lead thee in the paths of safty. I left the house and by my sisters side I viewed the Colebook land- scapes as we walked. my soul was pressed. O I spake of Asahel, I thought of him, I asked what he would say if he knew whare we were. ah says Eunice he would wish to be here. We visited our parents dwelling at sages mill, but they had gone to Farmington we entered the, house and found all as emty, vacant, silent &amp; still as death. Not a parent or brother to salu te, we entered the chamber &amp; saw the work of Asahels hands but nothing left but a stick balanced by a string in the closet to hold his coat. it was to gloomy to tarry long I droped a tear and retired believing it more pleasent on the banks of the Missouri I took a drink from the well while depart- ing Eunice plucked each of us a, rose as we left we walked up the hill while the stones, stumps, hills &amp; dales, looked natural.

I know &amp; bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ that the Book of mormon is the revealed will of God, &amp; also that Joseph Smith jr is a prophet of God, &amp; that the Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts &amp; graces. I know the same signs now follow the believers that did anciently &amp; as I have prooven this work &amp; know it to be true for myself, I am entirely unshaken in its work &amp; in consquence of this, my soul being wrap'd in the work, when I have written to any of my friends (yourself not excepted) I have principly written upon the subject &amp; this is why I say, perhaps I have been to tegious tedious in my letters to you. But I do not wish to burthen any, of my friends in this or any other way. my ownly motive for not writing to Azmon more than I have since I have been travling, was because I thought they might not be entertaining to him at this time. I have written vary plain to Azmon in one Letter it is true, But I have nothing in my breast against him or any relatives I have in the world.

I also speak of our safety fund that I took some shares in that, now why I speak of this is, I did not know but you might draw the idea that I had left the gospel &amp; gone to speculating but this is not the case. I feel that the spirit that rolls in my veins is steadfast upon the subject, &amp; I shall go  or death before I shall renounce it the reason of this remark is because I know it to be true. But enough upon this subject at this time. Now Brother Asahel for heavens sake do not think that I have drop'd a remark in this letter to cast any reflections upon you or any body els I have none to cast. Shall it be said that we must be seperated in feelings &amp;  ties of consanguinity severed because we may not think alike upon religious subjects let God forbid, I love you.

I perused your letter of Nov 20 much satisfaction. The account you gave of your ministry upon the "Island of the Sea" in that communication together with other particulars in your last letter to me enables me to form a pretty just estimate of the result of your labors. I am happy my beloved brother to assure you that I rejoice in the success of those ministers of the gospel of the Son of God who are not ashamed to declare the truth in opposition to popular error. And although I confess myself an incompetent judge of the merits of the "faith" of the "Latter Day Saints" as a system of religion yet, I entertain an erroneous impression if the struggle between popular secta- -rianism ^(2)^ and "Mormonism" ^(1)^  is not a strife between liberty of speech and toleration in religious opinion and their antipodes – dumb  education and the trammels of an illiberal bigotry.   of your friends on account (as you suppose) of your odd religious profession. That the deportment of some of them should be affected in some degree by this circumstance seems to me very natural and indeed when we consider how  it is for most persons under the circumstances to appreciate properly the character and motives of the "Saints" it is reasonable to expect th make wry faces. I do not however suppose that in the care of your early acquaintances you have just grounds for doubting their respect and confidence for as far as I am acquainted with their views they give you much credit for your devotion to such a cause. There is perhaps nothing  the world as the misconstructions that are put upon ENDENTRY  and consequently our motives are misappreciated (if I may manufacture a term). I am apt to imagain that the world is not half so bad as it appears to be though I must confess my conviction that many persons are far worse than they seem. We do not know the motives by which men are governed in their intercouse with us and hence when their conduct is  and interest we set them down as bad men, while perhaps at the same time they are only opposing to our selfish views the purest principles of their integrity In refference to your leaving Richland and joining the "Mormons" I received my first impression either directly or indirectly from brother Azmon  have felt a deeper interest in a  He was grieved and his friends sympathised with his sorrow and I in the tenderness of my heart conoled with him.

You will find it in the imperfection of human nature. And in appealing to you for your charity – to your brother for his confidence. I have no doubt I shall meet a ready response. And formy folly I hesitate not to believe you will both find an excuse in my apology.

I would here remark that a person situated as I am in life &amp; calling knows not whare the morrow will find him at all times. I have of late held two conferences in Vinalhaven one upon each Island &amp; organized a Church in each place both containing about fifty members &amp; so they are now in a situation to attend to their meetings without me I have concluded to leave them for a season &amp; in consequence of recieving some intelligence of interest from the City of P.

The work of the Lord is progressing with great rapidity &amp; power  in the City of N Y. under the preaching of Elder Pratt he is now Baptizing in the city by day &amp; night he has the use of two meeting houses &amp; also Tammany's Hall the most noted Hall in the City which is freely furnished and advertized at the expens of the Infidels as the Priests are disposed to call them the work is spreading in the county as well as City some come 20 or 30 miles to hear and obey the gospel &amp; the calls are more numerous than they can possibly attend to. As to opposition the City is in a general uproar in many parts Priests many of them rage and foam &amp; go to such lengths that every honest man is under the necessity of coming out from them. The Saints are firm in the City &amp; are ready to suffer death for Christs sake &amp; the truths. I do not know the number Baptized in the City Elder Pratt writes in his last that 75 have been added &amp; that the work has but just begun &amp; sayes we are crouded beyond conception - two pamphlets &amp; many papers are filled against us but all tends to give us the attention of the people The Editor of the Zions Watchman is vary busy against  us &amp; his paper is teeming with falshood &amp; misrepresentation.

You speak of not liking the stile &amp; spirit of the letter from England for my part I see no impropriety in a servent of God expressing his desires for the wellfare of his family, if there is I have it yet to learn, however upon the subject. from your remark I conclude you have receieved the first no of the Elders Journal. T now the captain has set a bowl of dried raisins before us to h excuse this long    &amp; in giving you a description of her I can do no better than to state simple truth, which is the best in all cases. Sister Eunice was a child of about 11 years when I first left her in Colebrook the day before I left I took her by the hand &amp; led her out on a walk of 15 or 20 minutes &amp; gave her good advice the image of her childhood countenance remained on my mind &amp; I could not bring any other appearance of her to my mind except the one she was clothed in when I shook her by the hand as a little girl to go to the west with Azmon, &amp; this was always the case with me untill I returned last sum- mer to Colebrook &amp; wraped at her school house door &amp; I will  sir that wrap was made amid enexpressible sensations, when In an instant our ownly sister stood before me took me be the hand &amp; saluted me with a kiss, then at that instant all of her former appearence her childish countenance departed from my mind &amp; recollection like electricity, yea with the rapidity of lightning. &amp; it is as much impossible for me now to recall &amp; imagine in my mind how she look'd &amp; appeared at 11 years of age as it would be for me to imagine how you will look &amp; appear at 40 should you live untill that time, for you will b female receieves the greatest change from 11 to 17 or 18 of any period. On seeing Eunice I found her midling size in stature not tall, rather stocky, but of a pleasing form with the appearence of a young woman or Lady (not a child) I think she has the looks of Philo in her countenance. Wien I first had an interview with her she was vary resereve bordering upon a distance.

I soon showed Sister Eunice by an easy appearence &amp; familiararity that I was still Willford &amp; I am happy to say that I had an uncommon agreeable visit with her although it was short, I am pleased to have a sister as well qualified to adorn and humour the female sect, character or circle, as I consider  some of the world &amp; it is verry seldom I have found a female making better appearence in company than Eunice she is graceful modest &amp; appears to understand every crook &amp; turn about right. I must confess ^xxx^ I admire her turn of mind in mose cases, one in particular, she is not elated with ribbons, ruffles, rings &amp; ornamenting the body not that I think these is so much sin in these, but I am proud (if I may be allowed the expression) that my sisters mind is more noble. I discover some gems in her mind that most of females in riper years are destitute of. Do not understand me by this remark, concerning dress that Eunice does not dress rich neet, &amp; tidy, or that her apperrel is not well aranged for she does. in speaking of her page torn- ections I did not discover but one &amp; that we are all of us more or less ge page torn I mean lightness bordering upon what we call rudeness, but I was so cheerful  &amp; sociable with her myself that I had no fa^u^lt to find with her upon that subject I think Brother Asahel she will answer your expectations &amp; desires concerning her.

I hope your advise to her will always incline her mind that way she is not insensible of the interest you are taking in her welfare &amp; I hope you will yet have your reward by seeing her arise in life doing honour to her Brother, to virtue, to her parents, to all her relatives, to her country &amp; her God. But I must dissmiss this subject for the present by saying that if your delight i say that season is past with her &amp; the refinement of riper years would more suit case.

There is many things resting upon my mind, that I wish to communicate to you, even more than this sheet will contain: however I must be content by giving you a synopsis of some few of them. Firstly, I have two letters lying before me which are the productions of your pen, under date of July 22 dear Brother you may rest assured it is with no small degree of satisfaction, that I am permitted to peruse &amp; reperuse such letters from a Brother to whom I am bound by the ties of consanguinity; &amp; in whose best &amp; fina^a^l welfare I feel more deeply interested than any but mysefl ^12^ is aware of. It is truly a treat to ones soul to  receive a letter from a friend with whom he he has been long seperated: and been called to travel among strangers for years, and not permitted to behold with his eyes the change that time has brought upon the image &amp; face of his friend &amp; Brother. I never was more forcibly struck with the change of a friend produced in five years, than in Sister Eunice: and if the change is as great in Brother Asahel I should not know him were I to meet him in Terre Haute. Had I room, I should like to be more lengthy in this in speaking of both of your letters than my limits will now permit; suffice it to say they are both interesting to m desire an interview than with yourself, But when I shall have the privilege  knows. I also receieved a letter from Mother dated Aug 23 which was interesting to me; they were all well &amp;c. As concerning myself, I still enjoying my usual good health, peace, &amp; contentment. {And am growing more and more formed in the faith in which I am engaged} I have thought of late in my private walks and mediatations, that there was not a happier man on earth than myself; except such as possess more of the spirit, knowledge, &amp; wisdom of God, than I do; &amp; I hope that class are many. I am honest in saying, that I feel my peace to be like a river. (do not understand me to intimate that my righteousness is great) I have every thing of a temporal nature that reason can demand, to eat, to drink. to wear, my friends are numerous. I am  not as yet much injured by my enemies. I have a wife that I love with all my heart &amp; I have cause to do so. I am blessed in my spiritual calling in preaching the gospel whareever I go, the word is attended with spirit and power, souls are converted to God, {thousands seek  instructing at my mouth} &amp; even the captains that trade in ships at sea are demanding baptism at my hands; the priests of the different religions &amp; gospels of the day, are bitterly complaining that I  am hole burned in paper saping the verry foundation of their churches, &amp; Holy religion &amp;c. {shorthand} {shorthand} Ah say you Willford boasts pretty well. No dear Brother I have not made the above remarks in order to boast, for who am I, a poor, ignorant, weak, illiterate Willford. it is not I that have done these things alone. All these blessings of which I speak have been bestowed upon me from the hand of God, and if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ. I know it requires meekness, wisdom, &amp; good sense in times of success &amp; prosperity, in order to keep humble, &amp; know &amp; feel our prrper place. I do think the Blessings bestowed upon me of late have had a tendency to show me my own weakness, have pointed out the source from whence they came, &amp; enable'd me to see that self exhaltation is not good or profitable. {shorthand}?   pson &amp;c I wrote to them from New Rowley but have not herd from them.

Hale, I took the Steamer Bangor at Portland ^PoP. 16,000^ with the intention of visiting fox Islands. We left the Steam Boat at Owls Head &amp; went aboard of a sloop which landed us up on the Islands at 2  Sunday morning the 20 upon an Island of the Sea in the darkness of the night, being an intire stranger to all men in the region; however after wandering awhile over the rocks, we found a house we called &amp; went to bed. We arose in the morning, made ourselves known as servants of God &amp; asked if thaere was any religion or priests on the Island, we were informed there was a Baptist church, &amp; Priest, &amp; meetinghouse in the centre of the Island. I will give a brief note of the town   are generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous &amp; hospitable. The people get most of their living &amp; wealth by fishing. the town fits out 10.7 licensed sail besides small crafts. North fox Island is 9 miles lon meeting house &amp; a Priest. &amp; four schoolhouses, &amp; a grist mill. The land is a rather rocky &amp; rough, yet there are many good farms which produces fine wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, &amp; grass which  upon the Island. Gooseburies grow in great abundance.   near being without any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would puzzle the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about 10 miles long &amp; 5 broad, and it is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, &amp; dales. Cut up into necks, and points, to make room for the cooves &amp; harbours that run through &amp; through the Island. one may form some little Idea of it, on learning that it is rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its win of the Island is under cultivation, but it is at the expens of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants fish at New foundland &amp; bring the fish home to this Island, &amp; dry them upon their own flakes, and prepare them for market fish, Mackerel, &amp; boxed herren. They have two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, &amp; a small branch of the Methodist Church &amp; a priest. The timber the same as on North Island with the addition of Pine. There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves, &amp; harbours, of these Islands, such as Whale, Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, Holloboat Cod, Pollock, Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Alewives, Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Skate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Mutton fish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munk fish, Nurs fish, Sun fish, Sword fish, Thrasher,  Cat, Scuppos, Tootog, Eye fish, Cunner, Ling, Eels, Also Lobsters, Clams, Scollop, Mussles, Pincles, {shorthand} And Porposes, Seal, &amp;c &amp;c &amp; many others not named.   throw out out one line &amp; haul in another.

I hastened to the place, meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon he came to the door, I informed him we were servants of God, had a message to the people, &amp; wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. We were invited into the pulpet &amp; our appointment given out. The priest finished his discourse; invited us home with him, gave us some refreshment. We presented him the Book of Mormon he did not at first object, was mild &amp; said he would read it. He soon accompanied us to the meeting house, the congregation was assembled, &amp; it was with peculiar feelings that I arose to address a congregation upon an Island of the Sea, to present before them the fullness of the everlasting gospel, &amp; the authenti the Book of Mormon, as it was the first time to my knowledge that an Elder of Latter Day Saints ever trod the sail of one of the Islands, or his voice herd by the inhabitants in procl- aiming the word fo God. I had the strictest attention of all, their appearance indicated a thought that they had herd strange things to day. When I closed I gave out an appointment for the four following evenings to be held in the several districts. to cut a long story short suffice it to say, they came out by hundreds, christian &amp; sinner, captain &amp; sailor, priest &amp; people, the sound went abroad to the neighbouring Islands, their sails were soon spread to waft them o'er the deep to hear the tidings for themselves. During the first 14 days we delivered 19 discourses. Many began to believe. The two priests made friends like Pilate, they became alarmed, they began to oppose &amp; rage, they had no influence over the people. The Baptist priest spent one Sunday in his meeting house without a soul to accompany him while I had a congregation; even his own church &amp; deacon were attending our meeting,  investigating the subject, &amp; inviting us to visit them. Vinalhaven never was as page torn stir'd up before, in peace or war. The priest imediately sent letters to the mainla page torn come over &amp; help us or we fall {shorthand} The Baptist priest fearing page torn not come went after them himself, while while the Methodist priest came from the South Island &amp; made open war against the Book of Mormon &amp; our principals.

The cry from the neighbouring Islands soon entered our ears come over &amp; preach to us. Some came from the Maine land to hear, &amp; they believe &amp; wish to be bap- tized, hundreds are believing, &amp; many ready to be baptized. I visited South Island preached 10 times, returned to North Island, organized a small branch of the church, returned to the Main land, travled 200  spend the winter in Kirtland. I returned to Father wife, whose company I am now enjoying. I shall return to Vinalhaven in few days to spend the winter. I shall not return west I think start of a year.
