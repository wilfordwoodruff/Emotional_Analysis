The Saints need not   think because I am familiar with them   & am playful & cheerful that I am ignorant   of what is going on inipuity cannot   be retained in the Church of any kind   & it will not fare well whare I am for   I am determined while I do lead the   Church to lead them right      Br Joseph further remarked as concerning   Elder Adams that he had given   satisfactions to him concerning the things   whareof he was accused he had confesced   all wharein he had done wrong & had asked   for mercy & he had taken the right course   to save himself that he would now begin new   in the Church. After much instruction   was given from Joseph the Council adjour  ned.      May 28, 1843 ~ Sunday      28th I spent the time at home quite unwell      May 29, 1843 ~ Monday to May 31, 1843 ~ Wednesday      29th 30 & 31 I spent my time about my   building & at Printing Office

 his commission as a messenger of peace   and salvation as one of the Lord's noble   men I can fervently say may the Lord   clear his way before him, and bless him,  and bless those that obey his teachings   wherever there are ears to hear & hearts to   feel. He is in the language of the Hebrews   -[✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦]-  (Hau-ra-ang yeesh-rau-ale) The friend   of Israel and worthy to be received and   entertained as a man of God: yea he has as   had the ancient Apostle O'✦✦✦✦✦ O'✦✦✦✦✦  (ologos ohales) the good word: that that   leadeth unto eternal Life Laus Deus.   Prraise God.      Wherefore brethren and friends   while you hear the assurance of the integrity,   fidelity, and ability of this servant of the   living GOD, trusting that your hearts and   energies will be enlivened and deeply engaged   in the building of these houses, directed by Revelat-  ion for the Salvation of all Saints; and that you   will not rest whare you are untill all things are   prepared before you and you are gatherd home   with the rest of Israel to meet your God; I feel   strong in the belief and have a growing expectation   that you will not withhold any means in your   power that can be used to accomplish this   Glorious work. Finally as one that greatly desires   the salvation of man; let me remind you all   to strive with a godly zeal for virtue, holiness,   and the commandments of the Lord, Be good,   Be wise, be just, be liberal; and above all be char-  itable always abounding in all good works     
 And may health peace and the love of God   our Father and the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord   be and abide with you all is the sincere Prayer   of your devoted brother & friend   In the everlasting gospel      JOSepH Smith      City of Nauvoo  June 1st 1843      June 2, 1843 ~ Friday to June 3, 1843 ~ Saturday      June 2 & 3 Spent the time in building my   house.      June 4, 1843 ~ Sunday      4th Sunday I spent the time at home writing      June 5, 1843 ~ Monday to June 10, 1843 ~ Saturday      5, 6, 7, 8, 9, & 10, I Spent the week labouring   on my house on Saturday we got the   walls of the sullar up & put on our lower   Joist & were ready for the brick work but   shall be under the necessity of suspending   operations on the house for one week   for the want of brick      June 11, 1843 ~ Sunday      June 11th A large assembly of Saints met at   the Temple & were addressed by President   Joseph Smith. He took for the foundation   of his discourse the words of Jesus to the   Jews how oft would I have gatherd you   togetherd as a hen gathereth her chickens under   wings But ye would not &c. He then asked   what was the object of Gathering the Jews   together or the people of God in any age of the   world, the main object was to build unto the     
 Lord an house whereby he could reveal   unto his people the ordinances of his house   and glories of his kingdom & teach the peopl  the ways of salvation for their are certain   ordinances & principles that when they are   taught and practized, must be done in a place   or house built for that purpose this was   purposed in the mind of God before the   world was & it was for this purpose that God   designed to gather together the Jews oft   but they would not it is for the same   purpose that God gathers together the people   in the last ^days^ to build unto the Lord an house to   prepare them for the ordinances & endowments   washings & anointings &c one of the   ordinances of the house of the Lord is Baptism   for the dead, God decreed before the foundation   of the world that that ordinance should   be administered in a house prepared for that   purpose. If a man gets the fulness of God he has   to get [it] in the same way that Jesus Christ obta-  ined it & that was by keeping all the ordin-  ances of the house of the Lord. Men will   say I will never forsake you but will   stand by you at all times but the moment   you teach them some of the mysteries of God   that are retained in the heavens and are   to be revealed to the children of men when   they are prepared, They will be the first   to stone you & put you to death. It was the   same principle that crusified the Lord   Jesus Christ. I will say sumthing about the   Spirits in prision, theire has been much   said about the sayings of Jesus on the cross   to the thief saying this day thou shalt   be with me in paradise. The commentators 
 make or translators make it out to say   Paradise but what is Paradise it is a modern   word it does not answer at all to the original   that Jesus made use of, their is nothing   in the original in any language that signif-  ies Paradise. But it was this day I will   be with thee in the world of spirits & will   teach thee or answer thy inquiries. The   thief on the cross was to be with Jesus   Christ in the world of spirits he did not   say Paradise or heaven. The doctrin   of Baptism for the dead is clearly shown   in the new testament & if the doctrin   is not good then throw away the new testa  ment but if it is the word of God then   let the doctrin be acknowledged & it was   one reason why Jesus said how oft would   I have gatherd you (the Jews) together   that they might attend to the ordinance   of the baptism for the dead as well as   the other ordinances the Priesthood   Revelations &c. This was the case on the   day of Pentecost these blessings were   poured out upon the deciples, on that   occasion.   Their has been also much   said about the word Hell & the sectarian   world have preached much about it   but what is hell, it is annother modern   term it is taken from hades, the greek   or shaole, the (hebrew) & the true sig-  nification is a world of spirits,   Hades shaole paradise, spirits in prision   is all one it is a world of spirits, the   righteous & the wicked all go to the same   world of spirits     
 but says one I believe in one hell & one   heaven all are equally miserable or equally   happy, but St Paul informs us of three   glories & three heavens he knew a man   caught up to the third heavens, & Jesus   said their were many mansions in my   Fathers kingdom. Any man may believe   Jesus Christ is good & be happy in it & yet   not obey his commands & at last be cut   down by his righteous commandmends   A man of God should be endowed with   all wisdom knowledge & understanding   in order to teach & lead people. The blind   may lead the blind & both fall into the   deatch together;      Their is much   said concerning God the Godhead &c   the scripture says their is Gods many &   Lords many, the teachers of the day   say that the father is God the son is God   & the Holy Ghost is God & that they are   all in one body & one God. Jesus says or   prays that those that the father had   given him out of the world might be   made one in us as we, are one, but if   they were to be stuffed into one person   they would make a great God. If I   were to testify that the world was   wrong on this point it would be   true. Peter says that Jesus Christ   sat on the right hand of God any   person that has seen the heavens   opened knows that their is three   personages in the heavens holding     
 the keys of power. As the father   hath power in himself so the Son   hath power, in himself then the   father has some day laid down his body   & taken it again ^so he has a body of his own^ So has his Son a body of   his own so each one will be in their own   body.  Many of the sects cry out O I   have the testimony of Jesus I have the spirit   of God. But away with Jo Smith he says he   is a Prophet But their is to be no Prophets   nor revelations in the last days; But   stop sir the Revelator says that the testimony   of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so by your   own mouth you are condemned.      But to the text why gather the people together   in this place for the same purpose that   Jesus wanted to gather the Jews, to receive   the ordinances, the blessings & the glories   that God has in store for his Saints. And   I would now ask this assembly and all the   Saints if they will now build this house   & receive the ordinances & blessings which   God has in store for you, or will you not   build unto the Lord this house & let him pass   by & bestow these blessings upon another   I pause for a reply      After Joseph closed Elder Cutler spoke   concerning the Temple & also the Death of   Elder Elias Higby one of the Temple Committee   who Died June 8th 1843 Aged 47 years 7 month   and 17 days at the close of the meeting   President J. Smith gave out an appointmen for 
 the Rev Mr DeWolf an Episcopal Minister   in the afternoon.

 June 16, 1843 ~ Friday      16th I went onto the Prairie & Planted   corn & had some conversation with   Br Chena concerning his dog that bit me   I informed him that I should not be satisfyd  unless he would kill his dog as he was   dangerous & had bitten several persons      June 17, 1843 ~ Saturday      17th I spent the day diging my well      June 18, 1843 ~ Sunday      18th Sunday I attended meeting at the   Temple Elder P Magin Preached in   the fore part of the day much to our   edifycation, the Sacrament was administered   in the afternoon      During the evening some   letters were received from Judge Adams   of Springfield informing us that the   Govornor of Missouri had made another   demand for Joseph Smith at the hands   of the Govornor of Illinois & that   Govornor Ford of Illinois had issued the   writ for his apprehension it was on   the old Missouri Persecution & in fine it   is all persecution. Two messengers   were immediately dispatched to inform   President Joseph Smith of the above facts   he was absent about 200 miles from home   When will Missouri cease her ungodly   persecutions against President Joseph Smith   & the Saints O Lord hasten the day when   the blood of Saints shall not cry from the   ground in vain & when the Prophets of   God shall not have to flee from the ha[n]d v I   of the wicked persecutor & oppresser     
 June 19, 1843 ~ Monday      19 I finished digging my well got about   4 feet of water in the rock & course gravel      Theire was a meeting held by a company   calling themselves labourers saying they   were oppressed & manifested some spirit   of mob & disrule & did not act in wisdom      June 20, 1843 ~ Tuesday      20th I finished stoning my well it being   about 25 feet deep. Their was also another   meeting of the labourers      June 21, 1843 ~ Wednesday to June 24, 1843 ~ Saturday      21, 22, 23 & 24 I spent getting materials   for my house & in the printing office &   writing &c      June 25, 1843 ~ Sunday      25 June Sunday I attended meeting at   10 clock in the morning & Brother Lyman   wight (who had Just returned from a   mission in the east) arose & addressed the   meeting at full length from the 13 ch of   1st Corinth dwelt largely upon Charity show-  ing what Charity was that it was far greater   than faith & hope. He took grounds to   prove that Charity consisted in doing that   for others which they could not do for them-  selves for instance Jesus Christ died to   Redeem the world, the world could not   Redeem itself this is Charity, if our   fore fathers & Mothers & kindred have died   without the gospel, & we embrace the   gospel in our day & generation & can redeem   our relatives By being Baptized for them   they being dead that they may have part   in the first resurrection, should we do this   it would be Charity for we should do for 
 them what they could not do for themselvs   & this was wherein The Apostle said why then   are ye baptized for the dead if the dead   rise not, this is far greater than faith &   hope for though we might Believe ^& hope^ our friend   might be redeemed yet if we was not   Baptized for them they might remain in   Hell & our faith & hope do them no good   but to do that for another which he can   do for himself is not Charity. Elder Wight   made many other vary useful remarks   in his discourse  In the afternoon Elder Magin addressed   the meeting. But in the midst of his discours   President Hiram Smith came onto the Stand   & requested the Masonic fraternity to   meet him at the Lodge Room in 30   minutes we immediately went down   & a quarter could not Get into the Rooms   we then formed a hollow square on   the green. President Smith then infor  med us that the Sheriff of Jackson   Co Missouri & Wilson of Carthage had   come upon President Joseph Smith & taken   him on surprise presented each of them   a pistol to his breast & swore they would   kill him if he made any resistance. Br   Markham went to his assistance & they   presented their pistols to him also & threaten   his life but he approached them to knock   them down they again pointed their   pistols to Joseph Breast & said they would   kill him if Markham approached them     
 & to save the life of Joseph he stoped  they then took Joseph into a carrage   & started for Missouri they got about   10 miles & they were stoped by the inhab-  itants who swore they should nok [not]  carry Joseph Smith any further without   giving him the chance of law & the writ   of Habeas Corpus & they took out a writ   against the Sherriff Reynolds & wilson   of Carthage &c. & they now wanted to   get a company to go to Joseph to see that   He had his rights & Br Hyram called for   volunteers & their was two or three hundred   came out to go, the whole city flocked together   they made a choice of such as they   wished, General Laws & Rich went with   a company of Near 100 men on horsback   and about 75 or 100 on board of the Maid   of Iowa, the horsmen went by Land the   those on the Boat went down the River to   the mouth of the Illinois & up that River   to Peoria the horse company left the city   abot 8 oclok in the evening & the boat untill   next morning [FIGURE]      June 26, 1843 ~ Monday      26 Their was several Natives of the   Potawatemys through Nauvoo called to   see the Nauvoo House & Temple wanted   to talk had no interpeter that could inte-  rpet much they spoke about their great   father great spirit &c they manifested   a desire to see the Temple & the city said   they were hungry I took them home & fed   them gave them some trinklets &c     
 I had no sooner gone below than I was envel-  oped in a stench the most Horrid of any   thing I ever experianced it arose from the   cargo which consisted of goano A kind of   dung dug out of the earth brought to this country   to put on to land it is supposed to have origionally   been birds dung but the worst die pot I ever   saw was plesant in comparrison to this stench. I   lay down but my stomach was immediately   so filled with the stench that it made me as   sick as Death I immediately commenced vomiting   which continued for five hours at times. I   gag[g]ed upon an empty stomach untill I strained   myself to such a degree that blood run out of my   nose almost a stream. I suffered much through   the night & the sailors smoked their pipes  & filled the hole with tobaco smoke though   this was nacious to me it was much better   than the stink that arose from the cargo,   And in addition to this the seas were breaking   fore & aft over the boat & the boat pitching   badly this with breathing the sent of the paint   goano & tobaco smoke made me vomit to   that degree that my sufferings were great   & I thought it the most horrid night I ever spent  on the water.

Portions of   the Church was the old ancient building itself   while the remander had been repaired. we also   visited the Carlisle Castle, which was interesting   & gave us a fair view of the surrounding coun-  try. Among other things we visited the valuable   Painting at Mr Charles Thurnum Stationers   shop executed by Edward Rancier which presents   A Blacksmith in the act of shoeing a bay horse   with a Donkey by his side and dog sitting upon   the floor with his tool box Anvil tools &c scatter   about it is considered the best painting known   in existance, it so near resembals life that  one could hardly believe it to be painting—  £5000, five thousand pounds have freequenly   been offered for it & refused, it could scarcely   be bought for money they sell the engravings   for £5 pounds each it is supposed that   no artist living could draw such a painting   except Rancier. I returned to Br Bells & spent  some time in writing.       In the evening I met in council with the officers   & some of the other members in a dirty weavers   shop I addressed them for about an hour & had   a good time.

 office of an Elder which was carried, when   I closed the case of Br Albon was again brought   up for a settlement. After some remarks from  Br Davis Elder Albon got up with a heart full  of evil envy & accusation Acknowledge that what   was brought against him was true & he should   continue on his course preaching baptizing &   ordaining his own way. A vote was taken and he  was cut off from the church once more making   the second time he has been cut of from the   church. when this was done an evil spirit arose  in the hearts of some of the Priests upon another   subject which I was oblieged to reprove & put   down though it had a tendency to do good in   the end & purge evil out of the hearts of men  our meeting held untill near midnight it was   rather of a stormy meeting taking it all together   ditance of the day 15 mile  on my return home I recived a letter from   Mrs Woodruff       June 20, 1845 ~ Friday      20 [FIGURES] I recieved a letter to day from Br   Ward containing the first No of the 6th vol of  the Star.

As the city had been placarded   during the week saying that W Woodruff   would preach a funeral sermon upon the death  of the Prophet & Patriarch Joseph & Hiram Smith   who were murdered for their religion in Carthage  Illinois on the 27th of June 1844. services to   commence at ^1/2 past^ 6 oclock in the evening at an early  hour the people began to gather, And the house  was soon filled with a large respectable congregation  I took for my text the XVI ch Rev 3 to 7 verses I treated   upon the life and character of Those men the origen   rise & Progress of the church the administering of   the angel of God unto them their Persecution &   marterdom the spirit of God rested upon me and  I deeply felt the wait of the subject the house  was almost as still as the house of Death the strictest   attention was paid And a good impression seemed  to be made upon the minds of the people At the  close of the meeting a collection was taken up &   about £1.10 was taken in all. At the close of   the meeting I felt satisfied with the labours   of the day & felt thankful for the privilege   of bearing my testimony before about three hundred   Saints And many respectable citizens in the city

Smith & we  walked the streets of London for about 30 Days  before we baptized a soul and after about six months  labour we established a branch of about 40 members   & the work from that time untill the Present had   slowly progressed through all difficulty untill the   light was growing brighter & brighter & a prospect   of many souls being brought unto the kingdom of God      June 23, 1845 ~ Monday      23 [FIGURES] I recieved 2 letters one from Mrs   Woodruff & one from R.

Madame Tassaud And Sons have the the   gratfication to possess the coronation robes of   George the Fourth and the Emperor Napoleons   a most extraordinary sight to be under one roof   with an endless variety of relics of evry descrip-  tion which would fatigue the reader to ennum-  erate        I have never in my travels seen any thing that   could begin to compare with the exhibition above   spoken of I purchased on entering a Book giving   a description of the contents of each room, the   cost of fitting up this exhibition must amounted   to Millions of Dollars, in this exhibtion could be   seen the exact appearance of the crowning of   the Queen of England & her courts at various   times & the Kings & Queens of England for centuries

 May 1834      Again took up our march towards  Zion we continued to travel untill  we had arived within a few miles of  Liberty Clay County Missouri here we  pitched our tents and remained quite  a number of days on account of the  great excitement which prevailed in  consequence of false reports which were  abroad in the land respecting us. The ma  jority of the people or public opinion were  against us and even their were about  seventy men mounted on horseback  with firearms gathered together for the  intention of comeing against our  camp but the God of Israel frustr  ated their design for while they were  comeing against us the Lord rained  upon them rain and great hail so  that it was expedient for them to seek  shelter from the storm and after the stor  m they dispersed and would not go  against the camp. After remaining  stationary for several days the leading  men of Clay County and some principle     
 May 1834      Men of other Counties called at our  camp to enquire into our motives  and after a fair investigation of the  subject they manifested to us that  they were satisfied that we had no evil  designs or intentions in our move  ments or procedings. We remained in  this situation visited daily by both friend  and foes untill the High Priests held a  council and there was a Revelation given  concerning us. By this time the excite  ment had in a great measure  ceased and the Lord had granted us  favour in the eyes of the people. We  now again prepared ourselves to mo  ve forward we traveled till within about  two miles of Liberty then we again  pitched our tents near by the house of  Brother Burqett's here we remained  for several days. and while here I  witnessed a solemn scene previous  to this time while on our journey there  were disobedience and murmurings  in the camp And Brother Joseph prophesied       
 May 1834      That in consequence of these things  there was a scourge awaited the Camp  And as it was prophesied of so it was  fulfilled for soon after we had cam  ped by Brother Burkjetts we were  visited by the destroying angel and 8  or 10 of our brethren were immediately  lade helpless beneath the stroke[.] I assisted  in taking care of them through the day  and the night following and through  the night and in the morning there  continued to be new attacks. And   in the morning Joseph remarked  that it was the duty of the Camp to brake  up and disperse and take up their abode  around among the brethren lest the Sco  urge should be more severe. A reser  ve was made however for ^a^ sufficient  number to tarry to take care of the  sick. Accordingly the camp dispersed.  And Brother Seth Hitchcock was one  of the number attacked with sickness  and he belonging to our tent it reque  ired another of our tent to take care of him     
 And it was inconvenient for me to  stay to take care of him in consequ  ence of having a teem [of animals] to see to. And  by request of Brother Hitchcock  Brother Seth Ingols remained to  take care of him. I left the camp grou  nd and traveled about 7 miles to Brother   Lawery's  [Printed between lines of cursive text] in Company with Elder Holmes who  spent the summer with me at Elder L Wights      house and remained with him   for several days. I soon began to  hear of the deaths of my Brethren which  I left sick they all died which were  first taken and numbers which were  afterwards attacked there were about 20  in the whole which died at or about that  time. Brother ^Seth^ Hitchcock and Seth ^Warren^ Ingols  were among the number. Brother Ingols  had been in company with me from  the time I left my brothers Azmon  at Richland N.Y. After remaini  ng several days at brother Lawrey's  Brother Lyman Wight gave me an  invitation to spend the season with him  accordingly I made it my home at  his house and ingaged to labour with 
 July 1st 1834  with him through the season as he  had taken a job to make one hundred  thousand of brick and to build a dw  elling house out of the same for Mr  Michael Arthur, which made  labour for many of the brethren  I commenced labouring at Brother  Wight's about the first of July I  found many great and glorious privil  eges here as it was the place appointed  for the meeting of the high Council &  also the Elders Council and Courts to tra  nsact all their business. This high Coun  cil of high Priests was esstablished accor  ding to the will of God by his Joseph  Servent Joseph about the first ^organized the High Council on the 3d^[Cancellation and insertion in red ink.] of July  1834. before his return to the east. And  it is a great benefit to the inquireing  mind to be privileged of attending these  counsels as it is the privilege of the Cou  ncil to recieve the word of the Lord con  cerning all subjects that are brought  before them to be decided or investigated  that immediately concern the church     
 On points of the gospel. And in  fine those councils which God hath app  ointed in these last days are in the first  degree the most instructive and inter  esting to the honest enquirer after truth  light and intelligence that this generation  of the human family hath access to.      I continued to labour with  a number of my Brethren at Brother Wight's  through the summer and fall. We had  preaching occasionally through the summer  from persons who were appointed by the  council to teach. And seperate from those  meetings the branch of the Church by Brother  Lyman Wight's met together at his  house on the Sabbath for the purpose of  breaking bread and exhorting one another  It was a practice for any who was to be  ordained to the ministry to have the voice  of the branch of the Church in which they  were living before they were recommended  to the high Council for ordination.  It was at one of these meetings that      I wrote 12 Letters While holding the Office of A Teacher     
 November 5th 1834      Brother Lyman Wight called a vote  to recommend Brother Stephen Winch  ester, Heman T Hide and myself to the  high council for ordination it was a  full vote and at the next meeting of the  high council we were recommended  by Lyman Wight, Amasa Lyman  Elias Higby and Zebedee Colton all  high priests to the council and there was  a vote taken and carried by the high  council to ordain us priests. And  Brother Simeon Carter was appointed  to ordain us and we were ordained on  the 5th day of November 1834.      [Written in red ink and upside down] On the 3rd day of July I attended the Meetig  at Lyman Wights at which time Joseph Smith  the Prophet organized the High Council Joseph  was clothed with the power of God He  chastised David Whitmore & others for  unfaithfolnes, said their hearts were  not set upon the building up the Kingdom  of God as they should be. after He was  chastised He was set apart unde[r] the  hands of Joseph to Preside over the Land  of Zion. And Wm W Phelps & John Whitmer  Assistant Presidents or Councillor

The stars from England   as well as the letters informed me of the rapid progress   of the work of God, the fulness of the everlasting gospel  increase to the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints   but this in the midst of the most unparalleled opposition

Sarah Elizabeth was   taken wors & began to sink vary fast, they gave   her medicine but she was much distressed &   they thought mortification had taken place     
 November 14, 1844 ~ Thursday      Nov 14th Thursday [FIGURE] when the destroyer reigns darkness prevails  At about daylight I was called upon to go to Sister Foss's   for Sarah Elizabeth was dying. Mrs Woodruff and   myself went up as soon as could, & when we   arived at the house we found Sarah Elizabeth   apparently dying and appeared as though she would   not live 10 minutes. Sister Foss & Ira Foss her oldest   son was vary sick. the family was taking medicine   after the Thompsonian system viz roots & herbs three  doctors were attending upon the family, it was difficult   to tell what the fever was that they had,   it was first called the Typhus fever, but it proved   to be vary malignant if not a putrid fever, the doctors   nurses, & watchers, were nearly all more or less affe[c]ted   with it that were in the midst of it. the tongue would   turn black & in a low stage would swell. it seemed   to be a difficult matter to break up the fever after   it once seated. but to returne to the subject of Eliza-  beth, Doctor Churchell came from Saco, to see   Elizabeth, when he saw her he said it was of no use   to give her any thing for she would soon go. he gave   some council concerning the rest of the sick, & thought   preperations had better be made for removing   the corps as soon as the bre^a^th left the body & not   have it remain in the room with the rest of   the sick. and after standing by Sarah Elizabeth   Foss for two hours to see the last breath leave the   body, expecting evry moment would be the last as   she breathed shorter and shorter her puls all   of a treamor, spots appeared on the surface like   mortification her eyes were closed, her tongue black   as a coal & swollen some out of her mouth. I spent   an hour preparing a place to lay her out moving beds   bedsteads &c. when all of a sudden things took a  turn with her she opened her eyes, had her reason     
 well could talk her puls became regular, we ceased   all further preperations for laying her out. A slight   emetic was given her, ^&^ ◊injections with a portions of   charcoal, to kill mortification. her body was washed   all over will [with] Alkilie of salaratus she vomited black   stuff that looked like mortification or that it cone [come]  from the liver she appeared better through the   day. Doctors Churchel & George Sewell were both   asstonished at her being alive on their return they   continued to do what they could for her. She said she   thought she should get well. but was willing to die and   go to rest if it was the will of God. Sister Foss was   vary calm but sick felt resigned concerning   Elizabeth. & vary calmly gave the children some   council concerning domestic affairs if she should   not live, herself, in the evening Mrs Woodruff & myself   returned to Fathers Carters & spent the night  during the night Sarah Elizabeth had an immens   quantity of black matter come from her which   had the appearance of the affect of Mortification.   it appeared difficult to decide whether her revival   was a revival before death or whether it was a turn   of the fever some believed she would get well   while others believed she could not but time will soon decide  I dreamed of being in  Nauvoo Br Kimball {going to} England Br Wedster  {denied the faith} my sister Eunice {left in the hands} of Elder Young      November 15, 1844 ~ Friday      15th Sarah Elizabeth is alive this morning. Mrs Woodruff   has gone up to spend the day with the sick. Sister   Foss & Ira are also vary sick. It is a dark time I   am surrounded with darkness like midnight the   plague or the destroyer is on my right and left hand   triying to hedge up my way from filling my mission   but I trust the Lord will deliver me in some   way

I thought I could not live without   her esspecially in the Absence of my companion.   but she has gone the Lord hath taken her home to himself   for some wise purpose. It is a trial to me, but the Lord   hath stood by me in a wonderful manner I can see & feel   & that he has taken her home & will take better care of   her than I possibly could for a little while untill I shall   go & meet her yes Willford we have one little Angel in   heaven & I think it likely her spirit has visited you before   this time. It is hard living without her she used to call   her poor Pa-Pa & putty pa-pa many times in a day she left a   kiss for her pa-pa with me just before she died. She eat   her dinner as well as usual thursday was taken about 4 oclok   with a prestness for bre^a^th the Elders lade hands upon her   & anointed her a number of times, but the next day her   spirit took its flight from this to another world with-  out a groan. To day Willford & I with quite a number   of friends accompaning us came over to Commerce to pay   our last respects to our little darling in seeing her decently buried   she had no relative to follow her to the grave or to shed a   tear for her but her Ma & little Willford [FIGURES] I have just been to   take a pleasing melancholy walk to Sarah's grave, she lies alone   in peace.

Still we   have to pay high for all we eat, drink, sleep, room,   fire, candles, & a room to warn the people in &c.   & we are out of money but still we feel to put   our trust in God.

 November 28, 1840 ~ Saturday      28th this is a gloomy day in London esspecially   to me, for the whole city is envelop'd in one of   the most dreary November fogs, which makes   the air so dark & heavy that a person can scc-  arcely See a rod in the streets at mid day.   I again had an interview with Josiah W Walker   88 Church Street, Mile end New town White Chapel   & he clearly manifested his true character   & the Spirit he was of. I lent him the Book of   Mormon & he has read it several days watching   for iniquity. He informed me he should publish   against it. I told him if he wished to do so to go   ahead as soon as he pleased. I found his argu-  ments against it were weak which hath been the   case with all men that have attacked it. I walked   out to see some of my friends in the afternoon   & I found the fog to be cold & chilly. I felt lones-  om in the evening.

It brought   much knews of interest. I also received 2 lett[ers]   from P. P. Pratt. H. C. Kimball. Received a letter   from his wife Also written about the same   time, which was also interesting Brother Young   received 2 one from J Taylor & A Cordon    A Visit to the Tower of LONDON    I visited the Tower of London on the 3rd of Dec   in company with Elders B. Young & H. C. Kimball   The following are short extracts from the History of   the TOWER OF LONDON    The Tower is situated on the east side of the   city, about eight hundred yayrds from London   bridge near the bank of the River Thames. This imp-  ressive edifice, at first consisted of no more than   what at present is called the white Tower, and with-  out any authority, has been reported to have been   built by JULIUS CÆSAR, though there is the strongest  evidence of its being marked out, and a part of it first   erected by William the Conqueror, in the year  -   - 1078 [FIGURES] It contains three Batteries, the first is  called the Devils Battery, second Stone Battery third   Wooden Battery mounted with Cann. [FIGURES]  The Tower was a Palace during five hundred   years, and ownly ceased to be so on the accession   of Queen Elizabeth. Here observes Mr Penant,  "fell the meek usurper Henry VI by the dagger   of the Profligate Gloucester. Here full of horrors   died by the hands of hired ruffians, the unsteady   Clarance. who can read without Shuddering   his dreadful dream, which Shakespear makes   him relate to the Lieutenant's (Richard III. Act 1.   Scene 4th.). And here the sweet innocents Edward   VI and his brother the Duke of York fell victi-  ms to the violent ambition of there remoseless   uncle." The Principal buildings are   the church, the white Tower, Governors House   the Bloody Tower, the Offices of Ordnance   of the keepers of the Records, the Jewel Office   the Hors Armoury, Queen Elizabeth's Armoury 
 the grand Store House in which is the Small   Arm Armoury, the train of Artillery, and the   tent room; the New Store House, wharein are   three Store Roomns's. Houses for the chief and infer-  ior Officers. the Mess House for the Officers of   the Garrison, and the Barracks, for the Soldiers. In   addition to those there is a street called the Mint   which includes nearly one third part of the Tower.   The principal part of the houses were formerly in-  habited by the Officers employed in the coinage, but now   principally by the Military, Government having erect-  ed a vary extensive and majestic structure to the north   of Little Tower Hill, for the business of the Mint   department, with houses for those officers    The Grand Storehouse is north   of the white Tower, a fine building of brick and hewn   stones; it extends in length 345 feet, and is 60 feet   broad, it was commenced by James II and finished   by William III. On the first floor of this edifice   is that magnifficent room called the Small Armoury,   in which he, with Queen Mary his Consort, dined in   great state haveing all the warrent workmen and   labourers to attend them, dressed in white gloves &   aprons. THE HORSE ARMOURY.  Here in one spacious room, 150 feet by 33 are   arranged in regular and chronological order, no less   a number than twenty two equestrian figures,   comprising many of the most celebrated kings of   England accompanied by their favorite Lords   and men of rank, all of them, together with their   horses in the armour of the respective periods when   they flourished, many, indeed, in the identical suits   in which they appeared while living. Along the   centre of the ceiling immediately over each figure   is a gothic arch in the centre of which is suspended   a banner which in gold letters on both sides, expres-  ses the name, rank, and date of existence of the   personage represented. The horses stand, mounted   by their riders, almost without any visible supp-  ort on a floor of brick raised a little from the adj-  oining doarded flooring which is appropriated to the   spectators. 1. EDWARD. I. King of   England AD 1272. The armour of this figure consists   of the hawberk and its sleeves of mail, the hood & chau-  sses of the same material. [FIGURE] This monarch is represent-  ed in the act of sheathing his sword. 2 Henry VI.   King of England AD. 1450. This Plate armour is of the 
 most beautiful form, particularly the back   plate, which, like that of the breast is mad[e]   of Several pieces to be flexible. [FIGURES] the   Saddle of bone work is particular curious    3. Edward IV. King of England   AD. 1465. This is a complete suit of tournament   armour, finished with the additional p◊i◊ces termed   grand guard, volant-piece and gard-de-tras, [FIGURES]    4.th Henry VII. King of England   AD. 1508. This is a fluted suit of elegant form   probably of German manufacture    5. Henry VIII. King of England AD.   1520. This monarch appears in a suit of plate armour   gilt. [FIGURE] It is impossible to give a just summary of this   prince's qualities, he was so different from himse-  lf in the several periods of his life. [FIGURE] In his youth   he was sincere, open, gallant, and liberal; in his more   advanced years, he became rapacious, arbitrary,   violent, superstitious, obstinate, unjust and cruel. He   had six wives. After he had been married 20 years   to the first, he grew weary of her, and from a pretended   scruple of conscience, put her away. His second   wife, the incomparable Queen Ann Boleyn, mother   of Queen Elizabeth, he beheaded upon slight   ground of jealousy. He was weary of the third as   soon as soon as he was married to her. The immature   death of the fourth, perhaps prevented an untimely one.   The fifth was beheaded as her predecessor Queen Anne  was, though less innocent than Queen Ann of the   crime for which she suffered. The Sixth Queen   Catherine parr was a most religious lady, and was   so able a christian, that she had nearly disputed   her head off. Had the King lived a little longer he   would probably have made a new choice. But   he died Janury 28th1547, after a reign 37 years   and 9 months, and in the 56th years of his age    6. Charles Brandon. Duke of Suffolk   1520. He also Is represented in plate armour.    7. Edward Clinton Earl of Lincoln   AD 1535. This noblemans armour is vary elegantly   gilt. and his right hand rests on a mace. He w^e^ars a long   fluted sword. 8. Edward VI. King of England   AD 1552. This figure is particularly desierving of notice   both on a[c]count of its armour, which is what was   termed russet and gilt in the most curious manner   throughout & also for the fine Attitude in which   it is placed.

 Jan 21st Sunday [FIGURE]   A large assembly of Saints met at the Temple   and herd an interesting discours delivered   by President Joseph Smith. The following is  a synopsis of his discourse upon the occasion      When I consider the surrounding circumstances   in which I am placed in this day, standing in the   open air with week lungs & sumwhat out of   health, I feel that I must have prayers & faith   of my brethren that God may strengthen me  & pour out his special blessings upon me if you   get much from me this day. Their are   many people assembled here to day & throughout   this city, & from various parts of the world   who say that they have recieved to a certainty  a portion of knowledge from God by revelation  in the way that he has ordained & pointed out  I shall take the broad ground then that if   we have or can receive a portion of knowledge  from God by immediate revelation by the   same source we can receive all knowledge.   What shall I talk about today[?] I know what Br   Cahoon wants me to speak about, he wants me   to speak about the comeing of Elijah in the last   days I can see it in his eye. I will speak upon   that subject then. The Bible says "I will send   you Elijah before the great & dredful day of the   Lord come that he shall turn the hearts of the   fathers to the children & the hearts of the children   to their fathers lest I come & smite the whole   earth with a curse." Now the word turn here   should be translated -[bind or seal]- But what is   the object of this important mission or how is it to be   fulfilled.

O God, thy will be done.}     
 past and gone and at times it seemed as though all earth & hell were combined to crush her troubled soul  I began to cry unto God that she might be supported under these & all other trials. & I soon found that the same  spirit which had inspired her to imbrace the fullness of the gospel & forsake her friends & go a journey of 1000  miles to enjoy the society of the saints & had united her heart & hand with my own & caused her to accom-  pany me to the Islands of the sea, was with HER STILL. Yes PHEBE possesses to much firmness, & faith in God  & confidence in God to put her hand to the plough & look back or to wholey give way to such trials & any other howev[er]  great. She is determined, like Ruth, to forsake her kindred & country for Christ's sake & my own & the cause  in which she is ingaged, & as I behold this principle beaming in her daily walk, heart & countenance it binds my  whole soul to her in love stronger than death or the bars of a castle, yes that love that none partakes of except  those in like circumstances, and that man that will not love his wife with all his heart after she has made such a  sacrifice for his sake is not worthy of a companion or a standing in human society. And O ye ungodly gentiles  that would laugh at a man for considering such a wife the greatest temporal blessing that heaven could bestow  ye are more fit for the society of Demons than a virtuous woman. The devel has never tempted  me to scease from doing the will of God by gathering to Zion or to scease travling & preaching the gospel, by prese  nting before my my friends & telling me to stay & enjoy their society for in doing thus I might ruing both myself  & friends I would sooner say to him get the[e] behind me satan for I would go to the land of Zion or where ever  God sent if I had to forsake as many fathers, mothers, brothers & sisters as could stand between Maine &  Missouri & subsist upon boiled herbs on the way. Father & Mother Carter with all the Brothers  and sisters appertaining to the household, have been uncommonly attentive, kind, & generous to us both during  the last year that we have been with them, although they do not see the propriety of our gathering with the  Saints to Zion in order to escape the judgments of God, yet my prayer to God is that they may not loose their  reward for their uncommon kindness towards us but may yet have their eyes open to understand the  commandments of God concerning Zion in the last days & flee unto it for reffuge themselves & obtain a  righteous inheritance there while the judgments of God are resting upon the gentiles & may they also have  part in the first resurrection & finally obtain a celestial glory which is my prayer through JESUS CHRIST     
 September 12, 1838 ~ Wednesday      Sept 12th I spent the day at father Carters in packing up the last remains of our goods I carried  the most of our goods to Sister Sarah Foss's whare the saints or camp will spend the night when  they arive. Icabod C. Foss was expecting to go to Zion with us he is a son of sister Sarah Foss but  old Mr Foss opposed him to such a degree that it was thought best for him to tarry.      September 13, 1838 ~ Thursday      13 We have had a hard rain during the day. Besides many favorers bestowed upon us from father   Carter he gave Phebe one hundred dollars for which sum we both signed an article or writing  that we were satisfied & would hold no further claim to any of his real estate or personal property      September 14, 1838 ~ Friday      14th I accompanied Father Carter & Brother Fabyan, with Abial Carter & Timothy Roth & some others in a  fish boat out into the bay for a fishing tour. the morning was pleasent after the storm but a high  sea we dug a quantity of clams for bait & launched forth into the deep, after beating two miles  we hove to, cast anchor & caught a small quantity of fish mostly Haddock's we then sailed to a  point of Land & built up a fire hung on a pot, fried out some pork & dressed 6 Haddock & one Hake  & put them into the pot we sliced in some popatoes & put in a quantity of crackers & by adding some  seasoning & boiling it untill it was thoroughly cooked it formed as rich a dish as would be necessary  to set before a King, this kind of a dish is what seaman or fisherman call a chouder we all sat  down & ate uncommonly hearty, useing clam shells for knives, forks, & spoons, after finishing our feast  we again went out about a mile from shore & spent several hours more in fishing, we caught a  great variety of fish such as Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Mackerel, Cunner, Flounders, Sculpin, pout,  & Skate, &c. We hoisted sail & started for home about the siting of the sun we arived at father  Carters about 8 oclock PM & spent the night. Our babe passed a sick night with the Hooping cough. 20 m      September 15, 1838 ~ Saturday      15 My mind is in some suspens because the camp does not arive from the Islands neither do I hear any thin[g]  from them by letter the time has past for them to have arived however I am looking for them daily  I spent part of the day in writing while most of the household have gone to the beach for a mornings  ride. I have this morning receieved the returns of the late Election throughout the state of Maine. Mr Fairfield the  democratic candidate is elected Governor over Mr Kent by about 4000 majority     
 September 16, 1838 ~ Sunday      Sept 16 Sunday I rode in company with Brother Fabyan Carter to Buxton & spent the day with Elder Towns  -end we returned to Scarborough I spent the night at Sister Sarah Foss's distance of the day 20 miles      September 17, 1838 ~ Monday      17 I spent the day at Father Carters reading the life of Lorenzo Dow      September 18, 1838 ~ Tuesday      18 [FIGURE] I receieved a letter from Brother Nathaniel Thomas dated Sept 12 they had not yet started they  had been delayed in waiting for some that were not ready [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Brother Thomas  I also wrote a letter to [FIGURE] Elder Milton Holmes I spent the night at father Carters. WE have a  total eclipse of the sun this day commencing about 3 oclock PM & visible      September 19, 1838 ~ Wednesday to September 20, 1838 ~ Thursday      19 Spent the day at Father Carters. Also the 20      September 21, 1838 ~ Friday      21 [FIGURE] I receieved a letter from Priest Thomas he informed me the camp would be ready to start  in few days. he wished me to pray to God to deliver them & enable them to go out of Babylon. Truly  we all need patience & faith in God. for it is a day of temptation, trials, & trouble for the devil is exced-  ing mad because the saints are beginning to gather out from the midst of the gentiles & go unto the land  of Zion. I wrode to Buxton to see Elder James Townsend to get him to go to the land of Zion with us  & after having an interview with him he concluded to go with us I called upon Mr William Harman  & bargined for a two horse waggon on conditions. I returned & spent the night at father Carters {Distance} 20 m      September 22, 1838 ~ Saturday      22 The sun is crossing the line about these days. we are visited with a storm of rain to day the weather is warm  I am still at father Carters & much desirous to see the Camp of the Saints. Our babe is recovering from  the Hooping cough, may its life be preserved I Pray if it is the will of the Lord      September 23, 1838 ~ Sunday      23 Sunday I spent the day at Father Carters      September 24, 1838 ~ Monday      24 I saw a report in the Portland Transcrip against the Mormons -[Saints]- in Davis County Mo  which arose on the day of the election in consequence of our Brethren enjoying their privilege  as American Citizens by casting their vote & that numbers were rising up among the gentiles of  the different Counties to go over to Davis County to mob the Saints all these reports & stories  have a tendency to dampen & discourage the minds & feelings of many [of] the saints that are gatheri  -ng to Zion. But none of these things moove me I am determined to overcome, keep the faith & go to Zion     
 September 25, 1838 ~ Tuesday      Sept 25. O Lord give me faith, grace, & patience to endure what is lade upon ^me^ without murmering or  complaining, help me to be resigned to thy will in all things. The report that I spoke of yesterday concerning  the Mormon's in Mo as the saints are called, is going the rounds today among our friends & neighbo  -urs; this one is saying it wont do to go & that is saying it will not do to go for you will be killed  &c. But O, fools, slow at heart to believe that God is as able to protect his saints in these  last days from the hands of the gentiles as HE was anciently to deliver Israel from the Egyptians  Those things are the smallest part of my trials & suspens that is resting upon my mind at this  time. My trials are as great about these days as at any time since I have been a member of the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. If any inquires what my trials are, should they ask if I was  doubting the cause in which I am ingaged, I can answer in truth NO, God forbid[.] I never was a stronger  Mormon Saint than about these days. What is the matter then, I'll" tell you: The Lord has commanded  me to go to Zion spedily & while I am setting myself myself about it the devel with all his agents are  using their combined exertions & power to hinder me. I have been waiting for the saints from the  Islands of the sea to accompany them to that land untill it is vary late, the fall rains are upon us, cold  weather will soon encircle us, the minds of the saints are depressed & cast down around me, we have  a dreary journey of two thousands miles before us with no other expectation but to camp upon the ground  I have a sick infant of two month's old to take with us & a wife whose spirits at times are much  depressed under such [illegible] ^severe^ trials But thank God she stands the shock like a brave soldier which  is great consolation to my soul. The above are some of the trials that are resting upon me. But I  can say get the[e] behind me Satan for I say in the name of Jesus Christ that I will stand in the land  whare God has commanded me to gather unto before another spring rolls over my head if it is on  foot & alone & I beg my bread by the way. So now rage on thou foul monster untill thou art stoped  in thy mad career at the end of thy chain given thee by the angel of God & see who will gain the  victory. I spent the day at father Carters gathering apples I saved some apple seeds from his  orcherd to plant in Zion     
 September 26, 1838 ~ Wednesday      Sept 26th I rode to Elder James Townsend. I procured a two horse waggon of Mr William Harmon {for Sister  Sarah Foss} & drew it to sister Sarah Foss's Elder Townsend returned with me distance of the day 20 m      September 27, 1838 ~ Thursday      27th It is a dark cold rainy day & gloomy also, & what makes it more so the Camp of the Saints do not get  a long from the east yet, & I have not herd any thing from them for several days. But may the Lord give me  patience that I may be resigned in all things. Notwithstanding the cold rain I harnessed up my horse & carri  ed Brother Townsend home, & assisted him in packing up his houshold goods to the amount of about 600 lbs  I took the goods in my waggon & carried them to Sister Sarah Foss's house that we might be ready when the camp  came along: Elder Townsend has been cast down in his mind for several days & could scarcely get faith enough to  prepare himself & family to start for Zion thinking the way did not look as clear & bright as he wished to see it.  But I have encouraged him from day to day; as we must walk by faith not by sight, untill he is now preparing him  -self & family to go, may the Lord bless him. We must all have our faith tried before we are prepared for a celestial  kingdom & "faith without works is dead being alone." I do not know when my faith will begin to be tried if it has  not already been esspecially of late, But I thank the LORD that HE has thus far enabled me to keep the faith & withs-  -tand every opposition. I desire to be humble unto the end. I spent the night at father Carters. Phebe appears resign  -ed to the will of the Lord in all her troubles & tribulations. It is great consolation to my soul to see her determined to  maintain her integrity unto the end. How good it is to have a help meet in every time of need. Distance 20 mil      September 28, 1838 ~ Friday      28th Glory to God I have this morning taken a letter out of the office from our Beloved Brother Nathaniel Thomas in Camden  the letter was [FIGURE] Dated Camden Sept 26. he says "We are almost ready we shall start tomorrow morning, tell  Brother Townsend to hold himself ready to go with us &c" May the Lord bless them & hasten them on their journey I  pray.

It was for a moment a trial to my feelings  to take my tender wife with an infant at her breast into a cold tent to sleep upon the ground but after we became  reconciled to it there was a door opened for her to go into a house to spend the night & as she had a young child she  excepted the invitation. I lay down upon the bed that I had spread in the tent & after lying two hours I got up  to stand on guard & I sat up the remainder of the night built up a fire & wrote thes lines by it Distance of the day 13 m      October 5, 1838 ~ Friday      Oct 5th We started 8 oclock & drove to Wells 8 miles to York 14, to Portsmouth 7, to Rye 5 miles & camped for the night  & at Mr John Drake we had a beautiful day to Journey.

WOODRUFF, Who DIED at Terre Haute  Indiania on the 18th of Oct 1838 at 3 oclock in the morning [FIGURES] I also read in the Wabash  Courier published at Terre Haute an account of the administrator's sale of the property of Brother ASAHEL  It was sold on the 4th of Dec for about $3000 dollars Mr Robert A Smith was his Administrator. O Brother Asahel  thou art gone I shall warn thee no more nor see thy face in the flesh untill the resurrection. How uncertain is life. How  sudden thy earthly hop[e]s have fled!!!!!! !!!!!!!! [FIGURE] I also read in the same paper an account of the horrid butchery  of eighteen Latter Day Saints in Davis county Mo by the wicked mob. O Lord hasten the day for the reign of righteousness. 31.      December 12, 1838 ~ Wednesday      12 I rode to Terrehaute Ia on the beautiful national road through the delightful scenery of that country I drove to Asahel H. Woodruff'[s] Wabash  Bookstore & instead of finding Br Asahel there he was in his grave & his store occupied by his Administrator & Clerk viz R A  Smith & Martin Ray I had an interview with his clerk Martin Ray I made Inquiries concerning Brother Asahels sickness  & Death but defered attending to his business untill the following day. It was with difficulty that we could get entertain  ment in the city for the night but finally we obtained an empty house & went into it & spent the night. Distance 27     
 [FIGURE] ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF  DIED at Terre Haute I.a.  Oct 18th 1838  AGED 24 Years    And is he gone, has asahel fled away, from lif's fair scenes to the regions of the DEAD  Yes he is gone by deaths relentless hand. Had youth, or beauty, friends or virtue, power to save  He now might be mingling with his friends, and not sleeping in the silent GRAVE    There is nothing calculated to sooner lead the mind to serious & solumn meditations &  to bring fresh to our memory the events of our past lives than to visit the tomb of  those that are made dear to us by the ties of nature, of friendship, or of the blood of CHRIST.  Brother Asahel was a young man of the most brilliant talents, firm & independant in  independant in his principles. I had not been privileged with a personal interview with him  for about seven years but had corresponded together by letter. Asahel had a peculiar art in  letter writing which gave much interest to all the productions of his pen. We both had  long anticipated much upon an interview with each other but my hopes were suddenly blasted. I  did not hear of his death untill the day previous to my arival at his dwelling. But I say the will  of the Lord be done all is right I feel resigned     
 O death thy stroke is sure. At an early hour thy  victim's fallen, & blasted the fond hopes of a father  a mother & an ownly sister. Eunice be still & know  that GOD hath spoken, & thy Brother called. Asahel  lived for thee: for thee he plan'd, he toiled, & hoped, & airy  castles built for thy future joy, but now he's gone. His  grave remains to be wattered ownly by the Dews of hea-  ven unless upon the Wabash banks a friend should chan-  ce to roam & drop an accidental tear. O Asahel among  strangers thy lot was cast among them thou hast fallen  & found a grave. No friend to see thy grief or share thy joy  or drop a tear with thee. Willford & Phebe alone marked  thy silent bed & ownly could take a pebble in memory  of thy noble soul. A pebble did I say, ah thy books, thy Journals,  thy letters, & all the productions of thy pen, are standing  monuments of thy worth & of more value to thy friends  than the gold of Opher or the rubies of Peru. In the morn  of thy days thou hast fallen yet the events of thy youth will  be active in the memory of thy friends while memory lives  Methinks the spirit steals across my breast & says be still  & learn to be resigned & feel that with thy brother all is well  that what was not accomplished with him in time, will be  finished when COLOB'S walls he stands clothed with      Immortality. God is just, all is right. In the morn of his  days Asahel is called from the scenes of time that his  noble soul may see, feel, & view those glories which are  hid behind the vale the covering of eternity. Farewell  Asahel farewell. No more will thy voice the ears of thy friends  salute or thy pen their hearts unlock, while here in time, truth  unsuled before the now are living realities, while Willford's testi-  mony to thee in its true light can now be weighed. Upon thee  nature hath bestowed her bounty but not in vain though  buried from human view, then sleep untill the trump  shall sound to call the[e] forth in eternal things to act.  Eunice dry thy startling tear & give thy brother up. The  Lord hath taken him to save his soul that earthly snares  should not his feet enwrap & his fall secure. It speaks in  language loud be ye also ready, for in such an hour as  ye think not the son of man cometh. How solumn to  part with friends yet it sweetens death to know our  friend is God & the rest of saints our home. Then sleep  Asahel sleep let naught thy dust disturd untill rean  imated by the Arkangels trump & in immortals gate  to meet thy friends & walk in paths of eternal light &  truth & comprehend all knowledge & wisdoms space  & natuers laws that ever live in vast DOMAIN     
 December 13, 1838 ~ Thursday      Dec 13th This was a solemn Day to me. I spent most of the day in inquiring into & attending to the business & affairs  of Brother ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF Deceased. Messrs R. A. Smith & Martin Ray the administrator & clerk of Brother  Asahel informed me that Brother Asahel Died at 3 oclock in the morning on the 18th of Oct 1838 & that he was  sick 10 days & deprived of his reason 4 days before his death. his mind while delireous was principly upon his business  but occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was the congestive fever on the brain Martin Ray had been in  his employ two months was with him through all his sickness & death they informed me that they considered  him some absent minded or his mind deeply exercised upon some subject unbeknown to them for several months  before his death. they were not as well acquainted with this matter as I was myself for I was intimately  corresponding with him by letter & I know from his communications that his mind was deeply interested  in the subject of the gospel of Jesus Christ or the fulness of it & the cause of the church of Latter Day  Saints. They also informed me that he was moral in his life temperat in practice Beloved & honoured as  a citizen & his loss deeply felt. His entire stock of Books with all personal property was sold at the Administrator  sale on the 4th of Dec amounting to about $3000 dollars. All of his private letters, Journals, writing, papers  account Books & his pocket watch, penknife, pencil, letter stamp, bosom pin, silver thimble, & some other small things  were reserved & I took them into my possession to preserve for his Mother & ownly Sister & friends untill I can  have an opportunity to convey them unto them. While looking over Asahels letters I found all that I sent him  carefully filed with other communications from his friends After attending to the above affairs I visited my  Brother grave [FIGURE] A.H.W. accompanied ownly by my wife & Mr Ray I viewed it, & it looked lonely indeed. I never more fully  sensed the vanity of earth & the impropriety of trusting to the honours of this world for happiness than on this occasion  I took some pebbles from his grave in memory of the spot & retired with this peculiar reflection resting upon my mind  That I had paid my last visit to my eldest Brother without spending a night beneath his roof  That I had paid my last visit to my youngest Brother & ownly permitted to view his GRAVE  I returned to his Book store & wrote a Letter to our Parents in Farmington Con [FIGURE] giving an account of Asahels  Death &c. I took the parting hand with Mr Smith & Ray & left Terre Haute & crassed the Wabash River into the state of  Illinois & travled 9 miles & put up for the night 9 miles

We travled through a 14 mile prarie & a 12 mile prairie with a snow  storm & we put up for the night at R. P.

We called in to visit them a few moments not expecting to tarry but  an hour as it were but after calling in we concluded to spend the night & during the evening I had an interview  with Elder Arnold Stephens I was informed that we could not cross the Illinois River in consequence of the  Ice. I also learned that the Saints in Zion far west were suffering the severest persecutions & privation  & we could not travel through that country & with all these combination of circumstances we concluded  to stop for a season whare we were as doors were open unto us in the regions of Rochester & that to among the Sain-  ts that had taken up there abode in the place for a season. [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to sister Eunice 2 miles      December 20, 1838 ~ Thursday      20th I spent the day in preparing a dwelling to moove into for a season as we all concluded to stop for a while. I procured a  house 3 miles north of Rochester in a grove of woods on the borders of a prairie on the farm of widow Branch to spend the winter  in it was a double house & Brother Joseph Coone is living in one part of it      December 21, 1838 ~ Friday      21 We spent the day in searching for dwellings for Brothers Brown & Luce & their families      December 31, 1838 ~ Monday      31 This is the last day of Dec & of 1838.

 This hath been a busy day with me & after   standing upon my feet from morning till night   I am called to shake hands with hundreds of   saints who possess glad hearts & cheerful   countenances. & it is with no ordinary feelings   that I meditate upon the cheering fact that   a thousand souls have been Baptized into the   New & Everlasting Covenant within half a   year in one field which God has enabled me to   open & I Pray God to Accept the gratitude of my   heart for his mercies & blessings unto me in this thing  & enable me to stand with these saints & all the   righteous in the Celestial Kingdom of God  I walked home with Brother Oaky & spent the   night. & after standing upon my feet 8 hours   in conference, conversing much of the time,   Ordaining about 30, confirming some, healing many   that were sick, shaking hands with about 400   saints, waking 2 miles, & Preaching 4 hours in   the Chimney Corner, I then lay down & dreamed   of Ketching fish  September 22, 1840 ~ Tuesday      22nd I spent the day at Br John Coles in writing  There was two dead Bodies carried by the house   whare I was sitting to the Burial to day they were   both aged & the man vary wicked he had often wished   his wife Dead & Boasted what a joyful time &   high scrape he would have when she did Die. she   Died on the 18th & he Died in few hours after   [on the] same Day. was found dead in his room with his   Door locked, the woman was 90 years of age  & the man 80 their names was James & Sarah   Love this is the fourth Day since they Died  the English custom is to keep the Dead 4 days.
