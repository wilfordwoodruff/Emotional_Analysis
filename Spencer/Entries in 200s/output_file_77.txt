It is builed Flemish band ofbrick burned bricks the strechers are red and theheaders white which with the white cut stone windowand Door caps and sills formes a beautifull frontBro Westly Willis is building this house and whenfinished as he intends to do it would be an ornamentto any city. There is but three other houses on thewhole plat one a small adobie one a log and ahole in the groundWe left Cedar City on the 16th of of Nov withbro Roundy & Williams with us making a 9 ninein all in the company their loading was Flour & OatsWe traveled to warm spring or Little Painter Creekabout twenty miles from Cedar here we camped and al-lowed the animals to run loos over night the nextmorning three of them were missing. The brethren huntedfor them three days without finding them and had cometo the conclusion that they had returned to Cedar City &bro Jones had just sent to men back to hunt forthem there when they came into camp of there ownaccord. Another man was soon dispacth to bring the othertwo ^men^ back the[y] did not return until the next evening whichmade four days that we were detained at this placeWe started on our Journey again on the 21st andpassed through Painter Creek Valley. Here Bro R. C. Allenwith some of the Indian missionaries have commencedto make a new settlement and intend to finish theFort next season The Valley is a small one and ^the land & water^ is notsufficient to sustain but a few families The range is goodand extensive. We had a heavy snow storm on us whle thefirst night we camped on the Santa Clara which lasted fortwo nights and one day. The snow was from four to eightinches deep on the divide betwen the Santa Clara and RioVergin which is an uncommon thing to be seen at any season ofthe year. At this divide we commence traveling over adesolate country which might truthfully be called the desert. We had unusual cold weather while travelingdown the Virgin and the sand being wet and sometimesfrose caused the wagons to role very heavy which made ithard on the teams and the feed being poor we were oblige^d^to let the animals run loos nights and although therewas a guard through the darkness of the night they wouldmanage to get away nearly every night and some times woul^d^be found ten miles back on the road and always as far thatway as they could get. We arrived at the Muddy on the 24nd ^of Dec^ the placethat has been represented as a good place for a settlement but for the life of me Icould not see nor immagine where they Land ether for plowing meadow orrange could be found neither wood nor timber We saw more Indians at thisplace than at any other on the road they appeared to be quite friendly We started acrossthe desert on the 3rd 1st and arrived at Los Vegas (called by some at that placeLost Baggis which is a very appropreate name for it) on the 4thWhile here I learned that there were divisions, contentions & dissatisfactionamong the brethren here and nearly every one were on the point of leaving someto the north and some to Sanbarnadino Callifornia but when bro Jonesshowed them the letters fro Prest Young which droped Prest Bringhurst fromthe presidency at this place and placing Bro Samuel Thompson in his placethere was quite a change which I hope will be for the better. There is notfarming land enough to sustain more than ten families and they would haveto farm on a small scale the range is very poor snow fell about 21inches deep here a few days before we arrived a thing never known before by theoldest inhabitants. We arrived at the Diggins on the 8th which is in a highrange of mountains about 350 miles from Los Vegas in a south west courseBro Jones immediately after our arrival commenced to make the necessary preperations tocommencing ^to^ melting out the Lead

 June 15th 1897President Wilford WoodruffBox B. Salt Lake City, UtahDear Brother!I send you today under an other cover, alithographic picture of yourself, which I by theapprobation of the leading brethren have made(being a lithographer myself and working in thattrade) as many of the saints have expressed theirdesire of having a good and lasting picture ofour venerable leader to adorne their home. I havealso hope of pecuniary interest as I long forthe day when I and family can gather with thesaints of God in the peaceful vales of Zion, andit being impossible for me to get there by the earn^ings^from my dayly labor, hence I have ventured thislittle enterprise and hereby ask for your approval.your humble brother in the gospel of Christ,Peter S.
