From fifty to sixty houses have been burnt in thes Lima branches of the church, and of course two or three hundred people thrown houseless into the naked air to perish. The French drove the Arabs into the cave and smoked them to death, but the Americans drive the saints out of their houses, burn them, and leave the inmates to famish: which exhibits the most shocking barbtyarity, in this christian age?  Last night bro Fellows, 4 miles this side of Carthage, had his house, barn, and grain burnt.  Writz are out for the "Twelve" and others upon the grave charge of Treason.  We are at peace in Nauvoo. The Temple is finishing rapidly. The steeple is outwardly finished and looks grand. ENDENTRY The Nauvoo house has arisen within three weeks nearly two stories.  We have had a good season for grain but, I some fear, unless the Sheriff and proper authorities raise force enough to disperse the mob, that much will be burnt. However, I have no reflections to make, while the devil has hiz day. The saints, if they live godly in Christ Jesuz shall suffer, as they always have, persecution.  You know we wait patiently for the "when"—Thus saith the Lord, and "then," blessed be the name of the Lord, we shall be "free indeed:" having come up through great trib- ulation.  We have not had so sickly a season as last year, though many have chills and fever lightly.  I was at Bro. Benbow's the other day: he was down with the new ague and fever but not bad. Your little ^willy^ was hearty as apig buck.  Under the management of the "Twelve" every thing has flaurished so visibly, that no one can doubt but the Lord reigns with saints in Nauvoo.

We have held a series of meetings for 13 days, generally in the evening, in Fruita and vacinity, to crowded houses, and for the last three nights, have been holding a disscussion with Dr S. P. Green a noted Infidel and gentleman of culture, a graduate of colledge, who pressed me so strongly by letter that I felt I could hardly refuse to accept his challenge, as it would appear to our many friends that we were affraid to have our principles investigated. I accordingly felt that the best things to do was to was to accept  the gentlemans challenge. I accordingly did so. The Dr is very widely known in this valley as a man of good  ENDENTRY education and ability—the news ^of the debate^ soon spread of  like wild fire a large town hall was secured and the anticipated discussion was known became christened the "Mormon Infidel Discussion." standing room was at a premium, for isf ever you saw a people stirred, as I know you have many times you can imagine how the people felt here conducted themselves here—for 10 miles around they came to our meeting: The subject of dis under discussion was: Resolved: that Mormonism was and is founded upon "Myth-history Superstition and Credulity"—the Dr took the affirmation and I the negative.  I felt much depended upon the result of the debate and made it a matter of earnest prayer ^in connection with the brethern,^ and asked our Heavenly father to give us success—for we had a great desire to make an opening ^here^  The hour arrived to open the discussion, the Dr who has a splendid Library and is a well had fortified himself with a supply of Anti Mormon literature, opened the discussion by attacking the character of Joseph Smith and rideculed the idea of angels appearing to men, and brought up the Spaulding story—the Danites, spiritual wife doctrin: the and tried to prove  that the prophet was put to death upon this ground by enraged husbands, who was seeking vengance on the defiler of their homes—he brought up affidavids by the dozen—among some of which was th contained in the "American Encyclopedia" among many other things, an affidavit from purporting to be  sworn to by Thomas B.

STEELE, ROBERT L. BYBEE, JOS. S. MULLINER,  Presidency of the Bingham Stake.  Dear Brethren:  Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to President George Q. Cannon, contains an enquiry concerning the correct language to be used in ordaining a man to the office of an Elder. You say some little difference of opinion exists among the brethren of your Stake on this point.  We do not like to write out a form of ordination for the office of an Elder. But it is a very simple ceremony, as are all the ceremonies connected with the ordinances. This is beautifully illustra- ted in the form which the Lord gives, on page 609 of the Book of Mormon, concerning the ordination of Priests and Teachers.  There are some people who seem to attach great importance to phraseology, and are very technical, and think things are not done right unless every word is spoken just as it should be. This is not right. A spirit of that kind leads to disputations as to forms; and we find considerable of that arising from time to time in theological clas- ses and among others. That which is necessary in ordaining a man is to ordain him to the office in the Aaronic Priesthood or the Melchisedek Priesthood (whichever it may be) by the authority of tyhe Holy Priesthood ENDENTRY and in the name of Jesus. This, in a few words, is all that we think necessary to be said upon the subject.  With kindest regards,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY Oct 10th 1848  J.

You may quary in your mind what has become of your property, to which I would reply—there has been 2 of your best oxen butchered and used up in the family for beef one the indians got and Old Bille is yet alive but hardly able to get up when he is down.

Our mail is closed, and about ready to start. Our General Epistle is in Type, by which you will learn General news, and we shall send this, and many more communications by Express, to overtake the mail in the mountains. Your friends are well, and the People generally, and we would all be glad to see you here with your family.  Gather up all the Saints in the East, this Winter, and make ready, and in the Spring come with them, and you will see great improvements have taken place since you left home. Tell the brethren of Capital to bring means to establish factories.  Say to the brothers Livingston, at Peterboro, that next year there will be wool enough raised in the Valley, to supply a considerable factory, that the cloth is needed here, that here is the place for building Zion, that here is a better place to manufacture and make money than any other place: and persuade one or all, and all such to remove with delay to this place. Next Season we design a settlement over the rim of the Basin on the South, where cotton, rice and sugar cane will flourish, and from whence we can get our supplies: but even at present, it would be far better to transport the raw cotton from the States and have it manufactured here, than to bring the cloth, for there are good water privileges in abundance, and experienced workmen on hand. therefore start out a company both for cotton and woollen manufacturing, this Winter ready for spring's emigration with machinery, andc, and every facility will be granted them in this place, which possible can be. ENDENTRY Also we want some Iron founders. There is coal and Iron not far distant in good locations, and moulders in the Valley, therefore do not fail to bring us a founder, for castings of all descriptions are much needed, and there is no location in the States so good as this for the business.  There is no class of mechanics or manufactures but can do  well here, for we are in the centre of Creation, and in need of many things except Gold, but should we tell you all we have seen and handled you could scarce believe.  In the short space of about one month we have received by voluntary donation over 5,500 dollars for a perpetual emigrating fund, and sent Bishop Hunter, to the States  to gather up the Poor. Further particulars you will glean from our Epistle, and our letters to brother Hyde, a copy of which you will doubtless see. You are an agent to solicit and receive donations for said fund: any means you can gather and forward to Bishop Hunter at Kanesville early in the Spring will be immediately applied, to its destined object.  Find brother New York and bring  him on with all his goods. We also want brother Jesse C. Little to settle up his affairs and come to this place. This is the place for business, for increasing and doing good.  Come with the Saints, Master Workmen, machinery, with your Gold, (not Silver 'tis too heavy) and all precious things, and when you arrive, we shall have so much to tell you what we cannot write, you will be ready to declare "a half has not been told me," Yes Bro Woodruff stretch out your arms like a man of God, and gather up and bring a host to Zion.  With our best wishes and blessings on yourself and family and all the faithful. We remain your brethren in Christ.  Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Willard Richards ENDENTRY P.S.

Brigham Young dated Nov. 25th that you with the greater part of your Quorum had returned to Winter Quarters, I resolved to Seize, (not a favorable moment for writing to you,) but rather a forced capture of some fleeting moments to fulfill my promise and delight in the matter. It cheers my heart to learn that you have become sound enough to make a visit of two thousand miles over the mountains in one season in company with so many of your beloved Quorum. All in health and increased strength I say to glory to God for this glorious and successful but arduous expedition of the Latter Day Liberators! This expedition will constitute a new epoch in the annals of the everlasting kingdom, that will be conspicuous for worlds to come for the energy enterprize and indefatigable endurance of the performance The results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthy and glorious. I shall now venture to tell the British Saints and the Nations of Europe that Zion is established That their eye may look upon her that is to be the joy of the whole earth and and an eternal excellency." Beautiful for Situation is that place. The mountains are round about the fat valley of the great basin ENDENTRY as a munition of Rocks. The splendid intelligence of  the millennial Era is requisite in order to appreciate the worth of the labors of the first founded of the kingdom of Latter day glory. I shall boldly declare that a resting place for the laboring and heavy laden of all Nations is now prepared. I can now answer the moanful cry of the emigrant that has often been reiterated in my ears in this land; "When may we emigrate? I have long been out of business and expending my means, when can I emigrate? Now I have the happiness through your toils and memorable discovery and liberal permission to announce the welcome day. I do not regret having come to England on this important mission, neither shall I regret an invitation to return when it comes from your dear and honored Quorum. The past year has been one of great prosperity as to the enlargement of the Church in this Island and the increase of faith and diligence and zeal in the work of the Lord. Many thousands have been added to the Church and peace and union have pervaded all parts of the Kingdom of Christ  on this Wales there has been added to the Church about one hundred and fifty a month for five or six months past. In nearly all places the work moves forward with the most delightful impulse. All feel strong and ardent for the increase of the Saved. What will be the effect of Emigration upon the future impulse and progress of the work is  ENDENTRY yet problematical. American Elders will become  scarce after three more leave the Island. A few recruits would not come amiss. Agreeable to my instructions from counselcil I shall open the channels of emigration with all possible diligence. The Emigrants will almost unavoidably stop at different places. Some are anxious to go, if they can reach no further than St Louis or even New Orleans and I am glad that the Council saw fit to appoint an agent to look after them at these places. I need not inform you that it will be very necessary. I have increased the number of our Paper during the year about 5 or six hundred. The present numbers now issued at the commencement of the Two first no's of the tenth volume are about 32,000 I have printed nearly 200,000 small Tracts or "Invitations" and more than 150,000 pages of larger Tracts which are spread abroad among the people aiming thereby to warn and invite all the inhabitanits of this Island as far as practicable. The Saints are almost enthusiastic in preaching and warning the people in every possible way. The new Edition of the Hymn Book is nearly all sold. A small new Edition of the Book of Mormon is also just printed. I have also just printed a Small volume mostly of Letters in continuation of a reply to Rev. Wm Crowil Boston Mass. U. S. A. which received a ready demand I have purchased a Phonatic Font of 329 pounds wright for the Council according to request, and shall ENDENTRY Send ^it^ by Bro Wheelock Soon; having no chance to Send it Sooner safely. I shall also purchase a good microscope to send at the same time. I have addressed three Letters to Pres. Young since I have been here, one of them was Superscribed to Pres. Young or Pres. Hyde. I have in the absence of Pres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld. Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposing him to be the proper authority to counsel me.  I am fully ready to return home or to remain or go elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidence of the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lord as it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres. Young when he appointed me to this mission and lately repeated and formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz not to walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in office almost inclined me to look over my geography to see in what part of the world it is that they poke one horse because another horse is unruly. My heart is  sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate and now sick little children and I could return to them with joy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with  the faith and support of all Israel and hope ever to merit the same by well doing. Crime and distress are awful in this land and the evils increase rather than disminish. The power of the endowment is mightily visible in Europe if not in America. My playful allusion to the hint to Pres. Young is, done with the utmost kindness and respect for his motives and the wisdom of the hint. Remember me in the praying circle for I never felt my need of wisdom more. Give my love to your wife and Pres Young and I want to say more but business hurries and my sheet is full.

You said nothing to me about their moveing into the other house there has been nothing done to it since you left but Emma took a starte yesterday to move in so they both have mooved Emma takes the side next Mrs. Tosses and Sarah the other.

The most of the leaves remain on the appletrees yet. My health is not veyvery good this win- ter I fearl much of the effects of my summers work. The chil- dren all go to school but Willford has had very bad eyes for 8 or 10 days so that he cannot read or study. Fathers health is uncommonly good this winter but I never knew him as fractious as he is and has been lately. Last thursday sister's Pratt, Hyde, Benson Hooper and Smith made me a visit, (sister Young being quite sick she could not come,) the most of them brought their letters and read them and we had a very pleasent time. Sister Smith's letter was read first which gave the infor- mation of Br. Pratt's addition to himself. I think there was some jokes passed and prophecyes, delivered upon the occasion, however it was ENDENTRY nothing unexpected to her as she said they had decided upon it before he went away that is if he saw any one that would answer the purpose that he wished, he then wrote her that he had found one she said that he had been trying a number of months ^to find someone.^  I soon sent to the office when I had time and received your package and distributed them according to the directions I am glad to have you write to them ^the children^ as they have often told me that you cared nothing about them but to scold them, they were much pleased with their letters I thought them very good and they all want to write you Moroni not excepted he was much pleased and wants the children to write you for him but Bula thinks she can write write and dictate herself, so she has written some. Moroni does about as well as can be expected but he requires a tight reign kept. I thought I would not say any thing about my family cares to you to distrub your felicity but you asked me to tell you how the children Sarah got along. I think the children and Emma get along very well in school Willford has not been able to study much for sometime on account of his eyes I have got him a new pair of boots and paid $3.50 cts for them. E s^t^ays with me most of the time but the children do much better without her than with her as she waits for them and they for her so the work is principally left for me also she stirs them up to make a noise and theirs is much jargon between her and Susan which frets father much she inclines to stay here all the time she makes me much more trouble than she  ENDENTRY G.

I am very glad to hear from you often  I forgot to tell you that we get but one number of the news—I thought perhaps you had one number sent to you. We are all well. The measles are about and I am afraid that Bula will get them.  We have sent a large package of letters to you by Br Haywood with which I think you will be amused and Phebe has just received one by mail in answer to one she wrote on the windowseat in the dusk  I knew nothing she wrote, she says she will do better next time. The weather for 3 days past has been very cold but today is mild. Br Haywood expected to have gone 2 day before this but he expects to start in the morn. I have just writen this to say that we have received I think all your letters  So good by my love good by  Phebe W. Woodruff  I think if you had as much confusion about you as I think you have it would be perplexing to you ENDENTRY does she thinks she thinks she does well. If the children were alone I could say to them you must and you must not but with her I must be very careful to not give  offence—she was quite offended to think that you told Sarah that her education and principles were establish she said she should tell you that it was a fine thing that one of the family was established—baulderdash has showed itself a number of times there by her but I have as yet kept my foot on it. Sarah has had a cold but has got over it and is as cross as is possible she has got a web in the loom of about 20 yds. she has been 2 weeks about it and I think if she keeps on she will get it out by spring. Miss Bula is so turbulent themat I am obliged to take a stick to her sometimes, taking all things here together I have all that I can get along with I think S. and E. will write you. I am thinking of takeing the children to the ward party ^on christmas^ to please them but myself would much rather stay at home I suppose you will have fine times with you on Christmas and New years well I hope you will enjoy yourself while you can. I feel that the cares and troubles of this life are many but time rolls rapidly and I am glad of it. Susan has teased a long time to let her ask you one question at last I gave her permission so she has dictated all herself. 25th Br. Haywood has kindly sent me word this morn that he will take letters or any small package to you I dont think of any thing save these letters and Phelps bill that you will need before you come home.

I wish you could have been here unless you was better provided for, but any way we would like to see you home. I hope you will not be sick while away as you spoke of not haveing an appetite. Last rvr the children E. and myself went to the ward party and had a very pleasant time—wish you could have been there, very many went to the Hall. I find myself very comfortably situ provided for this winter I think I should enjoy it much better if the one who provided it could partake with us but I shall try to save something against you come with your new bride, for from a dream that I had on the night of the 20th about you you had or was about to get one—then you spoke of the andc. The man that spoke to you about threshing the wheat called to do it but I told him he must wait untill you come home. My children are as kind and good to me as children could possibly be with the exception of Bula's freakes they have all taken turns with me in family prayr ever since you left Emma wanted to be excused but I told her she could not if she staid with me. The children have all dictated their own letter as you will perceive I have not read one of them yet.

Woo^d^ruff.  Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire- cted to Bishop Sidney Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely to them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it. You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.  In the past summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival, we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving Kirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so 3 illegible words ^an unbeliever in the book^ ^of Mormon, reveiled religion, illegible,^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, Luke Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, illegible ^united^ togeather in for the 2 illegible words ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and his company returned on or about the 10th of December; soon after which this 2 illegible words ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly, renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed, themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks ENDENTRY How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church, was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again, it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" andc "Again, "the Kingdom, and the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to the people, (the Saints) of the most High" andc And the Saints here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.  We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most rest of this 2 illegible words, ^combination^ have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists. Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move- ment of things here, as they are and have been.  You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with Elder Tennessee, in the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto John Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author- ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement, but because they selected the place of the City Far West and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and ordained a committee to build the same, without asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop, High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under- stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun- ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of God.  These two presidents also managed to get the town plott into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W. Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they adjourned.

I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter when I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my voyage and travels since I left New York to the present time, and then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839 in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular packet ship of the New York and Liverpool line. viz Elders Turley and myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock and moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass and set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat. She had on board 15 cabin and 64 steerage passengers and Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter and 26 sailors, making 109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind and sail well. 21st stift breeze and fair wind most all on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, and myself some sick, a high wind through the day and a high gale at night, Boat rocked and pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough and winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high and as rough as the Hills and valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, and I got vary wet, and as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, and though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose and we sailed well 26th A rough sea and strong Breeze. 27th fair winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black fish and porposes. 29th pleasant morning and high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi- culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, and trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This with the noise of the Officers, and sailors reefing and taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds and rushing waves made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing Pillows which are magestic) for one is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, and must be crouded thick together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm andc. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along rough sea, blustering, cloudy, and high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair and good breeze sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her with great speed. 4th Fair weather and wind, stiff Breeze and fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs and sheep on board. 5th rough sea, high winds, and rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm and pleasant evening which we spent on deck viewing the stars and Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy and cold. smooth sea and fair breeze. We are about enter- ing the St George’s channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle and after straining our eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20 days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish coast, and also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, and rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light houses andc. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side ^the^ coast and^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle and noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds and waves andc. We reached the pilote ground at daylight and raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appeared and came along side and sent a pilot on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not yet arived and she left New York 5 days before we did. and that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool and she left New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner communicated before the steam ship Liverpool here in sight behind us and was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale and we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight and an English steam Boat soon came and took us in tow and soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed and fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. and Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, and Independance should all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days and the other 10 before the Oxford but so it was… Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health and spirits and for the first time I began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. and visited some of the  most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, andc. all of which were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, and vegitables that I ever saw The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson’s Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high and 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day. Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns FIGURES in his hand, and death stands by his side partly covered with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, and garnishing the out side of the buil- -ldings in the cities and towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, and gases, that rise from the dens population and burning of coal andc., the air is vary heavy and bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it vary singular to hear the Rector's, and Curit’s preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof and professing religion without having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite cozy and simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were ENDENTRY quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing has attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich and poor male and female, their cloth may be equally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear as tasty and flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit their dead in vaults in the church yard and them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in and out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be taken from the ship and go to the custom House and by examined by the Officer. and after much jaming, crouding and  rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks and baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books and papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at preston. and for the first mile the cars   run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings and inhabitants were over our heads. The cars run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand and it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once more behold this Brother face to face and all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to and from the the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in Preston on Jan 17th and the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool and Elders Manchester and Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston and its neighbourhood and Willford Woodruff and Potteries and warn the People in that place and then inquire the mind of the Lord and if it is his will go to Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons and Birmingham 300,000 and the place is larger than New york and is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston and in company with Elders Turley and Clark took the rail car and rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton and many Saints. Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls and is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members and the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother to visit a sister possessed with the devil and a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage and required 3 or 4 men to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her and commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and also rebuked the fever and after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, and the fever left her, and she was come calm and composed. The devel entered into her child next morning and made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child and rebuked the devil in the name of Jesus Christ and he instantly came out and the child fell asleep, and the woman attended meeting during the day I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester and in company with Elder Turley took coach and road (on the outside as the custom is) through Alfred Corden This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most of the English china, crockery and stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon he went 40 miles to recieve the work and be baptzed and was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a week for his daily bread and preaches evry evening in a week and 3 times on Sunday and he has alredy a little flock of Saints of 66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order and dissipline; the Saints have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, and my prayer to God is that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon and labour while the day last for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Scotland have began to preach and to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, and the doctors told him to take medicine and keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick and soon got well. persecution does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks and candles flung at their heads while preaching and occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followed me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem and Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded and attentive congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns and vary populous and whare they have not as yet herd the word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England and contains a large number of inha bitants and will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries and Birmingham. and we have already given out appointments part of the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey and of the country andc. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times and the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern country. Signs, wonders, and fearful sights are appearing, and the words of the Ancient and modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London  so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford’s bog land rose up from its mighty bed and travled with the rapidity  of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in  angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over  and in addition to these and many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen and parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to to protect them, and they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel  war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going through the streets begging Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories and out of  Employ and bread in one day, and I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting  what to do, and in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity and sin as well as trouble and distress and it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question andc. for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort the Saints to be as quiet as possible and be subject to the Laws of the Land and the powers that be. but it  requires the greatest of prudence and wisdom to hold public meetings and do the work of God in this country at the present time and under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe and must spedily be   ENDENTRY be reapted if the wheat is sowed. and God is assisting his servents in this country, and the work is begining to roll forth  more and more whare it is faithfully proclaimed and signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I  believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in Birmingham and that all of the capitol  places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth  to come forth from some quarter and they appear willing to hear, receive and imbrace it when it comes unto  them and while we are preaching and baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to  preach and baptize in Scotland and thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week and several times on the  Sabbath and baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation and a man  came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon- ism unveiled John F Boyanton Boynton. andc andc I was informed  the man was a Methodist preacher and brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him  to read it what we could by giving him lights, and water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury I answered him when he got through, and the people herd my answer with attention. All stories and reports that were  afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come  out and hear andc. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but  you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country and the vine yard of the Lord andc in this land. But I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you  by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved  but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or  8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary  anxious to hear from you and Sarah Emma and also about the Church around you, perhaps you may have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want  you to write as soon as you get this, wont you and give me an account of all matters and things  with you and Sarah, how your health is, and how you get along for help; food and rament, is their war between  New Orleans was destroyed by  the Commerce  tell me all about it. are they publishing the times and Seasons. give my respects to all the friends in Lovely Street, Montrose, and Commerce as far as you have an opportunity.

It is a long direc^t^ion I know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to New York or it will not come but if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y.  also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois and diret the post Master to inform you of it  I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. and I do pray my heavenly Father that you may obtain this letter. and that it may not page torn be written in vain.

Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle and preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited  the large silk factory in New Castle and seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom whare ribbons, sattins, and silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, and while the sun  shines beatiful and pleasant, the parks, walks, and fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit  down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke  of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. and now Phebe wont you sit down and do so by me give  me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you and Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git a large sheet and fill it full. I want to know about the sickness and who is dead. and what Washington and what the prospect is concerning the Church and its progress in America.

I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through and again meet with my family But my Dear Friend and Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and warn the people of this generation, and prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-   page torn -paired for the coming of the Son of Man. and if we are faithful in this great work, and do the will of Jesus Christ and are  wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended and the victory won, then how sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward and how Eternal our happiness. and May the Lord  Jesus Christ intercede for us, and all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he  comes we may be like him and reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen  I remain forever your Companion and Friend  Willford Woodruff  Phebe W.

Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U T  Dear Brother, Dec 29, 1860.  I owe you many apologies for not earlier answering your kind letter of the 20th Ult. ins I have written to my family in the city but once since I left, and have seen my Sanpete but about three times since the President was here. I have been  very busy in building me a house and in preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean paper. I have written a little through necessity and a very little only. I might urge many othr reasons for not writing sooner, but none for want of a disposition to write. I have not had time even to write a love letter, however strong my in- clinations may have been to do so. I never labor ed with body and mind more intently in my life than during the past season. I Am now reduced to the size of a decent man. But my house is so far finished that my goods are pitched into it, and have left my family to regulate for themselves while I go to Fillmore where I  expect to be on New Years night. I am now on my way there.  Accept my thanks for your Kind attention to my vineyard. It was a swamp ENDENTRY Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep and at this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We have had a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last when the snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We have no wind storms to do us any serious damage in the county with the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meeting house at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reason of a door being left open and the house being tight, it had to burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no human lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lord said, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and death are our common lot; and though the summons be direct against us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandate Sickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and death the gate through which the just enter into it.  Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something more than a political Mormon, I hope. He has an extensive mission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to  the cause.  The road from the Spanish Fork is worked through for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make it a good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much more labor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for an appropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counsel or suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirable to me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too much already for individual aggrandizement with the view of public good. I have counseled the people to forward their ENDENTRY Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding them to a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round and says, "you can't do any thing—it is the height of nonsense to ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can be bought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." We want men who can do something. "You can't, you can't" never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdom of God. But when stray cattle are required to pay private liabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no priva cy. It  Two weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse in Manti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discourse that I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters, yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthen had been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears, others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power of God enabled me to tell things about as existing evidence will substantiate them. One remarked that that discourse caused many a drooping branch to lift up its head It was a faithful warning to evil doers.  When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legisla ture, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tis  Lincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done. The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help  all parties on in the way they want to go.  The people are gathered for meeting so I must stop writing and go to preaching  6 o'clock Sunday evening and all is well. Your Brother in the gospel  Orson Hyde ENDENTRY P.S. Gardner Snow of Manti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He is a very good man; but is completely wraped up in his son Sanpete have paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvements can be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. It is like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. Several Back houses have been begun, but I know not one finished The jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract price for completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build and complete a much better building than that would be of finished The county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that are of much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered, the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has suffered The people have suffered by their stoks stock being made into strays and then into beef. The Indian department has suffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations going in the same way. The people of Sanpete think the Bourbons have reigned long enough, and that Bornbas Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed forom Manti to Springtown it would suit the notions of the people much better. If to Moroni M. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown, Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I have expressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county seat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judge yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentieths of the people here would endorse them, the opinion of our representative to the contrary notwithstanding ENDENTRY OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P.O. Box, B. Salt Lake City, Utah. March 19th, 1894.  Elder Cornelius D. Schettler, Dear Brother:  I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our young Elders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission to Owen, and I have liked very much the spirit of them.  Mrs. father and Irene made us splendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and the other boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first mark in the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is; though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on my first mission without purse or srcrip. I went through the wilderness,  waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I could not confirm.  You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinances necessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes in you young men. I suppose you naturally will have some difficulty in preaching to these foreign governments considering the laws and politics. But I think there is a good deal of the blood of Israel in Germany and Switzerland. We have everything to encourage us in searching out hthe honest in heart among the nations. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that if he spent his whole life in saving one soul how great would be his joy in the eternal world over that one soul. I have felt that I have great cause to rejoice in that respect; I have had the credit of bringing more ENDENTRY souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know how that is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England- in Herefordshire, andc., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take any credit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not Wilfeord Woodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be an instrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look upon you young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preach the gospel and save the souls of men.  No greater or more glorious work could you be called to.  Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with all your might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost to be with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls in search of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and give you power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you. And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, and all who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but labor faithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and prepare the earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist all temptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.  Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all the Elders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboring in the vineyard of the Lord.  wife died last week, and will be buried on Sunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are getting along. Sister Alice join me in love to you and Bro. and Sister Naegle.

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother:  When I was appointed to take charge of the Scandinavian Mission, May 1st Bro. Joseph Christiansen turned over to me as "Resources,"  a list of notes due this Offise from parties now in Utah, which notes, according to your suggestions had been sent to you for colection, in order to help this office out with the much needed funds.  I write this by way of a reminder. I will also state, that during the last few months but very little money has been sent from home, to this office for Emigrations; The few emigrants that has goen this summer, has mostly goen on money that has been to thier or here for a long time, and as stated above, but very little has come from home to Reimburse the office.  We have had several calls from home for money, that has been sent here for Emigrations, but when the parties, for whom it was intended could not go "at once", the money was recalled.  I suppose because of the hard times at home and the scarcity of money. All this has drained us interely and we are not now able to remit to Liverpool the full amounts for the emigrations as they go.  If  ENDENTRY De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn, _____, 189_____  we had the cash which these notes represents then we would be allright as far as the emigrations is concerned.  I expect Prest. Lund over here next week and I shall then take great plasure in showing him the condision of the mission financily,  I hope to hear from you favorably on this matter. The work of God is progressing in this lands, many are investigating the Gospel afpecialy in Sweden and if we only had more missionaries to send up there much more good could be done.  I remain yours in the Gospel of christ  C. A. Carlquist  Bro. Jack sayes, we are doing the best we can to collect those notes, but in these hard times, no one seems able to pay,  and there is but little hope of getting the money just now.  Besides the Copenhagen office has drawn on the Lpool office and the latter has drawn on this office, and will no doubt continue to do so.  J. F. S.

Brother Anderson came here last  May and was according to your wish, sent to the  City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the  best school in this country for the study which he  was to pursue—Figure Molding. When Prest.

Dear Brother:  We need thirty missionaries for the Scandinavian Mission as early as possible in the Fall of 1891. As to nationality and dialect, they should be divided as follows: Danish, 8: for Goteborg, Sweden, 12; for Christiania, Norway, 6.  Our progress during the past four months, has averaged that of the past two winters. A number of the older brethren, however, have been unable to work, owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some. As far as I know; all are now well.  The present edition of the Danish Hymn Book is nearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published, the work should be carefully revised, which should be done so that we could send it to press next winter. I think this labor is of great importance, as it is a fact that our hymns have a great influence in spread- ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con- verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest, therefore, that a committee of interested and capable Scandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, to save expence, should be done at home in Utah, and the work sent over here for publication.  To make it what it should be, there are a number of improvements needed ENDENTRY in the book which will be fully apparent to those who undertake the task. The meter should be changed in  a number of the songs so as to make these suitable for our psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodys now used, which are often very inappropriate in a house of worship; and more of the principles and doctrines should be treated upon with less of Zion and the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, but even strangers are often too eager to embrace. A considerable proportion of those who emigrate each year are Gentiles, and our people are continually sending for their friends who care nothing in a num- ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove of great injury to the cause by returning unfavorable writings to these lands, after they are gathered.  Elders C. C. A. Chris- tensen would be among the best that could be found to do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the  assistance of such other talent as might be selected. Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is now working in this office, but who expects to return home  next Fall, would be of much assistance in the work owing to his musical ability, and his familiarity with the wants of choirs and singers in this mission.  Hoping that these matters will received your favorable consideration, and praying God to bless you abundantly, I remain,  Your brother in the Gospel of Christ, Edw. H. Anderson. ENDENTRY Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzengade Nr. 14, 1. Sal. Kjebenhavn Nov. 8 1890  President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother: I have just made a round tour of this  mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returning on the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest.  Young an account in detail of our conferences, and of matters as I found them. The work is progress- ing quite favorably in this mission, and especially do we find many in Northern Sweden who investi- gate the principles of the Gospel. During the past six months there have been 312 baptisms in the  mission.  We will need 20 missionaries next spring,  which should be divided as follows:  Danes—5; from Goteborg, North- ern Sweden—7; from S Kane, southern Sweden— 4; from Norway—4,. We can not use South- ern Swedes for the north part of that country; and as the northern portion is the best field we hope to have the full quota for that part as early as they can be sent over; in fact, it would be well if they were now in the field.  I take the liberty of suggesting that we ENDENTRY Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn 189  need a Danish writer and a Swedish writer, to relieve the brethren who are now laboring in that  calling. It is well to have them on hand, so as to familiarize themselves with their work, some length of time before the present laborers leave. I suggest as the Danish translator Elder O. J. Anderson, of Castle Dale, Emery Co. and as the Swedish translator,  Elder Logan. These brethren should be here early in the summer. We need also some specially qualified men to relieve the  Conference presidents who will return next sum- mer and fall. I suggest the following names from which a selection could be made:  Danes: Mayfield SanpeteCo. Dr. Salina, SevierCo. Richmond CacheCo. Hyrum, Cache Co.  Swedes: Salt Lake City.  Charles Nyman, Logan.  Monroe, Sevier Co. C. A. Carlquist, Salt Lake City  Norwegians: C. H. Monsan, Richmond, Cache Chr: Bouderud, Salina, Sevier Co. Ingebrigt Paulsen, Salina Hans A.

Trusting that these suggestions may not be out of place, and that the subject may receive the consideration that its importance  demands, I remain,  Your humble brother in the cause of God,  Edw. H.

Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City,  Utah  Dear Brother:  I herewith enclose a list of names of persons recommended as being quali- fied and capable of filling missions in Scan- dinavia, and if you deem it proper we would be pleased to have them called and sent to these countries to assist in the work of the Lord. I sent a similar list to Prest. Young at Liver- pool on the 9th Jan., but for some cause it can not now be found there, and, having been mislaid, it has not been forwarded to you.  It is therefore by the suggestion of Prest. Young, or the brother at Liverpool having charge of the mission, that I send this list direct to you.  It is now very late, but these Elders were intended to have been among the Spring supply of missionaries. You have no doubt by this time been informed of the number of needed for Scandinavia -- 30, (12 Swedes, 8 Norwegians  and 10 Danes.)  By request of Prest. Young, I also send you a list of notes due this office from parties most by residing in Utah.  These amounts have been loaned to the respective parties on their promise of paying same as specified in the notes; some ENDENTRY 2  De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hoveddkontor for den skandinaviske Mission Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1.

I would suggest, that these notes be sent to the church office in Salt Lake City for collection, and this office, if possible, get credit for the a- mounts, as the Scandinavian Mission can ill afford to do without the means.  No doubt if the notes are presented for collection at home, the greater portion at least will be paid, but if left here, it is very doubtful. This money was borrowed from amounts on hand here for emigrations purposes, and, besides this amount, we have a borrowed balance from the same source of Kr. 6827.25 or L379.5 "  9 3/4 (about $1845.00)  By this you can judge of our financial condition, and any disposition you can make in favor of the mission is greatly need- ed and will be thankfully received.

Woodruff - and Councilors S L City, Dear Brethren:--  As I did not have the opportunity of seeing you when I called at your Office last week when I returned from my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper to write you and give you a brief report of the Mission and the labor performed there during the last two years.  During those years there have been on an average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives in the field and when I left here there were 150. According to the reports received there has been some 200,000 Families visited by our Elders, and about the same number of tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls have been added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averages from 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in those northern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especially on this advanced in years, not so much on account ENDENTRY of extreme cold, as on account of the damp and heavy atmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of men there now past 60 and where they have to take their chances in the field in common write others it is almost more than they are able to stand.  The Elders have with scarsely an exception labored dilligently  and with good success and the blessings and power of god have followed them in their ministry.  We have on various occasions seen the power of God made manifest in a remarkable manner.  The sick have been restored to health where they in some instances had been lying on their beds of affliction for many years and to all human appearance there was but little or no hope for their recovery.-  We have met with but very little interference from government officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has been to respect and honor those to whom honor was due, and to observe the laws of the countries where we were laboring and exercise love and charity for all and malice toward none, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect. On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banished from Denmark, this was done on complaints centered by the Ministers of the State Church who thought they were annoying them by their presence.-- ENDENTRY under those circumstances we have simply transfered them to Sweden or Norway.  Some 300 have emigrated from that mission during the past two years, and nearly all on money sent them by their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have been instructed not to encourage Emigration, but rather encourage the Saints to remain and help to build up and strengthen the branches of the Church where they are has proven a great benefit to our work in those lands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives are among our very best missionaries  We have encouraged the Saints everywhere, although poor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard many enspiring testimonies from them how the Lord has made good His promises and blessed them as a reward for their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinavia do not seem to be so hospitable as are the people of the U S hence our Elders find it very difficult to travel without money, but as a rule the manager to get along with a little.  The general feeling and Spirit among the people is more liberal and tolerant then years go, and the prejudin so strong and pronmuced against us in early days, is much modified.  One great drawback to our work in ENDENTRY the cities is the want of suitable, and I may say  respectable, places where to hold our religious services we have encouraged a bettering of conditions in that line.  We have in all the Conferences and in many of the principle branches, good choirs provided with organs, and they are a great help to our work, but we have been much in need of men of talent in that line. -  The Gospel is more and more attracting the attention of the more intelligent and better classes of the people and there is at present an exellent prospect for the work in Scandinavia.  I am not enclined to share in the sentiment often expressed by our Elders: that the harvest is over and we are but gleaning, but rather think that the precious seed sown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest - The mission was a few years ago involved in a heavy debt, part of that was canceled by Prest P. Sundwall, my predecessor, and I am pleased to be able ^now^ to report the mission out of debt and in a good footing financially as well as otherwise. ENDENTRY #2  Elder George Christensen, who has been by your appointed to take charge of the mission temporarly, has labored with me in the office for the past two years, part of the time as writer and translator for the danish Star, and has rendered me very valuable assistance, he is a young man of exceptional abilities, and well qualified for the position he now fills. -  We are also publishing a Star in the Swedish language, of which Elder Geo, A. Brandt of Salina is the writer and translator. -  Personally I feel pleased to return to my family friends at home, and find all well --.  My mission has been full of interest and experiences to me and I trust it has been of course profit to the work of God and the people among where I have labored.

Björkman, who died ^in^ 19 inst. at Solvarbo, Sweden, Chaving now received full particulars, we deem it proper to forward same to you. A full account of his labors, death and burial has been sent to his family.  Elder Andrew Björkman was born in Björklinge, Upland, Sweden, Jan. 22, 1838. ^He^ Rreceived the Gospel, by Baptism, May 18, 1864, and emigrated to Utah in 1869. He arrived here as a Missionary, June 29, 1895, and was appointed by Pres. Sunduvall to labor in Stockholm Conference. His field of labor was Solvarbo Branch in Dalarne, where he, in connection with Elder Lennberg, has performed a good work, laboring there until death call him hence.  A day or two before his death he separated from Elder Len^n^berg, making an appointment to meet him a few days later. Elder Björkman remained in Solvarbo to prepare the report of the Branch to be forwarded to Stockholm.  On the 19th of Aug, he seemed to be in his usual health and partook of dinner with the family of Saints with  whom he was staying. After dinner he went with them into the field where the work of harvesting was going on. ENDENTRY De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjobenhavn, 189  3  Keep clean 4 6 Min #2  A few minutes later, a member of the family discovered him lying on the ground. Hastening to his side, they found him apparently lifeless, and all attemp^t^s to arouse him proved in vain. A physician was then sum- moned who after a brief examination, pronounced him dead, ^and gave as the cause a bursting of a bloodvessel in the head,^ stating that death had come without pain.  As Solvarbo is located in a sparsely settled and mountainous region some 130 miles from Stockholm, means of communication are very primitive, and two days lapsed before the Saints could find his partner, Elder Lennberg, who, when found, wired the sad news to Stockholm and thence it was forwarded here. A letter was sent from here to the Office at Liverpool, containing the news; but we waited for further particulars before sending the  word home, as we did not know where he died, nor the address of his family, or whether word had been sent to them from Sweden. Further particulars could not be had here until the Brethren from Stockholm reached the scene of his death, which necessarily consumed considerable time. Upon receipt of the first news from Solvarbo we wired you, and having just now received a complete account of the death and funeral, forward you same.  As soon as Bro. Ahlquist, President of Stockholm Conference, and the Elders with him arrived, necessary steps were imme- diately taken for the funeral, Temple clothing having been prepared ENDENTRY De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission.

At 4 o'clock, Aug. 25 1896 the funeral services were commenced, a congretation of about 200 persons, mostly strangers,  having gathered in to pay their last respects to Bro. Björkman. The services were conducted as on such occassions at home.  The speakers were Elders A. Petersen and E. Lennberg, all from Zion, who all spoke feelingly of the excellent qualities of the deceased, and bore powerful testimonies to the large assembly.  After the dedicatory prayer had been offered by Pres. Ahlquist, the mortal remains of Elder Björkman were consigned to the silent tomb. He lies buried in a lovely spot in the Gustafs Cemetery in Dalarne, Sweden. Much credit is due to Pres. Ahlquist and the Brethren with him, who did all in their power that Brother Björkman might be laid to rest in a proper man- ner, befitting a servant of God.  While we would ^have liked^ very much ^had^ liked to have been present at the funeral of our Brother, the information as to where he died, and where and when he would be buried, did not reach us in time, the distance from here being some over 500 miles, and we felt sure that that the Brethren who were there would do all that could be done.  It is very sad that one of our brethren should thus ENDENTRY De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.

Our deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends, and we invoke the blessings of God upon them in this their hour of sorrow.  The Elders laboring in this Mission are zealous in their effors to spread the Gospel, and in most parts are meeting with gratifying success.

York Our journey from Salt Lake was rather hard, however we got along well, the last 400 miles are tough down the Humbolt and over the mountains. How very, very much I want to visit Salt Lake. I feel quite dissatisfied in leaving so soon. I feel much more interest in it now than formerly, it appears to me that I hardly saw you at all even after going so long a distance for almost exclusively that express business. Was it not for the great fatigue of the journey across the plains I would return that way but I possess hardly usual cemaye enough to undertake an other such trip.  I was glad to hear that Dr. B. had paid that dept. I was not uneasy about it as it had Brother Tamgs name on it that will be quite a help toward my settling my old affairs ENDENTRY sideways text I F Carter end of sideways text  and a settlement of them is something. God knows that I greatly desire. I am like a broken stick, of no account can do nothing no I desire. I feel it most deeply, and really hope that something may turn up whereby I may extricate myself I do not desire great wealth, that is not my object, society friends and relatives I prize much higher, with a privilege of living just as we shall wish we had when we came to die. This has been my wish and determination for years past to do as near what is right as possible, to do unto others just as I would have another do unto me, but we will do wrong sometimes particularly when we are not under the influence of a higher power.  I feel very thankful that I spent the last night as I did in Salt Lake, the influence is very great on me, many views of the church coincide with my aim, that is, all with which I am fa miliar, some I know nothing of, which I shall leave with time to determine. We have had the advantages of a pious education, a pious Mother whose prayers have been long and frequent  and fervent for our future happiness and hope we shall fully appreciate them. I have been Providentially spared. I feel that I  have not deserved such loving kindness from the hands of a Supreme Being but the mind is tempered to the slian lamb and I am I hope truly thankful for his recollections of my wants and circumstances  On my way from this place to Sacramento I shall go by Salmon falls and try to find Calvin, hope he has been successful I should like much to meet with something by which I could make a few thousand, this winter will be as favorable a time as any I think to settle my old business should you be able to collect something in those accounts and forward let us much as possible be in American and foreign coin is the best I can do with valley coin is 20 pr. ct. discount and many refuse it at that there is a man in Baltimore that is owing me an important amount, was unfortunate in business, should I chance to get that I should be all right, hope such a thing may phappen presume you see my letter from the plains by Brown.

Elder James W. Bean,  Stake Clerk, Utah Stake.  DEAR BROTHER:  Your communication of the 27th. inst., addressed to myself and the Quorum of the Twelve, informs me that, in accordance with a resolution adopted by the unanimous vote of the priesthood of Utah Stake, you send your communica- tion asking for ten thousand dollars -$10000.00- of the tithing of the Stake for the current year, to aid you in the completion of the Utah Stake Tabernacle.  The position of the Church in financial matters is such at the present time that it is impossible for us to comply with this resolution. We shall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession, or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage- ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostles some weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for the benefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number of applications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their order when circumstances become more favorable. The case at which the Council stopped ENDENTRY was one that appealed very strongly to their sympathies, but it was thought that it was a good place to stop at, as there would probably be no other case that would be likely to call forth aid more strongly than it. The present prospect is that we shall need all the tithing tahat we can collect to meet outstanding engagements and to pay our currect expenses; and if we can do this without contracting debts, we shall feel happy.  Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to the priesthood of Utah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,  I remain, Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY Copy Salt Lake City, Utah April 7, 1881 Dear Bro. John W. Young, Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Young and Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall  by the First Presidency of the church in counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge of the interests of the saints and the care and oversight of all their parties which might be working on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gande and Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading, furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to make contracts and to asist in making contracts in their interests, and instruct and counsel  them in the duties of their religion, and in  the management of their busness affairs, and in securing the means that should be  due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter  of Instructions was written by the First  Presidency for the guidance of these Elders and yourself in the duties assigned to you, in which you were directed to do everything  necessary to give all equal rights in the various jobs and you were instructed to see that the supplies should be provided Rubyech to the action or adjustment of the Various boards, no one man, or a few men to receive the profits there from and that everything was to be done in the mlerch of all.  That ENDENTRY Letter said "I wish to impress upon you and the brethren who will labor in the conjunction with you, that it is not the privelege of any man or company of men to take advantage of the circumstances of the people and their necessities and farm them out for their private profit.  As latter day-Saints we are all equal, and we should  labor for each other's benefit--and no man  should selfishly build himself up or enrich himself at the expense of his brother or brethren.  If he has superior advantages either of position or of skill, let him have a fair remumeration there for;but beyond  this he should not go.  He should labor as we  all should for the welfare, advancement and  prosperity of the people.  In this way good  feeling will be maintained and the saints  will see that their leading men are their true friends, and are not disposed to oppress them and to make mechandise of them.  There is freah room for the mereaso of confidence in this direction, and we hope that you will  dr use all your influence in creating their con- fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If we take this course and act together in this manner among ourselves, and maintains the same principles of equity in our dealings with other who are ENDENTRY not of us, the reputation of the Latter-day- Saints will be greatly increased and influence will be created in our favor that will result in  incalculable benefit to us as a people, for  the world is so destitute of these qualities that when people witness them they are im- pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledge their worth. as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you  perform among the people in counselling, in directing, in securing contracts and in seemy that all the business is properly alleuded to, and that the pay can be relied upon, you should derive a reasonable percentage.  We  have thought that in view of all the expenses connected with the labor, five per cent would be a proper amount; but of course when you many other agents secure contracts and perform other labor connected there with, for this small percentage, it should not be expected that you will, in the event of the  company failing to make payments, be responisble for the Day." since the return of the elders Erastus Snow  and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N. Smith submitted a memorandum in writing to you embodying some of the principal points of the letter of instructions and requiring you to hold ENDENTRY sacred the money received in estimates for grading less the maount necessary for to pay for supples furnished and sking for your action on your part with them in securing to the sub contractors just dues under the contracts mad eiwhtthem by Elders Brigham Young  and Jesse N. smith.  Mis. Memo: they signed and requested you to sign, but we are in- formed you declined to do so, thought, you had  telegraphed, upon receipt of the letter of instructions that you accepted and would be governed by the provisions of that letter and this was, and is the under= standding of the entire Council res= pecting your telegrams to Brother Brigham.  Viewing your action in  refusing to sign this memorandum submittd to you as a vioation of the Letter of instructions and a breach of faith with the Coun= cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Council of the Twelve Apostles has de- cided that it could not present your ame at the Conferenc eto the people as a counsellor.  It was therefore omitted without ENDENTRY comment.  The Council has also decided that you be summon= ed to appear before it in this  City forth with to show cause why you hould not be dealt with accorning to the laws of the Church for this conduct.
