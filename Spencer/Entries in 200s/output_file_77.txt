This expedition will constitute a new epoch in the annals of the everlasting kingdom, that will be conspicuous for worlds to come for the energy enterprize &amp; indefatigable endurance of the performance The results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthy and glorious.

The past year has been one of great prosperity as to the enlargement of the Church in this Island &amp; the increase of faith and diligence &amp; zeal in the work of the Lord.

I need not inform you that it will be very necessary. I have increased the number of our Paper during the year about 5 or six hundred.

I have in the absence of Pres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld. Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposing him to be the proper authority to counsel me.   go elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidence of the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lord as it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres. Young when he appointed me to this mission and lately repeated &amp; formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz not to walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in office almost inclined me to look over my geography to see in what part of the world it is that they poke one horse because another horse is unruly. My heart is  sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate and now sick little children &amp; I could return to them with joy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with  the faith &amp; support of all Israel &amp; hope ever to merit the same by well doing.

My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey &amp; of the country &amp;c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times &amp; the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern country. Signs, wonders, &amp; fearful sights are appearing, &amp; the words of the Ancient &amp; modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London  so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford’s bog land rose up from its mighty bed &amp; travled with the rapidity  of a steam Engine for the distance of  angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over  &amp; in addition to these &amp; many other signs  of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen &amp; parliment depend upon the M to protect them, &amp; they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel  war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going through the streets begging Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories &amp; out of  Employ &amp; bread in one day, &amp; I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting  what to do, &amp; in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity &amp; sin as well as trouble &amp; distress &amp; it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &amp;c. for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort the Saints to be as quiet as possible &amp; be subject to the Laws of the Land &amp; the powers that be. but it  requires the greatest of prudence &amp; wisdom to hold public meetings &amp; do the work of God in this country at the present time &amp; under the present state of things.

I  believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in Birmingham &amp; that all of the capitol  places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth  to come forth from some quarter &amp; they appear willing to hear, receive &amp; imbrace it when it comes unto  them &amp; while we are preaching &amp; baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to  preach &amp; baptize in Scotland &amp; thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth.

I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England- in Herefordshire, &amp;c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take any credit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not Wilf Woodruff that did it.

I write this by way of a reminder. I will also state, that during the last few months but very little money has been sent from home, to this office for Emigrations; The few emigrants that has goen this summer, has mostly goen on money that has been to thier or here for a long time, and as stated above, but very little has come from home to Reimburse the office.  We have had several calls from home for money, that has been sent here for Emigrations, but when the parties, for whom it was intended could not go "at once", the money was recalled.  I suppose because of the hard times at home and the scarcity of money. All this has drained us interely and we are not now able to remit to Liverpool the full amounts for the emigrations as they go.  If  ENDENTRY  for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.     then we would be allright as far as the emigrations is concerned.  I expect Prest.

The work of God is progressing in this lands, many are investigating the Gospel afpecialy in Sweden and if we only had more missionaries to send up there much more good could be done.       can to collect those notes, but in these hard times, no one seems able to pay,  and there is but little hope of getting the money just now.   on this office, and will no doubt continue to do so.

Brother Anderson came here last  May and was according to your wish, sent to the  City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the  best school in this country for the study which he  was to pursue—Figure Molding. When Prest.

A number of the older brethren, however, have been unable to work, owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some. As far as I know; all are now well.   nearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published, the work should be carefully revised, which should be done so that we could send it to press next winter. I think this labor is of great importance, as it is a fact that our hymns have a great influence in spread- ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con- verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest, therefore, that a committee of interested and capable Scandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, to save expence, should be done at home in Utah, and the work sent over here for publication.  To make it what it should be, there are a number of improvements needed ENDENTRY  undertake the task. The meter should be changed in  a number of the songs so as to make these suitable for our psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodys now used, which are often very inappropriate in a house of worship; and more of the principles and doctrines should be treated upon with less of Zion and the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, but even strangers are often too eager to embrace. A considerable proportion of those who emigrate each year are Gentiles, and our people are continually sending for their friends who care nothing in a num- ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove of great injury to the cause by returning unfavorable writings to these lands, after they are gathered.   tensen would be among the best that could be found to do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the  assistance of such other talent as might be selected. Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is now working in this office, but who expects to return home  next Fall, would be of much assistance in the work owing to his musical ability, and his familiarity with the wants of choirs and singers in this mission.   favorable consideration, and praying God to bless you abundantly, I remain,   Edw.

I have just made a round tour of this  mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returning on the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest.  Young an account in detail of our conferences, and of matters as I found them. The work is progress- ing quite favorably in this mission, and especially do we find many in Northern Sweden who investi- gate the principles of the Gospel. During the past six months there have been 312 baptisms in the  mission.   which should be divided as follows:  Danes—5; from Goteborg, North- ern Sweden—7; from S Kane, southern Sweden— 4; from Norway—4 ern Swedes for the north part of that country; and as the northern portion is the best field we hope to have the full quota for that part as early as they can be sent over; in fact, it would be well if they were now in the field.

We need also some specially qualified men to relieve the  Conference presidents who will return next sum- mer and fall.

No doubt if the notes are presented for collection at home, the greater portion at least will be paid, but if left here, it is very doubtful.

Mission ENDENTRY    ENDENTRY  June 24 + 1898   and Councilors S L City, Dear Brethren:--   when I called at your Office last week when I returned from my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper to write you and give you a brief report of the Mission and the labor performed there during the last two years.  During those years there have been on an average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives in the field and when I left here there were 150. According to the reports received there has been some 200,000 Families visited by our Elders, and about the same number of tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls have been added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averages from 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in those northern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especially on this advanced in years, not so much on account ENDENTRY  atmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of men there now past 60 and where they have to take their chances in the field in common write others it is almost more than they are able to stand.   and with good success and the blessings and power of god have followed them in their ministry.  We have on various occasions seen the power of God made manifest in a remarkable manner.  The sick have been restored to health where they in some instances had been lying on their beds of affliction for many years and to all human appearance there was but little or no hope for their recovery.-   government officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has been to respect and honor those to whom honor was due, and to observe the laws of the countries where we were laboring and exercise love and charity for all and malice toward none, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect. On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banished from Denmark, this was done on complaints centered by the Ministers of the State Church who thought they were annoying them by their presence.-- ENDENTRY  them to Sweden or Norway.   the past two years, and nearly all on money sent them by their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have been instructed not to encourage Emigration, but rather encourage the Saints to remain and help to build up and strengthen the branches of the Church where they are has proven a great benefit to our work in those lands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives are among our very best missionaries   poor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard many enspiring testimonies from them how the Lord has made good His promises and blessed them as a reward for their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinavia do not seem to be so hospitable as are the people of the U S hence our Elders find it very difficult to travel without money, but as a rule the manager to get along with a little.  The general feeling and Spirit among the people is more liberal and tolerant then years go, and the prejudin so strong and pronmuced against us in early days, is much modified.  One great drawback to our work in ENDENTRY  respectable, places where to hold our religious services we have encouraged a bettering of conditions in that line.

I am not enclined to share in the sentiment often expressed by our Elders: that the harvest is over and we are but gleaning, but rather think that the precious seed sown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest - The mission was a few years ago involved in a heavy debt, part of that was canceled by Prest P.

We shall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession, or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage- ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostles some weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for the benefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number of applications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their order when circumstances become more favorable.

Utah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,   Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY  Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Bro. John W. Young, Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Young and Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall  by the First Presidency of the church in counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge of the interests of the saints and the care and oversight of all their parties which might be working on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gande and Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading, furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to make contracts and to asist in making contracts in their interests, and instruct and counsel  them in the duties of their religion, and in  the management of their busness affairs, and in securing the means that should be  due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter  of Instructions was written by the First  Presidency for the guidance of these Elders and yourself in the duties assigned to you, in which you were directed to do everything  necessary to give all equal rights in the various jobs and you were instructed to see that the supplies should be provided Rubyech to the action or adjustment of the Various boards, no one man, or a few men to receive the profits there from and that everything was to be done in the mlerch of all.  That ENDENTRY  "I wish to impress upon you and the brethren who will labor in the conjunction with you, that it is not the privelege of any man or company of men to take advantage of the circumstances of the people and their necessities and farm them out for their private profit.  As latter day-Saints we are all equal, and we should  labor for each other's benefit--and no man  should selfishly build himself up or enrich himself at the expense of his brother or brethren.  If he has superior advantages either of position or of skill, let him have a fair remumeration there for;but beyond  this he should not go.  He should labor as we  all should for the welfare, advancement and  prosperity of the people.  In this way good  feeling will be maintained and the saints  will see that their leading men are their true friends, and are not disposed to oppress them and to make mechandise of them.  There is freah room for the mereaso of confidence in this direction, and we hope that you will   fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If we take this course and act together in this manner among ourselves, and maintains the same principles of equity in our dealings with other who are ENDENTRY  Saints will be greatly increased and influence will be created in our favor that will result in  incalculable benefit to us as a people, for  the world is so destitute of these qualities that when people witness them they are im- pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledge their worth. as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you  perform among the people in counselling, in directing, in securing contracts and in seemy that all the business is properly alleuded to, and that the pay can be relied upon, you should derive a reasonable percentage.  We  have thought that in view of all the expenses connected with the labor, five per cent would be a proper amount; but of course when you many other agents secure contracts and perform other labor connected there with, for this small percentage, it should not be expected that you will, in the event of the  company failing to make payments, be responisble for the Day." since the return of the elders Erastus Snow  and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N.

Viewing your action in  refusing to sign this memorandum submittd to you as a vioation of the Letter of instructions and a breach of faith with the Coun= cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Council of the Twelve Apostles has de- cided that it could not present your ame at the Conferenc eto the people as a counsellor.
