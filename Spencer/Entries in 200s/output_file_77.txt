We ask  your aid in saving these lives and all the sufferings  incident to a civil war. We believe that you are in  sympathy with so just and patriotic a cause as ours  and trust that you will accompany your reply with  a contribution, proportionate to your sympathy, the  receipt of which will be duly acknowledged and your

The upright part is  27 ft by 16 ft 1 1/2 story high with a one story back for  back rooms the whole intended for an ell to the main  building when erected. It is builed Flemish band of  brick burned bricks the strechers are red and the  headers white which with the white cut stone window  and Door caps and sills formes a beautifull front  Bro Westly Willis is building this house and when  finished as he intends to do it would be an ornament  to any city. There is but three other houses on the  whole plat one a small adobie one a log and a  hole in the ground    We left Cedar City on the 16th of of Nov with  bro Roundy & Williams with us making a 9 nine  in all in the company their loading was Flour & Oats  We traveled to warm spring or Little Painter Creek  about twenty miles from Cedar here we camped and al-  lowed the animals to run loos over night the next  morning three of them were missing. The brethren hunted  for them three days without finding them and had come  to the conclusion that they had returned to Cedar City &  bro Jones had just sent to men back to hunt for  them there when they came into camp of there own  accord. Another man was soon dispacth to bring the other  two ^men^ back the[y] did not return until the next evening which  made four days that we were detained at this place    We started on our Journey again on the 21st and  passed through Painter Creek Valley. Here Bro R. C. Allen  with some of the Indian missionaries have commenced  to make a new settlement and intend to finish the  Fort next season The Valley is a small one and ^the land & water^ is not  sufficient to sustain but a few families The range is good  and extensive. We had a heavy snow storm on us whle the  first night we camped on the Santa Clara which lasted for  two nights and one day. The snow was from four to eight  inches deep on the divide betwen the Santa Clara and Rio  Vergin which is an uncommon thing to be seen at any season of  the year. At this divide we commence traveling over a  desolate country which might truthfully be called the   desert. We had unusual cold weather while traveling  down the Virgin and the sand being wet and sometimes  frose caused the wagons to role very heavy which made it  hard on the teams and the feed being poor we were oblige^d^  to let the animals run loos nights and although there  was a guard through the darkness of the night they would  manage to get away nearly every night and some times woul^d^  be found ten miles back on the road and always as far that  way as they could get. We arrived at the Muddy on the 24nd ^of Dec^ the place  that has been represented as a good place for a settlement but for the life of me I  could not see nor immagine where they Land ether for plowing meadow or  range could be found neither wood nor timber We saw more Indians at this  place than at any other on the road they appeared to be quite friendly We started across  the desert on the 3rd 1st and arrived at Los Vegas (called by some at that place  Lost Baggis which is a very appropreate name for it) on the 4th    While here I learned that there were divisions, contentions & dissatisfaction  among the brethren here and nearly every one were on the point of leaving some  to the north and some to Sanbarnadino Callifornia but when bro Jones  showed them the letters fro Prest Young which droped Prest Bringhurst from  the presidency at this place and placing Bro Samuel Thompson in his place  there was quite a change which I hope will be for the better. There is not  farming land enough to sustain more than ten families and they would have  to farm on a small scale the range is very poor snow fell about 21  inches deep here a few days before we arrived a thing never known before by the  oldest inhabitants. We arrived at the Diggins on the 8th which is in a high  range of mountains about 350 miles from Los Vegas in a south west course  Bro Jones immediately after our arrival commenced to make the necessary preperations to  commencing ^to^ melting out the Lead

And inasmuch as I am counsiled  by my Parents to whom I will  have to look to for support  I ask your kindness to grant  me the much desired favor,  and during the meantime I will  make every effort possible to  equip myself for a successful  missionary.    Your Brother in the Gospel    W. E. Robinson    Bp. Wm D. Robinson, reports  in person, that this young man  is well able to go to the Islands on  a mission at any time. Says  he would like to go to the S. States  instead of the Islands, and that  if he should be called to the States   he could go in 3 months, &c.    I think he had better go to the  S. States, as it may not be  well to press him to go to the Islands  when he has set himself against  it.    Bp Robinson will be in for  an answer on Thursday,  about noon.  J. F. S.  Apr 13, 1896

(leaveing Salt Lake  City Oct 20th 1897.) Whare in he accepts of the call,  but States he has not a testamoney or knowledge of or  for him Self concerning the Gosple. While this is  no doubt true, he at the same time do not doubt  so far as I can learn from him the is a young ^man^  of goodely perants. Strictely morral so far as I   know, have taken an active part in Young  Mens Assoction, have atended the B. Y. A at Provo  the last two years, have good motives and diseres,  yet open spoken of him self in his views and  position, he is a Single man. Is a Tithe prayer,  and is all or more as he professes to he ^Seems to me^, and with  cultavation and expierance in humility will be a good  missionery, after have some conversation upon the  Subject matter. I felt justifide in indorseing his letter,  not with standing his opne acknowledgement tharein.  trusting I have done nothin rong in so doing. and if  I should have. a corection will be most graciously  reaceived. with this explanation.

I send you today under an other cover, a  lithographic picture of yourself, which I by the  approbation of the leading brethren have made  (being a lithographer myself and working in that  trade) as many of the saints have expressed their  desire of having a good and lasting picture of  our venerable leader to adorne their home. I have  also hope of pecuniary interest as I long for  the day when I and family can gather with the  saints of God in the peaceful vales of Zion, and  it being impossible for me to get there by the earn^ings^  from my dayly labor, hence I have ventured this  little enterprise and hereby ask for your approval.    your humble brother in the gospel of Christ,    Peter S.

But the travel in the wilderness  will not last as long only from the time of the  takeing away the dailey secrafice and setting up the  abomination that maketh desolate Daniel XIth chapt  31st v to the 12 chapt 7 v which is a time times and a half  Daniel sais I heard but I understood not and the question  is repeated and the answer given that from the time  of the above mentioned takes place 11th v 1290 days. It is poss-  ible that I may be mistaken in this but I believe  that 1335 days means the time when the saints under  God will have overcome their enemies and are thurough  ly established and begin to build up Zion in earnest;  and the 4 chapter of Micha is fulfilled from the  8th v to the end of the chapt.
