God blessed  Abram and made Covenants with him and his seed. Though  Israel was in slavery as it were under Pharrio yet when  they cryed unto God and was humble God raised up Moses and delivered them and cursed the Egyptian nation and overthrew them, God overthrew the Canaanite  and gave the land to Israel. ##Exodus 3## Nation after Nation has  risen flourish and fallen from generation to generation  Babylon the excellency of the Chaldeans, and the glory of  kingdoms was in her turn lade in the dust, and while  the curse of God rested upon many nations for their  sins and for Israel's sake. Israel forgot her God and  turned to Idols, and proved the Lord to be equal in  all his ways by scattering Israel to the four winds  of heaven overthrowing Jerrusalem laying her pallaces Synnagogues, and Temples, in the dust to be trodden down  by the gentiles while Judah was driven like the dumb  Ass under his burthen scattered among all nations as corn  was sifted in a sive The gentile nations took her lands  was grafted in whare Israel was broaken of and partook  of the fatness of her olive tree and for a short season  broat forth her fruit, then Rome arose and Greece  in her turn have both spread themselves like a green  bay tree and strove to have their branches reach to  heaven while built upon Judah ruin, who at the  same time is recieving double at the hand of God for  all his sins, Greece and Rome in ther turn fall to the ground,  and out of Rome comes forth ten kingdoms who are now  struggling for the mastery to sway the septure oer the  earth, But in vain, in vain, do ye strive O! ye gentiles  for this thing, ye are ownly fuel for the fire and tinder  for the Breath of the Almighty. Ye have not continued  in the goodness of God neither have ye sought to recover  Israel. WO, WO, WO, unto you Rome for you are  the mother of harlots and Wo unto all your daughte rs England and America not excepted, your destru ction is sure, your condemnation lingereth not and  your Damnation slumbereth not, for you are all  drunk with the Blood of Saints you have spoiled  Judah and Ephram you have trodden down But he  will rise again and fullfill the word of God on thee!!

Young and H. C. Kimball  The following are short extracts from the History of  the TOWER OF LONDON  The Tower is situated on the east side of the  city, about eight hundred yayrds from London  bridge near the bank of the River Thames. This imp- ressive edifice, at first consisted of no more than  what at present is called the white Tower, and with- out any authority, has been reported to have been  built by JULIUS CÆSAR, though there is the strongest evidence of its being marked out, and a part of it first  erected by William the Conqueror, in the year  -  - 1078 FIGURES It contains three Batteries, the first is called the Devils Battery, second Stone Battery third  Wooden Battery mounted with Cann. FIGURES The Tower was a Palace during five hundred  years, and ownly ceased to be so on the accession  of Queen Penant, "fell the meek usurper Henry VI by the dagger  of the Profligate Gloucester. Here full of horrors  died by the hands of hired ruffians, the unsteady  Clarance. who can read without Shuddering  his dreadful dream, which Shakespear makes  him relate to the Lieutenant's (Richard III. Act 1.  Scene 4th.). And here the sweet innocents Edward  VI and his brother the Duke of York fell victi- ms to the violent ambition of there remoseless  uncle." The Principal buildings are  the church, the white Tower, Governors House  the Bloody Tower, the Offices of Ordnance  of the keepers of the Records, the Jewel Office  the Hors Armoury, Queen Elizabeth's Armoury ENDENTRY the grand Store House in which is the Small  Arm Armoury, the train of Artillery, and the  tent room; the New Store House, wharein are  three Store Roomns's. Houses for the chief and infer- ior Officers. the Mess House for the Officers of  the Garrison, and the Barracks, for the Soldiers. In  addition to those there is a street called the Mint  which includes nearly one third part of the Tower.  The principal part of the houses were formerly in- habited by the Officers employed in the coinage, but now  principally by the Military, Government having erect- ed a vary extensive and majestic structure to the north  of Little Tower Hill, for the business of the Mint  department, with houses for those officers  The Grand Storehouse is north  of the white Tower, a fine building of brick and hewn  stones; it extends in length 345 feet, and is 60 feet  broad, it was commenced by James II and finished  by William III. On the first floor of this edifice  is that magnifficent room called the Small Armoury,  in which he, with Queen Mary his Consort, dined in  great state haveing all the warrent workmen and  labourers to attend them, dressed in white gloves and  aprons. THE HORSE ARMOURY. Here in one spacious room, 150 feet by 33 are  arranged in regular and chronological order, no less  a number than twenty two equestrian figures,  comprising many of the most celebrated kings of  England accompanied by their favorite Lords  and men of rank, all of them, together with their  horses in the armour of the respective periods when  they flourished, many, indeed, in the identical suits  in which they appeared while living. Along the  centre of the ceiling immediately over each figure  is a gothic arch in the centre of which is suspended  a banner which in gold letters on both sides, expres- ses the name, rank, and date of existence of the  personage represented. The horses stand, mounted  by their riders, almost without any visible supp- ort on a floor of brick raised a little from the adj- oining doarded flooring which is appropriated to the  spectators. 1. EDWARD. I. King of  England AD 1272. The armour of this figure consists  of the hawberk and its sleeves of mail, the hood and chau- sses of the same material. FIGURE This monarch is represent- ed in the act of sheathing his sword. 2 Henry VI.  King of England AD. 1450. This Plate armour is of the ENDENTRY most beautiful form, particularly the back  plate, which, like that of the breast is made  of Several pieces to be flexible. FIGURES the  Saddle of bone work is particular curious  3. Edward IV. King of England  AD. 1465. This is a complete suit of tournament  armour, finished with the additional pices termed  grand guard, volant-piece and gard-de-tras, FIGURES  4.th Henry VII. King of England  AD. 1508. This is a fluted suit of elegant form  probably of German manufacture  5. Henry VIII. King of England AD.  1520. This monarch appears in a suit of plate armour  gilt. FIGURE It is impossible to give a just summary of this  prince's qualities, he was so different from himse- lf in the several periods of his life. FIGURE In his youth  he was sincere, open, gallant, and liberal; in his more  advanced years, he became rapacious, arbitrary,  violent, superstitious, obstinate, unjust and cruel. He  had six wives. After he had been married 20 years  to the first, he grew weary of her, and from a pretended  scruple of conscience, put her away. His second  wife, the incomparable Queen Ann Boleyn, mother  of Queen Elizabeth, he beheaded upon slight  ground of jealousy. He was weary of the third as  soon as soon as he was married to her. The immature  death of the fourth, perhaps prevented an untimely one.  The fifth was beheaded as her predecessor Queen Anne was, though less innocent than Queen Ann of the  crime for which she suffered. The Sixth Queen  Catherine parr was a most religious lady, and was  so able a christian, that she had nearly disputed  her head off. Had the King lived a little longer he  would probably have made a new choice. But  he died Janury 28th1547, after a reign 37 years  and 9 months, and in the 56th years of his age  6. Charles Brandon. Duke of Suffolk  1520. He also Is represented in plate armour.  7. Edward Clinton Earl of Lincoln  AD 1535. This noblemans armour is vary elegantly  gilt. and his right hand rests on a mace. He w^e^ars a long  fluted sword. 8. Edward VI. King of England  AD 1552. This figure is particularly desierving of notice  both on account of its armour, which is what was  termed russet and gilt in the most curious manner  throughout and also for the fine Attitude in which  it is placed.
