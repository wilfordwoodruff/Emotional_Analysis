 Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference, on the  necessity for union, in faith and practice, among the Saints. When difficulties occur  they should be settled between the parties concerned or by the Teachers and not suffered to  go farther. We were engaged in a great work, but with the blessings of the Lord, we  could accomplish all that was required of us, if we were united. If our part  was faithfully performed here, we would, not only, have great satisfaction in re-  viewing our earthly career, but would be regarded by our dead friends as   their saviors

 But the gospel word condems them  Shows a meek & lowly way  Travelers few but Christ defends them  While they strive to watch & pray    Thes though few are bound for heaven  Self denying humble low  Knowing all their sins forgiven  Persecuted here below    Lord the number keep increasing  Though the beast may rage & war  And thy Kingdom without ceasing   Grow & spread from shore to shore    Hireling priests are sore tormented  for their craft in danger stands  Every plot has been invented  To uphold their popish plans 
 Elder  Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Conference, bear  testimony to the remarks of Elder Orson Pratt. He felt that if this  people did not repent, the judgements of the Lord were at their door  Both the living and the dead were looking to this people to do a  work for them and if the Saints neglected their duties their blood  would be answered upon the heads of this people.

I think as you do Pa   that it is a shame for our people to let  these matters of this kind stir them up   to such an extent. A great many people Pa  who are good Latter day Saints cannot understan[d]  how it is that the Apostles take part in   Politics. Not that these matters worry me  in the least for I am not a member of   either of them, I thank the Lord to say & think  that I shall take the stand of a nonpartisian  No one can deny but that both parties are   wrong. They both have something good & more   bad. Not that I wish to critisize any of our   apostles but politics and religion don't go well  together.

I have sold Propperty to go for, but  failed to get the means in time  for me to go now. I shall however  prepare to ^go^ in the fall, if you will  again specify the time.

 two men could leave the Political Areana and   continue their work in a church capasity without   unkind feelings towards one another. This may be   possible but I don't think so. It strikes me very   strongly that there must be enough for our   apostles to do to keep matters in the church   in running order without dabbling in the   "political Dish." You may have an object in   allowing these apostles to enter into Politic's & suppo[se]  with out a doubt you have or else you would  not allow it. Prehaps I had no business to remark  mention such a thing but it is my belief that   the people would honor you all the more if   you would forbid your apostles from taking   any hand in these matters. You will forgive  me I hope for saying any such thing and   my only reason for making such remarks is   that the matter is not entirely clear to me.  There are so many things I want to ask you   about in a religious way. I tell you Pa I will  know how to appreciate your company & blessed  counsel when I am with you again & if our   Lord permits us to live to see each other   again. Oh! then what joy will fill my heart &   I will know better how to appreciate my dear   Parents & good comfortable home.

 2  We are loosing many We have had  more sickness & Death in the past  year than any two years past  I had a cold on my Lungs so I  did not go to the tabernacle for 3  month so on the first of March my birth  Day it being Conference I concluded to  go to Meeting which I did do but I  got out of bed in the Morning sick &  went to the Meeting sick in great Distress  in my Stomach & bowels, sumthing like  the Billious Cholic. I staid in Meeting  one hour in great Distress & left with  Abram Cannon who got a Buggy  & carried me home & Emma & another  woman worked on me 12 hours till mid-  night before I got Relief & I came  near Dying I was confined to my  Home & bed most of the time for  8 days before I got able to go out  the first work I done was on  Monday I went to the Lake with M 
 your daily prayers to support me. Yesterday we   held a meeting here in our room & we   had quite a few straingers present and a good   many of them had to sit on the beds but   we did the best we could & had a good   meeting. I had been feeling a little blue (which   is not often the case.) After we had opene[d]  our meeting I took the stand though I felt that   it would be impossible for me to speak ten   minuets, but with the Lord's help I stood, my   hearers off for over an hour & when I looked  at my watch it was time to close so my   partner did not get a chance to say anything  but he shall have next Sunday. It should   be a testimony for a man when he feels  that he cant say a word & finds that   with the Lord's help he is able to interest  his congregation more than at times when   he feels more self reliant. Am real thankf[ul]  to say we are kept real busy & in my   work I find joy and happiness and no  matter how long it takes I mean to accomplis[h]   what I was sent hear to do. Pa has Bro.  Wilkin got Mat yet? I need the money if   he could see him but don't want you to   give him away. We are very short of missi[o]-  aries as I guess you are well aware.

Dear Brother: I am busy as ever and have not therefore time to   write a lengthy letter in reply to your favor of the 28th of July. I was very   pleased to hear from you, and that all was well with you. My health at present   is quite good. You are very fortunate in having plenty of water in that part of   the country. We are still suffering for the want of this necessary element.  We have had one or two slight showers of rain lately, but not enough to lay   the dust. The weather still continues very hot, and everything almost is burning   up. It is said that this is the hottest season ever known in Salt Lake. I   see that you also have had a share of it.    Our election passed off quietly. The result shows to us that the   People's Party in this City will have to be very wide awake and cast every vote   they have in order to save the city at the next election. Our people have been   rather careless and indifferent in the past in political matters. Now they   have got to arouse themselves and do all to their power to prevent our opponents   from gaining the ascendency.    Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have just returned from a trip   to Bear Lake Stake. We held conference there with the people, and had a very enjoyable   time. The people of that Stake have just erected a very fine tabernacle—about   the best in the Territory, outside of Salt Lake. We have also attended conferences

All send love. Alice often speaks of you and the family, as   does Emma. All wish to be remembered to you and your family. I am glad that you are   prospering in your wool business.

I have read it  with interest. I am always pleased to hear from you and your family.  I hope  you may enjoy health and the blessings of life.    Concerning myself, I have had some quite poor turns of  late, but I am in the enjoyment of fair health at present, though as busy as  ever.  Yesterday we kept the 4th of July by going up to Wasatch, in Little Cotton-  wood Canyon, the place where we have quarried and are quarrying the rock for  our temple.  Our brethren have built quite a little village there, composed  of tents and small cabins, and planted very nice flower gardens and walks, and  brought the water through the village.  We had a very interesting day.  There  were about thhree hundred persons present.  We had speeches and various enter-  tainments, and a feast.  We visited the stone quarry, which I was deeply inter-  ested in.  Rocks twice the size of your house are being split up into blocsks of  the finest granite in the world.  I was very much surprised to see their manner  of operation.  They drill holes in the side of a rock fifty feet high and drive in  little wedges which split it straight open, and they then cut it up into blocks.    I am glad that you are doing so well in your graein  harvest.  We are having a very dry time—the dryest ever known in this part of  Utah. Many of the crops will not mature.  We are approaching our harvest in

 A Revelation to Wilford Woodruff.  In the Wilderness, Jan. 26, 1880.    Thus saith the Lord unto my ser-  vant, Wilford Woodruff, I have heard thy  prayer and will answer thy petition. I  will make known unto thee my will concern-  ing the nations who encumber the land of  promise, and also concerning Zion and her  inhabitants. I have already revealed my  will concerning the nation through the mouth  of my servant Joseph, who sealed his testimony  with his own blood, which testimony has been  in force upon all the world from the hour of  his death. What I the Lord have revealed  in that testament and decreed upon the nation,  and upon all the nations of the earth, shall  be fulfilled, saith the Lord of hosts. I the  Lord have spoken and will be obeyed. My   purposes shall be fulfilled upon this nation,  and no power shall stay my hand. The   hour is at the door when my wrath and in-  dignation will be poured out upon the wick-  ed of the nations. Their murders, blas-  phemies, lyings, whoredoms, and abomina-  tions have come up before my face and  before the heavens, and the wrath of mine  indignation is full. I have decreed  plagues to go forth and waste mine ene- 
 this county.  We have a great many visitors in Utah from the East—Congressmen  and others.  I have a geat many callers, wishing interviews with me upon various  subjects.  We have a meeting to-day of the Twelve and the Presidents of Stakes.  Our enemies have great hopes of stealing our City and Territory.  How much  they will accomplish, time must determine.  We shall do the best we can, trusting  in God.  In consequence of this meeting, I must make this letter short.    Give my love to your family and to enquiring ofriends.

Let him who presides be mouth and kneel  upon the holy altar, and there let mine apostles  bring all these testimonies before my face and be-  fore the heavenly hosts and before the justified spirits  made perfect. And thus saith the Lord unto  you, mine apostles, when you bring these testimonies  before me, let them be presented by name as far as  the Spirit shall present them unto you—the presidents  of the United States, the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, the  Senate and House of the Congress of the United States,   the governors of the States and Territories, the judges  and others sent unto you, and all men and persons  who have taken any part in persecuting you, or bring-  ing distress upon you or your families, or who  have sought your lives, or sought to hinder you from  keeping my commandments, or from enjoying the   rights which the constitutional laws of the land guar-  iantee unto you.

 The ordinance of the Lord's supper being attended to, elder Woodruff rose to   state his motives for leaving England. His family were scattered; he had one   child in the State of Maine, and an aged father and mother in Connecticut, and   another child in Nauvoo, he could not think of the church leaving the United   States, and these portions remain ungathered. If Israel was justified in taking up   the bones of Joseph, surely he was so in taking his living father and mother and   children from the midst of Babylon. It was therefore a sense of duty which called   him away, and caused him to bid farewell to his friends in this land. It will of course   be necessary for this conference to take a vote on the presidency in Britain. My re-  turn is hastened, the work is hastened. It has ever seemed to me that the Lord has   driven me onward in his work. I have, comparatively speaking, been compelled to do   the work of five years in one. I have printed the book of Doctrine and Covenants   also the Proclamation, which would not certainly have been done, had not circum-  stances and the schemes of the enemy prompted it much sooner. I have visited   many conferences, but not so many as I could have wished. I have inquired of the   Lord respecting my departure, and I can come to no other conclusion than to adopt   this course. I feel now that the time has come, after travelling 60,000 miles, and   crossing the ocean three times, to go and gather with my brethren. There is   strength in Britain and in British laws. That day is past in America. I am an   American citizen and have a right to speak my sentiments; so long as you are pro-  tected by British laws, and are afforded equal rights with her other subjects, I say   respect those laws, and be subject unto them. I love the land of my birth, and   I love her laws, but not the mal-administration of them, for many of her rulers,   are guilty of great injustice towards the Saints, and the judgment of God hangs   over them. I hope then, that what I have stated will suffice in justification of my   leaving you. It will, therefore, in the first place, be my duty to adjust matters with   regard to the presidency, and I feel to recommend to your notice elder Reuben   Hedlock to preside over the church in Britain, which was unanimously carried.    Elder Woodruff also recommended elder Thomas Ward as his first counsellor,   which was also carried unanimously.    Elder Woodruff said he had another proposition to make with respect to another   counsellor. He had asked the Lord upon this subject, and he would nominate elder   John Banks to act as second counsellor unto the presidency, which was carried   unanimously.    Elder Woodruff remarked that we had been expecting elders who had received   their endowment to arrive in this country, but they now might not come, but pro-  bably go to the seed of Jacob in the West; but I trust there is sufficient wisdom and   talent here to carry on the work. It is for you to rise up as men of God, that your   course may be onward and increasing. Remember that the kingdom is rising in   the West, that their eyes will be upon you, and their ears to listen to the report of   your welfare. We have to lead the people there, and we have a great work to do.   I remember the words of our beloved prophet; on one occasion he said, "I have   one of the most important proclamations to make to you that God as yet given: as   soon as the elders get their endowments, they may go both through North and   South America, and build up stakes of Zion, as far as doors are open." We   now leave the temple and city, as a stake and a monument of the industry and   sacrifice of the Saints, at least until the indignation and judgments of God are past   over. Any nation acting as America has done, in withholding justice, in refusing   to defend her citizens from violence and death, will be punished, and is ripe for the   judgments of God; and rest assured, brethren, that the church in the wilderness will   look unto this portion of the church to assist and uphold them. 
 unto you, mine apostles, I also say unto my servants  the seventies, the high priests, the elders, the priests,  and all my servants who are pure in heart and who  have borne testimony unto the nations. Let them  go forth and cleanse their feet in pure water, and  bear testimony of it unto their Father who is in  heaven. And then, saith the Lord unto mine  apostles and mine elders, when ye do these things with  purity of heart, I the Lord will hear your prayer and  am bound by oath and covenant to defend you and  fight your battles. As I have said in a former  commandment, it is not my will that mine elders  should fight the battles of Zion, for I will fight your bat-  tles. Nevertheless, let no man be afraid to lay down  his life for my sake, for he that layeth down his life for  my sake shall find it again and have eternal life.   The nation is ripened in iniquity, and the cup of  the wrath of mine indignation is full, and I will not  stay my hand in judgments upon this nation, or the  nations of the earth. I have decreed wars and judge-  ments upon the wicked, and my wrath and indigna-  tion are about to be poured out upon them, and the  wicked and rebellious shall know that I am God.   As I the Lord have spoken, so will I fulfill. I will  spare none who remain in Babylon, but I will burn  them up, saith the Lord of hosts. As I the Lord

In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my  Official Seal, at my office, in U. T.,  the day and year in this Certificate first above mentioned. 
 Elder Woodruff then rose to lay his own individual case before the meeting.   Many inquiries had been made about emigration, and other things. I have a sub-  ject to lay before the meeting concerning my leaving. I wish to say that since I   have been in Liverpool, I have been engaged in publishing the Doctrine and Cove-  nants, and the Proclamation. The Hymn Book had been published before. I   cannot feel to leave without settling my accounts honourably; no one shall say that   we do not do justly with all men. We have on hand some 1500 Hymn Books,   some 700 or upwards Books of Mormon, and about 2000 Covenants. I have about   fifteen days to arrange matters in. By letter, received from Brigham Young, they   determine to deliver the entire people, who will number at least from fifteen to   twenty thousand souls. These have to be provided for with food for some twelve   months, waggons, &c., and means to travel, and it will be a mighty struggle to   deliver all the people, but they have determined to make the sacrifice. In Missouri,   when the edict went forth for the extermination of the Saints, multitudes sacri-  ficed all things, in order to assist each other. We want the Saints in Britain,   therefore, to assist us in this migration. The temple has yet to be finished, and   until the spring the tithing will be gathered, and I should be glad to take as much   with me as I can. Perhaps our friends may say, that there have been a many calls   for money, and so has it been in America, there has been a continual drain upon   the Saints, by the many vexatious lawsuits which they have had to meet, as well   as other things. The British Saints have come forward nobly, when called upon   to assist the brethren in the building of the Temple. Some £220 has been do-  nated since we called for assistance for the bell and clock; this is well, and I feel   convinced that you will continue your efforts. I should wish the Saints, during   the winter, to continue their exertions, when, afterwards, there will not be the   same call upon their benevolence. It will be evident to all, that with the quantity   of books on hand, that we should be glad to dispose of some of them, and the   authorities in Nauvoo wish us to procure all we can on these things, and if any   will loan money on the books, the presidency will refund the same, as soon as the   necessary bills thereon are discharged. I now call upon the Saints, in the name   of humanity, in the name of the Lord, and in the name of a suffering people, if   there are any that can assist to do it—if any can lend money on our books to do it,   not for any individual profit, but to assist in the great work that lies before us. And   again, if any wish to render me any personal assistance to enable me to carry my   family from the east to Nauvoo, to procure me a waggon and team, and necessaries   for the journey, it will be most gratefully received, and as a servant of God I   make this appeal, and leave it with you to act upon such measures as you think fit,   and God will help you according to the extent of your means and intentions in aid-  ing his great work. 
 Elder Woodruff then rose and said, that it was with no ordinary feelings that he   stood before them on the present occasion. He was labouring under severe indispo-  sition; the spirit was indeed willing, but the flesh was weak; he trusted, however,  that the assembly would be as still as possible, while he endeavoured to make a few  remarks. He had never seen any period of the church when his feelings were  more satisfied than at present, the veil was beginning to be withdrawn and present  scenes of glory and intelligence. Every hostile movement of the enemy at first  looked dark, but that darkness was quickly dispelled, and brighter scenes of truth  were speedily made manifest. The first news of the present movement certainly   was like a cloud passing over the mind, which however speedily vanished, and it will  eventually result in showing forth the power of God. We wish to lay before you  the causes of calling this conference. Our brethren and sisters, the Saints, after  being driven from their abodes, and hunted from Missouri, seemed as though they  had found a resting place in the state of Illinois; there, by their industry, they had  built up a large city and a temple, with several adjoining stakes; but the hand of  oppression and persecution is again upon them, and they are compelled, under the  alternative of death and destruction, to emigrate and seek an asylum in the wilder-  ness, beyond the Rocky Mountains. Some may suppose that the present removal  was a great trial—that is true, but the Saints were the people to endure that trial.  The time has come for Jacob to be the head and not the tail. Many have consi-  dered Nauvoo as the only settlement of the Saints, but the idea has been too limited.  Nauvoo has been a nursery, where the plants of the kingdom of God have been set;  but in the course of time those plants want spreading, in order that they may  arrive at full growth and proper maturity. And now when the Saints cannot  remain any longer, they are willing to go. This is also necessary in order that the  judgments of God might be poured out upon that guilty nation that is already  drunk with the blood of the Saints. The church must come out from the midst of  the Gentiles. Therefore we feel a satisfaction in this. We have built stakes, we  are willing to sacrifice and leave them. We have suffered our prophets to be mur-

And I say again, woe unto  that nation or house or people who seek to hinder  my people from obeying the patriarchal law of Abra-  ham, which leadeth to a celestial glory, which has  been revealed unto my Saints through the mouth  of my servant Joseph, for whosoever doeth these things  shall be damned, saith the Lord of hosts, and shall  be broken up, and wasted away from under heaven   by the judgments which I have sent forth and  which shall not return unto me void.

 PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO, AND HELPING THE LAMANITES.  OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL.    Remarks by Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, in the Bowery at Provo,  July 15, 1855.    REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.    I have sat and listened with a great  deal of interest to the teachings of   the Prophets and Apostles of the  Lord, and I feel it to be a privilege,  indeed, to enjoy the society of such  men, to hear them speak, and to have  a few moments with the rest to   address you. In the subjects and   items that have been presented before   us, there is a great amount of import-  ant matter. I have felt, and did in   the commencement of this Conference,  that for one man or several men to   have oil enough in their vessels to   supply one thousand men was a very  difficult thing, but it seems neces-  sary when a congregation comes  together for all to have oil in their  lamps, and not to require one or   half-a-dozen men to have oil with  them for the whole congregation.    Well, brethren and sisters, we have   heard a great deal since this meeting   commenced, on various subjects, and  we have had good teachings—prin-  ciples of eternal life have been set   before us by the several brethren who   have spoken. The proceedings of   this Conference have led my mind to   reflection. I have reflected upon what  I have heard, and considered the im-  portance of those teachings we have   received; and there is one thing I  want to say to this congregation,  when the servants of God who have   been set to lead us, or to lead the 
 THE DESERET NEWS. 379    REMARKS    On the death of Elder Ezra T. Benson, by  Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, de-  livered in the New Tabernacle, Salt  Lake City, Sept. 5th, 1869.    REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.    I am called upon this afternoon to make   some remarks upon the life and death of   Brother Ezra Taft Benson, who has been   suddenly taken out of our midst,—from time   into eternity.    I have long since considered it unneces-  sary to make any excuses for performing   my duty upon any occasion in public; but   if there is any position where a man might   have doubts about satisfying his own mind   or the minds of his friends, perhaps it is on   an occasion like this. It is well known, at   least to the Latter-day Saints, that the elders  of Israel rise to speak without any written   sermon or preparation of any kind. Many   of us have been engaged, the greater portion   of our lives, in preaching the gospel to the   world, and on every occasion we depend   for assistance and preparation upon the   spirit of God. This is my position this af-  ternoon. I rise before you with no prepared   sermon, and with no particular principles   that I have settled in my mind to address   you upon; depending, as on all occasions,   upon the spirit of God and the faith and   prayers of my friends. This dispen-  sation of Providence causes me many   reflections; and I presume it is the   case with every Latter-day Saint pres-  ent. In the first place I will ask the   question what position did Bro. Benson   occupy while in the flesh, and how many   have ever held the same position on the   face of the earth. The words contained in   the ##Isaiah 52:7|7th verse of the 52nd chapter## of the pro-  phecies of Isaiah are brought to my mind.   While contemplating the great work of   building up the Zion of God in the last   days he says:    "How beautiful upon the mountains are the   feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that   publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings   of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith   unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!"    What position can any man occupy on the   face of the earth that is more noble, God-  like, high and glorious than to be a messen-  ger of salvation unto the human family?   What more responsible position can a man   occupy than to be an Apostle of the Lord   Jesus Christ? I do not know of any in this   or any other generation. The thought also   arises in my mind how many individuals   have ever held this position on the earth?   I find in the history recorded in the Bible,   from the days of Adam down through the   different dispensations and generations,   that prophets have existed on the earth.   Adam, himself, was a prophet and he or-  dained his sons to the Melchizedec priest-  hood; the gospel of Christ was taught to him   after the Fall, and he attended to the or-  dinances of the house of God. He was a   high priest and, as a high priest, held the   keys of the Kingdom of God. There were   many sons who were High Priests, having   been ordained to this office by their father   Adam. Three years before his death he   called together Seth, Enos, Jared, Cainan,   Mahaleel, Methusaleh and many other of   his descendants in the Valley of Adam-Ondi-  Ahman, and there rose up and blessed them   with his great and last patriarchal blessing.   This has been given to us by revelation;   and these men were prophets and high   priests. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##]    Tracing down the sacred history through   the different ages and dispensations we   learn that many prophets existed among   the children of men. Moses was a law-  giver in Israel and held the office of a   prophet, seer and revelator. When I say   that many prophets have existed, it proba-  bly needs some qualification. The number   of persons thus honored of God has not   been many when compared with the whole   of the people who have lived; but in every   gospel age and dispensation God has had   His prophets and servants upon the earth   to make known His will to its inhabitants.   In the days of Moses elders were chosen,   as His counselors; and seventy elders were   ordained to bear record of the things of   God and to assist Moses in the work to be   performed in his day; but we do not read of   apostles being chosen under Moses's dis-  pensation. [##Numbers 11:16-17##] Jesus tabernacled in the flesh   to establish the Kingdom of His Father up-  on the earth, and when he was thirty years  of age he went forth administering in the  ordinances of the house of God, and he   chose twelve Apostles to assist him, and he   gave to them the keys of the Kingdom of   God. [##Matthew 10:1-4##] And the highest office that any man   has ever held on the face of the earth in this   or any other generation is that of an apos-  tle.  We read that God set in His church first,   apostles, then prophets, evangelists, pastors,   teachers, gifts, graces and helps; and the   office of an apostle entitles him to hold the   keys of the Kingdom of God; and what   he binds on earth is bound in heaven, and   what he looses on earth is loosed in heaven.   The history of the Twelve whom Jesus   chose is to be found in the New Testa-  ment; within the lids of that book their   travels, the course they pursued and   the doctrines they taught are published   to the world. Nearly the whole of them   sealed their testimony with their blood.   Some were crucified as their master was;   some were beheaded; and all except John   suffered martyrdom in some way for the   word of God and the testimony of Jesus   Christ. This was the fate of the first quor-  um of Apostles we have any history of.    After the death and resurrection of the   Savior, when he ministered to his disci-  ples the last time on earth, He informed   them that he had other sheep not of this   fold whom He was going to visit and min-  ister unto. [##John 10:16##] The Book of Mormon is a   record of the descendants of the House of   Israel who dwelt on this continent an-  ciently. It gives us the history of the Jar-  edites who came from the Tower of Babel;   of Lehi and his family, who came from Je-  rusalem and also of the Lamanites and Ne-  phites, the descendants of Nephi and Lem-  uel, sons of Lehi. In that record we find   that Christ, after His death and resurrec-  tion, visited that branch of the house of Is-  rael which dwelt on this continent. [##3 Nephi 11:1-17##] On the   occasion of that visit we are informed that   Jesus chose Twelve Apostles and gave to   them the same power, keys, gifts and gra-  ces that He had given to His apostles on   the eastern continent; and they went forth,   and magnified their callings. [##3 Nephi 12:1##] All of this   quorum of the Twelve Apostles had the   promise of departing and being with Christ   when they were seventy-two years old,   except three of them. To these three Jesus   gave a promise similar to that which He   gave to John the Revelator,—namely, that   they should tarry in the flesh until He   came. [##3 Nephi 28:4-12##] History informs us that the wicked   tried to kill John in various ways, placing   him on one occasion, in a cauldron of boil-  ing oil, but his life was preserved; and that   finally, in the reign of Domitian Caesar, he   was banished to the Isle of Patmos to work   in the lead mines. [##Revelation 1:9##] While there he was   blessed with visions, revelations, know-  ledge, light and truth, a portion of which we   have recorded in what are called the Reve-  lations of St. John. In the reign of Nerva   John was recalled, and afterwards wrote   his epistles. The first quorum of Apostles   were all put to death, except John, and we   are informed that he still remains on the   earth, though his body has doubtless un-  dergone some change. Three of the Ne-  phites, chosen here by the Lord Jesus as   His Apostles, had the same promise—that   they should not taste death until Christ   came, and they still remain on the earth   in the flesh. [##3 Nephi 28:4-12##]    Thus we have an account in the B[ible]  and Book of Mormon of but two quorums   of Twelve Apostles being chosen previous   to this dispensation; but in these last days   the Lord called upon Joseph Smith, gave   him power and authority to organize His   church and kingdom again upon the   earth and gave him the Holy Priesthood   and the keys of the kingdom of God. Jo-  seph was ordained to the apostleship under   the hands of men holding the keys of the   kingdom of God in the days of Jesus,—  namely, Peter, James and John. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##]    I shall not occupy time with entering   into the details of these things. I have re-  ferred to them to show the importance of   the office held by Brother Benson. He   was a member of one of the three quorums   of Apostles that have ever been chosen on   the face of the earth since Jesus Christ tab-  ernacled in the flesh, that we have any   knowledge of. The first chosen when Je-  sus commenced his public labors in the   flesh; the second after his resurrection,   here on this continent, and the third, since   the revelation of the gospel in our own day.   Here we find only thirty-six men, chosen   at various times and dispensations, in six   thousand years, to hold this order of Priest-  hoo, unless they were chosen in the days   of Enoch and at times in which the Bible   does not inform us. This number has been   increased, however, by others who have   been chosen to fill vacancies in these quo-  rums as in the case of Judas, and others;   but it is safe to say that the entire number   who have held this office from the days of   Adam until to-day has been very limited.   As to the number of inhabitants who have   dwelt on the earth during that period it is   a pretty difficult matter to form any correct   idea in relation to it; I do not think that   any statistician could tell this to any de-  gree of correctness. It is a kind of a given   point in these days to say that the popula-  tion of the earth is about a thousand mil-  lions, and that this number pass away   every generation. It is also estimated that about   three generations pass away in a century;   this gives three thousand millions in a cen-  tury, thirty thousand millions in a thousand   years, and one hundred and eighty thou-  sand millions in six thousand years,—  about the period that is supposed to have   elapsed since the creation of man upon the   earth. Whether these statistics are any-  thing like correct it is not of much impor-  tance to discuss; but it is an important re-  flection that Brother Benson, who has been   associated with us so many years, is one   of the chosen few, of all the immense num-  bers who have dwelt on the face of the   earth, who have been called to hold the   office of apostles. Well might the prophet   say, "How beautiful upon the mountains   are the feet," &c. [##Isaiah 52:7##]    I will say that in my boyhood while at-  tending Sabbath school in my native State,   Connecticut, there seemed something glo-  rious, to me, about the Apostles of Jesus   Christ who were called to preach the gos-  pel of the Son of God to the inhabitants of   the earth; and I have many times felt that   I would willingly walk a thousand miles to   see a prophet, an Apostle or any man called   of God, who could teach me the way to be   saved; a man who held in his hands the   power of the Priesthood, who could com-  mand the elements and they would obey   him, and who could declare the words of   life in their truth and purity to the inhab-  itants of the earth. I always looked upon   the lives and missions of these men, though   despised by the world generally, as the   most important of any men who ever dwelt   in the flesh. Jesus himself was called   master of the house of Beelzebub, and trav-  elled through a constant scene of poverty,   ridicule, persecution and affliction; yet   there was something great, good, grand   and glorious in the life of the Savior of the   world. This was the fate of Him and His   apostles; and though they descended below   all things they held in their hands the des-  tiny and salvation, not only of that genera-  tion but of all the human race; and woe be   to that house, nation, kindred, tongue or   people who rejected their words and testi-  mony, for they will rise in judgment against   them.    From the days of my childhood until I   heard the fulness of the gospel, as taught   by the Latter-day Saints, I had a great desire   to live to see a prophet or apostle. I have   lived to see this day. I have lived to see   the church and kingdom of God on the   earth, with all its gifts, graces, power,   glory and dominion, revealed and organ-  ized by the ministrations of angels from  God in heaven and by the revelations of   the Lord Jesus Christ. I have lived to see   apostles and the full organization of the   priesthood again officiating in and adminis-  tering the ordinances of salvation to the  children of men.    Brother Ezra T. Benson, whose death   has occurred so unexpectedly, was one of   the few called in this day to bear testimony   to the nations of the earth of the restoration   of this gospel, and he has traveled many   thousand miles to do so. He has been   true and faithful unto death, and he will   receive a crown of life. He has gone from   our midst to the spirit world to mingle with   the Gods, or at least with his brethren who   have gone before him; whether he will   mingle with the Gods until after the resur-  rection perhaps it is not for me to say. He   has gone home to receive his reward. What   a cloud of reflection it brings to the mind!   It speaks in loud language to every apostle,

 dered without resistance, and in no case has resistance been offered, save according  to law and at the command thereof. We are by no means discouraged, we look  upon these things as the fulfilment of the word of the Lord. Next spring will  present such a scene as has not been witnessed scarcely since the exodus of the  Israelites from the land of Egypt. I am perfectly willing that these things should  be, and that America should have the credit of banishing so many of her citizens  from her midst for conscience' sake. There is no safety under the government of  the United States. It is time to go where we can enjoy our rights, and no longer  be hemmed in, but be placed where Jacob's nobles shall be of themselves, and their  governors shall proceed from the midst of them.—##Jeremiah 30:21|Jer. xxx. 21##. I rejoice, then,  more than at any other time. Let America go ahead with her present measures,  but let the Saints arise and go out of her midst. If we are called to make  sacrifices, the Saints are the people that can make them. 
 testimony.    Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF bore  testimony to the remarks already  made. The Lord raised up this work,  through the Prophet Joseph Smith,  who labored for its establishment  and predicted many things, all of  which thus far have been fulfilled,  and there is no doubting the fact  that all that remains will be in due  time. I have witnessed the progress  of this work for many years, and   have gone through the trials and ex-  periences of early times, and when  I see this people to-day numbering a  hundred and fifty thousand, I see  the hand of God among them, I   feel interested in the youth, because  I look to them to bear off this work  in triumph. Many of the older au-  thorities have passed away. Joseph  is gone, Brigham is gone, and others  are following. When I think of the  hardships they and many of us have  passed through, traveling without  purse of scrip—shouldering our  knapsacks, leaving families and  friends for the truth's sake, I some-  times am led to exclaim, Where  oh God, are the children of the pro-  phets, who have the stamina to  shoulder the responsibility of the  kingdom, and bear it off as their  fathers have done. Yet they are  here, before and around me in the  rising generation. To them it will  be given and God will preserve among  them those that will sustain his work.   I want to see the young men and   women instructed aright. We are   responsible for this, and should do  all in our power to train them in the   principles of righteousness. I would  like to see the name of every young   man in Israel enrolled in the Young  Men's Associations, and every young  lady a member of their Associations,  that they may all be gaining intelli-  gence and learning of the things of  God. I hope they will heed the  counsels of their elders and avoid  temptation. This people were or-  dained before they were born to  come forth in this generation and do  the work they are doing. I would  rather not live another hour than to  live so long that I should lose the  fellowship of the Saints of God, or  be estranged from the spirit of our  religion. I have an anxiety about  these associations. They are doing  a good work in preparing young men  for the field that is before them. I  was never called to perform a mis-  sion in my life but what I was glad  of it, after I got through, no matter  what the circumstances were before  going or while I was away. We  have adopted some general instruc-  tions to the Associations, which   Brother Junius F. Wells will now  read. 
 times, concerning my Church which has been called out  of the wilderness of darkness and error, concerning  the Zion and kingdom of God, and concerning Babylon  the Great, and what I have spoken through the mouth  of my servant Joseph, shall all be fulfilled. And  though heaven and earth pass away, my words shall  not pass away, but shall be fulfilled, saith the Lord.    These revelations and testimonies are before  you. Let my Saints search the word of the Lord,   and treasure up wisdom, and be prepared for that   which is to come. As I have decreed, so shall  my judgments begin at the house of God. There  are those in my church who have a name among  you, who are adulterers and adulteresses, and those  who blaspheme my name, and those who love and  make a lie, and those who revel and drink with the  drunken. If they do not speedily repent of this  wickedness and abomination, they should be severed  from the ordinances of my house, saith the Lord.  There are many who have need to repent, whose lusts ^hearts^  are set upon the things of this world, who aspire to  the honors of men, and do not honor the priesthood,  nor seek to build up the kingdom of God, as they should.  Neither do they learn and comprehend that the rights  of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the  powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven can 
 DISCOURSE  By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,  delivered in the Tabernacle, Salt  Lake City, Dec. 12th, 1869.    REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS    The few of us who met here this forenoon  had the privilege of listening to a very  interesting discourse from Bro. Penrose,   on the first principles of the gospel. I say  the "few" who were here, for there were   few, and there are every Sabbath in the fore  part of the day. I think if the Latter-day  Saints prized their privileges as they ought  to do, there would be more attend meeting  on a Sunday morning, there would be more  of us faithful to the Lord our God and to  the covenants we have made if we did but  realize the rewards that, in the future, will  be awarded for the deeds done here in the   flesh.    There was one principle referred to by  Bro. Penrose this morning, upon which I  wish to make a few remarks, for the benefit  of the Elders of Israel. It is a very common  saying with us, as Elders, in our remarks  concerning the gifts of the gospel to speak of  confirming the gifts of the Holy Ghost by  the laying on of hands. There is no differ-  ence with regard to our faith, opinions or  views, as a Church, pertaining to this   principle; it is only in the manner in which  we use our language. There is a difference   between the gifts of the Holy Ghost and   the Holy Ghost itself. As Brother Penrose   said this morning, we repent of our sins, are  baptized for the remission of them and we  receive the laying on of hands for the   reception of the Holy Ghost; but the elders,   when speaking on this principle, instead   of saying so, not unfrequently say "for the  reception of the gifts of the Holy Ghost."   Now we have no right, power nor authority  to seal the gifts of the Holy Ghost upon   anybody, they are the property of the Holy  Ghost itself. To explain this I will say, for  instance, Prest. Young may go and preach  in every ward in this city; yet it is President   Young in each ward. When in the 14th   Ward he may give a man an apple; in the  13th Ward he may give another person a   loaf of bread; in the 10th Ward he may give  a man a dollar in money; in the 1st Ward   he may give a man a horse and carriage.  Now they are all different gifts, but he is  one and the same man who bestows them.  I merely bring up this figure by way of  illustration.    We lay hands upon the heads of those  who embrace the gospel and we say unto  them, "In the name of the Lord Jesus  Christ receive ye the Holy Ghost." We   seal this blessing upon the heads of the  children of men, just as Jesus and His   Apostles and the servants of God have done  in every age when preaching the gospel of   Christ. But the gifts of the Holy Ghost are  His property to bestow as he sees fit. To  one is given the spirit of prophecy, to   another a tongue, to another the interpreta-  tion of tongues and to another the gift of   healing. All these gifts are by the same  spirit, but all are the gifts of the Holy  Ghost, to bestow as He sees fit, as the  messenger of the Father and the Son to the  children of men.    The Holy Ghost, as was justly presented  this morning, is different from the common  spirit of God, which we are told lighteth   every man that cometh into the world. The  Holy Ghost is only given to men through  their obedience to the Gospel of Christ; and 
 Before the close of this conference  there is a subject upon which I wish to  bear my testimony. There were per-  haps very few people here yesterday  who are in this assembly today, when  Brother Thatcher delivered a lecture  upon the life of President Brigham   Young. He referred to a saying of   President Young which I, being a wit-  ness of, feel it my duty to allude to. I  am the first person unto whom he made  the remark, and the only one living in  the flesh who was with him and Joseph  Smith, the Prophet of God, when he   gave to the Twelve Apostles their charge  concerning the Priesthood and the keys  of the Kingdom of God; and as I myself  shall soon pass away like other men, I  want to leave my testimony to these  Latter-day Saints.    I was sitting with Brigham Young in    *Remarks by President Wilford Woodruff at  the Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, Sunday, June  2nd, 1889. 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,    Delivered at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday Afternoon,  July 20, 1883.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    OBJECT OF MEETING TOGETHER—OUR DEPENDENCE UPON THE SPIRIT  OF THE LORD—CERTAIN RIGHTS WHICH BELONG TO ALL MANKIND  —UNPOPULARITY OF GOD'S SERVANTS IN ALL AGES OF THE WORLD  —A MAN MUST BE BORN AGAIN BEFORE HE CAN UNDERSTAND  THE THINGS OF GOD—THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-  DAY SAINTS—THE GOSPEL THE SAME IN ALL DISPENSATIONS—HOW  THE GOSPEL WAS RESTORED—THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—  UTAH BUILT UP BY THE POWER OF GOD—JOSEPH SMITH RECEIVED  ALL THE KEYS OF THE PRIESTHOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF  ANGLES—FULFILLMENT OF REVELATION—THE PRIESTHOOD—PLURAL  MARRIAGE.    WE meet here upon the Sabbath  day for the purpose of partaking of  the sacrament, the emblems of the  Lord's body and blood which were   broken and shed for us, and also to  give and receive instruction as we   may be led by the Spirit of God.    It is well known to the Latter-  day Saints—though perhaps not to  strangers—that no Elder or member   of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints who enters into  this Tabernacle knows who is going  to be called upon to speak to the  people. Hence no man spends a   week, a day, an hour, or a mo-  ment to prepare a discourse to  deliver unto the people. We are  all of us dependent upon the Spirit  of the Lord, upon revelation,  upon inspiration, upon the Holy  Ghost, in order to be qualified to  teach the people before whom we  are called to speak, and if the Lord   does not give me the Holy Spirit   this afternoon, I promise you all  you will not get much out of Brother  Woodruff, whether they be Saints or  strangers. I have never seen  a day since I have been a member  of this Church, that I have felt   that any man was qualified to teach   saint or sinner, Jew or Gentile, the   inhabitants of the earth abroad or at  home, only as he was moved upon   by the power of God. I have never   believed any man was qualified   from the days of Father Adam to  our day to go forth among the in-  habitants of the earth with the  declaration of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ, in a way and manner to con-  vince them or teach them the Gospel  in its truth and purity, and in the  power of God, only by inspiration.   I have never believed that any man  was qualified in any age of the world   to build up the kingdom of God,  or do the will of God only upon  that principle. And I have 
 people of God in all the word, when   they rise up to testify, and when they   stand forth to teach the Saints, and  to present principles before them   that are calculated to save them if   adhered to, I wish the Saints to  understand that those teachings, or  those precepts have to be received by  us as a people, for they will prove a  savor of life unto life or death unto   death.    I thought of the children of Israel   this morning. Now, says Moses to   them, I have set life and death before  you, choose which you will receive,  and it is just so with us, the way  of life is pointed out and if we  neglect to walk therein, there is  nothing but death stares us in the   face. [##Deuteronomy 30:19##] Let us stop and reflect a   moment—let us see whether it is best   for us to receive life or death.   Brethren, you have heard plain truths,  and they have been dictated by the  power of the Holy Ghost and   by the testimony of Jesus Christ,  and now is the time for you to  decide whom ye will serve. When  I used to hear the Prophet Joseph,  and when I hear Brigham, or  Heber, or Jedediah M. Grant, or  the Twelve Apostles, or any other   men, if they speak by the spirit and  power of God, and they tell us thus  saith the Lord, so and so will come   to pass, for instance those who will   feed and clothe these Lamanites and  see to their wants, as our President  has told us, they shall be blessed and   prosper, while those who despise   them shall go down and shall not  stand in the kingdom of God, I   believe that what they say will be  fulfilled. I also believe that which  was said here to-day, viz.: That we  do forget what we are, and we often   forget who we are; we forget, as a  people in these mountains, by what  hand we have been led here, and by   whom we have been governed and   controled since this kingdom has been   organized and the holy Priesthood   committed to man upon the earth.  We become so overcome by the cares  of life that we neglect and forget  our duties, and as the brethren have  remarked with reference to our   brethren and sisters in this place,  they do not realize the responsibility   that rests upon us. Do we realize   the salvation that is to be given to  this people? If we did we would  prize our privileges far more than we   do at the present time. How many of   us who are now in this congregation rea-  lize as we ought the salvation and the   privileges which are granted to us?  Do you appreciate the Priesthood that  is given you, and that the keys of the  kingdom are given to you, and that  the world of mankind are dependent  upon you for salvation? No, not as  you ought. We forget our God and   our prayers, we forget to call upon  God for his Holy Spirit to rest upon  us, that we may live to his honour   and glory. Truly, if the Elders in   this Church and kingdom realized   what is put into their possession, and   that the God of heaven will actually   require an account of our stewardship,  an account of what we have been   doing, and what use we have been  making of the gifts and blessings  which he has bestowed upon us, we   should be more diligent in the per-  formance of all our duties, and we   should often act differently to what   we do, and pursue a different course,   and especially concerning our red   brethren. And I will say to you  brethren who reside in Provo, for  God's sake listen to counsel, and for  the sake of the house of Israel, and  for your own sake listen to the in-  structions of President Young and  carry them into practice. Do not go  away from this stand and let those  things escape your minds, and be   like water spilled upon the ground   which cannot be gathered again, but  receive them as the revelations of 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  addressed the assemblage as follows:    I feel very thankful that my life  has been preserved to attend another   semi-annual conference of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. I hope and trust that  while we are together our hearts   may be lifted in prayer to God, and  that we may enjoy His Holy Spirit   and the revelations of heaven; that   what may be said while we are as-  sembled together during our confer-  ence may be according to the mind  of God.    I feel that, of all people under   heaven, we have the greatest reason   to rejoice before the Lord that we   have lived in a day and generation   when the God of Israel has set His   hand to establish His Kingdom, to   gather together His people, to build   up Zion, to carry out the great pur-  poses which the Lord has promised   and given by revelation through the   mouths of inspired men—Prophets,   Patriarchs and Apostles—since the   world began. I rejoice in the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ; I always have   since I have been made acquainted  with it.    It has been my lot and privilege   to be associated with the Latter-day   Saints for over fifty years. I have   seen the afflictions, the tribulations,  the persecutions through which this  people have been called to pass from   their organization until the present   day. But we have everything to   encourage us as the Saints of God,  as those who have entered into cove-  nant with Him, obeyed His com-  mandments, and walked in the ordi-  nances of His house. The Lord has   never in any dispensation or gen-  eration failed to carry out His   purposes and His works; and of all   the generations and dispensations   that God has given to men, this last  and great dispensation—the greatest   of all dispensations—has been re-  vealed to the human family.    The Kingdom has been revealed,   the Church of Jesus Christ has been   organized, the Zion of God has been   inaugurated, the people of God have   been called together; and in all the   troubles and trials through which   we, as a people, have been called to  pass, there has been no power that   has stayed the hand of God or   thwarted His purposes with regard  to the carrying out of His principles  or those which have been revealed   unto the Latter-day Saints.    The Lord has called—commenc-  ing with Joseph Smith, the Prophet   of God—Apostles and Prophets,   Patriarchs and Elders, High Priests   and Seventies in these last days to  go forth and warn the world. We  have been under the necessity of   doing this. As the Lord told Ez-  ekiel, He sent him as a watchman   unto the House of Israel; He told   him what the consequences would  be if he did not fulfil his mission   and do his duty--that the blood of that   generation of the House of Israel   would be required at his hands. So   the God of heaven ordained when  He raised up Joseph Smith the Pro-  phet to organize this Church and   Kingdom. He stood as a watchman   on the walls of Zion unto this gene-  ration. There are 30,000 people, I   suppose, today dwelling in these   hills of Israel who hold some por-  tion of the Holy Priesthood. It is   our duty to warn the world; we have  been called to do this; we would have  been under condemnation if we had  not fulfilled that duty; and so the   Church and Kingdom of God have   grown until the present day.    With regard to our future, it is in   the hands of God, who holds the  destiny of this people and of all   men in His own hands. I would   say to the Latter-day Saints. Fear   not; lay your burdens upon the   Lord, and He will not fail us. He   will not fail in carrying out all His  purposes and all His promises unto   us. The Zion of God will arise, and   so will the glory and power of God,   and we shall be prepared as a bride  for the coming of the bridegroom.    Let our hearts be raised to God   while we are assembled together in   this Conference, that we may have   His Holy Spirit with us continually. 
 not be controlled nor handled, only upon the prin-  ciples of righteousness. Such should repent and  turn unto the Lord, and seek for the Holy Spirit  to guide them. Judgments will begin upon  my house, and from thence will they go forth unto  the world, and the wicked cannot escape. Bles  sed are the pure in heart, for my blessings  await them in this life, and eternal life in the  world to come.    Thus saith the Lord unto you, my servants  the apostles, who dwell in the flesh, Fear ye not  your enemies. Let not your hearts be troubled. I  am in your midst. I am your advocate with  the Father. I have given mine angels charge  concerning you. Mine eyes are upon you,  and the eyes of your heavenly Father and the  heavenly hosts and all justified spirits made perfect  are watching over you. Your works are manifest  before the faces of my servants who have sealed their  testimony with their blood, and before all my ser-  vants of the Twelve Apostles whom I have taken  unto myself. The vail is taken from off their  faces and they know your works. They await   your coming when you have finished your  testimony in the flesh. Therefore, be ye faith-  ful until I come. My coming is at the door[.] 
 the depot in the city of Boston at the  time when the two Prophets were mar-  tyred. Of course we had no telegraphs  and no fast reports as we have today to  give communication over the land. Dur-  ing that period Brother Young was wait-  ing there for a train of cars to go to  Peterborough. Whilst sitting there we  were overshadowed by a cloud of dark-  ness and gloom as great as I ever wit-  nessed in my life under almost any cir-  cumstances in which we were placed.  Neither of us knew or understood the  cause until after the report of the death  of the Prophets was manifested to us.   Brother Brigham left; I remained in  Boston and next day took passage for  Fox Islands, a place I had visited some   years before, and baptized numbers of  people and organized branches upon  both those islands. My father in-law,  Ezra Carter, carried me on a wagon  from Scarborough to Portland. I there  engaged passage on board of a steamer.   I had just put my trunk on board and was  just bidding my father-in-law farewell,  when a man came out from a shop—a  shoemaker—holding a newspaper in  his hand. He said, "Father Carter,  Joseph and Hyrum Smith have been  martyred—they have been murdered in  Carthage jail!"    As soon as I looked at the paper the  Spirit said to me that it was true. I had  no time for consultation, the steamer's   bell was ringing, so I stepped on board   and took my trunk back to land. As I   drew it off, the plank was drawn in. I  told Father Carter to drive me back to  Scarborough. I there took the car for  Boston, and arrived at that place on the   Saturday night.    On my arrival there I received a letter   which had been sent from Nauvoo, giv-  ing us an account of the killing of the   Prophets. I was the only man in Bos-  ton of the quorum of the Twelve.    I had very strange feelings, as I have  no doubt all the Saints had. I attended  a meeting on the following day in Boyd-  ston's Hall, where a vast number of the  inhabitants of Boston and some three  hundred Latter day Saints had assem-  bled. Hundreds of men came to that  meeting to see what the "Mormons"   were going to do now that their Proph-  ets were dead. I felt braced up; every  nerve, bone and sinew within me seemed  as though made of steel. I did not shed  a tear. I went into that hall, though I  knew not what I was going to say to that   vast audience. I opened the Bible pro-  miscuously and opened to the words of   St. John where he saw under the altar  the souls of them that were slain for the  word of God, and heard them cry, "How  long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou  not judge and avenge our blood on  them that dwell on the earth?" The  Lord informed them that they must wait   a little season, until their brethren were  slain as they were. I spoke on those   words.    Next day I met Brigham Young in the  streets of Boston, he having just re-  turned, opposite into Sister Voce's house.  We reached out our hands, but neither  of us was able to speak a word. We  walked into Sister Voce's house. We  each took a seat and veiled our faces.   We were so overwhelmed with grief and  our faces were soon bathed in a flood of   tears. I felt then that I could talk, though  I could not do so before—that is, to  Brother Brigham. After we had done  weeping we began to converse together  concerning the death of the Prophets. In  the course of the conversation, he smote  his hand upon his thigh and said,  "Thank God, the keys of the Kingdom  are here." Brother Thatcher referred  to that yesterday.    All that President Young or myself, or   any member of the Quorum need have  done in the matter was to have referred  to the last instructions at the last meet-  ing we had with the Prophet Joseph be-  fore starting on our mission. I have al-  luded to that meeting many times in my  life.    The Prophet Joseph I am now satis-  fied had a thorough presentiment that  that was the last meeting we would hold  together here in the flesh. We had had  our endowments; we had had all the  blessings sealed upon our heads that  were ever given to the Apostles or  Prophets on the face of the earth. On 
 CONFERENCE.    A Large Attendance and a Good Spirit  Prevailed.    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF PRESENT.    Synopsis of the Addresses Made During  the Conference.    The regular quarterly Conference  convened as announced at 10 a.m.  last Sunday morning. The people  were delighted to notice the pres-  ence of President Woodruff. Of the  Apostles F. D. Richards, Moses  Thatcher and M. W. Merrill were  present:    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  arose and said:    I feel thankful to have the privi-  lege again of meeting with the  Latter-day Saints in this comfort-  able building here in Logan.    When I look upon our situation,   and the position we occupy, and   the scenes that we are called to   pass through, I can only acknowl-  edge myself the hand of God in   the preservation of my own life and   the lives of my brethren and sisters   until the present time. We have   passed through rather a peculiar  season. We have had a good deal   of sickness. We have had more   deaths from it the past year   than in any two years since we   have been in these valleys, especi-  ally among the aged; and there   is hardly any of us who has been   able to escape the pestilence or   sickness, or whatever you may call   it, that has passed over the country.    We have had very many sudden  deaths in Salt Lake and other por-  tions of the Territory. Men have   passed away with a very few mom-  ent's sickness.    I have not been able to attend   any public meetings during last   winter for some three months. I   attended two or three funerals   when called. But I thought on my   birthday, the first of March, I rose   in the morning sick, I went to   meeting sick; and while there I   had to leave and go home. Eight   days I was confined to my house   and bed a good deal of the time.    My counselor, Brother Smith, has   been very sick with the same ill-  ness. Brother Cannon has also   been afflicted and it was not   deemed wise for him to attend this   conference. Several of the twelve   have also passed through more or   less of this sickness. Well, while   some of our brethren and friends   have died in a few hours warning,  our lives have been preserved. I   attribute this in a measure to the   faith and prayers of the Latter-  day Saints. I would say that I   feel this myself. If there is any-  thing that will humble a man be-  fore the Lord it is to live in the  hearts of the Latter-day Saints and   need their prayers.    I will say that I have been a   marvel and a wonder. The saints   that I have been associated with in   former days in Kirtland and   Nauvoo and from the organization   of the church have been called   away while my life has been pre-  served for what purpose the Lord   knows; I do not.  But I acknowl-  edge the hand of God in these   things. We are here upon a mis-  sion. We have a responsibility   resting upon us as leaders of the   people and as elders of Israel and   as Latter-day Saints in every capa-  city in which we are called to act,   both male and female.    We are passing through a rather   peculiar portion of our history and   I am the same to-day as I ever have   been since I have been a member   of the church in my faith, feelings   and belief. I know that we have   been called and we have been pre-  served as a people and as the house   of Israel through the loins of Abra-  ham, Isaac and Jacob; and many   have been called in the latter days   to stand in the midst of the earth   to prune the vineyard once more   for the last time, to labor as ser-  vants of God, as instruments in   the hands of God, for laying the   foundation of the great work of the   last dispensation of the fullness of  time. This is our mission. It has   been our fortune to stand in the   midst of the generation. We have   been raised up in the midst of a   generation to labor in this great   cause to warn the world once more   for the last time, to prune the vine-  yard for the last time before   the coming of the Son of Man and   our numbers are very few as has   been the case in every age and gen-  eration of man when God has raised   up a people to perform his work in   the midst of the inhabitants of the   earth. Their numbers have been   few, and I was going to say, a hiss   and a byword, in a measure, among   all generations of men when there   has been a people of God.    The Lord Himself has been a   very unpopular being upon the face   of the earth. Since Lucifer has had   power among the children of men,  Jesus Christ has been one of the   most unpopular men that dwelt  in the flesh in His day and genera-  tion; and He had the hatred and   the persecution, and the oppression,   and the opposition of His own   father's house, that is, of the Jewish   nation. He came unto His own  and His own received Him not.  The Savior Himself labored but a   short time among the Jews, but He   labored long enough to organize a   church.  He labored long enough   to choose apostles and seventies and   to raise up a number of disciples  who received His teachings and   followed Him. All of them were   called, especially the apostles--  those who were leaders in the   church. They were called to sacri-  fice their lives. Every one of the   apostles was persecuted and sacri-  ficed or put to death in some way   except John the Revelator, the only   one preserved by the power of God.   You see this the case throughout   the world in all dispensations, and   we ourselves are no exception to  these truths. Joseph Smith himself   from the time that he received the   plates containing the history of the   Book of Mormon, the stick of   Joseph in the hands of Ephriam   which was to be put in the Bible,   the stick of Judah, in the last days  as instruments to gather together   the children of God and the house   of Israel.    This church has now been organ-  ized over sixty years and its his-  tory is before us, its history is be-  fore the world; but certainly all the   saints of God, all men and women   who have received a testimony for   themselves are to clearly under-  stand that the work that has been   performed here on the earth should   strengthen their faith. For if there   is any generation of the children   of men in the world that has had   cause to rejoice it is the Latter-day   Saints. But we have not been with-  out our warfare and persecution,   not without occupying a position   where our enemies have been en-  gaged against us.    The Elders should have their   quorums organized, and the   quorums of the teachers, deacons   and priests should magnify their   callings. The priesthood is the   gift of God to man. I am anxious   that our brethren should not rush   forward for some higher office until   they magnify the office they al-  ready hold. When a class of men   and women have the blessings   of the priesthood, their prayers will   have power before the Lord. Now   we have all these organizations of   the sisters in Relief Societies and   other capacities, and all these in-  stitutions have been organized of   God. I am going to say good-bye   and God bless you. There has been  excellent council given here.  Here   is the element that the Lord has   prepared for the building up of   His kingdom. God bless you.    Amen.

 every man who receives that spirit has a   comforter within—a leader and guide to  dictate him. This spirit reveals, day by   day, to every man who has faith, those  things which are for his benefit. As Job   said, "there is a spirit in man and the in-  spiration of the Almighty giveth it under-  standing." [##Job 32:8##] It is this inspiration of God to  His children in every age of the world that   is one of the necessary gifts to sustain man   and enable him to walk by faith, and to go  forth and obey all the dictations and com-  mandments and revelations which God  gives to His children to guide and direct   them in life.    We have a long list given to us in the  New Testament scriptures of those, who, in  ancient days, lived, labored and performed  their duties by faith. Among them was   Noah, who, being warned of God, went forth  and prepared an ark for the salvation of   himself and family. Abraham, also, offered  up his son Isaac by faith, because he was   called and commanded of God, believing in  the promises God had made unto him. [##Genesis 22:1-19##]    This gift and principle of faith is neces-  sary for the Saints in every age of the world  to enable them to build up the kingdom of  God and perform the work required of   them. All that the ancients did was by  faith. Jesus and His apostles often quoted  the prophecies of the ancient prophets and  showed that they were fulfilling them.  Even the labors of Jesus, from the manger   to the cross, through his whole life of pain,  sorrow, affliction, suffering, persecution  and derision, were all by faith. It was by   the power of the Father, whose work He  had come to perform, that He was sustain-  ed. He fully believed that He would be  able to accomplish all that He had been sent   to perform. It was on this principle that   He fulfilled every requirement and obeyed  every law, even that of baptism, when He  was immersed in the Jordan by John, who  held the Aaronic priesthood and the keys   of baptism for the remission of sins. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] Bap-  tism was a righteous law; in fact, it was the  law of God to save the children of men,   and Jesus was the door, and He, although  free from sin and guile, complied with it as   an ensample to His disciples and the rest of   the children of men.    The Apostles, in their labors, had to work  on the same principle that the Saints in  both former and latter days have had to  work upon—namely the principle of faith.  Joseph Smith had to work by faith. It is  true that he had a knowledge of a great   many things, as the Saints in former days  had, but in many things he had to exer-  cise faith. He believed He was fulfilling  the prophecies of the ancient prophets. He  knew that God had called him, but in the   establishment [o]f His kingdom He had to   work continually by faith. The church   was organized on the 6th of April, 1830,  with six members, but Joseph had faith  that the kingdom thus commenced, like a  grain of mustard seed, would become a   great church and kingdom upon the earth;   and from that day until the day on which  he sealed his testimony with his blood, his  whole life was as if wading through the   deep waters of persecution and oppression,  received from the hands of his fellowmen.  He had all this to endure through faith, and   he was true, faithful and valiant in the   testimony of Jesus to the day of his death.    All the labors that we have performed  from that day until the present have been   by faith, and we, as Latter-day Saints,  should seek to cherish and grow in this   principle, that we may have faith in every  revelation and promise and in every word  of the Lord, that has been given in the   Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine and   Covenants, for they will surely come to  pass as the Lord God lives, for the unbelief  of this generation will not make the truths  of God without effect.    When the members of Zion's Camp were   called, many of us had never beheld each  other's faces; we were strangers to each  other and many had never seen the   prophet. We had been scattered abroad,  like corn sifted in a seive, throughout the  nation. We were young men, and were   called upon in that early day to go up and   redeem Zion, and what we had to do we had   to do by faith. We assembled together  from the various States at Kirtland and   went up to redeem Zion, in fulfilment   of the commandment of God unto us.   God accepted our works as He did   the works of Abraham. We accomplished  a great deal, though apostates and unbe-  lievers many times asked the question  "what have you done?" We gained an ex-  perience that we never could have gained  on any other way. We had the privilege  of beholding the face of the prophet, and  we had the privilege of travelling a thousand   miles with him, and seeing the workings   of the spirit of God with him, and the rev-  elations of Jesus Christ unto him and   the fulfilment of those revelations. And  he gathered some two hundred Elders from  throughout the nation in that early day and  sent us broadcast into the world to preach  the gospel of Jesus Christ. Had I not gone  up with Zion's Camp I should not have  been here to-day, and I presume that  would have been the case with many others  in this Territory. By going there we were  thrust into the vineyard to preach the gos-  pel, and the Lord accepted our labors. And  in all our labors and persecutions, with our  lives often at stake, we have had to work   and live by faith.    The Twelve Apostles were called by rev-  elation to go to Far West, Caldwell   County, to lay the foundation of the corner   stone of the Temple. When that revela-  tion was given this Church was in peace  in Missouri. It is the only revelation that  has ever been given since the organization   of the Church, that I know anything about,   that had day and date given with it. The  Lord called the Twelve Apostles, while in  this state of prosperity, on the 26th day of  April, 1838 to go to Far West to lay the  corner stone of the Temple; and from there  to take their departure to England to preach  the gospel. Previous to the arrival of that   period the whole Church was driven out of   the State of Missouri, and it was as much   as a man's life was worth to be found in the  State if it was known that he was a Latter-  day Saint; and especially was this the case  with the Twelve. When the time came for   the Corner stone of the Temple to be laid,   as directed in the revelation, the Church   was in Illinois, having been expelled from   Missouri by an edict from the Governor.  Joseph and Hyrum Smith and Parley P.   Pratt were in chains in Missouri for the  testimony of Jesus. As the time drew nigh   for the accomplishment of this work, the  question arose, "What is to be done?" Here  is a revelation commanding the Twelve to   be in Far West on the 26th day of April, to  lay the Corner stone of the Temple there; it   had to be fulfilled. The Missourians had   sworn by all the Gods of eternity that if   every other revelation was given through Jo-  seph Smith were fulfilled, that should not  be, for the day and date being given they  declared that it should fail. The general   feeling in the Church, so far as I know,   was that, under the circumstances it was  impossible to accomplish the work; and   the Lord would accept the will for the deed.  This was the feeling of Father Smith, the  father of the Prophet. Joseph was not with   us, he was in chains in Missouri, for his re-  ligion. When President Young asked the   question of the Twelve, "Brethren, what   will you do about this?" The reply was:  "The Lord has spoken and it is for us to  obey." We felt that the Lord God had given  en the commandment and we had faith to  go forward and accomplish it, feeling that  it was His business whether we lived or died   in its accomplishment. We started for Mis-  souri. There were two wagons. I had one   and took Brother Pratt and President  Young in mine; Brother Cutler, one of the   building committee, had the other. We   reached Far West and laid the Corner stone   according to the revelation that had been  given to us. We cut off apostates and   those who had sworn away the lives of  the brethren. We ordained Darwin Chase   and Norman Shearer into the Seventies.   Brother George A. Smith and myself were  ordained into the quorum of the Twelve on  the Corner stone of the Temple; we had been  called before but not ordained. We then  returned, nobody having molested or made  us afraid. We performed that work by  faith, and the Lord blessed us in doing it.  The devil, however, tried to kill us, for   before we started for England everyone of   the Twelve was taken sick, and it was  about as much as we could do to move or  stir. I had traveled in Tennessee, Missis-  sippi, Kentucky and Arkansas for two or  three years, and that too, during the sickly  season, where they were not well enough  to take care of the sick, and I had never had  the ague. But upon this occasion I was  taken with the ague, the first time in my  life. All the Twelve had something the  matter with them. But we had to travel  sick; we had to travel by faith in order to  fulfil the mission to which we had been   called by revelation. But the Lord sus-  tained us, He did not forsake us.  We went  to England, and we baptized, in the year   1840, something like seven thousand peo-  ple, and established churches in almost all  the principal cities of the kingdom. Bro.  Pratt established a branch in Edinburgh,   Scotland. Brother Kimball, George A. and  myself built up a branch in London, and sev-  [eral] branches in the south of England. We   baptized 1,800 persons in the south of Eng-  land in seven months; out in that number  two hundred were preachers belonging to   different denominations of that land. We  opened an emigration office, published the  book of Mormon and gathered many to  Zion. God, was with us, and I may say  that he has been in all the labors of this   Church and Kingdom.    In the pioneer journey,  coming here, we   had to come by faith; we knew nothing  about this country, but we intended  to come to the mountains; Joseph had  organized a company to come here, before   his death. He had these things before him,  and understood them perfectly. God had  revealed to him the future of this Church  and Kingdom, and had told him, from time  to time, that the work of which he was lay-  ing the foundation would become an ever-  lasting kingdom—would remain forever.   President Young led the pioneers to this   country. He had faith to believe that the  Lord would sustain us. All who travelled  hither at that time had this faith. The   spirit of God was with us, the Holy Ghost  was with us; and the angels of the Lord  were with us and we were blessed. All,  and more than we anticipated, in coming   here, has been realized, as far as time would   permit.    When the Mormon Battalion was called  for by the United States, we were in our   exile, having been driven from our homes,  our country and graves of our fathers, from  lands we had bought of the United States   Government, for our religion, into the wil-  derness. The Government made a demand  upon us for five hundred men to go to the   Mexican war. I do not suppose that they  expected we would furnish them, but we   did, and we did it by faith. Five hundred   men, the strength of Israel, were sent to   fight the battles of their country, leaving  their wives, children and teams on the   prairie. They had to exercise faith, and so  had we who remained, believing it would  turn out for the best, and it has proved so.   Every member of that Battalion who has   remained faithful has always rejoiced, from  that day to this, that he was a member  thereof. It has proved a blessing to him,   and it proved salvation to Zion.    I have referred to these things to show   that hitherto, in our labors to build up the   Church and Kingdom of God upon the  earth, we have had to labor by faith. It is   still requisite. God has called upon us to  warn this generation. He has set His hand  to establish Zion—the great Zion of God—  about which the prophets have said so   much. No prophet has spoken more  pointedly on this subject than Isaiah. Our   drivings from Missouri, our persecutions,  our travels along the Platte River, the man-  ner of our coming to the mountains of Israel,   our return again to the land of Zion and  the building of the temple in Jackson  County have all been spoken of by Isaiah  as well as by all the prophets who have  spoken concerning the Zion of the latter  days.    We have exercised faith in the carrying  out of these promises and in the fulfilling  of those revelations of God unto us. We  have walked and lived by faith, precisely  the same as the apostles, prophets and saints  have done in every dispensation and age   of the world; for there is one remarkable  feature with regard to the work of God, and   that is, it has always been unpopular in   every age and generation. The Lord has  never sent a message to the inhabitants of  the earth but what it has been despised,  in a great measure, by most of them  As it was in the days of Noah and   Lot, so shall it be in the days of the  coming of the Son of Man. [##Matthew 24:37##] In the days of  Noah there were eight souls saved, after  one hundred and twenty years' labor in   preaching and building the Ark. [##Genesis 7:1-7##] In the  days of Lot but very few left the city of   Sodom. Lot and his family left, and we  are told that his wife was turned into a pillar  of salt; and what the angels had told Lot   concerning Sodom and Gomorrah came to  pass—fire and brimstone were sent down  from heaven upon them and they were   destroyed. [##Genesis 19:24-29##]    The work of God and the Gospel of Christ   have always been unpopular. Take the life   of the Savior himself. There is a fair ex-  ample. Trace Him from the day he was  born until His death, and who were His  friends. A few illiterate fishermen. Jesus   Christ came to the house of Judah and they  rejected him; and Jerusalem, Judea, and  the inhabitants of all the region round about  rose up against Him with the exception of  a few poor men and women. Still He was   the Savior of the world, the great Shiloh of  Israel, the great King of the Jews. That is   a fair ensample of the way in which the   work of God has been received in every   age and dispensation. All that Jesus said  concerning the Jews has come to pass to the  very letter; not one jot or tittle has fallen   unfulfilled. Their history for the last eigh-  teen hundred years, until the present day,  has been a remarkable ensign to the nations  of the earth of the truth of the Bible and of  the truth of the testimony of Jesus Christ,   and of Him being the Savior of the   world. All that He said concerning them  and all that Moses predicted concerning  their dispersion and about their being   driven, as corn is sifted through a seive,  among the nations; about the manner in  which their women did evil to the children  of their own bosoms when Jerusalem was  surrounded by the Roman army, when it  was taken and over two millions of its in-  habitants were destroyed by sword,   pestilence and famine, has been fulfill-  ed. [##Amos 9:9##] All these things have been in strict  fulfilment of the sayings of Moses and  Jesus concerning them. When the Sa-  vior was sentenced to death, they cried  "Let his blood be upon us and upon   our children;" and they have been trampled  under foot by the whole Gentile world for   the last eighteen hundred years. [##Matthew 27:21-25##] In their   affliction and persecutions they have had to  suffer almost beyond the endurance of   man, and until the last few years, have  scarcely had the right of citizenship in any  nation under heaven—except in the United  States. All that has been spoken concern-  ing them has had its fulfilment as fast as  time would admit.    It is so with regard to the gospel of Jesus  Christ in the latter days. If they called the   master of the house Beelzebub, will they  not say the same of his household? They   said that he cast out devils by Beelzebub,  the prince of devils, they said he was a   pestilent fellow and a stirrer-up of sedition   and strife, still -- he was the Savior of the  world. [##Matthew 10:25##]    This principle of unbelief has existed  in every age; it exists to-day. The elders  of Israel have had to contend with this   power of darkness, with persecution, op-  pression, ridicule and opposition from those  who should have received their message—  a message which was for the good and sal-  vation of those who rejected it. The Jews  should have received the testimony of   Christ, but as a nation they rejected it. Our  experience has been very similar to that of   Jesus and His apostles. We have had to  labor by faith. We have had to exercise   faith in the revelations that have been given  to us in the Book of Doctrine and Cov-  enantsand Book of Mormon, as well as in  the Bible. These revelations pourtray what  lies before us as a people. The fate of this  nation and the nations of the earth has been  pourtrayed by the ancient prophets in the  Book of Mormon and Bible. Isaiah has  told us what will come to pass in the latter  days concerning those who fight against  Mount Zion and against the children of  Zion. Every weapon will be broken, every  nation that will not serve Zion shall be  utterly wasted away saith the Lord; for the  Lord will fight in defence of the land of   Zion. He will establish the kingdom that   Daniel saw, in fact that kingdom has been  established; the Zion of God has been set  up, the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints has been established by  revelation from Jesus Christ in our day and  generation; and we are called to build it up,   we are called to perform its work. As I   have often remarked, the Gods, the Angels,   the whole heavens, all the good men, all  the spirits of the just that dwell in the   eternal world are watching with vast in-  terest the labors of this people.    They are not perfect without us, we are  not perfect without them. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:15##] There is no  period in the whole history of the world,  no dispensation of God to man, that is   fraugh with such interest as the dispensa-  tion in which we live; there never has been.   No prophets, no apostles or inspired men  in any age of the world ever had the priv-  ilege of laying the foundation of the Zion   of God to remain on the earth to be thrown  down no more for ever. In every other dis-  pensation of the world the people have risen  up against God and His Christ, against the  kingdom and against the priesthood, and  have overthrown the messengers of heaven,  and put to death every man who has borne   the kingdom of God, and the kingdom has  been taken from the earth. This is true of   every age except that of Enoch. He built  up a kingdom and gathered together the  people after laboring and preaching three  hundred and sixty-five years. He per-  fected a city, which was called the city of   the Zion of God. But behold and lo, the na-  tions of the earth awoke and found that Zion  had fled! The Lord took it to Himself; took   it away from the earth. The people were   righteous; they had become sanctified and  the Lord took them away out of the power   of the wicked. Zion could not remain on   the earth; there was not power sufficient to  withstand the assaults of the wicked; or if  there was, the time had not come when the  Lord would make use of the children of   men; or there were not enough of the chil-  dren of men willing to take hold and man-  ifest those principles in their lives so that  that they could remain on the earth.   But in the latter days He will do so. He  has sworn it by Himself, because there is  none greater to swear by. He has declared  it through the mouth of every prophet that   has ever lived on the earth, whose writings  we possess, both in the Bible and Book of   Mormon, as well as in those glorious reve-  lations in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants given through the mouth of Joseph  Smith the prophet. These sayings are true.   We as a people should exercise faith in  them, no matter what may be transpiring   in the outside world. We have had the   powers of wicked men and devils to con-  tend with. We may say that the devil is  mad; he is stirred up against Zion: he   knows that his reign will last but a little  season longer.    This arch enemy of God and man, called  the devil, the "Son of the Morning," who  dwells here on the earth, is a personage   of great power; he has great influence and  knowledge. He understands that if this  kingdom, which He rebelled against in  Heaven, prevails on the earth, there will be  no dominion here for him. He has great   influence over the children of men; he la-  bors continually to destroy them. He la-  bored to destroy them in Heaven; he la-  bored to destroy the works of God in   Heaven, and he had to be cast out. He is   here, mighty among the children of men.  There is a vast number of fallen spirits,   cast out with him, here on the earth. They  do not die and disappear; they have not   bodies only as they enter the tabernacles  of men. They have not organized bodies,   and are not to be seen with the sight of the  eye. But there are many evil spirits   amongst us, and they labor to overthrow  the Church and kingdom of God. There  never was a prophet in any age of the world   but what the devil was continually at his  elbow. This was the case with Jesus Him-  self. The devil followed him continually  trying to draw Him from His purposes and  to prevent Him carrying out the great work   of God. You see this manifested when he  took Jesus on to the loftiest pinnacle of the   temple and showed Him all the glory of  the world, telling him that he would give  Hm all this if H would fall down and   worship him. The poor devil did not own a  foot of land nor anything else! The earth  was made by and belonged to the Lord   and was His footstool. Yet the devil of-  fered that to Jesus which was not his own.  Jesus said unto Him, "Get thee behind me  Satan." [##Matthew 16:23##]    This same character was with the disci-  ples as well as with their master. He is   with the Latter-day Saints; and he or his  emissaries are with all men trying to lead   them astray. He rules in the hearts of the  inhabitants of the earth. They are gov-  erned and guided by him far more than  by the power of God. This is strange, still  it is true. See the wickedness in the world.  See the abominations with which the earth  is deluged, causing it to groan under the  burden. Where does this evil come from?   From the works of the devil. Everything  that leads to good is from God, while every  thing that leads to evil is from the devil.   Here are the two powers. How many on 
 that occasion the Prophet Joseph rose  up and said to us, "Brethren, I have de-  sired to live to see this temple built. I  shall never live to see it, but you will. I   have sealed upon your heads all the keys  of the Kingdom of God. I have sealed  upon you every key, power, principle  that the God of heaven has revealed to  me or sealed upon me. Now, no matter  where I may go or what I may do, the  Kingdom rests upon you."    Now don't you wonder why we, as   Apostles, could not have understood  that the Prophet of God was going to be   taken from us? But we did not under-  stand it. The Apostles in the days of  Jesus Christ could not understand what  the Savior meant when He told them "I  am going away; if I do not go away the   Comforter will not come!" Neither did  we understand what Joseph meant.  "But," he said, after having done this,  "ye Apostles of the Lamb of God, my  brethren, upon your shoulders this   Kingdom rests; now you have got to  round up your shoulders and bear off  this Kingdom." And he also made this  very strange remark, "If you do not do  it you will be damned."    I am the last man living who heard  that declaration. He told the truth, too;  for would not any of the men who have  held the keys of the Kingdom of God or  an Apostleship in this Church have been  under condemnation, and would not the  wrath of God have rested upon them if  they had deserted these principles or de-  nied and turned from them and under-  taken to serve themselves instead of the  work of the Lord which was committed  to their hands?    When the Lord gave the keys of the   Kingdom of God, the keys of the Mel-  chisedeck Priesthood, of the Apostle-  ship, and sealed them upon the head of  Joseph Smith, He sealed them upon his   head to stay here upon the earth until  the coming of the Son of Man. Well  might Brigham Young say, "The keys  of the Kingdom of God are here." They  were with him to the day of his death.  They then rested upon the head of   another man—President John Taylor.   He held those keys to the hours of his  death. They then fell by turn, or in the  providence of God, upon Wilford Wood-  ruff.    I say to the Latter-day Saints the keys  of the Kingdom of God are here, and  they are going to stay here, too, until  the coming of the Son of Man. Let all  Israel understand that. They may not  rest upon my head but a short time, but  they will then rest on the head of an-  other Apostle, and another after him,  and so continue until the coming of the  Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven  to "reward every man according to the  deeds done in the body."    I want to add another thing, because   I feel it my duty to say it to the Latter-  day Saints. There is a feeling—it was  so in the days of Joseph Smith—that he  was not the man to lead the Church.   Even his bosom friends, men with whom  he saw the angels of God, Oliver Cow-  dery and others, considered him a fallen   Prophet and thought they ought to lead  the Church. This history is before you  and before the world. The same feeling  was manifest in the days of Brigham  Young when he was called to hold the  keys of the Presidency of the Church.   There were other men who thought they  should be appointed to that office. But  the God of heaven manifested to you,  and to me, and to all men, who were in  Nauvoo, upon whom the mantle had   fallen. Brigham Young took his place,  and led the Church and Kingdom of  God up to the day of his death.    There are men today, there will be  men till the coming of the Son of Man,  I expect, who feel as though they ought  to lead the Church, as though it is not  going on right—that this, that, and the  other is wrong. I say to all Israel at this  day, I say to the whole world, that the  God of Israel, who organized this  Church and Kingdom, never ordained  any President or Presidency to lead it  astray. Hear it, ye Israel, no man who  has ever breathed the breath of life can  hold these keys of the Kingdom of God  and lead the people astray.    We talk of revelation. There has  been a feeling of wonder many times as  to why Brigham Young did not have 
 THE TABERNACLE.    BIRTHDAY  ANNIVERSARY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF AND EMMA S. WOODRUFF    You are cordially invited to attend a  RECEPTION  to celebrate the  Ninetieth Anniversary of my Birthday,  and the  Fifty-ninth of that of my wife, Emma,  to be held in  The Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,  Monday, March 1st, 1897  at 10 o'clock, a. m.    Wilford Woodruff 
 Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer. Ask and  you shall receive. Whenever you agree as touching  anything, and ask the Father in my name, it  shall be given unto you. Seek diligently to  build up Zion, and to magnify your high cal-  ling, and your enemies shall not prevail over  you. Zion shall not be moved out of her place.   Zion shall prevail against her enemies. My  people shall not be hindered in the building of  my temples unto my holy name, if they will  hearken unto my voice and do as I command  them.    The blood of my servants Joseph and Hy-  rum, and of mine apostles and elders, which  has been shed for the word of God and the testimo-  ny of Jesus Christ, cries from the ground for ven-  geance upon the nation which has shed their  blood. But their blood shall speedily be  avenged, and shall cease to cry unto me, for the  hour of God's judgment is fully come and shall  be poured out without measure upon the wicked.  But hearken and hear, O ye apostles, elders, and  people of my church, to the word of the Lord con-  cerning you, that for all the blessing that I will  pour out upon you and the inhabitants of  Zion, and the judgment and destruction 
 Jesus Christ to us. It has been   remarked that it costs a great deal  to keep the Lamanites, and who does  not know that everything costs a   a good deal in this kingdom? Have   you not tithed your whole substance,  your flocks and herds and all your  possessions? Have not the Gentiles   robbed you and spoiled you of every  thing you possessed? and have you  not had to make your beds in the  mud upon the banks of the Missis-  sippi river. You have experienced  all this and a great deal more. Does it  require the same to pay your Tithing?   Does it require the same affliction, the  same suffering to keep the command-  ments of God, as it did in those days of  persecution and trial? No, it does  not. Will it cost as much to farm   for them, to feed and clothe them, as  it cost us in those times of trouble  and perplexity? All will acknow-  ledge that it is better to give a part  than to lose the whole, and have to  flee to the rocks and mountains, and  be driven from our homes by the   Gentile world. You will find, brethren  and sisters, that the trials will be  heavier and more severe every time,   and you will also find, that when the   duties of our calling are light upon us,  it will be then that we will require to   be stirred up to diligence and to the   performance of our duty. The people  are always the best when they are   busily engaged. When I have heard  brother Kimball declare, that if this  people did not save their wheat and   the necessaries of life they would see   hard times and famine in the land.   I say these things sink like lead into  my feelings, and they always did  from the very first that I heard them.   Whenever I hear things set forth by  the servants of God, I always know  that there is a meaning to them, and  they always weigh heavily upon my  mind. The Lord foreshows us   through his servants what is coming   to pass, and in this way we have   been led by the hand of God; and it   has been by his mercies that we  have been guided until the present  time. The blessings of God have been   multiplied upon our heads year after  year, and we have had more than we   deserve bestowed upon us, and the   counsel and instructions given us have  been good. I hope that we will be  wise, and not let those things pass   away as idle tales, but follow them up   and be on hand for every thing that  is required at our hands. I hope that  brother Snow will lead up in these   matters, respecting your meeting-  house and farming operations for the  natives, and I hope that they will  carry out the instructions given them,   and if the brethren will attend to  these things and do them in faith and   in the name of the Lord, I will tell  you how it will be, all you take in   hand will prosper, the Lord will bless   your crops, and your cattle, and all  that you possess. But if you neglect   your labour this year, why next year   your labours will be double; and so it  will be year after year until all your   blessings will be taken away, and you   will be left to yourselves. Then do   what is required at your hands, and   your yoke will be easy and your  burden light, because you will do each  day that which belongs to that day.    I know that what has been said  here is true, and the Spirit bears   record to you and to every honest  heart—to every man and woman,  that these things are correct. These   Lamanites have a right to the holy   Priesthood, and it is our duty to carry  the Gospel unto them that they   may attain to all its privileges and   blessings.    We have for the last twenty years  been preaching it in the United States,  in Europe, and distant nations of the   earth, and thousands have embraced  it; but in accomplishing this the   Elders of Israel have had to make all   kinds of sacrifices, and be absent from 
 felt, both while abroad in the world,  as well as at home, that when called  upon to teach the Latter-day Saints   or anybody else—I have felt as   though my lips ought to be touched   with a live coal from off the altar,  and my heart filled with inspiration  from Almighty God. When I   think upon the day and age in  when we live, when I think upon   this day and dispensation in which   the God of heaven has set His hand  to carry out the fulfillment of the  mighty prophecies contained within  the lids of the Bible, the Old and  New Testaments, the stick of Judah,  I realize that in order to comprehend   these things a man must be in pos-  session of the Spirit of the  Lord day by day. In the words of  the Savior as recorded in St. John's  Gospel, "This is eternal life, that   they might know thee, the only   true God, and Jesus Christ whom   thou has sent.    I say many things when I am   called upon to speak in the presence   of strangers that I do not confine  myself to when addressing the   Saints, because the latter are ac-  quainted with our principles, while  the former are not.    As Latter-day Saints we respect  the rights of all men. We believe   that all mankind, men and women,  in this and every other dispensation  and generation, have certain rights;  that God has created all men with  an agency, I care not in what king-  dom, empire, republic or place they   dwell. They have a right to enjoy   their religion. They have a right   to worship God according to the  dictates of their own consciences.  "But," says one, "do you mean that  in empires where an emperor   holds the rights and destinies of his  subjects in his hands?" Yes. I  mean there is no emperor who   breathes the breath of life who has  the right to deprive one of his sub-  jects of the freedom of his religion.  I will tell you why. No emperor,   no king, no president, no ruler of  any nation under the heavens has  ever given his subjects life. Their   life has come from God, and God   has granted them their agency and  the right to worship Him according  to the light and knowledge they   have. This is the view entertained  by the Latter-day Saints. And I  have heard Joseph Smith say that  if he were emperor of the whole   world, holding the destinies of all  men in his hands, he would defend  the religious rights of every man,   whether his religion was right or   wrong. And especially ought this   to be the case in this American na-  tion, the constitution of which guar-  antees to all people the right to wor-  ship God according to the dictates   of their own conscience. This is the  broad platform upon which our   government has been founded. I  have looked upon the Constitution  of the United States as one of the   best instruments ever devised by   man for the government of the in-  habitants of the earth. I look upon  it as such to-day. And while we  are willing to allow the Methodists,  the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the  Catholics, and every sect under heav-  en, the right to enjoy their religion   undisturbed, yet we claim the same  privilege as a people, as a church, as  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, and hence, in expressing  myself here this afternoon with   regard to the Gospel of Jesus Christ,  or the kingdom of God, if I differ  from any of this congregation, I   have a right to differ; the congrega-  tion has a right to differ from me;   and no man has a right to say, Why  do you so? The destinies of the   whole human family are in the hands   of God. I shall be held accountable

 revelation, why John Taylor did not  have revelation, why Wilford Woodruff  does not have revelation, why any other  Apostle does not have revelation. I hold  in my hand a book of revelations, enough  to lead this Church into the celestial  kingdom of God. Anybody who will  obey that law will have all the revela-  tion that he can fulfill on the earth. We   are not without revelation. The heavens   are full of it, so is the holy Priesthood.    I know the destiny of this people; it   is revealed by the God of Israel and left  on record. I know the destiny of this  kingdom, and I want to say, let us try to  unite together and fulfill the law of God.   You need not trouble about the king-  dom God has established. He will take  care of it. The same God who has or-  ganized this Zion and gathered one  hundred and fifty thousand people here  from the nations of the earth, has His   eye over you, He is watching over you,  and He will take care of you when you  do your duty. Zion is not going to be  moved out of her place. The Lord will  plead with her strong ones, and if she  sins He will chastise her until she is  purified before the Lord.    I do not pretend to tell how much sor-  row you or I are going to meet with be-  fore the coming of the Son of Man. That  will depend upon our conduct.    With regard to the keys of the King-  kom of God, they were placed on the  earth to remain, and they will remain   until Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of  heaven. But I and other men, the Apos-  tles, and all who are called to officiate in  the name of the Lord need the faith and  prayers of the Latter-day Saints.    By way of closing I will say that Brig-  ham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Wood-  ruff, these Twelve Apostles around me,  and everyone of the Seventies, High  Priests, High Councilors, Presidents of  Stakes, the Melchisedec and all the  Aaronic Priesthood, and all the Latter-  day Saints—all will get what they labor  for. Whatsoever we sow, whether good  or evil, of that we will reap the fruit.    But in the morning of the resurrection  you will find Joseph Smith holding the  keys of this kingdom and dispensation  at the head of all Israel who belong to  this dispensation; he will hold them to   the endless ages of eternity, notwith-  standing that we shall all get our reward  for what we do. The keys of the king-  dom were given to Joseph Smith. They  were placed on the heads of other men  to make use of on earth for a short time;  and when we get through we shall all  have our reward.    Let us make up our minds to serve   and honor God. Do not have any fears  concerning the kingdom; the Lord will  lead that aright; and if Brother Wood-  ruff or any of the Presidency of this   Church should take any course to lead  you astray, the Lord will remove us out  of the way. We are in the hands of the  Lord and those keys will be held and  taken care of by the God of Israel until  He comes whose right it is to reign.    God bless you all. Amen.    -[At the evening session President  Woodruff made the following additional  remarks:]-    Before dismissing this assembly I feel  it my duty to say a few words. I ad-  dressed the Saints a short time this  afternoon upon a certain subject, and   that was in bearing my testimony to the  keys of the kingdom of God, which the  Lord gave to Joseph Smith, and the   retaining of those keys upon the earth  through their bestowal upon the heads  of the Apostles. I did not pretend to  dwell upon the organization of the  Priesthood or of the Church in these   remarks. My only object was to bear  my testimony upon that subject. After  the meeting I began to reflect, from re-  marks which I made, that perhaps many  of the people might get an entirely   wrong idea of my views with regard to  the kingom of God. I referred to the  Doctrine and Covenants—a code of re-  velations which the Lord gave to Joseph  Smith. This book contains some of the  most glorious revelations upon doctrine,  upon principle, upon government, upon  the kingdom of God and the different  glories, and upon a great many things   which reach into the eternal worlds.  My leaving this subject there, perhaps,  might lead my friends to suppose that I 
 380 THE DESERET NEWS. -[Sept. 15    prophet, elder and saint of God, and to   all the inhabitants of the earth, "Be ye also   ready!" That is what it says to all men.   If you have anything to do, any work to   perform that is of consequence to yourself   or friends, living or dead, do it.    Is there any sorrow or mourning in my   heart with regard to the departure of   Brother Benson? I would rather follow a   thousand aostles and prophets to the grave  and see their lifeless remains deposited in   the dark and silent tomb, than see one man   who has tasted the good word of God, and   the powers of the world to come make   shipwreck of his faith, lose his crown and   go to perdition. I have had more sorrow   in seeing men, with whom I have traveled   and preached the Gospel, turn from the   truth, commit wickedness and lose their   standing in the Church, than over all the   faithful Latter-day Saints I have seen laid   in the tomb. When I see a man depart   who, like Brother Benson, has been ever   willing to go and come and do the bidding   of those over him, I look forward with   great joy to his reward. He is the first   man in the Quorum of the Twelve, who, for   the last forty years, has had the privilege of   dying a natural death; for most of the   apostles who ever tabernacled in the flesh   have died as martyrs. We have had two in   our quorum who have died thus, besides   our prophet and patriarch. True, they will   receive a martyr's crown, so will all men   who are true and faithful unto death and   lay down their lives for the work of God   and the testimony of Jesus Christ.    Brother Benson has died among his   friends; he had not been in pain or suffering,   or endured a lingering sickness. Thank God   he died in the harness and has gone home   to receive his reward. During the time he   has been a member of the Church he has   been on many missions. I will here re-  mark, without entering into details, that  at the time the Saints were driven from   Illinois to this land, he was called upon   and sent east, as one of the agents of the   church to prove the eastern country,—our   Puritan fathers and friends in New Eng-  land, after we had been driven from our   homes, country, and the graves of parents,   wives and children, to see if they would   stretch out their hand to assist us while in   the wilderness. He labored faithfully on   that mission, visiting Boston and other   leading New England cities, calling for   contributions to help the poor, the widow   and the fatherless, who were, in a measure,   in a state of starvation in the wilderness   after having been driven from their homes  in the midst of an inclement winter. I be-  lieve he got fifty dollars. If he had gone   into Missouri and split rails by the day I   guess he would have made considerable   more money in the same time. But never   mind! He was faithful on his mission, and   returned faithful, and continued so from   the commencement of his career as a Lat-  ter-day Saint until the day of his death.   I rejoice in this, and it is a consolation to   his family, and to all Israel to know   that he has been true and faithful to   his calling. When I contemplate and rea-  lize that the little time spent here in this   mortal life will fix and mould our destiny   for all the endless ages of eternity I try to   realize what manner of men we all ought   to be.    I have traveled a good deal with Brother   Benson and have been acquainted with   him, as you have, a good many years past,   and I can bear this testimony of him,—he   has always been ready and willing to la-  bor in either temporal or spiritual things.   Here on this road he labored faithfully   during the past year in building a hun-  dred miles of the railroad; he and those   associated with him finished their job with   punctuality. All these things show the   untiring industry and perseverance of the   man.    This is the way with all of us. We are   all called to labor in temporal and spiritual   things in building up the kingdom of God   in these last days. We have to preach the   gospel to the children of men; we have to   warn the nations of the earth. We have   been called to do this; this is the command   of God to the Elders of Israel. In obedience   to this they shoulder their knapsacks and   without purse or scrip, travel the world   over to declare to the children of men the   words of life and salvation. In doing this   they swim rivers, wade swamps and en-  dure much toil and privation. During the   last thirty-seven years of my life I haye tra-  veled one hundred thousand miles in   obedience to this command. It will be well   with all men who are faithful in the per-  formance of these duties. Brother Benson   never performed a mission or any other   duty but what he will rejoice over forever,   and so it will be with us all. The reward   of the faithful will amply repay them for   all the labors they ever performed or for   the privations they have endured. No la-  bor we have ever done that has helped to   promote the happiness and well-being of   our fellowmen will go unrewarded. Bro-  ther Benson, to-day, instead of being with   his family in Logan, that is in the flesh, he   may be with them in spirit, is privileged   to mingle with his brethren who have   gone before,—Joseph, Hyrum, David, Par-  ley, Heber and the prophets and apostles   of former days. He is mingling with   them. They have finished their work in   the flesh. So has he. He has been suddenly   called away from his labors but his works   will follow him.    I wish to speak to my friends a little,   with regard to the position which we occu-  py as Elders of Israel, and as the church and   kingdom of God upon the earth. I feel im-  pressed to do so. I do not know that I wish   to say a great deal more with regard to   Brother Benson. His labors are before us   and the world, and they are before God and   angels. I am satisfied with them and I do   not know who is not who was acquainted   with him. I wish, now, to say something   with regard to the organization of this   Church and the position occupied by Joseph   Smith, Elder Benson and the Apostles and   priesthood of this Church.    We are living in a very important age, an   age in which preparations are making for   the second coming of the Messiah to reign   a thousand years upon the earth with His   Saints. The Scriptures of the Old and New   Testament will never be fulfilled until this   comes to pass. An angel of God, the Reve-  lator John informs us, was to fly through   the midst of heaven, having the everlasting   gospel to preach to them that dwell on the   earth,—to every nation, kindred, tongue   and people, saying with a loud voice, "Fear   God and give glory to Him, for the hour of   His judgment is come, and worship Him   who made the heavens, the earth, the seas   and the fountains of water." [##Revelation 14:7##] You may   take up Isaiah and all the prophets, and   you will find that they refer to this latter-  day dispensation, when the Kingdom of   God should be established on the earth.   There never was a prophet, from Adam   down, whose records we have, but had his   eye upon this great dispensation of the last   days. When the Lord created the earth He   placed men upon it, and though the power   of sin has entered it, it has not been left by   the Lord to go at random. In Adam all  fell, or died, but in Christ, the apostle says,   all are made alive. [##1 Corinthians 15:22##] Our worthy President   has often said, when speaking upon the   prevalence of sin in this world, that one of   the greatest honors and blessings ever con-  ferred on the sons of men, was to come and   dwell in the flesh in a sinful world like this,   amid the power of evil, temptation and   darkness, that they might have the privi-  lege of overcoming them and of inheriting   eternal life, which is the greatest gift of   God. All the prophets have foreseen the   establishment of the Kingdom of God in the   last days; they have seen Zion pass through   all her travail and persecution to her final   triumph, when she possessed great glory,   power and dominion upon the land of   Joseph. Daniel saw the kingdom of God,   which he likens to a little stone cut out of   the mountains without hands, which grew   and increased in size until it filled the whole   earth. Daniel said this kingdom was to be an   everlasting kingdom. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]    Well, brethren and sisters, you and I   have lived to see the dawn of the great day   thus referred to by the prophets, in which   the God of heaven has set His hand for the   last time to establish His kingdom upon   the earth; a kingdom not to be overthrown,   but to remain until sin, Satan and the   power of the devil are banished from the   face thereof, and until, as the prophets have   said, the kingdoms of this world shall be-  come the kingdoms of our God and His   Christ.    This day we have lived to see. This taber-  nacle, this congregation, and the multitudes   through the valleys of the mountains are   the fruits of this work. How did it com-  mence? It commenced by an angel of God   flying through the midst of heaven and   visiting a young man named Joseph Smith,   in the year 1827. That was the time of a   great awakening among the sectarians of   the day—a day of revivals and protracted   meetings, when the people were called upon   to join themselves to the sectarian churches.   This young man looked around amid the   the confusion among the different sects,   each proclaiming the plan of salvation dif-  ferently, and each claiming it was right and   that all others were wrong; in the midst of   this contention he did not know which to   join. While in this state of uncertainty he   turned to the Bible, and there saw that pas-  sage in the epistle of James which directs   him that lacks wisdom to ask of God. He   went into his secret chamber and asked the   Lord what he must do to be saved. The   Lord heard his prayer and sent His angel to   him, who informed him that all the sects   were wrong, and that the God of heaven was   about to establish His work upon the earth.   This angel quoted many of the prophecies   of Isaiah, and Jeremiah and told this   young man that they were about to be ful-  filled among the nations of the earth; and   he also told him that if he would listen and   render obedience to the commands of God,   he should be an instrument in the hands of   the Lord in establishing His kingdom upon the earth. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:27-54##]    These visits were repeated from time to   time, during which Joseph received revela-  tion and much instruction in the things of   God. He taught some of these things to   his father and some of his brothers and a   few others, but he had no authority to   preach or administer in the ordinances of   the house of God. Why? Because, as the   prophet has said, "No man taketh this   honor unto himself, except he be called of   God, as was Aaron." [##Hebrews 5:4##] No man, in any gener-  ation, has ever had authority to preach the   Gospel of Jesus Christ unless he was called   by revelation. You may read the history   of all the prophets and apostles from the   creation down, and they have all received   the holy priesthood under the hands of God   or angels, or under the hands of men who   have held this authority. It was so with   Joseph Smith. He could not find anybody   who possessed this authority, and he called   upon the Lord to know what to do, and the   Lord sent John the Baptist, who was be-  headed for his religion. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8##] John held   the Aaronic priesthood, and he came   and ordained Joseph Smith to the same   priesthood. This gave him power to ad-  minister in some of the ordinances of the   gospel of Christ. He could baptize for the   remission of sins, but he could not lay on   hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. The   Lord afterwards sent Peter, James and   John, who held the keys of the kingdom in  their day and generation upon the earth,   and they ordained him an apostle, and   sealed upon his head every key, power and   blessing, and all the authority which they   exercised in their day. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##]    This is the origin of the authority of the  the Latter-day Saints; and from that day   until the present the little stone cut out of   the mountain has been growing. The   Church was organized on the 6th of April,   1830, with six members, and the elders im-  mediately went forth, one here and another   there, bearing testimony and preaching the   doctrines the angel made known to Joseph,   and some few, out of many, have received   and obeyed the same. This gospel is the   the same as that taught by the ancient   apostles, namely, faith in the Lord Jesus   Christ, repentance of sin, baptism for the   remission of sin, then the laying on of   hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost.   These were the doctrines taught by the   ancient apostles, and the signs that followed   believers anciently follow them in our day.   Said Jesus, when sending his apostles   forth, to preach:    "Go ye into all the world and preach the gos-  pel to every creature.    "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be   saved; but he that believeth not shall be   damned.    "And these signs shall [f]ollow them that be-  lieve: In my name they shall cast out devils;   they shall speak with new tongues;    "They shall take up serpents; and if they   drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them;   they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall   recover." [##Mark 16:15-18##]    All these gifts and graces were promised   by Joseph and the early elders of the   Church, just the same as by the ancient   Apostles; and this is the testimony that   every elder has borne from that day until   the present. Has the Lord backed up this   testimony? He has. All of the Twelve   who have labored abroad, and we have   been doing so, more or less, thirty or forty years,  traveling hundreds of thousands of miles,—  have made this declaration. I have preached   to millions of my fellow-men in my own   and other countries; and I and the other   apostles, as well as hundreds of elders of   this Church and Kingdom, have all made   the same proclamation, to kings, princes,   presidents and rulers and to the inhabit-  ants of the earth wherever we have gone as   far as we have had an opportunity and have   had the privilege of opening our mouths.   We have borne the same testimony to all—  namely, that all who would receive our   testimony and obey the Gospel should re-  ceive the Holy Ghost. Would we have   dared to go forth and bear this testimony if   we had not known this was the work of   God? No, there is not a man on the face of   the earth who dare do it under any other   circumstances, for his hypocrisy and decep-  tion would soon have been apparent; the   very first man that received his testimony   would have proved it. Could we have   gathered our hundreds of thousands from   the nations of the earth if we had been de-  ceivers, and had preached false doctrines?   As the Apostle says, "But though we or an   angel from heaven preach any other gospel   unto you than that which we have preached   unto you, let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] No, we   should have had no success; we might have   preached false doctrines until we were grey,   or as old as Methusaleh, but if we had we  should never have seen Utah, this taberna-  cle or these valleys of the mountains. But   the Lord backed up our testimony, and   tens of thousands throughout this Territory   and in the world, who received it,   can bear record that they have re-  ceived the Holy Ghost, and the revelations   of Jesus Christ, and that the gifts and graces   of the gospel have followed them.    This Church is organized exactly as it   was anciently—with apostles, prophets,   pastors, teachers, gifts, helps and govern-  ments. Are all apostles, or are all pro-  phets? Do all have the gifts of healing, or   do all speak with new tongues? No, but   all these gifts and offices are in the Church,   and, as the apostle says, they are placed   there for the work of the ministry, for the  edifying of the body of Christ, and for the   perfecting of the Saints—until we are come   to the unity of the faith, to the knowledge of   the Son of God and to the fulness of the   stature of a man in Christ Jesus. That is   what they are given for, and they are needed   just as much as they ever were in any gen-  eration. But the world has been without   these blessings and wandering in darkness   for nearly eighteen centuries. Now the   Lord has raised up a people to establish His   Kingdom on the same foundation as an-  ciently. This is the work of the Latter-day   Saints. We have been called to warn this   generation; we understand the signs of the   times and know that the judgments of God   are at hand. If we had not been faithful to   our calling and mission, the Lord would   have raised up another people, because the   set time is at hand for Him to establish His   Kingdom.    There are one or two ideas more I wish to   refer to, with regard to the mission of   Christ. That mission did not end when He   was crucified. When that event took place   we are told that his body lay in the tomb   for three days, and that His spirit went to   preach to the spirits in prison, which some-  time were disobedient when the long suf-  fering of God waited in the days of Noah,   while the ark was preparing. Jesus went   and preached to them in the spirit that they   might be judged according to men in the   flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] Here is a principle of which the   Christian world know nothing, and which   has been revealed to us in our own day  —namely, preaching the gospel of life and   salvation to the spirits of those who pass   away without rendering obedience there-  unto. Nearly eighteen hundred years have   passed away since God had a church upon   the earth. In that time about fifty-four   thousand millions of human beings have   passed away without the gospel. Are they   to perish because they lived in generations   when God had no Church on the earth?   No, they will be preached to by men who   go into the spirit world, who hold the keys   of the Kingdom of God, and the ordinances   of the house of God will be administer-  ed to them by their descendants and friends   here on the earth. The Apostle Paul evi-  dently had his mind on this subject when   he says, "Why then are they baptized for   the dead if the dead rise not?" [##1 Corinthians 15:29##]    I do not know how fully Brother Benson   has attended to the work for his dead, but   I know that he has worked hard for the   living; and when he goes into the spirit world   and meets with those for whom he has been   baptized and been the means of liberating   them from prison in the spirit world, what   joy he will have! And it will be so with   others. And this work of administering   the ordinances of the house of God to the   dead, I may say, will require the whole of   the millennium, with Jesus at the head of the   resurrected dead to attend to it. The ordin-  ances of salvation will have to be attended   to for the dead who have not heard the gos-  pel, from the days of Adam down before   Christ can present this world to the Father   and say "It is finished." [##John 19:30##]    Brethren and sisters, let us be admonish-  ed by the death of Brother Benson, and if   we have anything to do let us do it. Let   us go to and attend to our ordinances, then   when we go to the spirit world and meet   with father, mother brother or sister they   cannot rise up and accuse us of negligence.   I have attended to the ordinances for a   great many of my friends, and I want you   to do the same, so that when we get to the   other side of the vail we may look back   and be satisfied. This power has been   placed in the hands of the Latter-day Saints,   then let us go forth and use it for the salva-  tion of the living and the dead. With re-  gard to the unbelief of the world, it will   not make the truth of God without effect.   These ordinances have been revealed to us;   we understand them, and unless we attend   to them we shall fall under condemnation.    I rejoice in the work of God and I rejoice   to live in this day and age of the world.   I want to live as long as I can do good; but   not an hour longer than I can live in fel-  lowship with the Holy Spirit, with my   Father in heaven, my Savior and with the   faithful Latter-day Saints. To live any   longer than this would be torment and   misery to me. When my work is done I   am ready to go; but I want to do what is   required of me. The gospel is the power   of God unto salvation to all who believe,   both Jew and Greek. Let us be faithful,   keep our covenants, do our duty, and at-  tend to all the ordinances of the gospel as   far as we can, both for ourselves and our   dead. When we have done this we shall   be satisfied. I pray that God may bless   you; that he may bless the apostles who   dwell on the earth; that His power may   rest on the presiding Twelve, the Seven-  ties, the High Priests, the Bishops, Elders,   Teachers and Deacons, and all who have   entered into covenant to keep His com-  mandments. Let us be faithful and we   shall obtain our reward; we shall overcome   and obtain eternal life and a crown of   glory if we magnify our calling by living   the religion which we have received, which   may God grant for Christ's sake, Amen. 
 upon the wicked, I will be inquired of by  you to ask the Father in my name to do and  to perform these things for you, as I told   all the house of Israel by my servant Moses that  they should ask at my hand for all those  blessings which I the Lord have promised  unto Israel in the latter days. And as I  the Lord ordained mine apostles who were with  me in my ministry, and promised them  that they should sit upon twelve thrones,  judging the twelve tribes of Israel, so I say  unto you, mine apostles, whom I have  raised up in these last days, that I have  ordained you to bear record of my name,   and of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the Gen-  tiles first, and then to the house of Israel. I  have also ordained you to sit upon thrones  and judge the Gentiles and all of the inhabi-  tants of the earth unto whom you have borne  testimony of my name in the day and genera-  tion in which you live. Therefore, how great  is your calling and responsibility before me!  Therefore, gird up the loins of your minds and  magnify your calling in the fear of God, and  prepare ye for the coming of the Son of Man,  which is nigh at the door. No man knoweth 
 Ponton U. T. County  June 4th 1858    Elder W.

 did not believe in any more revelation.  This would be a great mistake. For if   we had before us every revelation which  God ever gave to man; if we had the   Book of Enoch; if we had the untrans-  lated plates before us in the English  language; if we had the records of the  Revelator St. John which are sealed up,  and all other revelations, and they were  piled up here a hundred feet high, the  Church and kingdom of God could not  grow, in this or any other age of the   world, without the living oracles of  God.    The Presidency of the Church is com-  posed of three men—the President and  his Counselors; and not only does the  President of the Church need revela-  tion daily, in order to pass through the  labor, the care and the business that  rests upon him, but his Counselors need  it. Every one of the Twelve Apostles  need it in all their administrations  throughout the world; and not only the  Twelve Apostles, but the Seventies, the  High Priests, the Bishops, the Elders  and all who belong to the Melchisedec  or Aaronic Priesthood—all need it in  their administrations in the world. No  man can go forth and lift up his voice and  declare the Gospel of Jesus Christ with-  out revelation. He needs the Holy  Priesthood with him; he needs the Holy  Ghost with him every day of his life. I   do not wish to be misunderstood in this  matter. Every man or woman that has  ever entered into the Church of God  and been baptized for the remission of  sins, has a right to revelation; yes,  women have a right to revelation, a  right to the Spirit of God, to assist  them in their labors, in their administra-  tions to their children, in counseling   their children and those over whom  they are called to preside. The Holy  Ghost is not restricted to men, nor to  Apostles or Prophets, it belongs to every  faithful man and woman, and to every  child who is old enough to receive the   Gospel of Christ.    I am very much opposed to false  doctrine, either preaching it myself or  having anybody else preach it. I there-  fore wish to make this correction if there  is any need of it. God never had a   Church or a people, in any age of the  world, that were ever governed and con-  trolled except by revelation. The living   oracles of God were among them—those  who held the keys of the Kingdom, and  they had to receive revelation to assist  them in all their work. The Elders of  Israel, when they go abroad to the  nations of the earth, need the Spirit of  God, to tell them to go here, or go  there, that they may search out the   honest in heart. Let us all understand   this, so that we may not be divided in  our views and sentiments. 
 Sacramento Aug 6th    Dear Br Woodruff    By the request of Br Garlick,  I write to let you know how we are doing   in Sacramento. Br Lowba came here last   fall and organized a branch of the Church,  since then we have held meetings every   Sunday, and have had a good degree of   the Holy Spirit, in its light, and Intelligence.  The old saints who are here mostly belong to   the young Josephites, and do not come to   our meetings. If any of the Elders should   be coming this way Br Garlick would   like them to call on him, he lives on Second  street between N and O streets, we have had   one letter from Br Lowba from New York,  he could not find any saints there. It seems   to me that the Old saints have got into a   state of darkness in regard to the old Church,  and their minds are no longer enlightened  by the spirit of Truth, and having lost that,   they are liable to be deceived by anything   that comes along, here we find some of them  Spiritualists, some Second Adventists, some   Josephits, but in themselves seem to have no   true foundation, so that when Christ comes   they will be found among the foolish virgins   with their lamps gone out, and no oil or   light of the Holy Spirit to replenish them.

 Provo City Oct 18th 1869    Hon. Wilford Woodruff  Dear Sir    O. G. Hollister Esqe U. S. Collecter   desired me to procure him statistics of Irrigation, and of the   Labor and cost in general of settling and improving this Territory    If you have any information on the subject will you   please favor by communicating with Mr Hollister or myself    Yours very Respectfully    John B.

 their families for several years at a   time, but now the key is turned to   the seed of Israel, they are right here  in our midst scattered abroad among  these mountains. "What," says one,   "preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to  these natives?" Yes, God has deter-  mined that seeing the Gentiles count  themselves unworthy of eternal life,  he will through the instrumentality  of his servants cause salvation to go  to Israel in the mountains, and fulfil the  promises which were made to their  fathers hundreds of years ago. When  you see the servitude in which the  poor of mankind are kept in the  various nations, and the privations,  abominations, and oppression that   grind down the inhabitants of the   earth, does it not make us feel for  them? And to whom can they look  for deliverance? They never will   find it but through the instrumental-  ity of this people, for into their hand  the kingdom is given never more to   be destroyed, but it will spread and   increase until all have had an oppor-  tunity of receiving the truth in all   nations. And those that will not   keep the commandments of God will  feel his chastening rod, for he will   purify and cleanse the earth that it  may be prepared for the coming of  Christ.    The kingdom of God will remain  upon the earth, and the holy Priest-  hood will rest down upon these our  neighbours as well as we, and the   keys of power will remain with this  people for ever and be used for their  redemption, for this is the decree of   the Almighty. If we do not do our   duty as a people we shall be chastened  and whipped until we learn obedience.  Then, I say, that it is for us to work   to build up his kingdom, whatever   we are instructed to do, that we   should perform at all times and listen  to the counsels of his servants what-  ever may be the consequences. Yes,   brethren, the time is at hand when   we are and shall be required to put   forth our hands and do a great work  upon the earth, and the dead branches  must be cut off in order that there  may be room for the kingdom of God  to grow. We see the jud[g]ments of   God spreading among the nations of  the earth, and what are our feelings?   My feelings are, that it is according   to the prophecies of those men who  were inspired in days that are gone.  Well, do I delight in seeing the   wicked destroyed? No, I do not; but  I delight in seeing the righteous get  what they look for, happiness and   eternal life. Is it a benefit for the   wicked portion of mankind to live or  to die and go down to the grave? It   is better for the people to go down to  the grave than to live upon the earth;  when the principles of salvation are   offered to the world, it is better that   they should cease to live than bring   thousands of posterity into the world  who will like themselves do wickedly,  for the wicked and the ungodly  of the earth will not receive the  Gospel of Christ, and the earth is  bound to be cleansed that there may  be room for the righteous to live, for  a holy and righteous generation to be  raised up and the name of God   honoured among men. These are my   feelings upon that subject. And it   will be just so with us, we will be   under greater condemnation than any  other people if we neglect our duties,   because we have received the Priest-  hood of God, and have learned what   is right and what is wrong. How   many of our brethren now present   before the light of revelation came   felt as we do now? Would we not   have given anything in the world  that we possessed to have had the  privilege of listening to the teachings  we have had this day? We were  then like the blind groping for the  wall, and all we had to do was to   walk by the little light we could get.  We were then filled with traditions of 
 the day nor the hour. But the signs of both  heaven and earth indicate his coming, as pro-  mised by the mouths of my disciples. The fig  tree is leaving and the hour is nigh. Therefore,   prepare yourselves, O ye Saints of the Most High  God, with oil in your lamps, for blessed is he  that watcheth for the coming of the Son of Man.    Again, hear ye the word of the Lord,  O ye mine apostles, whom I have chosen in  these last days to bear record of my name  and to lead my people Israel until the  coming of the Son of Man, I the Lord have  raised up unto you my servant John Tay-  lor to preside over you and to be a lawgiver  unto my church. He has mingled ^his blood^ with that  of the martyred prophets. Nevertheless, while   I have taken my servants Joseph and Hyrum  unto myself, I have preserved my servant   John Taylor for a wise purpose in me. I  have also taken many others of the apostles  unto myself, for I take whom I will take,  and preserve in life whom I will preserve, ac-  cording to the counsel of my own will. And  while my servant John Taylor is your pres-  ident, I wish to ask the rest of my servants  of the apostles the question, Although you have

 Noticed in History    March 3rd 1853  Note to Journal    Bro Woodruff    Dear Sir, my clerk has negulected some  of the most important items connected with the  breaking out of the Small-pox in our compa^n^y.  When it ^was^ discouvered that this loathsome disease was  in our midst, a general feeling of horror siezed the  Capt & crew, & many of the Saints. The Capt  wanted to turn about & put in to some port  of Spain or Portugal. Said he would loose half  his Sailors. Would be compeled to lay in  Quarantine 2 or 3 months if we proceeded to  New Orleans &c. &c    I opposed turing back in the strongest terms  & told the Capt ^in the name of the Lord^ that if he would proceed, not  one of his Sailors should be sick, & that we would  not be detained one hour in Quarantine.    Well, said he I will go, on & if it is as you say I will  promise that I will believe you to be a prophet  & that there is something in mormonism, whether  I am ever a mormon or not.    When we got to New Orleans, we were pronounced  the healthiest company that ever sailed into that  port. The Capt left me with tears, & said  Mr Young, God grant we may meet again.    I mention this circumstance to show that 
 before the God of heaven—and so  will all men—for the course I pursue  in this life.    There is one very peculiar feature   with regard to the followers of Jesus  Christ, or those that have attempted  in other dispensations to obey the   law of heaven, and that is, their   unpopularity in the world from the  days of Father Adam to the present  time. Trace it through from the  beginning, and you will find that men  who were inspired by Almighty God   to go forth and proclaim any mes-  sage to the inhabitants of the earth,  have been most unpopular in their   day and generation. You will find   it has been so in the whole history  of the world. You may go back, for  instance, to the days of Noah. Noah   was a preacher of righteousness. He  was called of God. He was warned  of God, and told what to do to save   himself and family. The world had   become terribly corrupt, and it was  necessary that the people be called   upon to repent. To this end God   Almighty raised up a prophet. That  prophet was Noah. He went forth   as he was commanded and preached  the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its   purity and truth. He was commanded   to build an ark on dry land. The  people laughed at him and would  not believe his testimony. For one  hundred and twenty years he  warned the inhabitants of the earth  of the coming flood; but all that he   could save were the members of his  own family, some eight souls. The   flood came, and all the inhabitants  of the earth, save those who had   entered the ark, were drowned. [##Genesis 6-7##]  Their spirits were shut up in prison   in the spirit world, and they re-  mained there until after the death   of Jesus Christ; and while His body   lay in the tomb three and a half  days He went and preached to those  spirits in prison, where they had  been shut up for thousands of   years. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##]    As it was with Noah so it was  with other Prophets who lived in   ancient days. You may trace the  history of Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,  Isaiah, and the rest down to the  days of Jesus Christ, and you find   they were all unpopular in their day   and generation. In consequence  of the wickedness that prevailed  in the world, those Prophets were  moved upon to prophesy concerning  the destruction of Babylon the   great, [##Jeremiah 50##] Ninevah, [##Nahum 1-3##] Tyre, [##Ezekiel 26##] and many   other ancient cities; they declared  the word of the Lord to the inhab-  itants of these cities, but their  testimony was not believed; and   because of their unpopularity, the   Prophets were put to death.   Nevertheless, not one jot or tittle  of their predictions fell to the ground   unfulfilled. [##Matthew 5:18##]    Then, again, you come along   down to the days of Jesus Christ.   You trace His life from His birth   in a stable to the tomb. Was ever   a man on the earth—a good man   like the Savior—so persecuted,   opposed, ridiculed and derided as He  was by the Jews, Pharisees, Sad-  ducees, and the different sects of  that day? No matter what He did   it was attributed to him for evil. If  He cast out devils it was attributed  to the power of Beelzebub. [##Matthew 12:22-37##] If He   restored the blind to sight, they   were ready to cry out, "You give  God the glory, this man is a sinner."  And so in all His works was He   opposed, persecuted and derided.   And His Apostles shared the same   fate. Every soul of them—with the   exception of John—had to lay down  their lives and seal their testimony   with their blood. Some were  beheaded, some were sawn asunder.  Even in the case of John they  sought his life, but it was decreed

During the   last five years I have been writing on the   principles of our Holy Religion. I read some   of the articles to Br Lowba and he wished me   to have them published in Utah for the   benefit of the Children. It was on this subject   I wrote to Br Campbell sending him a list.  I wish you would see him, and let me know   if he received my letter, and if he thinks it   will do any good to publish them. To my-  self they have been a great source of instru-  ction, and if they would be of any service in   helping to build up the Church of God,   I shall feel amply repaid for the time and   labour bestow^e^d in writing them. I send   you a list and if you wish it will send  you a copy of any one you select. I hope   you will answer this at your earliest   convenience.

 M. J. Ellingwood    Whitewater, Wis.,   June 30, 1892.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,   Dear Sir:    Your favor of June ninth   was received, and we wish to thank you for   your kindness. I should have written before, but   have been thinking some one might see the   piece in the paper that knew my son and   so give me some information concerning him.  But as yet we have heard nothing about   him. Some one told me that about a  year ago some of the Mormons went to   New Mexico to build a railroad. Do you   know of any body that went? If you do,   and would send me their names I would   write to them and would be greatly obliged   to you for your assistance. Do you know   of any way in which I can obtain any   knowledge concerning him? Do you think if   his father should go out there he could 
 one to preside over your quorum, which is the  order of God in all generations, do you not,   all of you, hold the apostleship, which is the  highest authority ever given to men on the  earth? You do. Therefore, you hold in  common the keys of the kingdom of God  in all the world. You each of you have  power to unlock the vail of eternity and  hold converse with God the Father, and  his son Jesus Christ, and to have the  administration of angels. It is your  right, privilege, and duty to inquire of  the Lord as to his mind and will concerning  yourselves and the inhabitants of Zion and  their interests. And whenever any one of  you receives the word of the Lord, let it be  written and presented in your councils.   And whatever, by united consent, you deem  wisdom to be presented unto the people, let   it be presented by the president, my servant  John Taylor, as the word of the Lord. In  this way you will uphold him and strength-  en his hands, as all the burden should not  lie upon one man. For thus saith the  Lord, All mine apostles should be full of the  Holy Ghost, of inspiration and revelation, to know 
 544 THE DESERET NEWS. Dec. 22.    the earth are honoring God, acknowledg-  ing His hand in all things and keeping His  commandments? Very few. Just the   same to-day as in the days of Noah. We   read that one of a family and two of a city   will be gathered to Zion in the last days.   Out of twelve hundred millions, that dwell  on the face of the earth, we, after forty  years' labor, have succeeded in gathering a   few thousands together to the valleys of   the mountains. The numbers are very  few; [b]ut this few should be faithful.    Last Sabbath, those who were here, list-  ened to a discourse from Bro. Geo. Q.  Cannon, in which he delivered his testi-  mony concerning Joseph Smith and Presi-  dent Young. I thought to myself, it seemed  a kind of a queer idea that, at this late date,  one of the Apostles should be called upon,  to stand up in the sacred desk and defend   the characters of these men as prophets and  apostles. Yet so it was, and these things  are necessary.    Joseph Smith was what he professed to  be, a prophet of God, a seer and revelator.   He laid the foundation of this church and  kingdom, and lived long enough to deliver  the keys of the kingdom to the elders of   Israel, unto the Twelve Apostles. He spent  the last winter of his life, some three or four  months, with the quorum of the Twelve  teaching them. It was not merely a few  hours ministering to them the ordinances   of the Gospel; but he spent day after day,   week after week and month after month,   teaching them and a few others the things   of the kingdom of God. Said he, during  that period, "I now rejoice. I have lived  until I have seen this burden, which has   rested on my shoulders, rolled on to the  shoulders of other men; now the keys of   the kingdom are planted on the earth to be  taken away no more for ever." But until   he had done this, they remained with him;  and had he been taken away they would  have had to be restored by messengers   out of heaven. But he lived until every key,  power and principle of the holy priesthood  was sealed on the Twelve and on President  Young, as their President. He told us   that he was going away to leave us, going  away to rest. Said he, "you have to round  up your shoulders to bear off the kingdom.   No matter what becomes of me, I have  desired to see that Temple built, but I shall   not live to see it. You will; you are called   upon to bear of this kingdom." This lan-  guage was plain enough, but we did not   understand, it any more than the disciples  of Jesus when he told them He was going  away, and that if he went not the Comforter  would not come. It was just so with Jos-  eph. He said this time after time to the  Twelve and to the Female Relief Societies  and in his public discourses; but none of   us seemed to understand that he was going   to seal his testimony with his blood, but so   it was. What he said to us and the church   we have had to perform. Joseph Smith was  a good man, a prophet of God. His works   are before the world; they are before the  eyes of the nation; they are before the hea-  vens and the earth. The foundation that   he laid we have built upon until the pres-  ent day; and that foundation no power on   earth or in hell will ever be able to remove.  That church and kingdom of God that is   planted here in these valleys of the moun-  tains will remain on the earth until the   little stone Daniel saw will become a moun-  tain and fill the earth, until the reign of   Jesus is supreme and universal.    It startles men when they hear the   Elders of Israel tell about the kingdoms of  this world becoming the kingdom of our   God and His Christ. They say it is trea-  son for men to teach that the kingdom Dan-  iel saw is going to be set up, and bear rule   over the whole earth. Is it treason for God  Almighty to govern the earth? Who made  it? God, did He not? Who made you?   God, if you have any eternal Father. Well  whose right is it to rule and reign over you  and the earth? It does not belong to the   devil, nor to men. It has never been given  to men yet; it has never been given to the   nations. It belongs solely to God and He  is coming to rule and reign over it. When  will that be? It may not be perfected un-  til Christ comes in the clouds of heaven  with power and great glory to reward every  man according to the deeds done in the  body. That kingdom, the germ of which  is planted here, will continue to grow and  will never be overthrown. As I said before,  no matter what takes place outside of this  Territory—we as Latter-day Saints should  exercise faith in God, for just as sure as   God was true to Daniel, Moses, Noah,   Enoch and to the prophets and Apostles, so  will He be true to us; so will He be true to  His word in these latter days and will ful-  fill all He has said.    This is the work we have to perform. It  is a good work, a great work, a glorious  work, and one in which the Latter-day   Saints should rejoice, for it confers upon  them the privilege of being instruments in  the hands of God of helping to build up His   kingdom on the earth. This should give   us joy, and the promises made to us in con-  nection with this work ought to sustain us  and give us hope, joy, and consolation.    I have been happy since I formed the  acquaintance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ:   I was never satisfied until I found the Lat-  ter-day Saints. In my boyhood I could  read in the Bible and New Testament of a   people who had power with God, who had  the gifts and graces, who could command   the elements and they obeyed them; who  had power to heal the sick, and had the  gifts of the Holy Ghost imparted unto   them by God himself. That was the kind  of religion I always desired to live to see.   I desired to live to see a prophet and an  Apostle, or some man who was inspired of   God who could teach me the way to be  saved. I have lived to see that day.  I rejoice in it for I know it is true.   I know this work is true. I know it is  the kingdom of God, as you do, and as  all men do who have received the testimony  of the Holy Spirit and have been faithful   for themselves.    As to President Young his labors have   been with us. It has been remarked some  -times, by certain individuals, that President   Young has said in public that he was not a   prophet nor the son of a prophet. I have  traveled with him since 1833 or the spring   of 1834; I have travelled a good many thou-  sand miles with him and have heard   him preach a great many thousand ser-  mons; but I have never heard him   make that remark in my [l]ife. He is   a prophet, I am a prophet, you are, and  anybody is a prophet who has the testi-  mony of Jesus Christ, for that is the spirit  of prophecy. The Elders of Israel are pro-  phets. A prophet is not so great as an   apostle. Christ has set in his Church, first,   apostles; they hold the keys of the kingdom  of God. Any man who has travelled with   President Young knows he is a prophet of   God. He has foretold a great many things  that have come to pass. All the Saints who  are well acquainted with him know that he   is governed and controlled by the power of   God and the revelations of Jesus Christ.   His works are before the world; they are  before the heavens; before the earth; before  the wicked as well as the righteous; and it   is the influence of President Young that  the world is opposed to. This Priesthood,  these keys of the Kingdom of God that  have been sealed upon him, the world is at   war against; let them say what they may,   these things are what they are at enmity   with. Their present objection to the Latter-  day Saints, they say, is plurality of wives.   It is this principle they are trying to   raise a persecution against now. But how   was it in Missouri, Kirtland, Jackson   county, Far West, Caldwell county, in all   our drivings and afflictions, before this   principle was revealed to the Church? Cer-  tainly it was not polygamy then. No, it   was prophets, it was revelation, it was the  organization of an institution founded by   revelation from God. They did not believe  in that, and that was the objection in those   days. If we were to do away with poly-  gamy, it would only be one feather in the   bird, one ordinance in the Church and   Kingdom. Do away with that, then we   must do away with prophets and apostles,   with revelation and the gifts and graces of   the Gospel, and finally give up our religion   altogether and turn sectarians and do as the   world does, then all would be right. We   just can't do that, for God has commanded   us to build up His Kingdom and to bear  our testimony to the nations of the earth,  and we are going to do it, come life or come  death. He has told us to do thus, and we   shall obey Him in days to come as we have  in days past.    Brethren and sisters, let us exercise faith;  the ancient prophets lived by faith; it is as  necessary for us as for them. I believe   what God has said will be fulfilled. I be-  lieve the Book of Mormon and the Book   of Doctrine and Covena[n]ts will be fulfilled,  and all the promises and prophecies made  by the faithful servants of God. When   any man speaks as he is moved upon by  the Holy Ghost, that is the word of God to   the people; and though the heavens and  the earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of   the word of God will fall unfulfilled. I   care not whether it be by His own voice  out of the heavens; by the ministration of  angels; by the voice of a prophet, or by the   inspiration of the Holy Ghost through   His servants, it is the word of God to the   people; it is truth and it will have its effect  and fulfillment. Everything that has been   communicated to us by revelation I believe  to be true; many of them I know. I have   faith and knowledge, both in a degree. I   want more; I wish for more, and all I ask  is that the Lord will enable me to be faith-  ful. I wish eternal life. I want salvation.   This is the object of my life; for this I em-  braced "Mormonism." This is the princi-  ple that has sustained me from the time I   entered this church and kingdom. This  hope sustained me when I shouldered my   knapsack and went forth to travel and   preach without purse or scrip, thousands  of miles through the United States. This  principle of inspiration has sustained the   elders of Israel in every age of the world.   It is that which sustained Joseph Smith   from the day he commenced his career as   a servant of God until the time that he   sealed his testimony with his blood. Some-  body has got to pay the bill for the shed-  ding of that innocent blood. Shedding in-  nocent blood has cost the Jews eighteen   hundred years of suffering, mourning, woe   and destruction; it has cost this nation   already four years of war, with two millions  of men laid in the dust, and four thousand   million dollars in money; and woe be to   that nation, tongue or people that sheds   the blood of the Saints of God, or under-  takes to oppose the work of God in this or   any other generation. They will have to   reap what they sow; for what you sow you   will reap, and the reward you mete will be   rewarded to you again, whether you are   Saints or sinners, in all nations, kindreds,   tongues and people under the whole heav-  ens.    This is the position that we occupy. This   warfare is not between man and man but   between God and the world. If the Lord  does not defend the Latter-day Saints we   cannot defend ourselves. We can do what   is required of us, but God, Himself, has to   defend us. He has done it and He will   continue to do it until the coming of the   Lord Jesus Christ, or until his Kingdom  triumphs on the earth. This is my faith;  and I would rather, to-day, lay down my  life, honoring the faith once delivered to the  Saints, than turn round and fear men, who   have power only to kill the body, instead   of fearing Him who has power to cast both   soul and body into hell. Salvation is of   more consequence to me and to this people,   and to all the inhabitants of the earth, than   anything else. What is the world with its   honors, gold, silver, thrones, principalities   and powers compared with salvation? They  all end at death, they are of no force after,   and are of no moment when compared   with eternal salvation. Oh, what glorious   principles have been revealed to the Latter-  day Saints! Where did you get them? How   did you obtain them? Through the voice   of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young by   revelation from God. That is the way we   obtained them. The principles of the Gospel   of Jesus Christ have power and efficacy   after death; they will bring together men   and their wives and children in the family  organization and will re-unite them worlds   without end. The power of those who sit  upon thrones in this life will end at their   death; they will have no extra power in the   world to come because they have occupied   thrones in this. The Czar of Russia, the   Emperor of France, the Queen of England,   or any other sovereign, will not have any  additional power in the world to come   because of their present glory. It will all   end with their death. These are the king-  doms of men, they are not ordained of God.  True, they will be held accountable for the   exercise of their power here; God will hold  them responsible for that, but so far as  salvation and glory hereafter are concerned  their exalted positions here will not avail   them anything. There is not a man who   has lived since the Church went into the   wilderness and the Kingdom of God was  taken from the earth, until Moroni rent the   vail and gave to Joseph Smith the records   of the Book of Mormon, and until Peter,   James and John sealed upon him the keys   of the Holy Priesthood, who can claim a   wife in the resurrection. Not one of them  has been married for eternity, but only   until death. But unto the Latter-day   Saints the sealing ordinances have been  revealed, and they will have effect after   death, and, as I have said, will re-unite  men and women eternally in the family   organization. Herein is why these princi-  ples are a part of our religion, and by them   husbands and wives, parents and children  will be re-united until the links in the   chain are re-united back to Father Adam.   We could not obtain a fullness of celestial   glory without this sealing ordinance or the  institution called the patriarchal order of   marriage, which is one of the most glorious  principles of our religion. I would just as   lief the United States Government would   pass a law against my being baptized for the  remission of my sins, or against my re-  ceiving the Holy Ghost, as against my   practising the patriarchal order of mar-  riage. I would just as lief they would take  away any other principle of the Gospel as   this. The opinion of men generally, in   relation to this subject, is that the Latter-  day Saints practise it for the gratification of   their carnal desires; but such ideas are   wholly untrue. The world seek after this;   but the Saints of God practise this principle  that they may partake of eternal lives, that   they may have wives and posterity in the   world to come and throughout the endless   ages of eternity.    God promised to Abraham that his seed   should be as numerous as the stars in the   heaven or as the sands on the sea shore.   We all know, from reading the history of   Abraham, that this promise has not been   fulfilled, for you may take one square   yard of sand on the sea shore, and the  grains it would contain would be more  numerous than all the inhabitants that ever   lived on the earth; hence this promise of   the Lord could not be fulfilled if, as the   Christian world imagine, the marriage re-  lation ceases with the termination of this   life, and that after the resurrection there is  no increase. But in the resurrection there   will be no end to the increase of Abraham,  it will continue through all eternity.    These are some of the principles of the   Gospel God has revealed to us. Are they   not worth living for and having faith in?   They are. Then do not fear because of the   wicked. We have everythingto encourage   us. The Latterday Saints should be faith-  ful. We should live our religion and be   true and faithful to our covenants. We  should magnify our callings as Apostles,  Elders and Saints, before God angels and   men. We have but little time to work, and   we should work while it is called to-day;  by and by night comes when no man can  work. When the vision of my mind is  opened and I gaze abroad upon this genera-  tion, I many times feel to mourn in my   spirit to see the darkness and unbelief and   the carelessness of man with regard to his  future and eternal state. Instead of seek-  ing with all their powers to secure to them-  selves eternal life they seem to be doing   their utmost to turn the last key to seal   their condemnation and to make them-  selves the sons of perdition. They will   labor to shed innocent blood and to   destroy the Church and kingdom of God  on the earth. This is one of the promptings  of the evil one.    There are two things which have always   followed apostates in every age of the   world, and especially in our day. In the  early days of the Church, in Kirtland, as   soon as men apostatized from the Church   and Kingdom of God, they immediately   began to fear their fellow men, and to fancy   their lives were in danger. Another pecu-  liarity common to apostates was that they   desired to kill those who had been their   benefactors. This was the case with the   Higbees, Laws and others with regard to   the Prophet Joseph, when they turned   against him, they sought with all their  powers to take away his life. Not only   were they afraid of their own lives, but  they sought to take his, and they eventually   succeeded, and woe is their doom. What  would they not give in exchange for their   souls? But no matter, they cannot redeem   them. This spirit always accompanies the   apostates. What are they afraid of? There   is something they do not understand or   comprehend; they walk in the dark, and by   and by they will unite with the wicked   and try to overthrow the very work they   have been trying to build up.    This spirit has always been with the en-  emies of rightousness. The devil seeks to   overthrow the kingdom of God and the   Saints, and he always will do it as long as  he has any power on the earth; therefore   we should be united. We should be faith-  ful and labor hard to do what we have to  do and not put off anything for the build-  ing up of the kingdom of God. We should   obey all the ordinances we can for our-  selves and our children; for the living and   the dead. We should attend to these things  as we go along, and when we get through   with our work and into the spirit world,   we may look back and be satisfied with   our labors. There is a great deal for the   Latter-day Saints to do. We have done a   good deal, but the work is only just com-  menced. Zion is not what she must be;  Zion is growing. She has grown since we   came to the valleys of the mountains. We  have done something for the living: we   have warned the nations; the garments of   many of us are clear of the blood of this   generation. It cannot rise in judgment   against Joseph Smith, Brigham Young or   the Twelve Apostles, nor against thousands   of the elders of this church and kingdom.   We have lifted up our voices day and night:  we have preached to millions of our fellow   men and have travelled hundreds of thous-  ands of miles to offer this gospel to the na-  tions of the earth. Still they have turned   against us, and a great many of them have   sought our overthrow. They will receive   their reward and we shall receive ours.    What joy, consolation and satisfaction it   will be to the apostles, elders and Saints of   God, of this day, who remain true and faith-  ful to the end! having become members of   the church of the Firstborn, and been val-  iant in the testimony of Jesus, when they  meet Father Adam, Enoch, Jacob, Isaiah,  Jeremiah, Jesus and the apostles, how great  their joy will be! They labored in their   day for the work of God, and their toils are   over; we are having our day and our labor.   By and by we shall meet and mingle in the   eternal world. How fast we pass away!   Where is Bro.Heber, whom we used to see   so often in our midst here and in the En-  dowment House? In the spirit world.  Bro. Willard[,] Joseph, Hyrum, David Pat-  ton, Jedediah, Parley Pratt, and Bro. Ben-  son among the rest, have gone. We shall  all go pretty soon, we shall not remain a   great while. Our labors in this life are   short, and we shall soon pass to the other   side of the vail. Our children, the rising  generation, will possess the kingdom; on   them the labor of rolling on the work of   God will rest, until the kingdom and the  greatness of the kingdom under the whole   heaven will be given to the Saints of the   Most High and they will possess it for ever   and ever, and the meek will inherit the   earth. Let us be diligent, let us be faithful;   let us labor while it is called to-day, that   we may be counted worthy to receive a  reward that will satisfy us in the end.    I pray that God will bless us, that He  will pour out His spirit upon us and give  us the testimony of Jesus Christ; that we  may guard our welfare, and watch our-  selves that our feet may not slip. It is an   awful thing for a man, in any generation,   to receive this gospel, to taste the good word  of God and the powers of the world to   come, and then turn away and lose the testi-  mony of Jesus and turn against God; such a   man's condition is worse than his who   never heard the gospel of Christ. He  will lament and mourn, and that too,   without ever receiving redemption. Such  individuals cannot be redeemed and re-  stored to that which they have forfeited.  It is far better to receive the gospel and be  faithful in the midst of all opposition. If   we continue so, when we meet with the   fathers we can rejoice with them and par-  take of the same kingdom and the same   glory; quickened by the same spirit, hav-  ing kept the same law and been preserved   thereby.    May God bless us all and help us to over-  come the world, the flesh and the devil, for   Jesus sake. Amen.

 our fathers who had inherited vanity,  lies, and things in which there was  no profit. Things are different now,   we know for ourselves, we understand  the things of God, then let us obey   for ourselves that we may prosper.   I feel an anxiety for the welfare of   this people, and I pray that we may  not neglect the blessings that are   given to us, for this is an important  time. While we are in this proba-  tion we should make the best possible   use of our time, for this is the time   to receive life and knowledge and to  lay up treasures in heaven, that where  our heart is, there our treasures may  be also. There are many things in  my mind to speak upon for the  benefit of this people, but I do not  feel to occupy your time longer. I   do feel though that the subject before   us is of all importance to the house of   Israel, and I believe that the Lord   does intend that we should speak to  them, and bring them to understand  the light of truth. They are in   darkness, because their fathers had  the truth and turned away and forsook  the Lord their God. The Prophets  among them wrote records, and in   those records they promised blessings  to their children who should live in   the last days. They promised that  after the cursing and afflictions should  come the blessings, and if the Lord  has taken us from the midst of the   Gentiles and has enlightened our   minds so that we can comprehend  life and death in a great measure,  and the principles of truth that are  being revealed, we should feel satis-  fied with the blessings God has given,  and we should be as ready to preach   to these Lamanites as we are to the   Gentiles. Are they not of the seed   of Israel? Are they not all our   brethren and of the house of Joseph?  Then, brethren, let us take heed, and  when we look upon them and see   their conditions deal with them   wisely, and the Lord will acknowledge  our labours. I will tell you what   I believe about this matter—the   redemption of these natives—had this  people come here under the same  impressions that they had in New   York, in Ohio, in Kentucky, or in  Maine, or in any other State, had they  come when they first received the   Gospel and the Spirit of it, for then  their hearts were touched with the  Spirit of the Gospel of salvation, and  they felt well, and had they have   come here under those impressions  and continued to live under those  impressions which they first received  in relation to these scattered tribes;   I say long before this, had the people  who first settled in Utah Valley lived   up to the first impressions first made  upon their minds, these Utes would   have felt to be our brethren and   sisters. They would have been one   with us, and they would have been  in this Church long ago, and their   children would have been reading  and writing, and you would have seen  some of the young men busily engaged  preaching to the tribes the fulness of   the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If the  Latter-day Saints had come here  when they first received the impres  sion, and the Book of Mormon from  Joseph Smith, this wild degraded  race of men might have been, to a  great extent, civilized and acquainted  with the Gospel. What do you say   brethren, is not that correct? (Loud  cries of "Yes.") I know it is. I  have heard the brethren and sisters  speak in tongues and give interpre-  tations about this very people, and   they would say that they would teach  the Lamanites to spin and sew, and   also to be clean; do they feel so   now? No; I tell you they are back-  sliders from that faith which they  then imbibed; they are lukewarm  and cold to those things which God  has taught us respecting this people  with whom we now live. Well, now,   again, if you will reflect and look 
 find any thing out about him?    Clarence is not a very young man as he   is now about thirty years old.  I wrote to Mr. John Young asking him  if he would please speak of him in church   and see if there was any family there with   whom my son used to board. I have not   yet heard any thing from him.  We are willing to do any thing in our power  and will spare no pains if we can only   gain some information concerning our son.    Will you please answer this letter and tell   us if you think there is any thing you   or we can do about this matter and you  shall be amply rewarded for all your   trouble and kindness.    Respectfully your,  Mrs. M. J. Ellingwood,  Whitewater,  Wis.

 unswerving integrity, applying his humble   Efforts to Extend peace, light & truth to his   fellow creatures, realizes that the Eangels of light   take cognizans of his Endeavors, & crown them   with multiplied blessings from on high; it   far outstrips the possession of worldly wealth   or Station.    I frequently think what an Excel-  lent school it would be for our young Elders,  if all could have a chance to go & preach the   Gospel among the poor and down trodden   class of Society; if at all afflicted with   vanity &or conceit, it meets with a terrible blow  in such ^a^ position, at ^which^ teaches humility &  contentment, and is in reality the way   to obtain the greatest amount of apre-  ciation, & learn ^teat^ us to value the blessings  of heaven.

 Beloit, Kansas,   May 20th 1892    Dear Sir:   I am editing a wirk for a large  publishing house in N. Y. City, in the interest  of Sunday Schools, and private instruction,  upon a unique place.    In our "Common-place" I say,  'The Mormon Church is not known to have  adapted officially the Oxford Bible (containing  King James Version And Anglican Margins)?    Years ago I saw "The Book of Mormon";  but, ^do not^ recollect whether it was an addition to the  Standard; or whether it was [intrudid] to  supersede.    My first series will go on, in manuscript,  in 3 weeks; & I should like to have any statement  about you substantially correct.    Hence please answer the following —    1. Do you use and recommend the 'Oxford' entire?  and [ink blot]    2. Are you in harmony with the American  Bible Society in its reprint of the body of the  Oxford Reference Bible?    3. Is the Mormon Body, like the remainder of christendom,  universally & uniformly hostile (in sentiment) toward  all sectarian texts and margins?    I wish to say further, that my enquiries 
 back a little you will see that we   have been for several years past   calling for the Elders to go forth and  preach the Gospel, and we have  almost preached to all nations. There  may be some nations that we have   not preached to, but we have preached  it in France, Italy, Germany, and the   States of the German Confederacy;   and it has been preached in the   British Isles, in North and South  America, and the Society and Sand-  wich Islands, and to China, and we  have even sent them to the dark   regions of Asia and Africa to preach  the Gospel of Christ. There were  two of our brethren past through  here last night who have been to   those countries. Chauncey West has  been through that country and can   tell how it is there. Could he get   any converts there? Yes, if he could   get them plenty to eat, but if he  could not feed them and keep them   they would not stay with him. Now   Chauncey West has done as much as  he could, and not only preached and  travelled, but he has cleared his   skirts of those people among whom  he has travelled, and he has cleared  this people, for they have been   commanded to preach this Gospel to  all the nations of the earth.    Do we want to save the Lamanites?   Yes, we do, and they are here by   thousands and hundreds of thousands,  right upon this continent; we have   them all around us and they want   saving. Supposing we were to take  those Elders that we have in the   various nations and send them in  among these Indians, these natives  of the mountains, what would be the  result? Our Elders go and leave  their families for two, three, five  and seven years, they leave all   and travel by land and sea, they  get shipwrecked, go almost naked,  and be gone for years, preach-  ing and labouring year after year,  and what do they accomplish?   Not as much as they could do at  home in one month, but still they go,  and positively don't do as much good  as they could do at home in one  fourth the time. Now, suppose I  were to call for Missionaries to go  and preach the Gospel to the nations   that are termed the civilized nations, I   could get hundreds of volunteers. Why  are you not willing to make sacrifices  here? Why should not men be willing  to go and spend their time and talents  among these Lamanites and save time,  money, and hundreds and thousands of  dollars? Let a man till his garden,   attend to the cows, get his living and   devote the spare portion of his time   to preaching to these Lamanites, and  and he will be right at home all the  time. But men will prefer going and  spending their time year after year   among the Gentile nations, and   accomplish a mere nothing. And I  can find men in this congregation   who will do this, and do it freely,  but say to them set your own time  and go to the kanyon and get a load of  wood for these Lamanite squaws and  will they do it? No, they will not.  Is it not strange that men will act  so, go from home and spend hundreds  and thousands of dollars to preach  the Gospel to somebody of noted   civilization, away off yonder (pointing  east,) but will we go to the Laman-  ites? No, but we try to get away   off from them. We are treating   them just as the Latter-day Saints  have been treated by the Gentiles. If  any of them come about begging, the  Latter-day Saints instead of serving   them and thereby kindling a good   spirit within them say "here, get   out of the way, let this alone, and  don't you meddle with that, I don't  like you, go away from my house."  This is the way the Saints talk to   these natives. Now, where shall we   go—to the nations that have rejected  the fulness of the Gospel, or shall we   stay at home and preach to these

 times, Jesus gave his disciples to  understand that there was but one  Gospel. He told them what it was.   He declared unto them its ordi-  nances. He commissioned them  to preach the Gospel to every crea-  ture. In the first place they were   to preach faith in the Lord Jesus   Christ; next, repentance of sins;   next, baptism for the remission of  sins. Baptism was an ordinance   taught by the Savior himself. We  find, too, that He obeyed this ordi-  nance, being baptized in the river   Jordan by John the Baptist. Why?   To fulfill all righteousness. It was   a righteous law, and it was a type of  baptism to be followed by the whole  human family. "He that believeth   and is baptized shall be saved; but  he that believeth not shall be   damned." Such was the declaration  of the Savior to the twelve Apostles.  People were to be "buried with him  by baptism unto death: that like as   Christ was raised from the dead by  the glory of the Father, even so we   also should walk in newness of life."  What next? Men bearing the Mel-  chisedek Priesthood—Apostles and  Elders—had the authority to lay   hands upon baptized believers for  the reception of the Holy Ghost,  which they received and which led   them to prophecy of the things of   the kingdom of God; and the signs  followed those that believed. These  were the first principles of the Gos-  pel. And Paul the Apostle, makes  this declaration: "But though we,   or an angel from heaven, preach any  other Gospel than that which we  have preached unto you, let him   be accursed." He repeats this, and   goes on to tell us what the Gospel   is, and what the Church of Christ  is, and what it always has been.   In the Church were Apostles,   Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, Evange-  lists, etc., and these were "for the  perfecting of the Saints, for the  work of the ministry, for the edify-  ing of the body of Christ: till we all  come in the unity of the faith and  of the knowledge of the Son of God,  unto a perfect man, unto the mea-  sure of the stature of the fullness   of Christ." The Lord never had—  and never will have to the end of  time—a Church on the earth without  Prophets, Apostles, and inspired men.  Whenever the Lord had a people on   the earth that He acknowledged as   such, that people were led by reve-  lation. No man can find anything  contrary to this. When the Gos-  pel was given to the Jews, all the  gifts and graces and powers thereof,  accompanied it. It was accompanied   by the Eternal Priesthood—which   is after the order of the Son of God,  without which no man can ad-  minister in the ordinances of life  and salvation. The Savior was a   Jew himself. He came to His own  father's house, but they rejected   him and put him to death. The  Gospel was then taken from the Jews   and carried to the Gentiles. Paul   warned the Gentiles to take heed  lest they too fell into unbelief.   But the Gospel was delivered to  them with all its blessings and   powers, and remained with them as   long as there was a man upon the   earth that had the power to admin-  ister in its ordinances.    Now, have the Gentiles had that   church and kingdom of God in their  midst since the ancient Apostles  were put to death? I think not.   At the present time there are some  six hundred three score and six   different religions—different roads  to heaven and to hell—in the  world; but none of these bear much   resemblance to the Gospel as taught  by Jesus Christ and His Apostles.  The whole Christian world to-day  rises up against these Latter-day

 2 Britannia Chambers  Lawson St  London  England  May, 23rd 1892    To President Woodruff  The Tabernacle  Salt Lake City   U. S. A.    Reverend Sir    As a stranger I must apologise for taking the liberty of   addressing you but I am deputed by the to write this letter on behalf of the  wife and children of Brother Goalen a member and Elder of the Church of Latter   Day Saints, as it has been found impossible by his silence from gleaning any   intelligence from him.  Brother Goalen left London last May (1891) leaving behind his   wife and 5 little children (all under 12) including an infant of 5 months old.  Prior to his departure (which he had arranged and carried out very quickly) he faithfully   promised that he would send home regular weekly remittances so to maintain his wife   and family. This pledge he also gave me and he promised me on the word of a Christian that  he would redeem this pledge.  For some time he sent home monies, which I can vouch   myself were faithfully expended in purchasing food &c for the family.  About the fall  of last year these remittances gradually fell away likewise letters.  The wife finding herself   in this position had to seak what scant labor she could, her own trade as an army   accoutrement maker having fallen off.  The worry of this and seeing her home  gradually having to be sold to meet her rent soon told upon her, and, as I feared,   has now so undermined her health, as to utterly prostrate her and incapacitate her   from again following (for a long time at least) any employment, consequently   the family are now starving.  The last remnant of furniture that would realise any   cash was very reluctantly sold to a dealer, viz a piano which fetched only 8 pounds.  With care this sum was laid out to pay rent, furing and food for 17 weeks through   the late bitter winter.  Mrs Goalen finding she can get no response to her letters and the   situation being a painful one has compelled her to ask me to appeal to you on her behalf  believing that you will as a Christian gentleman try and bring the errant husband   to the knowledge of the grave position of those he has so cruelly deserted in this great City.  I now   on their behalf ask you Sir to immediately use your best endeavors to compell Brother Goalen   to communicate with his family and to do that which he has an undoubted  right to  do  I as their advocate shall indeed be pleased to know that your kind efforts have borne   good fruit and that I as the humble writer of this epistle have only done my duty.  I might add that any plea made by Brother Goalen leaving them a good home is no set off   to his silence.  The wages of "Smith's" in your City are well known here and he told his wife that he  could easily earn £ 5 a week. half of which sum he would send her.  The only stray news   the wife has gleaned in 6 months was in a letter sent to a relative wherein it was  stated he had gone South.  The facts I have stated are literally true and now

 natives? I tell you, if we send this  people off from us and treat them  with contempt we shall regret it, and   mourn because of it. I am going to   tell you what to do with these natives,  you Bishops and Presidents of Provo   and Springville, call out those teams   which you have about you, all of   them, and if these Indians want   wood, haul it for them for you have  burned theirs, and they need a little  wood as well as you. Let them have  feed on the range for their horses,   wood to burn, and then they will let  you alone. You will eat their fish   too, on which they depend for a   living one part of the year, and   every service berry that you can  find in the mountains, and still   you grumble to let them have   a little with you. You don't want  the crickets, and therefore they  can have the whole of them, but  you have secured the antelope and   everything else that you could make  any kind of use of. Before the whites  came, there was plenty of fish and ante-  lope, plenty of game of almost every  description; but now the whites have  killed off these things, and there is   scarcely anything left for the poor  natives to live upon. Brethren what   are you going to do with them?   Kick them out of doors when they   come in and let them starve to   death? If we do this, we shall most  assuredly regret it. Well, what will  you do brother Brigham? I will   tell you what I will do; there is  brother Armstrong here, and he is an   agent, and I want him to set off a   piece of land for the natives and  make a division line, and have it  clearly understood that they are not  to intrude upon your ground, nor you  upon theirs. In addition to this, make  a road from their land, so that when   they want to come to the city they   can do it without breaking down   fences or intruding upon anybody's  land. Then teach them to work, to   fence in their land, to plough, to raise  wheat and corn, and potatoes, and   everything they need; teach them to  be cleanly and industrious, and prevail  on them to send their children to   school to learn to read and write the  English language, and let some of   those men that used to talk of   teaching the Lamanites, and of con-  verting them, let them go down and  build a nice school-house in their   settlement, and there teach them the  principles of civilization. And instead  of you wasting your hundreds and  thousands worth of time, and of grain,   and clothing, do as they did in Salt  Lake City last year; they formed a   society for the benefit of these   Indians, and put their means together  and made them clothing of various  kinds, and distributed those articles  which they were enabled to obtain  among the Lamanites, and do you go  and do likewise. Gather up the yarn,   and the cotton yarn, and woollen   yarn, and make them up into  clothes to make them comfort-  able. But they must work for   those things; teach them to work  for all they have and don't encourage  the idle, those who refuse to work.   In this way you will gradually bring  them in to civilization, and they will  be convinced that you are their friends,  and that you intend to do them good,  and these things will lead them to   give ear to the Gospel and be bap-  tized for the remission of their sins.  Now are we going to try to make   them one, and encourage them to   abide here in peace, or are we   determined to drive them from us?  I can tell you the Lamanites of these  mountains will yet be a shield to this  people if we do right, and if we will   not do our duty, our necks are ready  for the halter or the knife; yes, you   will find that our necks will be ready  for the knives of our enemies, if we   do not look to these poor degraded   natives. 
 G. S. L. City Decem. 9, 1856.    Elder E. Snow    Dear bro.    I desire to drop you a few lines as the  mail East goes out in the morning.    The Reformation is going on in Israel with  mutch warmth and stedfastness, the Missionaries in this city are  taking an active part in preaching to, and stirring up the people.    Prest. J. M. Grant went forward in this Reformation  as an angel of God in the midst of his brethren, and with a  loud voice proclaimed repentance in the ears of this people &  made every exertion possible to get the people to live their religion.  his labours were so unceasing that he brought his body down to  the grave. He died on the 1st inst after about two weeks  illness of chills & fever, then bilious fever, terminating in lung  Fever. ^he was buried on the 4th. with military honors.^ He is much lamented in Israel, but now lamented  for his own sake, for we know it is well with Jedediah    The last hand cart Coy. arrived nNov 30 which  relieved our feelings greatly. Many have suffered much having  frozen their feet, hands, & limbs. The expense of this years  emigration to us is immense, besides the suffering &   exposing of the lives of our brethren who have gone to the  rescue of the Companies.    The last Coy. are at Bridger; and about 60  4 horse teams have gone out to bring them in, with about  30 or 40 tons of flour.    Bro. Franklin & myself are all of the Quorum  who are now in the valley, & the Presidency having put the  Missionaries under our control, we feel that the responsibility  upon us at this time requires us to live near the Lord  that his grace may be sufficient for us.    Praying that you and the brethren of our  Quorum ^abroad^ may have the power & blessing of God to rest  abundantly upon you for the salvation & gathering of  Israel & desiring an interest in your prayers. 
 unless some reparation is not immediately made   by Brother Goalen the wife will, by the advice of her   friends, adopt a course that will not, I fear,   be a pleasant one.  But I have no doubt myself  that a perfectly amicable arrangement can be made  through your good offices and you can rest assurred   that you will be rewarded by the gratitude of an   honest hard working woman and family.    Personally I have no feeling in the matter, other than   that which prompts the strong to champion the cause   of the weak and defenceless.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box, B.    Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 26, 1893    Dear Brother Atkins:    I received your interesting letter of Nov. 16th,  but through the multiplicity of business the answer has been delayed.  I also got letters from Brother Thompsen upon the same subject of the  boiler and pipes, and am pleased that they are doing so well and are  satisfactory. Brother Ottenger made some big mistake in his calculation  about that water system; I hope it will do all right now.    We are having some curious times here of late. About the  time our State Bill passed the House with only five opposing votes, the  Clergymen of Utah met, and when Mr. McNiece made a motion to telegraph to  Washington, as clergymen, to oppose our State Government, two-thirds of  those present voted against him, saying they had had war enough and now  wanted a State Government. At the same time the Liberals met, dug a  grave and buried all their Liberal sentiments, and both parties sent  strong telegrams to Washington for State Government. Unless there is  some great change, it looks now as though Utah would soon become a   State.    President Cannon has just returned from New York where he  has been a short time on Church business. We are all well as usual; I  think I feel better than I did before I was sick. I think your account  of David Milne is quite enough. Remember me to your family and to my  freiends.    Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff 
 Saints because they profess to be-  lieve in revelation, in Prophets and   Apostles. This has been the case   ever since the organization of this  Church. De we teach anything   that is contrary to the laws of God?  We do not. Do we believe any-  thing that is contrary to the Gospel   as taught in the days of the Apostles?   We do not. "But," says one,  "how did you come by this Gospel?"   We came by it through the ad-  ministration of an angel from God.  John the Revelator, in speaking of   the last day—the opening of the   seals—the blowing of the trumpets  —and all that should transpire be-  fore the second coming of the Son  of Man—said he saw (among other  things) "another angel fly in the  midst of heaven, having the ever-  lasting Gospel to preach unto them   that dwell on the earth, and to every  nation, and kindred, and tongue,   and people, saying with a loud   voice, Fear God and give glory to  him, for the hour of his judgment  is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] When the angel of God   delivered this message to Joseph   Smith he told him the heavens were  full of judgments; that the Lord  Almighty had set his hand to estab-  lish the kingdom that Daniel saw   and prophesied about, as recorded  in the ##Daniel 2:26-47|second chapter## of Daniel;  and that the Gospel had to be  preached to all nations under heaven   as a witness to them before the end   should come, and that, too, in fulfill-  ment of the revelation of God,  as given here in the Old and New   Testaments. Joseph Smith never   attempted to organize this Church   until he received commandment so  to do from God. He never attempted  to baptize a man until he received   the Aaronic Priesthood under   the hands of John the Baptist (who  was beheaded for the word of God   and the testimony of Jesus). [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8##] He  never attempted to officiate in any   of the ordinances of the Gospel  until he received the Apostleship   under the hands of Peter, James  and John. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##] These men appeared   to him. They laid their hands upon  his head and sealed the Apostleship  upon him with all the power thereof.  And these angels told Joseph Smith   to go forth himself and to call upon   other men to go forth unto the world  and preach the Gospel as taught by   Jesus Christ and the Apostles, and   the Lord would back up their testi-  mony; that when they laid hands  upon those who had been baptized  for the remission of sins, and who   had received their testimony, they  should receive the Holy Ghost.  This was the proclamation to   Joseph Smith 53 years ago.    Now, I want to ask this assembly,   strangers and Latter-day Saints  alike, what position the Elders of  Israel would have been in when   they went forth and made this   promise to the inhabitants of the  earth—the promise that if they  would receive of our testimony,  repent of their sins and be baptized   for a remission of them, and have  hands laid upon them, they should  receive the Holy Ghost—I want to   ask, gentlemen and ladies, how long  those Elders would have taught   this principle in the nations of the  earth if God Almighty had not  backed up their testimony? How  long would it have been, in the  absence of this backing, until they  would have been found out to   be deceivers? Not a great while.  Is there another set of men on the  face of the earth to-day, that dare   to go forth and make that proclama-  tion to the world? No; because  unless they were called of God to   make it, He would not back up their  testimony, and it would be known  who they were. 
 for while Starvation is knocking at   the doors, the head of the family, to drown   his sorrows, will spend his hard Earned  pittance in beer cellars ^and^ whiskey rooms,   & still more loathsome places are sought  to bury consciousness of the family's suf  ferings. May the Lord Speed the day when   his people will all be gathered home  away from Such Scenes.    The best season for   Missionary labors has now Commenced,  in view of which an additional force   of Elders will be placed in the field  to distribute tracksts & open the way   for Meetings to be held.    With abundant aid   from the Saints in Utah, we have been   able to swell the list of our Emigration   from Scandinavia to the number of 650  Souls ^this season^ & there are already prospects for   a few for next year.
