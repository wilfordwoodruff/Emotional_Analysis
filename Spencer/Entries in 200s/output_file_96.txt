 Elder Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference, on thenecessity for union, in faith and practice, among the Saints. When difficulties occurthey should be settled between the parties concerned or by the Teachers and not suffered togo farther. We were engaged in a great work, but with the blessings of the Lord, wecould accomplish all that was required of us, if we were united. If our partwas faithfully performed here, we would, not only, have great satisfaction in re-viewing our earthly career, but would be regarded by our dead friends as their saviors

 But the gospel word condems themShows a meek & lowly wayTravelers few but Christ defends themWhile they strive to watch & prayThes though few are bound for heavenSelf denying humble lowKnowing all their sins forgivenPersecuted here belowLord the number keep increasingThough the beast may rage & warAnd thy Kingdom without ceasing Grow & spread from shore to shoreHireling priests are sore tormentedfor their craft in danger standsEvery plot has been inventedTo uphold their popish plans 
 Elder  Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Conference, beartestimony to the remarks of Elder Orson Pratt. He felt that if thispeople did not repent, the judgements of the Lord were at their doorBoth the living and the dead were looking to this people to do awork for them and if the Saints neglected their duties their bloodwould be answered upon the heads of this people.

To com-mence with you say you are glad that I am not at home for one reason and that is because of Politics. I think as you do Pa that it is a shame for our people to letthese matters of this kind stir them up to such an extent. A great many people Pawho are good Latter day Saints cannot understan[d]how it is that the Apostles take part in Politics. Not that these matters worry mein the least for I am not a member of either of them, I thank the Lord to say & thinkthat I shall take the stand of a nonpartisianNo one can deny but that both parties are wrong. They both have something good & more bad. Not that I wish to critisize any of our apostles but politics and religion don't go welltogether.

 two men could leave the Political Areana and continue their work in a church capasity without unkind feelings towards one another. This may be possible but I don't think so. It strikes me very strongly that there must be enough for our apostles to do to keep matters in the church in running order without dabbling in the "political Dish." You may have an object in allowing these apostles to enter into Politic's & suppo[se]with out a doubt you have or else you wouldnot allow it. Prehaps I had no business to remarkmention such a thing but it is my belief that the people would honor you all the more if you would forbid your apostles from taking any hand in these matters. You will forgiveme I hope for saying any such thing and my only reason for making such remarks is that the matter is not entirely clear to me.There are so many things I want to ask you about in a religious way.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTSP. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T.  August 15th, 1889.Elder William Atkin,Atkinville.Dear Brother: I am busy as ever and have not therefore time to write a lengthy letter in reply to your favor of the 28th of July. I was very pleased to hear from you, and that all was well with you. My health at present is quite good. You are very fortunate in having plenty of water in that part of the country. We are still suffering for the want of this necessary element.We have had one or two slight showers of rain lately, but not enough to lay the dust. The weather still continues very hot, and everything almost is burning up. It is said that this is the hottest season ever known in Salt Lake. I see that you also have had a share of it.Our election passed off quietly. The result shows to us that the People's Party in this City will have to be very wide awake and cast every vote they have in order to save the city at the next election. Our people have been rather careless and indifferent in the past in political matters. Now they have got to arouse themselves and do all to their power to prevent our opponents from gaining the ascendency.Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have just returned from a trip to Bear Lake Stake. We held conference there with the people, and had a very enjoyable time. The people of that Stake have just erected a very fine tabernacle—about the best in the Territory, outside of Salt Lake. We have also attended conferences

I expect to start next Monday for Canada, to be gone three or four weeks.All send love. Alice often speaks of you and the family, as does Emma. All wish to be remembered to you and your family.

Yesterday we kept the 4th of July by going up to Wasatch, in Little Cotton-wood Canyon, the place where we have quarried and are quarrying the rock forour temple.  Our brethren have built quite a little village there, composedof tents and small cabins, and planted very nice flower gardens and walks, andbrought the water through the village.  We had a very interesting day.  Therewere about thhree hundred persons present.  We had speeches and various enter-tainments, and a feast.  We visited the stone quarry, which I was deeply inter-ested in.  Rocks twice the size of your house are being split up into blocsks ofthe finest granite in the world.  I was very much surprised to see their mannerof operation.  They drill holes in the side of a rock fifty feet high and drive inlittle wedges which split it straight open, and they then cut it up into blocks.I am glad that you are doing so well in your graeinharvest.

Iwill make known unto thee my will concern-ing the nations who encumber the land ofpromise, and also concerning Zion and herinhabitants. I have already revealed mywill concerning the nation through the mouthof my servant Joseph, who sealed his testimonywith his own blood, which testimony has beenin force upon all the world from the hour ofhis death. What I the Lord have revealedin that testament and decreed upon the nation,and upon all the nations of the earth, shallbe fulfilled, saith the Lord of hosts. I theLord have spoken and will be obeyed. My purposes shall be fulfilled upon this nation,and no power shall stay my hand. The hour is at the door when my wrath and in-dignation will be poured out upon the wick-ed of the nations. Their murders, blas-phemies, lyings, whoredoms, and abomina-tions have come up before my face andbefore the heavens, and the wrath of mineindignation is full. I have decreedplagues to go forth and waste mine ene-

 The ordinance of the Lord's supper being attended to, elder Woodruff rose to state his motives for leaving England. His family were scattered; he had one child in the State of Maine, and an aged father and mother in Connecticut, and another child in Nauvoo, he could not think of the church leaving the United States, and these portions remain ungathered. If Israel was justified in taking up the bones of Joseph, surely he was so in taking his living father and mother and children from the midst of Babylon. It was therefore a sense of duty which called him away, and caused him to bid farewell to his friends in this land. It will of course be necessary for this conference to take a vote on the presidency in Britain. My re-turn is hastened, the work is hastened. It has ever seemed to me that the Lord has driven me onward in his work. I have, comparatively speaking, been compelled to do the work of five years in one. I have printed the book of Doctrine and Covenants also the Proclamation, which would not certainly have been done, had not circum-stances and the schemes of the enemy prompted it much sooner. I have visited many conferences, but not so many as I could have wished. I have inquired of the Lord respecting my departure, and I can come to no other conclusion than to adopt this course. I feel now that the time has come, after travelling 60,000 miles, and crossing the ocean three times, to go and gather with my brethren. There is strength in Britain and in British laws. That day is past in America. I am an American citizen and have a right to speak my sentiments; so long as you are pro-tected by British laws, and are afforded equal rights with her other subjects, I say respect those laws, and be subject unto them. I love the land of my birth, and I love her laws, but not the mal-administration of them, for many of her rulers, are guilty of great injustice towards the Saints, and the judgment of God hangs over them. I hope then, that what I have stated will suffice in justification of my leaving you. It will, therefore, in the first place, be my duty to adjust matters with regard to the presidency, and I feel to recommend to your notice elder Reuben Hedlock to preside over the church in Britain, which was unanimously carried.Elder Woodruff also recommended elder Thomas Ward as his first counsellor, which was also carried unanimously.Elder Woodruff said he had another proposition to make with respect to another counsellor. He had asked the Lord upon this subject, and he would nominate elder John Banks to act as second counsellor unto the presidency, which was carried unanimously.Elder Woodruff remarked that we had been expecting elders who had received their endowment to arrive in this country, but they now might not come, but pro-bably go to the seed of Jacob in the West; but I trust there is sufficient wisdom and talent here to carry on the work. It is for you to rise up as men of God, that your course may be onward and increasing. Remember that the kingdom is rising in the West, that their eyes will be upon you, and their ears to listen to the report of your welfare. We have to lead the people there, and we have a great work to do. I remember the words of our beloved prophet; on one occasion he said, "I have one of the most important proclamations to make to you that God as yet given: as soon as the elders get their endowments, they may go both through North and South America, and build up stakes of Zion, as far as doors are open." We now leave the temple and city, as a stake and a monument of the industry and sacrifice of the Saints, at least until the indignation and judgments of God are past over. Any nation acting as America has done, in withholding justice, in refusing to defend her citizens from violence and death, will be punished, and is ripe for the judgments of God; and rest assured, brethren, that the church in the wilderness will look unto this portion of the church to assist and uphold them. 
 unto you, mine apostles, I also say unto my servantsthe seventies, the high priests, the elders, the priests,and all my servants who are pure in heart and whohave borne testimony unto the nations. Let themgo forth and cleanse their feet in pure water, andbear testimony of it unto their Father who is inheaven. And then, saith the Lord unto mineapostles and mine elders, when ye do these things withpurity of heart, I the Lord will hear your prayer andam bound by oath and covenant to defend you andfight your battles. As I have said in a formercommandment, it is not my will that mine eldersshould fight the battles of Zion, for I will fight your bat-tles. Nevertheless, let no man be afraid to lay downhis life for my sake, for he that layeth down his life formy sake shall find it again and have eternal life. The nation is ripened in iniquity, and the cup ofthe wrath of mine indignation is full, and I will notstay my hand in judgments upon this nation, or thenations of the earth. I have decreed wars and judge-ments upon the wicked, and my wrath and indigna-tion are about to be poured out upon them, and thewicked and rebellious shall know that I am God. As I the Lord have spoken, so will I fulfill. I willspare none who remain in Babylon, but I will burnthem up, saith the Lord of hosts. As I the Lord

 Elder Woodruff then rose to lay his own individual case before the meeting. Many inquiries had been made about emigration, and other things. I have a sub-ject to lay before the meeting concerning my leaving. I wish to say that since I have been in Liverpool, I have been engaged in publishing the Doctrine and Cove-nants, and the Proclamation. The Hymn Book had been published before. I cannot feel to leave without settling my accounts honourably; no one shall say that we do not do justly with all men. We have on hand some 1500 Hymn Books, some 700 or upwards Books of Mormon, and about 2000 Covenants. I have about fifteen days to arrange matters in. By letter, received from Brigham Young, they determine to deliver the entire people, who will number at least from fifteen to twenty thousand souls. These have to be provided for with food for some twelve months, waggons, &c., and means to travel, and it will be a mighty struggle to deliver all the people, but they have determined to make the sacrifice. In Missouri, when the edict went forth for the extermination of the Saints, multitudes sacri-ficed all things, in order to assist each other. We want the Saints in Britain, therefore, to assist us in this migration. The temple has yet to be finished, and until the spring the tithing will be gathered, and I should be glad to take as much with me as I can. Perhaps our friends may say, that there have been a many calls for money, and so has it been in America, there has been a continual drain upon the Saints, by the many vexatious lawsuits which they have had to meet, as well as other things. The British Saints have come forward nobly, when called upon to assist the brethren in the building of the Temple. Some £220 has been do-nated since we called for assistance for the bell and clock; this is well, and I feel convinced that you will continue your efforts. I should wish the Saints, during the winter, to continue their exertions, when, afterwards, there will not be the same call upon their benevolence. It will be evident to all, that with the quantity of books on hand, that we should be glad to dispose of some of them, and the authorities in Nauvoo wish us to procure all we can on these things, and if any will loan money on the books, the presidency will refund the same, as soon as the necessary bills thereon are discharged. I now call upon the Saints, in the name of humanity, in the name of the Lord, and in the name of a suffering people, if there are any that can assist to do it—if any can lend money on our books to do it, not for any individual profit, but to assist in the great work that lies before us. And again, if any wish to render me any personal assistance to enable me to carry my family from the east to Nauvoo, to procure me a waggon and team, and necessaries for the journey, it will be most gratefully received, and as a servant of God I make this appeal, and leave it with you to act upon such measures as you think fit, and God will help you according to the extent of your means and intentions in aid-ing his great work. 
 Elder Woodruff then rose and said, that it was with no ordinary feelings that he stood before them on the present occasion. He was labouring under severe indispo-sition; the spirit was indeed willing, but the flesh was weak; he trusted, however,that the assembly would be as still as possible, while he endeavoured to make a fewremarks. He had never seen any period of the church when his feelings weremore satisfied than at present, the veil was beginning to be withdrawn and presentscenes of glory and intelligence. Every hostile movement of the enemy at firstlooked dark, but that darkness was quickly dispelled, and brighter scenes of truthwere speedily made manifest. The first news of the present movement certainly was like a cloud passing over the mind, which however speedily vanished, and it willeventually result in showing forth the power of God. We wish to lay before youthe causes of calling this conference. Our brethren and sisters, the Saints, afterbeing driven from their abodes, and hunted from Missouri, seemed as though theyhad found a resting place in the state of Illinois; there, by their industry, they hadbuilt up a large city and a temple, with several adjoining stakes; but the hand ofoppression and persecution is again upon them, and they are compelled, under thealternative of death and destruction, to emigrate and seek an asylum in the wilder-ness, beyond the Rocky Mountains. Some may suppose that the present removalwas a great trial—that is true, but the Saints were the people to endure that trial.The time has come for Jacob to be the head and not the tail. Many have consi-dered Nauvoo as the only settlement of the Saints, but the idea has been too limited.Nauvoo has been a nursery, where the plants of the kingdom of God have been set;but in the course of time those plants want spreading, in order that they mayarrive at full growth and proper maturity. And now when the Saints cannotremain any longer, they are willing to go. This is also necessary in order that thejudgments of God might be poured out upon that guilty nation that is alreadydrunk with the blood of the Saints. The church must come out from the midst ofthe Gentiles. Therefore we feel a satisfaction in this. We have built stakes, weare willing to sacrifice and leave them. We have suffered our prophets to be mur-

 PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO, AND HELPING THE LAMANITES.OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL.Remarks by Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, in the Bowery at Provo,July 15, 1855.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.I have sat and listened with a greatdeal of interest to the teachings of the Prophets and Apostles of theLord, and I feel it to be a privilege,indeed, to enjoy the society of suchmen, to hear them speak, and to havea few moments with the rest to address you. In the subjects and items that have been presented before us, there is a great amount of import-ant matter. I have felt, and did in the commencement of this Conference,that for one man or several men to have oil enough in their vessels to supply one thousand men was a verydifficult thing, but it seems neces-sary when a congregation comestogether for all to have oil in theirlamps, and not to require one or half-a-dozen men to have oil withthem for the whole congregation.Well, brethren and sisters, we have heard a great deal since this meeting commenced, on various subjects, andwe have had good teachings—prin-ciples of eternal life have been set before us by the several brethren who have spoken. The proceedings of this Conference have led my mind to reflection. I have reflected upon whatI have heard, and considered the im-portance of those teachings we have received; and there is one thing Iwant to say to this congregation,when the servants of God who have been set to lead us, or to lead the 
 THE DESERET NEWS. 379REMARKSOn the death of Elder Ezra T. Benson, byElder WILFORD WOODRUFF, de-livered in the New Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Sept. 5th, 1869.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.I am called upon this afternoon to make some remarks upon the life and death of Brother Ezra Taft Benson, who has been suddenly taken out of our midst,—from time into eternity.I have long since considered it unneces-sary to make any excuses for performing my duty upon any occasion in public; but if there is any position where a man might have doubts about satisfying his own mind or the minds of his friends, perhaps it is on an occasion like this. It is well known, at least to the Latter-day Saints, that the eldersof Israel rise to speak without any written sermon or preparation of any kind. Many of us have been engaged, the greater portion of our lives, in preaching the gospel to the world, and on every occasion we depend for assistance and preparation upon the spirit of God. This is my position this af-ternoon. I rise before you with no prepared sermon, and with no particular principles that I have settled in my mind to address you upon; depending, as on all occasions, upon the spirit of God and the faith and prayers of my friends. This dispen-sation of Providence causes me many reflections; and I presume it is the case with every Latter-day Saint pres-ent. In the first place I will ask the question what position did Bro. Benson occupy while in the flesh, and how many have ever held the same position on the face of the earth. The words contained in the ##Isaiah 52:7|7th verse of the 52nd chapter## of the pro-phecies of Isaiah are brought to my mind. While contemplating the great work of building up the Zion of God in the last days he says:"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!"What position can any man occupy on the face of the earth that is more noble, God-like, high and glorious than to be a messen-ger of salvation unto the human family? What more responsible position can a man occupy than to be an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ? I do not know of any in this or any other generation. The thought also arises in my mind how many individuals have ever held this position on the earth? I find in the history recorded in the Bible, from the days of Adam down through the different dispensations and generations, that prophets have existed on the earth. Adam, himself, was a prophet and he or-dained his sons to the Melchizedec priest-hood; the gospel of Christ was taught to him after the Fall, and he attended to the or-dinances of the house of God. He was a high priest and, as a high priest, held the keys of the Kingdom of God. There were many sons who were High Priests, having been ordained to this office by their father Adam. Three years before his death he called together Seth, Enos, Jared, Cainan, Mahaleel, Methusaleh and many other of his descendants in the Valley of Adam-Ondi-Ahman, and there rose up and blessed them with his great and last patriarchal blessing. This has been given to us by revelation; and these men were prophets and high priests. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##]Tracing down the sacred history through the different ages and dispensations we learn that many prophets existed among the children of men. Moses was a law-giver in Israel and held the office of a prophet, seer and revelator. When I say that many prophets have existed, it proba-bly needs some qualification. The number of persons thus honored of God has not been many when compared with the whole of the people who have lived; but in every gospel age and dispensation God has had His prophets and servants upon the earth to make known His will to its inhabitants. In the days of Moses elders were chosen, as His counselors; and seventy elders were ordained to bear record of the things of God and to assist Moses in the work to be performed in his day; but we do not read of apostles being chosen under Moses's dis-pensation. [##Numbers 11:16-17##] Jesus tabernacled in the flesh to establish the Kingdom of His Father up-on the earth, and when he was thirty yearsof age he went forth administering in theordinances of the house of God, and he chose twelve Apostles to assist him, and he gave to them the keys of the Kingdom of God. [##Matthew 10:1-4##] And the highest office that any man has ever held on the face of the earth in this or any other generation is that of an apos-tle.We read that God set in His church first, apostles, then prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, gifts, graces and helps; and the office of an apostle entitles him to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God; and what he binds on earth is bound in heaven, and what he looses on earth is loosed in heaven. The history of the Twelve whom Jesus chose is to be found in the New Testa-ment; within the lids of that book their travels, the course they pursued and the doctrines they taught are published to the world. Nearly the whole of them sealed their testimony with their blood. Some were crucified as their master was; some were beheaded; and all except John suffered martyrdom in some way for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. This was the fate of the first quor-um of Apostles we have any history of.After the death and resurrection of the Savior, when he ministered to his disci-ples the last time on earth, He informed them that he had other sheep not of this fold whom He was going to visit and min-ister unto. [##John 10:16##] The Book of Mormon is a record of the descendants of the House of Israel who dwelt on this continent an-ciently. It gives us the history of the Jar-edites who came from the Tower of Babel; of Lehi and his family, who came from Je-rusalem and also of the Lamanites and Ne-phites, the descendants of Nephi and Lem-uel, sons of Lehi. In that record we find that Christ, after His death and resurrec-tion, visited that branch of the house of Is-rael which dwelt on this continent. [##3 Nephi 11:1-17##] On the occasion of that visit we are informed that Jesus chose Twelve Apostles and gave to them the same power, keys, gifts and gra-ces that He had given to His apostles on the eastern continent; and they went forth, and magnified their callings. [##3 Nephi 12:1##] All of this quorum of the Twelve Apostles had the promise of departing and being with Christ when they were seventy-two years old, except three of them. To these three Jesus gave a promise similar to that which He gave to John the Revelator,—namely, that they should tarry in the flesh until He came. [##3 Nephi 28:4-12##] History informs us that the wicked tried to kill John in various ways, placing him on one occasion, in a cauldron of boil-ing oil, but his life was preserved; and that finally, in the reign of Domitian Caesar, he was banished to the Isle of Patmos to work in the lead mines. [##Revelation 1:9##] While there he was blessed with visions, revelations, know-ledge, light and truth, a portion of which we have recorded in what are called the Reve-lations of St. John. In the reign of Nerva John was recalled, and afterwards wrote his epistles. The first quorum of Apostles were all put to death, except John, and we are informed that he still remains on the earth, though his body has doubtless un-dergone some change. Three of the Ne-phites, chosen here by the Lord Jesus as His Apostles, had the same promise—that they should not taste death until Christ came, and they still remain on the earth in the flesh. [##3 Nephi 28:4-12##]Thus we have an account in the B[ible]and Book of Mormon of but two quorums of Twelve Apostles being chosen previous to this dispensation; but in these last days the Lord called upon Joseph Smith, gave him power and authority to organize His church and kingdom again upon the earth and gave him the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdom of God. Jo-seph was ordained to the apostleship under the hands of men holding the keys of the kingdom of God in the days of Jesus,—namely, Peter, James and John. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##]I shall not occupy time with entering into the details of these things. I have re-ferred to them to show the importance of the office held by Brother Benson. He was a member of one of the three quorums of Apostles that have ever been chosen on the face of the earth since Jesus Christ tab-ernacled in the flesh, that we have any knowledge of. The first chosen when Je-sus commenced his public labors in the flesh; the second after his resurrection, here on this continent, and the third, since the revelation of the gospel in our own day. Here we find only thirty-six men, chosen at various times and dispensations, in six thousand years, to hold this order of Priest-hoo, unless they were chosen in the days of Enoch and at times in which the Bible does not inform us. This number has been increased, however, by others who have been chosen to fill vacancies in these quo-rums as in the case of Judas, and others; but it is safe to say that the entire number who have held this office from the days of Adam until to-day has been very limited. As to the number of inhabitants who have dwelt on the earth during that period it is a pretty difficult matter to form any correct idea in relation to it; I do not think that any statistician could tell this to any de-gree of correctness. It is a kind of a given point in these days to say that the popula-tion of the earth is about a thousand mil-lions, and that this number pass away every generation. It is also estimated that about three generations pass away in a century; this gives three thousand millions in a cen-tury, thirty thousand millions in a thousand years, and one hundred and eighty thou-sand millions in six thousand years,—about the period that is supposed to have elapsed since the creation of man upon the earth. Whether these statistics are any-thing like correct it is not of much impor-tance to discuss; but it is an important re-flection that Brother Benson, who has been associated with us so many years, is one of the chosen few, of all the immense num-bers who have dwelt on the face of the earth, who have been called to hold the office of apostles. Well might the prophet say, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet," &c. [##Isaiah 52:7##]I will say that in my boyhood while at-tending Sabbath school in my native State, Connecticut, there seemed something glo-rious, to me, about the Apostles of Jesus Christ who were called to preach the gos-pel of the Son of God to the inhabitants of the earth; and I have many times felt that I would willingly walk a thousand miles to see a prophet, an Apostle or any man called of God, who could teach me the way to be saved; a man who held in his hands the power of the Priesthood, who could com-mand the elements and they would obey him, and who could declare the words of life in their truth and purity to the inhab-itants of the earth. I always looked upon the lives and missions of these men, though despised by the world generally, as the most important of any men who ever dwelt in the flesh. Jesus himself was called master of the house of Beelzebub, and trav-elled through a constant scene of poverty, ridicule, persecution and affliction; yet there was something great, good, grand and glorious in the life of the Savior of the world. This was the fate of Him and His apostles; and though they descended below all things they held in their hands the des-tiny and salvation, not only of that genera-tion but of all the human race; and woe be to that house, nation, kindred, tongue or people who rejected their words and testi-mony, for they will rise in judgment against them.From the days of my childhood until I heard the fulness of the gospel, as taught by the Latter-day Saints, I had a great desire to live to see a prophet or apostle. I have lived to see this day. I have lived to see the church and kingdom of God on the earth, with all its gifts, graces, power, glory and dominion, revealed and organ-ized by the ministrations of angels fromGod in heaven and by the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have lived to see apostles and the full organization of the priesthood again officiating in and adminis-tering the ordinances of salvation to thechildren of men.Brother Ezra T. Benson, whose death has occurred so unexpectedly, was one of the few called in this day to bear testimony to the nations of the earth of the restoration of this gospel, and he has traveled many thousand miles to do so. He has been true and faithful unto death, and he will receive a crown of life. He has gone from our midst to the spirit world to mingle with the Gods, or at least with his brethren who have gone before him; whether he will mingle with the Gods until after the resur-rection perhaps it is not for me to say. He has gone home to receive his reward. What a cloud of reflection it brings to the mind! It speaks in loud language to every apostle,

 dered without resistance, and in no case has resistance been offered, save accordingto law and at the command thereof. We are by no means discouraged, we lookupon these things as the fulfilment of the word of the Lord. Next spring willpresent such a scene as has not been witnessed scarcely since the exodus of theIsraelites from the land of Egypt. I am perfectly willing that these things shouldbe, and that America should have the credit of banishing so many of her citizensfrom her midst for conscience' sake. There is no safety under the government ofthe United States. It is time to go where we can enjoy our rights, and no longerbe hemmed in, but be placed where Jacob's nobles shall be of themselves, and theirgovernors shall proceed from the midst of them.—##Jeremiah 30:21|Jer. xxx. 21##. I rejoice, then,more than at any other time. Let America go ahead with her present measures,but let the Saints arise and go out of her midst. If we are called to makesacrifices, the Saints are the people that can make them. 
 testimony.Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF boretestimony to the remarks alreadymade. The Lord raised up this work,through the Prophet Joseph Smith,who labored for its establishmentand predicted many things, all ofwhich thus far have been fulfilled,and there is no doubting the factthat all that remains will be in duetime. I have witnessed the progressof this work for many years, and have gone through the trials and ex-periences of early times, and whenI see this people to-day numbering ahundred and fifty thousand, I seethe hand of God among them, I feel interested in the youth, becauseI look to them to bear off this workin triumph. Many of the older au-thorities have passed away. Josephis gone, Brigham is gone, and othersare following. When I think of thehardships they and many of us havepassed through, traveling withoutpurse of scrip—shouldering ourknapsacks, leaving families andfriends for the truth's sake, I some-times am led to exclaim, Whereoh God, are the children of the pro-phets, who have the stamina toshoulder the responsibility of thekingdom, and bear it off as theirfathers have done. Yet they arehere, before and around me in therising generation. To them it willbe given and God will preserve amongthem those that will sustain his work. I want to see the young men and women instructed aright. We are responsible for this, and should doall in our power to train them in the principles of righteousness. I wouldlike to see the name of every young man in Israel enrolled in the YoungMen's Associations, and every younglady a member of their Associations,that they may all be gaining intelli-gence and learning of the things ofGod. I hope they will heed thecounsels of their elders and avoidtemptation. This people were or-dained before they were born tocome forth in this generation and dothe work they are doing. I wouldrather not live another hour than tolive so long that I should lose thefellowship of the Saints of God, orbe estranged from the spirit of ourreligion. I have an anxiety aboutthese associations. They are doinga good work in preparing young menfor the field that is before them. Iwas never called to perform a mis-sion in my life but what I was gladof it, after I got through, no matterwhat the circumstances were beforegoing or while I was away. Wehave adopted some general instruc-tions to the Associations, which Brother Junius F. Wells will nowread. 
 times, concerning my Church which has been called outof the wilderness of darkness and error, concerningthe Zion and kingdom of God, and concerning Babylonthe Great, and what I have spoken through the mouthof my servant Joseph, shall all be fulfilled. Andthough heaven and earth pass away, my words shallnot pass away, but shall be fulfilled, saith the Lord.These revelations and testimonies are beforeyou. Let my Saints search the word of the Lord, and treasure up wisdom, and be prepared for that which is to come. As I have decreed, so shallmy judgments begin at the house of God. Thereare those in my church who have a name amongyou, who are adulterers and adulteresses, and thosewho blaspheme my name, and those who love andmake a lie, and those who revel and drink with thedrunken. If they do not speedily repent of thiswickedness and abomination, they should be severedfrom the ordinances of my house, saith the Lord.There are many who have need to repent, whose lusts ^hearts^are set upon the things of this world, who aspire tothe honors of men, and do not honor the priesthood,nor seek to build up the kingdom of God, as they should.Neither do they learn and comprehend that the rightsof the priesthood are inseparably connected with thepowers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven can 
 DISCOURSEBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,delivered in the Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Dec. 12th, 1869.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANSThe few of us who met here this forenoonhad the privilege of listening to a veryinteresting discourse from Bro. Penrose, on the first principles of the gospel. I saythe "few" who were here, for there were few, and there are every Sabbath in the forepart of the day. I think if the Latter-daySaints prized their privileges as they oughtto do, there would be more attend meetingon a Sunday morning, there would be moreof us faithful to the Lord our God and tothe covenants we have made if we did butrealize the rewards that, in the future, willbe awarded for the deeds done here in the flesh.There was one principle referred to byBro. Penrose this morning, upon which Iwish to make a few remarks, for the benefitof the Elders of Israel. It is a very commonsaying with us, as Elders, in our remarksconcerning the gifts of the gospel to speak ofconfirming the gifts of the Holy Ghost bythe laying on of hands. There is no differ-ence with regard to our faith, opinions orviews, as a Church, pertaining to this principle; it is only in the manner in whichwe use our language. There is a difference between the gifts of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost itself. As Brother Penrose said this morning, we repent of our sins, arebaptized for the remission of them and wereceive the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost; but the elders, when speaking on this principle, instead of saying so, not unfrequently say "for thereception of the gifts of the Holy Ghost." Now we have no right, power nor authorityto seal the gifts of the Holy Ghost upon anybody, they are the property of the HolyGhost itself. To explain this I will say, forinstance, Prest. Young may go and preachin every ward in this city; yet it is President Young in each ward. When in the 14th Ward he may give a man an apple; in the13th Ward he may give another person a loaf of bread; in the 10th Ward he may givea man a dollar in money; in the 1st Ward he may give a man a horse and carriage.Now they are all different gifts, but he isone and the same man who bestows them.I merely bring up this figure by way ofillustration.We lay hands upon the heads of thosewho embrace the gospel and we say untothem, "In the name of the Lord JesusChrist receive ye the Holy Ghost." We seal this blessing upon the heads of thechildren of men, just as Jesus and His Apostles and the servants of God have donein every age when preaching the gospel of Christ. But the gifts of the Holy Ghost areHis property to bestow as he sees fit. Toone is given the spirit of prophecy, to another a tongue, to another the interpreta-tion of tongues and to another the gift of healing. All these gifts are by the samespirit, but all are the gifts of the HolyGhost, to bestow as He sees fit, as themessenger of the Father and the Son to thechildren of men.The Holy Ghost, as was justly presentedthis morning, is different from the commonspirit of God, which we are told lighteth every man that cometh into the world. TheHoly Ghost is only given to men throughtheir obedience to the Gospel of Christ; and 
 Before the close of this conferencethere is a subject upon which I wish tobear my testimony. There were per-haps very few people here yesterdaywho are in this assembly today, whenBrother Thatcher delivered a lectureupon the life of President Brigham Young. He referred to a saying of President Young which I, being a wit-ness of, feel it my duty to allude to. Iam the first person unto whom he madethe remark, and the only one living inthe flesh who was with him and JosephSmith, the Prophet of God, when he gave to the Twelve Apostles their chargeconcerning the Priesthood and the keysof the Kingdom of God; and as I myselfshall soon pass away like other men, Iwant to leave my testimony to theseLatter-day Saints.I was sitting with Brigham Young in*Remarks by President Wilford Woodruff atthe Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, Sunday, June2nd, 1889. 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday Afternoon,July 20, 1883.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.OBJECT OF MEETING TOGETHER—OUR DEPENDENCE UPON THE SPIRITOF THE LORD—CERTAIN RIGHTS WHICH BELONG TO ALL MANKIND—UNPOPULARITY OF GOD'S SERVANTS IN ALL AGES OF THE WORLD—A MAN MUST BE BORN AGAIN BEFORE HE CAN UNDERSTANDTHE THINGS OF GOD—THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS—THE GOSPEL THE SAME IN ALL DISPENSATIONS—HOWTHE GOSPEL WAS RESTORED—THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST—UTAH BUILT UP BY THE POWER OF GOD—JOSEPH SMITH RECEIVEDALL THE KEYS OF THE PRIESTHOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OFANGLES—FULFILLMENT OF REVELATION—THE PRIESTHOOD—PLURALMARRIAGE.WE meet here upon the Sabbathday for the purpose of partaking ofthe sacrament, the emblems of theLord's body and blood which were broken and shed for us, and also togive and receive instruction as we may be led by the Spirit of God.It is well known to the Latter-day Saints—though perhaps not tostrangers—that no Elder or member of the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints who enters intothis Tabernacle knows who is goingto be called upon to speak to thepeople. Hence no man spends a week, a day, an hour, or a mo-ment to prepare a discourse todeliver unto the people. We areall of us dependent upon the Spiritof the Lord, upon revelation,upon inspiration, upon the HolyGhost, in order to be qualified toteach the people before whom weare called to speak, and if the Lord does not give me the Holy Spirit this afternoon, I promise you allyou will not get much out of BrotherWoodruff, whether they be Saints orstrangers. I have never seena day since I have been a memberof this Church, that I have felt that any man was qualified to teach saint or sinner, Jew or Gentile, the inhabitants of the earth abroad or athome, only as he was moved upon by the power of God. I have never believed any man was qualified from the days of Father Adam toour day to go forth among the in-habitants of the earth with thedeclaration of the Gospel of JesusChrist, in a way and manner to con-vince them or teach them the Gospelin its truth and purity, and in thepower of God, only by inspiration. I have never believed that any manwas qualified in any age of the world to build up the kingdom of God,or do the will of God only uponthat principle. And I have 
 people of God in all the word, when they rise up to testify, and when they stand forth to teach the Saints, andto present principles before them that are calculated to save them if adhered to, I wish the Saints tounderstand that those teachings, orthose precepts have to be received byus as a people, for they will prove asavor of life unto life or death unto death.I thought of the children of Israel this morning. Now, says Moses to them, I have set life and death beforeyou, choose which you will receive,and it is just so with us, the wayof life is pointed out and if weneglect to walk therein, there isnothing but death stares us in the face. [##Deuteronomy 30:19##] Let us stop and reflect a moment—let us see whether it is best for us to receive life or death. Brethren, you have heard plain truths,and they have been dictated by thepower of the Holy Ghost and by the testimony of Jesus Christ,and now is the time for you todecide whom ye will serve. WhenI used to hear the Prophet Joseph,and when I hear Brigham, orHeber, or Jedediah M. Grant, orthe Twelve Apostles, or any other men, if they speak by the spirit andpower of God, and they tell us thussaith the Lord, so and so will come to pass, for instance those who will feed and clothe these Lamanites andsee to their wants, as our Presidenthas told us, they shall be blessed and prosper, while those who despise them shall go down and shall notstand in the kingdom of God, I believe that what they say will befulfilled. I also believe that whichwas said here to-day, viz.: That wedo forget what we are, and we often forget who we are; we forget, as apeople in these mountains, by whathand we have been led here, and by whom we have been governed and controled since this kingdom has been organized and the holy Priesthood committed to man upon the earth.We become so overcome by the caresof life that we neglect and forgetour duties, and as the brethren haveremarked with reference to our brethren and sisters in this place,they do not realize the responsibility that rests upon us. Do we realize the salvation that is to be given tothis people? If we did we wouldprize our privileges far more than we do at the present time. How many of us who are now in this congregation rea-lize as we ought the salvation and the privileges which are granted to us?Do you appreciate the Priesthood thatis given you, and that the keys of thekingdom are given to you, and thatthe world of mankind are dependentupon you for salvation? No, not asyou ought. We forget our God and our prayers, we forget to call uponGod for his Holy Spirit to rest uponus, that we may live to his honour and glory. Truly, if the Elders in this Church and kingdom realized what is put into their possession, and that the God of heaven will actually require an account of our stewardship,an account of what we have been doing, and what use we have beenmaking of the gifts and blessingswhich he has bestowed upon us, we should be more diligent in the per-formance of all our duties, and we should often act differently to what we do, and pursue a different course, and especially concerning our red brethren. And I will say to youbrethren who reside in Provo, forGod's sake listen to counsel, and forthe sake of the house of Israel, andfor your own sake listen to the in-structions of President Young andcarry them into practice. Do not goaway from this stand and let thosethings escape your minds, and be like water spilled upon the ground which cannot be gathered again, butreceive them as the revelations of 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFaddressed the assemblage as follows:I feel very thankful that my lifehas been preserved to attend another semi-annual conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hope and trust thatwhile we are together our hearts may be lifted in prayer to God, andthat we may enjoy His Holy Spirit and the revelations of heaven; that what may be said while we are as-sembled together during our confer-ence may be according to the mindof God.I feel that, of all people under heaven, we have the greatest reason to rejoice before the Lord that we have lived in a day and generation when the God of Israel has set His hand to establish His Kingdom, to gather together His people, to build up Zion, to carry out the great pur-poses which the Lord has promised and given by revelation through the mouths of inspired men—Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostles—since the world began. I rejoice in the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ; I always have since I have been made acquaintedwith it.It has been my lot and privilege to be associated with the Latter-day Saints for over fifty years. I have seen the afflictions, the tribulations,the persecutions through which thispeople have been called to pass from their organization until the present day. But we have everything to encourage us as the Saints of God,as those who have entered into cove-nant with Him, obeyed His com-mandments, and walked in the ordi-nances of His house. The Lord has never in any dispensation or gen-eration failed to carry out His purposes and His works; and of all the generations and dispensations that God has given to men, this lastand great dispensation—the greatest of all dispensations—has been re-vealed to the human family.The Kingdom has been revealed, the Church of Jesus Christ has been organized, the Zion of God has been inaugurated, the people of God have been called together; and in all the troubles and trials through which we, as a people, have been called topass, there has been no power that has stayed the hand of God or thwarted His purposes with regardto the carrying out of His principlesor those which have been revealed unto the Latter-day Saints.The Lord has called—commenc-ing with Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God—Apostles and Prophets, Patriarchs and Elders, High Priests and Seventies in these last days togo forth and warn the world. Wehave been under the necessity of doing this. As the Lord told Ez-ekiel, He sent him as a watchman unto the House of Israel; He told him what the consequences wouldbe if he did not fulfil his mission and do his duty--that the blood of that generation of the House of Israel would be required at his hands. So the God of heaven ordained whenHe raised up Joseph Smith the Pro-phet to organize this Church and Kingdom. He stood as a watchman on the walls of Zion unto this gene-ration. There are 30,000 people, I suppose, today dwelling in these hills of Israel who hold some por-tion of the Holy Priesthood. It is our duty to warn the world; we havebeen called to do this; we would havebeen under condemnation if we hadnot fulfilled that duty; and so the Church and Kingdom of God have grown until the present day.With regard to our future, it is in the hands of God, who holds thedestiny of this people and of all men in His own hands. I would say to the Latter-day Saints. Fear not; lay your burdens upon the Lord, and He will not fail us. He will not fail in carrying out all Hispurposes and all His promises unto us. The Zion of God will arise, and so will the glory and power of God, and we shall be prepared as a bridefor the coming of the bridegroom.Let our hearts be raised to God while we are assembled together in this Conference, that we may have His Holy Spirit with us continually. 
 not be controlled nor handled, only upon the prin-ciples of righteousness. Such should repent andturn unto the Lord, and seek for the Holy Spiritto guide them. Judgments will begin uponmy house, and from thence will they go forth untothe world, and the wicked cannot escape. Blessed are the pure in heart, for my blessingsawait them in this life, and eternal life in theworld to come.Thus saith the Lord unto you, my servantsthe apostles, who dwell in the flesh, Fear ye notyour enemies. Let not your hearts be troubled. Iam in your midst. I am your advocate withthe Father. I have given mine angels chargeconcerning you. Mine eyes are upon you,and the eyes of your heavenly Father and theheavenly hosts and all justified spirits made perfectare watching over you. Your works are manifestbefore the faces of my servants who have sealed theirtestimony with their blood, and before all my ser-vants of the Twelve Apostles whom I have takenunto myself. The vail is taken from off theirfaces and they know your works. They await your coming when you have finished yourtestimony in the flesh. Therefore, be ye faith-ful until I come. My coming is at the door[.] 
 the depot in the city of Boston at thetime when the two Prophets were mar-tyred. Of course we had no telegraphsand no fast reports as we have today togive communication over the land. Dur-ing that period Brother Young was wait-ing there for a train of cars to go toPeterborough. Whilst sitting there wewere overshadowed by a cloud of dark-ness and gloom as great as I ever wit-nessed in my life under almost any cir-cumstances in which we were placed.Neither of us knew or understood thecause until after the report of the deathof the Prophets was manifested to us. Brother Brigham left; I remained inBoston and next day took passage forFox Islands, a place I had visited some years before, and baptized numbers ofpeople and organized branches uponboth those islands. My father in-law,Ezra Carter, carried me on a wagonfrom Scarborough to Portland. I thereengaged passage on board of a steamer. I had just put my trunk on board and wasjust bidding my father-in-law farewell,when a man came out from a shop—ashoemaker—holding a newspaper inhis hand. He said, "Father Carter,Joseph and Hyrum Smith have beenmartyred—they have been murdered inCarthage jail!"As soon as I looked at the paper theSpirit said to me that it was true. I hadno time for consultation, the steamer's bell was ringing, so I stepped on board and took my trunk back to land. As I drew it off, the plank was drawn in. Itold Father Carter to drive me back toScarborough. I there took the car forBoston, and arrived at that place on the Saturday night.On my arrival there I received a letter which had been sent from Nauvoo, giv-ing us an account of the killing of the Prophets. I was the only man in Bos-ton of the quorum of the Twelve.I had very strange feelings, as I haveno doubt all the Saints had. I attendeda meeting on the following day in Boyd-ston's Hall, where a vast number of theinhabitants of Boston and some threehundred Latter day Saints had assem-bled. Hundreds of men came to thatmeeting to see what the "Mormons" were going to do now that their Proph-ets were dead. I felt braced up; everynerve, bone and sinew within me seemedas though made of steel. I did not sheda tear. I went into that hall, though Iknew not what I was going to say to that vast audience. I opened the Bible pro-miscuously and opened to the words of St. John where he saw under the altarthe souls of them that were slain for theword of God, and heard them cry, "Howlong, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thounot judge and avenge our blood onthem that dwell on the earth?" TheLord informed them that they must wait a little season, until their brethren wereslain as they were. I spoke on those words.Next day I met Brigham Young in thestreets of Boston, he having just re-turned, opposite into Sister Voce's house.We reached out our hands, but neitherof us was able to speak a word. Wewalked into Sister Voce's house. Weeach took a seat and veiled our faces. We were so overwhelmed with grief andour faces were soon bathed in a flood of tears. I felt then that I could talk, thoughI could not do so before—that is, toBrother Brigham. After we had doneweeping we began to converse togetherconcerning the death of the Prophets. Inthe course of the conversation, he smotehis hand upon his thigh and said,"Thank God, the keys of the Kingdomare here." Brother Thatcher referredto that yesterday.All that President Young or myself, or any member of the Quorum need havedone in the matter was to have referredto the last instructions at the last meet-ing we had with the Prophet Joseph be-fore starting on our mission. I have al-luded to that meeting many times in mylife.The Prophet Joseph I am now satis-fied had a thorough presentiment thatthat was the last meeting we would holdtogether here in the flesh. We had hadour endowments; we had had all theblessings sealed upon our heads thatwere ever given to the Apostles orProphets on the face of the earth. On 
 CONFERENCE.A Large Attendance and a Good SpiritPrevailed.PRESIDENT WOODRUFF PRESENT.Synopsis of the Addresses Made Duringthe Conference.The regular quarterly Conferenceconvened as announced at 10 a.m.last Sunday morning. The peoplewere delighted to notice the pres-ence of President Woodruff. Of theApostles F. D. Richards, MosesThatcher and M. W. Merrill werepresent:PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFarose and said:I feel thankful to have the privi-lege again of meeting with theLatter-day Saints in this comfort-able building here in Logan.When I look upon our situation, and the position we occupy, and the scenes that we are called to pass through, I can only acknowl-edge myself the hand of God in the preservation of my own life and the lives of my brethren and sisters until the present time. We have passed through rather a peculiarseason. We have had a good deal of sickness. We have had more deaths from it the past year than in any two years since we have been in these valleys, especi-ally among the aged; and there is hardly any of us who has been able to escape the pestilence or sickness, or whatever you may call it, that has passed over the country.  We have had very many suddendeaths in Salt Lake and other por-tions of the Territory. Men have passed away with a very few mom-ent's sickness.I have not been able to attend any public meetings during last winter for some three months. I attended two or three funerals when called. But I thought on my birthday, the first of March, I rose in the morning sick, I went to meeting sick; and while there I had to leave and go home. Eight days I was confined to my house and bed a good deal of the time.  My counselor, Brother Smith, has been very sick with the same ill-ness. Brother Cannon has also been afflicted and it was not deemed wise for him to attend this conference. Several of the twelve have also passed through more or less of this sickness. Well, while some of our brethren and friends have died in a few hours warning,our lives have been preserved. I attribute this in a measure to the faith and prayers of the Latter-day Saints. I would say that I feel this myself. If there is any-thing that will humble a man be-fore the Lord it is to live in thehearts of the Latter-day Saints and need their prayers.I will say that I have been a marvel and a wonder. The saints that I have been associated with in former days in Kirtland and Nauvoo and from the organization of the church have been called away while my life has been pre-served for what purpose the Lord knows; I do not.  But I acknowl-edge the hand of God in these things. We are here upon a mis-sion. We have a responsibility resting upon us as leaders of the people and as elders of Israel and as Latter-day Saints in every capa-city in which we are called to act, both male and female.We are passing through a rather peculiar portion of our history and I am the same to-day as I ever have been since I have been a member of the church in my faith, feelings and belief. I know that we have been called and we have been pre-served as a people and as the house of Israel through the loins of Abra-ham, Isaac and Jacob; and many have been called in the latter days to stand in the midst of the earth to prune the vineyard once more for the last time, to labor as ser-vants of God, as instruments in the hands of God, for laying the foundation of the great work of the last dispensation of the fullness oftime. This is our mission. It has been our fortune to stand in the midst of the generation. We have been raised up in the midst of a generation to labor in this great cause to warn the world once more for the last time, to prune the vine-yard for the last time before the coming of the Son of Man and our numbers are very few as has been the case in every age and gen-eration of man when God has raised up a people to perform his work in the midst of the inhabitants of the earth. Their numbers have been few, and I was going to say, a hiss and a byword, in a measure, among all generations of men when there has been a people of God.The Lord Himself has been a very unpopular being upon the face of the earth. Since Lucifer has had power among the children of men,Jesus Christ has been one of the most unpopular men that dweltin the flesh in His day and genera-tion; and He had the hatred and the persecution, and the oppression, and the opposition of His own father's house, that is, of the Jewish nation. He came unto His ownand His own received Him not.The Savior Himself labored but a short time among the Jews, but He labored long enough to organize a church.  He labored long enough to choose apostles and seventies and to raise up a number of discipleswho received His teachings and followed Him. All of them were called, especially the apostles--those who were leaders in the church. They were called to sacri-fice their lives. Every one of the apostles was persecuted and sacri-ficed or put to death in some way except John the Revelator, the only one preserved by the power of God. You see this the case throughout the world in all dispensations, and we ourselves are no exception tothese truths. Joseph Smith himself from the time that he received the plates containing the history of the Book of Mormon, the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephriam which was to be put in the Bible, the stick of Judah, in the last daysas instruments to gather together the children of God and the house of Israel.This church has now been organ-ized over sixty years and its his-tory is before us, its history is be-fore the world; but certainly all the saints of God, all men and women who have received a testimony for themselves are to clearly under-stand that the work that has been performed here on the earth should strengthen their faith. For if there is any generation of the children of men in the world that has had cause to rejoice it is the Latter-day Saints. But we have not been with-out our warfare and persecution, not without occupying a position where our enemies have been en-gaged against us.The Elders should have their quorums organized, and the quorums of the teachers, deacons and priests should magnify their callings. The priesthood is the gift of God to man. I am anxious that our brethren should not rush forward for some higher office until they magnify the office they al-ready hold. When a class of men and women have the blessings of the priesthood, their prayers will have power before the Lord. Now we have all these organizations of the sisters in Relief Societies and other capacities, and all these in-stitutions have been organized of God. I am going to say good-bye and God bless you. There has beenexcellent council given here.  Here is the element that the Lord has prepared for the building up of His kingdom. God bless you.  Amen.

 every man who receives that spirit has a comforter within—a leader and guide todictate him. This spirit reveals, day by day, to every man who has faith, thosethings which are for his benefit. As Job said, "there is a spirit in man and the in-spiration of the Almighty giveth it under-standing." [##Job 32:8##] It is this inspiration of God toHis children in every age of the world that is one of the necessary gifts to sustain man and enable him to walk by faith, and to goforth and obey all the dictations and com-mandments and revelations which Godgives to His children to guide and direct them in life.We have a long list given to us in theNew Testament scriptures of those, who, inancient days, lived, labored and performedtheir duties by faith. Among them was Noah, who, being warned of God, went forthand prepared an ark for the salvation of himself and family. Abraham, also, offeredup his son Isaac by faith, because he was called and commanded of God, believing inthe promises God had made unto him. [##Genesis 22:1-19##]This gift and principle of faith is neces-sary for the Saints in every age of the worldto enable them to build up the kingdom ofGod and perform the work required of them. All that the ancients did was byfaith. Jesus and His apostles often quotedthe prophecies of the ancient prophets andshowed that they were fulfilling them.Even the labors of Jesus, from the manger to the cross, through his whole life of pain,sorrow, affliction, suffering, persecutionand derision, were all by faith. It was by the power of the Father, whose work Hehad come to perform, that He was sustain-ed. He fully believed that He would beable to accomplish all that He had been sent to perform. It was on this principle that He fulfilled every requirement and obeyedevery law, even that of baptism, when Hewas immersed in the Jordan by John, whoheld the Aaronic priesthood and the keys of baptism for the remission of sins. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] Bap-tism was a righteous law; in fact, it was thelaw of God to save the children of men, and Jesus was the door, and He, althoughfree from sin and guile, complied with it as an ensample to His disciples and the rest of the children of men.The Apostles, in their labors, had to workon the same principle that the Saints inboth former and latter days have had towork upon—namely the principle of faith.Joseph Smith had to work by faith. It istrue that he had a knowledge of a great many things, as the Saints in former dayshad, but in many things he had to exer-cise faith. He believed He was fulfillingthe prophecies of the ancient prophets. Heknew that God had called him, but in the establishment [o]f His kingdom He had to work continually by faith. The church was organized on the 6th of April, 1830,with six members, but Joseph had faiththat the kingdom thus commenced, like agrain of mustard seed, would become a great church and kingdom upon the earth; and from that day until the day on whichhe sealed his testimony with his blood, hiswhole life was as if wading through the deep waters of persecution and oppression,received from the hands of his fellowmen.He had all this to endure through faith, and he was true, faithful and valiant in the testimony of Jesus to the day of his death.All the labors that we have performedfrom that day until the present have been by faith, and we, as Latter-day Saints,should seek to cherish and grow in this principle, that we may have faith in everyrevelation and promise and in every wordof the Lord, that has been given in the Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants, for they will surely come topass as the Lord God lives, for the unbeliefof this generation will not make the truthsof God without effect.When the members of Zion's Camp were called, many of us had never beheld eachother's faces; we were strangers to eachother and many had never seen the prophet. We had been scattered abroad,like corn sifted in a seive, throughout thenation. We were young men, and were called upon in that early day to go up and redeem Zion, and what we had to do we had to do by faith. We assembled togetherfrom the various States at Kirtland and went up to redeem Zion, in fulfilment of the commandment of God unto us. God accepted our works as He did the works of Abraham. We accomplisheda great deal, though apostates and unbe-lievers many times asked the question"what have you done?" We gained an ex-perience that we never could have gainedon any other way. We had the privilegeof beholding the face of the prophet, andwe had the privilege of travelling a thousand miles with him, and seeing the workings of the spirit of God with him, and the rev-elations of Jesus Christ unto him and the fulfilment of those revelations. Andhe gathered some two hundred Elders fromthroughout the nation in that early day andsent us broadcast into the world to preachthe gospel of Jesus Christ. Had I not goneup with Zion's Camp I should not havebeen here to-day, and I presume thatwould have been the case with many othersin this Territory. By going there we werethrust into the vineyard to preach the gos-pel, and the Lord accepted our labors. Andin all our labors and persecutions, with ourlives often at stake, we have had to work and live by faith.The Twelve Apostles were called by rev-elation to go to Far West, Caldwell County, to lay the foundation of the corner stone of the Temple. When that revela-tion was given this Church was in peacein Missouri. It is the only revelation thathas ever been given since the organization of the Church, that I know anything about, that had day and date given with it. TheLord called the Twelve Apostles, while inthis state of prosperity, on the 26th day ofApril, 1838 to go to Far West to lay thecorner stone of the Temple; and from thereto take their departure to England to preachthe gospel. Previous to the arrival of that period the whole Church was driven out of the State of Missouri, and it was as much as a man's life was worth to be found in theState if it was known that he was a Latter-day Saint; and especially was this the casewith the Twelve. When the time came for the Corner stone of the Temple to be laid, as directed in the revelation, the Church was in Illinois, having been expelled from Missouri by an edict from the Governor.Joseph and Hyrum Smith and Parley P. Pratt were in chains in Missouri for thetestimony of Jesus. As the time drew nigh for the accomplishment of this work, thequestion arose, "What is to be done?" Hereis a revelation commanding the Twelve to be in Far West on the 26th day of April, tolay the Corner stone of the Temple there; it had to be fulfilled. The Missourians had sworn by all the Gods of eternity that if every other revelation was given through Jo-seph Smith were fulfilled, that should notbe, for the day and date being given theydeclared that it should fail. The general feeling in the Church, so far as I know, was that, under the circumstances it wasimpossible to accomplish the work; and the Lord would accept the will for the deed.This was the feeling of Father Smith, thefather of the Prophet. Joseph was not with us, he was in chains in Missouri, for his re-ligion. When President Young asked the question of the Twelve, "Brethren, what will you do about this?" The reply was:"The Lord has spoken and it is for us toobey." We felt that the Lord God had givenen the commandment and we had faith togo forward and accomplish it, feeling thatit was His business whether we lived or died in its accomplishment. We started for Mis-souri. There were two wagons. I had one and took Brother Pratt and PresidentYoung in mine; Brother Cutler, one of the building committee, had the other. We reached Far West and laid the Corner stone according to the revelation that had beengiven to us. We cut off apostates and those who had sworn away the lives ofthe brethren. We ordained Darwin Chase and Norman Shearer into the Seventies. Brother George A. Smith and myself wereordained into the quorum of the Twelve onthe Corner stone of the Temple; we had beencalled before but not ordained. We thenreturned, nobody having molested or madeus afraid. We performed that work byfaith, and the Lord blessed us in doing it.The devil, however, tried to kill us, for before we started for England everyone of the Twelve was taken sick, and it wasabout as much as we could do to move orstir. I had traveled in Tennessee, Missis-sippi, Kentucky and Arkansas for two orthree years, and that too, during the sicklyseason, where they were not well enoughto take care of the sick, and I had never hadthe ague. But upon this occasion I wastaken with the ague, the first time in mylife. All the Twelve had something thematter with them. But we had to travelsick; we had to travel by faith in order tofulfil the mission to which we had been called by revelation. But the Lord sus-tained us, He did not forsake us.  We wentto England, and we baptized, in the year 1840, something like seven thousand peo-ple, and established churches in almost allthe principal cities of the kingdom. Bro.Pratt established a branch in Edinburgh, Scotland. Brother Kimball, George A. andmyself built up a branch in London, and sev-[eral] branches in the south of England. We baptized 1,800 persons in the south of Eng-land in seven months; out in that numbertwo hundred were preachers belonging to different denominations of that land. Weopened an emigration office, published thebook of Mormon and gathered many toZion. God, was with us, and I may saythat he has been in all the labors of this Church and Kingdom.In the pioneer journey,  coming here, we had to come by faith; we knew nothingabout this country, but we intendedto come to the mountains; Joseph hadorganized a company to come here, before his death. He had these things before him,and understood them perfectly. God hadrevealed to him the future of this Churchand Kingdom, and had told him, from timeto time, that the work of which he was lay-ing the foundation would become an ever-lasting kingdom—would remain forever. President Young led the pioneers to this country. He had faith to believe that theLord would sustain us. All who travelledhither at that time had this faith. The spirit of God was with us, the Holy Ghostwas with us; and the angels of the Lordwere with us and we were blessed. All,and more than we anticipated, in coming here, has been realized, as far as time would permit.When the Mormon Battalion was calledfor by the United States, we were in our exile, having been driven from our homes,our country and graves of our fathers, fromlands we had bought of the United States Government, for our religion, into the wil-derness. The Government made a demandupon us for five hundred men to go to the Mexican war. I do not suppose that theyexpected we would furnish them, but we did, and we did it by faith. Five hundred men, the strength of Israel, were sent to fight the battles of their country, leavingtheir wives, children and teams on the prairie. They had to exercise faith, and sohad we who remained, believing it wouldturn out for the best, and it has proved so. Every member of that Battalion who has remained faithful has always rejoiced, fromthat day to this, that he was a memberthereof. It has proved a blessing to him, and it proved salvation to Zion.I have referred to these things to show that hitherto, in our labors to build up the Church and Kingdom of God upon theearth, we have had to labor by faith. It is still requisite. God has called upon us towarn this generation. He has set His handto establish Zion—the great Zion of God—about which the prophets have said so much. No prophet has spoken morepointedly on this subject than Isaiah. Our drivings from Missouri, our persecutions,our travels along the Platte River, the man-ner of our coming to the mountains of Israel, our return again to the land of Zion andthe building of the temple in JacksonCounty have all been spoken of by Isaiahas well as by all the prophets who havespoken concerning the Zion of the latterdays.We have exercised faith in the carryingout of these promises and in the fulfillingof those revelations of God unto us. Wehave walked and lived by faith, preciselythe same as the apostles, prophets and saintshave done in every dispensation and age of the world; for there is one remarkablefeature with regard to the work of God, and that is, it has always been unpopular in every age and generation. The Lord hasnever sent a message to the inhabitants ofthe earth but what it has been despised,in a great measure, by most of themAs it was in the days of Noah and Lot, so shall it be in the days of thecoming of the Son of Man. [##Matthew 24:37##] In the days ofNoah there were eight souls saved, afterone hundred and twenty years' labor in preaching and building the Ark. [##Genesis 7:1-7##] In thedays of Lot but very few left the city of Sodom. Lot and his family left, and weare told that his wife was turned into a pillarof salt; and what the angels had told Lot concerning Sodom and Gomorrah came topass—fire and brimstone were sent downfrom heaven upon them and they were destroyed. [##Genesis 19:24-29##]The work of God and the Gospel of Christ have always been unpopular. Take the life of the Savior himself. There is a fair ex-ample. Trace Him from the day he wasborn until His death, and who were Hisfriends. A few illiterate fishermen. Jesus Christ came to the house of Judah and theyrejected him; and Jerusalem, Judea, andthe inhabitants of all the region round aboutrose up against Him with the exception ofa few poor men and women. Still He was the Savior of the world, the great Shiloh ofIsrael, the great King of the Jews. That is a fair ensample of the way in which the work of God has been received in every age and dispensation. All that Jesus saidconcerning the Jews has come to pass to thevery letter; not one jot or tittle has fallen unfulfilled. Their history for the last eigh-teen hundred years, until the present day,has been a remarkable ensign to the nationsof the earth of the truth of the Bible and ofthe truth of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of Him being the Savior of the world. All that He said concerning themand all that Moses predicted concerningtheir dispersion and about their being driven, as corn is sifted through a seive,among the nations; about the manner inwhich their women did evil to the childrenof their own bosoms when Jerusalem wassurrounded by the Roman army, when itwas taken and over two millions of its in-habitants were destroyed by sword, pestilence and famine, has been fulfill-ed. [##Amos 9:9##] All these things have been in strictfulfilment of the sayings of Moses andJesus concerning them. When the Sa-vior was sentenced to death, they cried"Let his blood be upon us and upon our children;" and they have been trampledunder foot by the whole Gentile world for the last eighteen hundred years. [##Matthew 27:21-25##] In their affliction and persecutions they have had tosuffer almost beyond the endurance of man, and until the last few years, havescarcely had the right of citizenship in anynation under heaven—except in the UnitedStates. All that has been spoken concern-ing them has had its fulfilment as fast astime would admit.It is so with regard to the gospel of JesusChrist in the latter days. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub, will theynot say the same of his household? They said that he cast out devils by Beelzebub,the prince of devils, they said he was a pestilent fellow and a stirrer-up of sedition and strife, still -- he was the Savior of theworld. [##Matthew 10:25##]This principle of unbelief has existedin every age; it exists to-day. The eldersof Israel have had to contend with this power of darkness, with persecution, op-pression, ridicule and opposition from thosewho should have received their message—a message which was for the good and sal-vation of those who rejected it. The Jewsshould have received the testimony of Christ, but as a nation they rejected it. Ourexperience has been very similar to that of Jesus and His apostles. We have had tolabor by faith. We have had to exercise faith in the revelations that have been givento us in the Book of Doctrine and Cov-enantsand Book of Mormon, as well as inthe Bible. These revelations pourtray whatlies before us as a people. The fate of thisnation and the nations of the earth has beenpourtrayed by the ancient prophets in theBook of Mormon and Bible. Isaiah hastold us what will come to pass in the latterdays concerning those who fight againstMount Zion and against the children ofZion. Every weapon will be broken, everynation that will not serve Zion shall beutterly wasted away saith the Lord; for theLord will fight in defence of the land of Zion. He will establish the kingdom that Daniel saw, in fact that kingdom has beenestablished; the Zion of God has been setup, the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints has been established byrevelation from Jesus Christ in our day andgeneration; and we are called to build it up, we are called to perform its work. As I have often remarked, the Gods, the Angels, the whole heavens, all the good men, allthe spirits of the just that dwell in the eternal world are watching with vast in-terest the labors of this people.They are not perfect without us, we arenot perfect without them. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:15##] There is noperiod in the whole history of the world,no dispensation of God to man, that is fraugh with such interest as the dispensa-tion in which we live; there never has been. No prophets, no apostles or inspired menin any age of the world ever had the priv-ilege of laying the foundation of the Zion of God to remain on the earth to be throwndown no more for ever. In every other dis-pensation of the world the people have risenup against God and His Christ, against thekingdom and against the priesthood, andhave overthrown the messengers of heaven,and put to death every man who has borne the kingdom of God, and the kingdom hasbeen taken from the earth. This is true of every age except that of Enoch. He builtup a kingdom and gathered together thepeople after laboring and preaching threehundred and sixty-five years. He per-fected a city, which was called the city of the Zion of God. But behold and lo, the na-tions of the earth awoke and found that Zionhad fled! The Lord took it to Himself; took it away from the earth. The people were righteous; they had become sanctified andthe Lord took them away out of the power of the wicked. Zion could not remain on the earth; there was not power sufficient towithstand the assaults of the wicked; or ifthere was, the time had not come when theLord would make use of the children of men; or there were not enough of the chil-dren of men willing to take hold and man-ifest those principles in their lives so thatthat they could remain on the earth. But in the latter days He will do so. Hehas sworn it by Himself, because there isnone greater to swear by. He has declaredit through the mouth of every prophet that has ever lived on the earth, whose writingswe possess, both in the Bible and Book of Mormon, as well as in those glorious reve-lations in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-nants given through the mouth of JosephSmith the prophet. These sayings are true. We as a people should exercise faith inthem, no matter what may be transpiring in the outside world. We have had the powers of wicked men and devils to con-tend with. We may say that the devil ismad; he is stirred up against Zion: he knows that his reign will last but a littleseason longer.This arch enemy of God and man, calledthe devil, the "Son of the Morning," whodwells here on the earth, is a personage of great power; he has great influence andknowledge. He understands that if thiskingdom, which He rebelled against inHeaven, prevails on the earth, there will beno dominion here for him. He has great influence over the children of men; he la-bors continually to destroy them. He la-bored to destroy them in Heaven; he la-bored to destroy the works of God in Heaven, and he had to be cast out. He is here, mighty among the children of men.There is a vast number of fallen spirits, cast out with him, here on the earth. Theydo not die and disappear; they have not bodies only as they enter the tabernaclesof men. They have not organized bodies, and are not to be seen with the sight of theeye. But there are many evil spirits amongst us, and they labor to overthrowthe Church and kingdom of God. Therenever was a prophet in any age of the world but what the devil was continually at hiselbow. This was the case with Jesus Him-self. The devil followed him continuallytrying to draw Him from His purposes andto prevent Him carrying out the great work of God. You see this manifested when hetook Jesus on to the loftiest pinnacle of the temple and showed Him all the glory ofthe world, telling him that he would giveHm all this if H would fall down and worship him. The poor devil did not own afoot of land nor anything else! The earthwas made by and belonged to the Lord and was His footstool. Yet the devil of-fered that to Jesus which was not his own.Jesus said unto Him, "Get thee behind meSatan." [##Matthew 16:23##]This same character was with the disci-ples as well as with their master. He is with the Latter-day Saints; and he or hisemissaries are with all men trying to lead them astray. He rules in the hearts of theinhabitants of the earth. They are gov-erned and guided by him far more thanby the power of God. This is strange, stillit is true. See the wickedness in the world.See the abominations with which the earthis deluged, causing it to groan under theburden. Where does this evil come from? From the works of the devil. Everythingthat leads to good is from God, while everything that leads to evil is from the devil. Here are the two powers. How many on 
 that occasion the Prophet Joseph roseup and said to us, "Brethren, I have de-sired to live to see this temple built. Ishall never live to see it, but you will. I have sealed upon your heads all the keysof the Kingdom of God. I have sealedupon you every key, power, principlethat the God of heaven has revealed tome or sealed upon me. Now, no matterwhere I may go or what I may do, theKingdom rests upon you."Now don't you wonder why we, as Apostles, could not have understoodthat the Prophet of God was going to be taken from us? But we did not under-stand it. The Apostles in the days ofJesus Christ could not understand whatthe Savior meant when He told them "Iam going away; if I do not go away the Comforter will not come!" Neither didwe understand what Joseph meant."But," he said, after having done this,"ye Apostles of the Lamb of God, mybrethren, upon your shoulders this Kingdom rests; now you have got toround up your shoulders and bear offthis Kingdom." And he also made thisvery strange remark, "If you do not doit you will be damned."I am the last man living who heardthat declaration. He told the truth, too;for would not any of the men who haveheld the keys of the Kingdom of God oran Apostleship in this Church have beenunder condemnation, and would not thewrath of God have rested upon them ifthey had deserted these principles or de-nied and turned from them and under-taken to serve themselves instead of thework of the Lord which was committedto their hands?When the Lord gave the keys of the Kingdom of God, the keys of the Mel-chisedeck Priesthood, of the Apostle-ship, and sealed them upon the head ofJoseph Smith, He sealed them upon his head to stay here upon the earth untilthe coming of the Son of Man. Wellmight Brigham Young say, "The keysof the Kingdom of God are here." Theywere with him to the day of his death.They then rested upon the head of another man—President John Taylor. He held those keys to the hours of hisdeath. They then fell by turn, or in theprovidence of God, upon Wilford Wood-ruff.I say to the Latter-day Saints the keysof the Kingdom of God are here, andthey are going to stay here, too, untilthe coming of the Son of Man. Let allIsrael understand that. They may notrest upon my head but a short time, butthey will then rest on the head of an-other Apostle, and another after him,and so continue until the coming of theLord Jesus Christ in the clouds of heavento "reward every man according to thedeeds done in the body."I want to add another thing, because I feel it my duty to say it to the Latter-day Saints. There is a feeling—it wasso in the days of Joseph Smith—that hewas not the man to lead the Church. Even his bosom friends, men with whomhe saw the angels of God, Oliver Cow-dery and others, considered him a fallen Prophet and thought they ought to leadthe Church. This history is before youand before the world. The same feelingwas manifest in the days of BrighamYoung when he was called to hold thekeys of the Presidency of the Church. There were other men who thought theyshould be appointed to that office. Butthe God of heaven manifested to you,and to me, and to all men, who were inNauvoo, upon whom the mantle had fallen. Brigham Young took his place,and led the Church and Kingdom ofGod up to the day of his death.There are men today, there will bemen till the coming of the Son of Man,I expect, who feel as though they oughtto lead the Church, as though it is notgoing on right—that this, that, and theother is wrong. I say to all Israel at thisday, I say to the whole world, that theGod of Israel, who organized thisChurch and Kingdom, never ordainedany President or Presidency to lead itastray. Hear it, ye Israel, no man whohas ever breathed the breath of life canhold these keys of the Kingdom of Godand lead the people astray.We talk of revelation. There hasbeen a feeling of wonder many times asto why Brigham Young did not have 
 THE TABERNACLE.BIRTHDAYANNIVERSARYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF AND EMMA S. WOODRUFFYou are cordially invited to attend aRECEPTIONto celebrate theNinetieth Anniversary of my Birthday,and theFifty-ninth of that of my wife, Emma,to be held inThe Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Monday, March 1st, 1897at 10 o'clock, a. m.Wilford Woodruff 
 Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer. Ask andyou shall receive. Whenever you agree as touchinganything, and ask the Father in my name, itshall be given unto you. Seek diligently tobuild up Zion, and to magnify your high cal-ling, and your enemies shall not prevail overyou. Zion shall not be moved out of her place. Zion shall prevail against her enemies. Mypeople shall not be hindered in the building ofmy temples unto my holy name, if they willhearken unto my voice and do as I commandthem.The blood of my servants Joseph and Hy-rum, and of mine apostles and elders, whichhas been shed for the word of God and the testimo-ny of Jesus Christ, cries from the ground for ven-geance upon the nation which has shed theirblood. But their blood shall speedily beavenged, and shall cease to cry unto me, for thehour of God's judgment is fully come and shallbe poured out without measure upon the wicked.But hearken and hear, O ye apostles, elders, andpeople of my church, to the word of the Lord con-cerning you, that for all the blessing that I willpour out upon you and the inhabitants ofZion, and the judgment and destruction 
 Jesus Christ to us. It has been remarked that it costs a great dealto keep the Lamanites, and who doesnot know that everything costs a a good deal in this kingdom? Have you not tithed your whole substance,your flocks and herds and all yourpossessions? Have not the Gentiles robbed you and spoiled you of everything you possessed? and have younot had to make your beds in themud upon the banks of the Missis-sippi river. You have experiencedall this and a great deal more. Does itrequire the same to pay your Tithing? Does it require the same affliction, thesame suffering to keep the command-ments of God, as it did in those days ofpersecution and trial? No, it doesnot. Will it cost as much to farm for them, to feed and clothe them, asit cost us in those times of troubleand perplexity? All will acknow-ledge that it is better to give a partthan to lose the whole, and have toflee to the rocks and mountains, andbe driven from our homes by the Gentile world. You will find, brethrenand sisters, that the trials will beheavier and more severe every time, and you will also find, that when the duties of our calling are light upon us,it will be then that we will require to be stirred up to diligence and to the performance of our duty. The peopleare always the best when they are busily engaged. When I have heardbrother Kimball declare, that if thispeople did not save their wheat and the necessaries of life they would see hard times and famine in the land. I say these things sink like lead intomy feelings, and they always didfrom the very first that I heard them. Whenever I hear things set forth bythe servants of God, I always knowthat there is a meaning to them, andthey always weigh heavily upon mymind. The Lord foreshows us through his servants what is coming to pass, and in this way we have been led by the hand of God; and it has been by his mercies that wehave been guided until the presenttime. The blessings of God have been multiplied upon our heads year afteryear, and we have had more than we deserve bestowed upon us, and the counsel and instructions given us havebeen good. I hope that we will bewise, and not let those things pass away as idle tales, but follow them up and be on hand for every thing thatis required at our hands. I hope thatbrother Snow will lead up in these matters, respecting your meeting-house and farming operations for thenatives, and I hope that they willcarry out the instructions given them, and if the brethren will attend tothese things and do them in faith and in the name of the Lord, I will tellyou how it will be, all you take in hand will prosper, the Lord will bless your crops, and your cattle, and allthat you possess. But if you neglect your labour this year, why next year your labours will be double; and so itwill be year after year until all your blessings will be taken away, and you will be left to yourselves. Then do what is required at your hands, and your yoke will be easy and yourburden light, because you will do eachday that which belongs to that day.I know that what has been saidhere is true, and the Spirit bears record to you and to every honestheart—to every man and woman,that these things are correct. These Lamanites have a right to the holy Priesthood, and it is our duty to carrythe Gospel unto them that they may attain to all its privileges and blessings.We have for the last twenty yearsbeen preaching it in the United States,in Europe, and distant nations of the earth, and thousands have embracedit; but in accomplishing this the Elders of Israel have had to make all kinds of sacrifices, and be absent from 
 felt, both while abroad in the world,as well as at home, that when calledupon to teach the Latter-day Saints or anybody else—I have felt as though my lips ought to be touched with a live coal from off the altar,and my heart filled with inspirationfrom Almighty God. When I think upon the day and age inwhen we live, when I think upon this day and dispensation in which the God of heaven has set His handto carry out the fulfillment of themighty prophecies contained withinthe lids of the Bible, the Old andNew Testaments, the stick of Judah,I realize that in order to comprehend these things a man must be in pos-session of the Spirit of theLord day by day. In the words ofthe Savior as recorded in St. John'sGospel, "This is eternal life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.I say many things when I am called upon to speak in the presence of strangers that I do not confinemyself to when addressing the Saints, because the latter are ac-quainted with our principles, whilethe former are not.As Latter-day Saints we respectthe rights of all men. We believe that all mankind, men and women,in this and every other dispensationand generation, have certain rights;that God has created all men withan agency, I care not in what king-dom, empire, republic or place they dwell. They have a right to enjoy their religion. They have a right to worship God according to thedictates of their own consciences."But," says one, "do you mean thatin empires where an emperor holds the rights and destinies of hissubjects in his hands?" Yes. Imean there is no emperor who breathes the breath of life who hasthe right to deprive one of his sub-jects of the freedom of his religion.I will tell you why. No emperor, no king, no president, no ruler ofany nation under the heavens hasever given his subjects life. Their life has come from God, and God has granted them their agency andthe right to worship Him accordingto the light and knowledge they have. This is the view entertainedby the Latter-day Saints. And Ihave heard Joseph Smith say thatif he were emperor of the whole world, holding the destinies of allmen in his hands, he would defendthe religious rights of every man, whether his religion was right or wrong. And especially ought this to be the case in this American na-tion, the constitution of which guar-antees to all people the right to wor-ship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. This is thebroad platform upon which our government has been founded. Ihave looked upon the Constitutionof the United States as one of the best instruments ever devised by man for the government of the in-habitants of the earth. I look uponit as such to-day. And while weare willing to allow the Methodists,the Baptists, the Presbyterians, theCatholics, and every sect under heav-en, the right to enjoy their religion undisturbed, yet we claim the sameprivilege as a people, as a church, asthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and hence, in expressingmyself here this afternoon with regard to the Gospel of Jesus Christ,or the kingdom of God, if I differfrom any of this congregation, I have a right to differ; the congrega-tion has a right to differ from me; and no man has a right to say, Whydo you so? The destinies of the whole human family are in the hands of God. I shall be held accountable

 revelation, why John Taylor did nothave revelation, why Wilford Woodruffdoes not have revelation, why any otherApostle does not have revelation. I holdin my hand a book of revelations, enoughto lead this Church into the celestialkingdom of God. Anybody who willobey that law will have all the revela-tion that he can fulfill on the earth. We are not without revelation. The heavens are full of it, so is the holy Priesthood.I know the destiny of this people; it is revealed by the God of Israel and lefton record. I know the destiny of thiskingdom, and I want to say, let us try tounite together and fulfill the law of God. You need not trouble about the king-dom God has established. He will takecare of it. The same God who has or-ganized this Zion and gathered onehundred and fifty thousand people herefrom the nations of the earth, has His eye over you, He is watching over you,and He will take care of you when youdo your duty. Zion is not going to bemoved out of her place. The Lord willplead with her strong ones, and if shesins He will chastise her until she ispurified before the Lord.I do not pretend to tell how much sor-row you or I are going to meet with be-fore the coming of the Son of Man. Thatwill depend upon our conduct.With regard to the keys of the King-kom of God, they were placed on theearth to remain, and they will remain until Jesus Christ comes in the clouds ofheaven. But I and other men, the Apos-tles, and all who are called to officiate inthe name of the Lord need the faith andprayers of the Latter-day Saints.By way of closing I will say that Brig-ham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Wood-ruff, these Twelve Apostles around me,and everyone of the Seventies, HighPriests, High Councilors, Presidents ofStakes, the Melchisedec and all theAaronic Priesthood, and all the Latter-day Saints—all will get what they laborfor. Whatsoever we sow, whether goodor evil, of that we will reap the fruit.But in the morning of the resurrectionyou will find Joseph Smith holding thekeys of this kingdom and dispensationat the head of all Israel who belong tothis dispensation; he will hold them to the endless ages of eternity, notwith-standing that we shall all get our rewardfor what we do. The keys of the king-dom were given to Joseph Smith. Theywere placed on the heads of other mento make use of on earth for a short time;and when we get through we shall allhave our reward.Let us make up our minds to serve and honor God. Do not have any fearsconcerning the kingdom; the Lord willlead that aright; and if Brother Wood-ruff or any of the Presidency of this Church should take any course to leadyou astray, the Lord will remove us outof the way. We are in the hands of theLord and those keys will be held andtaken care of by the God of Israel untilHe comes whose right it is to reign.God bless you all. Amen.-[At the evening session PresidentWoodruff made the following additionalremarks:]-Before dismissing this assembly I feelit my duty to say a few words. I ad-dressed the Saints a short time thisafternoon upon a certain subject, and that was in bearing my testimony to thekeys of the kingdom of God, which theLord gave to Joseph Smith, and the retaining of those keys upon the earththrough their bestowal upon the headsof the Apostles. I did not pretend todwell upon the organization of thePriesthood or of the Church in these remarks. My only object was to bearmy testimony upon that subject. Afterthe meeting I began to reflect, from re-marks which I made, that perhaps manyof the people might get an entirely wrong idea of my views with regard tothe kingom of God. I referred to theDoctrine and Covenants—a code of re-velations which the Lord gave to JosephSmith. This book contains some of themost glorious revelations upon doctrine,upon principle, upon government, uponthe kingdom of God and the differentglories, and upon a great many things which reach into the eternal worlds.My leaving this subject there, perhaps,might lead my friends to suppose that I 
 380 THE DESERET NEWS. -[Sept. 15prophet, elder and saint of God, and to all the inhabitants of the earth, "Be ye also ready!" That is what it says to all men. If you have anything to do, any work to perform that is of consequence to yourself or friends, living or dead, do it.Is there any sorrow or mourning in my heart with regard to the departure of Brother Benson? I would rather follow a thousand aostles and prophets to the graveand see their lifeless remains deposited in the dark and silent tomb, than see one man who has tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come make shipwreck of his faith, lose his crown and go to perdition. I have had more sorrow in seeing men, with whom I have traveled and preached the Gospel, turn from the truth, commit wickedness and lose their standing in the Church, than over all the faithful Latter-day Saints I have seen laid in the tomb. When I see a man depart who, like Brother Benson, has been ever willing to go and come and do the bidding of those over him, I look forward with great joy to his reward. He is the first man in the Quorum of the Twelve, who, for the last forty years, has had the privilege of dying a natural death; for most of the apostles who ever tabernacled in the flesh have died as martyrs. We have had two in our quorum who have died thus, besides our prophet and patriarch. True, they will receive a martyr's crown, so will all men who are true and faithful unto death and lay down their lives for the work of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.Brother Benson has died among his friends; he had not been in pain or suffering, or endured a lingering sickness. Thank God he died in the harness and has gone home to receive his reward. During the time he has been a member of the Church he has been on many missions. I will here re-mark, without entering into details, thatat the time the Saints were driven from Illinois to this land, he was called upon and sent east, as one of the agents of the church to prove the eastern country,—our Puritan fathers and friends in New Eng-land, after we had been driven from our homes, country, and the graves of parents, wives and children, to see if they would stretch out their hand to assist us while in the wilderness. He labored faithfully on that mission, visiting Boston and other leading New England cities, calling for contributions to help the poor, the widow and the fatherless, who were, in a measure, in a state of starvation in the wilderness after having been driven from their homesin the midst of an inclement winter. I be-lieve he got fifty dollars. If he had gone into Missouri and split rails by the day I guess he would have made considerable more money in the same time. But never mind! He was faithful on his mission, and returned faithful, and continued so from the commencement of his career as a Lat-ter-day Saint until the day of his death. I rejoice in this, and it is a consolation to his family, and to all Israel to know that he has been true and faithful to his calling. When I contemplate and rea-lize that the little time spent here in this mortal life will fix and mould our destiny for all the endless ages of eternity I try to realize what manner of men we all ought to be.I have traveled a good deal with Brother Benson and have been acquainted with him, as you have, a good many years past, and I can bear this testimony of him,—he has always been ready and willing to la-bor in either temporal or spiritual things. Here on this road he labored faithfully during the past year in building a hun-dred miles of the railroad; he and those associated with him finished their job with punctuality. All these things show the untiring industry and perseverance of the man.This is the way with all of us. We are all called to labor in temporal and spiritual things in building up the kingdom of God in these last days. We have to preach the gospel to the children of men; we have to warn the nations of the earth. We have been called to do this; this is the command of God to the Elders of Israel. In obedience to this they shoulder their knapsacks and without purse or scrip, travel the world over to declare to the children of men the words of life and salvation. In doing this they swim rivers, wade swamps and en-dure much toil and privation. During the last thirty-seven years of my life I haye tra-veled one hundred thousand miles in obedience to this command. It will be well with all men who are faithful in the per-formance of these duties. Brother Benson never performed a mission or any other duty but what he will rejoice over forever, and so it will be with us all. The reward of the faithful will amply repay them for all the labors they ever performed or for the privations they have endured. No la-bor we have ever done that has helped to promote the happiness and well-being of our fellowmen will go unrewarded. Bro-ther Benson, to-day, instead of being with his family in Logan, that is in the flesh, he may be with them in spirit, is privileged to mingle with his brethren who have gone before,—Joseph, Hyrum, David, Par-ley, Heber and the prophets and apostles of former days. He is mingling with them. They have finished their work in the flesh. So has he. He has been suddenly called away from his labors but his works will follow him.I wish to speak to my friends a little, with regard to the position which we occu-py as Elders of Israel, and as the church and kingdom of God upon the earth. I feel im-pressed to do so. I do not know that I wish to say a great deal more with regard to Brother Benson. His labors are before us and the world, and they are before God and angels. I am satisfied with them and I do not know who is not who was acquainted with him. I wish, now, to say something with regard to the organization of this Church and the position occupied by Joseph Smith, Elder Benson and the Apostles and priesthood of this Church.We are living in a very important age, an age in which preparations are making for the second coming of the Messiah to reign a thousand years upon the earth with His Saints. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament will never be fulfilled until this comes to pass. An angel of God, the Reve-lator John informs us, was to fly through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth,—to every nation, kindred, tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come, and worship Him who made the heavens, the earth, the seas and the fountains of water." [##Revelation 14:7##] You may take up Isaiah and all the prophets, and you will find that they refer to this latter-day dispensation, when the Kingdom of God should be established on the earth. There never was a prophet, from Adam down, whose records we have, but had his eye upon this great dispensation of the last days. When the Lord created the earth He placed men upon it, and though the power of sin has entered it, it has not been left by the Lord to go at random. In Adam allfell, or died, but in Christ, the apostle says, all are made alive. [##1 Corinthians 15:22##] Our worthy President has often said, when speaking upon the prevalence of sin in this world, that one of the greatest honors and blessings ever con-ferred on the sons of men, was to come and dwell in the flesh in a sinful world like this, amid the power of evil, temptation and darkness, that they might have the privi-lege of overcoming them and of inheriting eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God. All the prophets have foreseen the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the last days; they have seen Zion pass through all her travail and persecution to her final triumph, when she possessed great glory, power and dominion upon the land of Joseph. Daniel saw the kingdom of God, which he likens to a little stone cut out of the mountains without hands, which grew and increased in size until it filled the whole earth. Daniel said this kingdom was to be an everlasting kingdom. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]Well, brethren and sisters, you and I have lived to see the dawn of the great day thus referred to by the prophets, in which the God of heaven has set His hand for the last time to establish His kingdom upon the earth; a kingdom not to be overthrown, but to remain until sin, Satan and the power of the devil are banished from the face thereof, and until, as the prophets have said, the kingdoms of this world shall be-come the kingdoms of our God and His Christ.This day we have lived to see. This taber-nacle, this congregation, and the multitudes through the valleys of the mountains are the fruits of this work. How did it com-mence? It commenced by an angel of God flying through the midst of heaven and visiting a young man named Joseph Smith, in the year 1827. That was the time of a great awakening among the sectarians of the day—a day of revivals and protracted meetings, when the people were called upon to join themselves to the sectarian churches. This young man looked around amid the the confusion among the different sects, each proclaiming the plan of salvation dif-ferently, and each claiming it was right and that all others were wrong; in the midst of this contention he did not know which to join. While in this state of uncertainty he turned to the Bible, and there saw that pas-sage in the epistle of James which directs him that lacks wisdom to ask of God. He went into his secret chamber and asked the Lord what he must do to be saved. The Lord heard his prayer and sent His angel to him, who informed him that all the sects were wrong, and that the God of heaven was about to establish His work upon the earth. This angel quoted many of the prophecies of Isaiah, and Jeremiah and told this young man that they were about to be ful-filled among the nations of the earth; and he also told him that if he would listen and render obedience to the commands of God, he should be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in establishing His kingdom upon the earth. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:27-54##]These visits were repeated from time to time, during which Joseph received revela-tion and much instruction in the things of God. He taught some of these things to his father and some of his brothers and a few others, but he had no authority to preach or administer in the ordinances of the house of God. Why? Because, as the prophet has said, "No man taketh this honor unto himself, except he be called of God, as was Aaron." [##Hebrews 5:4##] No man, in any gener-ation, has ever had authority to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ unless he was called by revelation. You may read the history of all the prophets and apostles from the creation down, and they have all received the holy priesthood under the hands of God or angels, or under the hands of men who have held this authority. It was so with Joseph Smith. He could not find anybody who possessed this authority, and he called upon the Lord to know what to do, and the Lord sent John the Baptist, who was be-headed for his religion. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8##] John held the Aaronic priesthood, and he came and ordained Joseph Smith to the same priesthood. This gave him power to ad-minister in some of the ordinances of the gospel of Christ. He could baptize for the remission of sins, but he could not lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Lord afterwards sent Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the kingdom intheir day and generation upon the earth, and they ordained him an apostle, and sealed upon his head every key, power and blessing, and all the authority which they exercised in their day. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##]This is the origin of the authority of thethe Latter-day Saints; and from that day until the present the little stone cut out of the mountain has been growing. The Church was organized on the 6th of April, 1830, with six members, and the elders im-mediately went forth, one here and another there, bearing testimony and preaching the doctrines the angel made known to Joseph, and some few, out of many, have received and obeyed the same. This gospel is the the same as that taught by the ancient apostles, namely, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of sin, baptism for the remission of sin, then the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost. These were the doctrines taught by the ancient apostles, and the signs that followed believers anciently follow them in our day. Said Jesus, when sending his apostles forth, to preach:"Go ye into all the world and preach the gos-pel to every creature."He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."And these signs shall [f]ollow them that be-lieve: In my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." [##Mark 16:15-18##]All these gifts and graces were promised by Joseph and the early elders of the Church, just the same as by the ancient Apostles; and this is the testimony that every elder has borne from that day until the present. Has the Lord backed up this testimony? He has. All of the Twelve who have labored abroad, and we have been doing so, more or less, thirty or forty years,traveling hundreds of thousands of miles,—have made this declaration. I have preached to millions of my fellow-men in my own and other countries; and I and the other apostles, as well as hundreds of elders of this Church and Kingdom, have all made the same proclamation, to kings, princes, presidents and rulers and to the inhabit-ants of the earth wherever we have gone as far as we have had an opportunity and have had the privilege of opening our mouths. We have borne the same testimony to all—namely, that all who would receive our testimony and obey the Gospel should re-ceive the Holy Ghost. Would we have dared to go forth and bear this testimony if we had not known this was the work of God? No, there is not a man on the face of the earth who dare do it under any other circumstances, for his hypocrisy and decep-tion would soon have been apparent; the very first man that received his testimony would have proved it. Could we have gathered our hundreds of thousands from the nations of the earth if we had been de-ceivers, and had preached false doctrines? As the Apostle says, "But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] No, we should have had no success; we might have preached false doctrines until we were grey, or as old as Methusaleh, but if we had weshould never have seen Utah, this taberna-cle or these valleys of the mountains. But the Lord backed up our testimony, and tens of thousands throughout this Territory and in the world, who received it, can bear record that they have re-ceived the Holy Ghost, and the revelations of Jesus Christ, and that the gifts and graces of the gospel have followed them.This Church is organized exactly as it was anciently—with apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, gifts, helps and govern-ments. Are all apostles, or are all pro-phets? Do all have the gifts of healing, or do all speak with new tongues? No, but all these gifts and offices are in the Church, and, as the apostle says, they are placed there for the work of the ministry, for theedifying of the body of Christ, and for the perfecting of the Saints—until we are come to the unity of the faith, to the knowledge of the Son of God and to the fulness of the stature of a man in Christ Jesus. That is what they are given for, and they are needed just as much as they ever were in any gen-eration. But the world has been without these blessings and wandering in darkness for nearly eighteen centuries. Now the Lord has raised up a people to establish His Kingdom on the same foundation as an-ciently. This is the work of the Latter-day Saints. We have been called to warn this generation; we understand the signs of the times and know that the judgments of God are at hand. If we had not been faithful to our calling and mission, the Lord would have raised up another people, because the set time is at hand for Him to establish His Kingdom.There are one or two ideas more I wish to refer to, with regard to the mission of Christ. That mission did not end when He was crucified. When that event took place we are told that his body lay in the tomb for three days, and that His spirit went to preach to the spirits in prison, which some-time were disobedient when the long suf-fering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing. Jesus went and preached to them in the spirit that they might be judged according to men in the flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] Here is a principle of which the Christian world know nothing, and which has been revealed to us in our own day—namely, preaching the gospel of life and salvation to the spirits of those who pass away without rendering obedience there-unto. Nearly eighteen hundred years have passed away since God had a church upon the earth. In that time about fifty-four thousand millions of human beings have passed away without the gospel. Are they to perish because they lived in generations when God had no Church on the earth? No, they will be preached to by men who go into the spirit world, who hold the keys of the Kingdom of God, and the ordinances of the house of God will be administer-ed to them by their descendants and friends here on the earth. The Apostle Paul evi-dently had his mind on this subject when he says, "Why then are they baptized for the dead if the dead rise not?" [##1 Corinthians 15:29##]I do not know how fully Brother Benson has attended to the work for his dead, but I know that he has worked hard for the living; and when he goes into the spirit world and meets with those for whom he has been baptized and been the means of liberating them from prison in the spirit world, what joy he will have! And it will be so with others. And this work of administering the ordinances of the house of God to the dead, I may say, will require the whole of the millennium, with Jesus at the head of the resurrected dead to attend to it. The ordin-ances of salvation will have to be attended to for the dead who have not heard the gos-pel, from the days of Adam down before Christ can present this world to the Father and say "It is finished." [##John 19:30##]Brethren and sisters, let us be admonish-ed by the death of Brother Benson, and if we have anything to do let us do it. Let us go to and attend to our ordinances, then when we go to the spirit world and meet with father, mother brother or sister they cannot rise up and accuse us of negligence. I have attended to the ordinances for a great many of my friends, and I want you to do the same, so that when we get to the other side of the vail we may look back and be satisfied. This power has been placed in the hands of the Latter-day Saints, then let us go forth and use it for the salva-tion of the living and the dead. With re-gard to the unbelief of the world, it will not make the truth of God without effect. These ordinances have been revealed to us; we understand them, and unless we attend to them we shall fall under condemnation.I rejoice in the work of God and I rejoice to live in this day and age of the world. I want to live as long as I can do good; but not an hour longer than I can live in fel-lowship with the Holy Spirit, with my Father in heaven, my Savior and with the faithful Latter-day Saints. To live any longer than this would be torment and misery to me. When my work is done I am ready to go; but I want to do what is required of me. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe, both Jew and Greek. Let us be faithful, keep our covenants, do our duty, and at-tend to all the ordinances of the gospel as far as we can, both for ourselves and our dead. When we have done this we shall be satisfied. I pray that God may bless you; that he may bless the apostles who dwell on the earth; that His power may rest on the presiding Twelve, the Seven-ties, the High Priests, the Bishops, Elders, Teachers and Deacons, and all who have entered into covenant to keep His com-mandments. Let us be faithful and we shall obtain our reward; we shall overcome and obtain eternal life and a crown of glory if we magnify our calling by living the religion which we have received, which may God grant for Christ's sake, Amen. 
 upon the wicked, I will be inquired of byyou to ask the Father in my name to do andto perform these things for you, as I told all the house of Israel by my servant Moses thatthey should ask at my hand for all thoseblessings which I the Lord have promisedunto Israel in the latter days. And as Ithe Lord ordained mine apostles who were withme in my ministry, and promised themthat they should sit upon twelve thrones,judging the twelve tribes of Israel, so I sayunto you, mine apostles, whom I haveraised up in these last days, that I haveordained you to bear record of my name, and of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the Gen-tiles first, and then to the house of Israel. Ihave also ordained you to sit upon thronesand judge the Gentiles and all of the inhabi-tants of the earth unto whom you have bornetestimony of my name in the day and genera-tion in which you live. Therefore, how greatis your calling and responsibility before me!Therefore, gird up the loins of your minds andmagnify your calling in the fear of God, andprepare ye for the coming of the Son of Man,which is nigh at the door. No man knoweth

 did not believe in any more revelation.This would be a great mistake. For if we had before us every revelation whichGod ever gave to man; if we had the Book of Enoch; if we had the untrans-lated plates before us in the Englishlanguage; if we had the records of theRevelator St. John which are sealed up,and all other revelations, and they werepiled up here a hundred feet high, theChurch and kingdom of God could notgrow, in this or any other age of the world, without the living oracles ofGod.The Presidency of the Church is com-posed of three men—the President andhis Counselors; and not only does thePresident of the Church need revela-tion daily, in order to pass through thelabor, the care and the business thatrests upon him, but his Counselors needit. Every one of the Twelve Apostlesneed it in all their administrationsthroughout the world; and not only theTwelve Apostles, but the Seventies, theHigh Priests, the Bishops, the Eldersand all who belong to the Melchisedecor Aaronic Priesthood—all need it intheir administrations in the world. Noman can go forth and lift up his voice anddeclare the Gospel of Jesus Christ with-out revelation. He needs the HolyPriesthood with him; he needs the HolyGhost with him every day of his life. I do not wish to be misunderstood in thismatter. Every man or woman that hasever entered into the Church of Godand been baptized for the remission ofsins, has a right to revelation; yes,women have a right to revelation, aright to the Spirit of God, to assistthem in their labors, in their administra-tions to their children, in counseling their children and those over whomthey are called to preside. The HolyGhost is not restricted to men, nor toApostles or Prophets, it belongs to everyfaithful man and woman, and to everychild who is old enough to receive the Gospel of Christ.I am very much opposed to falsedoctrine, either preaching it myself orhaving anybody else preach it. I there-fore wish to make this correction if thereis any need of it. God never had a Church or a people, in any age of theworld, that were ever governed and con-trolled except by revelation. The living oracles of God were among them—thosewho held the keys of the Kingdom, andthey had to receive revelation to assistthem in all their work. The Elders ofIsrael, when they go abroad to thenations of the earth, need the Spirit ofGod, to tell them to go here, or gothere, that they may search out the honest in heart. Let us all understand this, so that we may not be divided inour views and sentiments. 
 Sacramento Aug 6thDear Br WoodruffBy the request of Br Garlick,I write to let you know how we are doing in Sacramento. Br Lowba came here last fall and organized a branch of the Church,since then we have held meetings every Sunday, and have had a good degree of the Holy Spirit, in its light, and Intelligence.The old saints who are here mostly belong to the young Josephites, and do not come to our meetings. If any of the Elders should be coming this way Br Garlick would like them to call on him, he lives on Secondstreet between N and O streets, we have had one letter from Br Lowba from New York,he could not find any saints there. It seems to me that the Old saints have got into a state of darkness in regard to the old Church,and their minds are no longer enlightenedby the spirit of Truth, and having lost that, they are liable to be deceived by anything that comes along, here we find some of themSpiritualists, some Second Adventists, some Josephits, but in themselves seem to have no true foundation, so that when Christ comes they will be found among the foolish virgins with their lamps gone out, and no oil or light of the Holy Spirit to replenish them.

 their families for several years at a time, but now the key is turned to the seed of Israel, they are right herein our midst scattered abroad amongthese mountains. "What," says one, "preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ tothese natives?" Yes, God has deter-mined that seeing the Gentiles countthemselves unworthy of eternal life,he will through the instrumentalityof his servants cause salvation to goto Israel in the mountains, and fulfil thepromises which were made to theirfathers hundreds of years ago. Whenyou see the servitude in which thepoor of mankind are kept in thevarious nations, and the privations,abominations, and oppression that grind down the inhabitants of the earth, does it not make us feel forthem? And to whom can they lookfor deliverance? They never will find it but through the instrumental-ity of this people, for into their handthe kingdom is given never more to be destroyed, but it will spread and increase until all have had an oppor-tunity of receiving the truth in all nations. And those that will not keep the commandments of God willfeel his chastening rod, for he will purify and cleanse the earth that itmay be prepared for the coming ofChrist.The kingdom of God will remainupon the earth, and the holy Priest-hood will rest down upon these ourneighbours as well as we, and the keys of power will remain with thispeople for ever and be used for theirredemption, for this is the decree of the Almighty. If we do not do our duty as a people we shall be chastenedand whipped until we learn obedience.Then, I say, that it is for us to work to build up his kingdom, whatever we are instructed to do, that we should perform at all times and listento the counsels of his servants what-ever may be the consequences. Yes, brethren, the time is at hand when we are and shall be required to put forth our hands and do a great workupon the earth, and the dead branchesmust be cut off in order that theremay be room for the kingdom of Godto grow. We see the jud[g]ments of God spreading among the nations ofthe earth, and what are our feelings? My feelings are, that it is according to the prophecies of those men whowere inspired in days that are gone.Well, do I delight in seeing the wicked destroyed? No, I do not; butI delight in seeing the righteous getwhat they look for, happiness and eternal life. Is it a benefit for the wicked portion of mankind to live orto die and go down to the grave? It is better for the people to go down tothe grave than to live upon the earth;when the principles of salvation are offered to the world, it is better that they should cease to live than bring thousands of posterity into the worldwho will like themselves do wickedly,for the wicked and the ungodlyof the earth will not receive theGospel of Christ, and the earth isbound to be cleansed that there maybe room for the righteous to live, fora holy and righteous generation to beraised up and the name of God honoured among men. These are my feelings upon that subject. And it will be just so with us, we will be under greater condemnation than anyother people if we neglect our duties, because we have received the Priest-hood of God, and have learned what is right and what is wrong. How many of our brethren now present before the light of revelation came felt as we do now? Would we not have given anything in the worldthat we possessed to have had theprivilege of listening to the teachingswe have had this day? We werethen like the blind groping for thewall, and all we had to do was to walk by the little light we could get.We were then filled with traditions of 
 the day nor the hour. But the signs of bothheaven and earth indicate his coming, as pro-mised by the mouths of my disciples. The figtree is leaving and the hour is nigh. Therefore, prepare yourselves, O ye Saints of the Most HighGod, with oil in your lamps, for blessed is hethat watcheth for the coming of the Son of Man.Again, hear ye the word of the Lord,O ye mine apostles, whom I have chosen inthese last days to bear record of my nameand to lead my people Israel until thecoming of the Son of Man, I the Lord haveraised up unto you my servant John Tay-lor to preside over you and to be a lawgiverunto my church. He has mingled ^his blood^ with thatof the martyred prophets. Nevertheless, while I have taken my servants Joseph and Hyrumunto myself, I have preserved my servant John Taylor for a wise purpose in me. Ihave also taken many others of the apostlesunto myself, for I take whom I will take,and preserve in life whom I will preserve, ac-cording to the counsel of my own will. Andwhile my servant John Taylor is your pres-ident, I wish to ask the rest of my servantsof the apostles the question, Although you have

 Noticed in HistoryMarch 3rd 1853  Note to JournalBro WoodruffDear Sir, my clerk has negulected someof the most important items connected with thebreaking out of the Small-pox in our compa^n^y.When it ^was^ discouvered that this loathsome disease wasin our midst, a general feeling of horror siezed theCapt & crew, & many of the Saints. The Captwanted to turn about & put in to some portof Spain or Portugal. Said he would loose halfhis Sailors. Would be compeled to lay inQuarantine 2 or 3 months if we proceeded toNew Orleans &c. &cI opposed turing back in the strongest terms& told the Capt ^in the name of the Lord^ that if he would proceed, notone of his Sailors should be sick, & that we wouldnot be detained one hour in Quarantine.Well, said he I will go, on & if it is as you say I willpromise that I will believe you to be a prophet& that there is something in mormonism, whetherI am ever a mormon or not.When we got to New Orleans, we were pronouncedthe healthiest company that ever sailed into thatport. The Capt left me with tears, & saidMr Young, God grant we may meet again.I mention this circumstance to show that 
 before the God of heaven—and sowill all men—for the course I pursuein this life.There is one very peculiar feature with regard to the followers of JesusChrist, or those that have attemptedin other dispensations to obey the law of heaven, and that is, their unpopularity in the world from thedays of Father Adam to the presenttime. Trace it through from thebeginning, and you will find that menwho were inspired by Almighty God to go forth and proclaim any mes-sage to the inhabitants of the earth,have been most unpopular in their day and generation. You will find it has been so in the whole historyof the world. You may go back, forinstance, to the days of Noah. Noah was a preacher of righteousness. Hewas called of God. He was warnedof God, and told what to do to save himself and family. The world had become terribly corrupt, and it wasnecessary that the people be called upon to repent. To this end God Almighty raised up a prophet. Thatprophet was Noah. He went forth as he was commanded and preachedthe Gospel of Jesus Christ in its purity and truth. He was commanded to build an ark on dry land. Thepeople laughed at him and wouldnot believe his testimony. For onehundred and twenty years hewarned the inhabitants of the earthof the coming flood; but all that he could save were the members of hisown family, some eight souls. The flood came, and all the inhabitantsof the earth, save those who had entered the ark, were drowned. [##Genesis 6-7##]Their spirits were shut up in prison in the spirit world, and they re-mained there until after the death of Jesus Christ; and while His body lay in the tomb three and a halfdays He went and preached to thosespirits in prison, where they hadbeen shut up for thousands of years. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##]As it was with Noah so it waswith other Prophets who lived in ancient days. You may trace thehistory of Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,Isaiah, and the rest down to thedays of Jesus Christ, and you find they were all unpopular in their day and generation. In consequenceof the wickedness that prevailedin the world, those Prophets weremoved upon to prophesy concerningthe destruction of Babylon the great, [##Jeremiah 50##] Ninevah, [##Nahum 1-3##] Tyre, [##Ezekiel 26##] and many other ancient cities; they declaredthe word of the Lord to the inhab-itants of these cities, but theirtestimony was not believed; and because of their unpopularity, the Prophets were put to death. Nevertheless, not one jot or tittleof their predictions fell to the ground unfulfilled. [##Matthew 5:18##]Then, again, you come along down to the days of Jesus Christ. You trace His life from His birth in a stable to the tomb. Was ever a man on the earth—a good man like the Savior—so persecuted, opposed, ridiculed and derided as Hewas by the Jews, Pharisees, Sad-ducees, and the different sects ofthat day? No matter what He did it was attributed to him for evil. IfHe cast out devils it was attributedto the power of Beelzebub. [##Matthew 12:22-37##] If He restored the blind to sight, they were ready to cry out, "You giveGod the glory, this man is a sinner."And so in all His works was He opposed, persecuted and derided. And His Apostles shared the same fate. Every soul of them—with the exception of John—had to lay downtheir lives and seal their testimony with their blood. Some werebeheaded, some were sawn asunder.Even in the case of John theysought his life, but it was decreed

 M. J. EllingwoodWhitewater, Wis., June 30, 1892.Pres. Wilford Woodruff, Dear Sir:Your favor of June ninth was received, and we wish to thank you for your kindness. I should have written before, but have been thinking some one might see the piece in the paper that knew my son and so give me some information concerning him.But as yet we have heard nothing about him. Some one told me that about ayear ago some of the Mormons went to New Mexico to build a railroad. Do you know of any body that went? If you do, and would send me their names I would write to them and would be greatly obliged to you for your assistance. Do you know of any way in which I can obtain any knowledge concerning him? Do you think if his father should go out there he could 
 one to preside over your quorum, which is theorder of God in all generations, do you not, all of you, hold the apostleship, which is thehighest authority ever given to men on theearth? You do. Therefore, you hold incommon the keys of the kingdom of Godin all the world. You each of you havepower to unlock the vail of eternity andhold converse with God the Father, andhis son Jesus Christ, and to have theadministration of angels. It is yourright, privilege, and duty to inquire ofthe Lord as to his mind and will concerningyourselves and the inhabitants of Zion andtheir interests. And whenever any one ofyou receives the word of the Lord, let it bewritten and presented in your councils. And whatever, by united consent, you deemwisdom to be presented unto the people, let it be presented by the president, my servantJohn Taylor, as the word of the Lord. Inthis way you will uphold him and strength-en his hands, as all the burden should notlie upon one man. For thus saith theLord, All mine apostles should be full of theHoly Ghost, of inspiration and revelation, to know 
 544 THE DESERET NEWS. Dec. 22.the earth are honoring God, acknowledg-ing His hand in all things and keeping Hiscommandments? Very few. Just the same to-day as in the days of Noah. We read that one of a family and two of a city will be gathered to Zion in the last days. Out of twelve hundred millions, that dwellon the face of the earth, we, after fortyyears' labor, have succeeded in gathering a few thousands together to the valleys of the mountains. The numbers are veryfew; [b]ut this few should be faithful.Last Sabbath, those who were here, list-ened to a discourse from Bro. Geo. Q.Cannon, in which he delivered his testi-mony concerning Joseph Smith and Presi-dent Young. I thought to myself, it seemeda kind of a queer idea that, at this late date,one of the Apostles should be called upon,to stand up in the sacred desk and defend the characters of these men as prophets andapostles. Yet so it was, and these thingsare necessary.Joseph Smith was what he professed tobe, a prophet of God, a seer and revelator. He laid the foundation of this church andkingdom, and lived long enough to deliverthe keys of the kingdom to the elders of Israel, unto the Twelve Apostles. He spentthe last winter of his life, some three or fourmonths, with the quorum of the Twelveteaching them. It was not merely a fewhours ministering to them the ordinances of the Gospel; but he spent day after day, week after week and month after month, teaching them and a few others the things of the kingdom of God. Said he, duringthat period, "I now rejoice. I have liveduntil I have seen this burden, which has rested on my shoulders, rolled on to theshoulders of other men; now the keys of the kingdom are planted on the earth to betaken away no more for ever." But until he had done this, they remained with him;and had he been taken away they wouldhave had to be restored by messengers out of heaven. But he lived until every key,power and principle of the holy priesthoodwas sealed on the Twelve and on PresidentYoung, as their President. He told us that he was going away to leave us, goingaway to rest. Said he, "you have to roundup your shoulders to bear off the kingdom. No matter what becomes of me, I havedesired to see that Temple built, but I shall not live to see it. You will; you are called upon to bear of this kingdom." This lan-guage was plain enough, but we did not understand, it any more than the disciplesof Jesus when he told them He was goingaway, and that if he went not the Comforterwould not come. It was just so with Jos-eph. He said this time after time to theTwelve and to the Female Relief Societiesand in his public discourses; but none of us seemed to understand that he was going to seal his testimony with his blood, but so it was. What he said to us and the church we have had to perform. Joseph Smith wasa good man, a prophet of God. His works are before the world; they are before theeyes of the nation; they are before the hea-vens and the earth. The foundation that he laid we have built upon until the pres-ent day; and that foundation no power on earth or in hell will ever be able to remove.That church and kingdom of God that is planted here in these valleys of the moun-tains will remain on the earth until the little stone Daniel saw will become a moun-tain and fill the earth, until the reign of Jesus is supreme and universal.It startles men when they hear the Elders of Israel tell about the kingdoms ofthis world becoming the kingdom of our God and His Christ. They say it is trea-son for men to teach that the kingdom Dan-iel saw is going to be set up, and bear rule over the whole earth. Is it treason for GodAlmighty to govern the earth? Who madeit? God, did He not? Who made you? God, if you have any eternal Father. Wellwhose right is it to rule and reign over youand the earth? It does not belong to the devil, nor to men. It has never been givento men yet; it has never been given to the nations. It belongs solely to God and Heis coming to rule and reign over it. Whenwill that be? It may not be perfected un-til Christ comes in the clouds of heavenwith power and great glory to reward everyman according to the deeds done in thebody. That kingdom, the germ of whichis planted here, will continue to grow andwill never be overthrown. As I said before,no matter what takes place outside of thisTerritory—we as Latter-day Saints shouldexercise faith in God, for just as sure as God was true to Daniel, Moses, Noah, Enoch and to the prophets and Apostles, sowill He be true to us; so will He be true toHis word in these latter days and will ful-fill all He has said.This is the work we have to perform. Itis a good work, a great work, a gloriouswork, and one in which the Latter-day Saints should rejoice, for it confers uponthem the privilege of being instruments inthe hands of God of helping to build up His kingdom on the earth. This should give us joy, and the promises made to us in con-nection with this work ought to sustain usand give us hope, joy, and consolation.I have been happy since I formed theacquaintance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: I was never satisfied until I found the Lat-ter-day Saints. In my boyhood I couldread in the Bible and New Testament of a people who had power with God, who hadthe gifts and graces, who could command the elements and they obeyed them; whohad power to heal the sick, and had thegifts of the Holy Ghost imparted unto them by God himself. That was the kindof religion I always desired to live to see. I desired to live to see a prophet and anApostle, or some man who was inspired of God who could teach me the way to besaved. I have lived to see that day.I rejoice in it for I know it is true. I know this work is true. I know it isthe kingdom of God, as you do, and asall men do who have received the testimonyof the Holy Spirit and have been faithful for themselves.As to President Young his labors have been with us. It has been remarked some-times, by certain individuals, that President Young has said in public that he was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet. I havetraveled with him since 1833 or the spring of 1834; I have travelled a good many thou-sand miles with him and have heard him preach a great many thousand ser-mons; but I have never heard him make that remark in my [l]ife. He is a prophet, I am a prophet, you are, andanybody is a prophet who has the testi-mony of Jesus Christ, for that is the spiritof prophecy. The Elders of Israel are pro-phets. A prophet is not so great as an apostle. Christ has set in his Church, first, apostles; they hold the keys of the kingdomof God. Any man who has travelled with President Young knows he is a prophet of God. He has foretold a great many thingsthat have come to pass. All the Saints whoare well acquainted with him know that he is governed and controlled by the power of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ. His works are before the world; they arebefore the heavens; before the earth; beforethe wicked as well as the righteous; and it is the influence of President Young thatthe world is opposed to. This Priesthood,these keys of the Kingdom of God thathave been sealed upon him, the world is at war against; let them say what they may, these things are what they are at enmity with. Their present objection to the Latter-day Saints, they say, is plurality of wives. It is this principle they are trying to raise a persecution against now. But how was it in Missouri, Kirtland, Jackson county, Far West, Caldwell county, in all our drivings and afflictions, before this principle was revealed to the Church? Cer-tainly it was not polygamy then. No, it was prophets, it was revelation, it was theorganization of an institution founded by revelation from God. They did not believein that, and that was the objection in those days. If we were to do away with poly-gamy, it would only be one feather in the bird, one ordinance in the Church and Kingdom. Do away with that, then we must do away with prophets and apostles, with revelation and the gifts and graces of the Gospel, and finally give up our religion altogether and turn sectarians and do as the world does, then all would be right. We just can't do that, for God has commanded us to build up His Kingdom and to bearour testimony to the nations of the earth,and we are going to do it, come life or comedeath. He has told us to do thus, and we shall obey Him in days to come as we havein days past.Brethren and sisters, let us exercise faith;the ancient prophets lived by faith; it is asnecessary for us as for them. I believe what God has said will be fulfilled. I be-lieve the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covena[n]ts will be fulfilled,and all the promises and prophecies madeby the faithful servants of God. When any man speaks as he is moved upon bythe Holy Ghost, that is the word of God to the people; and though the heavens andthe earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of the word of God will fall unfulfilled. I care not whether it be by His own voiceout of the heavens; by the ministration ofangels; by the voice of a prophet, or by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost through His servants, it is the word of God to the people; it is truth and it will have its effectand fulfillment. Everything that has been communicated to us by revelation I believeto be true; many of them I know. I have faith and knowledge, both in a degree. I want more; I wish for more, and all I askis that the Lord will enable me to be faith-ful. I wish eternal life. I want salvation. This is the object of my life; for this I em-braced "Mormonism." This is the princi-ple that has sustained me from the time I entered this church and kingdom. Thishope sustained me when I shouldered my knapsack and went forth to travel and preach without purse or scrip, thousandsof miles through the United States. Thisprinciple of inspiration has sustained the elders of Israel in every age of the world. It is that which sustained Joseph Smith from the day he commenced his career as a servant of God until the time that he sealed his testimony with his blood. Some-body has got to pay the bill for the shed-ding of that innocent blood. Shedding in-nocent blood has cost the Jews eighteen hundred years of suffering, mourning, woe and destruction; it has cost this nation already four years of war, with two millionsof men laid in the dust, and four thousand million dollars in money; and woe be to that nation, tongue or people that sheds the blood of the Saints of God, or under-takes to oppose the work of God in this or any other generation. They will have to reap what they sow; for what you sow you will reap, and the reward you mete will be rewarded to you again, whether you are Saints or sinners, in all nations, kindreds, tongues and people under the whole heav-ens.This is the position that we occupy. This warfare is not between man and man but between God and the world. If the Lorddoes not defend the Latter-day Saints we cannot defend ourselves. We can do what is required of us, but God, Himself, has to defend us. He has done it and He will continue to do it until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, or until his Kingdomtriumphs on the earth. This is my faith;and I would rather, to-day, lay down mylife, honoring the faith once delivered to theSaints, than turn round and fear men, who have power only to kill the body, instead of fearing Him who has power to cast both soul and body into hell. Salvation is of more consequence to me and to this people, and to all the inhabitants of the earth, than anything else. What is the world with its honors, gold, silver, thrones, principalities and powers compared with salvation? Theyall end at death, they are of no force after, and are of no moment when compared with eternal salvation. Oh, what glorious principles have been revealed to the Latter-day Saints! Where did you get them? How did you obtain them? Through the voice of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young by revelation from God. That is the way we obtained them. The principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ have power and efficacy after death; they will bring together men and their wives and children in the familyorganization and will re-unite them worlds without end. The power of those who situpon thrones in this life will end at their death; they will have no extra power in the world to come because they have occupied thrones in this. The Czar of Russia, the Emperor of France, the Queen of England, or any other sovereign, will not have anyadditional power in the world to come because of their present glory. It will all end with their death. These are the king-doms of men, they are not ordained of God.True, they will be held accountable for the exercise of their power here; God will holdthem responsible for that, but so far assalvation and glory hereafter are concernedtheir exalted positions here will not avail them anything. There is not a man who has lived since the Church went into the wilderness and the Kingdom of God wastaken from the earth, until Moroni rent the vail and gave to Joseph Smith the records of the Book of Mormon, and until Peter, James and John sealed upon him the keys of the Holy Priesthood, who can claim a wife in the resurrection. Not one of themhas been married for eternity, but only until death. But unto the Latter-day Saints the sealing ordinances have beenrevealed, and they will have effect after death, and, as I have said, will re-unitemen and women eternally in the family organization. Herein is why these princi-ples are a part of our religion, and by them husbands and wives, parents and childrenwill be re-united until the links in the chain are re-united back to Father Adam. We could not obtain a fullness of celestial glory without this sealing ordinance or theinstitution called the patriarchal order of marriage, which is one of the most gloriousprinciples of our religion. I would just as lief the United States Government would pass a law against my being baptized for theremission of my sins, or against my re-ceiving the Holy Ghost, as against my practising the patriarchal order of mar-riage. I would just as lief they would takeaway any other principle of the Gospel as this. The opinion of men generally, in relation to this subject, is that the Latter-day Saints practise it for the gratification of their carnal desires; but such ideas are wholly untrue. The world seek after this; but the Saints of God practise this principlethat they may partake of eternal lives, that they may have wives and posterity in the world to come and throughout the endless ages of eternity.God promised to Abraham that his seed should be as numerous as the stars in the heaven or as the sands on the sea shore. We all know, from reading the history of Abraham, that this promise has not been fulfilled, for you may take one square yard of sand on the sea shore, and thegrains it would contain would be morenumerous than all the inhabitants that ever lived on the earth; hence this promise of the Lord could not be fulfilled if, as the Christian world imagine, the marriage re-lation ceases with the termination of this life, and that after the resurrection there isno increase. But in the resurrection there will be no end to the increase of Abraham,it will continue through all eternity.These are some of the principles of the Gospel God has revealed to us. Are they not worth living for and having faith in? They are. Then do not fear because of the wicked. We have everythingto encourage us. The Latterday Saints should be faith-ful. We should live our religion and be true and faithful to our covenants. Weshould magnify our callings as Apostles,Elders and Saints, before God angels and men. We have but little time to work, and we should work while it is called to-day;by and by night comes when no man canwork. When the vision of my mind isopened and I gaze abroad upon this genera-tion, I many times feel to mourn in my spirit to see the darkness and unbelief and the carelessness of man with regard to hisfuture and eternal state. Instead of seek-ing with all their powers to secure to them-selves eternal life they seem to be doing their utmost to turn the last key to seal their condemnation and to make them-selves the sons of perdition. They will labor to shed innocent blood and to destroy the Church and kingdom of Godon the earth. This is one of the promptingsof the evil one.There are two things which have always followed apostates in every age of the world, and especially in our day. In theearly days of the Church, in Kirtland, as soon as men apostatized from the Church and Kingdom of God, they immediately began to fear their fellow men, and to fancy their lives were in danger. Another pecu-liarity common to apostates was that they desired to kill those who had been their benefactors. This was the case with the Higbees, Laws and others with regard to the Prophet Joseph, when they turned against him, they sought with all theirpowers to take away his life. Not only were they afraid of their own lives, butthey sought to take his, and they eventually succeeded, and woe is their doom. Whatwould they not give in exchange for their souls? But no matter, they cannot redeem them. This spirit always accompanies the apostates. What are they afraid of? There is something they do not understand or comprehend; they walk in the dark, and by and by they will unite with the wicked and try to overthrow the very work they have been trying to build up.This spirit has always been with the en-emies of rightousness. The devil seeks to overthrow the kingdom of God and the Saints, and he always will do it as long ashe has any power on the earth; therefore we should be united. We should be faith-ful and labor hard to do what we have todo and not put off anything for the build-ing up of the kingdom of God. We should obey all the ordinances we can for our-selves and our children; for the living and the dead. We should attend to these thingsas we go along, and when we get through with our work and into the spirit world, we may look back and be satisfied with our labors. There is a great deal for the Latter-day Saints to do. We have done a good deal, but the work is only just com-menced. Zion is not what she must be;Zion is growing. She has grown since we came to the valleys of the mountains. Wehave done something for the living: we have warned the nations; the garments of many of us are clear of the blood of this generation. It cannot rise in judgment against Joseph Smith, Brigham Young or the Twelve Apostles, nor against thousands of the elders of this church and kingdom. We have lifted up our voices day and night:we have preached to millions of our fellow men and have travelled hundreds of thous-ands of miles to offer this gospel to the na-tions of the earth. Still they have turned against us, and a great many of them have sought our overthrow. They will receive their reward and we shall receive ours.What joy, consolation and satisfaction it will be to the apostles, elders and Saints of God, of this day, who remain true and faith-ful to the end! having become members of the church of the Firstborn, and been val-iant in the testimony of Jesus, when theymeet Father Adam, Enoch, Jacob, Isaiah,Jeremiah, Jesus and the apostles, how greattheir joy will be! They labored in their day for the work of God, and their toils are over; we are having our day and our labor. By and by we shall meet and mingle in the eternal world. How fast we pass away! Where is Bro.Heber, whom we used to see so often in our midst here and in the En-dowment House? In the spirit world.Bro. Willard[,] Joseph, Hyrum, David Pat-ton, Jedediah, Parley Pratt, and Bro. Ben-son among the rest, have gone. We shallall go pretty soon, we shall not remain a great while. Our labors in this life are short, and we shall soon pass to the other side of the vail. Our children, the risinggeneration, will possess the kingdom; on them the labor of rolling on the work of God will rest, until the kingdom and thegreatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven will be given to the Saints of the Most High and they will possess it for ever and ever, and the meek will inherit the earth. Let us be diligent, let us be faithful; let us labor while it is called to-day, that we may be counted worthy to receive areward that will satisfy us in the end.I pray that God will bless us, that Hewill pour out His spirit upon us and giveus the testimony of Jesus Christ; that wemay guard our welfare, and watch our-selves that our feet may not slip. It is an awful thing for a man, in any generation, to receive this gospel, to taste the good wordof God and the powers of the world to come, and then turn away and lose the testi-mony of Jesus and turn against God; such a man's condition is worse than his who never heard the gospel of Christ. Hewill lament and mourn, and that too, without ever receiving redemption. Suchindividuals cannot be redeemed and re-stored to that which they have forfeited.It is far better to receive the gospel and befaithful in the midst of all opposition. If we continue so, when we meet with the fathers we can rejoice with them and par-take of the same kingdom and the same glory; quickened by the same spirit, hav-ing kept the same law and been preserved thereby.May God bless us all and help us to over-come the world, the flesh and the devil, for Jesus sake. Amen.

 our fathers who had inherited vanity,lies, and things in which there wasno profit. Things are different now, we know for ourselves, we understandthe things of God, then let us obey for ourselves that we may prosper. I feel an anxiety for the welfare of this people, and I pray that we maynot neglect the blessings that are given to us, for this is an importanttime. While we are in this proba-tion we should make the best possible use of our time, for this is the time to receive life and knowledge and tolay up treasures in heaven, that whereour heart is, there our treasures maybe also. There are many things inmy mind to speak upon for thebenefit of this people, but I do notfeel to occupy your time longer. I do feel though that the subject before us is of all importance to the house of Israel, and I believe that the Lord does intend that we should speak tothem, and bring them to understandthe light of truth. They are in darkness, because their fathers hadthe truth and turned away and forsookthe Lord their God. The Prophetsamong them wrote records, and in those records they promised blessingsto their children who should live in the last days. They promised thatafter the cursing and afflictions shouldcome the blessings, and if the Lordhas taken us from the midst of the Gentiles and has enlightened our minds so that we can comprehendlife and death in a great measure,and the principles of truth that arebeing revealed, we should feel satis-fied with the blessings God has given,and we should be as ready to preach to these Lamanites as we are to the Gentiles. Are they not of the seed of Israel? Are they not all our brethren and of the house of Joseph?Then, brethren, let us take heed, andwhen we look upon them and see their conditions deal with them wisely, and the Lord will acknowledgeour labours. I will tell you what I believe about this matter—the redemption of these natives—had thispeople come here under the sameimpressions that they had in New York, in Ohio, in Kentucky, or inMaine, or in any other State, had theycome when they first received the Gospel and the Spirit of it, for thentheir hearts were touched with theSpirit of the Gospel of salvation, andthey felt well, and had they have come here under those impressionsand continued to live under thoseimpressions which they first receivedin relation to these scattered tribes; I say long before this, had the peoplewho first settled in Utah Valley lived up to the first impressions first madeupon their minds, these Utes would have felt to be our brethren and sisters. They would have been one with us, and they would have beenin this Church long ago, and their children would have been readingand writing, and you would have seensome of the young men busily engagedpreaching to the tribes the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If theLatter-day Saints had come herewhen they first received the impression, and the Book of Mormon fromJoseph Smith, this wild degradedrace of men might have been, to agreat extent, civilized and acquaintedwith the Gospel. What do you say brethren, is not that correct? (Loudcries of "Yes.") I know it is. Ihave heard the brethren and sistersspeak in tongues and give interpre-tations about this very people, and they would say that they would teachthe Lamanites to spin and sew, and also to be clean; do they feel so now? No; I tell you they are back-sliders from that faith which theythen imbibed; they are lukewarmand cold to those things which Godhas taught us respecting this peoplewith whom we now live.

 Beloit, Kansas, May 20th 1892Dear Sir: I am editing a wirk for a largepublishing house in N. Y. City, in the interestof Sunday Schools, and private instruction,upon a unique place.In our "Common-place" I say,'The Mormon Church is not known to haveadapted officially the Oxford Bible (containingKing James Version And Anglican Margins)?Years ago I saw "The Book of Mormon";but, ^do not^ recollect whether it was an addition to theStandard; or whether it was [intrudid] tosupersede.My first series will go on, in manuscript,in 3 weeks; & I should like to have any statementabout you substantially correct.Hence please answer the following —1. Do you use and recommend the 'Oxford' entire?and [ink blot]2. Are you in harmony with the AmericanBible Society in its reprint of the body of theOxford Reference Bible?3. Is the Mormon Body, like the remainder of christendom,universally & uniformly hostile (in sentiment) towardall sectarian texts and margins?I wish to say further, that my enquiries 
 back a little you will see that we have been for several years past calling for the Elders to go forth andpreach the Gospel, and we havealmost preached to all nations. Theremay be some nations that we have not preached to, but we have preachedit in France, Italy, Germany, and the States of the German Confederacy; and it has been preached in the British Isles, in North and SouthAmerica, and the Society and Sand-wich Islands, and to China, and wehave even sent them to the dark regions of Asia and Africa to preachthe Gospel of Christ. There weretwo of our brethren past throughhere last night who have been to those countries. Chauncey West hasbeen through that country and can tell how it is there. Could he get any converts there? Yes, if he could get them plenty to eat, but if hecould not feed them and keep them they would not stay with him. Now Chauncey West has done as much ashe could, and not only preached andtravelled, but he has cleared his skirts of those people among whomhe has travelled, and he has clearedthis people, for they have been commanded to preach this Gospel toall the nations of the earth.Do we want to save the Lamanites? Yes, we do, and they are here by thousands and hundreds of thousands,right upon this continent; we have them all around us and they want saving. Supposing we were to takethose Elders that we have in the various nations and send them inamong these Indians, these nativesof the mountains, what would be theresult? Our Elders go and leavetheir families for two, three, fiveand seven years, they leave all and travel by land and sea, theyget shipwrecked, go almost naked,and be gone for years, preach-ing and labouring year after year,and what do they accomplish? Not as much as they could do athome in one month, but still they go,and positively don't do as much goodas they could do at home in onefourth the time. Now, suppose Iwere to call for Missionaries to goand preach the Gospel to the nations that are termed the civilized nations, I could get hundreds of volunteers. Whyare you not willing to make sacrificeshere? Why should not men be willingto go and spend their time and talentsamong these Lamanites and save time,money, and hundreds and thousands ofdollars? Let a man till his garden, attend to the cows, get his living and devote the spare portion of his time to preaching to these Lamanites, andand he will be right at home all thetime. But men will prefer going andspending their time year after year among the Gentile nations, and accomplish a mere nothing. And Ican find men in this congregation who will do this, and do it freely,but say to them set your own timeand go to the kanyon and get a load ofwood for these Lamanite squaws andwill they do it? No, they will not.Is it not strange that men will actso, go from home and spend hundredsand thousands of dollars to preachthe Gospel to somebody of noted civilization, away off yonder (pointingeast,) but will we go to the Laman-ites? No, but we try to get away off from them. We are treating them just as the Latter-day Saintshave been treated by the Gentiles. Ifany of them come about begging, theLatter-day Saints instead of serving them and thereby kindling a good spirit within them say "here, get out of the way, let this alone, anddon't you meddle with that, I don'tlike you, go away from my house."This is the way the Saints talk to these natives. Now, where shall we go—to the nations that have rejectedthe fulness of the Gospel, or shall we stay at home and preach to these

 times, Jesus gave his disciples tounderstand that there was but oneGospel. He told them what it was. He declared unto them its ordi-nances. He commissioned themto preach the Gospel to every crea-ture. In the first place they were to preach faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; next, repentance of sins; next, baptism for the remission ofsins. Baptism was an ordinance taught by the Savior himself. Wefind, too, that He obeyed this ordi-nance, being baptized in the river Jordan by John the Baptist. Why? To fulfill all righteousness. It was a righteous law, and it was a type ofbaptism to be followed by the wholehuman family. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; buthe that believeth not shall be damned." Such was the declarationof the Savior to the twelve Apostles.People were to be "buried with himby baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead bythe glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."What next? Men bearing the Mel-chisedek Priesthood—Apostles andElders—had the authority to lay hands upon baptized believers forthe reception of the Holy Ghost,which they received and which led them to prophecy of the things of the kingdom of God; and the signsfollowed those that believed. Thesewere the first principles of the Gos-pel. And Paul the Apostle, makesthis declaration: "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach anyother Gospel than that which wehave preached unto you, let him be accursed." He repeats this, and goes on to tell us what the Gospel is, and what the Church of Christis, and what it always has been. In the Church were Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, Evange-lists, etc., and these were "for theperfecting of the Saints, for thework of the ministry, for the edify-ing of the body of Christ: till we allcome in the unity of the faith andof the knowledge of the Son of God,unto a perfect man, unto the mea-sure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." The Lord never had—and never will have to the end oftime—a Church on the earth withoutProphets, Apostles, and inspired men.Whenever the Lord had a people on the earth that He acknowledged as such, that people were led by reve-lation. No man can find anythingcontrary to this. When the Gos-pel was given to the Jews, all thegifts and graces and powers thereof,accompanied it. It was accompanied by the Eternal Priesthood—which is after the order of the Son of God,without which no man can ad-minister in the ordinances of lifeand salvation. The Savior was a Jew himself. He came to His ownfather's house, but they rejected him and put him to death. TheGospel was then taken from the Jews and carried to the Gentiles. Paul warned the Gentiles to take heedlest they too fell into unbelief. But the Gospel was delivered tothem with all its blessings and powers, and remained with them as long as there was a man upon the earth that had the power to admin-ister in its ordinances.Now, have the Gentiles had that church and kingdom of God in theirmidst since the ancient Apostleswere put to death? I think not. At the present time there are somesix hundred three score and six different religions—different roadsto heaven and to hell—in theworld; but none of these bear much resemblance to the Gospel as taughtby Jesus Christ and His Apostles.The whole Christian world to-dayrises up against these Latter-day

 2 Britannia ChambersLawson StLondonEnglandMay, 23rd 1892To President WoodruffThe TabernacleSalt Lake City U. S. A.Reverend SirAs a stranger I must apologise for taking the liberty of addressing you but I am deputed by the to write this letter on behalf of thewife and children of Brother Goalen a member and Elder of the Church of Latter Day Saints, as it has been found impossible by his silence from gleaning any intelligence from him.  Brother Goalen left London last May (1891) leaving behind his wife and 5 little children (all under 12) including an infant of 5 months old.Prior to his departure (which he had arranged and carried out very quickly) he faithfully promised that he would send home regular weekly remittances so to maintain his wife and family. This pledge he also gave me and he promised me on the word of a Christian thathe would redeem this pledge.  For some time he sent home monies, which I can vouch myself were faithfully expended in purchasing food &c for the family.  About the fallof last year these remittances gradually fell away likewise letters.  The wife finding herself in this position had to seak what scant labor she could, her own trade as an army accoutrement maker having fallen off.  The worry of this and seeing her homegradually having to be sold to meet her rent soon told upon her, and, as I feared, has now so undermined her health, as to utterly prostrate her and incapacitate her from again following (for a long time at least) any employment, consequently the family are now starving.  The last remnant of furniture that would realise any cash was very reluctantly sold to a dealer, viz a piano which fetched only 8 pounds.With care this sum was laid out to pay rent, furing and food for 17 weeks through the late bitter winter.  Mrs Goalen finding she can get no response to her letters and the situation being a painful one has compelled her to ask me to appeal to you on her behalfbelieving that you will as a Christian gentleman try and bring the errant husband to the knowledge of the grave position of those he has so cruelly deserted in this great City.  I now on their behalf ask you Sir to immediately use your best endeavors to compell Brother Goalen to communicate with his family and to do that which he has an undoubted  right to  doI as their advocate shall indeed be pleased to know that your kind efforts have borne good fruit and that I as the humble writer of this epistle have only done my duty.I might add that any plea made by Brother Goalen leaving them a good home is no set off to his silence.  The wages of "Smith's" in your City are well known here and he told his wife that hecould easily earn £ 5 a week. half of which sum he would send her.  The only stray news the wife has gleaned in 6 months was in a letter sent to a relative wherein it wasstated he had gone South.  The facts I have stated are literally true and now

 natives? I tell you, if we send thispeople off from us and treat themwith contempt we shall regret it, and mourn because of it. I am going to tell you what to do with these natives,you Bishops and Presidents of Provo and Springville, call out those teams which you have about you, all of them, and if these Indians want wood, haul it for them for you haveburned theirs, and they need a littlewood as well as you. Let them havefeed on the range for their horses, wood to burn, and then they will letyou alone. You will eat their fish too, on which they depend for a living one part of the year, and every service berry that you canfind in the mountains, and still you grumble to let them have a little with you. You don't wantthe crickets, and therefore theycan have the whole of them, butyou have secured the antelope and everything else that you could makeany kind of use of. Before the whitescame, there was plenty of fish and ante-lope, plenty of game of almost everydescription; but now the whites havekilled off these things, and there is scarcely anything left for the poornatives to live upon. Brethren what are you going to do with them? Kick them out of doors when they come in and let them starve to death? If we do this, we shall mostassuredly regret it. Well, what willyou do brother Brigham? I will tell you what I will do; there isbrother Armstrong here, and he is an agent, and I want him to set off a piece of land for the natives andmake a division line, and have itclearly understood that they are notto intrude upon your ground, nor youupon theirs. In addition to this, makea road from their land, so that when they want to come to the city they can do it without breaking down fences or intruding upon anybody'sland. Then teach them to work, to fence in their land, to plough, to raisewheat and corn, and potatoes, and everything they need; teach them tobe cleanly and industrious, and prevailon them to send their children to school to learn to read and write theEnglish language, and let some of those men that used to talk of teaching the Lamanites, and of con-verting them, let them go down andbuild a nice school-house in their settlement, and there teach them theprinciples of civilization. And insteadof you wasting your hundreds andthousands worth of time, and of grain, and clothing, do as they did in SaltLake City last year; they formed a society for the benefit of these Indians, and put their means togetherand made them clothing of variouskinds, and distributed those articleswhich they were enabled to obtainamong the Lamanites, and do you goand do likewise. Gather up the yarn, and the cotton yarn, and woollen yarn, and make them up intoclothes to make them comfort-able. But they must work for those things; teach them to workfor all they have and don't encouragethe idle, those who refuse to work. In this way you will gradually bringthem in to civilization, and they willbe convinced that you are their friends,and that you intend to do them good,and these things will lead them to give ear to the Gospel and be bap-tized for the remission of their sins.Now are we going to try to make them one, and encourage them to abide here in peace, or are we determined to drive them from us?I can tell you the Lamanites of thesemountains will yet be a shield to thispeople if we do right, and if we will not do our duty, our necks are readyfor the halter or the knife; yes, you will find that our necks will be readyfor the knives of our enemies, if we do not look to these poor degraded natives. 
 G. S. L. City Decem. 9, 1856.Elder E. SnowDear bro.I desire to drop you a few lines as themail East goes out in the morning.The Reformation is going on in Israel withmutch warmth and stedfastness, the Missionaries in this city aretaking an active part in preaching to, and stirring up the people.Prest. J. M. Grant went forward in this Reformationas an angel of God in the midst of his brethren, and with aloud voice proclaimed repentance in the ears of this people &made every exertion possible to get the people to live their religion.his labours were so unceasing that he brought his body down tothe grave. He died on the 1st inst after about two weeksillness of chills & fever, then bilious fever, terminating in lungFever. ^he was buried on the 4th. with military honors.^ He is much lamented in Israel, but now lamentedfor his own sake, for we know it is well with JedediahThe last hand cart Coy. arrived nNov 30 whichrelieved our feelings greatly. Many have suffered much havingfrozen their feet, hands, & limbs. The expense of this yearsemigration to us is immense, besides the suffering & exposing of the lives of our brethren who have gone to therescue of the Companies.The last Coy. are at Bridger; and about 604 horse teams have gone out to bring them in, with about30 or 40 tons of flour.Bro. Franklin & myself are all of the Quorumwho are now in the valley, & the Presidency having put theMissionaries under our control, we feel that the responsibilityupon us at this time requires us to live near the Lordthat his grace may be sufficient for us.Praying that you and the brethren of ourQuorum ^abroad^ may have the power & blessing of God to restabundantly upon you for the salvation & gathering ofIsrael & desiring an interest in your prayers. 
 unless some reparation is not immediately made by Brother Goalen the wife will, by the advice of her friends, adopt a course that will not, I fear, be a pleasant one.  But I have no doubt myselfthat a perfectly amicable arrangement can be madethrough your good offices and you can rest assurred that you will be rewarded by the gratitude of an honest hard working woman and family.Personally I have no feeling in the matter, other than that which prompts the strong to champion the cause of the weak and defenceless. And in conclusion I hope I have not trespassed on your valuable time by the length of my letter .  Mrs. G. will anxiously await your reply.I RemainReverend SirYours very FaithfullyW. A.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. Box, B.Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 26, 1893Dear Brother Atkins:I received your interesting letter of Nov. 16th,but through the multiplicity of business the answer has been delayed.I also got letters from Brother Thompsen upon the same subject of theboiler and pipes, and am pleased that they are doing so well and aresatisfactory. Brother Ottenger made some big mistake in his calculationabout that water system; I hope it will do all right now.We are having some curious times here of late. About thetime our State Bill passed the House with only five opposing votes, theClergymen of Utah met, and when Mr. McNiece made a motion to telegraph toWashington, as clergymen, to oppose our State Government, two-thirds ofthose present voted against him, saying they had had war enough and nowwanted a State Government. At the same time the Liberals met, dug agrave and buried all their Liberal sentiments, and both parties sentstrong telegrams to Washington for State Government. Unless there issome great change, it looks now as though Utah would soon become a State.President Cannon has just returned from New York where hehas been a short time on Church business. We are all well as usual; Ithink I feel better than I did before I was sick. I think your accountof David Milne is quite enough. Remember me to your family and to myfreiends.Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 Saints because they profess to be-lieve in revelation, in Prophets and Apostles. This has been the case ever since the organization of thisChurch. De we teach anything that is contrary to the laws of God?We do not. Do we believe any-thing that is contrary to the Gospel as taught in the days of the Apostles? We do not. "But," says one,"how did you come by this Gospel?" We came by it through the ad-ministration of an angel from God.John the Revelator, in speaking of the last day—the opening of the seals—the blowing of the trumpets—and all that should transpire be-fore the second coming of the Sonof Man—said he saw (among otherthings) "another angel fly in themidst of heaven, having the ever-lasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to everynation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory tohim, for the hour of his judgmentis come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] When the angel of God delivered this message to Joseph Smith he told him the heavens werefull of judgments; that the LordAlmighty had set his hand to estab-lish the kingdom that Daniel saw and prophesied about, as recordedin the ##Daniel 2:26-47|second chapter## of Daniel;and that the Gospel had to bepreached to all nations under heaven as a witness to them before the end should come, and that, too, in fulfill-ment of the revelation of God,as given here in the Old and New Testaments. Joseph Smith never attempted to organize this Church until he received commandment soto do from God. He never attemptedto baptize a man until he received the Aaronic Priesthood under the hands of John the Baptist (whowas beheaded for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus). [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8##] Henever attempted to officiate in any of the ordinances of the Gospeluntil he received the Apostleship under the hands of Peter, Jamesand John. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##] These men appeared to him. They laid their hands uponhis head and sealed the Apostleshipupon him with all the power thereof.And these angels told Joseph Smith to go forth himself and to call upon other men to go forth unto the worldand preach the Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ and the Apostles, and the Lord would back up their testi-mony; that when they laid handsupon those who had been baptizedfor the remission of sins, and who had received their testimony, theyshould receive the Holy Ghost.This was the proclamation to Joseph Smith 53 years ago.Now, I want to ask this assembly, strangers and Latter-day Saintsalike, what position the Elders ofIsrael would have been in when they went forth and made this promise to the inhabitants of theearth—the promise that if theywould receive of our testimony,repent of their sins and be baptized for a remission of them, and havehands laid upon them, they shouldreceive the Holy Ghost—I want to ask, gentlemen and ladies, how longthose Elders would have taught this principle in the nations of theearth if God Almighty had notbacked up their testimony? Howlong would it have been, in theabsence of this backing, until theywould have been found out to be deceivers? Not a great while.Is there another set of men on theface of the earth to-day, that dare to go forth and make that proclama-tion to the world? No; becauseunless they were called of God to make it, He would not back up theirtestimony, and it would be knownwho they were. 
 for while Starvation is knocking at the doors, the head of the family, to drown his sorrows, will spend his hard Earnedpittance in beer cellars ^and^ whiskey rooms, & still more loathsome places are soughtto bury consciousness of the family's sufferings. May the Lord Speed the day when his people will all be gathered homeaway from Such Scenes.The best season for Missionary labors has now Commenced,in view of which an additional force of Elders will be placed in the fieldto distribute tracksts & open the way for Meetings to be held.With abundant aid from the Saints in Utah, we have been able to swell the list of our Emigration from Scandinavia to the number of 650Souls ^this season^ & there are already prospects for a few for next year.
