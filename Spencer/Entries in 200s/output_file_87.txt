 S. G. CLARK,COUNTY AND DISTRICT CLERK,SEVIER COUNTY.RICHFIELD, UTAH, Jan. 25th 1898.Pres. Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother:Enclosed herewith will be found my answer to your letter of the 12thinstant, endorsed by my bishop as requested. The same gives a general statement of my circumstances financially. My wife is somewhat conserned about my goingat the time designated in my call, Apr 2nd [18]98. She believes that the Lord desires me to go on that date or I would not have received the call. She feels willing totake the apparent consequences, to loose her home, which is about all we have, and to be left without any means of support for herself and children, so long as these sacrifices are made in doing the will of the Lord. My feelings would besimilar to those of my wife were it not for the fact that your letter contains the words, "Should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going."The Lord in His goodness has given me a good wife and five sweet children, oneof which He has recalled, and alone and unaided except by Him I have provided them a home and the average necessities and comforts of life. I lovemy family next to my God and I do not feel that I will be justified inleaving them on the date designated unless you find, after considering mycircumstances, that it is the Lord's will, and then I will do so cheerfully, nomatter what may be the consequences, knowing that I am doing His will.Should you decide that it is the Lords will that I respond to the call on the date named, I will do all in my power to comply, but should you, on the other hand, decide that the Lord requires me to place my affairs in order, 
 Richfield, Sevier County, Utah, Jan.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah,Dear Brother:In responce to your favor of the 12th instant, advising me that my name had been suggested and accepted as a missionary to Scandinavisa, permit me to make the following statement of my privateaffairs:My indebtedness on my home is $400 the mortage being held by the Western Loan & Savings Co. of your city, in which company I hold sevenshares of stock the monthly payment on which amounts to $8.40.I hold certificate of purchase from the State on 40 acres of un-cultivated University Land on which the annual payment is $19.68.The County Commissioners have just licensed me to conduct an Abstra^ct^business in Sevier county and I have purchased records of the value of$50 which sum must be paid during the present year. I have also purchas-ed a small tract of land opposite the court house on which to erect a building for the purpose of this business. This land cost me $120 of whwhich amount I have paid $50 and $50 of the remaining $70 is to bepaid in Nov. of the present year, and the balance, $20, in March 1899,otherwise I forfeit the amount now paid.I owe the Jas. M. Peterson Bank of this city, $25; the Manti City Savings Bank, Manti City, $110, and the Utah Cmo'1 & Savings Bank, Salt Lake City, $37.50.I own no real estate or other property that is at present bringing me revenue, or likely to in the near future, or that I could at present sell except at a great loss.My only means of support for myself and family is derived from mydaily labor.I am at present under contract with Sevier county to complete cer-tain abstract records for which labor I will receive, when completed,$175.At the last session of the County Commissioners I was appointedDeputy County Clerk for the year 1898 at a salary of $250.I have about $200 worth of our county warrants which I think willbe paid about the latter part of this year or first of next.My family consists of my wife and four children, the age of the olde^st^being eight years. I have no relatives that are in a position to aidthem in my absence therefore whatever provision is made for their sup-port must be made by me before leaving.My aged Father living in Idaho, is very week and feeble and has noone but me to look to for financial aid when the condition of his healthis such that he cannot provide for himself and wife. He has no means ofsupport excepting his own labor.

 The foregoing is a brief outline of the condition of my affairs.I leave it with you to advise me as to what you think would be properfor me to do considering all the circumstances. I desire to do the willof the Lord, whatever it may be, to provide for my family, and to pre-serve my business integrety.Your Brother in the Gospel,J. M. LauritzenP.

This knowledge would be a comfort to my wife as well as to me.We would not then feel that we were disobeying His commands, but that we were entitled to, and could claim His blessings in the same degree asif this call had not been issued. If an extention of time is granted meI would like to have a definite date fixed when I am to leave so thatI may have something to work to, and during the time that I remainat home it shall be my aim to improve and fit and prepare myselffor this labor in the cause of truth.Repectfully your brother in the Gospel.J.

Since that time I havebeen very economical in money mat-ters but with all my economy, havebeen able to save but very little.I have been trying to get ready togo this year. Some people haveadvised me to go, telling me thatI think if his couragefail not, it would bewell for him to go onhis mission about themiddle of July, or as soonthere after as he can, notgoing wholly by sight, but trusting a little in the Lord."God and a good man makea large majority," sometimes.J.

 I would come out all right if Ihave but little to start with. Othershave advised me to remain at homeuntil I have something to startwith, telling me that it would onlybe a burden on the church tokeep me. I therefore am almostpuzzled to know what to do, as Ihave never been outside of CacheValley, and know nothing of theexpense of travelling. I willtherefore submit this matter to you for your decision.I have a wife and one child. I haveno home but have been compelledto rent during the 18 months wehave been married. We had nothingto start us in life and were forcedto contract several debts. I have hademployment but part of the timeand it has therefore taken about all I have earned to pay mydebts and keep us going. I have no property and no one to dependon for help. I have paid all mydebts and by the middle of JuneI think I shall have about $75 tostart me. As for my wife, I think she will be all right while I amgone as she has a number ofrelatives.Will you please be kind enoughto advise me what to do & I willgladly accept your decision.Should you advise me to goI shall try and be ready by the middle of July. Should youdecide for me not to go at presentI shall continue to save what I can, and will do what I canto prepare myself to fulfila mission. Hoping to hear fromyou at an early date, I remain.

Since thenI've read the book of Mormon, the Doctine and Covenants, Orson Pratts works, and several other volumes: And I found that the truths con-tained in these books, were at one with thelaws of nature and with natures God.The Lord had made me familiar with HisTruth; but I was still ignorant concerning hisOrdinancesâ€”these I have since subjectedmyself to; and I am informed of the Lord,that they are the [cause] to fit me for my mission.
