July 4  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother,  The enclosed from  Presiding Authorities from Lima Branch Montana we send you for perusal and call your attention to their request  for $250 half cost of a house they speak of as being suitable to meet in.  We do not know anything about the  suitability of the house but apparently  from Brother Hopkins letter you may have  heard more fully from Elders Stevenson and Cawley: I will say that the branch was organized Devember 20 last and no yet very little tithing has come to us.  We will be pleased to hear your mind on the subject when convenient  Your Brother in the Gospel T E. Ricks ENDENTRY W. Woodruff June 30 1880  Salt Lake City, June 19, 1880. President Sunset.  Dear Brother—I received your letter of June 7, and was glad to hear from you, but sorry to learn that you had let that colt kick you in the face. That is a trick that I thought you never allowed your horses to do, but I suppose he being a colt had not learn- ed the lesson. I hope it will not be a lasting injury to you. I am glad to learn that you had a good conference. I should certainly have been glad to have been with you. You speak of the spring crops, etc. It seems to me that winter has just broken here. We are now having hot weather. It has been so cold that corn could not grow. It stands just on top of the ground, but it is now begin- ENDENTRY ning to grow.  All crops are back- ward, but we have plenty of water. I am glad to hear your stock is doing well, and to learn of a good start on the tannery, and that it is doing well. I wanted to know how that bark mill did. I think you had a good offer for the fifty heifers, $20 each, but perhaps they will do you as much  good as the money. Has your mare Mary got a horse colt? Give my love to my Indian friends when they ask about me. J. W. Y. said he had baptized Comiaga's son (I want to say right here that I spoke at Provo on my Indian visit, and the reporter published it in the Territorial En- quirer without my seeing it, and it was a very incorrect report, represen- ting me as saying many things which I did not say. It was a bad, jumbled mess. I name it ENDENTRY here in case you should read it, for I do not claim it as my report at all.)  I am in hopes someday of seeing Sunset and other settlements in Arizona again. Will you please inform me in your next letter what those tithing orders are that Jesse N. Smith has given on you, for we do not know any thing about them here in the Salt Lake office. I want to advise you and all the settlements in Arizona to make an annual report of all tithing to the general tithing office here, as other stakes do, for it will remove all chance of prejudice against those who are living in the United Order. But we do not know where those tithing orders are from, nor who has given them, that you speak of. ENDENTRY I named what you wrote concerning answering any calls that President Taylor might make on you, but he prefers altogether for you to make up your regular tithing account annually, and let that be sub- ject to his order and no more. I was glad to learn that Foutz and Walker and J. W. Y. were getting settled all right. Remember me kindly to Brother Neilson, and say to him that I got his ferry stock account all right, which will enable me to give credit to whom due. It is a general time of health with us, with few exceptions. Elder O. Pratt's health is still quite delicate. We expect: Geo. Q.  Cannon with us on Tuesday. I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to all in the fort. Please deli- ver the inclosed to whom directed, and oblige your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Nov. 10", 1882. Dear Brother Lot.  Your letter dated  Dec 1" (you meant Nov. 1") arrived all  safe and I was very glad to get it. I had not time to say all I thou- ght about the matter when I wrote; I did not say that I believed the  reports that were written to Prest. Taylor,  for I consider that I am somewhat  acquainted with you and I have  been satisfied a good while that many  things have been said about Br. Lot  Smith that are not true.  I was  somewhat surprised at what you  said about the Pitkins for they sent  a letter to Prest. Taylor - I do not know  that it was signed by the young man  ENDENTRY sideways text April 12 1881 W. Woodruff end of sideways text  Salt Lake City, page torn April 12 1880.  Pres. Lot Smith,  Dear Brother,  I received your first letter after you  returned home. I was truly glad to hear from you, and that Jim. had got well. I have been so overwhelmed since I got home, with  Conference meetings, councils, company day and night that I have hardly  had time to look a wife in the face. I have had no time to write  and have not now, only a few moments. I was appointed at the  Conference the Supt of the Young Men's M. I. Assns for the Moses  Thatcher and Ogden on Saturday  to attend the Stake Conference of the Young Men. I forwarded the Tithing Receipts for the money I brought from L. Hatch  as they could not change it. I sent them back to you. I hope you got them. Half of Farmington and part of  wife from  Farmington called upon me and wanted to know how  you get along. I told them well. The apostles seemed  to appreciate washat assistance you are rendering  to the needy who want bread. I wish also to say  in this connection that the Joseph H. Wil- kins of St John, she lives in Ogden. He is one of the car- penters we took dinner with at St John. His mother has heard that he had nothing to eat but black beans. She wanted to know  if she could not deposit 25 or 30 bus. of wheat in the Tithg Office  ENDENTRY but by the father stating as I said that  he brought in a new wagon, worth  (I think) $140 and got one of no use  except for old iron etc. and that you held  an iron rod over his head and made  him sign a receipt, fully by force, before  you would let him go.  I did not think a man would put such a tale as  that in writing without something to make  it out of.  I do not wish you to send  any statement of all your operations to  Prest. Taylor since you have been in the  order, not on my account for I do not  think he would have time to read them  for I think he has now more than he  wants to attend to; but it is well for you to  keep all evidence in your hands to  meet any accusations that may ever be  brought against you. ENDENTRY I am much pleased with your nar- rative of the Echo Canyon war, in the  Contributor.  It is very interesting  This is about all I want to say  at this time.  Give my love to your  wives and children and all the men. women, and children in Sunset.  You brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff   ENDENTRY and let him page torn in Hunter about it, and he said he would do it. But I did not know  where he could get the wheat in Arizona, except it was of you. So I told her to deopposit some wheat in the office and I would  send the order to you and I hope you will do what you can  about it. I think you took a bucket of flour to him, when we  went there. We had a good conference, a large assembly, and the  Spirit of the Lord with us. I want you to give my love and blessings  to all the inhabitants of Sunset not leaving out the sisters and chil- dren. I have not time now to write upon any thing much only  on business and hardly that. I found my family all well and glad to  see me, as I was them. Please say to Bro Pitkin, I recd his letter and  will write him when I can get time. Give my love to Bro Lake St Joseph and all my friends who enquire. I judged  from what I learned from your letter that you was not going  to have much trouble on the timber question, which I am thank- ful for, I shall always be glad to hear from you.  Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff  ENDENTRY Private. I wish to say that the subject came up of our permitting the  young people to be married by the Authorities of the Church in Arizona, without  going to the Temple. And the Council all sustained it where they were so  far from the Temple. And the remark was made, that it would seem neces- sary to establish a place for Endowments at some future time in  Arizona so that young people could get legally married, without  going so far. I got a telegram from Albu- querque—was buying goods. I hope Bro Tenney will not  mix any Mdse with the St John Purchase. And the Council  wish all Co-op stores to be governed by the Presidency of the Stake.

Dear Brother—Your letter of Nov.  24th arrived all safe, but I have  not had time to answer it before. I was pleased to hear that you had a pros- perous journey to the west and back. I would have liked to have been with you  at St. George, but could not be. I have  thought perhaps that I might visit St. George  some time during the winter, to attend  to some Church business.  It is a  general time of health with us, with  few exceptions.  C. C. Rich is gaining  some.  O. Pratt's health is quite poor- ly .  My health is quite good. I got on the scales the other day. I  weighed 166 lbs., about 4 lbs. more  than I ever weighed before.  My  first wife a week ago had twenty five  ENDENTRY teeth drawn at one time, under the in- fluence of ether, which made her sick for 24  hours, and she has had a sore mouth ever  since.  We had the coldest November  I ever saw.  It is more mild this  month.  Geo. Q. Cannon is in  Washington.  I have not heard from  him since he left.  I was sorry to  hear of the bad luck of Brigham City Saints with their crops.  Are they all  leaving?  Where does Brother Lake go? How much wheat did you have, and how  much corn?  Bishop St. John has been with us to get help to pay  for that place. He supposed, from  Brother Tenney's representation, that the  purchase was made for the Church, that is, that the Trustee was made  responsible for the payment. This  was a wrong idea entirely. It  was bought for the Latterday Saints  to go there, take possession of the land, ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, April, 15, 84. Lot Smith. Dear Brother:-  Enclosed you  will find a sheet containing the  apportionment of the various Stakes  in St. Johns. We held a meeting in the Social  Hall last night and called 30  families from this stake; if 20 of  them go I will be satisfied.  I  sent out a copy last night to all  the presidents of Stakes in the Ter- ritory hoping that they will act  promptly.  I received two letters from A. M. Tenney who says it is quiet  at present but the enemies are hold- ing secret meetings and planning  mischief.  I am sending a copy of the  apportionment to Bp. Jesse  N. Smith to be forwarded by  ENDENTRY and pay for it, but it has got in such  a fix that the trustee had has had to  stretch out his hand to assist to save  the place.  He gave an order on the Southern herds for some 275 cows. Brother Udall conveyed an idea that  you told him that you had 100 cows  held in reserve to help to pay for  that place.  Brother Udall said  he had not received them, and the  question arises, Where are they? I did  not know whether there was any mis- understanding about it. We want  him to have any Church tithing of any  kind in Arizona, that he can make use  of, until that place is secured and  paid for.  Again, Brother Taylor  has put it upon me to have all the  emigration of the Saints that go to  Arizona, to go to St. John, until there is  enough there to take the land and water  and use it.  Brother Udall said ENDENTRY private conveyance, so that he  may know what we are doing.  Prest. Cannon, and  several others start for the Iron  works on Wednesday and the  Presidency go on to St. George for  a short visit.  My kind love to all,  Your Brother in the gospel,  W. Woodruff  ENDENTRY that he met nearly 100 wagons going  to Arizona, but he knew nothing about  them, nor where they were going to, and  thought many of them were going on  their own hook, perhaps to get off by  themselves.  But as most of the emi- gration will go by Sunset, I want to dele- gate you to say to them that the counsel of  the Presidency and Twelve Apostles to them  is to go direct to St. John and settle there  under the direction of Bishop Udall  until he says it is enough.  There  should be nearly 200 families settle there.  There should be men enough to  make use of all the water during  emigration time, or we shall constantly  have outsiders squatting down and  claiming waste water.  We wish  you to say to all emigration of the Saints who wish to claim fellowship with us, that we want them to take our counsel  in this matter and go to St. John, ENDENTRY instead of going everywhere else, until that place is settled, and if they will  not do this they cannot have our fel- lowship.  When St. John is settled, after it is done satisfactorily, they can  make changes if they wish.  We look  upon the St. John country as being as  good as any part of Arizona, and unless  the Saints possess and control St. John,  there is no Mormon settlement will have  any peace in that territory.  It seems  rather strange to us, the manner in  which the last election was controlled. Brother Tenney's representation to me was  that the Barth's asked for none of the offices  whatever, only for our people to vote for  the county seat to remain at St. John.  But, instead of this, in the election the  Mormons lost every office in the county. When I think that they hold the legal ENDENTRY majority of votes in the county, I think  our people will find hard work to live  under the control of that class of men  who have held control of Apache County. It seems as though there was a screw  loose somewhere in that election. But I feel that we should never rest  until we have full control of St. John  and root out that nest that dwells there.  If there is any tithing stock, grain or money in any part of  Udall can  use for the payment of this debt,  we wish him to have it.  My  love to your family and all the  Saints in Sunset, not forgetting  the children.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W.

I have had three short notes from them, but they gave me no account of their travels. Br. Grant spoke of attending the funeral of your little son.  I feel interested in the labor of the brethren among the Lamanites of all that country. The Oribas and Moquies are very dull and super- stitious and hard of understanding compared with the Navajoes, Zoonies, Lagooneies, and Islatos.

Dear Brother,  We presume that the statement of the number of families apportioned to be selected from your Stake to strengthen the settlement at St. John, Ari- zona, has been received by you and acted upon.  We desire these brethren to proceed upon their journey as soon as they can possibly make it convenient to do so.  Some of those who are called may prefer to go by railroad, which is much more expeditious and expensive. We cannot say positively what the  fare will be by rail, but perhaps not less than forty dollars for adults, chil- dren under ten years, half price. But all this business can be satisfactorily  arranged in this city.  We deem it more prudent, in the majority of cases, for the brethren to go across country with teams. True, by team it is a long and tedious journey, but healthful and comparatively inexpensive. Then, when the brethren arrive at their destination, they have their teams, wagons, harness and many useful implements to begin to build up homes with and make their families comfortable.  The proper route for teams will be up the Sevier river, over the divide via Lee's) Ferry, on the Big Colorado river, thence to Little Colorado river, up said river via Greer's Ranch, to St. John.  Those who desire to go by railroad will travel by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad to Pueblo, thence by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to Albuquerque, thence by the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad to Navajo Station, which lies about forty miles north of St. John. Complete arrangements can be made for transportation by railroad, from this city to Navajo Station, thence by teams to St. John, by communicating with W. C. Spence, at President John Taylor's office, in this city.  W. Woodruff  Chairman. ENDENTRY W. Woodruff  had any little difficulty, they would come to me with their troubles.

Dear Brother—I have a good many things I want to say to you with my pen, but up to the present hour I have found but very little time. We have been in either coun- cils, conferences, or meetings, of some kind, ever since I came home. I wrote to you on the 12th and sent the ti- thing receipts and a letter to J. W. Y. Since then I have received a letter from J. W. Y., saying they were buying goods at Christofferson, and others. He also spoke about taking a contract on the railroad for our people.

ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Mar. 23rd, 83.  Sister Lot Smith:  I have just  received your letter containing the  painful news of the loss of your  little son Wilford. I feel to deeply  sympathize with you in your  loss and by such a death. My  oldest son, Wilford is 43 years to- day. When a child he drank lye which came very nearly killing  him. His throat grew up so that  he came verynear choking to death  for years afterwards and has  not got entirely over it yet. I  have sometimes thought the name  itself was rather unfortunate; still  I do not think that a name ENDENTRY I also got a letter, directed to Brother Taylor and W. Woodruff, saying that Brother Tenney had sent an agent to borrow a hundred cows, to Brother Flake, to make a payment this spring on the St. John purchase. Brother Hatch wanted the council to furnish Brother Murdock or bearer $1,000 for Brother Flake, and for Brother Flake to furnish that amount of barley to Brother Hatch for the people to sow and make bread of. But the coun- cil did not wish to do it. The coun- cil has decided that the presidents of stakes and bishops furnish Brother A. M. Tenney, as a loan, what tithing stock they may have on hand to help pay the 100 cows this spring, and we want to continue to pay for that purchase until it is settled for, but we want the people who go there to pay the debt, and not the church. ENDENTRY has anything to do with good  or bad fortune. Truly the loss of  children in that way is painful but there is one consolation in the  matter—you will have him again  in the morning of the first resur- rection in your family organization,  of the same age and size that  you laid him away. I hope you may be comforted in your  affliction. I would like to see  you and your wives and children  once more. Give my kind love  to them all.  I expect that little Lorenzo who  used to help me about my break- fast is getting to be quite a  boy. I should like to see all  the children of the Sunset fort once more.  I understand that you went  with Brothers Grant ENDENTRY But we think it is necessary to help about it, so that we shall not lose the purchase. I thought there had people enough gone there to raise the 100 cows this spring. But we think the church and the branches in Arizona will be under the ne- cessity of helping about it, as a loan, until the place is secure. I have not had word from Brother St. John on the mission.  I found my family all well on my arrival, and we were again glad to meet. We are having good times in our Conference meetings and councils. We are united in our councils and the spirit of the Lord is with us. There was a good deal of inquiry about Farmington people and others. I hope to hear from you and know how all is ENDENTRY to the Seven Villages. I wish  when you get time you would  give me a little sketch of your  visit among them—how much time you spent with them, holding  meetings, with what success andc andc. How did as fat a man as  Brigham get up and down among them? I should be glad to hear  any information concerning their  visit with you. What are the pros- pects among the Lamanites and  what is A. M. Tenny ^doing^? What is  the prosperity in your settlement? Any thing of that kind would be  of interest to me. Give my kind  love to the people of the fort.  Write when you can.

I also forward in this the order for 30 bushels of wheat for Brother J. W. Watkins at St. John. The brethren thought that as he was a missionary they would let him have as much wheat there as his mother put in here. I did not know but you would be close run on the wheat question, but whatever you can do in that line will be a blessing to him. It is still very cold here. On the 17th we had nearly a foot of snow.

Woodruff Salt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1882. Elder Lot Smith. Dear Brother - I have felt a desire to write to you for some time past. President Taylor is receiving letters from persons who leave your fort and go to other places to settle. They complain bitterly of your treatment of them in the settlement of their accounts. Among others, the Pitkins said that their property was priced very low when taken in, and very high when taken out. They said they gave in a wagon worth $125, which was priced at $50, and got a wagon in return good for nothing but old iron, and he was forced to sign a bill of receipt with an iron rod over his head, or something of that kind. Now of course these  stories are all on one side of the question But they have their effect against you, and I would like not to have any more such stories come to the First Pres- idency, if possible to avoid it. ENDENTRY that this instruction be given to all the branches in your stake.  Brother Taylor says they get no report of the tithing in Arizona, but I told him what had been paid on the ferry and the tithing money I brought. Please impart this instruction to Brothers Lake, Richards, etc. ENDENTRY 2 Now I think that a man who has done as much for Israel as you have in your day, can afford to be generous with those who leave your settlement, and let  them have as good as they bring to you, inasmuch as they get no in- crease. There is hardly any man speaks well of you, who leaves your settlement. They generally go away dissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatch was called by the authorities to go to Savoy, to assist Brother Titien. I have Never heard of his saying anything upon the subject. The quorum of the Twelve have been districting Utah and the other territories on the Indian Mission question, but it has been referred to the Presidency, and is now in their hands. We appointed you to stand at the head of the mission in Sunset Stake, and Snowlake Stake, ENDENTRY 3 and if this thing is confirmed by the Presidency, there may be some of the Twelve to visit all New Mexico, etc., to assist in this organ- ization, as we shall want to gather all the missionary strength we can in all those stakes. There is a  great desire to make the Lamanite mission as effectual as possible throughout all the territories. President Taylor has received a revelation, in which George Teasdale and Heber J. Grant were appointed to fill the vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Seymour B. Young and Abram H. Cannon were appointed to fill the vacancies in the quorum of the First Presidency of the Seventies, all four of whom have been ordained. We had a good Conference, strong preaching and strong testimony. John T. Caine is ENDENTRY 4 the People's candidate for Congress, and Van Zile the ring candidate. Now, Brother Lot, I want you to write  me a letter and tell me how many families you have got left with you. How your crops are this season. How is the Indian question? What is the prospect of labor among the Navajoes, Moquis, etc.? How is your health, and how is your fami- ly? Give my love to them all. C.C. Rich was with us at Conference a part of one meeting.

I received  your letter of Feb. 18th and  I was glad to hear from  you as I always am.  I was sorry to have that interesting letter get drown- d and the money too,  but it was better for that to be lost than for the man, at least if he  was worth more than a  hundred dollars and he ought to be.  I would be glad to visit you again and to visit your settlements, but I do not know when  it will be. I would like to visit your new settle- ENDENTRY ments at least the one in the mountains. I would like to know what you are doing with Sunset are you occupying the place now; is it your post office? I see that you date your letter there. The Moquis are an innocent people but I think quite superstitious in some things.  There seems to be quite an opening among the  Pimas the  leading men are receiv- ing the work and I think the tribes will follow. They had quite a difficulty of late with Crismon and his boys. I think his  boys are hard cases. they  take up Indian stock  put them in the pen and charge $1 a head and  the Indians put some of Crismon's cattle in the pen and charge 50¢ each ENDENTRY and the Crismon boys  undertook to take them by force and threatened their lives and there would have been a fight and the Cris- mon family wiped out if  it had not been for Hinck- ley, Hawks, our  missionaries who stopped the Crismon boys coming out on the ground to  fight; that family has made a good deal of trouble with Lamanites and Mormons. Br. Young is  visiting in California; I expect him home soon.  Br. Thatcher has retur- ned from Washington and Br. Cannon is on his way home which leaves Br. Caine alone. I do not know what Cong- ress will do but they are getting wicked enough  to do anything.  It is a general time ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Jan. 27, 1881.  Lot Smith,  Dear Brother; I recieved  your letter of Dec. 28, 1880. I have  not been able to answer it before. I am very sorry for your accident  and hope you will recover from it,  and that you may not be permen^an^tly  lame. I do not hear a word from  B. Young; in fact, do  not know where they are or what they  are doing, but suppose they are some- where in Arizona.  We learned that Bishop Udell  has crossed the Lees Ferry with all  his stock, all well. I hope he will  have good luck in getting them to  St. John in safety.  I see the editors of the "Dem- ocrat" seems to have a key to get  knowledge. I know nothing of the  ENDENTRY of health with us. I am  somewhat troubled with a cold at present which is  a common complaint in this country at present.  Br. Fowler who was labor- ing in the Tithing Office, died rather suddenly; we bury him tomorrow. We  are having pleasant weather overhead but our streets are very muddy.  Our Legislators are grin- ding away the best they can, but I do not know  what they will accomplish.  I spent the most of De- cember in St. George Tem- ple and had a good  time and a good con- ference. I wish you would tell me by letter how many you have with you and  ENDENTRY elections only from Brother Tenny.  I am glad you are so fruitful. I hope your posterity will honor both  God and their parents.  I think the Navajoes were suc- cessful on their hunt.  I hope Mary's boys will prosper  as well as the rest.  Remember me kindly to all your  family and all in the Fort.  We got a letter from George Q. Cannon. He feels well and is boyant in spirit. Says God reigns, and is thoroughly con- vinced that Gov. Murry has hurt him- self and his party much more than  George Q and the Saints.  The Apostles are all well ex- cept C. C. Rich. The lat- ter is gaining very slowly, and O. Pratt is quite poorly: mostly confined to  his bed and room—is quite weak. But  we hope for the best. ENDENTRY what your prospect is for  farming in your new settle- ment. Are you going to abandon Sunset; if so will you move your buildings  to your new settlement? What will be done with the place what is done with the mill; are there any inhabitants in Brigham City? What is Br. Lake doing and where is  he?  Remember me kindly to  your Wwives children and  friends, and write when you can.

We had a very cold November, but  quite open December and January.  Will you please read the enclosed  to the emegration who passes through  Arizona and oblige?  We have eight members of the  Joseph Rich the  most conspicuous.  Have the Saints entirely abandoned  Brigham City? What are they going to do with the place? Has Brother  Tenny left Sunset? Where has he gone? How is the timber question  with you? Is it settled all right  with the officials?  As ever, Your Brother in the gospel,  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Nov.28, 1882.  President Lot Smith.  Dear Brother - I received your letter of Nov. 15, and in reading it I would judge that you had not received the letter I wrote you Nov. 10. You did not say that you had received it. I stated plainly in that letter in a private note that I did not believe the reports given about you. It is true, you cannot hin- der people talking, any more than I can and I do not care what people say against one, if they do not tell the truth. I could tell my enemies a great many failings I have that they do not know anything about, but I do not feel disposed to tell them. They may lie about me as much as they please, and I suppose they will do the same by you. I probably did not explain myself clearly when I said that I did not want anymore of the stories to come to Brother Taylor. I have always held uup to all men what you had done for years in the support of the Saints ENDENTRY General Tithing Store,  Salt Lake City, Utah, April 3 1880  Prest.

I would have been glad to have visited you once more in Sunset and the Saints in Ari- zona. Geo. Q. Cannon started this morning for John T.

I would like to know how the election stands with our people in Apache County. Who is elected? Myself and family are as well as usual. L. John Nuttall is able to be about his house, not to come to the office. Judge Elias  Smith is barely able to sit in a rocking chair, he is still very feeble.

Lot Smith.  Dear Brother:  Your letter of  Nov. 28th, is before me, and I feel to say  a little more upon the subject before  us. I wrote to you on Nov. 28th which  of course you had not received when you wrote last.  I will here explain what I meant  in speaking of Prest. Taylors' not having  time to read such accounts as you  spoke of. Of course he could ^read^ a letter,  but if you sent a history of every man  that has been with you in that order, what he brought in, and what he  took out, it would be a document  as large as the New Testament, and  ENDENTRY unless you were on trial for these  things it would not be necessary.  I received a very interesting letter  yesterday from Br. Christian Lingo Chris- tensen upon the Indian question. The  administration to that lame Indian was  very interesting. The time has come  when we are commanded to turn  unto them and it is beginning to be  a day of God's power among them, and  it is our duty now to go among them. I have felt to volunteer to go among  them in Arizona and labor with them;  but Br. Taylor rather claimed the right  to distribute us. So he sends B. Young  and New Mexico. They will start about Jan. 6th, 1883 and  visit you and will look to you and  Jesse N. to assist in their labors among  them. M. Thatcher are now  in F. M. Lyman goes  ENDENTRY through the G. Teasdale  to the L. Snow  and F. D. Richards attend to the northern  tribes. I shall give my views to Br. you and  the brethren in that territory.  Concerning Br. Charles W. Stayner, he  has been getting a code of revelations  as big as the New Testament, and  he, himself was to be the great coming  man. Arthur Stayner at first said  it was all from the devil; if he had  stuck to it, it would have been well,  but he finally fell in with and believed  them. Chas. W. has been brought before  a High Council and finally confessed  they were not of God, asked forgiveness and has been forgiven; now, if he gives  them up, all will be well with him.  Prest. Taylor requires me to tarry  in this country and not go into the  ENDENTRY W. Woodruff  Indian field. He thinks I am most  too old and then I have the Historian's  Office on my hands and a great deal of correspondence concerning the temples and other matters, and he wants me  to attend the conferences in this country. Br. Taylor and myself with those of the  Twelve who are here are now travelling  two-thirds of the time. We have just been through Utah  counties. We start in the morning for  the north.  Manti Temple is ready to turn the arches over the upper story windows, and Logan Temple will be ready for dedi- cation by next Sept.— it might be by  April if they had means enough. We are in hopes that the Salt Lake Tem- ENDENTRY ple will be up to the square next  fall.  From what I learn I suppose a  part of the county offices in the late  election fell into the Mormons.  I and my family are as well as  usual; the Presidency and Twelve are  also well. L. John Nuttall is around  his house again. Elias Smith is still very bad, being confined to his bed, and  in great pain most of the time. In  his fall, he feel upon his lame side  and paralyzed his right leg; and it  looks as though it would be months  before he can walk again if he can  at all. Capt. Hooper came near dying  of late. Br. Van Cott is very low with  brights disease. Br. Peck is able to be  ENDENTRY out again.  Prest. Arthur thinks there has been en- ough legislation at present for the Mor- mons. But Gov. Murry thinks differently,  and Murry may attempt to appoint  another Prest.—Van Zile for instance.  Remember me to all with you, es- pecially your wives and children.  Your Brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Utah. Nov. 8th, 1883.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother.  Your very kind  letter of Nov. 1st arrived all safe and I read a portion of it  in Council yesterday (I left  out that portion concerning my  interest in humanity as my  company might have differed  from you in that sentiment—I  would not read it to them). All  were much pleased with your  account of the Indians. Br. Teas- dale has returned from the  Cherokee Nation; he has labored  hard for six months and not  ENDENTRY baptized a soul. Brs. Daulton  and felt are still there but find  it an up-hill business. I would  rather go among the wild Indi- ans to convert them to the gospel than among those who are so  much Christianized and priest rid- den.  I was glad you agreed with  me about your family here.  I  understand they were calculating  to go back, I have not seen  them since.  I suppose that Brs. Young  and Grant are some where in  your country—you will probobly  see them.  We buried Brs. Lewis Robison  and Israel Barlow; we have  buried a good many aged  people during the present year.  We attended Logan Conference  ENDENTRY on Saturday and Sunday. We went all through the Temple and  expect to see it ready for dedi- cation by March. The roof of  the Manti Temple will soon be  finished. Salt Lake Temple is up  to the square—there will be a  few more rocks laid before it  is put aside for the winter.  Brs. Cannon, Richard, and  Washington looking  after the business of Zion.

Wilford Woodruff. and Brethren,  I hope you will pardon us for being a little slow, in  complying with your circular June the 1st, but after receiving it we commenced to feel around, and I asure you it was a difficult task to find persons having the qualifications named in your conditions, and has got the money to pay for their board and expenses, and the only unsual disapoint- ments in the stock buyers, in delaying their payments, and making them good to our brethren and since then the bottom of our money matters have fell rights ENDENTRY through. No one seems to have a cent of money, and the y storees are crowding every one who owe them a dollar: I suppose these are the conidtions of the people all over the nation, but we havn't been quite asleep.  We have selected two young men and they were in Provo at the coommencement of this term. Fransis Sprowul, from  Washington and son of the Bishop and grandson of our old brother Sprowul the singer, and George Miles of St George, A smart  bright young man, half brother to the celebrated bro. Miles. also a university student. ENDENTRY We have in our city Mrs Mary Lund Judd, second wife of Bishop Thomas Judd, who took five weeks term in August. Being quite freehanded and an experienced hand we thought her quite suitable, providing you would call her, without going again to Provo. This would give  this Stake three, which would be quite a quorm to start with Brother Sprowuls boy made arrange- ments to pay his board in produce from Dixie. This made us late in sending you the names, but we wished to have every certain. The Residency is agreeable in  this matter. I remain your Bro.  Supt. St. Geo. Stake. R.

Dear Brother:  Your favor of Dec. 5th has been received. We regret that any circumstances have arisen to cause you to so write. We believe we appreciate the good that the B. Y. Academy is doing, and would not do nor say anything, nor have others do or say anything, that would lessen its influence for good among the youth of Israel. We are, however, led to think that possibly you received an exaggerated account of what Bro. Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, as we understand you were  not present, and had to depend on what others, who were, possibly, unduly excited, told you. Bro. Joseph F. Smith was present, and did not recog- nize in the remarks made those difficulties that present themselves to your mind and those of your associate teachers, and he thought that when, later in the day, Bro. Grant made an explanation, if not an apology, that he covered the objectionable features of his earlier remarks. We believe that you will act wisely in letting the matter drop, as we do not think the incident was of sufficient importance for you to entertain the indignant feelings that your letter suggests.

Dear Brethren:  Sunday the 4th inst. we held our semi-annual conference here in San Francisco. We had a very delightful time. We had a full house at each of the three meetings. Much interest was manifest. The Elders have gone to their fields of labor with renewed determination all feeling well and enjoying good health. We had three applications for baptism last night. We had a crowded house.  It seems that we are meeting with some success here in San Francisco than elsewhere. We don't feel the opposition of our enemies so much here as we do in the blank places.

I cant say that the release was a surprise as I have felt it for some time and I feel that it was the Lord's will for me to return, though my best energy would have been spent in furthering the  cause had I remained. I hope to always be doing all that is required of  me. I am very thankfurl for the kind expressions your favor contains. I  shall explain everything pertaining to the Mission to Brother Nye before I leave him. I will leave Tuesday for San Francisco where I hope to meet  my successor and establish his in the work of the mission.  I desire to leave every thing in a proper condition. I would not be satisfied to leave with a burden on the Mission for my successor to carry,  so I will send a report of the Mission up to date, and I hoep that satis- factory arrangments can be made for me square up all accounts here before  I leave.

Sept. 29th, 1896  Pres. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother:  Latrobe last Thursday. We held some very successful meetings and were well represented by the press. We have just added six more to the church. There is a gradual increase in all of our congregations, yet we have plenty of indifference to contend with. I received the tracts and Voice of Warning you sent by the Elders.  I have been waiting anxiously for definite word about me staying  in the mission. My wife is not enjoying very good health and being whooly dependent upon others, it is almost more than she can do to care for herself and three litttle ones. If you decide for me to remain here and it be consistent with your feelings I would like  to have my family with me. But that would increase the expense and add unto your burden and it makes me feel that perhaps it would be better for you to send some one who is able to bear the expense. There are Elders who would carry the mission successfully if they could come and stay with me a little while until they become familiar with our methods and I believe it would be well to consider it before you de- cide to keep me. However the matter rests wholly with you. I am willing to do as you say and do my best to further the cause whether here or elsewhere.  Perfect harmony exists among the Elders and we are enjoying our labors, but we have some unpleasant things occasionally among the members. The other power has been working to divide our flocks but so far all little troubles have proven a benefit to us. I have just released Elder B. W. Henderson on account of the financial depression. He is a member of the Henderson and Sons firm at Oneida, Idaho, and is an excellant young man with good judgment. He has been in the  Mission 19 months.  When I sent in my report on the 2nd inst. the mission indebted- ness was $114.18. I borrowed the money of Bro. Scowcroft to carry me along but another month is almost gone and rents are due. I hope you will be able to make an appropriation of $150.00 for the benefit of the mission.  We will hold our northern conference here next Sunday, October 18th we will hold our Southern Conference in Los Angeles. I hope to leave for there about the 12th. Brother and Sister Scowcroft will accompany me south. I expect to be south two and one-half months. I will leave ENDENTRY estimate approximately at 25.00, if I get away in two weeks which I think  sufficient time to stay. My ticket to Frisco will be $10.00 and I would be glad to return by Portland which would add $10.. to the home trip,  making it $29.00 to Salt Lake, whcih will make immergent expenses amount to $150.00. If you will send me that amount I can settle the Mission expense and get home at the end of the expected time. I have borrowed what money I have needed here for the Mission expense which is included in the above amount.  Please write me at your earliest convenience at 612 Van Hess Ave., San Fransisco, and let me know if it meets your approval for me to return via Portland, and if I can do anything for you while here.  I have put the Richards matter in the hands of Elder Millard Scoveroft  who is a thoroughly competent business man and he will report to you the  outlook of the Richards claim and his proposals.  I hope to receive a receipt of the above tithing account and also a  check to balance the mission expenses as soon as convenient.  We held our conference here in Los Angeles the 18th ulcimo, where very encouraging reports were made. Our meetings in the south have not been largely attended though we look for better opportunities now the political confusion has ended for a season.  The elders are well organized in the two conferences under the imediate direction of Presiding Elders of experience so that Elder Nye, if he feels that our plans are good ones, can easily direct the mission and continue the plans already adopted with out trouble.  The Elders will all give Bro Nye their support and I feel that great good will be accomplished. Hoping to hear from you soon, and that are long I will have the pleasure of seeing you. I am very thankful for the support I have received and above all that I can feel in my heart that I have filled my mission in honor. My prayers will continue with the work though I may have to deal with sterner realities.  May God ever bless and prosper you and the people under your ^watch^ care is the prayer of your humble servant.  Your brother (Sgt)  Henry S. Tanner ENDENTRY Elder Henry Peterson in charge here when I am away.  I hope all is well with you and that I may hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Dear Bro: Having returned from a mission  to the Southern States without the  privilege of meeting with or visiting  any of the Apostles I thought I  would write you a few lines that  you might know of the safe arivel of My myself and Elder J. S. Cram of Kanab.  It was my  desire to report to you in person but because of the illness of Elder  Cram I was instructed by Prest S. P. Oldham of the S.C. Conference to see to his safe arival at  Bel- nap station on the Riogrand Western  ENDENTRY his  folks would meet and take care  of him. Before we reached here  we learned, that his folks were  waiting for him at Belwah, and  as he had improved ^in health^ some on the  journey he thought it unnecessairy  for me to go on with him to that  place.  I was set apart for a miss- ion to the Southern States Feb 22nd  1895 and started out on the following  day. On ariving at Chattanooga Tenn. I was appointed to lavor in the S. C. Conference. In company  with Elders Stephenson and  Columbia where  we met Prest Beatie I first labor ed with Elder G. S. Bralley in  Chester Co. then with Elder J. F. Hyatt in York Co.

My next field of labor was York Co which place I continued untill my  release which was June 23. 1897.  Because of false reports the people of  York Co are generally very much oppos- ed to Mormons and Mormonism untill  it was often that we could not get to talk  or hold meetings with the people as we  would have liked. But with all I think  a greate deal of prejudice has and will  continue to be alayed. Twenty or more  persons have been united to the church  since Elder Hyatt and I went to that  Co. and I think there are several  others amongst the first friends that  the Lord raised up to us that will come  into the Church before very very much longer. ENDENTRY We have near Blacksburg (which place was in York Co but is  now cut off and forms a part of Cherokee Co) a Sunday  School with about forty members.  My health was very good the most of  the time.  While traveling I was greately bless- ed and protected of the Lord and  have received many testimonies that the  work is of the Lord. These blessings  and testimonies will be given to every  elder that will do the best he can however  weake he may be.  I believe the S.C. Conference is in a  thriving condition and will no doubt  continue to prosper for I believe the  elders do desire and are trying to carry  out council. Wall Dear President  I feel that I have not lost anything  by going on this mission and if there is  any other labor the Lord desires me  to preform with His blessings I hope to be able to preform it. May the Lord help us to preform every  duty and labor and keep us in the faith  is the preayer of  Your Bro. J. W. Parker.

Woodruff Box B Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother,  For some time past we  have been trying to discover some  good method to adapt in this stake  to bring our people closer together. We  have felt that politics have scattered them  in such a manner as to bring much  injury to many of those who should be  more closely commited with all our  church organizations and in watching our  local newspapers we see them filled from  week to week with nothing but political quarrels. Our people are great readers  of the local papers and we are of the  opinion that if a local paper were started  here under the direction of the Presidency  ENDENTRY of this stake with some of our leading bishops,  have it free from politics and devoted to  the upbuilding of our stake and the organizations of the church, it would do more towards  bringing our people together and creating  a better feeling among the people of the  various wards than any other one thing  we could do just at present. But before  doing anything in the matter we have  felt that it would be our duty to  write you regarding the same and  ask if it would meet with your  approval.

With regard to the matter—the emigration of some of the Maori Saints—that occupies the most prominent place in your communication we will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant to encourage the wemigration of any of this people from their native islands to Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not having been altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn- ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability for such work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have felt that a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and their families might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as you and your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet and overcome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in their mode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains. Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants of the white races are treated—permit them when they reach here to make a way for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for their necessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will be desirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one or more of the brethren who know their language and who have love and ENDENTRY sympathy for them as a people; and further that they be advised to settle in some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitable to them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with the modes of life that will be most advantageous to them. In considering this matter, we have come to the conclusion that Kanab and its neighborhood will be as suitable for settlement by the limited number that you suggest, as any other portion of the inter-mountain region with which we are acquainted.  Such of the intending emigrants as can do so, of those whom you decide are proper persons to come, should accompany you on your return hiome, so that they can have the benefit of your counsel and guidance on the way. Further, we should be pleased to have you continue your supervision over them when they reach their future home, that they still may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance and support that they will undoubtedly need. But of the details of this, and who shall be called to assist you, when such are needed, we can more fully arrange when we meet you.  It is probable that all the missionaries for whom you have asked for Tasmania will not leave by the November boat. The stringency of the times is such that a number of the brethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able to raise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure has had to be postponed. So, we have reason to believe, will be the case with some of those called to labor under your presidency.  We will now say, Brother Stewart, that you are honorably released, with our approval and blessing on your labors, from the Presidency of the Australasian Mission, with the privilege of returning home whenever you consider the best interests of the mission will per- mit. You will please transfer to Elder William Gardner, who has been chosen to succeed you, all the books, papers and property of the mission, ENDENTRY and aid him in assuming his new duties by affording him all the informa- tion with regard to the churches and their members that lies in your  power.  It has been the custom to require half yearly Statistical Reports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions, but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future an Annual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answer the purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incomplete covering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of the calander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of all reliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent and made them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that this change will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if an effort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dutiy it is to attend to these things, to have them as perfect as possible. You will therefore make your next Statistical report include the period from the date of your last report to the end of this year, and annually thereafter.  The brethren chosen for F. W. Ellis (Pocatello). Elder Ellis is a man of fine ability, lengthy experience and a good singer. He is about 40 years of age. Elder Pond is a younger man, also well recommended. He has written for permission to have his wife accompany him, stating that she was a young woman admirably adapted for missionary work. We wrote back that Tasmania would be a hard missionary field for a sister, but if he still desired it, we would not object. At this writing, we have not learned which way he has decided. Two of the other brethren will be instructed to secure tickets for Sidney, and on their arrival you can change the field of labor of any or all of them as you, from your knowledge of the needs of the mission, may deem best. ENDENTRY With love to yourself, your fellow missionaries, and all the Saints,  We remain, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, 8 April 1891  Elder William T. Stewart, Kanab.  Dear Brother:  Your name has been suggested and accepted as a Missionary to Australasia—to preside in that mission.  The work of the Lord is progressing in the nations, and faithful, energetic Elders are needed in the ministry to promulgate the everlasting Gospel, openings for doing good appearing in numerous directions. Yourself, with others, having been selected for this mission, should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going, we would be pleased to have you make your arrangements to start from this City at as early a date as to sail from San Francisco, July 23rd, 1891.  Please let us know, at your earliest convenience, what your feelings are with regard to this call. If you accept it you will receive no further notification, but will be expected to present yourself at the Historian's Office to be set apart on the day previous to that appointed for your departure.

ENDENTRY 528 Jany 5th 8 Pres Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City: Utah  Dear Brother:  Elder James M Cook who  has recently returned from a mission to  England states that on the 5th of June last  he paid sixty four and 90/100 ($ 6 99) Dollars to Pres B. S. Wells at Liverpool with instruction  to make same payable to you at Salt L City  for credit of Brother Cook on his tithing  account in the Rexburg second Ward.  It  appears that Brother Cook sent the draft  for same to his folks here and they claim  it was forwarded to you from here almost  as soon as received by them.  Since then they have not heard anything  further from it.  Would you kindly  let us know if ^it^ has ever been received  by you at your convenience as he is  ready to settle his tithing for 1897.

Preston to us  under date of Mar 1st  "We beg to inform you that in the future we  can not allow the Tithing Department to be charged  with the expense of buggy for Pres. Ricks, as also  the feed and care of horses for him.  These items  must be eliminated from the amount of 1898 unless  permission is given in writing by the First  Presidency"  A word of explanation as to what we have been doing in this particular might not be out of place We have on hand a large two axled buggy that  was furnished for our use a few years ago under  the direction of Bp Preston.  We also have a buggy  harness here belonging to the Tithing Department Bro Ricks has furnished his own team gratuitously, but the expenses of feed, repairs, horshoeing etc have  been charged to the general expense account of our  ENDENTRY Stake office. We estimate that between Fifty and  Fifty Five Dollars on Hay and Grass has been fed the team and about Twentyfive or Thirty Dollars  in repairs sharing etc per annum has been expended in keeping the outfit in a reasonable condition for  service.  Our reasons for so doing are that our  stake is so large that we felt that we could not  do justice to our duties in our official capacity  unless some convenience of this nature was provided.  While we have your attention we beg to state that under existing instructions we feel somewhat delicate  in drawing anything on our customary appropriation until receiving your order to do so. Should it meet  your approval an order for the amount usually  allowed Pres Rigby would be appreciated  Brother Bassett feels in a condition to get along  without any for the present at least.  I shall be pleased to know your minds on both  matters mentioned above whenever convenient for you  to favor us with their consideration.

City Utah  Dear Brother:  We enclose herewith  communication from Elder Don. C. Driggs explaining itself.  If the arrangements are as  he states we have a misunderstanding of the case  Our impressions were that no one of our  missionaries to Montana were to be called for  only three months with the exception of those  who had previously had an experience in the  missionary field.  When Bro Jone Henry Smith was here  at our late Stake Conference Bro Drigg's name  was suggested for a mission to Montana but  on account of his business interests he was  allowed a certain length of time to make the  necessary preparations.  We are not posted as to whether any  other arrangements have been made by Bro John  Henry or yourself, and would be pleased to know ENDENTRY as to whether such is or is not the case so as to  be able to explain your wishes to Bro Driggs and give him the necessary information as to  his Railroad permit, License, setting apart etc upon his arrival here on Monday next  also as to whether his call is for three months  only.  With best wishes we remain  Your Brother  T E Ricks T. E. Bassett  ENDENTRY June 13  1898  President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother,  Our quarterly conference  takes place Sunday and Monday 19 and 20th inst. at Parker as you will see by  attached clipping from newspaper. Whoever of the brethren you are pleased  to send we shall be waiting to  meet at Market Lake Friday or  Saturday morning as you may  notify us.  Your Brother in the Gospel Thos. E. Ricks. ENDENTRY Mar 15th 1898  Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counselors Salt L. City Utah  Dear Brethren:  I am in receipt of a  communication from Elder Geo Reynolds under date  of Mar 14th stating that you would be pleased to  learn from me what were my legal and other reasons  that caused me to look with disfavor on the  effort to remove the County Seat from St Anthony to Rexburg.  My legal reason is in Sec 2 Art 18  of our State Constitution which reads as  follows.  Sec 2 3 county seat shall be removed  unless upon petition of a majority of the  qualified elctors of the county and unless two  thirds of the qualified electors of the county  vote for the proposition at a general election  shall vote in favor of such removal. A word faded petition of removal of the county seat shall not be submitted in the same county  more than once in one year, except as provided ENDENTRY by existing laws.  The election that made St Anthony the  Permanent County seat was held in the fall of  1894. With some, I admit it is held that  the six year provision does not apply to the  first removal of a permanent county seat and  that it only refers to a proposition of removal after a similar attempt has been previously made  Others hold that it would apply with equal  propriety in a first attempt of removal. As to  just how the courts would interpret this is a  question that the future only could decide and  to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly  be made on this technicality in case of our  obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably  entail considerable expenses and of course with our  favorable chances of losing even then.  A careful canvass of the votes by precinct  at our last election indicated very strongly to  me that it was an absolute impossibility to  acquire the necessary votes for its removal at the coming election and that an almost super human  ENDENTRY effort would have to be made to come anywhere  near that number involving an outlay of  thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a  serious division in the good feelings and unity of  our people that would inevitably result from  a contest of this nature.  With the growing sentiments in favor of  Rexburg by reason of our religious and educational  interest and the standing morality of our people and  the waning sentiment in favor of St Anthony  caused by the encouragements to crimes of various ^kinds^ given there and other causes, I felt that our vote  in the future say 2 or 4 years hence would be  stronger and that should ^we^ be successful in then  obtaining the necessary 2/3 vote all legal questions  that now embarras us would be removed without the expense and annoyance of having to  fight them in the courts.  While at Salt Lake City a few weeks ago  text faded see you personally on this matter I left  text faded us not only of 6 of the committee of  text faded but had been selected to investigate and  ENDENTRY determine whether or not a contest should be  made but by others of our leading business  and influential men in the hands of Brother  Geo. F. Gibbs, all of whom sustained me in  the cource I took and to which I beg to refer  you for further information on this subject If however these are not sufficiently explanatory  I shall be pleased to answer any questions you  may desire to ask at any time.  I beg to assure you that my advice on this  matter was only taken after a careful consideration  of all sides of the question having in view the  best good of our people as a whole and with  no desire to harm even the ^an^ hair of the head of any man.  Hoping that at your convenience you  will favor me with your opinion as to whether  my cource in the premecis did or did meet  with your approval I remain  Yours very truly.

Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother,  Our Stake Conference  closed yesterday afternoon after the usual  series of meetings which were all  of the most pleasant character. Our visiting brother Apostle M. F.  Cowley we made grand use of giving  him all the time possible to instruct us, which he did in a very edifying manner, his instructions being highly  appreciated by a large congregation which  met at every session filling our house  to overflowing. Other brethren also  occupied portions of the time and in  all we have had a very enjoyable  conference.

E Ricks ENDENTRY Feb. 21 1898  President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother,  In connection with Bishop E. Z. Carbine we visited Arcadia Branch of Parker ward Sunday 13th inst. The branch has 22 families, a good  lively Sunday school, have built a comfortable meeting ^house^ 20 x 40 ft. which is paid for and on the occasion of our visit we dedicated the house.  It was the general opinion of myself the Bishop and the unanimous feeling  of the people that they should have a  ward organization. The branch is fifteen miles apart from Parker ward proper. The name of the ward was talked of  and decided upon viz: that it should be called Ora that being the name  of the Port Office. At a High Counsel  ENDENTRY meeting held Saturday the 19th the subject was undecided and the name of Marian  Joseph Kew recommended for Bishop of that ward and we now submit the same  for your consideration. With kind regards We are  Your Brethren in the Gospel T E Ricks ENDENTRY June 21 1898  President W.

Palmer, the Stake Presidency, Patriarch  and most of the High Council.  There  was a large attendence of the Presiding  Officers and saints. President Young  spoke to us three times during conference  and gave us much valuable instruction.

City Utah  Dear Brethren:  Your favor of the 22nd  inst to hand in which you ask two further  question relative to the stand I took on the  county seat proposition, the first is:  When I  originally endorsed the movement was I not  acquainted with the arguments I now use, and if  I was, who did I at first countenance the effort.  Replying to this I beg to say that I do not wish  to be understood as originally endorsing the move, but  after considerable agitation by illegible our citizens  I did consent and took part in appointing a  council to simply investigate what could be  done and whether as it ^was^ contended by some to  say as a absolutely clear legally, and to report their  findings before any definite action should be  taken, but that I at first countenanced the action  of illegible I most explicitly deny.  After this committe has made their report I can  illegible the approval by ENDENTRY technicalities illegible though we might perchance  surmount illegible an expense that I felt  illegible would ^be^ illegible to incur.  I had also by this time  made a illegible  of the illegible  we might  reasonably expect in our favor, which demonstrated to  me it was better to drop the matter for the present as illegible  Your second question was, why I declined to give  those interested the reasons for any change of base. I illegible to say as before that stated, that I had not  changed my base, but that I invited some of the  members of this community to meet me at my office  at a given time, that I might give them my  illegible  in this matter, they however invited others not of our faith and who had previously proven  illegible  to our people to offend and while  those illegible were all presentI did not feel at  liberty to speak as freely on the subject as I  otherwise would have done.  I was there and then  in my own office indirectly accused of being  bribed by one of our own brethren in the presence  of a roomfull of those interested,  ENDENTRY left the office before I had an opportunity of  speaking to him as freely as I otherwise would have  been pleased to do.  These brethren are the facts  in the case as far as I am able to tell them at  present.  If however there is anything further that  you wish to ask I shall be pleased to answer them  as far as I am able.  Awaiting your further  pleasure I remain  Your illegible T. E. Ricks ENDENTRY May 5  8  President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother,  Replying to your ? of ?th net. in which you inquire concerning the propriety of calling Bro. H. P. Hansen, of Salem, to go on a mission to Scandinavia, will say that Brother Hansen is well advanced in years and we do not think his physical strength would warrant us in recommending in for a foreign mission.  We herewith enclose regular blank containing the name of Joseph M vorkman recommended for a mission I am your Brother in the Gospel  T E Ricks ENDENTRY President Wilford Woodruff S L City Sept 12th, 1885.  In exile for the Gospel —  Beloved brother and Friend — Feeling how poor a correspondent  I am not only to you but to all my friends lately, I will  try to pen a few lines — a moments reflection will remind  you that to keep along I have to do considerable that would  be done by others who are absent if they could have liberty  to be at their posts and do their parts. I feel thankful that  I have my liberty as yet and also feel disposed with pleasure  to do all I can to promote the interests of the work in every  way I can. I was sorry to hear of the swelling of your  feet, an acquaintance of mine who was affected the same  way drank freely of celery root beer for a few days and it  left entirely.  Great interest is felt by many as to the approaching term of Court  which meets next Monday. Hopt is the first for trial if a Jury  can be obtained - then Brs. H. Dinwoody  are set for the 28th of this month and after them 18 other cases of  Polygamy and Cohabitation. There is much speculation as to how  text faded first three cases will go, thinking that as the go, others will text faded likely to follow. Somethings have been fixed up so that if  ENDENTRY good faith is kept our brethren in Arizona and all those  in Detroit will feel the benefit of it shortly.  It is not  best to know too much about some of these things.  Our affairs in Mexico have been looking very encouragingly  until a day or two since a telegram arrived as follows  "Contract failed — proposition was withdrawn. We start home tonight."  Thus it looks as if that cup was dashed from our  lips.  The L. J. Nuttall were well  and joyful in the Lord only a few evenings since. My son Washington soon to  see if another case can be got before the U. S. Supreme Court  for another decision by them.  Your letter from Ashleys Fork was read by the presidency and by John H. Smith, who start- -ted day before yesterday to visit those settlements in company  in company of Prest. A. Hatch in hopes to regulate some of  those matters. It is not yet determined whether the semi- annual ^Conference^ will be held, or if so, where?  The work goes on good and strong in the Logan Temple, and without cessation, generally over 100 daily.  Last week we got off a reinforcement of Elders with President  Wm M. Palmer to the N. Western States — and last week and this we  have got off companies to the Southern States and expect to  send 20 more early in next month to Bro. Morgan's aid  yesterday and day before 3 cases from Heber City were before the  Commission and 2 were sent to the Grand Jury, so the work goes on, with an occasionable lull. We have just had a heavy quiet  rain that has turned to snow on the Mts. and has greatly cooled  the atmosphere and exchanged deep dust for mud. Bro. Jaques will inform you of your family as he is better  posted than I am as to their condition. I hope your enemies  may not find you and that your health may be preserved unto you  with much comfort of the Spirit to cheer you in your loneliness.  Your brother in the Everlasting Covenant  F. D. Richards. ENDENTRY Prest. W. Woodruff  S L City  Feb. 18th 1886  In Obscurity  Dear Brother. I am thankful to learn this mor- ning that you are still unfound by your hunters.  On hearing some one say that papers had been seen in Mchands of an officer the day the search was made here -- (Feb 8th) I enquired it out and this morning am furnished the following, by brother William Chinerell. He says that br. John Barrell, the brother of Charles Barrell whose family live in the base- ment of this Historian Building, was present when the officers came to their door and demanded to know by what authority he undertook to make the search upon which the officer, who he says was Capt Greenman took from his pocket five papers one had the name of John Taylor on its outside, another had Geo. Q. Cannon and a third had W. Woodruff, but the other two he did not get to see the names they bore. By this you see how nearly you came to having the paper served on you.  Yesterday afternoon I went in company with J. H. Smith H. J. Grant, and J. W. Taylor and visited Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon, who ENDENTRY his residence at his farm. The doctors Anderson and Young, had dressed his wounds and he had slept about two hours and felt nice bright and joyful on seeing us. He conversed freely, but we rather carefully avoided making conversation so as not to weary him too much His face is somewhat marred just more but the doctors think it will so heal as not to be much scarred.  We spent one hour or so with him anointed and blessed him. His family were all in the City and before the Inquisition by which they ^officials^ endeavor to make all they can against him.  Fairchild (E. L.) went on his way. We learn by a  letter from him dated at the Palace Hotel ^San-Francisco^ of his safe arrival at that place. Hill and Arnold went on to California. Bro Cannon's whole affair seems very strange but the facts are that his departure was known and he was given away right at the start.  Br. Henry Dinwoodey is having a very interesting time today in the Court. It appears that what was done in his case yesterday has to be done over again and probably ^in^ another way. I hope  you may successfully elude your pursuers still. F.M.L. and B.Y. are in hiding but I know not where. I hear from them occasion- ally. I am still thankfully your brother in the Gospel  F. D. Richards. ENDENTRY S L City Feb 20 1886  Dear Brother  S. H. Hill and Cannon when the letter was arrested. Fairbanks is supposed to have had with him twelve thousand dollars, with which to make a payment on the purchase of a place which the brethren in Chihuahua had con- cluded to purchase of Signior Campo, if I recollect right.  B. Y. and Taylor was well the last I heard of him. I had a letter from him today.  Your warm friend Ezra T. Clark send his very kind re- membrance to you and wished me to say that he would come any night whenever you say and take you safely to his place where he can keep you securely from knowledge of others and he will esteem it a pleasure to do so whenever you will let him know.  I want to know what you have to say about letting brother Andrew Jensen have the free access to all the books and ENDENTRY records in the office as he wants. It has not seemed proper to me to permit it. He asked for the privilege to examine and verify some dates which I told him he could do, but I find that he means the liberty to examine every book case and get everything and everything that he may wish to find and plunder it for his private interests, and to make his paper interesting. I shut him off and told him plainly that I could not permit it. That he must have liberty from you or Prest Taylor I before he could be permitted to have free access to the office and all it contains.

He now receives for his services $2.50 per day, which is about $65.00 per month.  He is a steady and trustworthy clerk, and has worked in the Histo- rian's Office seven years. He has assisted to emigrate members of his family from Great Britain, and  has been struggling to secure him- self a home in the city. He manifests a good degree of faith- fulness and efficiency.  In view of the foregoing ENDENTRY we unite in respectfully recom- mending that his pay be increased to seventy five dollars per month.  Your brethren in the Gospel,  F. D. Richards, John Jaques.

ENDENTRY President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  June 14, 1889  My Dear Sir,  I have the pleasure to report that the work of translating the Book of Mormon into the Jewish language, which was commenced by brother Edward Isaacson on or about the 4th of  May 1888, is now stated by him to be complete. He delivered to me the last sheets on Saturday the 8th of this month, and said it was as well and correctly done as he was capable of doing it considering his limited acquaintance with the English language.  To make the best of this work possible within my power, Brother Morris Behrman has assisted me to revise the work by reading the translation to me in English, by which means we were enabled to make fre- quent corrections, but I think the work must have a much more careful and thorough revision than we are capable of giving it before I could consent to its publication  The translation occupies a thousand pages of knickerbocker tablet paper and has the appearance of being tolerably well written.  The amount paid br Edward Isaacson for ENDENTRY translating the work is eight hundred and fifteen dollars ($815 00/100). That paid to brother Morris Behrman for assisting in the revision of it is five hundred and ninety ($590 00/100) dollars.  Respectfully submitted with the earnest hope that it may not be long till we can see our way clear to have this work published and sent abroad unto all the House of Israel.  Yours in the Gospel  F.

Sometime last October Brother Moab, Emery County in this Territory informed me that a short line previous he had fallen in company with a stranger who was traveling through the Territory, and who in conversation informed him that on a previous occasion as he was passing through with a team (if I recollect right) he found by the way side a Record Book containing various matters of what might be of interest only to the one who had lost it and stating ^also^ that the names of several of our leading men were contained in it.  Brother Peterson further stated that this man offered to return the Record if he knew who to return it to and gave Br. P. his name and address which is "N. S. Batcheller. Freedom, Lasalle Co Ills."  On the 15th of last October I addressed a note to Mr Batcheller as above permitting him to send it to this address and offering to pay the necessary expressage but have received no reply. Most truly F. D. Richards.  ENDENTRY President Woodruff. S L City  March 21st 1889. and Council—  Beloved Brethren—I think I ought to inform you of our progress in the translation and revision of the Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language.  Last Saturday—the 16th inst—brother Isaacson handed in anstalment of the translation that extended to page 459 of the last English Edition, which leaves 164 pages to complete the translation. He says he will have it finished by the last of April, as he does quite regularly four pages each day.  Concerning the Revision—Brother Behrman and I are pursuing this part of the labor, by his reading the translation back to me in English thus noting and correcting all apparent defects to the best of our ability, and expect to have our part accomplished about the same time as the translation will be.  Although we are doing the best we can at this, still I am desirous that some more competent test should be applied than we are able to give it.  In this connexion I would ask—Is it not time to consider the necessary arrangements preparatory to the printing and publishing of this work, which,  ENDENTRY on account of it being in another language may require time to order the necessary type, paper, and.c. and this may be attended with delay—  In view of all the circumstances I deem it deem it important to present the condition of the work before you in time to provide for a further revision if advisable and to prevent unnecessary delay in procuring the material for its publication.  Respectfully submitted,  F. D. Richards. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Feb. 20, 1896.  To President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors.  Dear Brethren:  In accordance with your instructions we have considered  sister Sorenson's Manuscript on "What Women should Know".  We have not undertaken to correct errors of spelling, punctuation,  grammar or idioms, or the arrangement of sentences and paragraphs, as  we have not supposed that to be required of us.  There are many good things in the work, useful for married people  to know. We regard it as a work for professional medical and surgical men and women, midwives and nurses, and for married people, and not for lying around loose on the table, accessible to boys and girls, and  therefore not appropriate for the most general circulation and perusal, as it contains specific details concerning procreation and parturition, with minute descriptions and measurements of woman's genital organs, and ^their^ environments.  Although apparently a midwife and nurse of considerable experience,  yet the author talks with the ardor and somewhat of the dogmatism of a new and zealous convert, and is rather strict and rigid, indeed with a tendency toward radical extremes in the advocacy of the views of her ENDENTRY new and special school of the healing doctrine, art and practice, regarding food and abstention, dis4 illegible letters^car^ding tonics and stimulants and almost all medicines, and relying on water treatment, massage,  and the healing forces of nature almost entirely, but including  faith and priestly administration.  Of course many nurses, midwives, medical and surgical^,^ and  other people of age and experience, will not accept her exclusive doctrines and practice, at least not fully. Therefore we consider that such a professional treatise and text-book, designed to be  urged upon the sisters very generally as of undoubted authority, should, before publication or printing, be submitted to a competent committee of men and women in the medical and surgical professions and business, in order that the book, when published, may not be  one-sided, and may have greater weight with the people whom its  contents so much concern, and greater claim on the patronage of  those who will be expected to purchase and use it.  We remain,  Very respectfully your brethren in the Gospel,  F. D. Richards, John Jaques A. milton Musser ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.  To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren -- In the case of James Polson and Christian A. Christensen, the latter charged with removing and taking possession of 130 rods of fence belonging to the former, in August 1892, we are unable to affirm ^recommend the affirmation of^ the decision of the High Council of Bannock Stake, or of the Bishop's Court of Basalt Ward. Whether or not Brother Christensen (with his son, then under age) did wrong in removing the fence depends upon whether he or Brother Polson owned the land, and where the proper boundary line ran, which latter questions were not of a kind to be settled by Church Councils, but by competent legal authority. The records before us do not show these questions satisfactorily.  Brother Christensen objected to the juris-diction of the Church courts on questions of land titles and bounda- ries.  We have no minutes of the proceedings of the High Council, excepting their decision affirming the decision of the Bishops Court, to the effect that Brother Christensen replace the fence in as good condition as before, by July 1, 1894, or be disfellowshipped. We do not know on what the High Council based their decision, other than the minutes of the Bishop's court.  Brother Christensen was not in attendance, being at Smithfield. If the fence as on Brother Christensen's land, he had a right to ENDENTRY remove it, but not to appropriate it. If it was on Brother Polson's land, or on the dividing line, then Brother Christensen had no right either to remove or appropriate i the fence, and should make restitution, if he has not done so.  We therefore recommend that the case be referred again to the High Council of the Bannock  Stake, and that it would ^be well^ for a committee of arbitration to consider the matter, especially with reference to the actual legal ownership of the land on which the fence stood, and the location of the boundary line or lines thereof, those questions being the basis ^for the settlement^ of the whole case.

Smith.  Dear Brethren  Your esteemed communication,  inclosing one from Brother Andrew Jensen, would have been answered some time ago, had not illness prevented a  due consideration of the subject, which we have carefully and prayerfully canvassed.  There is, in Bro. Jensen's "Historical Record," a large amount of valuable historical information, and we think he is entitled to much credit for his work on the same.  He now offers to turn over, as a free gift to the Church, his "Historical Record," subscrip- tion list, good will of the concern, andc., with certain historical manuscripts which he has written.  So far as this donation proffered is concerned, abstractly considered, it is an act of generosity. ENDENTRY But to this proposition another is at- tached, which is that he be taken into the employ of the Historian's Office, and this latter proposition, in its various bearings, has caused the most anxious thought.  He manifests great desire to push himself into the office. It appears to us to be a decided case of the man seeking the office, which is not the best of recom- mendations.  He offers to work either with or without pay, but in fact he by no means expects to work without material compensation.  He himself says he considers he is worthy of his hire. We understand that he would expect compensation, which of course would be a reasonable expecta- tion, if he was employed in the Historian's Office. This part of his offer leads us to think that he has an ax to grind.  He offers to work either in the office or to travel. In conversation, however,  at various times, he has repeatedly said that he does not want to sit in the office and work regularly day after day, ENDENTRY President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  March 16, 18890  Dear Brother-  Bishop Pleasant Green Taylor|P. G. Taylor of the Hanisville Ward of Weber Stake, informs me that several mem- bers of his ward, among others five of his sons, have en- tered lands in Idaho, previous however to the late decision of the U. S. Supreme Court declaring the Idaho test oath constitutional.  With this new feature added to their political status the Bishop desires to know how to advise these people of his ward. He says they, and espectially his sons, will not allow their names to be erased from the church record in order to prove up their claims, that they will relinquish their claims to the land rather than jeopardize their standing or place themselves in any doubtful position in their relations to the church.  The answer to Bp. Taylor's question is not only applicable to his people, but it becomes a matter of such general importance that I do not feel prepared to answer it myself, but think it should be decided by the First  Presidency for the benefit of all those who are similarly situated.  Your early answer to this will be highly appreciated as quite a number are waiting to act in accordance ENDENTRY with your conclusion.  Brother Taylor also desires your instruction in the following case that exists in his ward:  A widow -- Sister Keyes -- whose husband died about a year and a half ago, has five living children and one dead by this man. Although they were sealed in the Endowment House because she refused to be married in any other way, it was not long till he declared his utter unbelief in the ordinances they had received together, forbade her and the children to attend meetings, became exceedingly profane, cursed God and the ordinances and his wife for correcting the children, refused to pay tithing or to aid the poor in any way notwithstanding he was labored with in patience and longsuffering. He had no faith in a  hereafter or that he could have his wife and children in a life to come.  Since his husband's death this Sister and her  children attend meetings and Sunday schools, and Bp Taylor says she has been always a faithful and exemplary woman, and she wishes to be released from her deceased husband with liberty to be united to some righteous man according to the order of the Gospel, and he thinks she ought to have that privilege.

Dear Brethren:  Your Committee, to whom you referred the consideration of Elder B. H. Roberts' new work entitled, "A New Witness For God", respectfully represent that they have read it with great care, and be- lieve it to be a valuable addition to our Church literature. They find nothing therein calling for adverse criticism, but to the contrary there is harmony in its chapters, which gives much strength to its arguments, all of which point directly to the evidences, first, of the need of a new witness for God, and next, that Joseph, the Priophet, was that witness. The truths are emphasized on lines of reasoning, dif- ferent from those common to our Elders, which carries to the work a  freshness and an interest that will, we think, attract students, and develop oin our youth and others an increased love for the study of the great latter-day work. Brother Roberts' work collates and condenses a large amount of useful and important information, historical and theological, which is often not readily accessa^i^ble to the Elders and members of the church, but which tends to broaden their views and ENDENTRY enlarge and enlighten their understanding of various vital matters connected with the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  We are also of the opinion that it would be a valuable work to publish to the world at large, as setting forth and sustaining the fundamental truths of the work of the Lord in this last dispensation.  Respectfully and affectionately,  Your Committee,  F. D. Richards. John Jaques. Geo. Reynolds  We have also read, revised and approved the Manuscript of Elder F. F.

Dear Brethren, Your committee having carefully considered the case between Thomas Broadbent and J. C. B. Jensen, heard and determined by the Bishop's Court of the Elsinore Ward, and subsequently by the High Council of the Sevier Stake, have reached the conclusion that the decision of the Bishop's Court, as later affirmed by the High Council, is not justified by the evidence of the record.  To our minds the conclusion that there had been one definite understanding between the brethren named as to the use of the roadway over the land claimed by Brother Jensen is not war- ranted by the evidence in the case, the testimony showing clearly that a larger quantity of land be- longing to Brother Thomas Broadbent had been and is still used for waste water-way for the benefit of Brother Jensen than that used for a roadway by Brother Broadbent and belonging to Brother Jensen. That such ditches were beneficially used by Brother Broadbent himself in no way lessens, in our view, the value accruing to Brother Jensen.  It is clearly shown by the record that the roadway was used previous to the acquirement of the land by Brother Jensen, thus giving an acquired right to those who used it. One of the witnesses advised, ENDENTRY the parties to settle without the payment of the Five Dollars mentioned as the amount demanded by Brother Jensen, and the payment of which was refused by Brother Broadbent, saying that he thought, in the use of the necessary lands for waste water-way, that Brother Jensen had the best end of the bargain. To us it appears singular that the High Council should have recognized the importance and legal bearings of necessary rights of way for water ditches over public and private lands, and seemingly ignored at the same time the claims of roads or highways under similar conditions.  The letter of President Seegmiller to Brother Broad- bent, conveying a warning, if not a covert threat, is a remarkable exhibition of the lack of good judgment, and shows, to our minds, a bias that would naturally becloud his judgment, if not render it of doubtful value.  By reason of these findings we are, in this case, unable to recommend the affirmation of the decision, but would recommend that Brother Broadbent make the road on his own land, and that Brother Jensen make the waste water ditches on his land, provided that can be done without serious loss to either party.  That adjustment, in our view, would lead ultimately to the most sat- isfactory results, and might remove a bone of contention which if continued might seriously injure both parties and possibly affect, more or less, the  general public in that stake of Zion. ENDENTRY If, however, that cannot be accomplished without se- riously damaging both parties, or either of them, we would recommend the free use of the existing road by Brother Broadbent, and are equally free use of the existing water ditches by Brother Jensen, the use of the one kind being in full compensation for the use of the other.  Five dollars being the amount that prevented a full settlement heretofore, the charge of $2000 as damages per year for the use of the road, seems ridiculous to us.  We are not able to see that the decision, as rendered by the Bishop's Court and affirmed by the High Council, eis at all warranted by the testimony, but, on the contrary, is arbitrary, and is in conflict with the testimony. If settlement of this difficulty can be made on the basis of the use of the road on exchange for the use of the ditches conveying waste water, that will be in harmony with and finally accomplish the recommenda- tion of the teachers who so patiently labored on the lines of justice and so persistently urged recon- siliation.

Richards ENDENTRY Papeete Tahiti  Sept 10/97 To the First Presidency  Salt Lake City, Utah Dear Brethren -  We have been work- ing on Tahiti for one month back. The elders are making an effort to  work among the people without "purse or script."  Thus far they have received  very kind treatment.  This course con't be followed here very successfully so  long as the government does not interfere and I apprehend ittle trouble from that source so long as we attend wisely to our duties. So far as I am able to deter- mine we are making a good  impression among the natives ENDENTRY Some are becoming quite inquisi- tive and I trust that by the end of a  year we shall begin to make a record among them, however, I feel that we should not despair though we do not receive immediate response  to our efforts.  I note that converts have  been made on the various islands where the gospel has been taken and I con no reason why this island should be an exception.  There is arumor spreading very rapidly in this part and at the other islands of this mission that Joeph Smith Jr. the president of the Josephite Church will be here in December and remain un- til after April Conference.  While I trust that it is only a rumor I fear that the arrival of such a person will make times lively ENDENTRY for us here.  I understand  Mr. Burton the president of the mission here is one of the most influential members of the Josephite Church and it may be possible that Mr. Smith has yielded to his persuasion to come here this being one of their strongest missions.  They have appointed their April conferene to be held at our strongest branch.  Takaroa.  We are quite anxious to get our build- ing completed there by that time. If you consider it wise we should be pleased to have a person some- what handy with carpenter tools and can do some plastering as one of four coming this fall.  The elders in general are progress ENDENTRY ing well with the language.  I have talked with Maputu and he thinks that the natives are ready to subscibe for copies of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.  I feel quite confident  that from $13,000.00 to $14,000.00 Chilian com can be raised in advance for  that purpose by giving the natives receipts entitling them to a copy when published.  The time is fully ripe to have these books among them if you intend that they should have them.  I have allotted the work of translation between Elders Chamb- lin, Willey and myself.  We have access to a translation of the French  Tahitian grammar and vocabulary and believe with this assistance we can make a very correct trans- lation.  ENDENTRY he does not want to be in the office much, but he wants to have a desk here, so he can have free run of the papers and documents in the office, but he would like most of the time to travel about the country, in and through the various stakes and wards, to collect historical information, with a view to its publication in his "Historical Record," or other works. Knowing this to be his cherished ambition, which he seems to think he was expressly born to realize; the subject assumes another phase, and a very important one.  Several questions here arise.  Would it be well for the Historian's Office to assume to publish a periodical similar to the "Historical Record"?  Would it be well for the Historian's  Office to employ and authorize Brother Jensen to travel most of his time around in the various stakes and wards to collect historical data? ENDENTRY He is manifestly a man of ambition, who would make much of his authority and position, and would not be backward  in presuming considerably on the same. He would require his regular compensation, and probably in addition would want to be  entertained and helped along as a person of  some importance and authority, as a  sort of Historian's Office missionary; would  expect R.R. passes, travelling expenses,  recommendations to presidents of stakes, bishops, or other prominent persons in stakes  or wards, or a sort of virtual carte blanche to ask local aid in his labors. Whether  it would be advisable to establish such a func tionary, as an appendage to the Historian's  Office, is a serious question, at least under  the present peculiar circumstances.  The chief complaint in the case of  Milando Pratt was that he liked to be  away from the office, except when it  suited him to be here. He was so irregular  in his attendance that the office could  seldom rely on his coming to work at  any regular time, no matter how much  ENDENTRY he might be needed, the habit being a growing  one and probably resulting from having  been employed at one time in copying  at so much per hundred words, and regular  hours not being so necessary at that kind  of work.  But it does not seem advisable to  continue, or rather to renew, such desulto- ry and intermittant sort of labor in this  office, as it is not pleasant, being difficult  to keep track of, and it has a rather loose  and demoralizing influence on regularity  of attendance in other clerks.  There is another light in which Brother  Jensen's proposal may be considered. If the  offer of his magazine, manuscripts, andc., may  be regarded in the light of a bait, or bribe,  or purchase, or inducement of employ- ment in the service of the Historian's Office,  and of his necessarily continued superin- tendence and management of the  "Historical Record," or any publication  ENDENTRY of the Historian's Office, then it may be con- sidered bad policy and a bad precedent to  accept the offer and to employ Brother Jensen,  so as to furnish ground for a shadow of claim  to such obligation or lien on the office.  It would be bad policy for this office to  accept of any such offer from any man,  if there was coupled with it any obligation, written or verbal, understood or implied,  that where the donation went the donor  must be also and necessarily continue  as a part of it, a tacitly recognized if not  essential part of it. Very unpleasant  it would be, if it was found desirable  at any time afterward, and on any  account, to dispense with his services,  as he then could and might go about  saying what great things he had done  for the office, how badly it had used him, and how ungrateful it had been to him  for the sacrifice of his own private business  which he had made for it and to enter  its employ. All such things are possi- ble where a man fails to realize his  ambitions. ENDENTRY As a regular clerk in the office, to work  steadily regular hours at any kind of work  that might come along, the same as other clerks, it is doubtful if Brother Jensen  would be much of a success. He does  not want to do it if he can help it. That  is not his desire. His ambition reaches  forth in other directions, and consequent- ly he would chafe and be ill-suited and  dissatisfied under the restriction of  steady daily clerk work, either routine,  or varied by anything that might come  along.  Furthermore, although he has  good qualifications for historical work, yet he is such a persistent pusher of  himself and his projects that he soon  gets wearisome. He is the kind of man  who want to pry into the bottom of  everything, to know just what everybody  else in the office was doing, and would  look into and over their work to find out ENDENTRY a valuable qualification sometimes, but  at other times very inconvenient, and  apt to cause unpleasantness and disagree- able friction. He had a seat in the  office for a few weeks some two or three years  ago, doing some work of his, so the office  has had a little experience in this way.   It is disagreeable to have to snub a man  who is too forward in trying to find out  what other people are doing and what  their immediate business is, though some- times it is worse for him to see and know  everything that is going on and being done,  whether it concerns him or not.  He has long wanted to establish  himself where he can have frequent  and unrestricted interviews with the  authorities of the church, and a man who is continually wanting and seeking  such occasions is likely to become tiresome  and troublesome, indeed something of  a bore.  He is not the kind of man that  we are anxious to employ as a clerk, at the present time at least. If it was  ENDENTRY desirable to employ another clerk in the  Historian's Office, one who is less presuming, without such personal aspirations and  ambitions to push forward, and who  would be willing to do any sort of plain  work required any and every day, would  be much more suitable to the present  condition of things. He ought also to  be a fairly good penman, and it would  be well if he were a shorthand writer, in both of which particulars we believe  Brother Jensen is lacking.  If the Church was in more favorable  circumstances, financially and otherwise and the Historian's Office had a larger  staff of employes to work more freely and  especially on Church History proper, it might  have been well to employ Brother Jensen  as one of them, but it seems hardly  advisable under the present restricted  condition of things, as there are in the  office but few proper and scarcely any  ENDENTRY documents to be used, and it is uncertain  how long these conditions will continue, or  the office will retain its present quarters,  or have a roof over it, or to what shifts it  will be put for a local habitation.  At  present little more than ordinary current  work can be done, the main object being  to take care of what we have and obtain  from time to time, and keep the old ship  off the breakers, if possible, while running  under bare poles in the storm, rather  than to be spreading out sail and  unnecessarily increasing work and  expenses.  The recent decision of the court of last  resort, sustaining as constitutional  the infamous Idaho test oath, opens the  way to the admittance of that territory as  a state into the Union with that oath  intact, which virtually disfranchised  every Latterday Saint in that territory or  State.  Further, if Idaho can go into the  Union with a constitutional plank of  that unjust, arrogant, and stringent  ENDENTRY character, as the Senate Committee  recommends, Utah can be admitted  with a consitution having the same  disqualification, and thus disfranchise- ment of Latterday Saints will be gene- ral and may become universal. To  what indignities, expenses, and losses, or into what straits the Church and  the people may then be put, is easier  to imagine than describe.  Then the election just had in this city  is likely to have results which will greatly  intensify and aggravate the unpleasant- ness of the present condition of things. Besides, if the election of Salt Lake City can be determined by fraud, so can the  election of any other city in the territory,  and probably of some counties, at the  will of our enemies, and without  disfranchisement by law.  They have  now learned how to do these things  with facility, and apparently with im- ENDENTRY punity, for it seems useless to look to the  courts for prevention or redress, as with  our enemies it is partisan and persecu- tive business from beginning to end.  Moreover the unfortunate and un- expected leaning of the Supreme Court  of the United States in favor of pains  and penalties for opinions and for con- science' sake, as manifested in the late  decision, renders it probable that any  week we may hear of the confiscation  of the property of the Church being sus tained by the same court, which would  be likely to leave the Church in an ex- tremely awkward situation.  Considering all these things, especially  the present and probable financial and  political conditions, we are more than  ever convinced that it would not be well  to accept Brother Jensen's proposition,  as it would require considerable branching out into labors and expenditures at an  exceedingly inopportune time and used peculiarly forbidding circumstances. A competent, discreet, and trustworthy  ENDENTRY clerk of all work, rather than a specialist,  is the best kind to have in the Historian's Office now.  As Brother Jensen represents that he is  able to carry on his publication as a private  business, support his family, and pay his  bills at the "Deseret News" office, it seems to  us, that it would be well for him to con- tinue to do so. If at any time the  Church should desire the use of any  historical information which he may  have gathered, it could probably be  had for a reasonable remuneration.  We have herein given our views on the  subject frankly and at large, looking  solely to the best interest of the office and  the Church, in the present condition of  things, at the same time not wishing  to detract in the least from the credit  due to Brother Jensen for the work he has done. In some respects we regret  ENDENTRY that we cannot return a more favorable  answer. But we have endeavored  to take a broad and just view of the  subject, bringing probabilities also  into account, as requested in your  letter.  Finally, whether you decide to  decline or accept Brother Jensen's  offer, we shall be happy to do all we  can to further your wishes.  We remain Your brethren in  the Gospel  F. D.

Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-  In reply to your letter of June 19th, 1896, covering a Resolution of the High Council of Salt Lake Stake, concerning which an action of the Apostles was desired, I desire to state, that on Tuesday the 7th day of July, the Apostles were together in Council (except Moses Thatcher, A. H. Lund and A. H. Cannon), and had the Rsolution of the High Council under consideration.  After mature deliberation, it was moved by Elder Brigham Young and seconded by Elder John H. Smith, and unanimously voted, that, "This Council does not recognize the right of one of our number on his own volition to go into any organized Stake of Zion, and abrogate and set aside a standing regulation established by the President of the Church, and endorsed by the High Council of that Stake".  Most respectfully,  _______________, President.  ________________Secretary.   (signature of F. D. Richards) ENDENTRY
