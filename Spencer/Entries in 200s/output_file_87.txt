Elder Lot Smith. Dear Brother - I have felt a desire to write to you for some time past. President Taylor is receiving letters from persons who leave your fort and go to other places to settle. They complain bitterly of your treatment of them in the settlement of their accounts. Among others, the Pitkins said that their property was priced very low when taken in, and very high when taken out. They said they gave in a wagon worth $125, which was priced at $50, and got a wagon in return good for nothing but old iron, and he was forced to sign a bill of receipt with an iron rod over his head, or something of that kind. Now of course these  stories are all on one side of the question But they have their effect against you, and I would like not to have any more such stories come to the First Pres- idency, if possible to avoid it.

There is hardly any man speaks well of you, who leaves your settlement. They generally go away dissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatch was called by the authorities to go to Savoy, to assist Brother Titien.

Maori Saints—that occupies the most prominent place in your communication we will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant to encourage the  to Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not having been altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn- ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability for such work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have felt that a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and their families might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as you and your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet and overcome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in their mode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains. Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants of the white races are treated—permit them when they reach here to make a way for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for their necessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will be desirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one or more of the brethren who know their language and who have love and ENDENTRY  in some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitable to them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with the modes of life that will be most advantageous to them.

Further, we should be pleased to have you continue your supervision over them when they reach their future home, that they still may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance and support that they will undoubtedly need.

The stringency of the times is such that a number of the brethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able to raise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure has had to be postponed.

Reports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions, but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future an Annual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answer the purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incomplete covering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of the calander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of all reliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent and made them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that this change will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if an effort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dut to these things, to have them as perfect as possible.

As to  just how the courts would interpret this is a  question that the future only could decide and  to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly  be made on this technicality in case of our  obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably  entail considerable expenses and of course with our  favorable chances of losing even then.   at our last election indicated very strongly to  me that it was an absolute impossibility to  acquire the necessary votes for its removal at the coming election and that an almost super human  ENDENTRY  near that number involving an outlay of  thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a  serious division in the good feelings and unity of  our people that would inevitably result from  a contest of this nature.

The truths are emphasized on lines of reasoning, dif- ferent from those common to our Elders, which carries to the work a  freshness and an interest that will, we think, attract students, and develop  great latter-day work.

Jensen, heard and determined by the Bishop's Court of the Elsinore Ward, and subsequently by the High Council of the Sevier Stake, have reached the conclusion that the decision of the Bishop's Court, as later affirmed by the High Council, is not justified by the evidence of the record.   that there had been one definite understanding between the brethren named as to the use of the roadway over the land claimed by Brother Jensen is not war- ranted by the evidence in the case, the testimony showing clearly that a larger quantity of land be- longing to Brother Thomas Broadbent had been and is still used for waste water-way for the benefit of Brother Jensen than that used for a roadway by Brother Broadbent and belonging to Brother Jensen. That such ditches were beneficially used by Brother Broadbent himself in no way lessens, in our view, the value accruing to Brother Jensen.   clearly shown by the record that the roadway was used previous to the acquirement of the land by Brother Jensen, thus giving an acquired right to those who used it. One of the witnesses advised, ENDENTRY  Five Dollars mentioned as the amount demanded by Brother Jensen, and the payment of which was refused by Brother Broadbent, saying that he thought, in the use of the necessary lands for waste water-way, that Brother Jensen had the best end of the bargain. To us it appears singular that the High Council should have recognized the importance and legal bearings of necessary rights of way for water ditches over public and private lands, and seemingly ignored at the same time the claims of roads or highways under similar conditions.   bent, conveying a warning, if not a covert threat, is a remarkable exhibition of the lack of good judgment, and shows, to our minds, a bias that would naturally becloud his judgment, if not render it of doubtful value.   unable to recommend the affirmation of the decision, but would recommend that Brother Broadbent make the road on his own land, and that Brother Jensen make the waste water ditches on his land, provided that can be done without serious loss to either party.   in our view, would lead ultimately to the most sat- isfactory results, and might remove a bone of contention which if continued might seriously injure both parties and possibly affect, more or less, the  general public in that stake of Zion. ENDENTRY  riously damaging both parties, or either of them, we would recommend the free use of the existing road by Brother Broadbent, and are equally free use of the existing water ditches by Brother Jensen, the use of the one kind being in full compensation for the use of the other.  Five dollars being the amount that prevented a full settlement heretofore, the charge of $20 ridiculous to us.   Bishop's Court and affirmed by the High Council,  all warranted by the testimony, but, on the contrary, is arbitrary, and is in conflict with the testimony. If settlement of this difficulty can be made on the basis of the use of the road on exchange for the use of the ditches conveying waste water, that will be in harmony with and finally accomplish the recommenda- tion of the teachers who so patiently labored on the lines of justice and so persistently urged recon- siliation.

Knowing this to be his cherished ambition, which he seems to think he was expressly born to realize; the subject assumes another phase, and a very important one.

ENDENTRY  who would make much of his authority and position, and would not be backward  in presuming considerably on the same. He would require his regular compensation, and probably in addition would want to be  entertained and helped along as a person of  some importance and authority, as a  sort of Historian's Office missionary; would  expect R.R. passes, travelling expenses,  recommendations to presidents of stakes, bishops, or other prominent persons in stakes  or wards, or a sort of virtual  to ask local aid in his labors. Whether  it would be advisable to establish such a func tionary, as an appendage to the Historian's  Office, is a serious question, at least under  the present peculiar circumstances.   Milando Pratt was that he liked to be  away from the office, except when it  suited him to be here.

Jensen's proposal may be considered. If the  offer of his magazine, manuscripts, &amp;c., may  be regarded in the light of a bait, or bribe,  or purchase, or inducement of employ- ment in the service of the Historian's Office,  and of his necessarily continued superin- tendence and management of the  "Historical Record," or any publication  ENDENTRY  sidered bad policy and a bad precedent to  accept the offer and to employ Brother Jensen,  so as to furnish ground for a shadow of claim  to such obligation or lien on the office.   accept of any such offer from any man,  if there was coupled with it any obligation, written or verbal, understood or implied,  that where the donation went the donor  must be also and necessarily continue  as a part of it, a tacitly recognized if not  essential part of it. Very unpleasant  it would be, if it was found desirable  at any time afterward, and on any  account, to dispense with his services,  as he then could and might go about  saying what great things he had done  for the office, how badly it had used him, and how ungrateful it had been to him  for the sacrifice of his own private business  which he had made for it and to enter  its employ. All such things are possi- ble where a man fails to realize his  ambitions. ENDENTRY  steadily regular hours at any kind of work  that might come along, the same as other clerks, it is doubtful if Brother Jensen  would be much of a success. He does  not want to do it if he can help it. That  is not his desire. His ambition reaches  forth in other directions, and consequent- ly he would chafe and be ill-suited and  dissatisfied under the restriction of  steady daily clerk work, either routine,  or varied by anything that might come  along.   good qualifications for historical work, yet he is such a persistent pusher of  himself and his projects that he soon  gets wearisome. He is the kind of man  who want to pry into the bottom of  everything, to know just what everybody  else in the office was doing, and would  look into and over their work to find out ENDENTRY  at other times very inconvenient, and  apt to cause unpleasantness and disagree- able friction. He had a seat in the  office for a few weeks some two or three years  ago, doing some work of his, so the office  has had a little experience in this way.   It is disagreeable to have to snub a man  who is too forward in trying to find out  what other people are doing and what  their immediate business is, though some- times it is worse for him to see and know  everything that is going on and being done,  whether it concerns him or not.   himself where he can have frequent  and unrestricted interviews with the  authorities of the church, and a man who is continually wanting and seeking  such occasions is likely to become tiresome  and troublesome, indeed something of  a bore.   we are anxious to employ as a clerk, at the present time at least. If it was  ENDENTRY  Historian's Office, one who is less presuming, without such personal aspirations and  ambitions to push forward, and who  would be willing to do any sort of plain  work required any and every day, would  be much more suitable to the present  condition of things. He ought also to  be a fairly good penman, and it would  be well if he were a shorthand writer, in both of which particulars we believe  Brother Jensen is lacking.   circumstances, financially and otherwise and the Historian's Office had a larger  staff of employes to work more freely and  especially on Church History proper, it might  have been well to employ Brother Jensen  as one of them, but it seems hardly  advisable under the present restricted  condition of things, as there are in the  office but few proper and scarcely any  ENDENTRY  how long these conditions will continue, or  the office will retain its present quarters,  or have a roof over it, or to what shifts it  will be put for a local habitation.  At  present little more than ordinary current  work can be done, the main object being  to take care of what we have and obtain  from time to time, and keep the old ship  off the breakers, if possible, while running  under bare poles in the storm, rather  than to be spreading out sail and  unnecessarily increasing work and  expenses.   resort, sustaining as constitutional  the infamous Idaho test oath, opens the  way to the admittance of that territory as  a state into the Union with that oath  intact, which virtually disfranchised  every Latterday Saint in that territory or  State.

To  what indignities, expenses, and losses, or into what straits the Church and  the people may then be put, is easier  to imagine than describe.   is likely to have results which will greatly  intensify and aggravate the unpleasant- ness of the present condition of things. Besides, if the election of Salt Lake City can be determined by fraud, so can the  election of any other city in the territory,  and probably of some counties, at the  will of our enemies, and without  disfranchisement by law.  They have  now learned how to do these things  with facility, and apparently with im- ENDENTRY  courts for prevention or redress, as with  our enemies it is partisan and persecu- tive business from beginning to end.   expected leaning of the Supreme Court  of the United States in favor of pains  and penalties for opinions and for con- science' sake, as manifested in the late  decision, renders it probable that any  week we may hear of the confiscation  of the property of the Church being sus tained by the same court, which would  be likely to leave the Church in an ex- tremely awkward situation.   the present and probable financial and  political conditions, we are more than  ever convinced that it would not be well  to accept Brother Jensen's proposition,  as it would require considerable branching out into labors and expenditures at an  exceedingly inopportune time and  peculiarly forbidding circumstances. A competent, discreet, and trustworthy  ENDENTRY  is the best kind to have in the Historian's Office now.   able to carry on his publication as a private  business, support his family, and pay his  bills at the "Deseret News" office, it seems to  us, that it would be well for him to con- tinue to do so. If at any time the  Church should desire the use of any  historical information which he may  have gathered, it could probably be  had for a reasonable remuneration.   subject frankly and at large, looking  solely to the best interest of the office and  the Church, in the present condition of  things, at the same time not wishing  to detract in the least from the credit  due to Brother Jensen for the work he has done. In some respects we regret  ENDENTRY  answer. But we have endeavored  to take a broad and just view of the  subject, bringing probabilities also  into account, as requested in your  letter.   decline or accept Brother Jensen's  offer, we shall be happy to do all we  can to further your wishes.   the Gospel   John Jaques.
