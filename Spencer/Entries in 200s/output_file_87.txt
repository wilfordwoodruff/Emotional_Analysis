 S. G. CLARK,  COUNTY AND DISTRICT CLERK,  SEVIER COUNTY.    RICHFIELD, UTAH, Jan. 25th 1898.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:    Enclosed herewith will be found my answer to your letter of the 12th  instant, endorsed by my bishop as requested. The same gives a general statement of   my circumstances financially. My wife is somewhat conserned about my going  at the time designated in my call, Apr 2nd [18]98. She believes that the Lord desires me   to go on that date or I would not have received the call. She feels willing to  take the apparent consequences, to loose her home, which is about all we have, and   to be left without any means of support for herself and children, so long as these   sacrifices are made in doing the will of the Lord. My feelings would be  similar to those of my wife were it not for the fact that your letter contains   the words, "Should there be no reasonable obstacles to hinder you from going."  The Lord in His goodness has given me a good wife and five sweet children, one  of which He has recalled, and alone and unaided except by Him I have   provided them a home and the average necessities and comforts of life. I love  my family next to my God and I do not feel that I will be justified in  leaving them on the date designated unless you find, after considering my  circumstances, that it is the Lord's will, and then I will do so cheerfully, no  matter what may be the consequences, knowing that I am doing His will.  Should you decide that it is the Lords will that I respond to the call on the   date named, I will do all in my power to comply, but should you, on the   other hand, decide that the Lord requires me to place my affairs in order, 
 Richfield, Sevier County, Utah, Jan.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dear Brother:    In responce to your favor of the 12th instant, advis  ing me that my name had been suggested and accepted as a missionary to   Scandinavisa, permit me to make the following statement of my private  affairs:    My indebtedness on my home is $400 the mortage being held by the   Western Loan & Savings Co. of your city, in which company I hold seven  shares of stock the monthly payment on which amounts to $8.40.    I hold certificate of purchase from the State on 40 acres of un-  cultivated University Land on which the annual payment is $19.68.    The County Commissioners have just licensed me to conduct an Abstra^ct^  business in Sevier county and I have purchased records of the value of  $50 which sum must be paid during the present year. I have also purchas-  ed a small tract of land opposite the court house on which to erect a   building for the purpose of this business. This land cost me $120 of wh  which amount I have paid $50 and $50 of the remaining $70 is to be  paid in Nov. of the present year, and the balance, $20, in March 1899,  otherwise I forfeit the amount now paid.    I owe the Jas. M. Peterson Bank of this city, $25; the Manti City   Savings Bank, Manti City, $110, and the Utah Cmo'1 & Savings Bank, Salt   Lake City, $37.50.    I own no real estate or other property that is at present bringing   me revenue, or likely to in the near future, or that I could at present   sell except at a great loss.    My only means of support for myself and family is derived from my  daily labor.    I am at present under contract with Sevier county to complete cer-  tain abstract records for which labor I will receive, when completed,  $175.    At the last session of the County Commissioners I was appointed  Deputy County Clerk for the year 1898 at a salary of $250.    I have about $200 worth of our county warrants which I think will  be paid about the latter part of this year or first of next.    My family consists of my wife and four children, the age of the olde^st^  being eight years. I have no relatives that are in a position to aid  them in my absence therefore whatever provision is made for their sup-  port must be made by me before leaving.    My aged Father living in Idaho, is very week and feeble and has no  one but me to look to for financial aid when the condition of his health  is such that he cannot provide for himself and wife. He has no means of  support excepting his own labor. 
 St. Joseph Mar. 21st 1898.    President Woodruff    Dear Brother;    In as much as  I have been called to  labor as a missionary  I feel that it is my  duty to go, & will be on  hand at the appointed  time    Young Brother  J. W. Richards    John Bushman  Bishop

 The foregoing is a brief outline of the condition of my affairs.  I leave it with you to advise me as to what you think would be proper  for me to do considering all the circumstances. I desire to do the will  of the Lord, whatever it may be, to provide for my family, and to pre-  serve my business integrety.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  J. M. Lauritzen    P. S.    Since submitting the foregoing letter to Bishop Brandley the idea  has presented itself to me that in case you shoyuld decide to grant me an   extension of time in which to prepare for my mission, you might desire  me to state how much time, in my judgment, would be necessary.    After deliberate consideration, I can see no reasonable obstacles  to hinder me from going at any time after the 31st day of Dec. 1898.    J. M. Lauritzen    I believe the above to be  a sure statement    Theo. Brandley  Bishop    I concur and recommend the   adoption of his suggestion.   Pupt him on the reserve list for   the Spring of 1899. J. F. S. 
 S. G. CLARK,  COUNTY AND DISTRICT CLERK,  SEVIER COUNTY.    RICHFIELD, UTAH, 189[8]    and grant me the time suggisted in my letter, or any other length of time,  I wish that you would state that such is the Lord's will conserning  me. This knowledge would be a comfort to my wife as well as to me.  We would not then feel that we were disobeying His commands, but that   we were entitled to, and could claim His blessings in the same degree as  if this call had not been issued. If an extention of time is granted me  I would like to have a definite date fixed when I am to leave so that  I may have something to work to, and during the time that I remain  at home it shall be my aim to improve and fit and prepare myself  for this labor in the cause of truth.    Repectfully your brother in the Gospel.    J. M. Lauritzen. 
 Thatcher Mar. 16, 1898.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff    In reply to  your letter of the 26 ult.  I will say that with the  help of my Heavenly father  I will accept the call and do  the best I can. If nothing  happens I will be there at  October conference. I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel  James A. Duke.    Bp. I. E. D. Zundel

 J. T. Reese  Apl. 29 [18]98.    Benson April 29, 1898    Pres. Wilford Woodruf,    Dear Sir:    About eight  months ago I received a letter  from Box B. asking my circum-  stances & if I would not like to  preach the Gospel. I wrote back  telling my circumstances and  received an answer that no call  would be made of me at that  time, but when I felt able to go, to  report. Since that time I have  been very economical in money mat-  ters but with all my economy, have  been able to save but very little.  I have been trying to get ready to  go this year. Some people have  advised me to go, telling me that    I think if his courage  fail not, it would be  well for him to go on  his mission about the  middle of July, or as soon  there after as he can, not  going wholly by sight, but trus  ting a little in the Lord.

 John WA. Woolf    Manitoba    Pres, Wilford, Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    Your letter dated  May 31st. Informing me that my   name had been suggested and  accpted as a missionary to manitoba,  to hand. With regards to my  feelings about the same, I feel   that it is all right. And I am   willing to go and do the best  that I can. I am tied up at  presant with a beef contract in  British Columbia Supplying  the Contractors on the Crows  Nest Railway with beef.    I have talked with Pres Card about  the matter and will try and be through  with the contract, by the time that   He wishes me to start.

 I would come out all right if I  have but little to start with. Others  have advised me to remain at home  until I have something to start  with, telling me that it would only  be a burden on the church to  keep me. I therefore am almost  puzzled to know what to do, as I  have never been outside of Cache  Valley, and know nothing of the  expense of travelling. I will  therefore submit this matter to   you for your decision.    I have a wife and one child. I have  no home but have been compelled  to rent during the 18 months we  have been married. We had nothing  to start us in life and were forced  to contract several debts. I have had  employment but part of the time  and it has therefore taken about   all I have earned to pay my  debts and keep us going. I have   no property and no one to depend  on for help. I have paid all my  debts and by the middle of June  I think I shall have about $75 to  start me. As for my wife, I think   she will be all right while I am  gone as she has a number of  relatives.    Will you please be kind enough  to advise me what to do & I will  gladly accept your decision.  Should you advise me to go  I shall try and be ready by the   middle of July. Should you  decide for me not to go at present  I shall continue to save what   I can, and will do what I can  to prepare myself to fulfil  a mission. Hoping to hear from  you at an early date, I remain.   Yours Etc J. T. Reese, Benson, Ut.    see over

I should hessitate thus to address you,  were it not for the evidence that the Lord  Jesus himself renders in my behalf: It is  not for us to find fault with the meanes made  use of by the Lord to compass his Will:  It is ours to obey without question.    Why I was chosen to communicate the Lords   Will to you, I know not; neither do I question  the Lords motive: knowing as I do that  He doeth all things well, in his own way  and in his own good time.

 The Lord has manifested himself to me and  guided me these many years; but it is but re-  cently that He brought me under the influence  of his Gospel; as it was restored upon the   earth, through his Prophet and Seer, Joseph  Smith.    I was totally ignorant concerning the "Mormon  Doctrine," until last Nevember when I happened  to come in contact with a Mormon Elder,  who was preaching upon the Street. Since then  I've read the book of Mormon, the Doctine and   Covenants, Orson Pratts works, and several other   volumes: And I found that the truths con-  tained in these books, were at one with the  laws of nature and with natures God.    The Lord had made me familiar with His  Truth; but I was still ignorant concerning his  Ordinances—these I have since subjected  myself to; and I am informed of the Lord,  that they are the [cause] to fit me for my   mission. What that mission is, I know

 no more than you do; but I am sure that  all will be made plain in the Lords own  time.    I will only add that I was babtised on April  third last; and that I recieved the Holy Spirit  through the laying on of hands by Elders  Joseph Smith Perry and [2 words blank] Bennet,   at San Jose, California.    This message to you I recieved in San Francisco,  after attending Conference; its import must  speak for itself—it is a message from the  mouth of the Most High, and deserves the  utmost consideration.    I feel that anything that I can write is but  weak, compared with how I might impress you  were I present with you, but that time I   will have to defer until the Lord opens   a way.    Following is the Lord Jesus Christs  message to you, and through you to the  Church of Jesus Christ.

But about 18 months ago  while working in Kansas City  Missouri caused by a severe cold  which turned chronic I became  afflicted with the Asthma and   since that time I have not had  one happy hour!    This terrible affliction attacked  me with such severeness that  I could do not work whatsoever  and I have not been able to  earn a cent since!    In vain I consulted the so-  called very best physicians  with all their boasted science  They could not cure not even  relieve me of the terrible choking 
 Monroe May 25th1898  President Wilford Woodruff    Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:    Haveing reported myself  nearly ready to take a mission, I thought  I would write and see if I could find  out anything definiate as to when I  will be wanted. There are some things   which I would make preperations to do  if I knew just how long it I could   stay at home, but not knowing I do  not know how to proceed. I do not wish  to dictate but as meansoney is quite scarce  with me at preasent oweing to circumsta-  nces which I cannot avoid I would much  prefer going somewhere in The United States  When I was called before my field of 
 You might consider the advisability of  adding a school music course such as  the natural or Educational courses with  accompanying charts, to the list of school  supplies wanted by Bro. Wood. He says   the people there are quite musical, I have  had some experience teaching singing  in the Dist. school here and with God's help  might be able to do some good in that direction   there. I simply offer this as my own sugges-  tion not as Bro. Woods.    I thought this the best opportunity to   speak about Bro. Woods wants and sincerely  hope I have made no mistake in doing so.    With prayers and best wishes for the  work we are all interested in I am    Yours respty  Clare Wm. Reid

I was almost ready to board the train  when to my great surprise we were called  upon to mourn the loss of my only brother  of my mothers family. My financial cond-  ition is not very good haveing nothing but a   small farm to make my liveing upon, and he  (my brother) haveing all I have in charge it left  things in a very bad condition for me to leave  home. I had only enough money to get the  necessary equipments that a missionary must   have and to take me to my destination and perhaps  a very few dollars besides and the expenses which   we have had to meet has necessarly taken a part  of that so you see my circumstances are not very  good. Now if I go in the near future it will  have to seel [sell] a part of my little farm unless  God in his infinate mercy will open up the

 The message    you. Let the law go forth from Zion  in the Name of the Lord of Hosts, proclaiming  liberty and equal freedom to all my people:   Behold; the people are tired of misrule;  and are ready to forsake their inequity and  establish justice; but they are hampered  and hedged about, on all sides by inequi-  tous laws, and the false doctrines of men,  taught in the Mammon worshipping churches.    Behold, the usurpers of the rights of the  people have become drunk with power, and  in their drunken security, they are casting  prudence to the wind and are about to add  the last straw which will proof the cause   for the overthrow of injustice, and which  will tend to usher in a rule of equity  and a reign of peace; Therefore it is  meet that the law go forth, from Zion pro-  claiming equal rights and equal freedom  unto all nations; Calling upon all man-  kind to repent and forsake their evil ways

He is upward of 60 years of age  and has quite a large family of young children  to support he has been depending upon us boys  for consiterable assistance as he isnt able to do  much hard manuel labor.    My family feels as though they could get along  if I only had the money to keep me there.    I truly hope that I can obtain the necessary   means from some where in the near future  for I feel that it is a God given privelage  when a man is permitted to go on a mission  It seems to me at this time that I have a double  lode to carry oweing to the fact that I could  not meet you at the appointed time.

Behold; there are millions of men and women  in all civilized lands, hopeing and praying for  the ushering in of the Commonwealth of God;  but they are as yet following blind leaders;  Therefore it is meet that you make known unto   them the Will of their Lord, and that you  guide them, and that you anchor them se-  curely in Zion.
