 To The First Presidency. Dear Brethren:- The Mss sent to the Historian's office prepared by Elder E. H. Nye, Prsident of the California Mission, has been carefully examined. While it contains many good points on the first principles of the Gospel, it appears to be too voluminous for popular use as a tract. If the various subjects it treats of were presented under the separate headings it contains, it would perhaps be better adapted for circu- lation, but even in that case the matter would have to be re-written. As there are now in print many tracts treating on the subjects con- tained in the MSS, the necessity for publishing it does not appear imperative.  In any event careful revision and much labor would be  required before it would be suitable for publication.  All of which  is respectfully submitted.   (signature of F.

With the proviso that this may be modified as decided by the High Council. The only differences in these terms of the decision and those admitted to be proper by the accused are these: He thinks that $2  sufficient cash amount for a woman and three children, and the Council decide that $4 per week is the proper amount considering the circumstances of all the parties. Also he objects to  of his children, claiming that he wants the ENDENTRY  care for them; while the Council decide that the children shall be  home under the care of their mother, and in case of any change in the conditions, requiring a change in the terms of the decision, the matter shall be determined by arbitration in the manner provided by that decision. The other part of the family of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr. have been provided for, it appears, by the property deeded to their mother   and explanations of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr that he did obtain and furnish to his wife Annie an instrument to prevent conception and request her to use it for that purpose, the requirement of the Council that he ask  very proper and a merciful disposition of the matter.

Nevertheless it contains a number of wholesome and seasonable suggestions, well worthy the consideration of thoughtful and prayerful Elders.  Yet, after all, there is nothing in the teachings of the Savior and his Apostles, ancient or modern, in support of the  methods and disipline urged by the author.   would not be a suitable work to publish as a guide to preaching, for the Elders of the church, who are commended to speak that which is given them by the spirit, when it becomes their duty to preach and teach.   ENDENTRY      Dear Brethren:-   recording of  of the dead, have been duly considered by the Church Historian and his assistants and by a majority of the Directors of the Genealogical Society, and their unanimous decision is, that it is inexpedient to entrust a work of such magnitude and importance as that proposed, to one person or to any private agency, Nor does it appear from the docu- ments submitted that the evils complained of would be remedied by the  scheme proposed.  It would seem more in keeping with the order of the Church and of Temple Work to place this matter under the supervision of the Temple Recorders and Presidents.       ENDENTRY      Dear Brethren:-   entitled "Children of God", by Brother Brigham City, according to your request, we beg to report as follows:   trinal points with which it treats; the style of the work exhi- bits much taste and literary ability, and the descriptive matter is striking and attractive.  Yet we would not recommend the en- dorsement of the authorities of the Church in its publication, as that would make the Church, to some extent at least, responsible for its theories, and might be used to urge the sale of the book in a way that would not be desirable.  We are of the opinion that permission might be given to the author to publish the work on his own responsibility, without the seal of sanction from the Church authorities.  We see no harm that could come from its publication in that way, but concede that it might do considerable good.     J Jaques. C. W.

Diamond and George Fraxer, or Richfield, appealed from Sevier Stake High Council, we would respectfully report that we conclude that the decision of the High Council was in accordance with the preponderance of the testi- mony taken and that the ends of justice ap- parently have been reached; also that the ques- tion involved being only of a few dollars, and twelve years having elapsed since the High Council decision was given, and the president of the Council having passed away and some of the members having been changed, it would be unprofitable to reopen the case.   recommend that the decision of the High Council be affirmed and enforced.

Foxall Palmer and Grantsville, on appeal from Tooele Stake High Council, we find it difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion, unless we have an idea of the approximate amount of property which Brother Palmer has.   President Tooele City, written to, asking him for a list of the property Brother Palmer holds, real and personal, so far as it can be ascertained with reasonable effort.  We should also like to know the respective ages of Brother Palmer's children by his several wives, in order that we may be the better enabled to render  a just judgment in the case.     Moses Thatcher Seymour B Young John Jaques ENDENTRY    Joseph F. Smith.   Olsen and Logan, on appeal from the Cache Stake High Council, we find that the evidence presented appears to us to justify the decision of the Council. Although Sister Olsen claimed that she was willing to give a mortgage on the property in question as soon as she received the abstract, yet she still refused, even when her own attorney advised her to give it. We therefore respectfully recommend that the decision of the High  Council be affirmed.   only five members of the High Council proper were present, whereas the Book of Covenants states that seven should be present. But, as neither of the parties before the Council in this case took any exceptions or objected to these facts, our remarks in this connec- tion have a bearing more upon future cases.       Moses Thatcher Seymour B Young John Jaques ENDENTRY      ments presented in the case of Brothers Silas S. Smith and J. P. Haynie, appealed from the High Council of San Luis Stake. It appears that several years ago Silas S. Smith, as a silent and equal partner, put $1000 into the store of Downey and Haynie, of Manassa, the said Downey and Haynie having previously invested an equal amount cash therein. The store proved to be not a success, said to be largely owing to giving too much credit, and S. S. Smith wanted his $1000 back with interest, the other two partners, Downey and Haynie, having drawn amounts from the stores equal to their shares in it, and Smith not having drawn anything. The case, by agreement, went before three arbitrators, and also before the High Council, which accepted and adopted the decision of the arbitrators, which decision, as we understand it, was, briefly, That the total amount due S. S. Smith should be held at $1,600, with six per cent per annum interest from date of decision until paid, the whole to be paid out of the assets of the Company, and not out of the personal or private property of either Haynie or Downey, and that J.P. Haynie be placed in possession of said company's property for the payment of said obligation. This appears to us to be an equitable decision, and we therefore respectfully recommend the affirmation of the decision of the High Council, with the under- standing of it as here presented.

Smith.   against Bishop James Wrathall, appealed from the High  Council of the Tooele Stake, it appears that Brothers Parkin- son and Wrathall and others had sheep in a joint herd,  which diminished and eventually was broken up, partly  from neglect of the herdsman.  Brother Wrathall went  to the herd, claimed and sold the sheep, appropriating  them all as his share and then they were insufficient to  fully satisfy his claim.  On Brother Parkinson's complaint  the case was tried by Bishop Atkin of the Tooele Ward. Brother Wrathall appealed from the decision of the Bishop's  court to the High Council of Tooele Stake, which heard the  case, and President H. L. Gowans decided that Brother  Parkinson was entitled to his prorata of the number of  sheep when sold, amounting to 95, and that as  Brother Wrathall had looked after the sheep and effected  the sale of them no interest on their value from the time of  sale should be required of him.  This decision was not  sustained by the ^High^ Councillors, the vote being 6 and 6. The High Council reheard the case and decided that Bro- ther Wrathall pay Brother Parkinson 74 sheep at $2 head, without interest, to be delivered in 90 days at Grants- ville.  Brother Parkinson thought he ought to have  more sheep, and rental or interest on their value from  the time of sale.  As no evidence appears to have  ENDENTRY  been taken at the rehearing by the High Council, we do not see  on what grounds the Council reduced the number of sheep  to be paid from 95 to 74, nor why they came to render a  decision differing from that made at the first hearing.  On the  contrary, it seems to us that President Gowan's decision  at the first sitting of the High Council should be accepted,  in accordance with Doc. &amp; Cov., Sec. 102, pars. 21&amp;22.  As  that decision appears to us to have been an equitable one,  we recommend that it be affirmed.   F. D.

Thorn and Green, or be disfellowshipped.   Sister Mayhew appealed to the Utah Stake, which sus- tained the decision of the lower court.   Mayhew failed to furnish satisfactory proof of their damaging  statements concerning Brothers Thorn &amp; Green, and consequently  were in the wrong in circulating such statements, we therefore  can come to no other conclusion than to affirm the decision  of the High Council, which we respectfully recommend.

Foxall became second wife of James Palmer 43 years ago,  and has had eleven children by him, nine of them now  living, the youngest 20 years old. Brother and Sister  Palmer, not agreeing, have not lived together for about  15 years.  His first wife is dead.  He has a third  wife, Mary Jane Ewer, with whom he lives, and who has  had by him 13 children, 10 of them now living with him,  the youngest about four years old.   and children have not had support from Brother  Palmer for 14 years.  They used to live with him in  Skull Valley, on a farm, which he sold several years  ago for $9,000, part cash and part real estate, and  he thinks he ought to give her and her children part  of that means.   the decision of the Bishop's Court of Grantsville Ward,  to the effect that Brother James Palmer pay Elizabeth  Foxall Palmer certain five acres of land and $1000 in cash, or $1500 in cash without the land, the land to be deeded to her by Nov. 1, 1894, and the cash to be paid  to her by Sept. 1, 1894.   the case presented to us, we respectfully recommend  ENDENTRY  the modification that the land be deeded to her within a  reasonable specified time, and, (as times are hard),  cash difficult to be obtained, and Brother Palmer being 74 year old and having a large young family on his hands) that he be allowed four years in which  to pay the $1000 cash, at the rate of $250 per annum without interest, and that Bishop James L. Wrath all, of Grantsville Ward, be requied to make arrange- ments to secure payment of the same to Elizabeth  J. Palmer, and that Brother Palmer give security for said payments.   F.D. Richards, R. J. Burton Seymour B. Young  John Jaques  ENDENTRY  To President Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, &amp; Joseph F. Smith.   considered the case of Alexander Black and  W. Henry Hurst against James Lees, appealed  from the High Council of Summit Stake.   Lees all had made some improvements on a piece  of R. R. land, and Brothers Black and Hurst had  used, cultivated, and claimed it for years and  before it was in the market, but that Brother  Lees eventually bought the land of the R. R. Com- pany and secured the title thereto. Brothers  Black and Hurst, if they could not get any of the  land, wished to be reimbursed for their claims, water right, and improvements, and various  offers and attempts at adjustment were made,  but without success. Finally Brother Lees  required Brothers Black and Hurst to take away  their moveable improvements (stables, corrals, &amp; c.) within 20 days or forfeit them. The case was  not tried by the Bishop's Court of Coalville East Ward,  because one of the Bishop's Councillors was related  to Brother Lees, and, to avoid prejudicing the  case, it went to the High Council of the Stake,  whose decision was adverse to Brother Lees, and  a committee of three was appointed by the High ENDENTRY  and examine the improvements of the parties, and  award damages.  The Committee reported that  Brother Hurst was entitled to damages amounting to  $33 The report of the Committee was accepted by the High  Council, and approved.

Since you went away we have had all kinds of time and some very warm I assure you Es Rigdon came out decidedly opposed to the Twelve and declares himself above them and not responsible.  He held secret meetings at Sobys night after night and there ordained a number of men prophets, priests and kings without any ordinances or authority.  He likewise taught them that Joseph was fallen and that the Twelve were corrupt and wicked, engaged in Bogus making and adultery &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c.  Ths you may thnk cause a little rupture because in spite of his curring it leaked out and although he told the people in publick that Joseph died holding the keys of authority he taught them in private that Joseph was a fallen prophet and he had known it for years. He said in publisk that he did not want to divide the church,  but in private he said he wanted to feel in the minds of the people  and if he could gain enough to go with him he should come out publickly against the Twelve and rout them.  When these things were proven to the Twelve some of them sent to see him and finally got a confession from him which satisfied them that the reports  were true.  The consequence was he was cited to appear before the High Council in publick meeting for trial, but he refused to come.  The whole case was investigated and a black catalogue of accusations substantiated against him, and he was cut off from the church and delivered over to the buffettings of Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.  There are a number gone with Es.   ENDENTRY  William Richards from New Jersey, George Morey, Joseph H.

We sent word to the Governor  and on the day the Wolf hunt was to take place he was in Nauvoo at the head of about 500 men to prevent the movements  of the mobs.  The Governor has made great pretence to  the Laws and has repeatedly pledged himself to execute them and have the murderers arrested.  The Sheriff went to Warsaw and arrested Sharp but the citizens rescued him.  The Governor then gave them to understand that he  should have them any how and they finally concluded to give themselves up.  Sharp and Williams and the great rascal of a Joseph H.

The object in bringing Brothers Crosby and Freeman was to give us an opportunity to learn from them concerning the trial before the Bishop's Court and before the High Council.  After hearing all that was said upon the subject, and espe- cially from Brother Milner concerning his rot having been properly notified, and his willingness to agree to that which was reasonable to make satisfac- tion, we promised him to write to you.  The assurance that Brother Freeman gave concerning the willingness of the brethren to pay it themselves rather than have any trouble, prompted us to exhort Brother Milner to seek an early settlement, as we believed from the spirit that Brother Freeman described as existing among the Saints who are interested in this case, that it would not be a difficult matter for Brother Milner to make affairs right if he had the disposition he should have, as a Latter-day Saint.   very well be judged by the standard which we expect other men to be measured ENDENTRY  his standing in the Church; and while we do not think it would be proper to submit to wrong from him, still if you can meet him in the spirit of con- cession no doubt it will have the effect to save him from serious difficulty in connection with his standing in the Church.

Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY    Salt Lake City, U.T.        Shorthly after the last general conference in this city we had one or two interviews with John B. Milner at which Brother Freeman and Brother Crosby of your stake were present; and we became satisfied from all that was said that there had been irregularities in the trial of the case of John B. Milner before the Bishop's court and before the High Council though we did not say so to him. Brother Freeman heard all the conversation and understood its purport, also Brother Crosby - if he is with you still.. We have received the enclosed papers from John B. Milner concerning this case, and we send them to you for your considereation. John B. Milner is a very peculiar man; he has oddities of manner and in his way of doing business that create unfavorable impressions concerning his soundness; but we believe that underlying these peculiarities he has a strong love for the Gospel and values his connection with the people very highly. We do not know why he should have been published as excommunicated as this is not the general custom, and there are many cases more flagrant than his that are no published.

ENDENTRY  Salt Lake City, Utah,        Respecting a new Bishop for the Heber Ward, it will be well for yourself and Counselors and the High Council to canvass the names of the brethren most suitable and seek for the mind of the Spirit, so that you may decide upon someone to fill this position. When you have thus decided, you can send the name to me, or if one of the Twelve should visit there soon--which we expect will be the case--you can submit your decision to him, and iffacceptable to the people he can be ordained to that position.   ENDENTRY        ENDENTRY  The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints    TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES,   decision which was reached at our last April Conference upon the sub- ject of making allowances to different officers of the Church for ser- vices, affairs have been in an unsettled condition, and there has been uncertainty prevailing upon the subject of drawing from the Church any compensation for services rendered.  As was explained on that occasion, it was not the design to deprive the brethren who are laboring in various capacition and spending more or less of their time in the public service, of some compensation.  The design was to prevent the growth of a feeling that certain officers in the Church were to receive a certain amount.  We all felt that it was not a wise thing - in fact, that it was contrary to the purpose of the Almighty - that the minis- ters of His Church should receive fixed sums as salaries.  And it was pleasing to us to see the manner in which our views upon this question were received by the assembled brethren.   Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors? Shall we allow them the same amounts that we did formerly? Or what amounts shall we allow them?   dent of Stake and his Counselors get together, and, knowing each other's circumstances, decide what amount they think would be proper under the circumstances for each of them to receive; with the under- standing, however, that the aggregate amount shall not exceed the amount heretofore allowed.  There may be members of the different Presidencies of Stakes who may be in circumstances where they need but little, if anything, from Church funds to help sustain them, and who would take pride in rendering their services gratuitously to the Church.  Some of these may be Presidents, and some Counselors.  On the other hand, there may be some Presidents and some Counselors who are in circumstances which require that they should receive some compensation for their services.  Each President with his Counselors can decide this and forward the statement to the office of the First Presidency.  By doing this we think that the purpose we had in view in our counsel to the Priesthood at the April Conference will be carried out.

Now, brethren; with the exception of summing  up and adding a few new names, I have simply  stated what has been stated before, and I hope no  harm has been done, but that good will result there from.  By way of further explanation I beg leave to  say that the article was published before I knew any thing of a Constitutional Convention coming of, or I  would perhaps have had judgment enough to postpone  publication at present, or at least referred the matter  to you before printing.

BOX 1678. Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 1, 1897 President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother!   Angus M. Cannon called on me and brought  a special and direct message from you to  the effecct that you desired me to give  to L. P. Neve a deed to some property  which I own in Mill Creek, and which  said Neve has been suing me for in  court.  Immediately upon receiving your  message, I want to my attorney, Bro. Franklin L. Richards, and instructed him  to hand over the deed which had  already been executed.  And L. P. Neve  will be notified by me personally to-day  that Bro. Richards will give him the  deed on his payment of some tax  money and a portion of the court  expenses.  The property in question is worth  about $5000 (it cost me more than that), and is the same property to which I executed  a deed to the trustee-in-trust, about  1 1/2 years ago, which deed could not then be  ENDENTRY  obtained   understand the case (though I have not  mentioned the matter to you myself) and that  you had good reasons for making the request. Of course everything I have is on the altar, according to covenants which I have made; and I feel to bow in obedience to your  request, though I must confess that under  existing circumstances, I cannot think of a  person that I would not rather give my  property to than L. P. Neve.   a false light before you, I will state that  I have already made up my mind to give  up the property, according to a most unjust  decision of a court, and was only waiting  for the adjustment, by my attorney, of some  miner matters connected with it.  But  I had not looked for a request from  the president of the Church to do so.   you, I remain Your Brother in the Gospel, Andrew Jenson   to this by G J Gibbs, about one &amp;  a half hours after it was brought to the office by himself,  &amp; was informed by Bro Gibbs that Pres.

I have not asked the Church to bear my traveling expenses so far, nor do I desire to ask for that to be done in the future, as long, as I can possibly defray them myself; but ENDENTRY  it would not be proper to allow me some credit on tithing.  I am behind in my tithing this year, and also for last year, and having spent the means which should have gone to the tithing office as stated, I would be pleased to have an entry made to my credit on this year's account, if it can be done done consistantly If not, I desire to pay my tithing any way, as I am a believer in the principle, and want my record on earth as complete as possible in this regard, as well as in other respects.   and your Counselors with heaven's richest blessings, and that you during this inclement part of the season may be preserved in the enjoyment of good health, I remain       Dec. 18 '94 ENDENTRY            by Charles M.

Dear Brethren:-   a series of tracts for missionary purposes, as suggested by the  brethren in charge of the British Mission, I have written twelve  tracts which I believe will meet the neccessities of the times in  that particular.  After entering upon the work I thought it better  to continue and complete the series uniformly, than to cull from other pamphlets or to mix in other tracts.  This set will make a  series of twelve tracts of four pages each, and will introduce the  First Principles of the Gospel, the Apostacy, the Restoration, the  Authority of the Priesthood, the Book of Mormon, Baptism for the  Dead, the Establishment of Zion, the Work Performed by the Saints  in Utah, etc., in consec^u^tive order, one tract leading up to those  succeeding.  I believe they will be found suitable for distribution  in any of the Missions.  I hold them at your disposal, and if you  see fit to refer them to any person or committee for review, I shall  be pleased to submit them, and assist in their inspection if you so  desire.   C. W. Penrose ENDENTRY              with my short interview- with you on Tuesday, especially in reference to the subject of Temperance you kindly called up for remarks.  I listened attentively to the position taken by Bro Joseph F. Smith, and since then, having had some reflections bearing on the same, will you kindly bear with me while I express them and give them that consideration their importance deserves.   Wisdom, would there be any impropriety for him to submit a simple test with a view of finding out how many of his congregation were brought under conviction, and were ENDENTRY  signing their resources to an obligation, promising to abstain from the use of Tea, Coffee, Cigarettes, Tobacco,  and the use of meats, only in moderation. Some of all ages would sign such a pledge in every congregation, a card of membership should then be given them, and their names entered in a book,called,say  Another appeal should then be made to the same congregation for those to sign another pledge, promising to abstain from the use of "Tobacco and Strong drink," a card should be given to them as members  of No 2 Division, of the Latter day Saint Temperance Society.  When that is done, ask all the members of both division to arise and I venture an assertion that in many instances the great majority of the congregation would arise. I cannot imagine any other effort that could be made, that would lead to such ENDENTRY    simply a farce, and the thousands of professing Latter day saints, whose daily habits of life, being in direct antago -nism to the Word and Will of the Lord, certainly calls aloud for some mighty effort, to stem this torrent of iniquity.
