 Millville Jan. 31, 1898.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City.    Dear Bro:    Elder Alma Larsen  of this Ward was to have  left Salt Lake City to fill  a mission in Scandinavia  on the 5th of Feb.    He has been quite if ill  for some time, while we   are pleased to say he is  recovering still we do not  think he is in a fit  condition to start on that  date. Therefore hope you will  excuse him for the present  and as soon as he recovers he will  report to you. Your Bro. John E. Roueche Bp.  of Millville

 the message    Lord of Hosts.    Behold; there are many people seeking after  me, who are unable to find me because of the  confusion which prevails in consequence of   the false teachings of the church and of the   governments of the world: Therefore I command  you to let the truth go forth from Zion,  and let your light shine forth a beacon to   guide the wanderers to the land of their in-  heritance, in order that they may become  established for all eternity.    Behold, the time is at hand when all   things shall be made new. Already the   people are organized for social regeneration.  Already the armies are marshalling for the  Armageddon battle: Wherefore put on  thy strength O Zion, and assume the autho-  rity of the Priesthood, which is yours by  right Divine. Lose from your necks the  bands which enthrall you and command  the nations to returns to the Lord whence

 Ephraim April 18th 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff!  Salt Lake City    Beloved Brother!    Your letter of April 7th inst. was  recieved by my family while I was in Salt Lake  City attending conference, but they sent it to me  and, in [needing] the suggestion, and also re[f]lection  for me to take a mission to the "Northern States" or  (Chicago) will say: as to my feelings regarding this  call; that I am perfectly willing to accept the  same; but as I just returned from said mission  about 4 months ago, I would wish a short extend-  ing of time, to make a few arrangements at home,  and also do I have an idea, of obtaining a favor  regarding my railroad fare from the R Y officials,  the reason for which, is well known to Elders Geo.  Reynolds, and W. C. Spence, as also President C. D. Fjeld-  sted. I did see Mr Walker while in the city  and he also promised to work in my favor, so  perhaps through the united effort, by all concerned  I could get a preveliged pass; whereby I could go  without being obliged to fall back to heavely on my  family and friends for assistance. I injoyed my labors  very much the 19 months I was in Chicago, and    over

Verily I say unto you, put on the authori-  ty of the Priesthood; Arise and shine  forth, that your light may be a standard  for the nations; And let the gathering to-  gether upon the land of Zion, be for a   defence and refuge from the storm, and  from wrath, when it shall be poured out  without mixture upon the whole earth.   Be strong from henceforth and fear not,  for the Kingdom is yours: The days of your  humiliations are past; Saith the Lord your   God: Wherefore hear my voice and do all  things as I command you.    But Verily, you must ordain my law and  practice it in all things, and I will be your  King, saith the Lord your God.

 Conclusion    I have nothing more to add exept that I am  extreemly sorry that I cannot deliver this message  by word of mouth. I have not the means to  pay my way for such a tripâ€” neither am   I allowed to inform the Saints here of the  messageâ€”since its import must emi-  nate from Zion. Therfore I shall bury  the secret within my own heart until  such time as you shall unseal my lips.   I will forward this message in a regis-  tered package, and the Lord will see   to it that it comes safely into your hands.    Asking your blessing, and promising  fealty on my part, I remain your  fellow servant of our Lord, the Most  High God. Amen.    In fellowshipâ€”  Charles F. Keller.  247. E.

Having yet no way to ob-  tain support after reaching   the Scandinavian Mission,  which I am informed is very   expensive, my Bishop has  advised me to ask for a   transfere to the Southern States,  where I may labor without   means.    Thinking that a statement   of my conditions might be   of value, I will offer the fol-  lowing information.    Was born on norther Nor-  way, and came to Utah at   the age of eight. Can read  and speak the la Norwegian  language tolerably. Am   now twenty eight, and un-  married, and am only on   a level, financially. Took a   Homestead Entery, in Fremont Co.,  Idaho about three year ago,   but on account of my mis-  sionary call, have felt dis-  contented, and have not  prospered, and of late, have  not complied with the law  in the same, intending to   give it up, and perform   my mission,    I would like to labor   in my native land, if   it were ^or if it is^ possible to do so

 Mayfield, May 13, 1898.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother:    Last July I promiced to take  a mission to the Southern States on or before  July next. The principal reason that I  asked for a year was to cure myself of a secret  disease, spermatorreah. The cause of the di-  seas was, I think, the discontinueation of work  and going to school.    I still have it, not bad, but worse than  I feel safe with. I am strong, active  and hearty. Sound in mind and body  I think. I am twenty-four years old and  unmarried.    I hated to speak of this, but thought it   necessary. I would not like for the people of  town to know it. I have consulted a doctor.    I am now at your disposal. I thought  that it would be better for me not to go just yet.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Heber Larson.    See over.

Dear Brother:    About a year ago I received a  letter from the Missionary Committee inquiring  if it would be consistent with my feelings and  circumstances to take a mission. I replied that it  would be a pleasure to me to respond to any call made  of me t[h]rough the Priesthood, but that I had a   mail contract which would not be completed until  July of this year. I then received another, requesting  me to report to you whenever I found myself in a  position to respond to a call to preach the gospel.    In compliance with which, I now take the  liberty to report that I shall be through withe   my mail contract on July 1st next. It will take me  some little timeâ€”probably a month or six weeks after thatâ€”  to finish up my business; And then if my services are  need^ed^ I shall hold my self subject to your call.    I spoke to Elder John Henry Smith on the subject when  he was here recently.    Very truly, Your brother,  Joseph W. Smith.    That will be all right. J. F. S.
