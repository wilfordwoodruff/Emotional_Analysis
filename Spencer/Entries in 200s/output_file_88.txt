Salt Lake City, July 8, 1897. To The First Presidency. Dear Brethren:- The Mss sent to the Historian's office prepared by Elder E. H. Nye, Prsident of the California Mission, has been carefully examined. While it contains many good points on the first principles of the Gospel, it appears to be too voluminous for popular use as a tract. If the various subjects it treats of were presented under the separate headings it contains, it would perhaps be better adapted for circu- lation, but even in that case the matter would have to be re-written. As there are now in print many tracts treating on the subjects con- tained in the MSS, the necessity for publishing it does not appear imperative.  In any event careful revision and much labor would be  required before it would be suitable for publication.  All of which  is respectfully submitted.  Your brother in the Gospel,  (signature of F. D Richards) ENDENTRY May 6 1898  To the First Presidency  Dear Brethren  We, you committee, appointed  to examine the papers in the appeal of  Brother Nathan Tanner Jr from a decision of the High Council of the Weber Stake of Zion, having very carefully and thorough- ly examined and considered all the papers in the case presented to us, hereby respect- fully report as follows, to wit:  The decision of the High Council appears to be fully justified by the evidence.  1st It is clear from the testimony, as well as the statements of both the accuser and accused, that Nathan Tanner Jr. owes and should pay to Annie Pingree Tanner, his divorced wife, the sum of $12500  2nd The second charge in the complaint was properly dismissed, the amount of $20 00 claimed by the accuser having been  paid to her father ENDENTRY 3rd the accused is under moral and re- ligious obligation to provide a home and support for his divorced wife and the three children which are his, and that this may be secured to them he should deed to Annie Pingree Tanner, in trust for those three children, the home they now occupy or some equally suitable property, and fur- nish them a milch cow with feed and the sum of four dollars per week in money. With the proviso that this may be modified as decided by the High Council. The only differences in these terms of the decision and those admitted to be proper by the accused are these: He thinks that $2 50 per week a sufficient cash amount for a woman and three children, and the Council decide that $4 per week is the proper amount considering the circumstances of all the parties. Also he objects to deeding any property for the support of his children, claiming that he wants the ENDENTRY place himself and is able and willing to care for them; while the Council decide that the children shall be secured in a home under the care of their mother, and in case of any change in the conditions, requiring a change in the terms of the decision, the matter shall be determined by arbitration in the manner provided by that decision. The other part of the family of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr. have been provided for, it appears, by the property deeded to their mother  4 th As it is evident from the admissions and explanations of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr that he did obtain and furnish to his wife Annie an instrument to prevent conception and request her to use it for that purpose, the requirement of the Council that he ask her forgiveness for doing so seems very proper and a merciful disposition of the matter. ENDENTRY In reference to the doubt cast upon the pa- ternity of one of the children by Bro. Nathan Tanner Jr, the evidence does not bear out the insinuation in any particular, but shows that Bro. Tanner's effort to prevent further conception, and the birth of the third child, occurred after the alleged improper con- duct of his wife Annie, and that he there- fore condoned the offence if any there were  We find nothing in the papers submitted to us which justifies the severe and violent charges against Bishop R.

Dear Brethren:-  About the time that Elder Europe,  he called at my office, informed me of his intended departure, and stated that it had been his habit while previously in London to attend meetings and speak, and had administered baptism, and he desired to  do what good he could while away. He said it had been suggested that he call at the President's office, but they had all left for the night,  and that he must go that night, or by the early forning train, and  wanted to get the letter now; said he had been recommended by Brother  Smith to do so. (I understood him to mean President Jos. F. Smith).  I then asked him for his recommend from his Bishop. He replied, "I am a Bishop's Counselor, and have a right to sign recommends in the absence of the Bishop, myself". I thereupon issued a regular letter of appointment to him as a missionary, bearing date of that day,  as ever,  Your fellow laborer in Zion,  F.D. Richards. ENDENTRY 56  Salt Lake City, June   , 1896.  Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F. Smith. Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-  It is with great reluctance that I  feel constrained to ask you for assistance to enable me to dischare my obligations financially, which have been accumulating upon me for a number of years past, during the rail and hard times that attended and followed thereupon.  This indebtedness, which now amounts to $575000./ has not accrued through any misadventure of speculation or trade, but has come about by the continuous necessary expenses of myself and the dependant por- tions of my families. I have not expended one dollar in mining, nor have I received a dollar from any mining interest.  During the period while Government was plundering the Church, I felt to bear my own burden, as all around me seemed to have all they could carry, and I have patiently hoped against hope, until by the good providence of God, the Government has restored, and agreed to restore, all Church property, real and personal, to its rightful possessor.  I was gratified that it was deemed advisable to relieve my breth- ren of the Cannon and Grant Company, and I hope it may be found per- missable to afford me the relief which I now ask, and very much need, to enable me to stop paying interest, and deliver me from financial ENDENTRY 57  -:2:-  embarrassment, so that I may preserve my credit and pursue my labors with a pleasure and delight, which I cannot otherwise do.  My Bishop credits me with paying a full tithing; and my full quoto of offering to finish the Temple.  I have donated fairly to the Tabernacle, our new Second Ward Hall, Feat-day offerings, besides many others for the poor.  Meanwhile I have observed as rigid economy in my personal and family expenditures as I thought consistent with my station in life.  If not too tedious, I might allude to the fact that in the midst of my life, while I had the care of Dr. Willard Richards', as well as my own large families, I had years of distressing sickness to contend with.  The loss of what little I had by Indians in the Tintic War, which with the duties of the ministry, prevented me from establishing myself in business as some of my brethren have been able to do, and today I have neither Farm, Flock, Herd, or any permanent business from which to derive any regular income.  But now that my family have become able, most of them, to help themselves, I trust that with the aid herein ask- ed, I may keep my expenses within the available income at present allowed.  While I wish to give all needed information of my circumstances, I desire no needless publicity of them, and shall feel exceedingly thankful for the assistance herein asked.  If I may receive one half of the amount named soon, and the other  in three months, I believe I shall be able to satisfy the most urgent of my creditors- Yours Faithfully F. D. Richards.

The length of the treatise has required considerable time for proper inspection, and is herewith returned.  The Mss. on "Preaching and How to Preach", consists of 715 small pages, divided into more than 100 divisions and sub-divisions, and has besides 500 and odd marginal indices.  The following are a few of the captions, etc., over the subjects discussed:  "Is there a need for this book?" "Parable of the sacred tree". "Ought preaching to be made a formal study among Latter Day Saints?" Answered affirmatively. "Preaching no more divine than digging canals". "The fosselized Elder and his sermon". "The brain forming process". "The Goodish Preacher". "The Melody of a Sermon". "As a people we are evidently in love with gliettering generalities" ""The cow in the bovine paradise". Specific and not general statements urged. "Still grubbing among things earthly". "Scope and range of subjects". "The need of profound study". "The art of thinking". ENDENTRY "Founding of ideas". "How to chew and digest what we read". "Etymology of the words "apperception and Apperceptive". "Need of imagery and illustration". "The mind must be a complete court". "Importance of choosing a subject before beginning to speak". "Value of a single subject", urged. "Only such subjects should be chosen as are interesting to ^the^ speaker". "Make a mental analysis of your audience". "Triteness and indefainiteness". "Sermons that have departed this life". "We must prepare for preaching". "A much needed revolution". "What missionary sermons should be like". "The need of adopting more popular methods in preaching". "The real value of the doctrinal sermon,- the topical sermon". "Importance of a plot". "Principles and methods of argumentation". "The conduct of a discussion". "Need of persicuity". "How to arouse emotion". "Qualifications of an orator". "Sermons should at least have a beginning (introduction). Middle (discussion), and ending conclusion". "Managing the emotions". "A discourse should contain but one hour's talk". "The need, value and importance of dividing a sermon". "The need of studying grammar". "Preaching as an art". "Formal preaching". "We should be exact, clear and constructive in our sermons". "What becomes of the teacher that does not form the habit of thinking clearly and consectively?" "Rhetoric, elocution, and kindred studies"should be cultivated". "Preaching will be made a study, both as to subject matter and method of delivery, just as ( school ) teaching has already been, and equally good results may be expected". "We should study how to preach". "The Elder speaks from the fullness or emptiness of his own head".  "The relative value of oral and written sermons". ENDENTRY "The low ebb to which our preaching has sunk, is owing to the oral impromptu or unstudied methods which have obtained favor among the Latter Day Saints". "Sermons based on the nature of the congregation.  The age and general intelligence of the hearers must be taken into acct". "Debates and discussions urged, and how they should be conducted". "Sermons abroad and at home". Oratory and kindred qualification, "etc. "Sermons should be made up of logical and progressive thought". etc., ad libitum.  If the author of the work were a student of some modern sectarian Theological Seminary, its contents would not, perhaps, ex- cite much comment.  The work is scholarly and exhaustive; but while the author in- sists that his arguments are in strict harmony with quotations on the subject of preaching and how to preach the Gospel, taken from standard sources, the Mss. in its explicit and general tenor inculcates theories and urges upon its readers suggestions, propositions and methods al- together at variance with the plain intent and meaning of those standards. Nevertheless it contains a number of wholesome and seasonable suggestions, well worthy the consideration of thoughtful and prayerful Elders.  Yet, after all, there is nothing in the teachings of the Savior and his Apostles, ancient or modern, in support of the  methods and disipline urged by the author.  After a careful review of the Mss, we are of the opinion that it would not be a suitable work to publish as a guide to preaching, for the Elders of the church, who are commended to speak that which is given them by the spirit, when it becomes their duty to preach and teach.  sideways text Respectfully submitted F.D.Richards Historian and c. end of sideways text ENDENTRY 115  Salt Lake City, August 7, 1896.  To The First Presidency:- Dear Brethren:-  The propositions of L. A. Wilson in reference to the recording of genealogies and work performed by individuals in behalf of the dead, have been duly considered by the Church Historian and his assistants and by a majority of the Directors of the Genealogical Society, and their unanimous decision is, that it is inexpedient to entrust a work of such magnitude and importance as that proposed, to one person or to any private agency, Nor does it appear from the docu- ments submitted that the evils complained of would be remedied by the  scheme proposed.  It would seem more in keeping with the order of the Church and of Temple Work to place this matter under the supervision of the Temple Recorders and Presidents.  Very respectfully,  F. D. Richards-  Church Historian, and President of the Genealogical Society of Utah ENDENTRY 306  Salt Lake City, Sept. 1, 1897.  To the First Presidency, Dear Brethren:-  Having read and scrutinized the Ms. of a work  entitled "Children of God", by Brother Brigham City, according to your request, we beg to report as follows:  We find no special objection to the story or to the doc- trinal points with which it treats; the style of the work exhi- bits much taste and literary ability, and the descriptive matter is striking and attractive.  Yet we would not recommend the en- dorsement of the authorities of the Church in its publication, as that would make the Church, to some extent at least, responsible for its theories, and might be used to urge the sale of the book in a way that would not be desirable.  We are of the opinion that permission might be given to the author to publish the work on his own responsibility, without the seal of sanction from the Church authorities.  We see no harm that could come from its publication in that way, but concede that it might do considerable good.  Respectfully, your brethren,  F. D. Richards. J Jaques. C. W.

Dear Brethren:-  According to your instructions, we have carefully read  and considered the Manuscript by Elder Samuel G. Spencer, and hereby respectfully report, that while it is lengthy for a pamphlet designed for general circulation, making probably about fifty pages of ordinary size, it is yet a fair epitome of the doctrines and organization of the Church, with the history of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the Scriptural predictions concerning it, all fortified by very numerous quotations from the Old and New Testaments, and likely to be productive of good, by meeting objections raised against the latter day work.  If it is published, it should be carefully revised for the press, additional sub-headings interpolated, and some expressions modi- fied.  In going over the Manuscript, some suggestions of this kind we have marked upon it.  The writer has borrowed copiously in the latter part of the work from the writings of Orson Pratt, but they are made to harmonize with the other parts of the work.  We do not think it would be advisable for the Church to issue the ENDENTRY :-2:-  pamphlet as one of its Standards, but if the Northern States Mission were to print it, no doubt it would be of value as an aid to missionary labors.

Dear Brethren:-  In accordance with your wishes, I have heard Elder David W. Patten read, in company with Elders A. M. Musser, and we all consider it is an excellent work, and will prove interesting, instructive and edifying to its readers.  We would, however, make the following suggestions, which we think  would be improvements:  Page 4,- "New Movement".  Would not some other expression be better?  Page 8,- "Patriarch Joseph C. Kingsbury".  He was not a Patriarch  then.  Would not the word Elder be better, if any title is given:  Page 9,- "Sent to the honest in heart".  Was he not sent to Preach the Gospel to all who would hear?  Page 10.- "Patriarch Hyrum Smith".  Same as page 8.  Page 11,- "President B. Young".  Same as page 8.

Dear Brethren-  Having considered the case of Jane Diamond and George Fraxer, or Richfield, appealed from Sevier Stake High Council, we would respectfully report that we conclude that the decision of the High Council was in accordance with the preponderance of the testi- mony taken and that the ends of justice ap- parently have been reached; also that the ques- tion involved being only of a few dollars, and twelve years having elapsed since the High Council decision was given, and the president of the Council having passed away and some of the members having been changed, it would be unprofitable to reopen the case.  Therefore your committee unanimously recommend that the decision of the High Council be affirmed and enforced.  F. D. Richards.

Dear Brethren - In the case of Elizabeth Foxall Palmer and Grantsville, on appeal from Tooele Stake High Council, we find it difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion, unless we have an idea of the approximate amount of property which Brother Palmer has.  We therefore respectfully suggest that you have President Tooele City, written to, asking him for a list of the property Brother Palmer holds, real and personal, so far as it can be ascertained with reasonable effort.  We should also like to know the respective ages of Brother Palmer's children by his several wives, in order that we may be the better enabled to render  a just judgment in the case.

Olsen and Logan, on appeal from the Cache Stake High Council, we find that the evidence presented appears to us to justify the decision of the Council. Although Sister Olsen claimed that she was willing to give a mortgage on the property in question as soon as she received the abstract, yet she still refused, even when her own attorney advised her to give it. We therefore respectfully recommend that the decision of the High  Council be affirmed.  We notice in passing that in the hearing of this case only five members of the High Council proper were present, whereas the Book of Covenants states that seven should be present. But, as neither of the parties before the Council in this case took any exceptions or objected to these facts, our remarks in this connec- tion have a bearing more upon future cases.

Dear Brethren, Your Committee have carefully considered the docu- ments presented in the case of Brothers Silas S. Smith and J. P. Haynie, appealed from the High Council of San Luis Stake. It appears that several years ago Silas S. Smith, as a silent and equal partner, put $1000 into the store of Downey and Haynie, of Manassa, the said Downey and Haynie having previously invested an equal amount cash therein. The store proved to be not a success, said to be largely owing to giving too much credit, and S. S. Smith wanted his $1000 back with interest, the other two partners, Downey and Haynie, having drawn amounts from the stores equal to their shares in it, and Smith not having drawn anything. The case, by agreement, went before three arbitrators, and also before the High Council, which accepted and adopted the decision of the arbitrators, which decision, as we understand it, was, briefly, That the total amount due S. S. Smith should be held at $1,600, with six per cent per annum interest from date of decision until paid, the whole to be paid out of the assets of the Company, and not out of the personal or private property of either Haynie or Downey, and that J.P. Haynie be placed in possession of said company's property for the payment of said obligation. This appears to us to be an equitable decision, and we therefore respectfully recommend the affirmation of the decision of the High Council, with the under- standing of it as here presented.

Dear Brethren - your committee, to whom you referred  certain applealed cases from Stake High Councils, for exam- ination and findings, respectfully report the following on  the case between the Bishopric of Farmington and Brother  T.B. Clark.  The record submitted shows that Brother Clark has been  disposed, and has made it his practice, to defame the  reputation of his brethren, and when urged to make  specific charges against those whom he has accused of  various crimes has persistently refused to do so, yet has not  discontinued his slanderous remarks, but has found  fault with the Bishopric for not trying those against  whom he will neither make direct charges nor testify.  While accusing others, his letters, written over an assumed  name, clearly show, in our opinion, the duplicity to which he  descended in his efforts to injure the local authorities of the Farmington Ward.  In view of these findings, we respectfully recommend that the decision  of the Stake High Council be affirmed, and that instructions  be given to have the same enforced.   F. D.

Parkinson  against Bishop James Wrathall, appealed from the High  Council of the Tooele Stake, it appears that Brothers Parkin- son and Wrathall and others had sheep in a joint herd,  which diminished and eventually was broken up, partly  from neglect of the herdsman.  Brother Wrathall went  to the herd, claimed and sold the sheep, appropriating  them all as his share and then they were insufficient to  fully satisfy his claim.  On Brother Parkinson's complaint  the case was tried by Bishop Atkin of the Tooele Ward. Brother Wrathall appealed from the decision of the Bishop's  court to the High Council of Tooele Stake, which heard the  case, and President H. L. Gowans decided that Brother  Parkinson was entitled to his prorata of the number of  sheep when sold, amounting to 95, and that as  Brother Wrathall had looked after the sheep and effected  the sale of them no interest on their value from the time of  sale should be required of him.  This decision was not  sustained by the ^High^ Councillors, the vote being 6 and 6. The High Council reheard the case and decided that Bro- ther Wrathall pay Brother Parkinson 74 sheep at $200 per head, without interest, to be delivered in 90 days at Grants- ville.  Brother Parkinson thought he ought to have  more sheep, and rental or interest on their value from  the time of sale.  As no evidence appears to have  ENDENTRY 2 been taken at the rehearing by the High Council, we do not see  on what grounds the Council reduced the number of sheep  to be paid from 95 to 74, nor why they came to render a  decision differing from that made at the first hearing.  On the  contrary, it seems to us that President Gowan's decision  at the first sitting of the High Council should be accepted,  in accordance with Doc. and Cov., Sec. 102, pars. 21and22.  As  that decision appears to us to have been an equitable one,  we recommend that it be affirmed.  Respectfully your Brethren in the Gospel, F. D.

Dear Brethren - In the case of Bishop Joseph E. Thorn  and Samuel Green, sen., against Sarah  Mayhew, of Pleasant Grove, for slander, on appeal from  the High Council of Utah Stake, Brother and Sister Mayhew  are charged with circulating a statement that Brothers Thorn  and Green deposited a load of wheat in the Pleasant Grove  Tithing Office about 15 years ago, and the same hour, in the  absence of Brother Mayhew, who was the Tithing Office clerk, taking  the wheat out of the office and carrying it away again, which,  though not impossible, was a very unlikely thing, and was  denied by Brothers Thorn and Green.  The case was heard by Bishop American Fork, who decided that the  charge was established, there being lack of evidence of the alleged theft, and that Brother and Sister Mayhew ask forgiveness of Bros.  Thorn and Green, or be disfellowshipped.  Brother and  Sister Mayhew appealed to the Utah Stake, which sus- tained the decision of the lower court.  As Brother and Sister  Mayhew failed to furnish satisfactory proof of their damaging  statements concerning Brothers Thorn and Green, and consequently  were in the wrong in circulating such statements, we therefore  can come to no other conclusion than to affirm the decision  of the High Council, which we respectfully recommend.  Respectfully, Your Brethren in the Gospe, R T Burton John Jaques ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 26, 1895. To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and  Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren - Your committee herewith return the documents in the case of James  Palmer, appealed from the High Council of Tooele Stake  by James Palmer.  It appears that Elizabeth  Foxall became second wife of James Palmer 43 years ago,  and has had eleven children by him, nine of them now  living, the youngest 20 years old. Brother and Sister  Palmer, not agreeing, have not lived together for about  15 years.  His first wife is dead.  He has a third  wife, Mary Jane Ewer, with whom he lives, and who has  had by him 13 children, 10 of them now living with him,  the youngest about four years old.  Elizabeth Palmer  and children have not had support from Brother  Palmer for 14 years.  They used to live with him in  Skull Valley, on a farm, which he sold several years  ago for $9,000, part cash and part real estate, and  he thinks he ought to give her and her children part  of that means.  The High Council approved  the decision of the Bishop's Court of Grantsville Ward,  to the effect that Brother James Palmer pay Elizabeth  Foxall Palmer certain five acres of land and $1000 in cash, or $1500 in cash without the land, the land to be deeded to her by Nov. 1, 1894, and the cash to be paid  to her by Sept. 1, 1894.  After carefully considering the case presented to us, we respectfully recommend  ENDENTRY that the decision of the High Council be affirmed, with the modification that the land be deeded to her within a  reasonable specified time, and, (as times are hard),  cash difficult to be obtained, and Brother Palmer being 74 year old and having a large young family on his hands) that he be allowed four years in which  to pay the $1000 cash, at the rate of $250 per annum without interest, and that Bishop James L. Wrath all, of Grantsville Ward, be requied to make arrange- ments to secure payment of the same to Elizabeth  J. Palmer, and that Brother Palmer give security for said payments.

We find that Brothers Black and Hurst and  Lees all had made some improvements on a piece  of R. R. land, and Brothers Black and Hurst had  used, cultivated, and claimed it for years and  before it was in the market, but that Brother  Lees eventually bought the land of the R. R. Com- pany and secured the title thereto. Brothers  Black and Hurst, if they could not get any of the  land, wished to be reimbursed for their claims, water right, and improvements, and various  offers and attempts at adjustment were made,  but without success. Finally Brother Lees  required Brothers Black and Hurst to take away  their moveable improvements (stables, corrals, and c.) within 20 days or forfeit them. The case was  not tried by the Bishop's Court of Coalville East Ward,  because one of the Bishop's Councillors was related  to Brother Lees, and, to avoid prejudicing the  case, it went to the High Council of the Stake,  whose decision was adverse to Brother Lees, and  a committee of three was appointed by the High ENDENTRY Council to visit the premises, investigate the claims  and examine the improvements of the parties, and  award damages.  The Committee reported that  Brother Hurst was entitled to damages amounting to  $3350, and Brother Black to $7700, from Brother Lees. The report of the Committee was accepted by the High  Council, and approved.  Brother Lees appealed  from the decision of the High Council.  We consider that Brothers Black and Hurst were  entitled to some compensation, and that the amounts  stated above are a moderate estimate for damages  sustained by them, and therefore that the decision of the High Council was fair and equitable. Consequently we respectfully recommend that the  aforesaid decision be affirmed.  Your brethren in the Gospel, F. D.

Dear Brethren - Your Committee have considered  the case of James V. Williams and T. L. Quist, appealed  from the High Council of Sevier Stake.  This is a  question, not of title to land, that not being in  dispute, but of value for prior claims, water right,  and improvements by Brother Quist, and in part  conceded by Brother Williams, to and on a city  lot in Monroe.  The High Council approved  the decision of the Bishop's Court of Monroe Ward, which was briefly that Brother Williams accept  $50 from Brother Quist, and give him deed for the  lot, or pay Brother Quist $125 within six months, and  keep the lot, water-right, and improvements.

Since you went away we have had all kinds of time and some very warm I assure you Es Rigdon came out decidedly opposed to the Twelve and declares himself above them and not responsible.  He held secret meetings at Sobys night after night and there ordained a number of men prophets, priests and kings without any ordinances or authority.  He likewise taught them that Joseph was fallen and that the Twelve were corrupt and wicked, engaged in Bogus making and adultery andc andc. andc.  Ths you may thnk cause a little rupture because in spite of his curring it leaked out and although he told the people in publick that Joseph died holding the keys of authority he taught them in private that Joseph was a fallen prophet and he had known it for years. He said in publisk that he did not want to divide the church,  but in private he said he wanted to feel in the minds of the people  and if he could gain enough to go with him he should come out publickly against the Twelve and rout them.  When these things were proven to the Twelve some of them sent to see him and finally got a confession from him which satisfied them that the reports  were true.  The consequence was he was cited to appear before the High Council in publick meeting for trial, but he refused to come.  The whole case was investigated and a black catalogue of accusations substantiated against him, and he was cut off from the church and delivered over to the buffettings of Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.  There are a number gone with Es.  Rigdon to "the mountains" as he said as to Pittsburgh ENDENTRY Amongst those who have gone with him are John A. Forgeus,  William Richards from New Jersey, George Morey, Joseph H.  Newton, Leonard Soby, Samuel Bennett; Wm" Cottier, George N. Crouse and several others who had scattered agreeable to the fundamental principles of Er Rigdons doctrine.  Jared Carter was  cut off with these but he has made a full confession and was  voted to be rebaptised.  The above men even all cut off, by the  unanimous vote of a large congregation of Saints.  James Emmett has drawn off a party and gone somewhere west but I dont know where.  There are but few gone with him, but there are enough to go to destruction with one man for that is there fate.  Lyman Wight is about 200 miles above Galena. There was about 40 families went with him but four of the families got tired and came away at the risk of their lives.  If the statements of these new are true Lyman is gone to the devil.  He is drunk every day and will not suffer the men to labor for their bread but he says they must live on the gentiles so that his company bids fair for being a real band of "Gadianton robbers."  They leave already conspired to n...der three families of traders in the neighborhood when they are but way disapointed. The traders have heard of it and they have circulated when the Indians return (who are now West receiving their  annuities) to set them as them and I think there is danger thats they will suffer.  I give you this as the repast of those who have left his party and I am much inclined to believe it.  Those who have left Lymans party are Jacob Neoooom's,  Merrinus W. Loveland, and his son in law any my brother David with their families.  Now you may well think that after the church has thus vomited and purged we feel better the atmosphere seems to be a great deal more pure and the Saints ENDENTRY feel better.  The mob are still threatening but we dont apprehend any danger.  They had arranged to have a Wolfe hunt on the 27th of last month around Nauvoo and called upon the Missourians to come and help them.  The object was to surround us and provoke us to hostilities so that they could get some appearance of legality to either drive or exterminate us.  We sent word to the Governor  and on the day the Wolf hunt was to take place he was in Nauvoo at the head of about 500 men to prevent the movements  of the mobs.  The Governor has made great pretence to pro... the Laws and has repeatedly pledged himself to execute them and have the murderers arrested.  The Sheriff went to Warsaw and arrested Sharp but the citizens rescued him.  The Governor then gave them to understand that he  should have them any how and they finally concluded to give themselves up.  Sharp and Williams and the great rascal of a Joseph H. Jackson gave themselves up.  the two  former were taken to Turkey and there held to bail.  I was two near dead to day ...We think privately that the Governor has made a bargain with them and they will get clear.  We esteem the Governor as one of the wards of the mob and are well satisfied that he means us no good.  But there is a God in Israel and he hears our prayers, for we have seen it repeatedly.  God is with us.  He is with the Twelve in all their movements and if you was here you would see the months of the prophet on brother Brigham very plain.  The church feel well and we will leave a good conference.  Yesterday was  spent in preaching in the morning by Jon...g and then  afternoon by Er Taylor.  Things look good, the Temple moves rapidly,  There are now ten of the Capitals on the walls and more will be on this week.  You will hear from the brethren I suppose and the time is drawing news to go to meeting and I must close by expressing my warmest love to you and to all of like faith.  Remember me to all enquirers and I remain yours as ever Wm Clayton ENDENTRY P.S.  I want you to send me the earliest opportunity about thirty or forty yards of good fine Irish Linnen, fine enough for garments and robes.  And also a good black silk lace veil for my wife.  You will find some who want to send money to the Temple  and you can buy them with it and I will refund it here,  because I cannot get such as I want less than 7/-- pr yard here and I know they can be got very cheap in England.

Dear Brother:  It has been brought to my attention that some of the Presidents of Stakes do not fully understand the communication I addres- sed to them on the 24th inst. with regard to those to whom recommends should be granted to attend the dedicatory services at the Temple in this city.  In that letter I used the words "ordinary recommend", intending that that expression should convey to the minds of the brethren the idea that such should be granted subject to the usual provisions and restrictions, or those members of the church that you could not recommend to the privileges of its dedication.  We do not deem it just or proper that those who have no been living their religion, who have neglected their duties, or have wronged their brethren should have equal privileges with the faithful an the worthy.

Singleton to press take com- mand of the "Nauvoo Legion." He felt a good  deal chagringd at me beleiving his own statement relative to his ignorance; he tried to excuse him self, but only made the matter worse. Elder Brigham Young is now Leuftenant General and all  things are going on well in the legion. We have  just sent for and obtained 250 United States muskets  we have purchased them ourselves and are not depen- dant upon others for them. We are also contem- plating going into the various branches of man- turing and shall be able this winter, we beleive to  supply all the different tradesmen with all  the work they can do. A few cutlers would be  very serviceable here.

The church was never in a more properous  condition that at the present. illegible and every  ENDENTRY other ism is flating out and peace order and union  prevails.  I think that we never had so large  an assembly at a conference, and there never was  more business transacted in the time nor did  I ever see so much harmony nor a greater confidence  manifested in the authorities of the church. There were upwards ^about^ 500 I believe ordained into  The seventies, and 100 into The High Priests Quorum  We have divided the United States of into  different districts and have appointed one or more  high priests ro preside in those different dis- tricts, and to take charge of the churches embraced  in their several bounderies and to preside at  the different conferences that shall be held illegible ally at the most convenient point in  respective districts:  much the same as the  churches are organized in England.  This makes  it convenient as the High Priest can report to  their presidents, and the presidents to the Twelve,.  There are now eleven quorums of the seven- ties organized and filled up, and a twelvth forming, so  you will perceive that we have not been idle.  The first seventy have generally been made presidents  hence there are presidents over the several seven- ties and a presidency appointed over the whole, so  hence the presidents of the seventies can report  to the first presidency of the seventies and they to the  Twelve. ENDENTRY a few business matters and I must close.  I never  received one of your "Stars", although I receive every  other foreign paper regularly.

If it should so happen, though it is not probable, that they never have this opportunity, then the ceremony performed by you, under this authorization, will have full force and effect.  Replying further to the inquiries in your favor of 19th inst., I will say--A Bishop's Court is authorized to excommunicate from the Church, for cause, lay members and brethren holding the Aaronic Priesthood without referring the case to the High Council of the Stake. Of course the parties excommunicated have the right of appeal to that body. But if the accused holds the Melchesidek Priesthood then the Bishop's Court has authority only to disfellowship him and report its proceedings to the High Council for further action. With regard to presenting the names of those who have been disfellowshipped or excommunicated to the members of the Ward, - this is sometimes done for information, where deemed desirable, but not for the purpose of sustaining or reversing the decision of the court, but there are cases where justice and mercy would both be better served by giving the offence the least publicity possible, and confining the knowledge of the wrong doing to ENDENTRY those actually interested and to those who have, by reason of their official position, are obliged to be made acquainted with the facts.

This we do now: asking the Stake Presidencies to send us with as little delay as possible the names of as many brethren as they consistently can.  As a rule brethren over 45 years of age are no able to satisfactorly endure the tolls and vicissitudes of missionary life, but, on the other hand, there are robust, well preserved brethren to be found among us who can do so for a number of years later.

Smith -, Dear Brethren,  At present  I am out in the country  working from nature under  M. Rigolot who Bro Pratt  has made mention of  in his letters to you some  time ago.  M. Rigolot is  noted for his brilliant  sunlights and his clost  observance to nature.  He is more of a realistic  painter than an idealistic one, that is why we appreciate  him so much as a  landscape teacher. ENDENTRY Sunlight painting is  taking quite a prominent  part in modern French  art, and I may justly say that in this they far excell  Artists of an earlier date -  probably the greatest reason  for this is that the old Masters did not pay so  much attention to Landscape painting as the modern men do - Sunlight painting  affords an opportunity for a very brilliant display  of colors; but is considered  to be lacking in poetry - The artist Corot used to  say that sunlight  was vulgar.  As I expect to paint the country that  I live in, and as you  are aware Utah is noted  ENDENTRY for her sunlights, there  being but few gray-days  and very little atmosphere. I have thought it best to  pay especial attention to  this branch of landscape  painting - I shall remain  under M.

Several important matters relating to Sunday School work should be brought before those engaged in that cause; and  ENDENTRY it is very desirable that the meeting be held while the majority of the people from the different stakes who feel interested in this work, will be in the city.  At a special meeting of the Board, held last evening, I was directed to communicate with you in their behalf.

Dear Brother:  We hear that the Constitutional Convention of your Ter- ritory has adopted a Constitution which, without being free from objections, is probably as good a Constitution as is likely to be adopted at any time in the near future.  The advantages of living in a State ought to be highly valued by every citizen. It is true, State government is more expensive; but under that form the people have the right to govern themselves and to elect their own officers, instead of their being appointed at the caprice of politicians.  What is the feeling of our people upon the subject? Are they likely to vote in favor of the Constitution or not?  It is very important to them that what they do in this matter should be done carefully, and with due deliberation.  Were we living in your Territory, with the knowledge that we have of the situation, we think we would certainly vote for the adoption of the Consti- tution, because we are of the opinion that the results would be beneficial.  Our view is that our people should vote for the Constitution, unless there are strong and overpowering reasons of which we have no knowledge why they should not.  Our object in mentioning this to you is that through inattention or carelessness the election should not be allowed to go without those who have the right to vote expressing their views by ballot on this important subject. Everyone that has a vote should not fail to express his will ENDENTRY 2.  upon this question at the polls, when the occasion for doing so shall ar- rive.  In writing in this strain to you we do so with the expectation that you will take the necessary steps to bring this matter clearly to the attention of all who are interested, that nothing may be lost by negligence.  The question of holding a general conference of the Stakes in Arizona has been brought to our attention by Elders John Henry Smith and John Mor- gan, and after conversing with them we are of the opinion that a conference held annually, commencing on the first Sunday in July, would probably be as convenient for all concerned as any that we know of. We understand that the place of holding this conference has been agreed upon by yourself and the other Presidents of Stakes, and that Pine Top is the place.  With kindest regards,  We are  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P. O. Box.

I am in entire accord with the views you express regarding the unde- sirability of holding a Conference in your Stake next June,and think you had better inform the Saints that that Conference will not be held,but in place thereof invite as many as possible to attend the Conference at Pine Top in July.

Dear Brother:-  In accordance with the vote of the Priesthood which was taken in the Salt Lake Temple on the 10th ins t.,apportionments of the amount necessary to complete the Temple for its dedication on the 6th day of April,1893, have been made to the various stakes of Zion.  The apportionment to your stake is $600.00.   The allotments to the stakes have been placed as low as possible, and it is necessary that each stake make up its full amount.  We suggest that you and your counselors consider the circumstances of the brethren of your stake, and select therefrom as many as are able to pay say from one to four hundred dollars each, to complete the House of the Lord; and then an appeal be made to them to pay such amounts as you may deem proper.  This being done you can then call upon the other mem- bers of your stake to make up whatever amount is necessary to complete your allotment.  If the money is paid, say, one half on or before December 15th 1892, and one half on or before March 1st 1893, it will answer the purpose.  But we trust you will bring this matter to the attention of the Saints without delay, as there must be no failure in this great undertaking. ENDENTRY (2)  We feel to promise the people, through you, the blessings of the Lord both temporal and spiritual, if they will faithfully and freely meet this obligation which we have all taken upon ourselves.

Freeman, in relation to his case that was tried before the High Council of your Stake.  The object in bringing Brothers Crosby and Freeman was to give us an opportunity to learn from them concerning the trial before the Bishop's Court and before the High Council.  After hearing all that was said upon the subject, and espe- cially from Brother Milner concerning his rot having been properly notified, and his willingness to agree to that which was reasonable to make satisfac- tion, we promised him to write to you.  The assurance that Brother Freeman gave concerning the willingness of the brethren to pay it themselves rather than have any trouble, prompted us to exhort Brother Milner to seek an early settlement, as we believed from the spirit that Brother Freeman described as existing among the Saints who are interested in this case, that it would not be a difficult matter for Brother Milner to make affairs right if he had the disposition he should have, as a Latter-day Saint.  Brother Milner is a man of peculiar temperament, and cannot very well be judged by the standard which we expect other men to be measured ENDENTRY by; but we believe he desires to retain the fellowship of the people and his standing in the Church; and while we do not think it would be proper to submit to wrong from him, still if you can meet him in the spirit of con- cession no doubt it will have the effect to save him from serious difficulty in connection with his standing in the Church.  The reports we hear of him  while in Teasdale, President of the British Mis- sion, give us a good opinion of his labors while a missionary in England, and this was about the time by your action he was severed from the Church.  Trusting you will be able to settle this matter to the satisfac - tion of all concerned,and agreeable to the Spirit of the Lord.  We remain,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F.

Udall and Counselors,  St. Johns Stake of Zion  Dear Brethrens: Shorthly after the last general conference in this city we had one or two interviews with John B. Milner at which Brother Freeman and Brother Crosby of your stake were present; and we became satisfied from all that was said that there had been irregularities in the trial of the case of John B. Milner before the Bishop's court and before the High Council though we did not say so to him. Brother Freeman heard all the conversation and understood its purport, also Brother Crosby - if he is with you still.. We have received the enclosed papers from John B. Milner concerning this case, and we send them to you for your considereation. John B. Milner is a very peculiar man; he has oddities of manner and in his way of doing business that create unfavorable impressions concerning his soundness; but we believe that underlying these peculiarities he has a strong love for the Gospel and values his connection with the people very highly. We do not know why he should have been published as excommunicated as this is not the general custom, and there are many cases more flagrant than his that are no published. We might not however have noticed the publication particularly had it not been that at the time of the appearance of the notice in our papers we had advices from President ENDENTRY John B. Milner was doing quite a good work as a missionary in that country, though he had not been sent there as a missionary.  We would like you to give this case the fairest possible consideration, and let us know what you have to say on the subject. We would very much like to have this business settled up and this man restored to a standing in the Church if it can be done consistently with the principles of righteousness. In dealing with men we have to take them as they are, and deal more leniently with some than with others because of the difference of their organization and knowledge. The Lord deals with His children in this manner, and we ought to deal with each other in this spirit. A rule we might with perfect propriety apply to one man might not in perfect justice be applied to another.  With kindest regards,  Your Brethren,  Willford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F.

Salt Lake City, Utah  December 31, 1896  TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES,  Dear Brethren:- In consequence of the decision which was reached at our last April Conference upon the sub- ject of making allowances to different officers of the Church for ser- vices, affairs have been in an unsettled condition, and there has been uncertainty prevailing upon the subject of drawing from the Church any compensation for services rendered.  As was explained on that occasion, it was not the design to deprive the brethren who are laboring in various capacition and spending more or less of their time in the public service, of some compensation.  The design was to prevent the growth of a feeling that certain officers in the Church were to receive a certain amount.  We all felt that it was not a wise thing - in fact, that it was contrary to the purpose of the Almighty - that the minis- ters of His Church should receive fixed sums as salaries.  And it was pleasing to us to see the manner in which our views upon this question were received by the assembled brethren.  The question has arisen, What allowance shall be made to the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors? Shall we allow them the same amounts that we did formerly? Or what amounts shall we allow them?  In order to answer this question, we suggest that each Presi- dent of Stake and his Counselors get together, and, knowing each other's circumstances, decide what amount they think would be proper under the circumstances for each of them to receive; with the under- standing, however, that the aggregate amount shall not exceed the amount heretofore allowed.  There may be members of the different Presidencies of Stakes who may be in circumstances where they need but little, if anything, from Church funds to help sustain them, and who would take pride in rendering their services gratuitously to the Church.  Some of these may be Presidents, and some Counselors.  On the other hand, there may be some Presidents and some Counselors who are in circumstances which require that they should receive some compensation for their services.  Each President with his Counselors can decide this and forward the statement to the office of the First Presidency.  By doing this we think that the purpose we had in view in our counsel to the Priesthood at the April Conference will be carried out.  When these reports are received, and they are acceptable to the Trustee-in-Trust, arrangements will then be made for orders to be sent covering the amount  Your Brethren in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff Geo.

Woodruff Dear Brother.  Your favor of the  6th  inst. rec'd.  I beg leave to say in reply that I  did not publish the names referred to without first  consulting such persons as would be immediately  interested; and in such cases as personal injury  would be likely to occur, or where parties themselves  did not wish the circumstance of their having  been sealed to the Prophet made publice, we have  not published them.  Most of what I published in  this connection has been in print, ^before^ and hence was  public property already, and what new matter I  added I have not added without counseling with  those whose right it is to counsel me, or at least  making full explanations of my plan and object,  which was simply this:  A great number of persons,  (among them tho of my own brothers) are constantly  listening to the Josephites, who claim that the Prophet  Joseph never taught nor practised the principle of  plural marriage, and they are gaining followers daily,  perhaps, on that ground.  I have argued, reasoned and  ENDENTRY discussed with some of them, until I thought it was necessary, for the sake of honest people, who are willing  to be convinced, to republish in a compiled manner  such affidavits and testimonies as had formerly been made public, but were scattered and partly lost, having  been published in different papers and at different  periods.  Now, brethren; with the exception of summing  up and adding a few new names, I have simply  stated what has been stated before, and I hope no  harm has been done, but that good will result there from.  By way of further explanation I beg leave to  say that the article was published before I knew any thing of a Constitutional Convention coming of, or I  would perhaps have had judgment enough to postpone  publication at present, or at least referred the matter  to you before printing.  There is, however, one consolation  in connection ^with^ of of a possibility of harm being done, namely that the "Record" circulates only among our  own people, and save a harmless notice about it  in the Salt Lake Tribune I have heard nothing so  far ^originating from my article^ that would harm us politically.  In justice to  myself I deem this explanation necessary, adding  that I at all times shall hold myself subject to  counsel from those in authority in the Church over  me, and that I, in consequence, shall  (according to  your desire and judgment) not  "give any more  names," until you shall advise me to do.  With kind regards I remain Your Brother  in the Gospel of Christ, Andrew Jenson.

Dear Brethren:- It appears to me, in view of the political changes which have been made of late in the nation, and those which are likely to occur in the near future in your Territory, that it is of the utmost importance for the Latter-day Saints to so arrange their affairs and organize their domestic and other relations as not ot become a prey to the wicked designs of politicians and persons disposed to cause our people trouble in consequence of their religious convictions and practices in accord therewith. I trust that those to whom the watchcare of the saints has been entrusted- the Presidency of Stakes, the Bishops and leading Elders of the Church- will be wide awake in these critical times and leave no duty undone which they can do, to guard and protect the interests of the people of God with whom they are called to labor; and by the eye of faith and wisdom that they will be able to foresee the dangesrs which may threaten, and take the necessary steps to forewarn, advise and direct, for their safety, such as may be exposed to the evil intentions of their enemies.  Having called your attention to this important subject, I leave it with you to take such steps as in your wisdom and in the spirit of your callings, propted by the Holy Ghost, you may consider the most prudent, safe and effectual.

Dear Brother!  Yesterday morning Prest. Angus M. Cannon called on me and brought  a special and direct message from you to  the effecct that you desired me to give  to L. P. Neve a deed to some property  which I own in Mill Creek, and which  said Neve has been suing me for in  court.  Immediately upon receiving your  message, I want to my attorney, Bro. Franklin L. Richards, and instructed him  to hand over the deed which had  already been executed.  And L. P. Neve  will be notified by me personally to-day  that Bro. Richards will give him the  deed on his payment of some tax  money and a portion of the court  expenses.  The property in question is worth  about $5000 (it cost me more than that), and is the same property to which I executed  a deed to the trustee-in-trust, about  1 1/2 years ago, which deed could not then be  ENDENTRY delivered till a decision of the court had been  obtained  I take it for granted that you  understand the case (though I have not  mentioned the matter to you myself) and that  you had good reasons for making the request. Of course everything I have is on the altar, according to covenants which I have made; and I feel to bow in obedience to your  request, though I must confess that under  existing circumstances, I cannot think of a  person that I would not rather give my  property to than L. P. Neve.  In order not to place myself in  a false light before you, I will state that  I have already made up my mind to give  up the property, according to a most unjust  decision of a court, and was only waiting  for the adjustment, by my attorney, of some  miner matters connected with it.  But  I had not looked for a request from  the president of the Church to do so.  With the best of feeling toward  you, I remain Your Brother in the Gospel, Andrew Jenson  Note:  Jensen was seen in regard to this by G J Gibbs, about one and  a half hours after it was brought to the office by himself,  and was informed by Bro Gibbs that Pres.

D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. Box 1678.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 18. 1894  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  During my travels in the interest of Church history during the last four years, including visits to the States, Mexico and Canada. I have expended considerable means in defraying traveling expenses.  I have also worn out a buggy entirely, and another in part, on my journeyings, as I have visited quite a number of the Stakes traveling with my own conveyance I have also employed a member of my family a great portion of the time to help me in my labors, which has enabled me in scores of instances to get through with certain work in a day when it otherwise would have taken two.  I have not asked the Church to bear my traveling expenses so far, nor do I desire to ask for that to be done in the future, as long, as I can possibly defray them myself; but ENDENTRY I write these lines simply to ask if it would not be proper to allow me some credit on tithing.  I am behind in my tithing this year, and also for last year, and having spent the means which should have gone to the tithing office as stated, I would be pleased to have an entry made to my credit on this year's account, if it can be done done consistantly If not, I desire to pay my tithing any way, as I am a believer in the principle, and want my record on earth as complete as possible in this regard, as well as in other respects.  Praying the Lord to bless you and your Counselors with heaven's richest blessings, and that you during this inclement part of the season may be preserved in the enjoyment of good health, I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,  Andrew Jenson  Andrew Jenson Dec. 18 '94 ENDENTRY L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. Box 1678.  Salt Lake City, Utah, June 5, 1894  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  The enclosed letter signed by Charles M. Jeppson, A. C. Thomsen and Mads Nielsen, of Pleasant Grove, Utah Co., was handed me this morning by Elder George Reynolds for answer.  By way of explanation I will say that I paid the means referred to strictly according to the written instructions of the late Thomas Andersen, and happily I am still in possession of the original documents authorizing me to do as I did.  The late Thomas Andersen never as much as intimated that I should pay any or all of it to the Pleasant Grove ward: I was to pay it to the Trustee in Trust of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to be used by him according to his judgment for the benefit of the Church, If he should decide to use part of it for the benefit of the Pleasant Grove first ENDENTRY Ward, I have no objection; but certain it is that the donor of the means never exposed himself to me to have this done; nor do I recollect that any of the admi- nistrators hinted at such a thing until after I had paid over the means as directed in writing by the late Thomas Andersen.  After the death of Bro. Andersen I paid $150 to each of two heirs, children of Bro. Andersen, and in doing so, I took pains to ask both of them (one of them) the husband of an heir if they had any objections to the remainder being paid over to the Trustee-in-trust, as directed in the written document, signed by the late Thos. Andersen, which I read to them. Both expressed the desire that his request be complied with; and it was done accordingly. I have always known what to do with the money, the statement to the contrary not- withstanding.  When I paid the money to the Trustee-in-Trust, I agreed to shoulder the responsibility I repeat now that I am responsible for my actions in this matter, and you need not be troubled anymore concer- ning it.  With the highest esteem I remain,  Your Brother in the Gospel  Andrew Jenson. ENDENTRY Historian's Office, Oct. 1, 1897. To The First Presidency And Apostles. Dear Brethren:-  In response to your request that I should prepare  a series of tracts for missionary purposes, as suggested by the  brethren in charge of the British Mission, I have written twelve  tracts which I believe will meet the neccessities of the times in  that particular.  After entering upon the work I thought it better  to continue and complete the series uniformly, than to cull from other pamphlets or to mix in other tracts.  This set will make a  series of twelve tracts of four pages each, and will introduce the  First Principles of the Gospel, the Apostacy, the Restoration, the  Authority of the Priesthood, the Book of Mormon, Baptism for the  Dead, the Establishment of Zion, the Work Performed by the Saints  in Utah, etc., in consec^u^tive order, one tract leading up to those  succeeding.  I believe they will be found suitable for distribution  in any of the Missions.  I hold them at your disposal, and if you  see fit to refer them to any person or committee for review, I shall  be pleased to submit them, and assist in their inspection if you so  desire.  Very respectfully yours, C. W. Penrose ENDENTRY Bro I Goddards Court  E 2nd South  May 26/93  President W. Woodruff  + Council  My dear Brethren/  I was pleased and gratified with my short interview- with you on Tuesday, especially in reference to the subject of Temperance you kindly called up for remarks.  I listened attentively to the position taken by Bros George Q Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith, and since then, having had some reflections bearing on the same, will you kindly bear with me while I express them and give them that consideration their importance deserves.  After an Elder has been advocating the Word of Wisdom, would there be any impropriety for him to submit a simple test with a view of finding out how many of his congregation were brought under conviction, and were ENDENTRY willing to bear testimony to the same, by signing their resources to an obligation, promising to abstain from the use of Tea, Coffee, Cigarettes, Tobacco, + Intoxicating drinks, and the use of meats, only in moderation. Some of all ages would sign such a pledge in every congregation, a card of membership should then be given them, and their names entered in a book,called,say "illegible" 1 Division Another appeal should then be made to the same congregation for those to sign another pledge, promising to abstain from the use of "Tobacco and Strong drink," a card should be given to them as members  of No 2 Division, of the Latter day Saint Temperance Society.  When that is done, ask all the members of both division to arise and I venture an assertion that in many instances the great majority of the congregation would arise. I cannot imagine any other effort that could be made, that would lead to such ENDENTRY glorious results.  Religion without morality is simply a farce, and the thousands of professing Latter day saints, whose daily habits of life, being in direct antago -nism to the Word and Will of the Lord, certainly calls aloud for some mighty effort, to stem this torrent of iniquity. Strong drink the fascinating dram, and  Saloons and Gambling hells, the rendezvous, where all kinds of evil, such as fighting, stealing, whoring, sabbath breaking +c +c are concocted.  If any direct effort can be inaugurated to dry up in our community these hell traps, so that our youth can be successfully brought up without their contamination, happy will those be who take an active part, and all who countenance and lend their influence in that direction.

Ther is an enjoyment in meeting our brethren and companions in tribulations that the world knows not off because it flows from a celestial source. After spending a short time in conversing with my friends a more important scene was now to open to my view than Kings ever saw or Princes ever knew in this generation which was to visit the Temple of the Lord and its contents Elder Smoot and myself visited each appartment of the House accompanied by Elder Parrish and I must confess the scenery is indisscribable When I entered the threshhold of the house and Passed into the lower room their was great solemnity if not awe immediately overwh elmed me I felt indeed as if my footsteps were in the Temple of the Lord After walking into the Pulpets erected for the Priesthoods and viewing the curtains all bespeaking that grandure, solemnity and order that nothing short of wisdom from God could invent. We then visited the upper rooms and there viewed four Egyptian Mumies and also the Book of Abram written by his own   ENDENTRY hand and not ownly the hieroglyphicks but also many figures of the that this precious treasure contains are calculated to make a lasting impression upon the mind which is not to be erased many other important views I was Privileged with in the upper story the school rooms, belfry andC. all indicating great architecture and wisdom we then spent some time in visiting the Bank and Printing office But wonder on wonder strikes my sense to look into the casket of the great work of Israels God in these Prophet exclaims he does things we looked not for: Two and a half years since I left Kirtland with my Brethren in their Poverty to go fourth to visit our brethren in tribulation in zion then our Brethren in Kirtland were poor, despised, and even looked upon By the pomp of Babylon with disdain and disgrace who stood waiting with eager eyes to behold them sink into forgetfulness.
