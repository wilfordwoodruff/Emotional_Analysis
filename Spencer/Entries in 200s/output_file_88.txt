I have not the means topay my way for such a tripâ€” neither am I allowed to inform the Saints here of themessageâ€”since its import must emi-nate from Zion. Therfore I shall burythe secret within my own heart untilsuch time as you shall unseal my lips. I will forward this message in a regis-tered package, and the Lord will see to it that it comes safely into your hands.Asking your blessing, and promisingfealty on my part, I remain yourfellow servant of our Lord, the MostHigh God.

Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:About a year ago I received aletter from the Missionary Committee inquiringif it would be consistent with my feelings andcircumstances to take a mission. I replied that itwould be a pleasure to me to respond to any call madeof me t[h]rough the Priesthood, but that I had a mail contract which would not be completed untilJuly of this year. I then received another, requestingme to report to you whenever I found myself in aposition to respond to a call to preach the gospel.In compliance with which, I now take theliberty to report that I shall be through withe my mail contract on July 1st next. It will take mesome little timeâ€”probably a month or six weeks after thatâ€”to finish up my business; And then if my services areneed^ed^ I shall hold my self subject to your call.I spoke to Elder John Henry Smith on the subject whenhe was here recently.Very truly, Your brother,Joseph W. Smith.That will be all right. J. F. S.
