Woodruff—St. George—Dear Brother:Your letter of 27th inst. from Nephi,"desiring my attendance" at the Conference of the Y. M. M.I. Associations at Ogden on Sunday last, came duly tohand. Agreeable to your request I made arrangementsfor Bros. D. B. Wells and C. W. Penrose to attend the Tooele Con-ference, and I went to Ogden and attended the youngpeoples Conference. There was a large attendance, thehouse being completely filled. We had a very interestingtime so far as the meetings were concerned. The morningwas occupied by reports and short lectures fromvarious young men, on the subjects of the "Organiza-tion of the Church," "The Miracles of Jesus," "The Constitu-tion of the U. S." and the "Divine origin of the Book of Morm-on." The afternoon was occupied by administeringthe Sacrement, sustaining the authorities of the Associations, and a discourse by myself. So far sogood, and I think you will accord with mein this, but now comes the subject which is the cause 
 [upside-down text] See "Suggestions of the Apostles." &c. Contributor, of May 1880—page191. [end of upside-down text]of this writing. In your letter of instructions you say, "I thinkit desirable if you could consult with the Presidency of the Stake and appoint a good man, one that wouldmeet with the approval of the Societies and be sustainedby them to fill the position" vacated by Jos. A. West. Agreeableto this instruction I "consulted with the Presidency," and to mysurprise and disappointment I found they were not unitedand had never consulted together on this subject. Thecounsellors claimed that they had been ignored and slightedand the feeling ran high, and extended back to times past andother things. I found it impossible to reconcile them or to cometo any agreement in the time which we had, and the only thingI could do was to propose a postponement of the considerationof the subject until some future time. Bro. Peery was eager forme to make the nomination myself and put it through. This Iconsidered unreasonable and unfair besides being entirelyopposed to the written instructions on this point, so I ref-used to do it. And told him I did not propose to carry hisburdens for him. The instructions upon this matter, so far asI can recall them to memory ^is^ for the "Presidency of the Staketo appoint the Stake Presidents of the Associations subjectto the approval of the High Council." ^&c.^ This had not been doneI therefore declined to do anything in the premises, and ad-vised the Presidency to go to work and carry out this rule.With very kind regards to yourself, Prests. Taylor, Cannonand all the company I am your bro. in the Gospel Jos. F. Smith

For some time after its publication your discourse was the chief topic of conversation among the Saints; it was also read in some of the ward meetings.Many with whom I conversed upon the subject ex-pressed a desire to see the discourse printed in pamphlet form, that they might be the better able to preserve it.  Now, my object in writing is to ascertain if you would have any objection to your discourse being printed in a neat, pamphlet form, exactly as it appeared in the Deseret Semi-Weekly News.  If not, it would give me pleasure to print the pamphlet.Awaiting your reply, I remain, dear Brother,your fellow-servant in the Gospel of ChristWilliam A. Morton.278 C. Street Salt Lake City.

 April 18th 1845, 36 Chapel Street LiverpoolFather & Mother WoodruffHaving an opportunityof Forwarding a letter by private conveyanceto the United States by an Elder who is about toSail to Boston, I thought I would drop a fewlines to you, to let you know that we are inthe land of the living & in the enjoyment of goodhealth. I have felt vary anxious to hear fromyou since we have been here but have not asyet herd a word from you or about you sincewe left New York and at that time you was insumthing of an unsettled state in your temporalaffairs, I suppose you would like to know sumthingwhat I am doing in this Land. I will therefore saythat I have had more business on hand since my arivalhere than at any one time During life I found theSaints needed in much council & many after alterations throughvarious portions of the British dominions. I have takena tour through Scotland & a part of England sinceI came I have held many conferences since I camewe held our general conference at Manchester on6th April it lasted th[r]ee & a half days & more businessdone than ever before in any one conference in Englandtheir was represented on that occasion ten thousand saintssave 90, in England, Scotland, Ireland & Wales & inclidingtheir families would probably amount to 30,000 soulsWe had a large congregation to leav these chirches represe-nted, & [illegible] the business of leaving the churches represented,& appointing the Elders to take charge of them and attending to thebusiness that necessarily has to be done at such conferencesWe established a joint stock company for the purposeof Establishing manufactories in Nauvoo the whole stock 
 is divided into sixty thousand stores making a Capitolof one hundred & fifty thousand Dollars the way the storesare now selling it will be but a little time before the Stockwill be taken up. This will be a great help in building upNauvoo in esstablishing business in cotton & wool & irontrade & employing the poor in that place, we had donethis in order to [concentrate] the wealth through & union ofthe Saints in this land with the Saints in America, saveone taking as high as 100 Stores, I have just received letters &papers from Nauvoo all bearing good News they have commancedbuilding the dam on the Mississippi River I am con[?] onthe Emigration Business, printing, Temple Tything, & Having thepresidency of the ten thousand Saints gives me a plenty of suplyI am now providing 3000 Doctrine & Covenenants whichwill readily sell as soon as out of press as their is greatcall for them in this land, we shall emigrate the familiesvia New York & Boston During the summer monthsI have not yet received any letters from Br Webster nor heardfrom him ownly as I see his name in the Neighbor asa letter from Father Carter a few days since who informed methat they were all ^well^ that Sister Foss family who were so verysick when we were there had all got well again, & ourlittle Phebe was very well, I was glad to hear fromthem. My health is very good, which is the case withour home though I have heard some time I came Ihave had one journey through Scotland & I intend to visitLondon & France soon, But among the Signs of the timesa dark war cloud is appearing over England & America therehas never appeared as great a project for it is believed thetwo countries since peace was proclaimed as at the presenttime. Sir Robert Peel has taken a strong stance against Mr. Polk speach on the Oregon question. Either Sir Robert Peelor Mr. Polk must recall what they have said or at leastnot attempt to carry their missions into operation if no 
 their will assuredly be war, & knowing the minds of bothgovernments I do not believe they will either of them yieldthe point, great excitement prevails here upon the subject.England is making great preparation for it 16,000 troops havebeen ordered to embark for Canida. As I was coming homefrom the office to day I saw hand Bills through the streetheaded in large letters War War with America thelast steem ship was Delaid by parliment to takea messenger from London to Washington. I expect itwill be decided I expect in a short time, if war isproclaimed I shall probably leave for America. I believethe day is not far Distant when the American people willhave sumthing to do besides fighting the Latter Day SaintsI believe the Nation is rife for judgment & a Scourge awaitsher.

As to myself I all still a [illegible]as it were in Mormonism for it is my life meet & drink andI do not expect to be any thing els but a Mormoneither in life or Death. I have never felt as great aresponsibility resting upon me as at the present timeand when I consider it it certainly looks like a marvelouswork & a wonder that an obscure unlearned Miller shouldstand in England at the head of ten thousand saints, charteringShips to gather them to this land of Zion establishing printing pressesforming a company with a capitol of $150,000, dollars to buildup Nauvoo I truly feel the saying a prophet is not without honorsave his own country but it is of the Lord & not of man & tohim be the glory.

 Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution.ORGANIZED 1868.OFFICERS:WILFORD WOODRUFF, President,MOSES THATCHER, Vice-Prest.,THOS. G. WEBBER, Secretary, A. W. CARLSON, Treasurer.DIRECTORS:Geo. Q. Cannon,Jos. F. Smith,H. J. Grant,John Sharp,W. H. Rowe,J. R. Winder,H. Dinwoodey,P. T. Farnsworth,J. R. Barnes,G. Romney,T. W. Jennings.SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MARCH 16, 1891.TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ZION'S CO-OPERATIVE MERCANTILE INSTITUTION:The increase of trade and demand made upon the Institutionby some of its best customers for accommodation, convinces us thatour capital of $1,000,000 is inadequate to transact the largebusiness of almost $4,000,000 per annum that the Institution isnow doing; particularly when it is remembered that upon some linesof goods we have to give four months' time after the goods have arrived here and been sold.At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on the 15th of February, the subject of increasing the Capital Stock was referredto a special committee who have reported, recommending that theCapital be increased 2,500 shares, and that $135 per share becharged for this increase, $100 of which will be credited to Cap-ital Stock account, and the remaining $35 to Reserve Fund, so as to place the new stock exactly on a par with the old, so far asreserves are concerned.In our showing just made of the assets and liabilities ofthe Institution, it will be seen that we have a Reserve Fund of $350,000, to say nothing of the extremely low valuation placedupon real estate and buildings and on our stock of merchandise;so I have no hesitation in saying that at $135 per share, it isunder rather than over the actual value of the Stock. Our showingfor the past year is a good one, as good as any we have heretofore made, and we have every reason to believe that we shall continueto do a large and prosperous business, and I see no cause why weshould not be able to pay as good dividends as we have heretoforedone, after this increase has been added to the Capital Stock.It is proposed to allot this Capital Stock pro rata to our presentstockholders in the proportion of 25 per cent of their presentholdings, but no subscription will be received for fractional partsof a share, excepting from such as now own a fraction and desireto make up a full share.A circular has been prepared, which I have pleasure inenclosing with this, upon which stockholders will kindly notifythe Secretary of the Institution whether they wish to subscribeand take ths additional stock or otherwise. It is important thatthe matter should be attended to by the stockholders as early aspossible and the notification returned without delay. The newStock must be paid for to the Treasurer of the Institution, one-half on or before May 1st, and the balance on or before Aug. 1st,1891.Respectfully,Wilford WoodruffPresident.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P.O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah, August 23, 1895.Prest. James E. Steele and Couselors,Presidency Bingham Stake. of Zion,Dear Brethren:Since the visit of Bro. Steele to this city we have further considered the question of laocation of headquarters of your stake, and have fully concluded, after conferring with Elder John Henry Smith who figured prominently in its organization, that Iona is in every way and the most proper as well as perhaps the most suitable place for headquarters, it not only being the residence of the stake presidency, but is also quite centrally located. We therefore recommend that the people one and all regard Iona as headquarters of your stake.As a stake organization you are starting out with the very best of prospects. You have a remarkably good country, both healthful and fruitful, with an abundant supply of water and singularly well adapted to stockraising as well as agriculture. With industry, so char-acteristic of our people, coupled with intelligent management, and accompanied by the blessing of God, prosperity must necessarily attend your labors. We look for and expect prosperity to come to Zion in fulfillment of the promises of the Lord; but we are not unmindful of the fact that with prosperity come temptations, and too often evilas, which render the latter state of a people worse than the first. As we have learned to rejoice and acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the days of our poverty we certaihnly should be able to acknowledge his hand in times of prosperity; but this we can only do by being prepared to successfully meet any new conditions which a favorable change in our temporal 
 with all Church business as far as they have the power again I do not see how any Latter Day Saint can vote or hold office under that Law it throws off our property vote then lends to tax as High as they please with no one to say why do you so however I hope for the best & trust in God but it looks to me as though it were going to work Great Hardships to the Saints I was afraid that we were going to loose Sister Cottam but I am thankful to say she has revived & is getting Better but Brother Cottam is getting worse He has 2 fits in 3 days, was overcomeovercome in her sickness and it came near mak-ing letter Thompson sick as the Heft of the Brethrencame upon her Brother Thompson sent his Horse on a 4 days Journey to get another I expect to returne to the templ tomorow or as soon as his horse comes & stopt there untill the xxx is done then I shall returne to my abode I was in Arizona a few days since within 3 Miles of the spring. I expect to list it soon after & return I rather think I shall spend a Hermit Summer there as the water is cold & plenty of shade I shall not be entirely done but I shall have more of my own family one atleast I would like to have to keep me company awhile but I not do the best I can God Bless youBroth. & Sister A & all the family send love Br A. son & wife are now playing on the organ & singing Hard times come again No More But I dont think they have quite eroded My love to all the family As ever yours L A 
 circumstances may bring upon us. As leaders among the people, these two thoughts should be uppermost in your minds: The salvation of souls, and the building up of Zion. If you yourselves have these desires burining within you, you will be able to imbue your bishops and ^[their]^ coun-selors with the same feelings; and if you as a body of presiding priest-hood are united in your labors to this end you will have the power to draw the people to you and guide them in the paths of righteousness; and the evil one, who is ever on the alert to make inroads among the saints, will not have power to divide or make headway against you. Without being rigid or arbitrary you should make it a point to maintain, through the co-operation of the general priesthood, as well as that of your presiding officers, the discipline of the church, as this is the means by which the saints are preserved from the wiles of the adversary. YThe morals of the people should be jealously guarded, and the name of God should not be used in vain. These two things we would especially have you impress upon your young men. And if, in the course of events, fdiffi-culties arise among brethren, we hope they will make it a point to settle the same in an amicable way without resorting to tribunals either of the Church or State; and if possible to not let the sun go down upon their wrath.Living, as many of the brethren do live, upon their farms at long distances from each other and from houses of public worship, they are necessarily deprived more or less of that education which is derived from association afforded by settlement and town life. We trust that the brethren so situated will, with their families, not fall into the habit of working on Sundays; but that they will keep holy the Sabbath day as we are commanded to do, and make it a point to attend meetings and Sunday school.It is very important that your ward records be well kept, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, August 3, 1888.Elder John Steele,Toquerville.Dear Brother:Your very interesting favor of the 30th. of July hasbeen received and read with great pleasure.Yours has been indeed a pioneer and a busy life, andyou are in a position now to give much valuable counsel to the rising generation,and to describe to them the hardships and privations and the shifts which thesettlers of this country had to contend with and to resort to in the beginning.A new generation is now upon the scene, and though they hear occasionally con-cerning the work of the pioneers and the difficulties they had to contend with,still, in this city particularly, their ideas are exceedingly vague respectingthese matters, and the men and women who can give them information from theirpersonal experiences are fast passing away. There are really but few left.I am glad that you have mentioned the birth of your daughter; for there is another claimant for the honor of being the first whitechild born in the Valley after the arrival of the Pioneers. As I now remember 
 the date of his birth as it was announced, your daughter was born before he was.I think I shall have your letter published in the Deseret News, as it containsa number of interesting items that are worthy of preservation.I am glad to hear from you that you are enjoying your-self so well, and that your heart still beats with the love of Zion and thedesire to see the Kingdom of God more widely spread and established. That youmay live very many years yet to see the fruits of your labors and the increaseof righteousness in the earth, is my earnest desire.With kind regards, I am,Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 that proper care be taken of them as they become filled up, for future generations will highly prize and make good use of them.In the erection of public buildings the greatest wisdom should be exercised. They are public property and should, therefore, reflect the general intelligence and tatste of the people, and we hope that due regard will be shown in the beauty of their design, ventilation, &c., by obtaining the best available architectural ability in the preparation of the plans. And we may add in this connection, that whatever you may undertake in the way of erecting public buildings, invlolving a consider-able expenditure of means, should be done as much as possible within your own resources, and not with the expectation that the Church may be relied upon to make up deficiencies. Some of our stake and ward officers have of late found themselves in the exceedingly unpleasant position of being totally unable to meet public obligations contracted by them without our knowledge or consent, ^and for the payment of which they themselves were held individually ^responsible;^^ and they have appealed to us to help them to preserve their credit and maintain their financial honor, while at the same time we were over-burdened ourselves. We have felt that if brethren look to us for help for such purposes, they should consult us before they involve themselves, and thus afford us an oppor-tunity of conferring with them as to the advisbability of such undertak-ings; otherwise they should depend wholly on their own resources. In most of the stakes there is what is called a stake meeting house, a building erected by the stake as a whole, which answers a good and worthy purpose in the rich and populous stakes; but in newly organized and sparsely settled stakes such a large central building it would not be advisable to undertake to erect. We advise rather the erection of commodious ward meeting houses and good boweries, so that stake con-ferences acan be taken to the people, so to speak; that is, they can be held in the wards with bowery accommodations in the summer season, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. May 9th, 1889.Elder John Steele,Toquerville.Dear Brother: Your letter of May 5th has been received, in which you set forth the expressed wishes of your sister, made before her death and after your explaining to her the true order of marriage and of adoption of her children, to be sealed to you for eternity, instead of to her husband; and if that was not ad-missible, that she be sealed to your son, M. M. Steele. You also rsay "I told her I did not know how that would be; such things had been done, but I did not know how it would be again."Of course, I am not econversant with what information you may have on this subject; but I am not aware of any such sealings or adoptions in this Church. I do not consider it proper for any such sealings or adoptions to be administered in the Temples of the Lord. It is not any more proper for your sister to be sealed to you as her husband, now that she is dead, than it would be if she were alive; neither should she be sealed to your son, because such a marriage is too near of 
 kin.If your sister, while alive, did not feel that she wished to be sealed to her living husband for eternity, and if she did not express any preference on that matter other than the ones you mention, you should then make a choice in her behalf, and have her sealed to some faithful man in the Church, either living or dead, and have her children adopted into his family.Trusting this will be satisfactory to you,I remain your brother,W Woodruff 
 the ward meeting houses in the cold weather. We believe, too, the results will be altogether better by distributing the conferences in this way than by holding them all the time at one place; and, besides, the investment involved in one large central building would be spared to you.Before closing our communication we feel to add a few words in regard to politics. You are doubtless already aware of the counsel given to the presiding priesthood at the meeting held in October 1893 on this subject, and therefore all that we now need to say is that the time which has expired since then has only gone to prove the wisdom of the policy adopted by us on that occasion. It is true that some of our brethren from a restless desire to do something for their party have failed to strictly carry out the counsel given at the meeting referred to; but it is a noteworthy fact that wherever this has been the case the results have been anything but satisfactory. We mention this for the purpose of reminding you that as a stake presidency or as individuals you have no place whatever in the field of active politics unless there be good and sufficient reasons to the contrary. In starting out in the labors of your official career it is of the utmost importance that you maintain the dignity of your high calling, and that your minds be free from bias of every description; and this we are sure will be the caseinasmuch as you seek earnestly to the Lord to know and carry out his will. In this connection it may be interesting to quote to you one of the significant sayings of the Prophet Joseph. There are three agents, he taught us, at work on the earth—the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and the spirit of the Evil One. Brethren in the days of the Prophet were deceived, and brethren all along the line since his day have been deceived, and doubtless brethren will yet be deceived as between the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, simply because they have sought to carry out their own will and way, and to minister to 
 their o[w]n personal ambitions and selfish desires rather than to be servants of God and shpepherds of his sheep. As long as you labor unselfishly for Zion, for the blessing and uplifting of the people whom God has called you to preside over, you will be entitled to His Spirit to inspire and guide you in all your labors, and you will never be found at a loss to distinguish between that Spirit which emanates from God, and that spirit whixch has its source in man. We feel to say this to you for the reason that whatever influence and power you may possess as a presidency or as individuals are given to you of the Lord; and as God our Father is a jealous God, so it becomes us his servants, in whiom he ha^s^ reposed a great and important trust, to be jealous also, that is, jealous that all the power which comes from him to us, and through us to our fellow servants, is used to his honor and to his glory, for the building up of Zion, and the slalvation of our brethren and sisters.Whenever you or either of you, come to the city we shall be pleased to see you, and shall be glad to hear from you at any time on any and all important mantters pertaining to the government of your stake.  Praying the Lord to give you every needed blessing, we are, with kind regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. Cannon

WoodruffWe take the Earliest opportunity to address a few lines to you, to make you acquainted with the proceedings of the Legislators of the State of Illinois.Since they assembled in council in the City of Springfield, there has been no business of any importance transacted for the benefit and welfare of the citizens of said State, but on the other hand they have been continually debating and discussing upon the Charter of the City of Nauvoo, and the latest intelligence which we have received from Springfield is that they have repealed the City Charter also, the Legion Charter, but you know, we care nothing about it for them that would kill the prophets, would also take away our charter, but they are only filling the cup of their damnation the more which will send them to Hell, and that seems to be the place for them any how, for their works do proveit to a demonstration, they have passed judgment upon an innocent people as a community, but glory to God the day is not far distant when they shall be caught in a straight, & the measure which they meted to us shall be meted to them two fold and running over.We shall appeal right off and continue to do so, until it goes to the Federal court of the United States, and if it so be that it should also pass there, we hope and trust by that time we shall have accomplished all that the God of 
 heaven designs for this place, and we ask no favors of them, for they are poor miserable creatures at the best.The carpenters have erected a work shop on the South side of the Temple where they are busily employed preparing the materials for the inside of the building, the three story of the Temple walls are up and archerd over except six—and in the course of 4 weeks from this time if the weather is favorable all the cut stone will be ready to lay upon the walls thereof and of course it will not take long to put them on—& afterwards the roof; and thence we will finish one room alternately till the whole is accomplishedThe baptismal Font which was constructed of wood is taken away, and we are going to build ^one^ of stone all hewn and nicely cut, allso the twelve oxen will be cast of iron, or brass, or hewn stoneThe Saints here are firm and united in the bonds of love, and they are rejoicing in the blessingsof the new and everlasting covenant, and although ^the Saints^ has had to endure much, and suffer many inconveniences passed through many hardships and privations, they feel to put their trust in the living God who sitsenthroned in the Heavens above, and rules the armies of Israel, also, they are anxious to ascertain and know the things which do immediately concern their salvationboth temporal and Spiritual; a greater union never has exsisted in the bosom of the Saints, than what there is at present time, they wfeel to be docilehumble and Submissive to the powers that be, and to Sustain, ^&^ uphold the Twelve apostles of the Lamb,and go according to their council. 
 We received your letters that you wrote before you sailed and feel that they were dictated by the spirit and may the Lord bless you, and your family, give my best respects to Bro Hedlock, Bro & Sister Clark, Bro Wardand all the Saints, you had better keep Bro Hedlock with you till next fall, or, just as you and him will feel it for the best; We have just received returns from Bro Hedlock by Bro Benson, he stopp'd at Alton but we got Bro Orson Hyde to go down to St Louis and get what wassent by Bro Benson, but I did not receive a scratch of a pen from BroHedlock, his wife has received the little present he sent her, they are all well, we shall propably send you some Elders next spring to assit you, so that you and Bro Hedlock and Clark can attend pretty much to the tithing, emigration business, and the printing, the tide of emigration we expect now will be turned mostly to New York, so that the poor Saints who have been brought up in factories, can go into these factory towns in the Eastern States, get work and help themselves, so thatthey can obtain homes when they come up West, and all the time be a healthy country, still those that wish to come to New Orleans in the proper season of the year we have no objection.Bro Woodruff if you are obliged to send the poor here, [page torn] cannot pay their passage, but you have to pay it for them, let them leave something in pledge, but you know what my council was to you before you left, that w in all propability by next December we shallbe given the Saints their endowments, we are calling in the Elders to assist us this Spring and Summer, but you shall be blest in the name of the Lord, for I say so and all the rest of the brethrenWe remainYour brethren in the firmbonds of the N. & E.

 Portland Dec. 10th, 53Bro. W.Your favor of the 1st Nov. is recdWe have received nothing from Horner nor heard any thing from his wife or friends at St Josephs and I fear  that his statements to you are entirely false.

Would not Brother Little in trust himself somewhat, for I think he had his friends & Mr. Cowards also.I shall write N & Riley to night & Mr. H. and see what kind of a story they tell about the affair.You do not think well of driving stock across the plains next Season by what I have heard, I am of your opinion.The merchandise business looks well atyour place but as I am situated at present hardly done to engage in it.  there are persons who I presume are watching everymovement I make,  and at present I cannot afford to stand much of a oss.  I am in hopes if for the best, that during the comeing year I may get rid of my old troubles so that I can breath once more freely and

 having that in view think it would not be advisable to engage in that trade this season. I am tired and most worn out with those old affairs and feel a greatanxiety to dispose of them & hope I may be able to do so this comeing year.You sold those grocries remarkably well they paid a large profit. As to Books and stationary I do not now who to send to or who would take charge of them across the plains, they might go & then again they might not. I see by the Bugle that Kemesville is mostly destroyed by fire and many goods burnt up.  If you send an order for anything with directions for forwarding in season to go out this comeing spring I shall be most happy to attend to it for you as you may direct, but as I am situated here in the east I have not the slightest idea of who is intending to cross the plains or what arrangements are making for it.I feel under great obligations to you for your promptness and punctuality in our affairs and hope all will result well it looks a little unfavorable as to HornerI cannot credit a word he has told you & if there is any possible way of collecting it of him I should do it if I was in your place.

 Portland July 12th, [18]54Bro. WilfordYour favor of June 1st is justrec.d in about the usual time from your city, wasglad to hear that you were all well. We are all aswell as usual. Mrs. Carters health is not very good,about the same as usual. Father continues smart.No news of much interest, aside from strangepolitical and theological proceedings these daysthings are in strange confusion in this country, what the result may be remains to be determined.I think it would be prudent for all to bewatching, that they may be found with those"blessed servants." The $100—sent by brotherMilo Andrews was promptly rec.d. Dr Bernhiselhas not yet paid that debt. I have written tohim to day on the subject. I do not hear oneword from Hunor & Johnson in any wayand hope you will be able to pin themwhen they arrive at the valley, if they couldnot pay the money due, the least they could dowould be to write and answer my letters andmake some explanations why they dont paythey must certainly receive my letters for theywere directed to the care of Middletin & RilySt. Jus. where Mrs. Huner lives.

 Portland April 15th, [18]54Brother WilfordThinking that you will be feeling anxious to hear from Mrs. Scammon I write a line to say that I have just recd a letter from them stating that Rhoda is a little better. She has been very low and suf-fered a great deal. Luther has been much afflicted with a fellin on one of his fingers,has had his finger taken off twice, or a part of it at a time, it is now getting better.Rhoda has been ill so long that the old Lady Ms. Scammons became quite exhausted,and has died. We hope that Ms. S. from present appearances will recover.No news of interest, with us. We have a report this morning that France and England have made a final declaration of war against Russia, and the prospect is that there will be much blood shed, "the end is not yet", what the result will be remains to be determined. If we get drawn into it the consequences will be appaling.We have a certain interest in this country, that desire very much to see us involved in a general war.[Upside down text]This is a world of troubles and afflictions, but that compared with the next should mens friends not be permitted to meet here again I hope we shall meet in heaven let us remember each other at the throne of grace a number of times every day for spiritual blessings,[End of upside down text] 
 interest and the expense of purchasing adraft, for I see no reason why we shouldleave the interest for so long a time and beat the expense ^of^ again sending it across the plainsIf H. had forwarded the money as he agreed towhen he first arrive it could have easily andsafely been let for 12 pr. ct. pr. annum, increas-ing some $340—and I really don't seewhy he should not pay a part of thatamount. I enclose the note to you asrequested. I made no endorsments in thenote as the money sent by H. was not rec.dwaiting for its arrival and then put it all in at once.

We have had a very cold and disagreeable winter in Maine, the spring is backward, we have some two feet of snow on the ground nowI do not hear a word, from Homer,Johnsen, in Middleton & Riley, it is very strange they do not write, or that we do not hear in any way—We hear nothing farther from Dr. Bernhisal, shall we keep the draft for the present or return it, so that you can present it to Gov. [Living]?I think I have given you credit for the money you have forwarded and have the account all straight with one excep-tion, that is the grocery account, you stated to me the amount which I neglected to enter in my book. If in your next letter to me you will just mention the whole amount to be credited to the groceries, or what they amounted to, it will make my account complete, perhaps I may find the account you forwarded, if I was sure of it I would not trouble you.

I do not hear a word from Huneror any of his friends, not one cent of the moneyyou sent last year by him has been forwardedI think that under the circumstance you wasvery successful indeed in securing thatand in my opinion it was the best and onlycourse to take with him to save it, to drivehim right into it, after the principle is paidshould he not pay the interest? I had noconfidence in his former statements to youand I suppose he would liked to have put youoff until he could have got away. I reallydesire to feel thankful that it is in so good a shape. As you remark about business, wehardly know what a day may bring forth. Ifeel that it is very true matters are very fluctuating here.

Bernhisel was forwarded to him by us when received, for acceptance, which he refused to do stating that he was not in possession of funds that would warrant his doing it, but thought he might have some by & by that would enable him to pay it.We then wrote him proposing that he might make it payable a few months hence if he would accept it, to prevent its being protested, as a protest would be attended with some inconvenience and expense, that he also declined, and so the matter rests, we still hold the Draft, what shall we do with it?Upon the recept. if your letter informing me of Mr Horners comeing to the States I wrote him and the other man at once directing them how to forward the funds, as yet I have not heard a word from one of them.Horner seems to be a great scamp, if he has anything there that you can get hold of I think I should do it to the amount of the 
 principle and interest, if he has had that money in his possession for a year and a half or so, I see no reason why he shouldnot pay the interest on it, had it been forwarded as per agreement the interest onit to us would have amounted to quite a sum. I merely state that, and leave it with you to arrange just as you may think best and proper. A man that has treated you as Horner has, certainly has not much claim to your sympathies to the extent of justice and right.We have no news of much interest all quite well, have not heard from Mrs. Scammons for two or three weeks, at last accounts she was very low, the old Lady Mrs. Sally Scammons was dead.I hope we shall begin to get your letters regularly again, soonI did not receive the paper you sent.I send some of your papers often, do you get them, will try to write frquently and hope you will also.please remember me kindly to Phebe and all our friends, in hasteYour friendI.

 Portland Sept. 5th, [18]53Brother WilfordI shall expect in the course of five or six days to receive letters from July your mail of Aug. 1st and shall probably have occasion to write you in reply. My object of writing at this time is to make enquiries, what the prospect is for a market at your place for stock next spring or summer. I should not want to make an investment unless the prospect was particulary favorable of its proving profitableI have no money that I can afford to loose yet I am desirous of making an effort to get rid of my old liabilities. I have carriaid that load until I am nearly exhausted, and now feel as though I would make one more ef-fort to make something to help me out of the difficulty. I should not feel like starting with a share of cattle to drive through to California but I could go to your place I think (by the as-sistance of Providence) very comfortably and safelyI have been on the Humbolt once and that is about as much as I desire. If any of you folks who are responsible that are doing a California business would purchase three hundred head of stock such as would be desired for that market.

 Washington December 25, 1854Elder Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother,Your communication of the 30th of October was received on the night of the 21st instant. I regret to hearthat a part of my goods are missing. There were two bales of blankets, one of blue, and the other of white, and eleven bales of other goods. I desired brother Eldredge, if the load should be too heavy to leave the box or chest you received, at Saint Louis, but it seems he brought this and left another which I regret. In the box he brought there are three or four reams of writing and letter paper of a superior quality, envelopes large and small, pencils and quills, if you think you can dispose of these articlesyou may get them and do so.I approve you plan of taking the good into the country to dispose of.The missing bale is probably a bale of blankets, there was no bale of blankes

 but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year.The snow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground isthoroughly soaked 3 feet deep. I do not know how much deeper.Spring has broke upon us mild and warm, the top of the groundis beginning to be dry but the wells are raising.Every kind of fruit trees from the apples to the currant, are loaded with fruit buds and some of the Peaches and apricots are ready to blossom. I think it will be a fruitful year for all kindsof fruit; grain and vegetables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finishedit has been a great job. I expect the stone will come floating to theTemple, they are now hauling with cattle: the temple foundation is surrounded with stone cutters who make rich sweet music. I expect after conference there will be several hundreds cutting stone, and the tem-ple will be pushed.We have had a great Reformation this winter, one of the fruitsare all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored their stollenproperty, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: all isare tryingto pay their Tithing and nearly all are trying to get wives until thereis hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah but what is married or justgoing to be. President Young has hardly time to eat, drink, or sleepin consequence of marrying the people and attending to the endowments. I never have had so much to do in my life. I would think itwould wear him out. There has hardly been a ball or party for recreation[th]rough this Territory for the last 6 months. I have attended a meeting ofsome kind about every evening through the past winter and have not visitedyour family much, nor any body else; not among my own but littlefor 5 months and generally get to bed about 11 or 12 oclock.

Grant before he died,and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionariesrested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards; who was unwell consid-erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hydehave been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelv(except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summerTrip North to Salmon river.This Spring A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us aboutthe first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, somemissionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene andKanosh with other chiefs, are making great improvement. Arrow-peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, itwas good.We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or12.00 lbs.; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going totry the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territorysome are going to California this Spring, several in the Southernsettlements have started on the short road, or cut off to go there,and no doubt some others will follow them soon.

 1878-11-09 Apostles C C Rich and W Woodruff addressed themeeting spoke upon the rise and progress ofthe great Latter day Work and the oppositioncontending against it. God chooses the weak thingsof the world to confound the mighty as instancesin Moses in the deciples of Jesus and in the Prophet Joseph Smith & others. [##1 Corinthians 1:27##] Was pleased tosee the great facilities we have in these mountainsfor building Temples. If we could see behindthe veil we should have no trouble to getTemples built. The work for the redemption ofthe dead is great. 
 1883-08-18 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he would reportthe ward he come from. The 1st Presidencyare trying to do their best to build up GodsKingdom The Apostles and Seventies andHigh Priests are doing the same the societiesorganized to assist the Bp are doing thebest they can. We have also about 40grog shops but the saints of God do not patronizethem. Spoke on the work of the redemption ofthe dead 
 Pres W Woodruff said it gave him great pleasureand Satisfaction to meet in the beautiful buildingwith the Saints of Bear Lake. This is one of hte mostbeautiful houses ever built by the Saints in thisgeneration and it is a credit to the Pres of this Stakeof Zion and the Elders and Saints who have assistedWe have no reason to be discouraged concerningthe great work. Joseph Smith lived 14 years to laythe foundation of this work. The Lord has as farfulfilled his promises to us. He has never forsakenHis people in the midst of all their trials andpersecution nor will He in time to come. There isno people on the earth that has been called to sogreat a work as the L. D. S. many of the revelationsand prophicies would have failed had not theSaints been gathered inst. One of the greatest testimoniesis in the fact of all the Sects of the world beingunited in the persecution of this people. This workis not dead, and it is not going to die. We are here upona mission to help build up this Kingdom and iffaithful we shall, continue our labors behind the veil.Read the Book of Mormon. Doc and Cov, the Bible and all good books. We have built three Temples in these Vallieswhere we can officiate for our dead and where thatwork is being performed day by day. When we gobehind the veil we will find our history recorded inthe Courts above 
 1889-08-11Pres W. Woodruff fell thankful for the opportunityof again partaking of the Sacrament. Made remarksthereon. Gave an outline of the organization of theChurch through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Also onthe Priesthood as being the only power by which mancan administer in the ordinances of life and salvation.No matter what position a man holds if he honorshis Priesthood that man has power with the Heavens.Such a man cannot be led astray. This people will never be led astray, they will never be without a law given until Christ comes to reign. The second comingof the Son of man is near at hand, the prophicies willall be fulfilled. Let us do our duty and leave ourenemies in the hands of God. The Lord will not requirethe L. D. S. to go to war or stain their hands with blood norwill he permit our blood to be shed only perhaps inindividual cases, but not as a general thing. HonorGod and keep His commandments. To the youngpeople he would say learn to pray, they will have tobear off the Kingdom 
 1889-08-12Pres W. Woodruff. A man has a right topreach what he practices. The word of Wisdomhas been and is practiced by myself andCouncil. Don't go into debt. Don't buing machinerywhich you can do without. Pay your debts.There are men who have withdrawn from theChurch in order to accomplish their political rights.I wish to say to them that they are justified beforethe Lord.[left side of page]Pres Woodruffjustifies theMormons with-drawing from theChurch to vote.[end of text]The congregation voted in unison.Wherever there is a Church established that has notApostles, Prophets and other officers of the Church itis not the Church of God. Where they have not theAuthority of the Eternal Priesthood there is no Churchof Christ. Abraham Isaac and Jacob were Patriarchsthey held the Holy Priesthood. Joseph Smith organizedthis Church by the power of the Priesthood. Howgreatly the children of the L. D. S are blessed to livein the midst of Prophets, Apostles, Elders &c who havethe word of God. Their fathers hold the PriesthoodThey should obey them and honor them. No man cancomprihend the torments and sufferings of thosewho have tasted of the blessings of Eternal lifeand turn there from. Spoke of the mission of BroCannon to the Sandwich Islands and the introductionof the Gospel to that people. The speaker said his lifehad been preserved many times through listening tothe voice of the Spirit. Related many incidents insupport of the above. 
 1889-08-12 Pres Woodruff said his feeling were thatmany of the rising generation before him will liveuntil Christ comes in the clouds of Heaven. Hewanted to see the young people stop doing that whichis wrong and cultivate the Spirit of Prayer and feland qualify themselves for active service in theKingdom. The judgements of God are at our doors. 
 1889-09-15 Pres W. Woodruff, said whenever a watchman isset upon the tower of Zion and he does not givewarning when the enemy approaches he will be held toaccount. Joseph asked the Lord for wisdom and the Lordappeared to him, also His Son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smithwas ordained to introduce and lay the foundation of thisgreat and mighty work. After he received the manifestationswhich he had he would have been damned if he hadnot obeyed the voice of God. He had traveled hundredsof miles with and was well acquainted with the Prophet. This generation has a great debt to pay inshedding the blood of the Prophets. The Jews have had topay for shedding the blood of the Savior, they have beenin bondage in consequence for hundreds of years.Crime is largely on the increase. There is a thousandmurders today where there was one when the Book of Mormon was translated and other crimes haveincreased in like proportion. Testified that Godmoved upon Columbus to search out and open upthe way to this land. Washington was inspired to dohis work and the Declaration of Independence is aninspired document. He was sorry for this greatNation because it will cost them just as muchas any other nation who sheds the blood of theProphets. What will be the result of these persecutions?The judgements of God are ^and well be^ poured out upon theNations. He heard Joseph Smiths last speech beforehis martyrdom who sealed upon the Twelve allthe Keys and powers which he then held.Exhorted the Saints to be true and faithful totheir covenants. 
 1889-09-15Pres Woodruff said he was very thankful that hislife had been spared to attend the Dedication of anotherhouse for the worship of God.Father Adam before his death called together hissons and their posterity and gave them a Patriarchalblessing reaching down to the end of time.When we behold the many Temples and Tabernacleswhich have been erected for the worship of God inthe Latterdays it must be pleasing to Adam.These things are pleasing to all the Prophets who haveprophecied concerning the day in which we live.He was satisfied the Lord was pleased with it.Inasmuch as we keep the commandments of GodHis presense will be with us and His power attend us. This is the greatest of all dispensations the Lordhas given to man. We of all people have thegreatest cause to rejoice to think that we live in thisday. We will inherit the glory, the Law of which wekeep. Good and evil is set before us as with those ofour progenitors, and our free agency is given us thatwe may choose whom we will serve. We are alltempted and will be to the end of time. It willpay us to keep the commandments of God. Trustedthat we will be of one heart and mind while we are together. 
 1891-08-09 Pres W. Woodruff, fell thankful for the privilege ofmeeting with the L. D. S. in this Stake. Seek first theKingdom of God &c. The Prophets and Apostles in every age have been called to preach the Kingdomof God. They did not pay attention to what they shouldeat or drink or wear. It is so in this day. The Saints inthose days had the Holy Ghost so much so that theycould see the eternal reward for them which wasahead. They sealed their testimony with their blood.Our mission is to prepare the world for the secondcoming of our Saviour. We must not deviatefrom the way laid down by God through Hisservants. Referred to the establishment of the Gospelin the Sandwich Islands and Bro Cannons administrationhis faithfulness and integrity and the success whichhas crowned his labors. Our reward is not in thislife. He would like to live to see the Temple inSalt Lake City dedicated. Prayed God to bless the congregationand His work in all the world in the name of Jesus.

 TO THE SAINTS.MESSRS. TAYLOR & WOODRUFF:It has been so long since I addressed the saints through the medium of the Times andSeasons, that I feel confident that a few words from my pen, by way of advice, will be wellreceived, as well as a 'way mark' to guide the 'faithful' in future. I was sorry to learn, by your remarks upon the resolutions of the'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap-peared not long since, that any of the saints abroad were more apt to patronize the com-mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For the important reason, that the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto done, must continue to publish such portions of them for the benefit of the saints, and thesalvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from time to time, direct.Freedom is a sweet blessing; men have a right to take and read what papers they please:But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? It certainly is no more than just to suppose that 'charity begins at home,' and if so, what must such as profess to be saints think, when they patronize the splendor of Babylon, and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want of bread?Beside which, if virtue is justified rather than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula-ted to happify man, and dignify society, will, yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com-mandment, given anciently was, to love one another; even so, the works of the saints, at home and abroad, will bear its own testimony; whether they love the brethren.In all the world, the Times and Seasons]- is the only paper that virtually sustains, accord-ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy, 'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations—and what shall be said of him that is like the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the way. When we behold men who 'have borne the heat and the burden of the day;' strug-gled against the popular opinions of a vain world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false-hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil-ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help-ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con-tains the simple answer.Now let me say once for all, like the psalm-ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.'As the precious ointment upon the head,that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains 
 of Zion, is such unity—for there the Lord com-manded the blessing—life forever more! Unity is power, and when the brethren as one man,sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith, works, history, and progress of the church.—The brethren who conduct the paper have been appointed to that important station be-cause they are worthy and well qualified, and what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God and man is it, to see the charity of a brother support his brethren as an evidence that he means to pass from death into life?Many of the articles which appear in the Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations,translations, or are the united voice of confer-ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of silver,' are treasures more than meet for the called, chosen, and faithful among the saints; and should be more than drink to those that hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau-voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in circulation by the vigilance of the elders and saints—so as to be a herald of truth, and a standard of pure and undefiled religion. Fin-ally, men and brethren, when you support my friends, you support me.In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant, I am your humble servant, JOSEPH SMITH. 
 North Columbia Cal.Dec 5 [18]92Dear Uncle, Wilford Woodruff.Undoubt-edly you will be surprisedto receive a letter from meafter my long silence. I amnot real sure that I ans-wered your letter written aftermy father's death. Closelyupon my papa's death my strengthgave way from the severe strainand for a long time I wasmiserable to think ofwriting to any one. I droppedmy social correspondense, andhave never reopened all of it.Recently I heard througha friend of mine that another friend of mine in Nevada City Cal. 
 (a Mr. Searles, lawyer) had a picture of you in a bookof his, and that the picturelooked very much likemy father, so I thoughtmaybe you would send mea picture of yourself—aphotograph if you had oneto spare, if I wrote to youfor it.The Mr. Searles of whomI spoke above, is a son ofHon. Niles Searles, who was a delegate to Washington D. C. lastspring, to in behalf of themining interests of California.In your last letter tome and in fact, I think the only one I have ever receivedfrom you, you mentioned thefact of often passing throughColfax. Some time, don't you 
 think you could arrangeto run over to Nevada Cityand out to Columbia Hillfor a visit? We would be soglad to see you, I knowyou must have a great deal to occupy your time,and it is asking a gooddeal, to ask for a visit,but I hope some-day youcan come, if not for longerThis is our first pleasant day since Thanks-giving, and we enjoy thesun very much. Our wintersare not severely cold as a rule.This winter we have had agreat deal of rain. Duringthe month of November, 13.87 inthis for '92, during Nov. of 18911. and a few hundredths.That is quite a difference.

 Saint Louis October 22nd [18]56Bro WoodruffI wrote to you last from Westport Connecticut. I received nothingfrom Utah, by the September Mail.Elder Taylorfinished his narration, of the maytrdom of Joseph & Hyrum Smith. I do myself thecredit of thinking he never would haveaccomplished it, had I not remained withhim and kept his mind on the subject, as thereare many topics of exciting interest, whichdrew his attention. To edit the Mirmon aloneis abundant work for one man, and there aremany cares which necessarily surrond bro Taylorin other directions than editing the paper.I have preachedseveral times in Westport, Norwalk & neighbouringplaces. I took a violent cold, when thefall rain's commenced, it settled on my lungsand lasted three weeks. the weather has beenquite severe but is now mild and pleasant.On the morning of the 6th Octoberas I was coming from Chicago to this placein an express train, fifteen minutes before 3 O Clockit being very dark & foggy, we came in collision 
 with an express train from Alton, a generalruin was the immediate consequence, tho'miraculously no lives were lost, the brakemanhad both jaws broken, and his legs twice a piece,and one knee smashed up. A dutch doctor whowas a fellow passenger, trimmed off the smashedknee, set his other leg in two places ^&^ set hisjaws. we left him to recover if he could; aftera delay of 10 or 12 hours on the prariae, anotherTrain came along, and conveyed us on way rejoicingthat the accident was no worse.The is about 700Saints residing in St. Louis. they are principallyEuropean brethren working here to get a [fit out]they have rented the Methodist Church on4th Streat and have preaching three timesevery Sabbath. A considerable number of strangersattend on the Sabbath evenings, and appear togive good attention.Elder Snows health hasbeen poor since I have been here. he negotiateddrafts drawn by Elder Spencer on the LiverpoolOffice to the amount of some 4 or 5 thousand poundsfor the benefit of the Emigration fund. thesedrafts have been protested by Bro Pratt fornonpayment, and the long list of forfeitures,damages, [duns], and the devil know's what, whichare the result of such a transaction, have a tenden[cy] 
 to keep down his Spirits, producing in my minda visible effect upon his health, which isat best rather poor. theserough these circum-stances, he has not yet been enabled to republishthe Luminary. Bro Snow has been ^is^ borrowingsmall sums of money wherever he can, in orderto pacify these claimants. He has sentElder Coward to England, to try and effectsome arrangements, to meet these drafts, theerror appears to have been committed, througha misunderstanding of Bro Spencer, as to theamount of funds, the Liverpool Office had todispose of, had thy matter been understoodas it really was, the drafts might have beendisposed of at 90 days sight, ^or longer^ and have arvidedthe forfeitures per cent, damages, loss of credit, andcaused annoyances, growing out of a return ofprotested paper.The recent State Electionsin Pensylvania & Indiana, show favorablefor the election of Buchannan, should Fillmorecarry a few Southern States, it may go to theHouse. The know nothing and Democrat paperspronounce Freemont's cake to be dough, ashe could not be possibly be elected, withoutIndiana or Pensylvania, as no Slave State will go for him. Sixteen Democratic membersof Congress have been returned from Pensylvania 
 which show, that the Douglas doctrinethe non intervention, in the domestic affairsof Territories, is rather on the gain, inthe Keystone State, there being only 6at the last election.Please call and seemy wife and children and give thema good word of advice.

 Portland Jany. 16th. 1856Dear Brother & SisterReally after so long atime I recd a letter from brother Wilford to dayvia California. a long wait and a long time coming.I was very glad to hear from you and that youare all so well. If for the best, hope your cropsmay be better another year. should they find youare a long ways from a market. How pleasantit must be for you to have such fine fruit as you raise there, and you must know how to appreciatehaving been deprived of it so long. I should likevery much to have a few of your fine peachesand grapes when ripe. The crops with us the past season were very abundant, probablynever more than two thirds as much ever raisedin one year as there was the last year and stillprevious one high owing in part to the trouble inEurope, which continues, but we hope there issome prospect of peace. If the money that has been expended to distroy people there, had beenused for the purchase of Bibles to distribute withthe destituate, there would be less human misery thenthere is now, no doubt. The end is not yetEngland and France may get into a quarrel,and if so the result will be disastrous. thepride of those nations are is so great, that neitherof them would be willing to yield --

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP. O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dec. 18, 1895.Prest. James E Steele,Bingham Stake.Dear Brother:At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, and their associate officers, and all whom they may concern:There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes of Zion, of High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization distinct from that of the Teachers' Quorum and being presided over by a president and two counselors.  The tendency of such organizations has been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted, was, Is it proper for such organizations to exist, or to be presided over in this manner? The Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church government;  neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that the brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers, should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well-being of the ward. 
 The second question was: At which of the meetings of the saints should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession –-at the general meeting of the members of the ward, at the fast meeting, or the monthly priesthood meeting? It was the mind of the Council that the regulations of confessions in such cases should be left to the Bishopric of the ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the pub-licity which has been given to it. For instance, whr^e^re people guilty of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their transgression is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public. But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a stll more public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession shall be made at the monthly fast meeting (which meetings are attended almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.The object of this restriction is to confine the confession as much as possible to the circrle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation, which says (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world."As a rule, therefore, where the transgression is known to but a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more public confession be required.We are, Your Brethren,Wilford Woodruff,Geo. Q. CanonJos. F. Smith
