Salt Lake City Oct. 31st 1881    Pres. W. Woodruff—St. George—    Dear Brother:    Your letter of 27th inst. from Nephi,  "desiring my attendance" at the Conference of the Y. M. M.  I. Associations at Ogden on Sunday last, came duly to  hand. Agreeable to your request I made arrangements  for Bros. D. B. Wells and C. W. Penrose to attend the Tooele Con-  ference, and I went to Ogden and attended the young  peoples Conference. There was a large attendance, the  house being completely filled. We had a very interesting  time so far as the meetings were concerned. The morning  was occupied by reports and short lectures from  various young men, on the subjects of the "Organiza-  tion of the Church," "The Miracles of Jesus," "The Constitu-  tion of the U. S." and the "Divine origin of the Book of Morm-  on." The afternoon was occupied by administering  the Sacrement, sustaining the authorities of the Associ  ations, and a discourse by myself. So far so  good, and I think you will accord with me  in this, but now comes the subject which is the cause 
 [upside-down text] See "Suggestions of the Apostles." &c. Contributor, of May 1880—page  191. [end of upside-down text]    of this writing. In your letter of instructions you say, "I think  it desirable if you could consult with the Presidency of   the Stake and appoint a good man, one that would  meet with the approval of the Societies and be sustained  by them to fill the position" vacated by Jos. A. West. Agreeable  to this instruction I "consulted with the Presidency," and to my  surprise and disappointment I found they were not united  and had never consulted together on this subject. The  counsellors claimed that they had been ignored and slighted  and the feeling ran high, and extended back to times past and  other things. I found it impossible to reconcile them or to come  to any agreement in the time which we had, and the only thing  I could do was to propose a postponement of the consideration  of the subject until some future time. Bro. Peery was eager for  me to make the nomination myself and put it through. This I  considered unreasonable and unfair besides being entirely  opposed to the written instructions on this point, so I ref-  used to do it. And told him I did not propose to carry his  burdens for him. The instructions upon this matter, so far as  I can recall them to memory ^is^ for the "Presidency of the Stake  to appoint the Stake Presidents of the Associations subject  to the approval of the High Council." ^&c.^ This had not been done  I therefore declined to do anything in the premises, and ad-  vised the Presidency to go to work and carry out this rule.    With very kind regards to yourself, Prests. Taylor, Cannon  and all the company I am your bro. in the Gospel Jos. F. Smith 
 P.O. Box 2270    Morris M. Estee  Attorney and Counsellor at Law   419 California Street    San Francisco, March 2nd, 1897    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    My dear Mr. Woodruff:    I write to congratulate you on your   reaching the advanced age of ninety years. Few men have lived as long   as you, fewer still have experienced as much.

[upside-down text]  (Our reporter has made Applycation to publish it in pamphlet form)  [end of upside-down text]    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother:    I have, in connection with thousands of the   Latter-day Saints, read with great delight your   discourse delivered at the Weber Stake Conference,   Ogden, October 19, 1896, and published in the Deseret   Semi-Weekly News of November 3, last.  For some   time after its publication your discourse was the   chief topic of conversation among the Saints; it   was also read in some of the ward meetings.    Many with whom I conversed upon the subject ex-  pressed a desire to see the discourse printed   in pamphlet form, that they might be the better   able to preserve it.  Now, my object in writing   is to ascertain if you would have any objection to   your discourse being printed in a neat,   pamphlet form, exactly as it appeared in the   Deseret Semi-Weekly News.  If not, it would give   me pleasure to print the pamphlet.    Awaiting your reply, I remain, dear Brother,  your fellow-servant in the Gospel of Christ    William A. Morton.    278 C.

 April 18th 1845, 36 Chapel Street Liverpool    Father & Mother Woodruff    Having an opportunity  of Forwarding a letter by private conveyance  to the United States by an Elder who is about to  Sail to Boston, I thought I would drop a few  lines to you, to let you know that we are in  the land of the living & in the enjoyment of good  health. I have felt vary anxious to hear from  you since we have been here but have not as  yet herd a word from you or about you since  we left New York and at that time you was in  sumthing of an unsettled state in your temporal  affairs, I suppose you would like to know sumthing  what I am doing in this Land. I will therefore say  that I have had more business on hand since my arival  here than at any one time During life I found the  Saints needed in much council & many after alterations through  various portions of the British dominions. I have taken  a tour through Scotland & a part of England since  I came I have held many conferences since I came  we held our general conference at Manchester on  6th April it lasted th[r]ee & a half days & more business  done than ever before in any one conference in England  their was represented on that occasion ten thousand saints  save 90, in England, Scotland, Ireland & Wales & incliding  their families would probably amount to 30,000 souls    We had a large congregation to leav these chirches represe-  nted, & [illegible] the business of leaving the churches represented,  & appointing the Elders to take charge of them and attending to the  business that necessarily has to be done at such conferences    We established a joint stock company for the purpose  of Establishing manufactories in Nauvoo the whole stock 
 is divided into sixty thousand stores making a Capitol  of one hundred & fifty thousand Dollars the way the stores  are now selling it will be but a little time before the Stock  will be taken up. This will be a great help in building up  Nauvoo in esstablishing business in cotton & wool & iron  trade & employing the poor in that place, we had done  this in order to [concentrate] the wealth through & union of  the Saints in this land with the Saints in America, save  one taking as high as 100 Stores, I have just received letters &  papers from Nauvoo all bearing good News they have commanced  building the dam on the Mississippi River I am con[?] on  the Emigration Business, printing, Temple Tything, & Having the  presidency of the ten thousand Saints gives me a plenty of suply    I am now providing 3000 Doctrine & Covenenants which  will readily sell as soon as out of press as their is great  call for them in this land, we shall emigrate the families  via New York & Boston During the summer months  I have not yet received any letters from Br Webster nor heard  from him ownly as I see his name in the Neighbor as  a letter from Father Carter a few days since who informed me  that they were all ^well^ that Sister Foss family who were so very  sick when we were there had all got well again, & our  little Phebe was very well, I was glad to hear from  them. My health is very good, which is the case with  our home though I have heard some time I came I  have had one journey through Scotland & I intend to visit  London & France soon, But among the Signs of the times  a dark war cloud is appearing over England & America there  has never appeared as great a project for it is believed the  two countries since peace was proclaimed as at the present  time. Sir Robert Peel has taken a strong stance against Mr.   Polk speach on the Oregon question. Either Sir Robert Peel  or Mr. Polk must recall what they have said or at least  not attempt to carry their missions into operation if no 
 their will assuredly be war, & knowing the minds of both  governments I do not believe they will either of them yield  the point, great excitement prevails here upon the subject.  England is making great preparation for it 16,000 troops have  been ordered to embark for Canida. As I was coming home  from the office to day I saw hand Bills through the street  headed in large letters War War with America the  last steem ship was Delaid by parliment to take  a messenger from London to Washington. I expect it  will be decided I expect in a short time, if war is  proclaimed I shall probably leave for America. I believe  the day is not far Distant when the American people will  have sumthing to do besides fighting the Latter Day Saints  I believe the Nation is rife for judgment & a Scourge awaits  her. Please write me a letter as soon as you get this &  tell me how things are with you how you get along & all the  news will you [torn page] And any Newes you may have from Br[other] [torn page]  Webster & family Azmon & family, Thompson, Br[other] [Ozam] & fa[mily] [torn page]  Sister Cossett & Betsey, or any other friends I would be glad to [hear] [torn page]  from give my respects to all who inquire after me  I felt anxious to learn from Father Woodruff in consquence  of some dreams I had about him I was afraid he was sick  or in some trouble. As to myself I all still a [illegible]  as it were in Mormonism for it is my life meet & drink and  I do not expect to be any thing els but a Mormon  either in life or Death. I have never felt as great a  responsibility resting upon me as at the present time  and when I consider it it certainly looks like a marvelous  work & a wonder that an obscure unlearned Miller should  stand in England at the head of ten thousand saints, chartering  Ships to gather them to this land of Zion establishing printing presses  forming a company with a capitol of $150,000, dollars to build  up Nauvoo I truly feel the saying a prophet is not without honor  save his own country but it is of the Lord & not of man & to  him be the glory. Regards with respect W. Woodruff 
 give my respects to Thompson if you see him. I hope   I may be permitted to again behold your faces again   in the flesh if the Lord will.

DIRECTORS:  Geo. Q. Cannon,  Jos. F. Smith,  H. J. Grant,  John Sharp,  W. H. Rowe,  J. R. Winder,  H. Dinwoodey,  P. T. Farnsworth,  J. R. Barnes,  G. Romney,  T. W. Jennings.    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MARCH 16, 1891.    TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ZION'S CO-OPERATIVE MERCANTILE INSTITUTION:    The increase of trade and demand made upon the Institution  by some of its best customers for accommodation, convinces us that  our capital of $1,000,000 is inadequate to transact the large  business of almost $4,000,000 per annum that the Institution is  now doing; particularly when it is remembered that upon some lines  of goods we have to give four months' time after the goods have   arrived here and been sold.    At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on the 15th of   February, the subject of increasing the Capital Stock was referred  to a special committee who have reported, recommending that the  Capital be increased 2,500 shares, and that $135 per share be  charged for this increase, $100 of which will be credited to Cap-  ital Stock account, and the remaining $35 to Reserve Fund, so as   to place the new stock exactly on a par with the old, so far as  reserves are concerned.    In our showing just made of the assets and liabilities of  the Institution, it will be seen that we have a Reserve Fund of   $350,000, to say nothing of the extremely low valuation placed  upon real estate and buildings and on our stock of merchandise;  so I have no hesitation in saying that at $135 per share, it is  under rather than over the actual value of the Stock. Our showing  for the past year is a good one, as good as any we have heretofore   made, and we have every reason to believe that we shall continue  to do a large and prosperous business, and I see no cause why we  should not be able to pay as good dividends as we have heretofore  done, after this increase has been added to the Capital Stock.  It is proposed to allot this Capital Stock pro rata to our present  stockholders in the proportion of 25 per cent of their present  holdings, but no subscription will be received for fractional parts  of a share, excepting from such as now own a fraction and desire  to make up a full share.    A circular has been prepared, which I have pleasure in  enclosing with this, upon which stockholders will kindly notify  the Secretary of the Institution whether they wish to subscribe  and take ths additional stock or otherwise. It is important that  the matter should be attended to by the stockholders as early as  possible and the notification returned without delay. The new  Stock must be paid for to the Treasurer of the Institution, one-  half on or before May 1st, and the balance on or before Aug. 1st,  1891.    Respectfully,    Wilford Woodruff  President.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P.O. Box B.    Salt Lake City, Utah, August 23, 1895.    Prest. James E. Steele and Couselors,  Presidency Bingham Stake. of Zion,    Dear Brethren:    Since the visit of Bro. Steele to this city we have   further considered the question of laocation of headquarters of your   stake, and have fully concluded, after conferring with Elder John Henry   Smith who figured prominently in its organization, that Iona is in   every way and the most proper as well as perhaps the most suitable place for   headquarters, it not only being the residence of the stake presidency,   but is also quite centrally located. We therefore recommend that the   people one and all regard Iona as headquarters of your stake.    As a stake organization you are starting out with the very   best of prospects. You have a remarkably good country, both healthful   and fruitful, with an abundant supply of water and singularly well   adapted to stockraising as well as agriculture. With industry, so char-  acteristic of our people, coupled with intelligent management, and   accompanied by the blessing of God, prosperity must necessarily attend   your labors. We look for and expect prosperity to come to Zion in   fulfillment of the promises of the Lord; but we are not unmindful of the   fact that with prosperity come temptations, and too often evilas, which   render the latter state of a people worse than the first. As we have   learned to rejoice and acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the days of   our poverty we certaihnly should be able to acknowledge his hand in times   of prosperity; but this we can only do by being prepared to successfully   meet any new conditions which a favorable change in our temporal 
 with all Church business as far as they have the power   again I do not see how any Latter Day Saint can vote   or hold office under that Law it throws off our   property vote then lends to tax as High as they please   with no one to say why do you so however I hope   for the best & trust in God but it looks to me   as though it were going to work Great Hardships to   the Saints I was afraid that we were going to loose   Sister Cottam but I am thankful to say she   has revived & is getting Better but Brother Cottam   is getting worse He has 2 fits in 3 days, was overcome  overcome in her sickness and it came near mak-  ing letter Thompson sick as the Heft of the Brethren  came upon her Brother Thompson sent his Horse   on a 4 days Journey to get another I expect to returne to   the templ tomorow or as soon as his horse comes   & stopt there untill the xxx is done then I shall   returne to my abode I was in Arizona a few   days since within 3 Miles of the spring. I expect to list   it soon after & return I rather think I shall   spend a Hermit Summer there as the water is   cold & plenty of shade I shall not be entirely done   but I shall have more of my own family one at  least I would like to have to keep me company   awhile but I not do the best I can God Bless you  Broth. & Sister A & all the family send love Br A. son   & wife are now playing on the organ & singing Hard times come again   No More But I dont think they have quite eroded My love   to all the family As ever yours L A 
 circumstances may bring upon us. As leaders among the people, these   two thoughts should be uppermost in your minds: The salvation of souls,   and the building up of Zion. If you yourselves have these desires   burining within you, you will be able to imbue your bishops and ^[their]^ coun-  selors with the same feelings; and if you as a body of presiding priest-  hood are united in your labors to this end you will have the power to   draw the people to you and guide them in the paths of righteousness; and   the evil one, who is ever on the alert to make inroads among the saints,   will not have power to divide or make headway against you. Without   being rigid or arbitrary you should make it a point to maintain, through   the co-operation of the general priesthood, as well as that of your   presiding officers, the discipline of the church, as this is the means   by which the saints are preserved from the wiles of the adversary. YThe   morals of the people should be jealously guarded, and the name of God   should not be used in vain. These two things we would especially have   you impress upon your young men. And if, in the course of events, fdiffi-  culties arise among brethren, we hope they will make it a point to   settle the same in an amicable way without resorting to tribunals either   of the Church or State; and if possible to not let the sun go down   upon their wrath.    Living, as many of the brethren do live, upon their farms   at long distances from each other and from houses of public worship, they   are necessarily deprived more or less of that education which is derived   from association afforded by settlement and town life. We trust that   the brethren so situated will, with their families, not fall into the   habit of working on Sundays; but that they will keep holy the Sabbath   day as we are commanded to do, and make it a point to attend meetings   and Sunday school.    It is very important that your ward records be well kept, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, August 3, 1888.    Elder John Steele,  Toquerville.    Dear Brother:    Your very interesting favor of the 30th. of July has  been received and read with great pleasure.    Yours has been indeed a pioneer and a busy life, and  you are in a position now to give much valuable counsel to the rising generation,  and to describe to them the hardships and privations and the shifts which the  settlers of this country had to contend with and to resort to in the beginning.  A new generation is now upon the scene, and though they hear occasionally con-  cerning the work of the pioneers and the difficulties they had to contend with,  still, in this city particularly, their ideas are exceedingly vague respecting  these matters, and the men and women who can give them information from their  personal experiences are fast passing away. There are really but few left.    I am glad that you have mentioned the birth of your   daughter; for there is another claimant for the honor of being the first white  child born in the Valley after the arrival of the Pioneers. As I now remember 
 the date of his birth as it was announced, your daughter was born before he was.  I think I shall have your letter published in the Deseret News, as it contains  a number of interesting items that are worthy of preservation.    I am glad to hear from you that you are enjoying your-  self so well, and that your heart still beats with the love of Zion and the  desire to see the Kingdom of God more widely spread and established. That you  may live very many years yet to see the fruits of your labors and the increase  of righteousness in the earth, is my earnest desire.    With kind regards, I am,  Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 that proper care be taken of them as they become filled up, for future   generations will highly prize and make good use of them.    In the erection of public buildings the greatest wisdom should   be exercised. They are public property and should, therefore, reflect   the general intelligence and tatste of the people, and we hope that due   regard will be shown in the beauty of their design, ventilation, &c., by   obtaining the best available architectural ability in the preparation   of the plans. And we may add in this connection, that whatever you may   undertake in the way of erecting public buildings, invlolving a consider-  able expenditure of means, should be done as much as possible within   your own resources, and not with the expectation that the Church may be   relied upon to make up deficiencies. Some of our stake and ward   officers have of late found themselves in the exceedingly unpleasant   position of being totally unable to meet public obligations contracted   by them without our knowledge or consent, ^and for the payment of which they themselves were held individually ^responsible;^^ and they have appealed to us   to help them to preserve their credit and maintain their financial honor,   while at the same time we were over-burdened ourselves. We have felt   that if brethren look to us for help for such purposes, they should   consult us before they involve themselves, and thus afford us an oppor-  tunity of conferring with them as to the advisbability of such undertak-  ings; otherwise they should depend wholly on their own resources. In   most of the stakes there is what is called a stake meeting house, a   building erected by the stake as a whole, which answers a good and   worthy purpose in the rich and populous stakes; but in newly organized   and sparsely settled stakes such a large central building it would not   be advisable to undertake to erect. We advise rather the erection of   commodious ward meeting houses and good boweries, so that stake con-  ferences acan be taken to the people, so to speak; that is, they can be   held in the wards with bowery accommodations in the summer season, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE   CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.   OF   LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. May 9th, 1889.    Elder John Steele,    Toquerville.    Dear Brother: Your letter of May 5th has been received, in which you   set forth the expressed wishes of your sister, made before her death and after your   explaining to her the true order of marriage and of adoption of her children, to be   sealed to you for eternity, instead of to her husband; and if that was not ad-  missible, that she be sealed to your son, M. M. Steele. You also rsay "I told her I   did not know how that would be; such things had been done, but I did not know how   it would be again."    Of course, I am not econversant with what information you may have on   this subject; but I am not aware of any such sealings or adoptions in this Church.   I do not consider it proper for any such sealings or adoptions to be administered in   the Temples of the Lord. It is not any more proper for your sister to be sealed to   you as her husband, now that she is dead, than it would be if she were alive;   neither should she be sealed to your son, because such a marriage is too near of 
 kin.    If your sister, while alive, did not feel that she wished to be sealed   to her living husband for eternity, and if she did not express any preference on   that matter other than the ones you mention, you should then make a choice in her   behalf, and have her sealed to some faithful man in the Church, either living or   dead, and have her children adopted into his family.    Trusting this will be satisfactory to you,    I remain your brother,    W Woodruff 
 the ward meeting houses in the cold weather. We believe, too, the   results will be altogether better by distributing the conferences in   this way than by holding them all the time at one place; and, besides,   the investment involved in one large central building would be spared to   you.    Before closing our communication we feel to add a few words   in regard to politics. You are doubtless already aware of the counsel   given to the presiding priesthood at the meeting held in October 1893   on this subject, and therefore all that we now need to say is that the   time which has expired since then has only gone to prove the wisdom of   the policy adopted by us on that occasion. It is true that some of our   brethren from a restless desire to do something for their party have   failed to strictly carry out the counsel given at the meeting referred   to; but it is a noteworthy fact that wherever this has been the case   the results have been anything but satisfactory. We mention this for   the purpose of reminding you that as a stake presidency or as individuals   you have no place whatever in the field of active politics unless there   be good and sufficient reasons to the contrary. In starting out in the   labors of your official career it is of the utmost importance that you   maintain the dignity of your high calling, and that your minds be free   from bias of every description; and this we are sure will be the case  inasmuch as you seek earnestly to the Lord to know and carry out his   will. In this connection it may be interesting to quote to you one of   the significant sayings of the Prophet Joseph. There are three agents,   he taught us, at work on the earth—the Spirit of God, the spirit of   man, and the spirit of the Evil One. Brethren in the days of the   Prophet were deceived, and brethren all along the line since his day   have been deceived, and doubtless brethren will yet be deceived as   between the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, simply because they   have sought to carry out their own will and way, and to minister to 
 their o[w]n personal ambitions and selfish desires rather than to be   servants of God and shpepherds of his sheep. As long as you labor   unselfishly for Zion, for the blessing and uplifting of the people whom   God has called you to preside over, you will be entitled to His Spirit   to inspire and guide you in all your labors, and you will never be   found at a loss to distinguish between that Spirit which emanates from   God, and that spirit whixch has its source in man. We feel to say this to   you for the reason that whatever influence and power you may possess as   a presidency or as individuals are given to you of the Lord; and as God   our Father is a jealous God, so it becomes us his servants, in whiom he ha^s^   reposed a great and important trust, to be jealous also, that is, jealous   that all the power which comes from him to us, and through us to our   fellow servants, is used to his honor and to his glory, for the   building up of Zion, and the slalvation of our brethren and sisters.    Whenever you or either of you, come to the city we shall   be pleased to see you, and shall be glad to hear from you at any time on   any and all important mantters pertaining to the government of your stake.    Praying the Lord to give you every needed blessing, we are, with kind   regards,    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon

 City of Nauvoo  January 27th 1845    Bro, W. Woodruff    We take the Earliest opportunity to   address a few lines to you, to make you acquainted with   the proceedings of the Legislators of the State of Illinois.  Since they assembled in council in the City of   Springfield, there has been no business of any   importance transacted for the benefit and welfare   of the citizens of said State, but on the other hand   they have been continually debating and discussing   upon the Charter of the City of Nauvoo, and   the latest intelligence which we have received from   Springfield is that they have repealed the City Charter   also, the Legion Charter, but you know, we care   nothing about it for them that would kill the   prophets, would also take away our charter, but   they are only filling the cup of their damnation the more   which will send them to Hell, and that seems to be   the place for them any how, for their works do prove  it to a demonstration, they have passed judgment   upon an innocent people as a community, but glory to   God the day is not far distant when they shall be   caught in a straight, & the measure which they meted   to us shall be meted to them two fold and running over.    We shall appeal right off and continue   to do so, until it goes to the Federal court of the   United States, and if it so be that it should also   pass there, we hope and trust by that time we   shall have accomplished all that the God of 
 heaven designs for this place, and we ask no favors   of them, for they are poor miserable creatures at the   best.    The carpenters have erected a work shop on   the South side of the Temple where they are busily   employed preparing the materials for the inside of the   building, the three story of the Temple walls are up and   archerd over except six—and in the course of 4 weeks   from this time if the weather is favorable all the cut   stone will be ready to lay upon the walls thereof   and of course it will not take long to put them on—&   afterwards the roof; and thence we will finish one   room alternately till the whole is accomplished    The baptismal Font which was constructed of   wood is taken away, and we are going to build ^one^ of stone   all hewn and nicely cut, allso the twelve oxen will be cast   of iron, or brass, or hewn stone    The Saints here are firm and united in the   bonds of love, and they are rejoicing in the blessings  of the new and everlasting covenant, and although   ^the Saints^ has had to endure much, and suffer many inconveniences   passed through many hardships and privations, they   feel to put their trust in the living God who sits  enthroned in the Heavens above, and rules the armies   of Israel, also, they are anxious to ascertain and know   the things which do immediately concern their salvation  both temporal and Spiritual; a greater union never   has exsisted in the bosom of the Saints, than what   there is at present time, they wfeel to be docile  humble and Submissive to the powers that be, and to   Sustain, ^&^ uphold the Twelve apostles of the Lamb,  and go according to their council. 
 We received your letters that you wrote before you sailed and   feel that they were dictated by the spirit and may the Lord bless you, and   your family, give my best respects to Bro Hedlock, Bro & Sister Clark, Bro Ward  and all the Saints, you had better keep Bro Hedlock with you till next   fall, or, just as you and him will feel it for the best; We have just   received returns from Bro Hedlock by Bro Benson, he stopp'd at Alton   but we got Bro Orson Hyde to go down to St Louis and get what was  sent by Bro Benson, but I did not receive a scratch of a pen from Bro  Hedlock, his wife has received the little present he sent her, they are   all well, we shall propably send you some Elders next spring to assit   you, so that you and Bro Hedlock and Clark can attend pretty much   to the tithing, emigration business, and the printing, the tide of emigration   we expect now will be turned mostly to New York, so that the poor   Saints who have been brought up in factories, can go into these factory   towns in the Eastern States, get work and help themselves, so that  they can obtain homes when they come up West, and all the time be   a healthy country, still those that wish to come to New Orleans in the   proper season of the year we have no objection.    Bro Woodruff if you are obliged to send the poor here, [page torn]   cannot pay their passage, but you have to pay it for them, let them   leave something in pledge, but you know what my council was to you   before you left, that w in all propability by next December we shall  be given the Saints their endowments, we are calling in the Elders to   assist us this Spring and Summer, but you shall be blest in the name   of the Lord, for I say so and all the rest of the brethren    We remain  Your brethren in the firm  bonds of the N. & E.

 Portland Dec. 10th, 53    Bro. W.    Your favor of the 1st Nov. is recd  We have received nothing from Horner nor   heard any thing from his wife or friends at   St Josephs and I fear  that his statements   to you are entirely false.  If it is possible   to get any thing from him there or to secure   yourself in any way I think it would be   well to do so.  Would not Brother Little in   trust himself somewhat, for I think he   had his friends & Mr. Cowards also.    I shall write N & Riley to night &   Mr. H. and see what kind of a story they   tell about the affair.    You do not think well of driving   stock across the plains next Season by   what I have heard, I am of your opinion.    The merchandise business looks well at  your place but as I am situated at pres  ent hardly done to engage in it.  there are   persons who I presume are watching every  movement I make,  and at present I   cannot afford to stand much of a oss.

 having that in view think it would not   be advisable to engage in that trade this   season. I am tired and most worn out   with those old affairs and feel a great  anxiety to dispose of them & hope I may be   able to do so this comeing year.    You sold those grocries remarkably well   they paid a large profit. As to Books and   stationary I do not now who to send to   or who would take charge of them across the   plains, they might go & then again they might   not. I see by the Bugle that Kemesville is   mostly destroyed by fire and many goods   burnt up.  If you send an order for anything   with directions for forwarding in season to go   out this comeing spring I shall be most   happy to attend to it for you as you may   direct, but as I am situated here in the   east I have not the slightest idea of   who is intending to cross the plains or what   arrangements are making for it.    I feel under great obligations to you for   your promptness and punctuality in our   affairs and hope all will result well   it looks a little unfavorable as to Horner  I cannot credit a word he has told you   & if there is any possible way of collecting it   of him I should do it if I was in your place.

Mrs. Carters health is not very good,  about the same as usual. Father continues smart.    No news of much interest, aside from strange  political and theological proceedings these days  things are in strange confusion in this country, what   the result may be remains to be determined.

She has been very low and suf-  fered a great deal. Luther has been much   afflicted with a fellin on one of his fingers,  has had his finger taken off twice, or a part   of it at a time, it is now getting better.  Rhoda has been ill so long that the old   Lady Ms. Scammons became quite exhausted,  and has died. We hope that Ms. S. from   present appearances will recover.    No news of interest, with us. We have a   report this morning that France and England   have made a final declaration of war   against Russia, and the prospect is that there   will be much blood shed, "the end is not   yet", what the result will be remains to be   determined.

 Portland March 15th, 54.    Brother Wilford    Your favor of Jany. 1st  containing Draft on M. J. N. B. was recd  to day. Came through expiditiously for the season  of the year. I do not hear a word from Huner  or any of his friends, not one cent of the money  you sent last year by him has been forwarded  I think that under the circumstance you was  very successful indeed in securing that  and in my opinion it was the best and only  course to take with him to save it, to drive  him right into it, after the principle is paid  should he not pay the interest? I had no  confidence in his former statements to you  and I suppose he would liked to have put you  off until he could have got away. I really  desire to feel thankful that it is in so good   a shape. As you remark about business, we  hardly know what a day may bring forth. I  feel that it is very true matters are very fluc  tuating here. I am still in Portland and as  much unsettled as I have ever been, which  is indeed unpleasant. I am hoping that there  will be some change for the better, in old  affairs still drag along, but I hope we shall dispose 
 Portland May 15th, [18]54    Brother Wilford    I have just redd your two   last letters, March 1st & April 1st, one con-  taining a Draft, for 70$ & the other advising me  of something sent by Brother Stewart which I will  recpt. to you for as soon as recd Mr Bernhisel  has not yet paid that Draft, I have nothing further  from him. I wrote Mr Hunce & James as you  directed some time since at St. Josephs, as   yet I hear nothing from there. had they been   prompt in remitting I should have heard from  them two months since. it begins to look bad  again. I think from his conduct it would be  well for you to secure that at your place if  you possibly can. I recd the Des. News of March 15  which I found very interesting. I send you papers  frequently, do you get them? I have been waiting  some time to hear from Hunce, the statement you  sent me of the groceries I have also mislaid  and for those reasons I have not been able to  tell the just amount to put in the note. I have  intended to recpt. to you for all money recd  and have a particular account of it and will  enclose the amount in the Note after deducting

Bernhisel was forwarded to him   by us when received, for acceptance, which   he refused to do stating that he was not   in possession of funds that would warrant   his doing it, but thought he might have   some by & by that would enable him to pay it.    We then wrote him proposing that he might   make it payable a few months hence if he   would accept it, to prevent its being protested,   as a protest would be attended with some   inconvenience and expense, that he also   declined, and so the matter rests, we   still hold the Draft, what shall we do with it?    Upon the recept. if your letter informing   me of Mr Horners comeing to the States I wrote   him and the other man at once directing   them how to forward the funds, as yet I   have not heard a word from one of them.    Horner seems to be a great scamp, if he   has anything there that you can get hold of   I think I should do it to the amount of the 
 principle and interest, if he has had that   money in his possession for a year and a   half or so, I see no reason why he should  not pay the interest on it, had it been   forwarded as per agreement the interest on  it to us would have amounted to quite a   sum. I merely state that, and leave it   with you to arrange just as you may think   best and proper. A man that has treated   you as Horner has, certainly has not much   claim to your sympathies to the extent of   justice and right.    We have no news of much interest   all quite well, have not heard from   Mrs. Scammons for two or three weeks, at last   accounts she was very low, the old Lady   Mrs. Sally Scammons was dead.

Many  things that I saw there I highly approve of  and sure I know nothing of. I feel very thank-  ful that the ordinance of baptism was adminis-  tered to me and I thank you very muchkindly for the  interest you manifested for my spiritual wel  fare. By the mercies of God I was spared to return  to my family for which I hope I feel very thankful    I have been stopping here for a few weeks  first with S & C, think I shall engage in the  Express business soon, if so my family will  come to the city and perhaps Freedom and  family will go to Scarbor[ough]. This is a world of  change you perceive and hope this will be for  the better. for all interested S. is a dull place  for mye and my family.

 Portland Sept. 5th, [18]53    Brother Wilford    I shall expect in the course   of five or six days to receive letters from July   your mail of Aug. 1st and shall probably have   occasion to write you in reply. My object of writing   at this time is to make enquiries, what the pros  pect is for a market at your place for stock   next spring or summer. I should not want   to make an investment unless the prospect was   particulary favorable of its proving profitable  I have no money that I can afford to loose   yet I am desirous of making an effort to get rid   of my old liabilities. I have carriaid that   load until I am nearly exhausted, and now   feel as though I would make one more ef-  fort to make something to help me out of the   difficulty. I should not feel like starting with   a share of cattle to drive through to California   but I could go to your place I think (by the as-  sistance of Providence) very comfortably and safely    I have been on the Humbolt once and   that is about as much as I desire. If any of   you folks who are responsible that are doing a   California business would purchase three hundred   head of stock such as would be desired for that   market. I should like to drive to Salt Lake   next spring that number, is thereabouts—    [upside-down text] We recd a letter from Middleton & [Riz] St Josephs a few  days since, they say that they knew nothing about this affair of   [Himas], that they knew him well & had confidence in him.

 I hope Reese & Co. will pay the balance  due on those bonds at once (an account of which I  gave you after my return) so that you will be  able to forward it when you next remit.    Should something favorable occur so that you  could remit a considerable portion of that amount  in the Spring it would be most acceptible  to me and would perhaps enable me to  get relieved of this most uncomfortable and  oppressive burden under which I have been  toiling and labouring for a long time.    We have nothing new of interest to  communicate. Do please write often for we feel  anxious to hear from you by every mail. Anna Carter  recd a letter from Sarah E. Foss but by some of  your friends to St. Louis "I did not receive mine"  I have no doubt you wrote me.    Please remember me very kindly to Ms Foss  and family (us, Ms. C, and myself I should have  said), to our mutual friend Sister Whitaker  in whom we feel much interest and to all  our friends generally.    Hoping that God will guide and direct  you and yours in all things and that we may so  live that we may obtain that [course] of life  hereafter is the prayer of    Very truly Your Brother  Ilus. 
 [Give] see and know and I think can appreciate   to some extent my situation. Now if I can   engage in that thing with good prospect of a   profitable opperation I should like to do so   and unless it looked very favorable indeed,   it would not answer for me to take the risk  in my present dilapidated situation.    I will ask the favour of you to investigate   the matter and write me by the first mail.    We have nothing new of interest, matters   move in much the same as usual, business   is rather dull, generally. We are all about   as well as usual. Mother has been poorly for   the past two or three months but we think she   is a little better now. Father is smart, he   goes to Concord this week to visit his friends  he recd a letter and paper a few days since   from Salt Lake but, across by one of the mission-  aries. E. and family are well. Mr. and Mrs.  W. Woodruff were announced in one of the   Boston papers amoung the arrivals from Utah,   (as a part of the companies of missionaries) I have   not yet seen them here and think of course it   was a mistake. If I can attend to anything for you   here please inform me and I will be most   happy to do it for you. Please remember me   very kindly to Mrs. W. and family and all our friends,  that heavens choicist and finest blessings may be on you  and your dear family is the prayer of, yours truly Ilus.

I sincerely regret to inform  you that it will not be in my power  to meet the draft in favor of Sanborn and   Carter at present, but I hope to be able   to do so in the course of three or four   months.    The saddle, bridle, and martingale   cost either sixteen or seventeen dollars   in Saint Louis, I am not quite sure which.  Therefore we cannot sell the saddle for   $15 dollors, but you may sell them   for what may be considered a fair price.    Please sell the arsenic if it can be   found, and I suppose it can.

 Pres. W. Woodruff, spoke of the Priesthood not remaning  on the earth longer than one centryury after the death of Jesus.  it is now again restored to the earth, was conferred upon  Joseph and Oliver Cowdery, it is the power of eternal life,  and belongs to the celestial kingdom, spoke of the perfect  unity of  father, son & Holy Ghost, in mind and affinity.  there is no division in them, neither in the celestial kingdom  young men to a division especialy in political matters.  I hope never to see the young men drawing off from their  Fathers, and sit up an independant position. I expect better  things of them. I trust they will not disappoint the Prophet and  their Fathers bilut will carry on this work. The judgement  of God await the wicked, and also this nation if they  repent not. Joseph Smith holds the keys of the Priesthood  in this generation, and will hold the same through eternity.

 Richfield Severe County July 25 [18]87    Dear Brother & Sister Cottam  While Brother Wm is  writing to Emma, I will try to scratch a few lines  to you. As Brother Wm Has given a full listing about our  team and colts to Emma I will say nothing about that  ownly it was like leaving a couple of children to leave  those two poor Little colts but we could not travel any  Longer with them and it was a Marvel that we got  them as far as we did But there is a good old Danish  Grand Mother who will give them green Lucern Every day  and I think they would do better than they would to  travel. I am as Well as usual ownly I get very  weary come night in riding all day. We [have felt]  anxious to hear from Sister Cottam to know how  she was doing. We learn that president Taylor  is still Living but very Low I expect we will be  in Salt lake County in 4 or 5 days if all is Well  We have not Been in a situation to write while on the  road before while we camped on Fish Creek for 24 [hours]  to doctor the colts & give them rest. I went to fishing I  caught 54 trout small ones so we had a plenty of fish to  Eat I would be very glad to come in & spend a  night with you and see how you are getting along  please give my Love to Amelia George & Thomas & families  And Ask Thomas if He is fulfilling the mission I gave  him I dont want him to Neglect that for He that is faithful  [illegible] some game for his Mother will be blessed with plenty to  eat so Brother Thomas remember your promise I went to be  [illegible] to Sister Emma & family I [2 illegible words] is a [bookworm] in 16 family Brother Wm & myself being gone

 but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year.  The snow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground is  thoroughly soaked 3 feet deep. I do not know how much deeper.  Spring has broke upon us mild and warm, the top of the ground  is beginning to be dry but the wells are raising.    Every kind of fruit trees from the apples to the currant, are   loaded with fruit buds and some of the Peaches and apricots are   ready to blossom. I think it will be a fruitful year for all kinds  of fruit; grain and vegetables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finished  it has been a great job. I expect the stone will come floating to the  Temple, they are now hauling with cattle: the temple foundation is   surrounded with stone cutters who make rich sweet music. I expect   after conference there will be several hundreds cutting stone, and the tem-  ple will be pushed.    We have had a great Reformation this winter, one of the fruits  are all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored their stollen  property, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: all isare trying  to pay their Tithing and nearly all are trying to get wives until there  is hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah but what is married or just  going to be. President Young has hardly time to eat, drink, or sleep  in consequence of marrying the people and attending to the endowments.   I never have had so much to do in my life. I would think it  would wear him out. There has hardly been a ball or party for recreation  [th]rough this Territory for the last 6 months. I have attended a meeting of  some kind about every evening through the past winter and have not visited  your family much, nor any body else; not among my own but little  for 5 months and generally get to bed about 11 or 12 oclock. I have

 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as  they have done, the past winter. I hope it will continue. the power  of God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorum  and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died,  and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionaries  rested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards; who was unwell consid-  erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hyde  have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelv  (except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer  Trip North to Salmon river.    This Spring A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us about  the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some  missionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President   Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-  ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and  Kanosh with other chiefs, are making great improvement. Arrow-  peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it  was good.    We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or  12.00 lbs.; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.  a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to  try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.    All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory  some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern  settlements have started on the short road, or cut off to go there,  and no doubt some others will follow them soon. Your family   are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are  ^see page 443^ 
 1878-11-09 Apostles C C Rich and W Woodruff addressed the  meeting spoke upon the rise and progress of  the great Latter day Work and the opposition  contending against it. God chooses the weak things  of the world to confound the mighty as instances  in Moses in the deciples of Jesus and in the   Prophet Joseph Smith & others. [##1 Corinthians 1:27##] Was pleased to  see the great facilities we have in these mountains  for building Temples. If we could see behind  the veil we should have no trouble to get  Temples built. The work for the redemption of  the dead is great. 
 1883-08-18 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he would report  the ward he come from. The 1st Presidency  are trying to do their best to build up Gods  Kingdom The Apostles and Seventies and  High Priests are doing the same the societies  organized to assist the Bp are doing the  best they can. We have also about 40  grog shops but the saints of God do not patronize  them. Spoke on the work of the redemption of  the dead 
 Pres W Woodruff said it gave him great pleasure  and Satisfaction to meet in the beautiful building  with the Saints of Bear Lake. This is one of hte most  beautiful houses ever built by the Saints in this  generation and it is a credit to the Pres of this Stake  of Zion and the Elders and Saints who have assisted    We have no reason to be discouraged concerning  the great work. Joseph Smith lived 14 years to lay  the foundation of this work. The Lord has as far  fulfilled his promises to us. He has never forsaken  His people in the midst of all their trials and  persecution nor will He in time to come. There is  no people on the earth that has been called to so  great a work as the L. D. S. many of the revelations  and prophicies would have failed had not the  Saints been gathered inst. One of the greatest testimonies  is in the fact of all the Sects of the world being  united in the persecution of this people. This work  is not dead, and it is not going to die. We are here upon  a mission to help build up this Kingdom and if    faithful we shall, continue our labors behind the veil.  Read the Book of Mormon. Doc and Cov, the Bible and all   good books. We have built three Temples in these Vallies  where we can officiate for our dead and where that  work is being performed day by day. When we go  behind the veil we will find our history recorded in  the Courts above 
 1889-08-11Pres W. Woodruff fell thankful for the opportunity  of again partaking of the Sacrament. Made remarks  thereon. Gave an outline of the organization of the  Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Also on  the Priesthood as being the only power by which man  can administer in the ordinances of life and salvation.  No matter what position a man holds if he honors  his Priesthood that man has power with the Heavens.  Such a man cannot be led astray. This people will   never be led astray, they will never be without a   law given until Christ comes to reign. The second coming  of the Son of man is near at hand, the prophicies will  all be fulfilled. Let us do our duty and leave our  enemies in the hands of God. The Lord will not require  the L. D. S. to go to war or stain their hands with blood nor  will he permit our blood to be shed only perhaps in  individual cases, but not as a general thing. Honor  God and keep His commandments. To the young  people he would say learn to pray, they will have to  bear off the Kingdom 
 1889-08-12Pres W. Woodruff. A man has a right to  preach what he practices. The word of Wisdom  has been and is practiced by myself and  Council. Don't go into debt. Don't buing machinery  which you can do without. Pay your debts.  There are men who have withdrawn from the  Church in order to accomplish their political rights.  I wish to say to them that they are justified before  the Lord.    [left side of page]  Pres Woodruff  justifies the  Mormons with-  drawing from the  Church to vote.  [end of text]    The congregation voted in unison.    Wherever there is a Church established that has not  Apostles, Prophets and other officers of the Church it  is not the Church of God. Where they have not the  Authority of the Eternal Priesthood there is no Church  of Christ. Abraham Isaac and Jacob were Patriarchs  they held the Holy Priesthood. Joseph Smith organized  this Church by the power of the Priesthood. How  greatly the children of the L. D. S are blessed to live  in the midst of Prophets, Apostles, Elders &c who have  the word of God. Their fathers hold the Priesthood  They should obey them and honor them. No man can  comprihend the torments and sufferings of those  who have tasted of the blessings of Eternal life  and turn there from. Spoke of the mission of Bro  Cannon to the Sandwich Islands and the introduction  of the Gospel to that people. The speaker said his life  had been preserved many times through listening to  the voice of the Spirit. Related many incidents in  support of the above. 
 1889-08-12 Pres Woodruff said his feeling were that  many of the rising generation before him will live  until Christ comes in the clouds of Heaven. He  wanted to see the young people stop doing that which  is wrong and cultivate the Spirit of Prayer and fel  and qualify themselves for active service in the  Kingdom. The judgements of God are at our doors. 
 1889-09-15 Pres W. Woodruff, said whenever a watchman is  set upon the tower of Zion and he does not give  warning when the enemy approaches he will be held to  account. Joseph asked the Lord for wisdom and the Lord  appeared to him, also His Son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith  was ordained to introduce and lay the foundation of this  great and mighty work. After he received the manifestations  which he had he would have been damned if he had  not obeyed the voice of God. He had traveled hundreds  of miles with and was well acquainted with the   Prophet. This generation has a great debt to pay in  shedding the blood of the Prophets. The Jews have had to  pay for shedding the blood of the Savior, they have been  in bondage in consequence for hundreds of years.  Crime is largely on the increase. There is a thousand  murders today where there was one when the Book of   Mormon was translated and other crimes have  increased in like proportion. Testified that God  moved upon Columbus to search out and open up  the way to this land. Washington was inspired to do  his work and the Declaration of Independence is an  inspired document. He was sorry for this great  Nation because it will cost them just as much  as any other nation who sheds the blood of the  Prophets. What will be the result of these persecutions?  The judgements of God are ^and well be^ poured out upon the  Nations. He heard Joseph Smiths last speech before  his martyrdom who sealed upon the Twelve all  the Keys and powers which he then held.  Exhorted the Saints to be true and faithful to  their covenants. 
 1889-09-15Pres Woodruff said he was very thankful that his  life had been spared to attend the Dedication of another  house for the worship of God.    Father Adam before his death called together his  sons and their posterity and gave them a Patriarchal  blessing reaching down to the end of time.    When we behold the many Temples and Tabernacles  which have been erected for the worship of God in  the Latterdays it must be pleasing to Adam.  These things are pleasing to all the Prophets who have  prophecied concerning the day in which we live.  He was satisfied the Lord was pleased with it.  Inasmuch as we keep the commandments of God  His presense will be with us and His power attend   us. This is the greatest of all dispensations the Lord  has given to man. We of all people have the  greatest cause to rejoice to think that we live in this  day. We will inherit the glory, the Law of which we  keep. Good and evil is set before us as with those of  our progenitors, and our free agency is given us that  we may choose whom we will serve. We are all  tempted and will be to the end of time. It will  pay us to keep the commandments of God. Trusted  that we will be of one heart and mind while we   are together. 
 1891-08-09 Pres W. Woodruff, fell thankful for the privilege of  meeting with the L. D. S. in this Stake. Seek first the  Kingdom of God &c. The Prophets and Apostles in   every age have been called to preach the Kingdom  of God. They did not pay attention to what they should  eat or drink or wear. It is so in this day. The Saints in  those days had the Holy Ghost so much so that they  could see the eternal reward for them which was  ahead. They sealed their testimony with their blood.  Our mission is to prepare the world for the second  coming of our Saviour. We must not deviate  from the way laid down by God through His  servants. Referred to the establishment of the Gospel  in the Sandwich Islands and Bro Cannons administration  his faithfulness and integrity and the success which  has crowned his labors. Our reward is not in this  life. He would like to live to see the Temple in  Salt Lake City dedicated. Prayed God to bless the congregation  and His work in all the world in the name of Jesus.

 TO THE SAINTS.    MESSRS. TAYLOR & WOODRUFF:    It has been so long since I addressed the   saints through the medium of the Times and  Seasons, that I feel confident that a few words   from my pen, by way of advice, will be well  received, as well as a 'way mark' to guide the   'faithful' in future. I was sorry to learn, by   your remarks upon the resolutions of the  'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap-  peared not long since, that any of the saints   abroad were more apt to patronize the com-  mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For   the important reason, that the church of Jesus   Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of   eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto   done, must continue to publish such portions   of them for the benefit of the saints, and the  salvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from   time to time, direct.    Freedom is a sweet blessing; men have a   right to take and read what papers they please:  But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of   thistles? It certainly is no more than just to   suppose that 'charity begins at home,' and if so,   what must such as profess to be saints think,   when they patronize the splendor of Babylon,   and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want   of bread?    Beside which, if virtue is justified rather   than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula-  ted to happify man, and dignify society, will,   yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com-  mandment, given anciently was, to love one   another; even so, the works of the saints, at   home and abroad, will bear its own testimony;   whether they love the brethren.    In all the world, the Times and Seasons]- is   the only paper that virtually sustains, accord-  ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy,   'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations  —and what shall be said of him that is like   the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the   way. When we behold men who 'have borne   the heat and the burden of the day;' strug-  gled against the popular opinions of a vain   world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the   vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false-  hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil-  ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help-  ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con-  tains the simple answer.    Now let me say once for all, like the psalm-  ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is   for brethren to dwell together in unity.'    As the precious ointment upon the head,  that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went   down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew   of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains 
 of Zion, is such unity—for there the Lord com-  manded the blessing—life forever more! Unity   is power, and when the brethren as one man,  sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain   me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith,   works, history, and progress of the church.—  The brethren who conduct the paper have   been appointed to that important station be-  cause they are worthy and well qualified, and   what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God   and man is it, to see the charity of a brother   support his brethren as an evidence that he   means to pass from death into life?    Many of the articles which appear in the   Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations,  translations, or are the united voice of confer-  ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of   silver,' are treasures more than meet for the   called, chosen, and faithful among the saints;   and should be more than drink to those that   hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau-  voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I   expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in   circulation by the vigilance of the elders and   saints—so as to be a herald of truth, and a   standard of pure and undefiled religion. Fin-  ally, men and brethren, when you support my   friends, you support me.    In the bonds of the   new and everlasting   covenant, I am your   humble servant,   JOSEPH SMITH. 
 North Columbia Cal.  Dec 5 [18]92    Dear Uncle, Wilford Woodruff.    Undoubt-  edly you will be surprised  to receive a letter from me  after my long silence. I am  not real sure that I ans-  wered your letter written after  my father's death. Closely  upon my papa's death my strength  gave way from the severe strain  and for a long time I was  miserable to think of  writing to any one. I dropped  my social correspondense, and  have never reopened all   of it.    Recently I heard through  a friend of mine that another   friend of mine in Nevada City Cal. 
 (a Mr. Searles, lawyer) had a   picture of you in a book  of his, and that the picture  looked very much like  my father, so I thought  maybe you would send me  a picture of yourself—a  photograph if you had one  to spare, if I wrote to you  for it.    The Mr. Searles of whom  I spoke above, is a son of  Hon. Niles Searles, who was a   delegate to Washington D. C. last  spring, to in behalf of the  mining interests of California.    In your last letter to  me and in fact, I think the   only one I have ever received  from you, you mentioned the  fact of often passing through  Colfax. Some time, don't you 
 think you could arrange  to run over to Nevada City  and out to Columbia Hill  for a visit? We would be so  glad to see you, I know  you must have a great   deal to occupy your time,  and it is asking a good  deal, to ask for a visit,  but I hope some-day you  can come, if not for longer    This is our first   pleasant day since Thanks-  giving, and we enjoy the  sun very much. Our winters  are not severely cold as a rule.  This winter we have had a  great deal of rain. During  the month of November, 13.87 in  this for '92, during Nov. of 1891  1. and a few hundredths.  That is quite a difference.

 Saint Louis October 22nd [18]56    Bro Woodruff    I wrote to you last   from Westport Connecticut. I received nothing  from Utah, by the September Mail.    Elder Taylor  finished his narration, of the maytrdom of   Joseph & Hyrum Smith. I do myself the  credit of thinking he never would have  accomplished it, had I not remained with  him and kept his mind on the subject, as there  are many topics of exciting interest, which  drew his attention. To edit the Mirmon alone  is abundant work for one man, and there are  many cares which necessarily surrond bro Taylor  in other directions than editing the paper.    I have preached  several times in Westport, Norwalk & neighbouring  places. I took a violent cold, when the  fall rain's commenced, it settled on my lungs  and lasted three weeks. the weather has been  quite severe but is now mild and pleasant.    On the morning of the 6th October  as I was coming from Chicago to this place  in an express train, fifteen minutes before 3 O Clock  it being very dark & foggy, we came in collision 
 with an express train from Alton, a general  ruin was the immediate consequence, tho'  miraculously no lives were lost, the brakeman  had both jaws broken, and his legs twice a piece,  and one knee smashed up. A dutch doctor who  was a fellow passenger, trimmed off the smashed  knee, set his other leg in two places ^&^ set his  jaws. we left him to recover if he could; after  a delay of 10 or 12 hours on the prariae, another  Train came along, and conveyed us on way rejoicing  that the accident was no worse.    The is about 700  Saints residing in St. Louis. they are principally  European brethren working here to get a [fit out]  they have rented the Methodist Church on  4th Streat and have preaching three times  every Sabbath. A considerable number of strangers  attend on the Sabbath evenings, and appear to  give good attention.    Elder Snows health has  been poor since I have been here. he negotiated  drafts drawn by Elder Spencer on the Liverpool  Office to the amount of some 4 or 5 thousand pounds  for the benefit of the Emigration fund. these  drafts have been protested by Bro Pratt for  nonpayment, and the long list of forfeitures,  damages, [duns], and the devil know's what, which  are the result of such a transaction, have a tenden[cy] 
 to keep down his Spirits, producing in my mind  a visible effect upon his health, which is  at best rather poor. theserough these circum-  stances, he has not yet been enabled to republish  the Luminary. Bro Snow has been ^is^ borrowing  small sums of money wherever he can, in order  to pacify these claimants. He has sent  Elder Coward to England, to try and effect  some arrangements, to meet these drafts, the  error appears to have been committed, through  a misunderstanding of Bro Spencer, as to the  amount of funds, the Liverpool Office had to  dispose of, had thy matter been understood  as it really was, the drafts might have been  disposed of at 90 days sight, ^or longer^ and have arvided  the forfeitures per cent, damages, loss of credit, and  caused annoyances, growing out of a return of  protested paper.    The recent State Elections  in Pensylvania & Indiana, show favorable  for the election of Buchannan, should Fillmore  carry a few Southern States, it may go to the  House. The know nothing and Democrat papers  pronounce Freemont's cake to be dough, as  he could not be possibly be elected, without  Indiana or Pensylvania, as no Slave State   will go for him. Sixteen Democratic members  of Congress have been returned from Pensylvania 
 which show, that the Douglas doctrine  the non intervention, in the domestic affairs  of Territories, is rather on the gain, in  the Keystone State, there being only 6  at the last election.    Please call and see  my wife and children and give them  a good word of advice. I may be able  to do you as good a turn some day.    Give my respects  to the Clerks in the Office and all  enquiring friends. I remain Your  Bro in the Gospel &c.    Geo. A.

 Portland Jany. 16th. 1856    Dear Brother & Sister    Really after so long a  time I recd a letter from brother Wilford to day  via California. a long wait and a long time coming.  I was very glad to hear from you and that you  are all so well. If for the best, hope your crops  may be better another year. should they find you  are a long ways from a market. How pleasant  it must be for you to have such fine fruit as you   raise there, and you must know how to appreciate  having been deprived of it so long. I should like  very much to have a few of your fine peaches  and grapes when ripe. The crops with us the   past season were very abundant, probably  never more than two thirds as much ever raised  in one year as there was the last year and still  previous one high owing in part to the trouble in  Europe, which continues, but we hope there is  some prospect of peace. If the money that has   been expended to distroy people there, had been  used for the purchase of Bibles to distribute with  the destituate, there would be less human misery then  there is now, no doubt. The end is not yet  England and France may get into a quarrel,  and if so the result will be disastrous. the  pride of those nations are is so great, that neither  of them would be willing to yield -- 
 I have no news of importance to communicate.  matters and things move along about as usual.  Our friends at Scarbor[ough] are as well as usual.  Father continues smart. Aunt Mary Fabyan is  as well as usual. Jonathan Foss was buried  last Saturday, has lived alone since his wife  died. Abial Carters wife at Concord is dead.  Presume you have heard that Fabyons wife is dead.  She died some three months since, was sick  about two weeks. our friends at Illinois are   all as well as usual. Meuther has just returned  from New York, where she has been for the past  four months in the care of one old family doctor  I don't know as she is any better. her health is  very poor and a little thing might carry her off.  our children are as well as usual and grew  finally, are getting quite large. how much we  want to see your family. presume they have grown  out of one knowledge, Ezra and family are well.    We are having a great quantity of snow this  winter. it was late, but we now have enough.  Our winters in Maine are very severe. I wish  I could be somewhere else with my family,  but it seems that I am to remain here for the  present. I hope to hear from you often, and will write  you. I fear you have not got many of my letters the past season  as there has been so much trouble with the Indians. Please  remember us kindly to all our friends, Meuther sends much love  May God bless you and yours and permit us all to meet  when there is no more parting is the prayer of   very truly yours I. F.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dec. 18, 1895.    Prest. James E Steele,    Bingham Stake.    Dear Brother:    At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of   Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions   were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of   Stakes, Bishops, and their associate officers, and all whom they may   concern:    There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes   of Zion, of High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have   been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization   distinct from that of the Teachers' Quorum and being presided over by a   president and two counselors.  The tendency of such organizations has   been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or   quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted, was, Is it proper for   such organizations to exist, or to be presided over in this manner? The   Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them   in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church government;    neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that   the brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers,   should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they   should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the   Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well-  being of the ward. 
 The second question was: At which of the meetings of the saints   should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession –-  at the general meeting of the members of the ward, at the fast meeting,   or the monthly priesthood meeting? It was the mind of the Council that   the regulations of confessions in such cases should be left to the   Bishopric of the ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each   case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the pub-  licity which has been given to it. For instance, whr^e^re people guilty   of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their transgression   is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public.   But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made   before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood   meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a stll more   public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession   shall be made at the monthly fast meeting (which meetings are attended   almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall   confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.    The object of this restriction is to confine the confession   as much as possible to the circrle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and   to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation,   which says (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in   a meeting, and that not before the world."    As a rule, therefore, where the transgression is known to but   a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at   the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has   become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more   public confession be required.    We are, Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff,  Geo. Q. Canon  Jos. F. Smith
