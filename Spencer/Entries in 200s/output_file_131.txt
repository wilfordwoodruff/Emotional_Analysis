FIGURE I met with The Presidency and Twelve at President Office at about 12 oclok. The subjet of the Endowments and 2nd Anointings was presented when President Young said that the order of the 2nd anointing was for the persons to be anointed to be cloathed in their Priestly robes the man upon the right hand and wife or wifes upon the left hand. The Administrator may be dressed in his usual clothing or in his Priestly Robes as he may see fit. The meeting should be opened by Prayer then the Administrator should Anoint the man A King and Priest unto the Most High God. Then he should Anoint his wife or wives Queens and Priestess unto her husband. There should be but one man anointed at any one meeting. If more than one man is anointed in a day, They should come together and open by Prayer as though their had not been any meeting before and thus continue to the End.   Presidet Young said when a woman was Anointed a Queen to a good man and he died and the woman was sealed to another man for time it was not necessary for her to be anointed a Queen again but if she was Anointed a Queen to a man who was not worthy of a wife and she is sealed to another man she should be anointed a Queen unto him. When a good man dies and his wives have not been anointed Queens unto him they may be anointed Queens to him after his death without any Proxey. In speaking of the Endowments President Young said that all persons who wished strickly to observedthe law of the Celestial Marriage should not get married untill they get their Endowments and are sealed at the Altar There may be instances whare persons are Aged and infirm   ENDENTRY Dec 26 1866   and not Able to get to the Endowment House if they have  not had their Endowments may be sealed and in some insta- nces I have given this permission and others have taken the advantage of it and urged to be sealed without coming to the Endowment House. I gave A Lyman the privilege of sealing some in Sanbernadeno by his urgent request but it will ^not^ avail any thing. Some may ask the question why may we not seal and give Endowments abroad, because it  would destroy the object of the gathering. The People should be gathered at head Quarters whare they can be taught in the things of the kingdom of God and be under the direction of the Priesthood. President Young said that when Persons come to get their Endowments should be clean and pure A man should not touch a woman for 10 days before getting their Endowments and the Twelve while travelling should hold meetings with the male members as priesthood meetings and teach these but they have to handled in wisdom or Evil will grow out of it   In speaking of the death of Joseph Smith the prophet President Young said it was necessary for Joseph  Smith to shed his blood seal his Testimony with his blood that his testimony might rest upon all Nations that the wicked might be left without ecxcuse in the day of Gods Judgments upon the wicked, if this  had not been the case he would not have been slain in the Twelve and a web was woven which brought about this Event The subject of A sermon Preached by A Lyman and published in the Millennium Star April 5, 1862, in vol 24 was brought up and red and it was found to have done away with the Efficasy of the blood of Christ President  B Young said he wished to know what the Twelve had to  say about it For he had a good deal to say about it when you do away with the blood of the savior you do away with all the Gospel and plan of Salvation. If this doctrine as Preached by A Lyman and some by   ENDENTRY Dec 26, 1866   O Pratt be preached and Published as the doctrine of the Church and not contradicted by us it would not be long before there would be syms schysms in the Church this doctrin as Preached in this sermon is fals doctrin if we do not believe that it wouldas necesary for Christ to shed his Blood to save the world, whare is our church it is nothing. This does not set well upon my feelings. It is grievious to me to have the Apostles teach fals doctrines. Now if the Twelve will sit down quietly and not contradict such doctrines are they justified no they are not   In speaking of our Temporal Position President Young  said if we could get up Female relief societies and they  would use their influence to get the sisters to make their  own bonnetts and make and wear their own Homemade  clothing it would do much good   President Young said as A Philosipher I wish to ask a question is there any Reflection or thought upon any thing that does not Exist I think there is   At the close of the meeting we made an Appointment to meet at the Endowment House at 12 oclok   I met in the Evening with the Jordan dam company in the council chamber, then went to President Youngs office and red the minutes of the day    ENDENTRY December 27, 1866 ~ Thursday   27.

It seems as though there never was a more wicked and corrupt Generation than the one which we live. The whole Earth is ripened in iniquity and prepared for the damnation of Hell. Many of both people and rulers of this Nation are seaking to destroy the Church and Kingdom of God from off the Earth, and we are ownly preserved through the power and Mercy of God. All Nations are preparing for war, and are fearing and trembling for fear of those  things which are coming upon the Earth. There is an awful uncertainty resting upon all Nations, but do not  know what awaits them. The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter day Saints, the Zion of God, and the Kingdom of God are all progressing in the mountains of Israel, the wicked say let our Eye be upon Zion and let her be defi- led, but they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither understand they his ways. But the Saints of God understand they that are faithful are looking for the judgments of God to come upon the wicked, and for the coming of the Son of Man. There has been more sin, wickedness,  and abominations, committed in the United States, and throughout the Christian world during 1866 than in fifty years a centeury ago. the whole Earth groans under the sin and abominations which reigns upon the face thereof. The Lord is withdrawing his spirit from the wicked, and the devil rulses over them, and darkness covors the Earth, and gross darkness the people. Wars and rumoorrs of wars are among all people, and great judgments await the wicked; while the righteous saints will stand in  Holy Places, and rejoice in the Lord their God, and the Kingdom of our God will increase, and fill the whole Earth and stand forever, and He will Reign whose right it is to Reign   ENDENTRY A Synopsis of my labors in 1866   I Travelled 276 Miles   I Attended Public Meetings 144 Meetings   I Preached 33 Discourses   I Attended the Prayer Circle with Pres 40 and 12 apostles   I Attended the Prayer Circle of W.

The Events of the last days will be awful for the wicked, and Blessed for the righte- ous. The Lord hath commenced a controversy with the Nations and he will never cease untill that consu- mption decreed will be fulfilled upon all the wicked what 1867 will bring to pass time must determine, it will hasten the downfall of our Nation, and Bring distress upon other Nations. Mr Ohio has presented a Bill to Congress got up by Judges Drake and Hooper our Delegate to Congress thinks it will pass Congress but thinks the President will vetoe it. Speaker Colfax is connected with them for the destruction of the Church and kingdom of God from off the Earth.  I will watch those men and see what will be their  End. The Lord will fight the Battles of his saints and he will destroy their Enemies, we may watch the signs of the times. The Lord will preserve his Saints and destroy the wicked. The wicked have sought our destruction from the time Athe Angel of  God delivered into the Hands of Joseph Smith the Prophet the Plates containing the record of the book of Mormon. But the Lord Our God has so far preserved us and will continue unto the End. Our trust is in  Him. I will watch and see what 1867 will bring forth Let all the Saints be faithful and keep the commands of God that his blessings may rest upon us. The Lord hath never deserted his people but hath sustained  them who trust in him.
