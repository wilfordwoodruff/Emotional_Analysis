 Salina, Sevier CoDecb. 15, 1890President, Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother, I write youin regard to the call of Brother ChristianMadsen, to perform a Mission; Our Brother,Dr C. Madsen's Services in this community are-we consider- very valuable, we have found himin cases of Diptheria without an equal, but,he has shown- to our satisfaction, that he labour's as much for the Interest of the com-munity, as for himself, his charges are so moderate,But, in regard to his present circumstances,they are not such, as would Justify him inleaving his family, as he is considerably in-volved, through the purchase of a Residence here- the property of one of our brethren, who had to leavehere - in consequence of being a Polygamist, BroMadsen had to borrow the money to make thepurchase, and that, by our Counsel and advice, aswe were anxious to have him here, because of his Services as a Doctor, - he is our 'County Quarentinephyscian.' We thought it proper to write youin regard to these matters - that you might understand his circumstances; Nevertheless, wedo not Question the wisdom of the call,If in the view of the Presidency, Bro Madsen'sservices in the Vineyard are required.Praying the blessing of the Lord uponyou, and his spirit to guide you, I remainyour brother in the Gospel.James S. Jensen, Bp. 
 Salina, Sevier Co, Dec. 17, 1890Presdt Wilford WoodruffDear Bro. In answer to your inquiry madethrough Bro Geo Reynolds, concerning the "Missionary Call" ofBro Joseph Sorensen of this place, will say, that he wasCalled this spring, to perform a mission to New Zealand,but, was at that ^time^ unable to arrange his buisness, so as to leaveat the time appointed, and on explaining this by letter tothe "First Presidency", was given till fall, to arrange matters,and prepare for the mission; this he did; but did not consider it his duty to acquaint you of the fact that hewas ready, I advised him to write and inform you, but,"he was not going to beg for a mission"; hence, I wrotegiving the information that, "Bro Sorenson, was ready for the mission," and recd a reply from Bro Reynolds, Nov 18, that"no missionaries, were at present needed in New Zealand,and that his field of labour had been changed to the SouthernStates," and that the company of missionary Elders would leaveDecr 17th. I was requested to inform Bro Sorensen of these facts.I have done so, Bro Sorensen in consequence of my writing to inform you of his being prepared, insists that I havecalled him, through Spite. Bro Sorensen is of a Familywhose only hope of salvation, to all appearance, seems to bethrough him, as he is the only one who seems to take interestin the 'Work of God', but, he is not strong in the faith, andwe thought, in his case, as in others, a 'mission' would be agreat blessing to him, and, also, to the Sorensen Family, hencewe sent in his name. We have three ^4^ returned missionaries, young men who were called as he was, who beleived the  work, but had no positive testimony, who, since their return, bear strong and faithful Testimonies, and aredoing much good in the Ward. Infidelity had spreadamongst the young people of the Ward, but, since the return
