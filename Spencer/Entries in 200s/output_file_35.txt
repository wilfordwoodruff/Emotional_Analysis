 Salina, Sevier Co  Decb. 15, 1890    President, Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, I write you  in regard to the call of Brother Christian  Madsen, to perform a Mission; Our Brother,  Dr C. Madsen's Services in this community are  -we consider- very valuable, we have found him  in cases of Diptheria without an equal, but,  he has shown- to our satisfaction, that he   labour's as much for the Interest of the com-  munity, as for himself, his charges are so moderate,    But, in regard to his present circumstances,  they are not such, as would Justify him in  leaving his family, as he is considerably in-  volved, through the purchase of a Residence here  - the property of one of our brethren, who had to leave  here - in consequence of being a Polygamist, Bro  Madsen had to borrow the money to make the  purchase, and that, by our Counsel and advice, as  we were anxious to have him here, because of his   Services as a Doctor, - he is our 'County Quarentine  physcian.' We thought it proper to write you  in regard to these matters - that you might   understand his circumstances; Nevertheless, we  do not Question the wisdom of the call,  If in the view of the Presidency, Bro Madsen's  services in the Vineyard are required.    Praying the blessing of the Lord upon  you, and his spirit to guide you, I remain  your brother in the Gospel.    James S. Jensen, Bp. 
 Salina, Sevier Co, Dec. 17, 1890    Presdt Wilford Woodruff    Dear Bro. In answer to your inquiry made  through Bro Geo Reynolds, concerning the "Missionary Call" of  Bro Joseph Sorensen of this place, will say, that he was  Called this spring, to perform a mission to New Zealand,  but, was at that ^time^ unable to arrange his buisness, so as to leave  at the time appointed, and on explaining this by letter to  the "First Presidency", was given till fall, to arrange matters,  and prepare for the mission; this he did; but did not   consider it his duty to acquaint you of the fact that he  was ready, I advised him to write and inform you, but,  "he was not going to beg for a mission"; hence, I wrote  giving the information that, "Bro Sorenson, was ready for the   mission," and recd a reply from Bro Reynolds, Nov 18, that  "no missionaries, were at present needed in New Zealand,  and that his field of labour had been changed to the Southern  States," and that the company of missionary Elders would leave  Decr 17th. I was requested to inform Bro Sorensen of these facts.    I have done so, Bro Sorensen in consequence of my writing   to inform you of his being prepared, insists that I have  called him, through Spite. Bro Sorensen is of a Family  whose only hope of salvation, to all appearance, seems to be  through him, as he is the only one who seems to take interest  in the 'Work of God', but, he is not strong in the faith, and  we thought, in his case, as in others, a 'mission' would be a  great blessing to him, and, also, to the Sorensen Family, hence  we sent in his name. We have three ^4^ returned missionaries,   young men who were called as he was, who beleived the    work, but had no positive testimony, who, since their   return, bear strong and faithful Testimonies, and are  doing much good in the Ward. Infidelity had spread  amongst the young people of the Ward, but, since the return

Bro Sorensen has an abundance of means, and is well  able to perform a Mission, and leave his Family well  cared for, In regard to his 'Rheumatism', it does not  interfere with 'Wood haulings' and all other kinds of  manual labour.

In reply to the same I will say  that I feel highly honered to be considered  worthy of so great a calling as to preach the  Gosple of Salvation. As to my circumstances if I should  take a naturel view of them, it would seam almost  impossible for me to go at the time you mention. not  because I am so very poor financialy, but I am  so mixed up in my business affairs, and considerable  in debt, which will naturily take some time to settle  up. Yet I do not feel to Justify myself in any way  by making any excuse. I will be ready whenever  the call is made on me, having full confidence that  the way will be open for me. You will confer a  favor by informing me, at your convenience, as  near as possible, the time I will have to leave.

Brown, of Greenwich, and  he is also the choice of the Indians.    In reguards to the Mission to the  Sandwich Islands, to work there as  Blacksmith, I can say that my first  family would be rather a burden on  the people here, as my oldest son is  only eight years of age, and three children  under five years, including a nursing  babe, And very little means of support.

I wish to say that I am both willing and   desirous of doing all I can to further the  cause of God, in any place where I can be made  the most useful, but my circumstances are such  that unless a way is opened to enable me to sell  some property to raise the means, it is doughtful  whether I could get ready before fall; that is,  if missionaries go to that field in the fall, still  I will labour to gather means to go—if   possible—at the time Appointed in your letter,  and hope by the blessing of the Lord, I may be  successful,    Your brother in the Gospel  Joseph Sorensen.

His intention was to have  been there at the time appointed; but as his  finances are rather low, he expresses a desire to  start direct from here. With your sanction  and the delegating of some one to set him apart,  the change would, we think, be quite a saving in  cash to Bro. Brundage.

I think it   would be wisdom to let him remain at home another   year so as to enable him to finish his house and get out   of debt. I would suggest the name of James Nielson   in his stead, or Theodore Gyllingskog, both good young   men and would make good missionaries.    Very Respectfully your Brother,    Geo L. Farrell 
 Smithfield Jan 7, 1891.    Dear Brother:    Yours to hand asking the Nationality of   T. Gyllingskog & J. Nielson, "they are both Swedes," and can  both go if they think so, Nielson has just got married, but that  will make no difference if he feel's like Jas H. Merrill, who is going,  and just married, and feels splendid.    Please let me know how many are going to New Zeland   with Bro Wm Douglass, he is anxious to know if he will have  company.    We have another young man that can go to England, named  William Hillyard he is English, a good young man. also  an American who could go to New Zeland if needed. named  Westly Gibson, age about 21. it would be good for them to take  a mission, and I believe they would make good missionaries.
