We fully recognize the fact that from the earliest days in Utah, the leaders have built factories themselves and have constantly  taught the necessity of sustaining home manufacturers.  Investigation shows that the present condition of affairs makes vigorous action necessary to overcome the apathy and indifference of the majority of the people on this subject.  We are working on lines somewhat different from the efforts of the  past, but the object in view is the same.  In order to make our work effective and thorough, we are anxious to have the advice and assist- ance of others of influence and experience, and we hope you can give  us a few minutes of your time at an early date.
