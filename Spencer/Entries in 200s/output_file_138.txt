 [sideways text] E. H. Anderson,13 March 1891. [end of sideways text]Agust 29Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.Kjebenhavn March 13 1891President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:We need thirty missionaries for the ScandinavianMission as early as possible in the Fall of 1891. As tonationality and dialect, they should be divided as follows:Danish, 8: for Stockholm and Goteborg, Sweden, 12; forSkane, Sweden, 4; for Christiania, Norway, 6.Our progress during the past four months,has averaged that of the past two winters. A numberof the older brethren, however, have been unable to work,owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some.As far as I know; all are now well.The present edition of the Danish Hymn Book isnearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published,the work should be carefully revised, which should bedone so that we could send it to press next winter.I think this labor is of great importance, as it is afact that our hymns have a great influence in spread-ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con-verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest,therefore, that a committee of interested and capableScandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, tosave expence, should be done at home in Utah, and thework sent over here for publication.  To make it whatit should be, there are a number of improvements needed 
 in the book which will be fully apparent to those whoundertake the task. The meter should be changed in a number of the songs so as to make these suitable forour psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodysnow used, which are often very inappropriate ina house of worship; and more of the principles anddoctrines should be treated upon with less of Zionand the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, buteven strangers are often too eager to embrace. Aconsiderable proportion of those who emigrate eachyear are Gentiles, and our people are continuallysending for their friends who care nothing in a num-ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove ofgreat injury to the cause by returning unfavorablewritings to these lands, after they are gathered.Elders J. M. Sjodahl, P. O. Thomasen, and C. C. A. Chris-tensen would be among the best that could be foundto do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the assistance of such other talent as might be selected.Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is nowworking in this office, but who expects to return home next Fall, would be of much assistance in the workowing to his musical ability, and his familiarity withthe wants of choirs and singers in this mission.Hoping that these matters will received yourfavorable consideration, and praying God to bless youabundantly, I remain,Your brother in the Gospel of Christ,Edw. H. Anderson.

Kjebenhavn Nov. 8 1890President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:I have just made a round tour of this mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returningon the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest. Young an account in detail of our conferences, andof matters as I found them. The work is progress-ing quite favorably in this mission, and especiallydo we find many in Northern Sweden who investi-gate the principles of the Gospel. During the pastsix months there have been 312 baptisms in the mission.We will need 20 missionaries next spring, which should be divided as follows: Danes 5; from Stockholm or Goteborg, North-ern Sweden 7; from S Kane, southern Sweden 4; from Norway 4,. We can not use South-ern Swedes for the north part of that country;and as the northern portion is the bestfield we hope to have the full quota forthat part as early as they can be sent over;in fact, it would be well if they were nowin the field.I take the liberty of suggesting that we 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor.Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.Kjebenhavn 189need a Danish writer and a Swedish writer, torelieve the brethren who are now laboring in that calling. It is well to have them on hand, so as tofamiliarize themselves with their work, some lengthof time before the present laborers leave. I suggestas the Danish translator Elder O. J. Anderson, ofCastle Dale, Emery Co. and as the Swedish translator, Elder Charles Kallstrom of Logan. These brethrenshould be here early in the summer. We needalso some specially qualified men to relieve the Conference presidents who will return next sum-mer and fall. I suggest the following namesfrom which a selection could be made:Danes: Jos.

Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, UtahDear Brother:  I herewith enclose a list ofnames of persons recommended as being quali-fied and capable of filling missions in Scan-dinavia, and if you deem it proper we wouldbe pleased to have them called and sent to thesecountries to assist in the work of the Lord.I sent a similar list to Prest. Young at Liver-pool on the 9th Jan., but for some cause it can notnow be found there, and, having been mislaid, ithas not been forwarded to you.  It is thereforeby the suggestion of Prest. Young, or the brotherat Liverpool having charge of the mission,that I send this list direct to you.  It is nowvery late, but these Elders were intended to havebeen among the Spring supply of missionaries.You have no doubt by this time been informedof the number of needed for Scandinavia -- 30,(12 Swedes, 8 [Norwegians ] and 10 Danes.)By request of Prest. Young, I also send youa list of notes due this office from parties mostby residing in Utah.  These amounts have beenloaned to the respective parties on their promiseof paying same as specified in the notes; some

Sal.Kjebenhavn, _______ 189__.of these accounts are now nearly ten yearsold, and, to judge from the past, they willnever be paid if left in this office.  I wouldsuggest, that these notes be sent to the churchoffice in Salt Lake City for collection, andthis office, if possible, get credit for the a-mounts, as the Scandinavian Mission canill afford to do without the means.  No doubtif the notes are presented for collection athome, the greater portion at least will bepaid, but if left here, it is very doubtful.This money was borrowed from amountson hand here for emigrations purposes, and,besides this amount, we have a borrowedbalance from the same source of Kr. 6827.25or L379.5 "  9 3/4 (about $1845.00)By this you can judge of our financialcondition, and any disposition you canmake in favor of the mission is greatly need-ed and will be thankfully received.Awaiting your favor,I remain,Your brother in the Gospel,Joseph ChristiansenPrest.

 Wilford Woodruff made remarks of a similar character. This work cannot stand still, it must go forward or go backward. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the necessity of pruning the tree off the dead branches from the tree, and those who would not pay their tithing, did not deserve the fellowshipof the saints, and ought to be cut off 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the best time for Farmers to pay their tithing was at the time they raise their produce, before they put it away in their bins and cellars - 
 Elder Woodruff mentioned an instance in his experience while with Elder Patten, who on one occasion, whenthe people had rejected their testimony washed their feet, as a testimony against them; he did know that God backed up and sustained the testimony of the lessor priesthood, but the power spoken of in the section just readhe thought was of a more special character, than that commonly held by ^all^ Elders who go forth to preach the gospel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff bore testimony to the truth of Pres.t. Wells re-marks and named an instance of bearing testimony to a number of individuals, especially one who had once held the priesthood &c and apostatized, he was constrained by the spirit to go and warn him three times, the man was coming towards him, and fell dead at his feet. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said it was very plain, that the judgments of God commenced upon the inhabitants of this wicked world after the introduction of the Gospel especially this and other civilized or ^Christian^ nations this is according to all the revelations we have on the subject. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said, all the outside world were united in fighting against Zion and the great work of the Almighty God had to be carried out by the handful of people in these vallies and if we have not faith enough as yet, to enter into the Order of Enock, we surely have sufficient to enter upon an effort of co operation, like the one suggested.We are too anxious to get rich as a people, and get Railroad stock, or Bank stock &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said he did not believe either ^in^ one or the other of those doctrines. but he did believe that many who went in the spirit world, who will receive the Gospeland enter into the Celestial Kingdom and moreover that those who have had one wife sealed to them over the Alter, and should die before they had a chance to obtain a second, would certainly be entitled to a Celestial Glory. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that while he acted under the Aaronic priesthood, as a priest, God manifested his power quite as much as since he held the Apostleship, he gave him dreams and visions &c, no matter what priesthood a man may hold, if he magnified it, God would own and bless him under it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff ^said^ that he did not think it wisdom to have our minds exercised about any matter that revelation was silent upon,and as to whether or not, the high priesthood was enjoyed between the time of Moses and the Saviour, did not really concern us, as we had many pressing duties that should engage our attention in preference. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt very thankful for the changes that are now being made, especially in the Temporal affairs of the Kingdom of God, a vast amount of responsibilites had been upon the shoulders of Prest Young for a long time as the leading Spirit of all the great enterprizes in our midst, such as the Railroad, Zions Coope Merchantile Instn, The Bank &c.He felt that the Kingdom of God was moving onward at a very rapid ^rate^, hence the necessity of new offices, and more good men being called into active service, not only in Temporal but spiritual things. Was much pleased with the Patriarchal Ordination being extended to others, to meet the growing wants of the people. 
 Elder W Woodruff spoke of the drivings and fightings of the Indians by the Government, the hand of the Lord was over that people, there is a great work for them to do in building up Zion & the new Jerusalem, they will certainly be inspired, and ^receive^ revelations from God, and we who have come into the Gospel a little before them, and we should exerciise faith for them, and pray for them. A few days us after they came into the Vallies, they saw a few Indians who came to their camp, and they gave them some bread 
 since that time, we have grown and the Lord has blest us, and the Indians are better fed and clothed than they were. we have many duties to perform towards the Indians.God alone is our friend and the Lamanites around us, had they li not been a portion of the House Indians of Israel they would have been cut off root and branch long agothey are of the seed of Joseph, and God requires us to look after their salvation. He Prophesied in the name of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that this Government ^or nation^ was nearly ripe for the Damnation of Hell. He spoke of the first Elders of the Church who had been taken away, for a wise purpose, it was necessary for an organization in this dispensation behind the vail, he believes that Joseph had lived his time out until done his work. Let us do right, build up Zion, and establish the Kingdom. Keep the commandments of God, and no earthly power can drive us from these vallies. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt satisfied that very many of our people do not pay their tithing, he kept an account of his money receipts and the products of the earth, and paid a tenth of each the law of tithing was of God, and none can neglect it without suffering loss, it has never been annulled, and has been in existance ever since the days of Adam, we shall prosper by Keeping the commandments of God, and visa, versa. 
 Elder W Woodruff said there was a great contrast between the laws, refered to and the Celestial law as given through the Gospel, if the eyes of the people of this City were opened, they would be more alive to their duties, and would hunger and thirst after righteos-ness. We are living under great priveleges, and have had many keys and principles pertaining to the living and the dead - he denounced the fashions of the Babylon which are so eagerly sought after by our Wives and Daughters - We have a great amount of preaching and are more or less responsible for this privelege.  Many of the Elders are giving way to Smoking & Drinking &c which he was sorry to see. 
 nan 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the opposing element to the priesthood from the days of Joseph until now, the many excellent traits of character in Prest Young, as coined by his works, the necessity of wise legislation, by good men, to be of good courage, do right, be faithful and united, then Congress and her many bills cannot hurt us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff also adverted to the unreliability of memory especially after a great lapse of time since the sayings had been made he himself has written a great many sayings and sermons of Joseph Smith, but when once written they invariably left his memory.The Lord lead and instructed the Prophet Joseph like a child and many things he was taught, he had but a very imperfectunderstanding at first, his on the resurection changedsomewhat prior to his death. He then traced the principle of progressin the dealings of God with his people, since the rise of the church especially in reference to Baptisms for the dead, The calling of Elders to preach the Gospel &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff has noticed that all Hell had been opposed to the Priesthood ever since the rise this church and where is the man whose works speak more favorably than Pres.t is the man whose works speak more favorably than Pres.t Young, yet he is not without falt, neither is any other man perfect, we are called to legislate for the best interests of the people, we have not got the light we might have as Apostles, Elders &c   but bring forward your good men that will guard the liberties of the people, this is a good place to select them, and he would vote for them.  This is an important time and we have got to build up the Kingdom of God, no matter what Congress may do, nor how many bills they may pass.Let us reason together, and have the Spirit of God for we are the only friends that God has got, therefore let us be faithful and unite together and maintain our position in these mountains 
 Elder W. Woodruff stated that inasmuch as Dr Benedich is a member of the church, should he not be dealt with for lying about their his brethrenHe also suggested the propriety of getting up a ticket here to night& Elder Orson Pratt seconded the suggestion carried unanimously 
 Elder Woodruff made some remarks about the Municipal Elec-tion to-day in which he gave his views about those who suffered their names to stand in oppossition to the expressed wish of the saints and be voted for by our enemies. 
 Elders John Taylor & W. Woodruff ventilated the subject at considerable length,showing the absolute necessity of ^for^ a change in our Temporal matters, in order to unite and bind us together as a community, or we will never have power among the Nations, this Dispensation comprizes in it, every good principle that existed in all past dispensations. Celestial Law & Baptism for the dead were revealed just at the right time, so the Order of Enock comes along when circumstances that now surround us, demand a change in our social policy. 
 Prest. Wells & Elder Woodruff each bore testimony to the remarkable quality of our soil, especially adapted to the growth of wheat, having tested for a thousand years and received the washings from these mountains, each gave some timely council to the cultivators of the soil shewing the necessity of replenishing it I with manure to prevent its entire exhaustion of the Wheat element, as was the case in some countries, where wheat used to be grown in great quantitites, now they cannot grow a bushel, we have in this Territory some of the choicest virgin soil in the world, but and needs care and cultureto preserve it - 
 Elder W Woodruff  said there never was anything revealed to this people, as raised the Devil so universally as this united orderand no one who either acts as Ananias did, or tries to safe draw off and throw cold water upon it, ^but^ what little sap there is, will run out of them. He 
 Mt. Pleasant UtahJune 24 + 1898President W. Woodruff -and CouncilorsS L City,Dear Brethren:--As I did not have the opportunity of seeing youwhen I called at your Office last week when I returnedfrom my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper towrite you and give you a brief report of theMission and the labor performed there during the lasttwo years.  During those years there have been onan average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives inthe field and when I left here there were 150.According to the reports received there has been some 200,000Families visited by our Elders, and about the same numberof tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls havebeen added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averagesfrom 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in thosenorthern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especiallyon this advanced in years, not so much on account 
 of extreme cold, as on account of the damp and heavyatmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of menthere now past 60 and where they have to take theirchances in the field in common write others it is almostmore than they are able to stand.The Elders have with scarsely an exception labored dilligently and with good success and the blessings and powerof god have followed them in their ministry.  We have onvarious occasions seen the power of God made manifestin a remarkable manner.  The sick have beenrestored to health where they in some instances hadbeen lying on their beds of affliction for many yearsand to all human appearance there was but little orno hope for their recovery.-We have met with but very little interference fromgovernment officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has beento respect and honor those to whom honor was due, andto observe the laws of the countries where we were laboringand exercise love and charity for all and malice towardnone, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect.On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banishedfrom Denmark, this was done on complaints centeredby the Ministers of the State Church who thought theywere annoying them by their presence.-- 
 under those circumstances we have simply transferedthem to Sweden or Norway.Some 300 have emigrated from that mission duringthe past two years, and nearly all on money sent themby their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have beeninstructed not to encourage Emigration, but ratherencourage the Saints to remain and help to build up andstrengthen the branches of the Church where they arehas proven a great benefit to our work in thoselands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives areamong our very best missionariesWe have encouraged the Saints everywhere, althoughpoor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard manyenspiring testimonies from them how the Lord hasmade good His promises and blessed them as a rewardfor their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinaviado not seem to be so hospitable as are the people ofthe U S hence our Elders find it very difficultto travel without money, but as a rule the managerto get along with a little.  The general feeling andSpirit among the people is more liberal and tolerantthen years go, and the prejudin so strong andpronmuced against us in early days, is muchmodified.  One great drawback to our work in 
 the cities is the want of suitable, and I may say respectable, places where to hold our religious serviceswe have encouraged a bettering of conditions in thatline.  We have in all the Conferences and in manyof the principle branches, good choirs provided withorgans, and they are a great help to our work,but we have been much in need of men of talentin that line. -The Gospel is more and more attracting the attentionof the more intelligent and better classes of the peopleand there is at present an exellent prospect forthe work in Scandinavia.  I am not enclined toshare in the sentiment often expressed by ourElders: that the harvest is over and we are butgleaning, but rather think that the precious seedsown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest -The mission was a few years ago involved ina heavy debt, part of that was canceled by PrestP. Sundwall, my predecessor, and I am pleasedto be able ^now^ to report the mission out of debt and ina good footing financially as well as otherwise. 
 #2Elder George Christensen, who has been by your appointedto take charge of the mission temporarly, has laboredwith me in the office for the past two years, partof the time as writer and translator for the danishStar, and has rendered me very valuable assistance,he is a young man of exceptional abilities, and wellqualified for the position he now fills. - We are also publishing a Star in the Swedishlanguage, of which Elder Geo, A. Brandt of Salinais the writer and translator. -Personally I feel pleased to return to my familyfriends at home, and find all well --.My mission has been full of interest andexperiences to me and I trust it has been of courseprofit to the work of God and the people among whereI have labored.Hoping that this brief Statement may take the place ofa personal report and be thus accepted by youI have the honor to subscribe myself--Your Brother in the GospelC. N. Lundover 
 P. S. I here inclose financial Statement -You will see that although this notes inyour Office is connected in our favor.Should they be worthless, we are not relyingupon them, we can throw them all out ifnecessary and be on the square anyhow.but likely something will be realized fromthem.Lund -Excellent report.

His field of labor wasSolvarbo Branch in Dalarne, where he, in connection withElder Lennberg, has performed a good work, laboringthere until death call him hence.A day or two before his death he separated from ElderLen^n^berg, making an appointment to meet him a few dayslater. Elder Bj rkman remained in Solvarbo to preparethe report of the Branch to be forwarded to Stockholm.On the 19th of Aug, he seemed to be in his usual healthand partook of dinner with the family of Saints with whom he was staying. After dinner he went with theminto the field where the work of harvesting was going on.

Hastening to his side, theyfound him apparently lifeless, and all attemp^t^s toarouse him proved in vain. A physician was then sum-moned who after a brief examination, pronounced himdead, ^and gave as the cause a bursting of a bloodvessel in the head,^ stating that death had come without pain.As Solvarbo is located in a sparsely settled andmountainous region some 130 miles from Stockholm, meansof communication are very primitive, and two days lapsedbefore the Saints could find his partner, Elder Lennberg,who, when found, wired the sad news to Stockholm andthence it was forwarded here. A letter was sent fromhere to the Office at Liverpool, containing the news; butwe waited for further particulars before sending the word home, as we did not know where he died, northe address of his family, or whether word had beensent to them from Sweden. Further particulars couldnot be had here until the Brethren from Stockholm reachedthe scene of his death, which necessarily consumed considerabletime. Upon receipt of the first news from Solvarbo wewired you, and having just now received a completeaccount of the death and funeral, forward you same.As soon as Bro.

 President W. Woodruff. I desire to make a few remarks, with the President's permission. Theordinance of washing of feet was introduced byJoseph associated with the School of the Prophets;there was also a washing of feet connected withthe endowments given in the Kirtland Templewhich was continued until the time the Saintsleft there. In Nauvoo, he introduced theendowments we are receiving to-day.I agree with President Taylor's views withregard to our giving endowments. I do thinkwe should be more cautious and careful whowe receive into our Endowment House to givethem full endowments. With regard to givinga portion thereof, and then letting candidatesprove themselves worthy before receiving therest, that of course is a matter to be left toPrest. Taylor. I do not believe, however, thata man should be allowed to go into thathouse who does not pay tithing, and whodrinks and curses and swears.President Taylor. And breaks the Sabbath dayPresident Woodruff. Yes, sir; a man who breaksthe Sabbath day has no business there. 
 1883-09-28President W Woodruff: I want to say tothe First Presidency that we havebeen together as a quorum since thismornings meeting except for one hour.We have had a free and full talkupon our individual affairs--uponour family matters, thupon the word ofwisdom, the duties and responsibilitiesthat devolve upon us as apostles &c.And we have come to the conclusionthat we will now fully observe the Wordof Wisdom as we have all more or lessbeen negligent upon that point, that wewill conduct our personal lives and the 
 affairs of our families in a moreconsistent manner in the future ^and^ inconformity with our calling andhigh profession as apostles of theLord Jesus Christ.  ThatWe have examinedinto the reported crimniality of BrotherCarrington while in England, and havehad a full explanation from him ofthose matters, and find there is nocriminality to be attached to him yet hewas very unwise and imprudent in hiscourse while abroad which might havehavegiven cause for grave suspicions.Bro Carrington ^is^ also convinced that his conductwas not such as became consistent withhis calling as an apostle.Bro John W Young has also expressed hisdesires to more fully live up to the requirements 
 of his religion and to magnify hiscalling. Hence we havepassed upon and accepted each ofthe members of our quorum who havebeen with us dto day and nowpresent, and now submit ourselvesand our action for the consideration ofthe First Presidency. 
 ^Apostle^ W. Woodruff, Endorsed ^the^ teachings ofPresident Taylor. Felt a change wascoming on the church and ^on^ the world spoke of ^the greatness of^ coming eventsfor which a people had to be prepared,and that revelation would be given tofit us for the work, and to stand inthe midst of the judgments, or else wego down with the rest ^of the world^. We ought towake up, and ^get our^our hearts set upon thebuilding up of the Kingdom of God. Then 
 President W. Woodruff said this meetinghad been called for a purpose that wouldhereafter be revealed. It would requirethe brethren to keep their own council.There are ordinances in this house that aresacred and should not be revealed. All theordinances are sacred, and we must learnto keep our own councils.A note was then taken not to reveal any thing 
 there would be no lack of means. Feltlike Pres. Taylor there would have to be a change in the giving of endownments.Refd where prayer of Joseph and the answerhereto ^to be found in the Book of Doctrine & Covenants,^ with its complete fulfillment. ^He continued,^ I believethat this priesthood has power with theheavens, Our man power-slaves Somecalled us slaves, why do we submit toour leaders, because we know what theyare controlled of God and empowered byhim; we are no more slaves, than itcould be consistintly said that Gabriel,Michael & other ^angels^ are slaves to God. in Thepriesthood will prevail, as the world willfind out. God has not stopped givingrevelation; Revelation regarding workin the temples for our dead &c WhenIsrael rises up ^& lives their religion^ then we shall nothave trouble about glory [shaps] &c 
 that should transpire in our meeting.,which was carried unanimously.Prest Woodruff said that the time hadcome for us to enter a higher plane andto understand the further ordinances ofthe Kingdom of God. He asked if therewas any present who had not obeyedand entered into the law of God (pluralmarriage).There wasere none present who had not en-tered into this covenant.Prest Woodruff then gave instructions uponthe necessity of keeping the Word of Widsomand to k.eep their ^of preserving order in our^ families. in order ^He urged the brethren to^ To be kind to their families and just in alltheir relations with their wives and familes. We should all obey the law ofTithing and observe all the law ofGod, acting consistently in all our doingsgave instructions on the Word of Wisdomthe necessity of observing it in its fullspirit and meaning, showing thenecessity of overcoming all our badhabits and to be ^of being^ obedient to the requirements of the Almighty.

 President W. Woodruff had not saidanything about the school of the Pro-phets intending to have asked the bre-thren of their standing, but as ithad been spoken of he would saythere had been an attempt to es-tablish a school of the prophetsbut men could not keep their owncouncil, they betrayed their trust 
 Prest Woodruff spoke of the difficultiesexisting in families and difficultiesthat we could not always controle inour families as we could wish andunless there was something very seriouswe should have some charity andgave some very excellent council.bore testimony concerning the integ-rity of Bro Bleak 
 It is necessary to have men whocan keep the law of God and liveetheir religion, being exemplary menand true to thier covenantsApostle Teasdale felt truly thankful to Godfor this privilege of meeting with thebrethren in this room. In the past ithas seemed impossible to keep our owncounsels some one would betray, but weought surely to know to keep our covenants, our own counsels, God will notteach us in these schools unless we keepthese things to ourselves for they are sacredWe must honor the law of God.  We aresurely slothful if we have been in thechurch for some time and have notobeyed the law of plural marreage.  Wemust have order in our families bretherenbe candid speak your feelings freely,preach the gospel by example. ^Let us^ love each other as ourselves, not speak evilagainst the Lord's anointed, exerciserighteous dominion over our familiesand God's heritage, and overcome andkeep the whole law of God.

We have heardyou express yourselves. you have ganied agreat victory in overcoming your habits &c. TheLord requires us to keep the Word of Wisdom according to the best of our ability.

 school in Salt Lake it is the only oneat present.  Before I left in conversingwith President Taylor I was permitted toorganize a school at St. George, by for-warding athe list of names to him for theapproval of the Presidency.  Plural mar-riage and the word of Wisdom weretwo important principles to be observedin order to stand in this holy order.He then called for an expression of the feel-ings and status of the bretheren presentBp. Marius Ensign had tried to live these principles and was in harmon with and rejoicedin these principles and the privilege of thismeeting. 
 The brethren then retired to behindthe veil and were introduced by PrestSnow to Prest Wilford Woodruff whostood on the steps beside the standwith uplifted handsPrest Woodruff, "Art thou brethren?
