 [sideways text] E. H. Anderson, 13 March 1891. [end of sideways text]  Agust 29  Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn March 13 1891  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  We need thirty missionaries for the Scandinavian Mission as early as possible in the Fall of 1891. As to nationality and dialect, they should be divided as follows: Danish, 8: for Stockholm and Goteborg, Sweden, 12; for Skane, Sweden, 4; for Christiania, Norway, 6.  Our progress during the past four months, has averaged that of the past two winters. A number of the older brethren, however, have been unable to work, owing to sickness, which has crippled our work some. As far as I know; all are now well.  The present edition of the Danish Hymn Book is nearly exhausted, and before a new edition is published, the work should be carefully revised, which should be done so that we could send it to press next winter. I think this labor is of great importance, as it is a fact that our hymns have a great influence in spread- ing the truth, and numbers of people have been con- verted by hearing and reading our songs. I suggest, therefore, that a committee of interested and capable Scandinavians be selected to do the revising, which, to save expence, should be done at home in Utah, and the work sent over here for publication.  To make it what it should be, there are a number of improvements needed 
 in the book which will be fully apparent to those who undertake the task. The meter should be changed in  a number of the songs so as to make these suitable for our psalmody music instead of the folk-lore melodys now used, which are often very inappropriate in a house of worship; and more of the principles and doctrines should be treated upon with less of Zion and the gathering, which latter not only the Saints, but even strangers are often too eager to embrace. A considerable proportion of those who emigrate each year are Gentiles, and our people are continually sending for their friends who care nothing in a num- ber of instances, for the Gospel, but often prove of great injury to the cause by returning unfavorable writings to these lands, after they are gathered.  Elders J. M. Sjodahl, P. O. Thomasen, and C. C. A. Chris- tensen would be among the best that could be found to do the work of revision, or to supervise it, with the  assistance of such other talent as might be selected. Elder C. E. Thorstensen, a good choir leader, who is now working in this office, but who expects to return home  next Fall, would be of much assistance in the work owing to his musical ability, and his familiarity with the wants of choirs and singers in this mission.  Hoping that these matters will received your favorable consideration, and praying God to bless you abundantly, I remain,  Your brother in the Gospel of Christ, Edw. H. Anderson. 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzengade Nr. 14, 1. Sal. Kjebenhavn Nov. 8 1890  President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother: I have just made a round tour of this  mission, leaving here on Oct. 4th, and returning on the 3d of the present month. I have sent Prest.  Young an account in detail of our conferences, and of matters as I found them. The work is progress- ing quite favorably in this mission, and especially do we find many in Northern Sweden who investi- gate the principles of the Gospel. During the past six months there have been 312 baptisms in the  mission.  We will need 20 missionaries next spring,  which should be divided as follows:  Danes 5; from Stockholm or Goteborg, North- ern Sweden 7; from S Kane, southern Sweden  4; from Norway 4,. We can not use South- ern Swedes for the north part of that country; and as the northern portion is the best field we hope to have the full quota for that part as early as they can be sent over; in fact, it would be well if they were now in the field.  I take the liberty of suggesting that we 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn 189  need a Danish writer and a Swedish writer, to relieve the brethren who are now laboring in that  calling. It is well to have them on hand, so as to familiarize themselves with their work, some length of time before the present laborers leave. I suggest as the Danish translator Elder O. J. Anderson, of Castle Dale, Emery Co. and as the Swedish translator,  Elder Charles Kallstrom of Logan. These brethren should be here early in the summer. We need also some specially qualified men to relieve the  Conference presidents who will return next sum- mer and fall. I suggest the following names from which a selection could be made:  Danes: Jos. Christiansen, Mayfield SanpeteCo. Dr. Chr: Madsen, Salina, SevierCo. John Christophersen, Richmond CacheCo. I. C. Thoresen, Hyrum, Cache Co.  Swedes: Hugo Peterson, Salt Lake City.  Charles Nyman, Logan.  John Bowman, Jr. Monroe, Sevier Co. C. A. Carlquist, Salt Lake City  Norwegians: C. H. Monsan, Richmond, Cache Chr: Bouderud, Salina, Sevier Co. Ingebrigt Paulsen, Salina Hans A. Petersen, Logan. 
 Den skandinaviske Missions Kontor. Lorentzensgade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn 189  Among these, I will name I. C. Thoresen, Hyrum;  Jes. Christiansen Mayfield; C. A. Carlquist Salt Lake City; and C. H. Monsen, Richmond, as men who would be good laborers in the field and who could hold responsible po- sitions.  Trusting that these suggestions may not be out of place, and that the subject may receive the consideration that its importance  demands, I remain,  Your humble brother in the cause of God,  Edw. H. Anderson  P.S. I would like to know as early as possible  in relation to the translators, as we have here- tofore found it difficult to get them here on time.  E. H. A

 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hoveddkontor for den skandinaviske Mission Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn, Mar. 7. 1893  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City,  Utah  Dear Brother:  I herewith enclose a list of names of persons recommended as being quali- fied and capable of filling missions in Scan- dinavia, and if you deem it proper we would be pleased to have them called and sent to these countries to assist in the work of the Lord. I sent a similar list to Prest. Young at Liver- pool on the 9th Jan., but for some cause it can not now be found there, and, having been mislaid, it has not been forwarded to you.  It is therefore by the suggestion of Prest. Young, or the brother at Liverpool having charge of the mission, that I send this list direct to you.  It is now very late, but these Elders were intended to have been among the Spring supply of missionaries. You have no doubt by this time been informed of the number of needed for Scandinavia -- 30, (12 Swedes, 8 [Norwegians ] and 10 Danes.)  By request of Prest. Young, I also send you a list of notes due this office from parties most by residing in Utah.  These amounts have been loaned to the respective parties on their promise of paying same as specified in the notes; some 
 2  De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hoveddkontor for den skandinaviske Mission Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn, _______ 189__.  of these accounts are now nearly ten years old, and, to judge from the past, they will never be paid if left in this office.  I would suggest, that these notes be sent to the church office in Salt Lake City for collection, and this office, if possible, get credit for the a- mounts, as the Scandinavian Mission can ill afford to do without the means.  No doubt if the notes are presented for collection at home, the greater portion at least will be paid, but if left here, it is very doubtful. This money was borrowed from amounts on hand here for emigrations purposes, and, besides this amount, we have a borrowed balance from the same source of Kr. 6827.25 or L379.5 "  9 3/4 (about $1845.00)  By this you can judge of our financial condition, and any disposition you can make in favor of the mission is greatly need- ed and will be thankfully received.  Awaiting your favor, I remain, Your brother in the Gospel, Joseph Christiansen Prest. Scand. Mission

 Wilford Woodruff made remarks of a  similar character. This work cannot stand  still, it must go forward or go backward. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the necessity of pruning  the tree off the dead branches from the tree, and those who  would not pay their tithing, did not deserve the fellowship of the saints, and ought to be cut off 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the best time for Farmers to pay their tithing  was at the time they raise their produce, before they put it away in their  bins and cellars - 
 Elder Woodruff mentioned an instance in his experience  while with Elder Patten, who on one occasion, when the people had rejected their testimony washed their  feet, as a testimony against them; he did know  that God backed up and sustained the testimony of the lessor  priesthood, but the power spoken of in the section just read he thought was of a more special character, than that  commonly held by ^all^ Elders who go forth to preach the gospel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff bore testimony to the truth of Pres.t. Wells re- marks and named an instance of bearing testimony  to a number of individuals, especially one who had once  held the priesthood &c and apostatized, he was constrained by  the spirit to go and warn him three times, the man was coming  towards him, and fell dead at his feet. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said it was very plain, that the  judgments of God commenced upon the inhabitants  of this wicked world after the introduction of  the Gospel especially this and other civilized or  ^Christian^ nations this is according to all the revelations we have  on the subject. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said, all the outside world were  united in fighting against Zion and the great  work of the Almighty God had to be carried out by  the handful of people in these vallies and if  we have not faith enough as yet, to enter into the  Order of Enock, we surely have sufficient to enter  upon an effort of co operation, like the one suggested.  We are too anxious to get rich as a people, and  get Railroad stock, or Bank stock &c 
  Elder W. Woodruff said he did not believe either ^in^ one or  the other of those doctrines. but he did believe that many  who went in the spirit world, who will receive the Gospel and enter into the Celestial Kingdom and moreover  that those who have had one wife sealed to them  over the Alter, and should die before they had a chance  to obtain a second, would certainly be entitled to a  Celestial Glory. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that while he acted under the Aaronic  priesthood, as a priest, God manifested his power quite as much  as since he held the Apostleship, he gave him dreams and  visions &c, no matter what priesthood a man may hold, if he  magnified it, God would own and bless him under it. 
  Elder W. Woodruff ^said^ that he did not think it wisdom to have our  minds exercised about any matter that revelation was silent upon, and as to whether or not, the high priesthood was enjoyed  between the time of Moses and the Saviour, did not really  concern us, as we had many pressing duties that should engage  our attention in preference. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt very thankful for the changes that  are now being made, especially in the Temporal affairs of the  Kingdom of God, a vast amount of responsibilites had been  upon the shoulders of Prest Young for a long time as the leading  Spirit of all the great enterprizes in our midst, such as  the Railroad, Zions Coope Merchantile Instn, The Bank &c. He felt that the Kingdom of God was moving onward at a very  rapid ^rate^, hence the necessity of new offices, and more good  men being called into active service, not only in Temporal  but spiritual things. Was much pleased with the Patriarchal  Ordination being extended to others, to meet the growing wants  of the people. 
 Elder W Woodruff spoke of the drivings and fightings of  the Indians by the Government, the hand of the Lord was  over that people, there is a great work for them to do in  building up Zion & the new Jerusalem, they will certainly  be inspired, and ^receive^ revelations from God, and we who have  come into the Gospel a little before them, and we should  exerciise faith for them, and pray for them. A few days  us after they came into the Vallies, they saw a few Indians  who came to their camp, and they gave them some bread 
 since that time, we have grown and the Lord has blest us,  and the Indians are better fed and clothed than they were.  we have many duties to perform towards the Indians. God alone is our friend and the Lamanites around us, had  they li not been a portion of the House Indians of Israel  they would have been cut off root and branch long ago they are of the seed of Joseph, and God requires us to look  after their salvation. He Prophesied in the name of the  name of the Lord Jesus Christ that this Government ^or nation^ was nearly  ripe for the Damnation of Hell. He spoke of the  first Elders of the Church who had been taken away, for a wise  purpose, it was necessary for an organization in this dispensation  behind the vail, he believes that Joseph had lived his time  out until done his work. Let us do right, build up Zion, and  establish the Kingdom. Keep the commandments of God, and no  earthly power can drive us from these vallies. 
 Elder W Woodruff felt satisfied that very many of our people  do not pay their tithing, he kept an account of his money receipts  and the products of the earth, and paid a tenth of each  the law of tithing was of God, and none can neglect it without  suffering loss, it has never been annulled, and has been in  existance ever since the days of Adam, we shall prosper by  Keeping the commandments of God, and visa, versa. 
 Elder W Woodruff said there was a great contrast  between the laws, refered to and the Celestial law  as given through the Gospel, if the eyes of the people  of this City were opened, they would be more alive to  their duties, and would hunger and thirst after righteos- ness. We are living under great priveleges, and have had  many keys and principles pertaining to the living and the  dead - he denounced the fashions of the Babylon which are so  eagerly sought after by our Wives and Daughters -  We have a great amount of preaching and are more or less  responsible for this privelege.  Many of the Elders are giving way  to Smoking & Drinking &c which he was sorry to see. 
 nan 
 Elder W. Woodruff  spoke of the opposing element to the priesthood from the days of Joseph until  now, the many excellent traits of character in Prest Young, as coined by his works, the necessity of  wise legislation, by good men, to be of good courage, do right, be faithful and united, then Congress  and her many bills cannot hurt us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff also adverted to the unreliability of memory especially  after a great lapse of time since the sayings had been made  he himself has written a great many sayings and sermons of Joseph  Smith, but when once written they invariably left his memory.  The Lord lead and instructed the Prophet Joseph like a child  and many things he was taught, he had but a very imperfect understanding at first, his on the resurection changed somewhat prior to his death. He then traced the principle of progress in the dealings of God with his people, since the rise of the church  especially in reference to Baptisms for the dead, The calling of Elders  to preach the Gospel &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff has noticed that all Hell had  been opposed to the Priesthood ever since the rise this church  and where is the man whose works speak more favorably  than Pres.t is the man whose works speak more favorably  than Pres.t Young, yet he is not without falt, neither  is any other man perfect, we are called to legislate for  the best interests of the people, we have not got the  light we might have as Apostles, Elders &c   but bring  forward your good men that will guard the liberties of the  people, this is a good place to select them, and he would  vote for them.  This is an important time and we have  got to build up the Kingdom of God, no matter what  Congress may do, nor how many bills they may pass. Let us reason together, and have the Spirit of God  for we are the only friends that God has got, therefore let  us be faithful and unite together and maintain our  position in these mountains 
 Elder W. Woodruff stated  that inasmuch as Dr Benedich  is a member of the church,  should he not be dealt with  for lying about their his  brethren  He also suggested the  propriety of getting up  a ticket here to night & Elder Orson Pratt  seconded the suggestion  carried unanimously 
 Elder Woodruff made some remarks about the Municipal Elec- tion to-day in which he gave his views about those who suffered  their names to stand in oppossition to the expressed wish of the saints  and be voted for by our enemies. 
 Elders John Taylor & W. Woodruff ventilated the subject at considerable length, showing the absolute necessity of ^for^ a change in our Temporal matters, in order to unite  and bind us together as a community, or we will never have power  among the Nations, this Dispensation comprizes in it, every good principle that  existed in all past dispensations. Celestial Law & Baptism for the dead  were revealed just at the right time, so the Order of Enock comes along  when circumstances that now surround us, demand a change in our  social policy. 
 Prest. Wells & Elder Woodruff each bore testimony to the remarkable  quality of our soil, especially adapted to the growth of wheat, having  tested for a thousand years and received the washings from these mountains,  each gave some timely council to the cultivators of the soil  shewing the necessity of replenishing it I with manure to prevent  its entire exhaustion of the Wheat element, as was the case in some  countries, where wheat used to be grown in great quantitites,  now they cannot grow a bushel, we have in this Territory some  of the choicest virgin soil in the world, but and needs care and culture to preserve it - 
 Elder W Woodruff  said there never was anything  revealed to this people, as raised the Devil so  universally as this united order and no one who either acts as Ananias did,  or tries to safe draw off and throw cold water  upon it, ^but^ what little sap there is, will run out of  them. He 
 Mt. Pleasant Utah June 24 + 1898  President W. Woodruff - and Councilors S L City, Dear Brethren:--  As I did not have the opportunity of seeing you when I called at your Office last week when I returned from my mission to Scandinavia's I deem it proper to write you and give you a brief report of the Mission and the labor performed there during the last two years.  During those years there have been on an average 125 Utah Elders and 4 or 5 natives in the field and when I left here there were 150. According to the reports received there has been some 200,000 Families visited by our Elders, and about the same number of tracts distributed, and over one thousand souls have been added to the church.  The ages of theElders there averages from 18 to 73.  We find that the climate in those northern lands is very trying on our Brethren, especially on this advanced in years, not so much on account 
 of extreme cold, as on account of the damp and heavy atmosphere, rain and fog.  We have a number of men there now past 60 and where they have to take their chances in the field in common write others it is almost more than they are able to stand.  The Elders have with scarsely an exception labored dilligently  and with good success and the blessings and power of god have followed them in their ministry.  We have on various occasions seen the power of God made manifest in a remarkable manner.  The sick have been restored to health where they in some instances had been lying on their beds of affliction for many years and to all human appearance there was but little or no hope for their recovery.-  We have met with but very little interference from government officials or from the clergy.  Our motto has been to respect and honor those to whom honor was due, and to observe the laws of the countries where we were laboring and exercise love and charity for all and malice toward none, hence we have been treated ^with^ courtesy and respect. On One or two occasions some of our Elders were banished from Denmark, this was done on complaints centered by the Ministers of the State Church who thought they were annoying them by their presence.-- 
 under those circumstances we have simply transfered them to Sweden or Norway.  Some 300 have emigrated from that mission during the past two years, and nearly all on money sent them by their friends in Utah.  The fact that we have been instructed not to encourage Emigration, but rather encourage the Saints to remain and help to build up and strengthen the branches of the Church where they are has proven a great benefit to our work in those lands, as the good Saints who live exemplary lives are among our very best missionaries  We have encouraged the Saints everywhere, although poor, to pay their tithing, and we have heard many enspiring testimonies from them how the Lord has made good His promises and blessed them as a reward for their faithfulness.  The people in Scandinavia do not seem to be so hospitable as are the people of the U S hence our Elders find it very difficult to travel without money, but as a rule the manager to get along with a little.  The general feeling and Spirit among the people is more liberal and tolerant then years go, and the prejudin so strong and pronmuced against us in early days, is much modified.  One great drawback to our work in 
 the cities is the want of suitable, and I may say  respectable, places where to hold our religious services we have encouraged a bettering of conditions in that line.  We have in all the Conferences and in many of the principle branches, good choirs provided with organs, and they are a great help to our work, but we have been much in need of men of talent in that line. -  The Gospel is more and more attracting the attention of the more intelligent and better classes of the people and there is at present an exellent prospect for the work in Scandinavia.  I am not enclined to share in the sentiment often expressed by our Elders: that the harvest is over and we are but gleaning, but rather think that the precious seed sown in our day will yet bear a rich harvest - The mission was a few years ago involved in a heavy debt, part of that was canceled by Prest P. Sundwall, my predecessor, and I am pleased to be able ^now^ to report the mission out of debt and in a good footing financially as well as otherwise. 
 #2  Elder George Christensen, who has been by your appointed to take charge of the mission temporarly, has labored with me in the office for the past two years, part of the time as writer and translator for the danish Star, and has rendered me very valuable assistance, he is a young man of exceptional abilities, and well qualified for the position he now fills. -  We are also publishing a Star in the Swedish language, of which Elder Geo, A. Brandt of Salina is the writer and translator. -  Personally I feel pleased to return to my family friends at home, and find all well --.  My mission has been full of interest and experiences to me and I trust it has been of course profit to the work of God and the people among where I have labored.  Hoping that this brief Statement may take the place of a personal report and be thus accepted by you  I have the honor to subscribe myself--  Your Brother in the Gospel C. N. Lund  over 
 P. S. I here inclose financial Statement - You will see that although this notes in your Office is connected in our favor. Should they be worthless, we are not relying upon them, we can throw them all out if necessary and be on the square anyhow. but likely something will be realized from them. Lund -  Excellent report.

Bj rkman, who died ^in^ 19 inst. at Solvarbo, Sweden, Chaving now received full particulars, we deem it proper to forward same to you. A full account of his labors, death and burial has been sent to his family.  Elder Andrew Bj rkman was born in Bj rklinge, Upland, Sweden, Jan. 22, 1838. ^He^ Rreceived the Gospel, by Baptism, May 18, 1864, and emigrated to Utah in 1869. He arrived here as a Missionary, June 29, 1895, and was appointed by Pres. Sunduvall to labor in Stockholm Conference. His field of labor was Solvarbo Branch in Dalarne, where he, in connection with Elder Lennberg, has performed a good work, laboring there until death call him hence.  A day or two before his death he separated from Elder Len^n^berg, making an appointment to meet him a few days later. Elder Bj rkman remained in Solvarbo to prepare the report of the Branch to be forwarded to Stockholm.  On the 19th of Aug, he seemed to be in his usual health and partook of dinner with the family of Saints with  whom he was staying. After dinner he went with them into the field where the work of harvesting was going on.

Kjobenhavn, 189  3  Keep clean 4 6 Min #2  A few minutes later, a member of the family discovered him lying on the ground. Hastening to his side, they found him apparently lifeless, and all attemp^t^s to arouse him proved in vain. A physician was then sum- moned who after a brief examination, pronounced him dead, ^and gave as the cause a bursting of a bloodvessel in the head,^ stating that death had come without pain.  As Solvarbo is located in a sparsely settled and mountainous region some 130 miles from Stockholm, means of communication are very primitive, and two days lapsed before the Saints could find his partner, Elder Lennberg, who, when found, wired the sad news to Stockholm and thence it was forwarded here. A letter was sent from here to the Office at Liverpool, containing the news; but we waited for further particulars before sending the  word home, as we did not know where he died, nor the address of his family, or whether word had been sent to them from Sweden. Further particulars could not be had here until the Brethren from Stockholm reached the scene of his death, which necessarily consumed considerable time. Upon receipt of the first news from Solvarbo we wired you, and having just now received a complete account of the death and funeral, forward you same.  As soon as Bro. Ahlquist, President of Stockholm Conference, and the Elders with him arrived, necessary steps were imme- diately taken for the funeral, Temple clothing having been prepared

At 4 o'clock, Aug. 25 1896 the funeral services were commenced, a congretation of about 200 persons, mostly strangers,  having gathered in to pay their last respects to Bro. Bj rkman. The services were conducted as on such occassions at home.  The speakers were Elders C. A. Ahlquist, O. E. Olson, A. Petersen and E. Lennberg, all from Zion, who all spoke feelingly of the excellent qualities of the deceased, and bore powerful testimonies to the large assembly.  After the dedicatory prayer had been offered by Pres. Ahlquist, the mortal remains of Elder Bj rkman were consigned to the silent tomb. He lies buried in a lovely spot in the Gustafs Cemetery in Dalarne, Sweden. Much credit is due to Pres. Ahlquist and the Brethren with him, who did all in their power that Brother Bj rkman might be laid to rest in a proper man- ner, befitting a servant of God.  While we would ^have liked^ very much ^had^ liked to have been present at the funeral of our Brother, the information as to where he died, and where and when he would be buried, did not reach us in time, the distance from here being some over 500 miles, and we felt sure that that the Brethren who were there would do all that could be done.  It is very sad that one of our brethren should thus

 President W. Woodruff. I desire to make a  few remarks, with the President's permission. The ordinance of washing of feet was introduced by Joseph associated with the School of the Prophets; there was also a washing of feet connected with the endowments given in the Kirtland Temple which was continued until the time the Saints left there. In Nauvoo, he introduced the endowments we are receiving to-day.  I agree with President Taylor's views with regard to our giving endowments. I do think we should be more cautious and careful who we receive into our Endowment House to give them full endowments. With regard to giving a portion thereof, and then letting candidates prove themselves worthy before receiving the rest, that of course is a matter to be left to Prest. Taylor. I do not believe, however, that a man should be allowed to go into that house who does not pay tithing, and who drinks and curses and swears.  President Taylor. And breaks the Sabbath day  President Woodruff. Yes, sir; a man who breaks the Sabbath day has no business there. 
 1883-09-28  President W Woodruff: I want to say to the First Presidency that we have been together as a quorum since this mornings meeting except for one hour. We have had a free and full talk upon our individual affairs--upon our family matters, thupon the word of wisdom, the duties and responsibilities that devolve upon us as apostles &c. And we have come to the conclusion that we will now fully observe the Word of Wisdom as we have all more or less been negligent upon that point, that we will conduct our personal lives and the 
 affairs of our families in a more consistent manner in the future ^and^ in conformity with our calling and high profession as apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.  ThatWe have examined into the reported crimniality of Brother Carrington while in England, and have had a full explanation from him of those matters, and find there is no criminality to be attached to him yet he was very unwise and imprudent in his course while abroad which might have havegiven cause for grave suspicions.  Bro Carrington ^is^ also convinced that his conduct was not such as became consistent with his calling as an apostle.  Bro John W Young has also expressed his desires to more fully live up to the requirements 
 of his religion and to magnify his calling. Hence we have passed upon and accepted each of the members of our quorum who have been with us dto day and now present, and now submit ourselves and our action for the consideration of the First Presidency. 
 ^Apostle^ W. Woodruff, Endorsed ^the^ teachings of President Taylor. Felt a change was coming on the church and ^on^ the  world spoke of ^the greatness of^ coming events for which a people had to be prepared, and that revelation would be given to fit us for the work, and to stand in the midst of the judgments, or else we go down with the rest ^of the world^. We ought to wake up, and ^get our^our hearts set upon the building up of the Kingdom of God. Then 
 President W. Woodruff said this meeting had been called for a purpose that would hereafter be revealed. It would require the brethren to keep their own council. There are ordinances in this house that are sacred and should not be revealed. All the ordinances are sacred, and we must learn to keep our own councils.  A note was then taken not to reveal any thing 
 there would be no lack of means. Felt like Pres. Taylor there would have to be a  change in the giving of endownments. Refd where prayer of Joseph and the answer hereto ^to be found in the Book of Doctrine & Covenants,^ with its complete fulfillment. ^He continued,^ I believe that this priesthood has power with the heavens, Our man power-slaves Some called us slaves, why do we submit to our leaders, because we know what they are controlled of God and empowered by him; we are no more slaves, than it could be consistintly said that Gabriel, Michael & other ^angels^ are slaves to God. in The priesthood will prevail, as the world will find out.

 that should transpire in our meeting., which was carried unanimously.  Prest Woodruff said that the time had come for us to enter a higher plane and to understand the further ordinances of the Kingdom of God. He asked if there was any present who had not obeyed and entered into the law of God (plural marriage).  There wasere none present who had not en- tered into this covenant.  Prest Woodruff then gave instructions upon the necessity of keeping the Word of Widsom and to k.eep their ^of preserving order in our^ families. in order ^He urged the brethren to^ To be  kind to their families and just in all their relations with their wives and fam iles. We should all obey the law of Tithing and observe all the law of God, acting consistently in all our doings gave instructions on the Word of Wisdom the necessity of observing it in its full spirit and meaning, showing the necessity of overcoming all our bad habits and to be ^of being^ obedient to the require ments of the Almighty.  Spoke of the necessity of our advancing in the Knowledge of God and the principles of eternal life and ^of^tokeep^ing^ oursel- ves pure and virtuous 
 President Woodruff then gave instructions and stated the effects that had follow- ed this ordinance. Spoke upon the shaking off the dust off the feet and washing the feet in pure water in wsummer or winter and the judments of God that had followed  Referred to a revelation that he had had in the wilderness and exhorted the bretheren to dilligence and faithfulness 
 President W. Woodruff had not said anything about the school of the Pro- phets intending to have asked the bre- thren of their standing, but as it had been spoken of he would say there had been an attempt to es- tablish a school of the prophets but men could not keep their own council, they betrayed their trust 
 Prest Woodruff spoke of the difficulties existing in families and difficulties that we could not always controle in our families as we could wish and unless there was something very serious we should have some charity and gave some very excellent council. bore testimony concerning the integ- rity of Bro Bleak 
 It is necessary to have men who can keep the law of God and livee their religion, being exemplary men and true to thier covenants  Apostle Teasdale felt truly thankful to God for this privilege of meeting with the brethren in this room. In the past it has seemed impossible to keep our own counsels some one would betray, but we ought surely to know to keep our coven ants, our own counsels, God will not teach us in these schools unless we keep these things to ourselves for they are sacred We must honor the law of God.  We are surely slothful if we have been in the church for some time and have not obeyed the law of plural marreage.  We must have order in our families bretheren be candid speak your feelings freely, preach the gospel by example. ^Let us^ love  each other as ourselves, not speak evil against the Lord's anointed, exercise righteous dominion over our families and God's heritage, and overcome and keep the whole law of God. Theory will not exalt us, hold each others interest sacred, live so as to keep ourselves clean, and be prepared for the revela- tions of God who has promised to reveal himself.  President Woodruff  We have organized one 
 Pres 3 Woodruff was glad to see this day and time. ^He^ expressed great satisfaction at seeing these brethren making the sacrifices they are making. Instructed the brethren to come together on the morrow in fasting and in pray- er, with clean bodies and garments to have no intercourse with their wives. We have heard you express yourselves. you have ganied a great victory in overcoming your habits &c. The Lord requires us to keep the Word of Wisdom accor ding to the best of our ability. Related his own experience, when it was the time come to quit he quit. He had taken up a labor with himself for the time has come for us to keep the word of wisdom as far as we can before the Lord. Come together at 9 am, &c 
 school in Salt Lake it is the only one at present.  Before I left in conversing with President Taylor I was permitted to organize a school at St. George, by for- warding athe list of names to him for the approval of the Presidency.  Plural mar- riage and the word of Wisdom were two important principles to be observed in order to stand in this holy order.  He then called for an expression of the feel- ings and status of the bretheren present Bp. Marius Ensign had tried to live these prin ciples and was in harmon with and rejoiced in these principles and the privilege of this meeting. 
 The brethren then retired to behind the veil and were introduced by Prest Snow to Prest Wilford Woodruff who stood on the steps beside the stand with uplifted hands  Prest Woodruff, "Art thou brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or rememberance of the Everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, im- movable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God, in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, for ever and ever, Amen."  Prest Snow replied "Art thou a brother? We salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ  &c &c as above 
 The brethren were then listed by age President Woodruff then laid aside his coat & vest, and girded himself with a towell. All things being pre pared, John Lytle, who was the oldest man present, being born on the 18th day of August 1803, then took his seat and President W. Woodruff washed his feet. He said "By virtue of the Holy Priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ I wash thy feet according to an Holy ordinance introduced by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with his disciples when he washed their feet, and told them to wash one 
 anothers, and also by Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Lord, an introductory ordinance to the school of the Prophets, and pronounce thee clean from the blood of this generation, and say unto thee, thy sins are for- given thee, and ^I^ seal and con- firm upon thee all the rights, powers and privileges associated with this ordinance in the author ity of the Holy Presthood and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Amen Then ^Prest Woodruff then^ dried his ^Brother Lytle's^ feet whilset fresh
