I spent A long evening in  conversation with them Elder Hyde wished me to  lay before the Presidency in the valley the situation of affairs in Pottawatamie county Ioway He wished me  to say to them that all the men of capital were leaving for the valley men from the East and England that were able were going to the valley, And all the men that were living thare that were able to make a fit out were  talking of going Another class who were able to get a fit out in part even able to get waggons were  taken out by Bishop Hunter so those that are left are the poorest part of community and if this order of  things is continued A year or two more this county  will be broaken up and the saints will have to scatter abroad the poor who come from the East and England  who are to poor to go through are left upon our hands and oxen are now selling in kanesville from $60 to $100 and when this springs Emigration leaves there will not be left more than one Yoke of oxen to 7 families and the fields would not be ploughed or planted He said He did not think that Kanesville and the surrounding country should be deserted or broaken up but if the Presidency wished it to be so He should not then  object to it. He spoke upon the subject of opening large fields and farming upon a big scale by employing the poor brethren to work upon them this He would like to do if He could be assured that He would not be called away in a year or two after commenceing it. He remarked if the presidency wished to evacuate the place or wished  him to go any whare els He would go. He seemed to  oppose the idea of Having the poor come to Kanesville to stop He thought they had better cstay in the East or at St Louis, than to come Here I make this recoorrd to present  to the Presidency according to his request   Elder O. Pratt wished me to say to the Presidency that there were many Elders in England of power faith and talent who had to labour hard to get bread for there families And when Elders were sent to them from  America who had not talent and could not edify them  they felt it was A tax upon them that there own Elders   ENDENTRY were more capable to Edify them than those that were  sent unto them And when men were sent they should be such as could Edify and instruct. I spent the night at  Brother Pratt 18 miles    ENDENTRY May 19, 1850 ~ Sunday   19th FIGURE According to appointment I met in conference with  Orson Pratt And the High Council near the  stand in the grove, one hour before the general meeting  Elder Hyde Addressed the council in substance as follows That there was business left unfinished at the conference which must be closed to day As osome officers are going to the Johnson was  going Another Bishop must be appointed Also men must be appointed to visit the various branches who would attend the council and carry the spirit of the council to the people  and bring back the spirit of the cPeople to the council. Joseph  Young and Benjamin Clapp who were appointed last Year were not with them at all ieither in Body or spirit and  whenever they did attend A council Joseph Young could  not stay till He went away we will pass them over and  let them go. Elder Hyde also remarked that it was necessa ry to make arangements to receive the poor that had of  late arived among us I have given council through the guardian for the poor not to come here and some have  contrary to this councisl through tha misguided zeal councilled  them to come to this place and such must bear the consequen ces of it. It was voted that A Bishop be appointed to  take the place of Bishop Johnson, and that Elder Stodard  be appointed to travel among the Churches and call such men to his help as He needed. Three men were Appointed as A committe to locate the poor.   We then repaired to the Stand before the congregation and each item of business was presented before the people the same as  before the council And a vote taken upon each item Elder Hyde made many remarks upon each item  as they came up before the people Among other things said that the Priesthood and Saints Held the keys of Blessings in there own hands and said we have not had but one shower of rain this year or since last fall and we have not seen the bow in the Heavens at all this season the earth is parched up and dry now if you want rain  open your doors and receive the poor And you will have the Blessings the people said they would do it and Elder Pratt Prayed for rain. Elder Hyde Also wished  the sin course and evil that arose in that place from the grog shops should rest upon the Head of those who kept  such dogeries and the people said Amen to it   In the Afternoon Elder O. Pratt Preached to the people in an Edifying manner spoke Also against the Grog shops  Also of his travel in England the progress of the work in that  land the many thousands who were coming into the  church the great increase of the publications the opposition that was begining to be manifest against  them spoke of the signs of the times the building   ENDENTRY of the city of Zion the peculiarity of that city having A  pillar of fire by nigh and a cloud by day resting over the Habitations of the saints Elder Pratt spoke quite  leangthy upon these points when He closed He was  followed by Elder W. Woodruff who spoke briefly upon a few item He manifested much pleasure in once  more meeting with the saints said He had been on a mission to the East nearly two years He could not  give so flattering account of matters as Elder Pratt Had for the field in the Eastern States had been like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was  done thare had been Baptized in his field of  labour about 200 since he had been on his mission. As there had been much said about the poor coming to kanesville  Elder Woodruff remarked that He had recieved council from the Presidency in the valley to stretch out his arms and gather all He possibly could to Zion. And when the Lord tells  me to do any thing or I receive council through the proper  sourse I go at it with all my might And I can neither  eat Drink or sleep in peace except the work that is requ- ired of him me to be performed is progressing about right  I have laboured hard to gather out the people according to  the instructions given me. One company started from  Gibson of blank I Also started from St Louis with 225  and we arived here in safety and there are a few poor who  came with me who cannot go through and will stop here and if  in my zeal to carry out the instruction of the Presidency I  have been instrumental in causing more poor saints to come  to Kanesville than ought to have come it has been an  Error of the head and not of the heart. I feel to sustain Elder Hyde in the course He has taken here in taking a stand  against drunkenness gambling stealing Bogasmaking and iniquities  of all kinds. there is order in the kingdom of God. the  Presidency inof the Church are the first to receive and give instruction  to the whole Church and Elder Hyde is the president in this  place and the one to receive and give instructions and He is accountable for his course to the Presidency of the Church, other remarks  were made and was followed by Elder Hyde who said that what  Elder Woodruff had done was all right and would work for good  and other remarks were made He then gave council for the  Brethren who had farms to sell and were thinking of going to the Valley to take this as an omen that it was right for them to  go if they could sell them for what they were worth to sell them and go if not to stay and till them unless they felt disposed to give them to some poor brethren   the conference was dismissed and though there had not been a shower of rain but once since last fall and the bow had  not been seen since last year yet as soon as meeting was  dismissed the clouds gatherd the rain poured down the Bow appeared And it was a matter of observation with  many of the world as well as Saints.

No person who has not  experienced or witnessed one of athose dredful scenes cannot  form any correct idea of them and it is almost impossi- ble to give a correct description of it for to behold 30 or 40  ox teams from 2 to five yoke of oxen in each team attached to a family waggon of goods and women and children all in  an instant like the twinkling of an eye be deprived of  all reason, sens, and government and be filled with madness  frantic and fright and all dart off with lightning speed each  running their own way, roaring bellowing rolling and tumbling  over each other waggons upsetting smashing their  wheels exles and tongues spilling the goods women and child in the street, for the next teams to trample under their feet as they roar and charge on their way with  their yokes bows and chains flying in evry direction is  a scene not easily imagined or described. A stampede of ox teams is much more horrid than horse teams as there  is bits in the horses mouth that he may in a great measure be guided though under full speed, but not so with the  ox. He goes where ever his fancy or will may lead him This stampede in the folling manner commenced. Willford  commenced getting onto his horse and while getting on William Murphy started his horse into a run and the horse flung Wilford over his head onto the ground the saddle turned under his belly and he run and as he approached one of  the waggons Mr Cannons team became frantic and dart  off with great speed and in a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the same example and the whole encampment  apparently was rushing into the jaws of Death. I was by  my carriage when it commenced drawn by a noble fine  black steed Susan Woodruff was in the carriage at the head of the Company. At this moment  I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the midst of the scene whare she was in danger of her life evry instant with many other women and children, I told Rhoda to let the horse run into the bluffs and do the best she could I hit him a blow  to start him into a run and left them to their chance and  the care of providence and rushed into the midst of the  stampede to try to save the life of my wife and as many others as possible but I had hard work to save my  own life Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening and fled  out of the midst of it Brother Pettys two waggons was turned over my family waggon with 4 yoke of oxen ran over one  of his waggons and a waggon run over one of his children Brother Samuel  Hardys children Prescott Hardy was knocked down by his own team and badly wounded in the thigh and arm whareever I    ENDENTRY saw women or children in danger I done what I could to rescue them little can be done at such times ownly for  each one to dodge the best he can and save his own life if possible when I found I could do no more for the encampment in general I run forward to see what state my carriage  and family waggons and family was in I found my noble  horse still a running but on three legs Rhoda was knocked out of the Carriage and Susan was lying flat upon the bottom with her feet hanging out between the wheels  and she was screaming aloud. I hollowed for her to  hold on untill I come she did so untill I caught the horse by the bit and stoped him and rescued her. One of  the ox teams had run onto the horse and carriage had  bent one of the exles smashed one of the horses legs to peaces and knocked Rhoda out of the carriage. As soon as I got the horse out of the carriage I went through  the encampment to see who was dead and maimed  and I was asstonished to find that no one was  killed and but one badly wounded and but little damage  done to waggons or oxen and to look it all over it  looked like a miriacle to see how so many escaped I had to shoot my horse to get him out of his misery  which was painful to me but I was thankful my  wife children and friends were well and their lives preserved    ENDENTRY July 31, 1850 ~ Wednesday   31st Elder L Hardy was vary low to day and I am nearly  worn out with hard labour and care we travled 21 miles  and camped on the bank at the crossing of the south fork  of the Ash Hollow    ENDENTRY August 1, 1850 ~ Thursday   Aug 1st We forded the Platt River with our teams to day It was a hard days work it required 8 or 10 yoke of oxen  to draw a ton across the river it was about half a mile across I got some goods wet.
