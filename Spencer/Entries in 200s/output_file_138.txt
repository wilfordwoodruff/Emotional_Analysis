Elder Hyde Also wished  the sin c grog shops should rest upon the Head of those who kept  such dogeries &amp; the people said Amen to it    in an Edifying manner spoke Also against the Grog shops  Also of his travel in England the progress of the work in that  land the many thousands who were coming into the  church the great increase of the publications the opposition that was begining to be manifest against  them spoke of the signs of the times the building   ENDENTRY  pillar of fire by nigh &amp; a cloud by day resting over the Habitations of the saints Elder Pratt spoke quite  le followed by Elder W. Woodruff who spoke briefly upon a few item He manifested much pleasure in once  more meeting with the saints said He had been on a mission to the East nearly two years He could not  give so flattering account of matters as Elder Pratt Had for the field in the Eastern States had been like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was  done thare had been Baptized in his field of  labour about 200 since he had been on his mission. As there had been much said about the poor coming to kanesville  Elder Woodruff remarked that He had recieved council from the Presidency in the valley to stretch out his arms and gather all He possibly could to Zion. And when the Lord tells  me to do any thing or I receive council through the proper  sourse I go at it with all my might And I can neither  eat Drink or sleep in peace except the work that is requ- ired of  I have laboured hard to gather out the people according to  the instructions given me. One company started from  Gibson of blank I Also started from Boston on the 9 &amp; we arived here in safety &amp; there are a few poor who  came with me who cannot go through &amp; will stop here &amp; if  in my zeal to carry out the instruction of the Presidency I  have been instrumental in causing more poor saints to come  to Kanesville than ought to have come it has been an  Error of the head &amp; not of the heart. I feel to sustain Elder Hyde in the course He has taken here in taking a stand  against drunkenness gambling stealing Bogasmaking &amp; iniquities  of all kinds. there is order in the kingdom of God. the  Presidency  to the whole Church &amp; Elder Hyde is the president in this  place &amp; the one to receive &amp; give instructions &amp; He is accountable for his course to the Presidency of the Church, other remarks  were made &amp; was followed by Elder Hyde who said that what  Elder Woodruff had done was all right &amp; would work for good  &amp; other remarks were made He then gave council for the  Brethren who had farms to sell &amp; were thinking of going to the Valley to take this as an omen that it was right for them to  go if they could sell them for what they were worth to sell them &amp; go if not to stay and till them unless they felt disposed to give them to some poor brethren    a shower of rain but once since last fall &amp; the bow had  not been seen since last year yet as soon as meeting was  dismissed the clouds gatherd the rain poured down the Bow appeared And it was a matter of observation with  many of the world as well as Saints.

No person who has not  experienced or witnessed one of  form any correct idea of them and it is almost impossi- ble to give a correct description of it for to behold 30 or 40  ox teams from 2 to five yoke of oxen in each team attached to a family waggon of goods &amp; women &amp; children all in  an instant like the twinkling of an eye be deprived of  all reason, sens, &amp; government &amp; be filled with madness  frantic &amp; fright &amp; all dart off with lightning speed each  running their own way, roaring bellowing rolling &amp; tumbling  over each other waggons upsetting smashing their  wheels exles &amp; tongues spilling the goods women &amp; child in the street, for the next teams to trample under their feet as they roar &amp; charge on their way with  their yokes bows &amp; chains flying in evry direction is  a scene not easily imagined or described. A stampede of ox teams is much more horrid than horse teams as there  is bits in the horses mouth that he may in a great measure be guided though under full speed, but not so with the  ox. He goes where ever his fancy or will may lead him This stampede in the folling manner commenced. Willford  commenced getting onto his horse &amp; while getting on William Murphy started his horse into a run &amp; the horse flung Wilford over his head onto the ground the saddle turned under his belly &amp; he run and as he approached one of  the waggons Mr Cannons team became frantic &amp; dart  off with great speed &amp; in a moment 20 or 30 teams followed the same example and the whole encampment  apparently was rushing into the jaws of Death. I was by  my carriage when it commenced drawn by a noble fine  black steed Susan Woodruff was in the carriage at the head of the Company. At this moment  I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the midst of the scene whare she was in danger of her life evry instant with many other women &amp; children, I told Rhoda to let the horse run into the bluffs &amp; do the best she could I hit him a blow  to start him into a run &amp; left them to their chance &amp;  the care of providence &amp; rushed into the midst of the  stampede to try to save the life of my wife &amp; as many others as possible but I had hard work to save my  own life Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening &amp; fled  out of the midst of it Brother Pettys two waggons was turned over my family waggon with 4 yoke of oxen ran over one  of his waggons &amp; a waggon run over one of his children Brother Samuel  Hardys children Prescott Hardy was knocked down by his own team &amp; badly wounded in the thigh &amp; arm whareever I    ENDENTRY  to rescue them little can be done at such times ownly for  each one to dodge the best he can &amp; save his own life if possible when I found I could do no more for the encampment in general I run forward to see what state my carriage  &amp; family waggons &amp; family was in I found my noble  horse still a running but on three legs Rhoda was knocked out of the Carriage &amp; Susan was lying flat upon the bottom with her feet hanging out between the wheels  &amp; she was screaming aloud. I hollowed for her to  hold on untill I come she did so untill I caught the horse by the bit &amp; stoped him &amp; rescued her. One of  the ox teams had run onto the horse &amp; carriage had  bent one of the exles smashed one of the horses legs to peaces &amp; knocked Rhoda out of the carriage. As soon as I got the horse out of the carriage I went through  the encampment to see who was dead &amp; maimed  and I was asstonished to find that no one was  killed &amp; but one badly wounded &amp; but little damage  done to waggons or oxen and to look it all over it  looked like a mir I had to shoot my horse to get him out of his misery  which was painful to me but I was thankful my  wife children &amp; friends were well &amp; their lives preserved    ENDENTRY July 31, 1850    worn out with hard labour &amp; care we travled 21 miles  &amp; camped on the bank at the crossing of the south fork  of the Ash Hollow    ENDENTRY August 1, 1850    It was a hard days work it required 8 or 10 yoke of oxen  to draw a ton across the river it was about half a mile across I got some goods wet.    ENDENTRY August 2, 1850    of the  to go the rest of us went out to hunt cattle I found  them in the bluffs in a bason &amp; drove them into  camp the men many of them had gone hunting cattle I yoked the oxen &amp; with the assistance of women &amp; children I drove the encampment on &amp; soon the men returned from hunting oxen they found their encampment gone &amp; followed on &amp; over took us we got along well untill  we came to go down those tremendious bluffs into Bess both smashed each a  hind wheel to peaces &amp; broke evry spoke out I worked untill eleven oclok at night to get the broken waggon  into camp &amp; then left them by the way side &amp; walked  into Ash Hollow &amp; camped for the night wearied out. 20 m    ENDENTRY August 3, 1850        ENDENTRY August 4, 1850     Saints.
