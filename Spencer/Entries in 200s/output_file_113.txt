 W. Woodruff  Spoke of the degeneracy of the inhabitants of the earth, particulary of the United States. Spoke of the present move and argued that great good would result from it, if the saints live up to their privileges.

One particu-larly rises in my mind and that one is the rise, pro-gress and winding up of the Kirtland Bank.  So far as any published information is concerned we have failed to find out much in relation to this subject.In a general way we know it was established and we believe all its l[i]abilities cancelled when it suspended payment.  Perhaps Bro. Reynolds will take the trouble to col-late a few items and send here to enlighten our ignorance.It is customary for the president of the mission to visitthe Swiss & German missions and also the Scandinaviancountry, I believe Bro Teasdale neglected it last year and the brethren who preside wish to know the timewhen I can come to them.  I expect to go soon but would like your sanction to do so.Have rented a small ready furnished house aboutone hour from 42 situated at New Brighton, we all feel that to spend the summer here will be too great a drain on our health.  We shall try and pay for the rent. 
 I am sure you will agree with us in doing what we deem best for the general health.  I was obliged to send Mrs. Y. away she was so much reduced.I understand that a great amount of money has been borrowed in New York by our brethren re-cently.  Now I am quite sure that their securitiesare used to get British gold to meet these loans &those in N. Y. pay about 4% while our brethren pay from 6% 8% 10%  The way might just as well be opened and avoid borrowing of money in this Country.

 DESERET NEWS:WEEKLY.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THEDESERET NEWS COMPANY.CHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.WEDNESDAY,—Oct. 12, 1887.AN EPISTLETo the Members of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.INTRODUCTORY.Dear Brethren and Sisters:It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighthSemi-annual Conference of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,that an Epistle should be addressed tothe members of the Church, in con-forminty with the custom which hasbeen observed at the past five GeneralConferences.DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.As some of the Apostles are pre-vented, by circumstances well knownto the Saints, from appearing in pub-lic, the Church will naturally look for some expression from them concern-ing their feelings and hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at thepresent time is deep interest felt in theutterances of the Apostles, because of the loss which the Church has sus-tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHNTAYLOR. Twice before has the Churchmourned the death of its President,and each time the event has produceda profound impression upon its members. In this instance this sad eventis invested with more significance thanit would have been had it occurred inthe ordinary way. President Taylordied in exile. For about two yearsand a half he had been compelled tolive in seclusion, and to refrain fromall public association with the peoplewhom he loved more than he did life.Through his decease the Church iscalled the third time to mourn the de-parture of the man who has stood asits President and as the Prophet, Seerand Revelator to this generation. The experience which the Saints havegained in passing though these trialshas been of exceeding value to them. They have learned that God can takecare of his own work, and that theyneed not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning its management.After the martyrdom of the ProphetJoseph Smith there were pretenders who as-serted that they had the right to takehis place at the head of the Church.Some were deceived by their preten-sions, not being familiar with the or-der of the Priesthood.THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APOSTLES.For some time before his death theProphet Joseph Smith was inspired of theLord to aniticipate his own departurefrom earthly scenes. This was shownin various ways; bu especially in thegreat anxiety which he displayed tobestow upon the Twelve Apostles allthe keys and authority of the HolyPriesthood which he had received. He declared in private and in public that they were equipped and fully qualified,and that he had rolled the kingdom ofGod on to the shoulders of the Twelve Apostles.PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONAL TESTIMONY.I, Wilford Woodruff, being the lastman living in the flesh who was pres-ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the House of Israel, and to the whole world to bear this my last testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called theTwelve Apostles together in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many days withus in giving us our endowments, andteaching us those glorious principleswhich God had revealed to him. Andupon one occasion he stood upon hisfeet in our midst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great and last dispensation which God had set His hand to perform upon the earth inthese last days. The room was filledas if with consuming fire; the Prophetwas clothed upon with much of thepower of God, and his face shone and was transparently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in time or in eternity, with the followinglanguage:"Brethren, I have had great sorrowof heart for fear that I might be taken from the earth with the keys of the Kingdom of God upon me, withoutsealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed upon my head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing and build-ing up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth, and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I thank God I have lived to see the daythat I have been enabled to give you your endowments, and I have nowsealed upon your heads all the powersof the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest-hoods and Apostleship, with all thekeys and powers thereof, which Godhas sealed upon me; and I now roll offall the labor, burden and care of this Church and Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now commandyou in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, andbear off this Church and Kingdom ofGod before heaven and earth, and be-fore God, angels and men; and if youdon't do it you will be damned."And the same spirit that filled theroom at that time burns in my bosomwhile I record this testimony, and theProphet of God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to stand at the head of the Church and direct itsaffairs.THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.When the Prophet Joseph hadpassed away by foul assassination,those who possessed the Spirit of God and were living in close communion with it, knew the voice of the true shepherd and were not deceived by theclaims of men who pretended to have authority. The body of the Churchfollowed the leadership of those whomGod had chosen, and whom His ser-vant Joseph had been instructed toprepare for this great responsibility.The Twelve Apostles, with President Brigham Young as their head, became the presiding council of the Church.The lessons which the Church thenlearned in regard to the Priesthood, and the rights of the Priesthood, havenever been forgotten. When Presi-dent Young was taken from us, therewas no jar nor division of sentimentamong the Apostles; and among the people there was scarcely a question asto where the right of Presidency rest-ed. President John Taylor took theposition which belonged to him, and the work of God moved forward with-out interruption, and with a union andharmony on the part of all connectedwith it, most delightful to wit-ness. He has stood at our headfor nearly ten years, and during thatperiod he has possessed the gifts andqualifications which belonged to his high office and calling. His entire career is one that can be contemplatedwith the utmost satisfaction and pleas-ure by all who love the truth and ad-mire integrity in those who are calledto be servants of God. From the timethat he was baptized a member of theChurch until his spirit took its flight from earth, he never wavered in his ad-vocacy and defense of the principles ofrighteousness. Under all the varied circumstances through which he andthe people of God were called to pass,in the midst of the deepest trials andafflictions, his voice was always raised in tones of encouragement and hope; and when the storms were the fiercest, he rose to the occasion and alwaysdisplayed undaunted courage and un-flinching devotion to the Zion of God.In the providence of God it fell to his lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and Patriarch Hyrum when they were martyred for the truth, and he mingledhis own blood with theirs. Though severely wounded on that occasion, he miraculously escaped death. He was a man whom the Lord loved. The evidence of this is to be found inthe fact that He [c]hose him to preside over His Church at the departure ofHis servant Brigham. We feel thank-ful to God our Eternal Father that wehave been permitted to live with and enjoy the society of President John Taylor and be his fellow-laborers.Our association with him and the Presidents and Apostles who havegone before him into the spirit world,we esteem as a great honor. We takedelight in anticipating the rejoicing that we shall have when we shall bepermitted to mingle in their society.Once more, the responsibility ofpresiding over the Church has fallen upon the Council of the TwelveApostles. The Counselors of Presi-dent Taylor, Brothers George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles at the time they were chosento be members of the First Presidency, have, since his death, taken their places again as members of that Council.Fifty-seven years and a half have elapsed since the Church was organ-ized. In looking around among thosewith whom we associate to-day, howfew there are left of those who, under the Lord, helped to lay thefoundation of this work and were thecompanions of the Prophet in theearly labors connected therewith! To-day there is but one Apostle left ofthose who belonged to the Council of the Apostles during the lifetime of the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at thetime these valleys were first settled. The other faithful Apostles who wereordained under the direction of theProphet Joseph have all passed behindthe vail. Since the death of PresidentYoung four have joined him in theother world, and in the same periodsix have been ordained as members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.This gives some idea of the changeswhich are occurring, and how rapidlya new generation is taking an active part in the building up of Zion.THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.Those of us who have been at libertyto travel, have devoted our time to visiting the various Stakes, and in meeting with them at their QuarterlyConferences. Some of us have beenlaboring in Mexico, others in Arizona,besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho and in Utah. These Quarterly Con-ferences are attended with excellentresults. The people come together and receive instructions and coun-sel upon leading topics, andmuch good is derived therefrom.Though it involves considerable laborfor the Apostles to visit them, yet weare encouraged in doing so by the ad-vantages which those visits bring to the people in keeping them informedconcerning general movements and counsel. In these labors we have hadmuch joy and satisfaction, especiallyin witnessing the increase of faithful-ness on the part of the Saints.THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.Though many of the leading menhave been compelled to be absent, some of them having been incarcer-ated in prison, the people have, never-theless, been steadfast, and have sought with increased diligence to per-form their duties. The persecution towhich they have been subjected hasled the people to think and act forthemselves, and not depend somuch upon others for guidance. This can not fail to be attended with good results. It is necessary that all the members of the Church should exer-cise their powers of reason and reflec-tion and thoroughly understand whythey take the course which God pointsout. Intelligent obedience on the partof His Saints is desired by our Father in heaven. He has given us our agencyto think and act for ourselves, on our own volition, to obtain a testimony for ourselves from Him concerning the truth of the principleswhich He teaches, and then be firmand unshaken in the performance ofall which is necessary for salvation.We have felt great satisfaction inwitnessing the dignity and courage which the Saints have exhibited through the trials of the past three years. Their conduct has been ad-mirable. They have displayed greatqualities. The forbearance, patience and fortitude which they have ex-hibited are proofs that God has beenwith them. Outrages which would have goaded any other people into acts of violence have been of frequent oc-currence. In other communities men and women would be desperate undersuch treatment. But the Lord has given His people power to control themselves and peace has been main-tained. Riots and bloodshed have been avoided, and even under strong provocation, when blood was shed, thecommunity restrained itself. Preju-dice may prevent our nation and its rulers from acknowledging, at the present, how noble the demeanor ofthe people has been underthese trying circumstances, and with the strong provocations which they have had to indulge inoutbreaks; yet the time will comewhen all this will receive its properrecognition and due credit will be ac-corded the Latter-day Saints for their magnanimity and self-control through-out this entire persecution.PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.In the organizations which have been established among our people in all our settlements in these moun-tains, the advancement and trainingand benefit of all classes are amply provided for. Among no people of whom we know anything have such provisions been made for the salvationand care of the members of society ofall ages as among the Latter-daySaints.  If we and our children do notprogress in intelligence and in the knowledge of all principles pertainingto life here and life hereafter, it is be-cause we do not avail ourselves of those facilities which are placed withinour reach. We have the Primary As-sociations provided for the benefit ofthe young children of our Church, andtheir instruction in those simple prin-ciples which they can understand. Wealso have Sunday schools for thetraining and education of those of larger growth. In them they can learnthe doctrines of salvation and the his-tory of the work of God, and be pre-pared for greater progress. Then we have the Young Mens' and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations, which have been organized, astheir names imply, for the development of the young people of both sexes and their advancement in every thing thatwill qualify them for lives of useful-ness and honor. But besides these or-ganizations we have the various coun-cils of the Priesthood, to some officein which every young man who is worthy can be ordained. The youngwomen, as they increase in years, canalso find a sphere of usefulness in theRelief Societies which have been or-ganized for the purpose of assisting the Bishops and Counselors and Teachers of the Wards in caring for the poor and relieving the wants of the suffering and distressed. So that bymeans of these organizations, whichare of vast interest to us as a people, every one from early childhood to ma-turity, can be led forward step by step,from one degree of knowledge to an-other until fully qualified to dischargeall the duties of perfected and honor-able manhood and womanhood.So far as we know the sisters whohave charge of the Primary Associa-tions are doing a most commendablework in arousing interest in the lit-tle ones and in teaching themin simple style those lessons which are adapted to their under-standings. We hope that in all oursettlements these associations will re-ceive the constant care and attention of our wise and judicious sisters. Theseed sown in the hearts of the childrenby the instructions imparted therewill produce in years to come an abundant harvest that will gladden the hearts of the Saints who witness it.OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.The progress of the Sunday School cause in Zion continues satisfactory, though undoubtedly somewhat re-tarded by the enforced absence fromits labors and associations of so many brethren and sisters who have informer years taken an active interest in its welfare. We notice, with pleas-ure, the constantly increasing number of schools, teachers and scholars re-ported by the officers of the Union and the evident care taken by the presiding local authorities in our settlements tohave a Sunday School as one of thefirst institutions established. Weare also gratified to learn thatin most of the foreign missionsof the Church Sunday Schoolsand Improvement Associations are being organized wherever practicable. In Great Britain, in Con-tinental Europe, in New Zealand, and in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the branches scattered throughout themissions in the United States, theseinstitutions are found contributing their influence in instructing and forming the character of the childrenof the Latter-day Saints.The Mutual Improvement Societiesare also accomplishing great good throughout our settlements. In connec-tion with them and the Sunday Schools,we desire to remind our brethren and sisters who are engaged in the praise-worthy labor of fostering these insti-tutions, that the original design inorganizing Sunday Schools and Im-provement Societies among us was, that the children and youth of the Saints should be made wise in theprinciples of the Gospel and their faithbe developed in the revelations ofGod. This the officers and teachers should keep constantly in mind. Thebooks used should be almost without exception, the revelations of God ascontained in ancient and modernScripture, together with the other works of the Church. The teachings, while direct, brief and simple, shouldbe such as will increase the faith, de-velop the veneration and love, and draw out the intelligence of the youth-ful bearers toward the divine princi-ples of which by God's grace, we have been made the custodians. All at-tempts, however slight, to secularize these institutions and to change themso that they will not accomplish theends sought for in their creation, should be discountenanced. Thespirit and teachings of the Gospelshould hold undivided control in allour ministrations connected with thiscause. In the theological and other classes all discussions should be avoided as much as possible on sub-jects which God in His wisdom has notyet fully revealed. We know there aremany persons who appear to take more delight in dwelling upon questionswhich are mysterious and cannot very well, in our present state of knowl-edge, be answered than they do upon those subjects which are plain andsimple and essential to present pro-gress. But the Lord has revealed so much that we can understand and that we ought to learn in order tobe useful in the labors devolving uponus here, that we need not enter intodiscussion on subjects which in no way affect our happiness here or eter-nal salvation hereafter. In our theo-logical classes, quorum meetings andother assemblies, therefore, these de-batable questions need not be dis-cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the time of the members, to the exclusionof more profitable topics. In the Primary Associations, the Sundayschools and the Mutual Improvement Associations, singing should receive aarge share of attention. Singing ex-ercises can be made a great attraction and also a valuable addition to the ed-ucation of the young. The interest that is now taken among us in vocal and instrumental music is a markedfeature of the times, and this taste finds increasing opportunities for its development in the facilities which arenow being furnished to all who desireits cultivation. Instead of having a select few act as choirs in theseinstitutions to do the singing for thewhole, the voices of all should be united in harmonious melodyin giving utterance to the feelings oftheir hearts in hymns and songs. Thiswill increase the pleasure of the meet-ings, and make all feel that they have an equal interest in worship and re-joicing.THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.The mission of the Relief Societiesas organized among us, is truly grand and beneficent. There is no limit totheir labors and usefulness while suf-fering and want exist in our midst. Toaid the needy by feeding the hungry and clothing the destitute is distinc-tively and peculiarly their mission. Inthe energetic performance of theirduty human sympathy and divinemercy are beautifully harmonized. In extending relief to the poor, the loveof God and of our fellows is clearly manifest. It is more praiseworthy fora relief society to be able to say"There are none in our Ward in needof food, raiment or shelter," than to report thousands of dollars in hand,while the needs of the poor are un-supplied.These societies have done a vast amount of good among us, and themembers have been of great service inassisting the Priesthood in the wards in caring for the destitute and in sup-plying the wants of those who havebeen in need of help. In these laborswe desire to give them every encour-agement and to invoke the blessing of heaven upon them, and all their exer-tions for the benefit of suffering hu-manity.THE CARE OF THE POOR.As the winter season is approaching, it is proper that each Bishop and his Counselors should take the necessarysteps to properly care for the poorwho live in their wards. They shouldcall the Relief Societies to their aid in this labor. The reasonable wants ofthe poor should be supplied and thepangs of poverty and destitutionshould be averted. God has greatly blessed us in the fruits of our fieldsand gardens, in our flocks and herds, and in giving us comfortable habita-tions and means to sustain ourselves,and we should always remember the words of the Apostle James: "Pure religion and undefiled before God andthe Father is this, to visit the father-less and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."While it has always been thepolicy of our people to encourage in-dustry and to repress idleness in every form, and to expect all persons to contribute, according to their ability, to their own support; still there aremany cases where the aged and the in-firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with the utmost exertion and economy, ob-tain through their own labors suffi-cient to sustain themselves. It would be a great evil among us to encourage any class in living upon the benevo-lence of the community. No system of begging should be permitted.Those able to work should be fur-nished employment. Persons who areproperly disposed will be glad to ob-tain it in preference to being fed withthe bread of charity; and all should be encouraged to labor according totheir strength. This policy, if wiselypursued will prevent pauperism, de-velop self-exertion and confidence, andproduce self-respect. It is a causeof great pleasure to think that beg-gary is unknown throughout our set-tlements. There is no need for any-one, however destitute, to publiclysolicit alms. But while this is the case, the sensitive and those who shrink from asking aid, who conceal,in some instances, their poverty, should be carefully looked after by theRelief Societies under the direction ofthe Bishops of the wards, so that there may be no individual in any of ourwards suffering for the want of food orany other article necessary to sustain or preserve life. The community whosehearts are open to the cries of distress, who are ready to administer of thesubstance which the Lord gives them to relieve their fellow creatures, may always depend upon the favor of theLord, for He loves those who are kindto their fellow-men, and who admin-ister to their necessities, whose heartsare tender, and who readily respond toapplications of this character which are made upon them, or who antici-pate them by giving freely to the desti-tute.FAST OFFERINGS.In some of our wards there is notproper care taken in the collection of the fast offerings of the people. Thefirst Thursday in the month has been set apart in the Church as a day offasting and of prayer. That day should be strictly observed. Fast offeringsshould be brought with a liberal handto the Bishop of each ward, that hemay be prepared to supply those who are dependent upon the ward for sus-tenance. Some wards require consid-erable aid from the Church to help sustain their poor, because their ownfast offerings do not supply them;while sometimes in the same Stakethere are other wards where there arefew, if any, dependent poor. Presidents of Stakes should make arrangements with the Bishops of the last named wards to transfer their fast offeringsto the Bishop of some contiguousward which has more poor within itsborders than its own fast offeringswill supply. In this way all the peo-ple can have an equal opportunity ofdoing their duty to the poor.THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.Experience has abundantly proved that those who are attentive to thoseand all other duties required by theLord receive His blessing. God does bless those who devote themselves with singleness of purpose to Hiswork. If proof of this were needed, one has only to notice the condition ofElders in the various settlements whohave spent years of their lives uponmissions. Though their home affairsmay have been left to the care of theirwives and children, they are not dis-tinguished by their poverty from their fellow-servants who have remained at home.We have only to look around us tosatisfy ourselves also, that those whoare generous in contributing to God's work are favored of the Lord. Thiswas the experience of ancient Israel,and it is our experience. Yet in re-gard to voluntary donations there istoo much carelessness, notwithstand-ing all the precious promises con-nected therewith. The Saints should be reminded of the obligation whichrests upon them. Our children, also,should be taught this duty, that it maybecome a fixed habit with them topunctually attend to these matters. Those who have strictly observed these requirements can testify to thegreat pleasure and many rewards theyhave received from their observance.This law of liberality appears to beone of the safeguards which the Lordhas adopted to avert from his peoplethe evil consequences which follow the possession of wealth. He has toldus that the riches of the earth are His to give; but He has warned us to be-ware of pride, lest we become as theNephites of old. We know the ruin itwrought for them, and we should spare no precaution to prevent wealth having a disastrous effect upon us.Many can endure poverty and be hum-ble and live near the Lord who cannotbear riches. They become lifted up in

 Oct. 12 THE DESERET NEWSpride and become covetous, and for-get their God. Those, however, whoremember constantly the teachings of the Lord concerning the earth and itsinhabitants, and who contribute of themeans which the Lord gives them to assist the poor and help carry forward the work of God, exercise a check uponthemselves and give Satan less powerto lead them astray. Under the pres-ent system of affairs, those who ac-cumulate wealth and are able to sup-ply themselves and their families withluxuries and advantages that are de-nied their neighbors, are in danger of becoming separated from the bulk of the people and forming a distinct class. But the day will come when amore perfect order will be introduced.Then it will be said there are no poorand no rich in Zion—that is, we shall not be divided into classes, but shall all possess everything of this charac-ter necessary for our comfort and hap-piness. But until then, if we wish our families and ourselves to remain Lat-ter-day Saints, we must be especiallycareful to guard against the deceitful-ness of riches.THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.The great labor which devolves upon us, as members of the Church, is to build up Zion. God has founded Zion, and we should seek to extend its bene-fits and blessings unto all mankind. Itshould be our constant care to do nothing that will weaken its influenceor power or retard its growth in the earth. This we should constantly im-press also, upon our children, thatthey may grow up filled with an abid-ing love for the work of God.There has been too much neglecton this point. Many have pursued a short-sighted, selfish policy; and haveworked to that which they believed was their own individual advantagewithout regard to the effect their ac-tion would have upon the work of God. Their eyes have not been single to Hisglory. Such a disposition has proveda snare to those who have indulged init; they have wrought injury to them-selves, not to mention the effect their conduct has had upon Zion.THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.The Lord has informed us that mar-riage is ordained of God unto man. The institution of marriage, in somecommunities of which we read, is fall-ing almost into disrepute. It is al-leged that there is a growing tendencyin this direction among us. The causeis doubtless, traceable to the in-crease of wealth and the dis-inclination of young men to take upon them the burdens of a wife andfamily. As we depart from the sim-plicity of early days, we may naturallyexpect that this tendency will increaseas young men may be restrained from offering marriage to young ladies un-less they can give them something like as comfortable a home as they enjoyunder their parents' roof. Extrava-gant or luxuriant habits or training on the part of the girls will also have theeffect to deter young men from marry-ing. Care should be taken by every person of influence to counteract this tendency, and to set before the rising generation the advantages which fol-low well-arranged marriages. Nocommunity can prosper and maintain a high standard of morality wherethere is a large percentage of unmar-ried young men and young women.We should deplore the increase of such a class among us, and all honor-able means should be used to prevent its existence. The young of both sexes should be taught that it is notnecessary to happiness in marriage tobe in the possession of wealth. In this country an industrious, economi-cal married couple can soon surround themselves with all the conveniencesand comforts essential to life and hap-piness. The satisfaction each will have in after years in the enjoyment of the fruits of their joint industry and thrift will amply repay them for any in-conveniences or privations they may have been subjected to in the early days of their married life. The com-forts thus accumulated will be doublysweetened unto them by the recollec-tion of their exertions in common to procure them. No rightly constitutedand educated young woman will refuse an offer of marriage from a worthy, in-dustrious young man for no other rea-son than that he is not able to surroundher at first with the comforts which she may think she ought to have. Young men, who have a due share ofthe qualities which women esteem ina husband, need not be afraid that girlsof that kind will refuse them, becausethey may not be well endowed with this world's goods. They will cheer-fully bear their part of the burdens oflife without repining when confident of the love and supporting and guidinghand of their husbands.AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.We feel led to caution the Latter-day Saints against forming the bad habit of incurring debt and takingupon themselves obligations which fre-quently burden them heavier than theycan bear, and lead to the loss of theirhomes and other possessions. We knowit is the fashion of the age to use credit to the utmost limit, and it is custom-ary for nations, states, counties and cities to borrow money, issue bonds and thus load themselves with taxes to such an extent that large numbersof the people are prevented from own-ing land or even the houses which theyoccupy. Thus the masses become ten-ants and have to pay rent for land and shelter. This is a great evil and onethat we, as a people and as individuals, should carefully shun. Our businessshould be done, as much as possible, on the principle of paying for thatwhich we purchase, and our needsshould be brought within the limit of our resources. The disposition tospeculate and to take chances upon ventures of one kind and anothershould be repressed. There are manypeople who have been rendered home-less in our Territory by the neglect of this precaution. To raise funds to in-vest in some scheme which has ap-peared promising they have mortgaged their homes, only too often, to be dis-appointed and to find themselves with-out a place of shelter for themselves and their families. All this is wrong.If the penalty for such unwisdom fellupon the one through whose acts and influence it is brought about, the con-sequences would not be so deplorable; but very frequently families suffer and the bad results are widely felt. We, therefore, repeat our counsel to the Latter-day Saints, to shun debt. Be content with mod-erate gains, and be not misled by illu-sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re-member the saying of the wise man: "But he that hasteth to get rich shall not be innocent." Let our chil-dren also be taught habits of economy,and not to indulge in tastes which they cannot gratify without running indebt.ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.We have been favored, as no otherpeople have, with wise counsels. Their extent and variety are immeas-urable. They cover every department of human life. So far as we have ob-served them, prosperity and happinesshave been the results. Whateverdifficulties we may have to contend with to-day are due, if not wholly, at least in great part, to our disregard ofthem. Is not this the experience andtestimony of all the faithful Saints who have watched the progress ofevents among us? Had we observedthese counsels, how many of the evilsfrom which we now suffer would never have been known among us! Our neglect of them has brought itspunishment, and the faithful can seeit. But shall we not profit by the ex-perience of the past and act more wise-ly in the future? As the Lord has said(Doctrine and Covenants, sec. ##Doctrine and Covenants 90:36-37|90, ver. 36 37##),"But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with Zion, and pleadwith her strong ones, and chasten her untilshe overcomes and is clean before me: Forshe shall not be removed out of her place, I, the Lord, have spoken it."We should begin to understand that God's ways are infinitely superior toour ways, and that His counsels,though they may seem to call for sacrifice, are always the best and thesafest for us to adopt and carry out.Thousands among us can testify to thetruth of this from individual experi-ence. These thousands should com-bine and create a public opinion in fa-vor of obedience to the counsel of heaven that will have its proper effect upon our children and the inexperi-enced among us.THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.We also should learn this great truth, that God will have all the gloryand honor for the establishment ofHis Church and Kingdom on theearth. Man cannot claim it in this orany other age of the world. Nothingbut the power of God could havebrought forth the fullness of the Gos-pel, organized the Church, gathered His people to Zion in fulfillment ofrevelation and performed the work which has been accomplished. There-fore, as Latter-day Saints, we areobliged to acknowledge the hand ofGod in all the blessings we enjoy.THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.It should be the aim of all the mem-bers of the Church to carry out prac-tically in their lives the principles of the Gospel. In no way can we better convince the world of their truth thanin showing in our acts and dealings with one another and withmankind the elevating effect theyhave upon us. We make high profes-sions, and there should be such a highstandard of purity of life among us asto correspond with these professions. Our children should be impressed withthis, and be taught that the name of Saint is so holy that they only whoare pure in heart can claim it.If our religion does not lead us tolove our God and our fellow man andto deal justly and uprightly with allmen, then our profession of it is vain.The Apostle says:"If a man say, I love God, and hateth hisbrother, he is a liar: for he that loveth nothis brother, whom he hath seen, how can helove God whom he hath not seen?"We can best exemplify our love forour God by living our religion. It is vain to profess a love for God while speaking evil of or doing wrong to His children. The sacred covenants we have made with Him strictly impose upon us the duties we owe to one another; and the great office of religionis to teach us how to perform those duties so as to produce the greatest happiness for ourselves and for our fellow-beings. When the obligations of our religion are observed, no words are spoken or acts are committed thatwould injure a neighbor. If the Lat-ter-day Saints lived as they should do,and as their religion teaches them to do, there would be no feeling in any breast but that of brotherly and sisterly affection and love. Backbiting and evil-speak-ing would have no existence among us; but peace and love and good will would reign in all our hearts and hab-itations and settlements. We would be the happiest people on the face of the earth, and the blessing and peaceof Heaven would rest upon us and upon all that belongs to us.If there be unhappiness and heart-burnings and quarrelings and hatredsamong us, they exist because we do not observe the religion which we pro-fess. They are not its fruits. Wherethese evils exist there is a crying ne-cessity for repentance. If any feel in-jured by the words or acts of theirbrethren and sisters, the Gospel pointsout and furnishes the way by which this injury may be repaired. Insteadof talking about this to others theyshould go to the person or persons who have done the wrong and maketheir feelings known. If satisfactionis then made, that ought to end thematter; but if not, it can be reportedto the proper officers of the Churchfor them to take the necessary steps toterminate the difficulties. In this wayanimosities and disunion can be pre-vented and confidence is maintained.PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen-eral custom to partake of thesacrament once a week. Ifthe teachings of our Lord, in remembrance of whom we observethis sacred ordinance, be regarded, no one who has trespassed can be per-mitted to share in it until he has made reconciliation. It is the express com-mandment of the Lord Jesus that noone shall be permitted to partake ofHis flesh and blood unworthily. Amore perfect system to prevent theexistence of improper feelings and wrongs among brethren and sisterscan not be imagined. If the Saints do their duty, difficulties do not remain unsettled beyond the Lord's day whenthey assemble to eat and drink in re-membrance of Him.TEMPLE WORK.Notwithstanding the difficulties thatthe Saints have had to contend with of late, they have pursued their labors inevery direction with unabated zeal. This is particularly noticable in their attendance at the Temples. The wishto avail themselves of the opportuni-ties for attending to the ordinances forthemselves and their deceased friendshas, if anything, increased, and those employed in these sacred buildingshave their time fully occupied in per-forming their duties there. It is evi-dent that the Latter-day Saints ap-preciate the blessings to be obtained through this Temple work. When we reflect that we have two buildings of this character already completed,furnishing abundant facilities forall who choose to go there to obtain the ordinances of God's house for themselves and forthose in whose salvation they takeso deep an interest, and that we have another Temple at Manti nearing com-pletion, and one in Salt Lake City, which we hope to see finished beforelong, our hearts are filled with glad-ness and we cannot refrain from prais-ing our God for His goodness unto Hispeople in permitting them, notwith-standing the opposition and many dif-ficulties they have had to contend with, to erect such structures and to dedicate them, according to the pat-tern He have given for these sacreduses.No right feeling Latter-day Saint can think upon this subject withoutbeing thrilled with heavenly joy for what God has done for us in our gener-ation, furnishing us, as He has done,with every facility to prepare us, ourposterity and our ancestors for that eternal world which lies beyond thepresent life. The Latter-day Saints are, in truth, a highly favored people,and praise to God should ascend from every heart and habitation in our landfor the great mercy and goodnesswhich He has shown unto us. He hasmade us promises of the most preciouscharacter, and he has fulfilled them upto the present time. We would be themost ungrateful and unworthy peoplethat ever lived if, after receiving such wonderful manifestations of His good-ness, we slackened in our diligence orfailed in our obedience and devotionto Him and His great cause.FOREIGN MISSIONS.The treatment which the Elders havereceived in preaching the Gospelthroughout the Southern States, aswe are informed by President JohnMorgan, has been much better of latethan it has been at some other periods.The Elders are listened to with morepatience and do not meet with so muchof the spirit of mobocracy and un-reasoning hate. Additions are being made to the Church, and those who emigrate from that region have gener-ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo-rado.The Elders in the North Western States under the direction of President W. M. Palmer, pursue their laborswith undiminished zeal and with mod-erate success in bringing people into the Church. These fields of labor have furnished opportunities for num-bers of our young men to gain experi-ence in missionary efforts, and thosewho have this privilege return home,in the most of instances, better quali-fied to assist the local authoritieswhere they reside in the labors of theministry.In Great Britain the Elders meet with considerable opposition in places,principally, however, from apostates.They find that field a much more dif-ficult one than it was in former years. The hearts of the people seem to havebecome hardened, and great indiffer-ence prevails in regard to religion. Still we learn from President GeorgeTeasdale, who presides at the presenttime over the European Mission, thatthe Elders who zealously enter intothe labors of the ministry find abund-ant cause for rejoicing in the success which attends their exertions. Throughout the Swiss and German Mission presided over by Elder Fred-erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina-vian Mission presided over by Elder N. C. Flygare, the Elders are laboringalso with commendable zeal and with gratifying results. An effort is being made at the present time to preach theGoepe[l][Gospel] in Turkey, where Elders JacobSpori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintzehave been, and are laboring, and eventhe land of Palestine has been visited, and in the late company of emigrants which reached this City from Europe, nine persons were gathered who had received the Gospel in thatland, a land hallowed tous as the earthly home of our Redeemer, and the soil of which his sacred feet trod.On the Sandwich Islands the Eldersare laboring faithfully under the direc-tion of President William King, andeverything is being done to improvethe condition of that people and to save them from the destruction whichthreatens the extinction of the race.The plantation at Laie is still main-tained, and the Elders who have la-bored and who are still laboring there enter with spirit into the managementof that property in a way to benefit as much as possible the native Saints. The attention of the Elders there is di-rected at present to the Navigator Islands, where some few years agotwo native Elders from the Sandwich Islands were successful in baptizing alarge number of natives and organizing them into branches. These Islands have not been visited by any of thewhite Elders, but it is probable thatsome of our Elders on the Sandwich Islands may in the near future make avisit there.The letters which we receive from New Zealand where Presi-dent William Paxman presides, continue to bring us gratifying intelli-gence concerning the condition andprogress of the work there. The Elders are very successful among theMaories. Many of the white brethren have succeeded in acquiring the lan-guage of that race, which is cognate to that of the Sandwich Islands, and two ofthem, Elders Ezra T. Richards andSondra Sanders, Jr., are now en-gaged, we are informed, in translating the Book of Mormon into the Maori language. In Australia the Elders are also laboring, but it is a much harderfield than among the natives of NewZealand.HOME MANUFACTURES.Frequent reference has been made inpast teachings and in former Epistles to the subject of home manufactures. It has been, and we feel it still oughtto be, a theme of inexhaustible inter-est to Zion; yet there remains an im-mense amount to be done in develop-ing our resources and furnishing facil-ities for the employment of the people. It is pleasing to note the progress which is being made in some direc-tions. Our woolen manufactures are gaining credit for their excellence in other communities as well as our own.But we export considerable wool evenafter all our factories are well sup-plied. If this could be manufactured at home, it would add greatly to thewealth of our community, not only inthe profits which would accrue from the use of machinery, but in the employ-ment which it would furnish to manyof our citizens. Besides the manufac-ture of woolen cloths, there is con-siderable home-made hosiery of excel-lent quality which is placed on themarket.The range of articles which are manufactured in this Territory isgradually increasing; and from thefeeling which now prevails we judgethat many more branches will soon beadded to those already in operation. The manufacture of soaps of variousgrades has now become a settled and paying business. A fine quality of hatsis also made. Boots and shoes andclothing, glass, white lead, lead-pipe, native paints, brushes,paper, printing type, starch,pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu-factured in the Territory, and many o[f] these articles in sufficient quantities to supply the local demand and to ex-port to some extent. It is an encour-aging feature in the most of these en-terprises that those engaged in them are seeking to enlarge their facilities with the view to increase their produc-tion. We have a large number of children growing up among us who should be furnished with opportuni-ties to acquire skill in mechanism,manufactures, and other pursuitwhich are necessary for the comfort of man.  It is not only incumbent upon parents to seek for avenues of prof-itable employment for their children, but it should be kept in view by theleading men of the Church in all oursettlements. An idle man's brain, it is said, is the devil's workshop, and no community can prosper and main-tain a high standard of morality that does not furnish employment for itsmembers. Far better to work for low wages than not to work at all. Butwith proper care, and by putting inuse the experience that many individ-uals in every settlement possess, there need be no want of remunerative em-ployment for the rising generation,and for others who may come in fromabroad. It may not always be kept in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per-centage of idle persons in a commu-nity is a direct loss to the whole. It is unfortunate, also, for a community, when the young and enterprising are compelledto leave it and go elsewhere to find employment or room for the exerciseof the talent of which they feel them-selves possessed. Settlements that are in this situation will languish andgo to decay, while other that furnish facilities for employment will becomethrifty and prosperous. The combi-nation of capital by means of co-op-eration would, in many instances, en-able settlements to start branches ofmanufacture and conduct them suc-cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how-ever, should not be encouraged, astheir failure destroys confidence andmakes it more difficult to obtain aid for worthy enterprises which might bemade successful. Where co-opera-tion has failed among us, it has not been because the principle is defect-ive, but because of mismanagement, sometimes from ignorance and care-lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from selfishness.Our country abounds in useful ele-ments. We have a fertile soil, when properly cultivated, and an admirableclimate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta-bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can be raised here, and as superior inquality as can be found anywhere on the earth. Care should be taken toraise the very best varieties. Ourhorses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, aswell as our grains, and fruits, andvegetables, should be of the verybest kinds, and no pains should bespared to keep them pure. Our sys-tem of irrigation does not admit of the cultivation of large areas of land. Our farms are moderate in ex-tent. This being the case, they shouldbe cultivated in the most approved style, and the whole business con-nected with a farm should be con-ducted in a manner to bring the best results. As facilities for educationincrease, there undoubtedly will be amarked improvement in the manage-ment of all these branches of busi-ness.PRACTICAL EDUCATION.It is gratifying to notice the interest hat is being taken among us in educa-tion; yet there is great room for im-provement. As the taste for what may be called book-learning increases, manual labor should not be neglected. The education of the mind and theeducation of the body should go handin hand. A skillful brain should bejoined with a skillful hand. Manuallabor should be dignified among usand always be made honorable. The tendency, which is too common inthese days, for young men to get a smattering of education and thenthink themselves unsuited formechanical or other laborious pur-suits is one that should not be allowed to grow among us. Of course it is necessary as society is now organized, that the professions, as they aretermed, should receive attention. Butevery one should make it a matter ofpride to be a producer, and not aconsumer alone. Our children should be taught to sustain themselves by their own industry and skill, and not only to do this, but to help sustainothers, and that to do this by honesttoil is one of the most honorablemeans which God has furnished to his children here on the earth. The sub-ject of the proper education of theyouth of Zion is one of the greatestimportance.President Brigham Young during hislifetime established schools in Provo and Logan, where the principles of theGospel have been taught in connectionwith other branches of education, andmore recently similar schools havebeen commenced, and conducted withmarked success; in Salt Lake, Beaverand Fillmore Cities.The good results arising from teach-ings received in the Provo and LoganAcademies are very apparent andpleasing to all who have the interests of the young at heart, and we regretthat such institutions are so limited innumber.Through the indefatigable labors of Professors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew-art and their associates, these schoolshave done, and are now doing, a great work in educational advancement, by instilling a knowledge of the princi-ples of the Gospel of life and salva-tion into the minds of our children,upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of God must rest in the near future.We trust it will not be long beforeschools of this kind will be established in every city and village where the Latter-day Saints reside. In the meantime, however, the Saints shouldnot fail to avail themselves of the privileges that are now offered them in the Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore, and Salt Lake Academies.THE "CHURCH SUITS."Congress, at its last session as you areaware, passed a law entitled "AnAct to amend an Act entitled an Act to amend Section 5352 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, in refer-ence to bigamy, and for other pur-poses," etc.Under the 15th and 17th sections of this law the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arerespectively declared dissolved, and in this Act it is made the duty of theAttorney General of the United States to cause proceedings to be taken in theSupreme Court of the Territory ofUtah to wind up the affairs of said as-sociations.Pursuant to the duty thus imposedupon the Attorney General, on the 30thday of July, 1887, proceedings were be-gun in said court by the United Statesagainst the Perpetual Emigrating FundCompany and its trustees, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints and its alleged trustees for the(Continued on Page 624.)

 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12(Continued from Page 617.) purpose of disposing of the property ofthe one and winding up the affairs of theother: asking in these suits to escheatto the United States large amounts of property alleged to be held by these two defendants. At the time of thiswriting nothing has been done in thesecases further than to appear and an-swer the complaints. What the result of these cases will be, we, of coursecannot now say. It is proper, how-ever, that we should speak upon this important proceeding and let the Saints know how the cases stand.The Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, as all of you well know,was conceived and organized for but one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of our people in their humble efforts togather with their brethren. It has been for this charitable purpose, the object of the generous bounty of the Latter-day Saints, but at no time inits history has it owned any real es-tate, or any personal property, savesufficient for its absolute needs eachsucceeding year. The Church on theother hand has been the owner of property, the gifts and bequests of an earnest, sincere people, made for thepurpose of aiding in the propagationof the Gospel of our SaviorJesus Christ. The effort now beingmade by our government to dissolveor wind up these associations and escheat their property, is the first of the kind in the history of our people,and is believed to b[e] without histori-cal precedent in this country. Whenwe say we shall watch these cases with deep interest, the Saints will readilybelieve that it is not alone for the property involved in these suits, but also for the principles and rights that are at stake.OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.The intelligence which reaches usfrom our settlements in Arizona is en-couraging; and we note with pleasure that the people of the settlements atSt. Johns and Woodruff have conqueredsome of the difficulties with whichthey had to contend, and which madetheir position very trying. Indeed, the news from all the Stakes there isgratifying.IN IDAHO.In Idaho, though our people pay taxes and support the schools, every-one of our faith is denied the privilegeof acting in the capacity of a schooltrustee or teacher, and no one withour belief can take the test oath that has been prescribed by the Legislature. The situation of the people there is one that excites great sympathy. They are practically denied the rights ofAmerican citizens through the infa-mous test oath law which was enacted by the Legislature. It is very trying to their patience and bears heavily up-on them. But the day must come when they will be relieved from theoperation of this infamous law.IN COLORADO.In San Luis Valley, Colorado, the efforts of our people to open and cul-tivate farms, and to surround them-selves with the necessaries and com-forts of life, are meeting with gratify-ing success. This is the more note-worthy because of the fact that thegreat bulk of settlers there have moved from a warm climate and havenot had experience in battling withthe difficulties that have to be met inthe building up of new settlements inan untried soil and climate. Like theSaints in Wyoming, those who residein Colorado have always received fairtreatment and encouragement andkind consideration from their neigh-bors and the officials of the State.IN MEXICO.Our settlements in Mexico are pro-gressing favorably and are graduallybeing strengthened, both at Diaz andJuarez. At the places named and inthe Sierra Madre Mountains near thelatter, we have nearly one hundred andfifty thousand acres of grazing, timberand agricultural lands.The country is well adapted to stock-raising, as the grasses are of good quality and great variety, while theclimate is uniform, the temperature seldom reaching higher than 80 degreesor lower than an approach to thefreezing point. The facilities formaking comfortable homes there areexcellent, the land, water and timber being good. A fine steam saw, shingleand lath mill, and a planer andmolder, are in operation, affordingbuilding material within easy reach of Juarez.The treatment of our people by thenational and state officials in Mexico and her citizens generally, has beencordial and hospitable. By word andact they have encouraged colonizationin the Republic. The settlements inChihuahua afford abundance of roomfor several hundred families and they could live there in peace, and by ordin-ary habits of industry would soon make themselves prosperous and happy.The Mexican Mission was opened in 1870, and the Church now has quite alarge following of native Saints, mainlylocated in and about the national cap-ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice of Warning, and numerous pamphletshave been published in the Spanish language and are being distributed ac-cording to ancient predictions. Thus the truth is being spread abroad among the seed of Israel through the meansof the record of their fathers, as well as by the preaching of the Elders.THE ALBERTA COLONY.Recent letters from President CharlesO. Card, in charge of our colony in Canada, contain information of a grati-fying nature. The soil upon whichthey are located is said to be very pro-ductive, and the grain and vegetables produced are of excellent quality, andrange for stock is abundant and nutri-tious. The colony is preparing for winter, and the families composing it will soon have their houses completed.They have opened a fine vein of coal within three miles of their settlement, which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.The treatment accorded the Saintsthere, by officials and people, has been considerate and kind, and the pros-pects for improvements and prosperityare good. Brother Card would be glad to have any of the Saints, contemplat-ing a change of location, to join him, in that land, and we will gladly ap-prove efforts in that direction.We may be led, hereafter, to call some of the brethren to go there with their families, to aid him in developing the resources of that goodly land.CONCLUSIONWe cannot refrain from expressingto you our own feelings of thankful-ness that we live in such an age, and that God has bestowed upon us His Holy Priesthood and has permitted usto take part in His great work. We are thankful that we are associated with this people called Latter-day Saints; that we live in a day whenProphets and Apostles have been raised up in the Church of Christ; and thatGod has stretched forth His hand tofulfil His great and marvelous pur-poses which have been predicted bythe mouths of the holy prophets sincethe world began. We testify in the name of our Lord and Master, Jesus,that this is the great work of whichthe prophets have spoken, that God isthe founder of it, and that it will stand forever, and accomplish all that hasbeen predicted concerning it. Zion isestablished and will be redeemed. Andit is our continual desire unto God thatHis people may be faithful in keeping His commandments and doing Hiswill, so that they may be accounted worthy to stand, and their childrenafter them, and inherit the great bless-ings which He has to bestow uponthe faithful. The day is not far dis-tant when our Lord and Savior will berevealed from the heavens, and we should live in constant expectation of this great event, and seek, with all theenergy and power that we can exerciseand obtain, to prepare ourselves, ourhouseholds, and, as far as we have in-fluence, the inhabitants of the earth, for His glorious appearing.Your Brother,WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.
