O. Pratt Preached one hour upon the gifts  and graces the importance of our calling upon God by mighty Prayer and  faith in order that we might rend the veil and obtain those blessings  which the Ancients obtained He made many interesting remarks He  was followed by Loren Farr who gave an exhortation to the people  upon what Brother Pratt had said urged the people to give heed  to the council of the servants of God   ENDENTRY FIGURE I followed Brother Farr the following is a synopsis of the remarks  which I made. Brethren and sisters I count it a privilege to  Join my Brethren in bearing my testimony of the things of God I  have a feelings of solemnity resting upon my mind concerning our duties as a people this feelings is increasing upon me daily  I can bear testimony that what brother Pratt has said is true  The Lord has a meaning in sending the Apostles and Elders into  the vineyard in this Territory to preach to the Saints, and I know  as God lives that the same spirit that rested upon the Ancient  Prophets before some great Event has rested upon the Ancient  Apostles and Elders upon this mission the spirit of God has rested upon them to prophesy and teach great things in the name of the  Lord. I feel that as Prophets, Apostles and Elders we have no  time to sleep, slumber, and rest upon our lees and feel that we  have nothing to do but eat, Drink, dance and be merry for I  know there is a mighty responsibility resting upon us as a  people and we have no time to loose or throw away if we do our duty  to God to the Gentile Nations, to the whole House of Israel, to Zion and  Jerrusalem, and are prepared ourselves for the great and mighty Events  which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning. Look at  the House o David the tribe of Judah alone see the rivers of Blood  which have run from their veins shed by the hands of the gentiles  for the Last 1800 years by the hand of Evry gentile Nation  under heaven their rivers of Blood have quenched the flames  of their burning Temples synagogues and cities their treanches and  Cities have been filled with their mangled bodies left unburied  untill the stench has asscended up towards heaven from Generat- ion to Generation evry Gentile Nation have demanded tribute  taxation of them beyong beyond Endurance and persecuted them unto death  The old Jewish Rabbies and Priest have turned their faces tow- ards Gerrusalem for 1800 years and cryed unto God in great sorrow  and affliction. the God of Abraham has declared that the day  should come when their afflictions should scease and they should  be redeemed deliverd from the Gentile yoke redturn to Jerrusalem  rebuild Jerrusalem and their Temple and have great blessings again  given them by the hand of the God of their Fathers but for all  these blessings He would be inquired of by the House of Israel  to do int for them. The dawning of that day has come, the fulness of the Gentiles is fast coming in, the time has come  for them to begin to go home to Jerrusalem but who is to ask  for this blessing at the hand of God is it required at the hand of the  Jews alone their is a veil ostill over them the kingdom of God  is taken from ^them^ the Priesthood with its keys and powr is not within  their reach by which they can rend the veil of Eternity in  order to obtain thes blessings at the hand of the God of ther fathers they have not a partical of faith in the name or blood of the  son of God but they are doomed to go home and build their  city in unbelief then at whose hands does the God of heaven  require these things. It is at your hands O ye Latter Day  Saints you are of the house of Israel linege of Joseph through the  tribe of Ephraim your fathers have been mixed with the  Gentiles and God has called you out and given unto you the kingdom  with all its powers and Blessings He has given you the Holy Priesthood  and taken the veil from off your eyes and you are the ownly people   ENDENTRY under Heaven who now hold these blessings and know and  see the things of God in the true light. Hence the Lord requires  this people to call upon God day and night for the redemption of  this branch of the House of Israel that his promises may be  fulfilled concerning them. Inasmuch as we cannot do any  thing for the Jews but give them our prayers we should not  with hold that blessing from them. Again let us turn our  thoughts to the Lamanites of who are of the linage of Joseph  who surround us in these mountains and vallies who are also cursed  and cast down below the brute creation there is also a thick dark  veil still hanging over them the God of Joseph has said they  should be redeemed and become a white and Delightsome people here  the Lord requires sumthing els at our hands besides praying we  have manual laborur and work to do we have them to redeem  no body els will attempt it. our duties are great towards  that people. we have carried the Gospel to the Gentiles Nations  and they have rejected it and our own Nation has shed the best blood  that rolls in the veins of men, they have slain the prophets and  saints and driven the whole Church and kingdom of God into  these mountains in the midst of the Lamanites here the ark of  God rests shall we cover it up and let it rest idle I say no  the Lord requires the salvation of this branch of the house of  Israel at our hands. As Prophets, Apostles, Elder and Saints of  God we have no time to loose or sleep upon our oars and wait  for somebody els to perform the work. we have it to do and the time  has come. I know the day is at our door when the worship of  that people will be excepted at the hands of God they will be  visited by the Holy messengers of God who will be coworkers  with us then let us call upon God earnestly in their behalf  and do our duty towards them and they will soon stand in Holy  places and recieve the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood and appreciate  them and do a great work which will be excepted of the Lord thes  things are resting upon my mind with great wait day and  night. If we as a people have fallen asleep it is time we  awoke to our duty or we shall come under condemnation as  a people who bear the Priesthood.   I feel to give Brother Orson  Pratt my heart and hand in Joining him in calling upon God that  we may rend the veil that we may obtain greater Blessings  from God. we must pray earnestly in order to obtain the  Holy spirit. many other remarks were made which are not now  written    FIGURE I wrote a letter this morning to Mrs Woodruff  and to my son Phebe which I sent by  Mr salt Lake City he felt better  this morning and did not take away the funds belonging to the  Legislature as he threatened he would    ENDENTRY December 13, 1855 ~ Thursday   13th I met with the Legislative counsel we adjourned untill monday  to give the committies time to bring in business and the carpenters time  to finish the room    ENDENTRY December 14, 1855 ~ Friday   14th I spent the day reading and writing I attended the meeting during  the evening. The meeting was addressed by Phineas Young who  spoke of the Lamanites said He had distributed the Books of   ENDENTRY mormon to the various Indians Chiefs from the Cherekees  to Florida He gave Ross the Cherikee chief one he made  many remarks upon that subject. He made one Error  in saying that the Indians would not imbrace the work  of God or be gathered by the Gospel untill they had gone  through among the Gentiles and trodden them down as  the Book of mormon declairs. But the book of Morm- on declairs that they shall be gathered   He was followed by Samuel Richards  both spoke much to the Edification of the People    ENDENTRY December 15, 1855 ~ Saturday   15th FIGURE I wrote 7 letters to my family to Mrs Woodruff  to Sarah which  I sent By mail. I spent the afternoon on a committy on Education    ENDENTRY December 16, 1855 ~ Sunday   16th Sunday FIGURE the mail came in to day and brought me  a letter from Mrs P. P. Pratt Preached to  the People in the forenoon upon the practical duties of life but I was at home writing. President Young Preached in  the afternoon and I reported his sermon the following is  a synopsis of the same   President Youngs text was Arise and shine O Zion for ^thy light is come^  and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. He said I have  always felt since I have been called to preach to speak of the  practical things of evry day life instead of some great misteries  a long way ahead in tEtearnity which the people do not know nor  never will as the thing tought does not exhist I felt in the  begining of my being called to the ministry that I had no right  to preach except I was filled with the spirit of Revelation  and prophesy as the Ancients and I feel the same to day in order  to be qualified to preached we should be filled with Reve- lation I do not consider that any man is qualified to preach the  Gospel and the sayings of the prophets unless he is filled with the  spirits of the prophets. We are commanded to arise and shine  but for us to sit down and say that we believe in this work  we believe that ^Joseph^ was a Prophet, and still not carry out the work which we are commanded to do, not to build up or  beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss of our aim  we shall not enter into the Celestial kingdom we shall not  enter through the gates. We must show to the Lord that  we are willing to fulfill What he requires of us and  this we shall not do unless we are willing to arise and shine,  but how are we to do it, we have got to build up Zion, and  we have got to make Zion the most holy and polished, Refined  and beautiful place upon the face of the whole Earth. So we may expect to see Zion in all that beauty majesty and glory which  God has spoken of. But the people do not understand the  things of God. I will prophesy that unless this people  will rise up and build up Zion as God has commanded  them they will be removed out of their place and another  people will be raised in their stead who will perform the work  and this I say in the name of God. I also say in the name of the Lord  that the desendants of Ephraim who are among the Gentiles   ENDENTRY are the first born and they are the first ones to receive the fulness of the Gentiles gospel in this dispensation they are the first to be gathered together and this work was not to be given to any other in the begining of this kingdom, this has been done. the Ephraimites are before me here to day. Now if I was to  ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would  say yes. But let me tell you ther is not one of you that are willing to do as you are told. I have given the people council for years past how to build their forts, walls, Cities  Houses, and how to begin to beautify and adorn Zion but have  the people done as I have told them in these things, no. You  may say these are of miner consequences. But let me tel you that if you are not willing to do the small things that is necessary ^on earth^ then you are not willing to do as you are told  in heaven. and you will loose your glory and exhaltation Now do you not remember that I told you years ago to go to and build up a beautiful city in this place but there has been  nothing done towards it. we have many that have been in  the Church for quite a number of years and yet we have not a Builder or Architect that knows enough to build  the meanest house of any kind not even a kitchen in the New Jerrusalem. Then how can we build up the  New Jerrusalem? I have told the people all the day long to be prepared to build up this city. And I will say that if we could take all the knowledge that exhists among evry  nation upon the face of the whole Earth and boil it down into  an essenc and put it all into one man He would not know enough to lay the first stone in the wall around the New Jerrusalem to say nothing about building the city and Temple we have got to improve continually and build up good cities and adorn and beautify Zion and let me tel you that  if you do not come to thisat place ^whare^ you will not stand set your heart on any riches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of God, and if this people do not build up Zion they will be moved out of their place. evry time we  build a House or city we should better it, evry thing around us should be neat and clean. now look at this building for a school house. the ground around this building should be  prepared for a play ground, and kept neat and Clean and prepared  so as to make the child Happy. Children should be in a clean  plase but how is it here. the moment the children step out of door they see nothing but filth all the day long. the  minds of our children while young are pure and they should  not spend their time in filthy places for it affects their  minds and feelings they should be in a clean place, for they are visited by the Angels of God but parents do not realize this although it is true. You may say I do not have  time to keep my dwellings, school Houses, door yards andc clean, no nor you never will have till you die upon the same  principle, but you should take time. now it should not take a week till I would clean out my door Yard. But  the people in this Territory have not had time to clean out their door yards, or to make any thing els they ought to do. I will show you that I will set an example for   ENDENTRY my children to follow, I will teach those things which we ought to do to day. I have preached this doctrin from the begining the first time I ever preached was to tell the people the duties of to day. now if you had all the gold in the world what would you do would you go to calafornia No but go to and build up Zion. You may say their is no calafornia  here we have no gold, but it is not gold that is going to build up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but we have  it to do with our hands.  You can make a begining and do sumthing, you can set an example, you can clean out your  house and yard and make that clean, and you can stop the Bed bugs from runing around you. I do not see the first  fruit or shade tree in this Salt Lake  City and get some Fruit trees and set out and have some fruit growing. Now this is Zion and the light has come, and shines upon you and you are call upon to build up Zion. How by going to Calafornia No, for there is millions of Gold here and the Lord will send it in sight when He thinks it is best ^for us to Have it^ as He did in Calafornia. If you think it is not best to come here go back to Harris said that He would stay at Kanesville so when the church got ready to go back to Jackson County He would have but a short way to go what the people here wood, brother G. A. Smith told him He might  Happen to find it much the nearest way there by the  way of the Rocky moutains and many will find that to be the case the longest way around will be the shortest way  there. we have been called great speculators and misers I have told the people I was the greatest miser and speculator in the world, for I am laying plans to try to obtain evry thing there is on Earth and in heaven that is good that is what I am after all the time. I have told the world that I  would possess Heven while they would become servents toin the next world. my speculations are not confined to this world alone Now I say go to and make a fine house in this place. You may say I have not the capitol. vary well look at the salt Lake City we have built up that city without capitol that was built up with the strength of our hands which is our capitol Now I want to say to the people here what do you say to going out on to your lots to build to build your houses and  set out Fruits trees. Your wall around this fort is  not much protection you might as well stick up a row of willows to scare and stop the Indians as any thing there is here. Now go to and build up some good Houses in this place I want to Join some 16 of the Brethren to come here  and build up some houses and a wall around it. but I shall build humble here, I shall not build large, but I want you to lanch outh and then come and see Salt Lake City and If I have not  beat you I will try again. I am determined to improve in all the buildings I do while I live.  If we get our temple built I  mean to go to work and build another one as much better than the one we are now building as this is better than the one that we built in kirtland and this wing of the state House which we have built here is a better building in its finish and structure than that temple was. Now go to and do what God requires of you. and what ever you want to get get lawfully   ENDENTRY and then it will be a blessing to you allways and you will enjoy  it. But steal it and it will be a curse to you and cause you sorrow and misery. Whenever I get so that I set my heart upon Houses, lands, Gold or any thing Els on earth  so as to begin to turn my heart away from the Lord The  Just want to die before that comes to pass day before that  comes to pass I want the Lord to take me away. May God Bless you Amen   President Heber C Kimball followed and said I felt quite well  in the forenoon but I do not feel well this afternoon in health I know what President Young has said is true we have come here and we have Dedicated this people and this place to God. Now do the people realize why we are here no they do  not. we are here for the benefit of all Israel we have not come here for a salary we have come here to do the will  of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our neck and it shall never be put on again not on the necks of this people. for if we do not do as God wants us to do he will raise  up a people that will do it. I tell you that God will smite any people that undertake to stop this work. And I say that  what President Young has said is true you know that what President Young has our children have to learn  the Alphabet first. So it is with this people the things which God teaches us are small and simple in many respects but they are just as necessary for us to learn and practice ias it is for the child to learn his letters in order to understand the Arts and sciences for we have to learn and practice small  things before we can obtain and carry out the greater things of God. Now we are required to begin to build up and  adorn Zion we should set out fruit and shade trees I have  not done as much as I would liked to have done, but I have raised some 15 bushels of peaches. President Young has  a large orchard he has raised a good many peaches and apples and some 10000 1000 lbs of Good grapes as good as I ever tasted. And that is as hard a place to live as there is in these mountains. My wood for one fire cost me some $175. These canyons are full of Good fruit which you can get and set out. I have several kinds of good currants which I got from the canyons which bear large and fine fruit these things all help adorn the Earth, now go to and build up this place and make a beautiful city. you have a good place around the state house for a city and gardens and orchards the soil is sandy and you have a plenty of manure to make it rich.   The people must learn and practice clean- liness in this life some people think they can live all their days in filth and dirt never even wash their bodies then die and go to heaven and be clean but if you do not learn and practice this lesson in this life you will have to learn and practice it in the next before you will be received into the society of those who are clean pure and holy. you have got to be passive in the hands of God. As the prophet has said if we are ^not^ passive in the hands of God as Clay is in the hands of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whall and flung into the batch and ground over again before we   ENDENTRY we can be made vessels of honour what can we be made vessels of honour after we have moved in the hands of the potter  and ground over again yes this will be the case with man but  it is far better to be passive in the hands of God and be made a vessel of honor the first time than to wait thill till we  have to be ground over again this is a figure which the prophet Jeremiahah made use of. Now President Young is the Master Potter here on Earth and we should be subject to him  in all things we should all remember that we have got to render  up our stewardship to God therefore we should be faithful in  all things. And I pray that the spirit of God may rest  upon you that you may do right and be saved with a full  salvation.

He said in 1829 He had this voice continually ringing in his ears "Prepare ye the way of the Lord and make his paths strait." After he was baptized he went to Kirtland and told Joseph that He knew he was a Prophit of God and wanted  him to inquire of the Lord for him when he obtained the revelation recorded in the Doctrins and Covenants given Nov 1830 recorded on Page 280 there the Lord told him to lift up his  voice long and Loud preparing the way for the second coming of the Lord then I understood my former feelings.  I attended the meeting in the evening Br Ray spoke 1st Phineas Young attempted  to speak to the people but vary soon choaked down with coughing  or sumthing in the throat and stoped. Erastus Snow followed and spoke at Length in a vary interesting manner upon a great variety of subjects much to the Edifycation of those who herd. Before the close of the meeting I spoke to the people a few moments the following are some of the remarks which I made   Brethren and sisters I feel to say a few words before closing I have listened with attention to the teachings we have herd during this afternoon and evening and I can bear testimony that they  are true. Elder Orson Pratt has spread before us this after- noon the fulfillment of that grait chain of Prophesyies which are to take place before the coming of the Mesiah like a great panarama spread upon the wall so that evry person can see and behold it. Now can we realize that these great and glorious events  are to transpire within 40 years even in our day and the days of our children, no we cannot but yet it will be so. The President  has said that it was necessary to send missionaries through this Territory to preach to the people in order to save them this I believe is true we as a people have got to rise up and  become sanctifyed pure and holy in order to be prepared to meet the great events which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning we have got to make up our minds whether we will keep a Celestial Law or what Law we will keep.

I attended the Prayer circle whare I herd  some interesting teaching from President Young in social  conversation which was not reported. the following is a key  to some of the principles He advanced. He refered to the preach- ing of Orson Hyde the sabbath before upon the subj- ect of the resurrection. He said the Identical particles of matter  in which we had honored our spirits with ie our tabernacles in which we had suffered, travelled, laboured, and built up the kingdom  of God that would be the Identical body and no other that would be  raised from the grave to immortality and Eternal life. Adam and Eve  had lived upon another Earth were immortal when they came here  Adam assisted in forming this Earth and agreed to fall when He  came Here and He fell that man might be and the opposite principle  to good the devel, the serpent, the Evil was plased upon the Earth that  man might know the good from the Evil for without an Experience  in these things man could not know the one from the other as soon  as the devil was on Earth He sowed the seeds of Death in evry thing  so as soon as they began to eat of the fruit of the Earth they received  into their system the seeds of mortality and of Death so their children  wer mortal and subject to death sorrow pain and wo then when they  partook of life, Joy, ease, and Happiness they would know how to prize it  Father Adam would never scease his labours to redeem his posterity  and exhalt them to all the glory they were capable of receiving He did  not doubt but that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many  of his posterity would receive a Celestial glory and who they were and also a Terrestrial and a Telestial yet man had his agency to act  chuse and refuse good or evil as seemed him good and he would be rew- arded according to his works. O. Pratt asks will Adam or any God con- tinue to make worlds people them taste of Death to redeem them   ENDENTRY Answer I have no doubt but ^it^ is his privilege but whether that He  will do it is a question in my mind.
