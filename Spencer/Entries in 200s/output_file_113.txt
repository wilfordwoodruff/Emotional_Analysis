O. Pratt Preached one hour upon the gifts  &amp; graces the importance of our calling upon God by mighty Prayer &amp;  faith in order that we might rend the veil and obtain those blessings  which the Ancients obtained He made many interesting remarks He  was followed by Loren Farr who gave an exhortation to the people  upon what Brother Pratt had said urged the people to give heed  to the council of the servants of God   ENDENTRY  which I made. Brethren &amp; sisters I count it a privilege to  Join my Brethren in bearing my testimony of the things of God I  have a feelings of solemnity resting upon my mind concerning our duties as a people this feelings is increasing upon me daily  I can bear testimony that what brother Pratt has said is true  The Lord has a meaning in sending the Apostles &amp; Elders into  the vineyard in this Territory to preach to the Saints, and I know  as God lives that the same spirit that rested upon the Ancient  Prophets before some great Event has rested upon the  Apostles &amp; Elders upon this mission the spirit of God has rested upon them to prophesy &amp; teach great things in the name of the  Lord. I feel that as Prophets, Apostles &amp; Elders we have no  time to sleep, slumber, &amp; rest upon our lees &amp; feel that we  have nothing to do but eat, Drink, dance &amp; be merry for I  know there is a mighty responsibility resting upon us as a  people &amp; we have no time to loose or throw away if we do our duty  to God to the Gentile Nations, to the whole House of Israel, to Zion &amp;  Jerrusalem, &amp; are prepared ourselves for the great &amp; mighty Events  which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning. Look at  the House o David the tribe of Judah alone see the rivers of Blood  which have run from their veins shed by the hands of the gentiles  for the Last 1800 years by the hand of Evry gentile Nation  under heaven their rivers of Blood have quenched the flames  of their burning Temples synagogues &amp; cities their treanches &amp;  Cities have been filled with their mangled bodies left unburied  untill the stench has asscended up towards heaven from Generat- ion to Generation evry Gentile Nation have demanded tribute  taxation of them beyong beyond Endurance &amp; persecuted them unto death  The old Jewish Rabbies &amp; Priest have turned their faces tow- ards Gerrusalem for 1800 years &amp; cryed unto God in great sorrow  &amp; affliction. the God of Abraham has declared that the day  should come when their afflictions should scease &amp; they should  be redeemed deliverd from the Gentile yoke re rebuild Jerrusalem &amp; their Temple &amp; have great blessings again  given them by the hand of the God of their Fathers but for all  these blessings He would be inquired of by the House of Israel  to do i fulness of the Gentiles is fast coming in, the time has come  for them to begin to go home to Jerrusalem but who is to ask  for this blessing at the hand of God is it required at the hand of the  Jews alone their is a veil  is taken from ^them^ the Priesthood with its keys &amp; powr is not within  their reach by which they can rend the veil of Eternity in  order to obtain thes blessings at the hand of the God of ther fathers they have not a partical of faith in the name or blood of the  son of God but they are doomed to go home &amp; build their  city in unbelief then at whose hands does the God of heaven  require these things. It is at your hands O ye Latter Day  Saints you are of the house of Israel linege of Joseph through the  tribe of Ephraim your fathers have been mixed with the  Gentiles &amp; God has called you out &amp; given unto you the kingdom  with all its powers &amp; Blessings He has given you the Holy Priesthood  &amp; taken the veil from off your eyes &amp; you are the ownly people   ENDENTRY  see the things of God in the true light. Hence the Lord requires  this people to call upon God day &amp; night for the redemption of  this branch of the House of Israel that his promises may be  fulfilled concerning them. Inasmuch as we cannot do any  thing for the Jews but give them our prayers we should not  with hold that blessing from them. Again let us turn our  thoughts to the Lamanites  who surround us in these mountains &amp; vallies who are also cursed  &amp; cast down below the brute creation there is also a thick dark  veil still hanging over them the God of Joseph has said they  should be redeemed &amp; become a white &amp; Delightsome people here  the Lord requires sumthing els at our hands besides praying we  have manual labo no body els will attempt it. our duties are great towards  that people. we have carried the Gospel to the Gentiles Nations  &amp; they have rejected it &amp; our own Nation has shed the best blood  that rolls in the veins of men, they have slain the prophets &amp;  saints &amp; driven the whole Church &amp; kingdom of God into  these mountains in the midst of the Lamanites here the ark of  God rests shall we cover it up &amp; let it rest idle I say no  the Lord requires the salvation of this branch of the house of  Israel at our hands. As Prophets, Apostles, Elder &amp; Saints of  God we have no time to loose or sleep upon our oars &amp; wait  for somebody els to perform the work. we have it to do &amp; the time  has come. I know the day is at our door when the worship of  that people will be excepted at the hands of God they will be  visited by the Holy messengers of God who will be coworkers  with us then let us call upon God earnestly in their behalf  &amp; do our duty towards them &amp; they will soon stand in Holy  places &amp; recieve the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood &amp; appreciate  them &amp; do a great work which will be excepted of the Lord thes  things are resting upon my mind with great wait day &amp;  night. If we as a people have fallen asleep it is time we  awoke to our duty or we shall come under condemnation as  a people who bear the Priesthood.    Pratt my heart &amp; hand in Joining him in calling upon God that  we may rend the veil that we may obtain greater Blessings  from God. we must pray earnestly in order to obtain the  Holy spirit. many other remarks were made which are not now  written     &amp; to my son Phebe which I sent by  Mr salt Lake City he felt better  this morning &amp; did not take away the funds belonging to the  Legislature as he threatened he would    ENDENTRY December 13, 1855 ~ Thursday    to give the committies time to bring in business &amp; the carpenters time  to finish the room    ENDENTRY December 14, 1855 ~ Friday    the evening. The meeting was addressed by Phineas Young who  spoke of the Lamanites said He had distributed the Books of   ENDENTRY  to Florida He gave Ross the Cherikee chief one he made  many remarks upon that subject. He made one Error  in saying that the Indians would not imbrace the work  of God or be gathered by the Gospel untill they had gone  through among the Gentiles &amp; trodden them down as  the Book of mormon declairs. But the book of Morm- on declairs that they shall be gathered    both spoke much to the Edification of the People    ENDENTRY December 15, 1855 ~ Saturday    to Sarah which  I sent By mail. I spent the afternoon on a committy on Education    ENDENTRY December 16, 1855 ~ Sunday    a letter from Mrs P. P. Pratt Preached to  the People in the forenoon upon the practical duties of life but I was at home writing. President Young Preached in  the afternoon &amp; I reported his sermon the following is  a synopsis of the same    &amp; the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. He said I have  always felt since I have been called to preach to speak of the  practical things of evry day life instead of some great misteries  a long way ahead in  never will as the thing tought does not exhist I felt in the  begining of my being called to the ministry that I had no right  to preach except I was filled with the spirit of Revelation  &amp; prophesy as the Ancients &amp; I feel the same to day in order  to be qualified to preache lation I do not consider that any man is qualified to preach the  Gospel &amp; the sayings of the prophets unless he is filled with the  spirits of the prophets. We are commanded to arise &amp; shine  but for us to sit down &amp; say that we believe in this work  we believe that ^Joseph^ was a Prophet, and still not carry out the work which we are commanded to do, not to build up or  beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss of our aim  we shall not enter into the Celestial kingdom we shall not  enter through the gates. We must show to the Lord that  we are willing to fulfill What he requires of us and  this we shall not do unless we are willing to arise &amp; shine,  but how are we to do it, we have got to build up Zion, and  we have got to make Zion the most holy and polished, Refined  &amp; beautiful place upon the face of the whole Earth. So we may expect to see Zion in all that beauty majesty &amp; glory which  God has spoken of. But the people do not understand the  things of God. I will prophesy that unless this people  will rise up &amp; build up Zion as God has commanded  them they will be removed out of their place &amp; another  people will be raised in their stead who will perform the work  &amp; this I say in the name of God. I also say in the name of the Lord  that the desendants of Ephraim who are among the Gentiles   ENDENTRY  fulness of the  to be gathered together and this work was not to be given to any other in the begining of this kingdom, this has been done. the Ephraimites are before me here to day. Now if I was to  ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would  say yes. But let me tell you ther is not one of you that are willing to do as you are told. I have given the people council for years past how to build their forts, walls, Cities  Houses, &amp; how to begin to beautify &amp; adorn Zion but have  the people done as I have told them in these things, no. You  may say these are of miner consequences. But let me tel you that if you are not willing to do the small things that is necessary ^on earth^ then you are not willing to do as you are told  in heaven. &amp; you will loose your glory and exhaltation Now do you not remember that I told you years ago to go to &amp; build up a beautiful city in this place but there has been  nothing done towards it. we have many that have been in  the Church for quite a number of years &amp; yet we have not a Builder or Architect that knows enough to build  the meanest house of any kind not even a kitchen in the New Jerrusalem. Then how can we build up the  New Jerrusalem? I have told the people all the day long to be prepared to build up this city. And I will say that if we could take all the knowledge that exhists among evry  nation upon the face of the whole Earth &amp; boil it down into  an essenc &amp; put it all into one man He would not know enough to lay the first stone in the wall around the New Jerrusalem to say nothing about building the city &amp; Temple we have got to improve continually and build up good cities &amp; adorn &amp; beautify Zion and let me tel you that  if you do not come to th your heart on any riches or gold you are not worthy to do the work of God, and if this people do not build up Zion they will be moved out of their place. evry time we  build a House or city we should better it, evry thing around us should be neat &amp; clean. now look at this building for a school house. the ground around this building should be  prepared for a play ground, &amp; kept neat &amp; Clean &amp; prepared  so as to make the child Happy. Children should be in a clean  plase but how is it here. the moment the children step out of door they see nothing but filth all the day long. the  minds of our children while young are pure &amp; they should  not spend their time in filthy places for it affects their  minds &amp; feelings they should be in a clean place, for they are visited by the Angels of God but parents do not realize this although it is true. You may say I do not have  time to keep my dwellings, school Houses, door yards &amp;c clean, no nor you never will have till you die upon the same  principle, but you should take time. now it should not take a week till I would clean out my door Yard. But  the people in this Territory have not had time to clean out their door yards, or to make any thing els they ought to do. I will show you that I will set an example for   ENDENTRY  ought to do to day. I have preached this doctrin from the begining the first time I ever preached was to tell the people the duties of to day. now if you had all the gold in the world what would you do would you go to calafornia No but go to &amp; build up Zion. You may say their is no calafornia  here we have no gold, but it is not gold that is going to build up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but we have  it to do with our hands.  You can make a begining &amp; do sumthing, you can set an example, you can clean out your  house &amp; yard &amp; make that clean, &amp; you can stop the Bed bugs from runing around you. I do not see the first  fruit or shade tree in this Salt Lake  City &amp; get some Fruit trees &amp; set out &amp; have some fruit growing. Now this is Zion and the light has come, &amp; shines upon you &amp; you are call upon to build up Zion. How by going to Calafornia No, for there is millions of Gold here &amp; the Lord will send it in sight when He thinks it is best ^for us to Have it^ as He did in Calafornia. If you think it is not best to come here go back to Harris said that He would stay at Kanesville so when the church got ready to go back to Jackson County He would have but a short way to go  the people here wood, brother G. A. Smith told him He might  Happen to find it much the nearest way there by the  way of the Rocky moutains &amp; many will find that to be the case the longest way around will be the shortest way  there. we have been called great speculators &amp; misers I have told the people I was the greatest miser &amp; speculator in the world, for I am laying plans to try to obtain evry thing there is on Earth &amp; in heaven that is good that is what I am after all the time. I have told the world that I  would possess Heven while they would become servents  next world. my speculations are not confined to this world alone Now I say go to &amp; make a fine house in this place. You may say I have not the capitol. vary well look at the salt Lake City we have built up that city without capitol that was built up with the strength of our hands which is our capitol Now I want to say to the people here what do you say to going out on to your lots to build  set out Fruit not much protection you might as well stick up a row of willows to scare &amp; stop the Indians as any thing there is here. Now go to &amp; build up some good Houses in this place I want to Join some 16 of the Brethren to come here  &amp; build up some houses &amp; a wall around it. but I shall build humble here, I shall not build large, but I want you to lanch out beat you I will try again. I am determined to improve in all the buildings I do while I live.  If we get our temple built I  mean to go to work &amp; build another one as  the one we are now building as this is better than the one that we built in kirtland and this wing of the state House which we have built here is a better building in its finish &amp; structure than that temple was. Now go to &amp; do what God requires of you. and what ever you want to get get lawfully   ENDENTRY  it. But steal it &amp; it will be a curse to you &amp; cause you sorrow &amp; misery. Whenever I get so that I set my heart upon Houses, lands, Gold or any thing Els on earth  so as to begin to turn my heart away from the Lord The   comes to pass I want the Lord to take me away. May God Bless you Amen    in the forenoon but I do not feel well this afternoon in health I know what President Young has said is true we have come here &amp; we have Dedicated this people &amp; this place to God. Now do the people realize why we are here no they do  not. we are here for the benefit of all Israel we have not come here for a salary we have come here to do the will  of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our neck &amp; it shall never be put on again not on the necks of this people. for if we do not do as God wants us to do he will raise  up a people that will do it. I tell you that God will smite any people that undertake to stop this work. And I say that  what President Young has said is true you know that  the Alphabet first. So it is with this people the things which God teaches us are small &amp; simple in many respects but they are just as necessary for us to learn &amp; practice  is for the child to learn his letters in order to understand the Arts &amp; sciences for we have to learn &amp; practice small  things before we can obtain &amp; carry out the greater things of God. Now we are required to begin to build up &amp;  adorn Zion we should set out fruit &amp; shade trees I have  not done as much as I would liked to have done, but I have raised some 15 bushels of peaches. President Young has  a large orchard he has raised a good many peaches &amp; apples &amp; some  tasted. And that is as hard a place to live as there is in these mountains. My wood for one fire cost me some $175. These canyons are full of Good fruit which you can get &amp; set out. I have several kinds of good currants which I got from the canyons which bear large &amp; fine fruit these things all help adorn the Earth, now go to &amp; build up this place &amp; make a beautiful city. you have a good place around the state house for a city &amp; gardens &amp; orchards the soil is sandy &amp; you have a plenty of manure to make it rich.    liness in this life some people think they can live all their days in filth &amp; dirt never even wash their bodies then die &amp; go to heaven &amp; be clean but if you do not learn &amp; practice this lesson in this life you will have to learn &amp; practice it in the next before you will be received into the society of those who are clean pure &amp; holy. you have got to be passive in the hands of God. As the prophet has said if we are ^not^ passive in the hands of God as Clay is in the hands of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whall &amp; flung into the batch &amp; ground over again before we   ENDENTRY  of honour after we have moved in the hands of the potter  &amp; ground over again yes this will be the case with man but  it is far better to be passive in the hands of God &amp; be made a vessel of honor the first time than to wait  have to be ground over again this is a figure which the prophet Jeremiah the Master Potter here on Earth &amp; we should be subject to him  in all things we should all remember that we have got to render  up our stewardship to God therefore we should be faithful in  all things. And I pray that the spirit of God may rest  upon you that you may do right &amp; be saved with a full  salvation. And I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ Amen    ENDENTRY December 17, 1855 ~ Monday    after noon in Joint session    ENDENTRY December 18, 1855 ~ Tuesday    in Joint session    Pugh viz to Mrs Bulah Emma    ENDENTRY December 19, 1855 ~ Wednesday    in debating the subject of the Education of our children    ENDENTRY December 20, 1855 ~ Thursday    the council attending to the legislative business    ENDENTRY December 21, 1855 ~ Friday    census agent.

He said in 1829 He had this voice continually ringing in his ears "Prepare ye the way of the Lord &amp; make his paths strait." After he was baptized he went to Kirtland &amp; told Joseph that He knew he was a Prophit of God &amp; wanted  him to inquire of the Lord for him when he obtained the revelation recorded in the Doctrins &amp; Covenants given Nov 1830 recorded on Page 280 there the Lord told him to lift up his  voice long &amp; Loud preparing the way for the second coming of the Lord then I understood my former feelings.  I attended the meeting in the evening Br Ray spoke 1 to speak to the people but vary soon choaked down with coughing  or sumthing in the throat &amp; stoped. Erastus Snow followed &amp; spoke at Length in a vary interesting manner upon a great variety of subjects much to the Edifycation of those who herd. Before the close of the meeting I spoke to the people a few moments the following are some of the remarks which I made    listened with attention to the teachings we have herd during this afternoon &amp; evening &amp; I can bear testimony that they  are true. Elder Orson Pratt has spread before us this after- noon the fulfillment of that grait chain of Prophes are to take place before the coming of the Mesiah like a great panarama spread upon the wall so that evry person can see &amp; behold it. Now can we realize that these great &amp; glorious events  are to transpire within  our children, no we cannot but yet it will be so. The President  has said that it was necessary to send missionaries through this Territory to preach to the people in order to save them this I believe is true we as a people have got to rise up &amp;  become sanctifyed pure &amp; holy in order to be prepared to meet the great events which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning we have got to make up our minds whether we will keep a Celestial Law or what Law we will keep. It is necessary for us to send messengers of salvation to stir up the minds of the people as long as there can be found an Adulterer   ENDENTRY     ENDENTRY March 23, 1855       ENDENTRY March 24, 1855    society in the evening we had a full house &amp; an interesting address  from David Cantling upon the history of the Russians the Russian  war &amp; its results upon the war upon the world    ENDENTRY March 25, 1855    writing I attended Prayer meeting in the evening    ENDENTRY March 26, 1855 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY March 30, 1855       ENDENTRY March 31, 1855    some of my own but did not find them I then rode to the  Toille valley &amp; spent the night with Brother  Maughn ^I attended a conference of Elders in the evening^ Distance of the day 40 mils    ENDENTRY April 1, 1855    assembled from the different settlements in the valley for  a general meeting I preached to them in the forenoon. we  had a great shower of rain in the afternoon &amp; during the night  yet Brother Benson preached to them in the after noon we  had a good meeting I spent the night with Brother Cory    ENDENTRY April 2, 1855    return home &amp; spent the night at home 40 mils    ENDENTRY April 3, 1855 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY April 5, 1855       ENDENTRY April 6, 1855    at 10 oclock.

He was  followed By President Young in an interesting discourse upon  the subject of our building up the Kingdom of God, Having faith,  trusting in God under all circumstances in life his discourse  was reported.    some interesting teaching from President Young in social  conversation which was not reported. the following is a key  to some of the principles He advanced. He refered to the preach- ing of Orson Hyde the sabbath before upon the subj- ect of the resurrection. He said the Identical particles of matter  in which we had honored our spirits with  which we had suffered, travelled, laboured, &amp; built up the kingdom  of God that would be the Identical body &amp; no other that would be  raised from the grave to immortality &amp; Eternal life. Adam &amp; Eve  had lived upon another Earth were immortal when they came here  Adam assisted in forming this Earth &amp; agreed to fall when He  came Here &amp; He fell that man might be &amp; the opposite principle  to good the devel, the serpent, the Evil was plased upon the Earth that  man might know the good from the Evil for without an Experience  in these things man could not know the one from the other as soon  as the devil was on Earth He sowed the seeds of Death in evry thing  so as soon as they began to eat of the fruit of the Earth they received  into their system the seeds of mortality &amp; of Death so their children  wer mortal &amp; subject to death sorrow pain &amp; wo then when they  partook of life, Joy, ease, &amp; Happiness they would know how to prize it  Father Adam would never scease his labours to redeem his posterity  &amp; exhalt them to all the glory they were capable of receiving He did  not doubt but that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many  of his posterity would receive a Celestial glory &amp; who they were &amp; also a Terrestrial &amp; a Telestial yet man had his agency to act  chuse &amp; refuse good or evil as seemed him good &amp; he would be rew- arded according to his works. O. Pratt asks will Adam or any God con- tinue to make worlds people them taste of Death to redeem them   ENDENTRY  will do it is a question in my mind. How then can his seed increase  to all Eternity, through the increase of his posterity.       ENDENTRY May 7, 1855     for $54.
