 Feb 21st[18]91    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Box B. Salt Lake City Utah.  Dear Brother:    Many questions ar-  rise during our experience in this mission some of ^which^   I and my brethren are unable to answer.  One particu-  larly rises in my mind and that one is the rise, pro-  gress and winding up of the Kirtland Bank.  So   far as any published information is concerned we have   failed to find out much in relation to this subject.    In a general way we know it was established and   we believe all its l[i]abilities cancelled when it suspended   payment.  Perhaps Bro. Reynolds will take the trouble to col-  late a few items and send here to enlighten our ignorance.    It is customary for the president of the mission to visit  the Swiss & German missions and also the Scandinavian  country, I believe Bro Teasdale neglected it last year   and the brethren who preside wish to know the time  when I can come to them.  I expect to go soon but   would like your sanction to do so.    Have rented a small ready furnished house about  one hour from 42 situated at New Brighton, we   all feel that to spend the summer here will be too   great a drain on our health.  We shall try and pay   for the rent. 
 I am sure you will agree with us in doing   what we deem best for the general health.  I was   obliged to send Mrs. Y. away she was so much reduced.    I understand that a great amount of money   has been borrowed in New York by our brethren re-  cently.  Now I am quite sure that their securities  are used to get British gold to meet these loans &  those in N. Y. pay about 4% while our brethren   pay from 6% 8% 10%  The way might just   as well be opened and avoid borrowing of money   in this Country.  Give this matter consideration   I bring it before your notice for this purpose.    We are all well here or rather better than   we have been.

 to avoid complecation, that it should be done   soon as convenient.  I have thought strongly   of haveing something of the kind here in this  country.  It is understood that Christian  ministers are licensed and we are more liable   to persecution without license.  I shall investi-  gate the matter a little more carefully than  I have been able to do and if the spirit  consents and you do not object obtain   license for some one or more of the brethren.    You will pardon my writing so often  but this time I am much exercised in spirit   in relation to one missionary in Turkey.    We are suffeering from colds.

 estimates of everything should ^you^ entertain this prosi-  tion favorably. We are fully convinced that it ^this plan^ will  cost no more money, and ; two rooms for the Book keeping  and mailing stars and tracks would answer every pur-  pose. We are generally introuble with our workmen  etc and we dwell in the outskirts of the lost. Not  one object or thing that may be seen from the windows  of 42 suggest one pleasant or, virtuous thought  w  beholders. When prest. Teasdale wrote me that a big lump came  in his throat when leaving 42. I wrote him that, "There is one  thing settled with me, to appreciate heaven well; it is good  for a man to have about fifteen minutes in hell."

 DESERET NEWS:  WEEKLY.    TRUTH AND LIBERTY.    PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE  DESERET NEWS COMPANY.    CHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.    WEDNESDAY,—Oct. 12, 1887.    AN EPISTLE    To the Members of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints.    INTRODUCTORY.    Dear Brethren and Sisters:    It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighth  Semi-annual Conference of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  that an Epistle should be addressed to  the members of the Church, in con-  forminty with the custom which has  been observed at the past five General  Conferences.    DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.    As some of the Apostles are pre-  vented, by circumstances well known  to the Saints, from appearing in pub-  lic, the Church will naturally look for   some expression from them concern-  ing their feelings and hopes respecting   the work of our God. Especially at the  present time is deep interest felt in the  utterances of the Apostles, because of   the loss which the Church has sus-  tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHN  TAYLOR. Twice before has the Church  mourned the death of its President,  and each time the event has produced  a profound impression upon its mem  bers. In this instance this sad event  is invested with more significance than  it would have been had it occurred in  the ordinary way. President Taylor  died in exile. For about two years  and a half he had been compelled to  live in seclusion, and to refrain from  all public association with the people  whom he loved more than he did life.    Through his decease the Church is  called the third time to mourn the de-  parture of the man who has stood as  its President and as the Prophet, Seer  and Revelator to this generation. The   experience which the Saints have  gained in passing though these trials  has been of exceeding value to them.   They have learned that God can take  care of his own work, and that they  need not worry nor yield to anxiety or   doubt concerning its management.    After the martyrdom of the Prophet  Joseph Smith there were pretenders who as-  serted that they had the right to take  his place at the head of the Church.  Some were deceived by their preten-  sions, not being familiar with the or-  der of the Priesthood.    THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE   APOSTLES.  For some time before his death the  Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired of the  Lord to aniticipate his own departure  from earthly scenes. This was shown  in various ways; bu especially in the  great anxiety which he displayed to  bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all  the keys and authority of the Holy  Priesthood which he had received. He   declared in private and in public that   they were equipped and fully qualified,  and that he had rolled the kingdom of  God on to the shoulders of the Twelve   Apostles.    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONAL   TESTIMONY.    I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last  man living in the flesh who was pres-  ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I   owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints, to the House of   Israel, and to the whole world to bear   this my last testimony to all nations,   that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph   Smith, the Prophet of God, called the  Twelve Apostles together in the City   of Nauvoo, and spent many days with  us in giving us our endowments, and  teaching us those glorious principles  which God had revealed to him. And  upon one occasion he stood upon his  feet in our midst for nearly three   hours declaring unto us the great and   last dispensation which God had set   His hand to perform upon the earth in  these last days. The room was filled  as if with consuming fire; the Prophet  was clothed upon with much of the  power of God, and his face shone and   was transparently clear, and he closed   that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in   time or in eternity, with the following  language:    "Brethren, I have had great sorrow  of heart for fear that I might be taken   from the earth with the keys of the   Kingdom of God upon me, without  sealing them upon the heads of other   men. God has sealed upon my head   all the keys of the Kingdom of God   necessary for organizing and build-  ing up of the Church, Zion, and   Kingdom of God upon the earth, and   to prepare the Saints for the coming   of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I   thank God I have lived to see the day  that I have been enabled to give you   your endowments, and I have now  sealed upon your heads all the powers    of the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest-  hoods and Apostleship, with all the  keys and powers thereof, which God  has sealed upon me; and I now roll off  all the labor, burden and care of this   Church and Kingdom of God upon   your shoulders, and I now command  you in the name of the Lord Jesus   Christ to round up your shoulders, and  bear off this Church and Kingdom of  God before heaven and earth, and be-  fore God, angels and men; and if you  don't do it you will be damned."    And the same spirit that filled the  room at that time burns in my bosom  while I record this testimony, and the  Prophet of God appointed no one else   but the Twelve Apostles to stand at   the head of the Church and direct its  affairs.    THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.  When the Prophet Joseph had  passed away by foul assassination,  those who possessed the Spirit of God   and were living in close communion   with it, knew the voice of the true   shepherd and were not deceived by the  claims of men who pretended to have   authority. The body of the Church  followed the leadership of those whom  God had chosen, and whom His ser-  vant Joseph had been instructed to  prepare for this great responsibility.  The Twelve Apostles, with President   Brigham Young as their head, became   the presiding council of the Church.    The lessons which the Church then  learned in regard to the Priesthood,   and the rights of the Priesthood, have  never been forgotten. When Presi-  dent Young was taken from us, there  was no jar nor division of sentiment  among the Apostles; and among the   people there was scarcely a question as  to where the right of Presidency rest-  ed. President John Taylor took the  position which belonged to him, and   the work of God moved forward with-  out interruption, and with a union and  harmony on the part of all connected  with it, most delightful to wit-  ness. He has stood at our head  for nearly ten years, and during that  period he has possessed the gifts and  qualifications which belonged to his   high office and calling. His entire   career is one that can be contemplated  with the utmost satisfaction and pleas-  ure by all who love the truth and ad-  mire integrity in those who are called  to be servants of God. From the time  that he was baptized a member of the  Church until his spirit took its flight   from earth, he never wavered in his ad-  vocacy and defense of the principles of  righteousness. Under all the varied   circumstances through which he and  the people of God were called to pass,  in the midst of the deepest trials and  afflictions, his voice was always raised   in tones of encouragement and hope;   and when the storms were the fiercest,   he rose to the occasion and always  displayed undaunted courage and un-  flinching devotion to the Zion of God.  In the providence of God it fell to his   lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and   Patriarch Hyrum when they were   martyred for the truth, and he mingled  his own blood with theirs. Though   severely wounded on that occasion,   he miraculously escaped death. He   was a man whom the Lord loved.   The evidence of this is to be found in  the fact that He [c]hose him to preside   over His Church at the departure of  His servant Brigham. We feel thank-  ful to God our Eternal Father that we  have been permitted to live with and   enjoy the society of President John   Taylor and be his fellow-laborers.  Our association with him and the   Presidents and Apostles who have  gone before him into the spirit world,  we esteem as a great honor. We take  delight in anticipating the rejoicing   that we shall have when we shall be  permitted to mingle in their society.    Once more, the responsibility of  presiding over the Church has fallen   upon the Council of the Twelve  Apostles. The Counselors of Presi-  dent Taylor, Brothers George Q.   Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being   members of the Council of the Twelve   Apostles at the time they were chosen  to be members of the First Presidency,   have, since his death, taken their places   again as members of that Council.    Fifty-seven years and a half have   elapsed since the Church was organ-  ized. In looking around among those  with whom we associate to-day, how  few there are left of those who, under   the Lord, helped to lay the  foundation of this work and were the  companions of the Prophet in the  early labors connected therewith!   To-day there is but one Apostle left of  those who belonged to the Council   of the Apostles during the lifetime of   the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at the  time these valleys were first settled.   The other faithful Apostles who were  ordained under the direction of the  Prophet Joseph have all passed behind  the vail. Since the death of President  Young four have joined him in the  other world, and in the same period  six have been ordained as members   of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.  This gives some idea of the changes  which are occurring, and how rapidly  a new generation is taking an active   part in the building up of Zion.    THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.  Those of us who have been at liberty  to travel, have devoted our time to   visiting the various Stakes, and in   meeting with them at their Quarterly  Conferences. Some of us have been  laboring in Mexico, others in Arizona,  besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho   and in Utah. These Quarterly Con-  ferences are attended with excellent  results. The people come together   and receive instructions and coun-  sel upon leading topics, and  much good is derived therefrom.    Though it involves considerable labor  for the Apostles to visit them, yet we  are encouraged in doing so by the ad-  vantages which those visits bring to   the people in keeping them informed  concerning general movements and   counsel. In these labors we have had  much joy and satisfaction, especially  in witnessing the increase of faithful-  ness on the part of the Saints.    THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.  Though many of the leading men  have been compelled to be absent,   some of them having been incarcer-  ated in prison, the people have, never-  theless, been steadfast, and have   sought with increased diligence to per-  form their duties. The persecution to  which they have been subjected has  led the people to think and act for  themselves, and not depend so  much upon others for guidance. This   can not fail to be attended with good   results. It is necessary that all the   members of the Church should exer-  cise their powers of reason and reflec-  tion and thoroughly understand why  they take the course which God points  out. Intelligent obedience on the part  of His Saints is desired by our Father   in heaven. He has given us our agency  to think and act for ourselves,   on our own volition, to obtain a   testimony for ourselves from Him   concerning the truth of the principles  which He teaches, and then be firm  and unshaken in the performance of  all which is necessary for salvation.    We have felt great satisfaction in  witnessing the dignity and courage   which the Saints have exhibited   through the trials of the past three   years. Their conduct has been ad-  mirable. They have displayed great  qualities. The forbearance, patience   and fortitude which they have ex-  hibited are proofs that God has been  with them. Outrages which would   have goaded any other people into acts   of violence have been of frequent oc-  currence. In other communities men   and women would be desperate under  such treatment. But the Lord has   given His people power to control   themselves and peace has been main-  tained. Riots and bloodshed have   been avoided, and even under strong   provocation, when blood was shed, the  community restrained itself. Preju-  dice may prevent our nation and its   rulers from acknowledging, at the   present, how noble the demeanor of  the people has been under  these trying circumstances, and   with the strong provocations   which they have had to indulge in  outbreaks; yet the time will come  when all this will receive its proper  recognition and due credit will be ac-  corded the Latter-day Saints for their   magnanimity and self-control through-  out this entire persecution.    PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.  In the organizations which have   been established among our people in   all our settlements in these moun-  tains, the advancement and training  and benefit of all classes are amply   provided for. Among no people of   whom we know anything have such   provisions been made for the salvation  and care of the members of society of  all ages as among the Latter-day  Saints.  If we and our children do not  progress in intelligence and in the   knowledge of all principles pertaining  to life here and life hereafter, it is be-  cause we do not avail ourselves of   those facilities which are placed within  our reach. We have the Primary As-  sociations provided for the benefit of  the young children of our Church, and  their instruction in those simple prin-  ciples which they can understand. We  also have Sunday schools for the  training and education of those of   larger growth. In them they can learn  the doctrines of salvation and the his-  tory of the work of God, and be pre-  pared for greater progress. Then we   have the Young Mens' and Young   Ladies' Mutual Improvement Asso-  ciations, which have been organized, as  their names imply, for the development   of the young people of both sexes and   their advancement in every thing that  will qualify them for lives of useful-  ness and honor. But besides these or-  ganizations we have the various coun-  cils of the Priesthood, to some office  in which every young man who is   worthy can be ordained. The young  women, as they increase in years, can  also find a sphere of usefulness in the  Relief Societies which have been or-  ganized for the purpose of assisting   the Bishops and Counselors and   Teachers of the Wards in caring for   the poor and relieving the wants of the   suffering and distressed. So that by  means of these organizations, which  are of vast interest to us as a people,   every one from early childhood to ma-  turity, can be led forward step by step,  from one degree of knowledge to an-  other until fully qualified to discharge  all the duties of perfected and honor-  able manhood and womanhood.    So far as we know the sisters who  have charge of the Primary Associa-  tions are doing a most commendable  work in arousing interest in the lit-  tle ones and in teaching them  in simple style those lessons   which are adapted to their under-  standings. We hope that in all our  settlements these associations will re-  ceive the constant care and attention   of our wise and judicious sisters. The  seed sown in the hearts of the children  by the instructions imparted there  will produce in years to come an   abundant harvest that will gladden   the hearts of the Saints who witness it.    OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.  The progress of the Sunday School   cause in Zion continues satisfactory,   though undoubtedly somewhat re-  tarded by the enforced absence from  its labors and associations of so many   brethren and sisters who have in  former years taken an active interest   in its welfare. We notice, with pleas-  ure, the constantly increasing number   of schools, teachers and scholars re-  ported by the officers of the Union and   the evident care taken by the presiding   local authorities in our settlements to  have a Sunday School as one of the  first institutions established. We  are also gratified to learn that  in most of the foreign missions  of the Church Sunday Schools  and Improvement Associations   are being organized wherever   practicable. In Great Britain, in Con-  tinental Europe, in New Zealand, and   in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the   branches scattered throughout the  missions in the United States, these  institutions are found contributing   their influence in instructing and   forming the character of the children  of the Latter-day Saints.    The Mutual Improvement Societies  are also accomplishing great good   throughout our settlements. In connec-  tion with them and the Sunday Schools,  we desire to remind our brethren and   sisters who are engaged in the praise-  worthy labor of fostering these insti-  tutions, that the original design in  organizing Sunday Schools and Im-  provement Societies among us was,   that the children and youth of the   Saints should be made wise in the  principles of the Gospel and their faith  be developed in the revelations of  God. This the officers and teachers   should keep constantly in mind. The  books used should be almost without   exception, the revelations of God as  contained in ancient and modern  Scripture, together with the other   works of the Church. The teachings,   while direct, brief and simple, should  be such as will increase the faith, de-  velop the veneration and love, and   draw out the intelligence of the youth-  ful bearers toward the divine princi-  ples of which by God's grace, we have   been made the custodians. All at-  tempts, however slight, to secularize   these institutions and to change them  so that they will not accomplish the  ends sought for in their creation,   should be discountenanced. The  spirit and teachings of the Gospel  should hold undivided control in all  our ministrations connected with this  cause. In the theological and other   classes all discussions should be   avoided as much as possible on sub-  jects which God in His wisdom has not  yet fully revealed. We know there are  many persons who appear to take more   delight in dwelling upon questions  which are mysterious and cannot very   well, in our present state of knowl-  edge, be answered than they do upon   those subjects which are plain and  simple and essential to present pro-  gress. But the Lord has revealed   so much that we can understand   and that we ought to learn in order to  be useful in the labors devolving upon  us here, that we need not enter into  discussion on subjects which in no   way affect our happiness here or eter-  nal salvation hereafter. In our theo-  logical classes, quorum meetings and  other assemblies, therefore, these de-  batable questions need not be dis-  cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the   time of the members, to the exclusion  of more profitable topics. In the   Primary Associations, the Sunday  schools and the Mutual Improvement   Associations, singing should receive a  arge share of attention. Singing ex-  ercises can be made a great attraction   and also a valuable addition to the ed-  ucation of the young. The interest   that is now taken among us in vocal   and instrumental music is a marked  feature of the times, and this taste   finds increasing opportunities for its   development in the facilities which are  now being furnished to all who desire  its cultivation. Instead of having a   select few act as choirs in these  institutions to do the singing for the  whole, the voices of all should   be united in harmonious melody  in giving utterance to the feelings of  their hearts in hymns and songs. This  will increase the pleasure of the meet-  ings, and make all feel that they have   an equal interest in worship and re-  joicing.    THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.  The mission of the Relief Societies  as organized among us, is truly grand   and beneficent. There is no limit to  their labors and usefulness while suf-  fering and want exist in our midst. To  aid the needy by feeding the hungry   and clothing the destitute is distinc-  tively and peculiarly their mission. In  the energetic performance of their  duty human sympathy and divine  mercy are beautifully harmonized. In   extending relief to the poor, the love  of God and of our fellows is clearly   manifest. It is more praiseworthy for  a relief society to be able to say  "There are none in our Ward in need  of food, raiment or shelter," than to   report thousands of dollars in hand,  while the needs of the poor are un-  supplied.    These societies have done a vast   amount of good among us, and the  members have been of great service in  assisting the Priesthood in the wards   in caring for the destitute and in sup-  plying the wants of those who have  been in need of help. In these labors  we desire to give them every encour-  agement and to invoke the blessing of   heaven upon them, and all their exer-  tions for the benefit of suffering hu-  manity.    THE CARE OF THE POOR.  As the winter season is approaching,   it is proper that each Bishop and his   Counselors should take the necessary  steps to properly care for the poor  who live in their wards. They should  call the Relief Societies to their aid in   this labor. The reasonable wants of  the poor should be supplied and the  pangs of poverty and destitution  should be averted. God has greatly   blessed us in the fruits of our fields  and gardens, in our flocks and herds,   and in giving us comfortable habita-  tions and means to sustain ourselves,  and we should always remember the   words of the Apostle James: "Pure   religion and undefiled before God and  the Father is this, to visit the father-  less and widows in their affliction,   and to keep himself unspotted from the   world."    While it has always been the  policy of our people to encourage in-  dustry and to repress idleness in every   form, and to expect all persons to   contribute, according to their ability,   to their own support; still there are  many cases where the aged and the in-  firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with   the utmost exertion and economy, ob-  tain through their own labors suffi-  cient to sustain themselves. It would   be a great evil among us to encourage   any class in living upon the benevo-  lence of the community. No system   of begging should be permitted.  Those able to work should be fur-  nished employment. Persons who are  properly disposed will be glad to ob-  tain it in preference to being fed with  the bread of charity; and all should   be encouraged to labor according to  their strength. This policy, if wisely  pursued will prevent pauperism, de-  velop self-exertion and confidence, and  produce self-respect. It is a cause  of great pleasure to think that beg-  gary is unknown throughout our set-  tlements. There is no need for any-  one, however destitute, to publicly  solicit alms. But while this is the   case, the sensitive and those who   shrink from asking aid, who conceal,  in some instances, their poverty,   should be carefully looked after by the  Relief Societies under the direction of  the Bishops of the wards, so that there   may be no individual in any of our  wards suffering for the want of food or  any other article necessary to sustain   or preserve life. The community whose  hearts are open to the cries of distress,   who are ready to administer of the  substance which the Lord gives them   to relieve their fellow creatures, may   always depend upon the favor of the  Lord, for He loves those who are kind  to their fellow-men, and who admin-  ister to their necessities, whose hearts  are tender, and who readily respond to  applications of this character which   are made upon them, or who antici-  pate them by giving freely to the desti-  tute.    FAST OFFERINGS.  In some of our wards there is not  proper care taken in the collection of   the fast offerings of the people. The  first Thursday in the month has been   set apart in the Church as a day of  fasting and of prayer. That day should   be strictly observed. Fast offerings  should be brought with a liberal hand  to the Bishop of each ward, that he  may be prepared to supply those who   are dependent upon the ward for sus-  tenance. Some wards require consid-  erable aid from the Church to help   sustain their poor, because their own  fast offerings do not supply them;  while sometimes in the same Stake  there are other wards where there are  few, if any, dependent poor. Presidents   of Stakes should make arrangements   with the Bishops of the last named   wards to transfer their fast offerings  to the Bishop of some contiguous  ward which has more poor within its  borders than its own fast offerings  will supply. In this way all the peo-  ple can have an equal opportunity of  doing their duty to the poor.    THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.  Experience has abundantly proved   that those who are attentive to those  and all other duties required by the  Lord receive His blessing. God does   bless those who devote themselves   with singleness of purpose to His  work. If proof of this were needed,   one has only to notice the condition of  Elders in the various settlements who  have spent years of their lives upon  missions. Though their home affairs  may have been left to the care of their  wives and children, they are not dis-  tinguished by their poverty from their   fellow-servants who have remained at   home.    We have only to look around us to  satisfy ourselves also, that those who  are generous in contributing to God's   work are favored of the Lord. This  was the experience of ancient Israel,  and it is our experience. Yet in re-  gard to voluntary donations there is  too much carelessness, notwithstand-  ing all the precious promises con-  nected therewith. The Saints should   be reminded of the obligation which  rests upon them. Our children, also,  should be taught this duty, that it may  become a fixed habit with them to  punctually attend to these matters.   Those who have strictly observed   these requirements can testify to the  great pleasure and many rewards they  have received from their observance.    This law of liberality appears to be  one of the safeguards which the Lord  has adopted to avert from his people  the evil consequences which follow   the possession of wealth. He has told  us that the riches of the earth are His   to give; but He has warned us to be-  ware of pride, lest we become as the  Nephites of old. We know the ruin it  wrought for them, and we should   spare no precaution to prevent wealth   having a disastrous effect upon us.  Many can endure poverty and be hum-  ble and live near the Lord who cannot  bear riches. They become lifted up in

 Oct. 12 THE DESERET NEWS    pride and become covetous, and for-  get their God. Those, however, who  remember constantly the teachings of   the Lord concerning the earth and its  inhabitants, and who contribute of the  means which the Lord gives them to   assist the poor and help carry forward   the work of God, exercise a check upon  themselves and give Satan less power  to lead them astray. Under the pres-  ent system of affairs, those who ac-  cumulate wealth and are able to sup-  ply themselves and their families with  luxuries and advantages that are de-  nied their neighbors, are in danger of   becoming separated from the bulk of   the people and forming a distinct   class. But the day will come when a  more perfect order will be introduced.  Then it will be said there are no poor  and no rich in Zion—that is, we shall   not be divided into classes, but shall   all possess everything of this charac-  ter necessary for our comfort and hap-  piness. But until then, if we wish our   families and ourselves to remain Lat-  ter-day Saints, we must be especially  careful to guard against the deceitful-  ness of riches.    THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.  The great labor which devolves upon   us, as members of the Church, is to   build up Zion. God has founded Zion,   and we should seek to extend its bene-  fits and blessings unto all mankind. It  should be our constant care to do   nothing that will weaken its influence  or power or retard its growth in the   earth. This we should constantly im-  press also, upon our children, that  they may grow up filled with an abid-  ing love for the work of God.    There has been too much neglect  on this point. Many have pursued a   short-sighted, selfish policy; and have  worked to that which they believed   was their own individual advantage  without regard to the effect their ac-  tion would have upon the work of God.   Their eyes have not been single to His  glory. Such a disposition has proved  a snare to those who have indulged in  it; they have wrought injury to them-  selves, not to mention the effect their   conduct has had upon Zion.    THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.  The Lord has informed us that mar-  riage is ordained of God unto man.   The institution of marriage, in some  communities of which we read, is fall-  ing almost into disrepute. It is al-  leged that there is a growing tendency  in this direction among us. The cause  is doubtless, traceable to the in-  crease of wealth and the dis-  inclination of young men to take   upon them the burdens of a wife and  family. As we depart from the sim-  plicity of early days, we may naturally  expect that this tendency will increase  as young men may be restrained from   offering marriage to young ladies un-  less they can give them something like   as comfortable a home as they enjoy  under their parents' roof. Extrava-  gant or luxuriant habits or training on   the part of the girls will also have the  effect to deter young men from marry-  ing. Care should be taken by every   person of influence to counteract this   tendency, and to set before the rising   generation the advantages which fol-  low well-arranged marriages. No  community can prosper and maintain   a high standard of morality where  there is a large percentage of unmar-  ried young men and young women.  We should deplore the increase of   such a class among us, and all honor-  able means should be used to prevent   its existence. The young of both   sexes should be taught that it is not  necessary to happiness in marriage to  be in the possession of wealth. In   this country an industrious, economi-  cal married couple can soon surround   themselves with all the conveniences  and comforts essential to life and hap-  piness. The satisfaction each will   have in after years in the enjoyment   of the fruits of their joint industry and   thrift will amply repay them for any in-  conveniences or privations they may   have been subjected to in the early   days of their married life. The com-  forts thus accumulated will be doubly  sweetened unto them by the recollec-  tion of their exertions in common to   procure them. No rightly constituted  and educated young woman will refuse   an offer of marriage from a worthy, in-  dustrious young man for no other rea-  son than that he is not able to surround  her at first with the comforts which   she may think she ought to have.   Young men, who have a due share of  the qualities which women esteem in  a husband, need not be afraid that girls  of that kind will refuse them, because  they may not be well endowed with this   world's goods. They will cheer-  fully bear their part of the burdens of  life without repining when confident of   the love and supporting and guiding  hand of their husbands.    AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.  We feel led to caution the Latter-  day Saints against forming the bad   habit of incurring debt and taking  upon themselves obligations which fre-  quently burden them heavier than they  can bear, and lead to the loss of their  homes and other possessions. We know  it is the fashion of the age to use credit   to the utmost limit, and it is custom-  ary for nations, states, counties and   cities to borrow money, issue bonds   and thus load themselves with taxes   to such an extent that large numbers  of the people are prevented from own-  ing land or even the houses which they  occupy. Thus the masses become ten-  ants and have to pay rent for land and   shelter. This is a great evil and one  that we, as a people and as individuals,   should carefully shun. Our business  should be done, as much as possible,   on the principle of paying for that  which we purchase, and our needs    should be brought within the limit of   our resources. The disposition to  speculate and to take chances upon   ventures of one kind and another  should be repressed. There are many  people who have been rendered home-  less in our Territory by the neglect of   this precaution. To raise funds to in-  vest in some scheme which has ap-  peared promising they have mortgaged   their homes, only too often, to be dis-  appointed and to find themselves with-  out a place of shelter for themselves   and their families. All this is wrong.  If the penalty for such unwisdom fell  upon the one through whose acts and   influence it is brought about, the con-  sequences would not be so deplorable;   but very frequently families suffer   and the bad results are widely   felt. We, therefore, repeat our   counsel to the Latter-day Saints,   to shun debt. Be content with mod-  erate gains, and be not misled by illu-  sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re-  member the saying of the wise man:   "But he that hasteth to get rich   shall not be innocent." Let our chil-  dren also be taught habits of economy,  and not to indulge in tastes which   they cannot gratify without running in  debt.    ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.  We have been favored, as no other  people have, with wise counsels.   Their extent and variety are immeas-  urable. They cover every department   of human life. So far as we have ob-  served them, prosperity and happiness  have been the results. Whatever  difficulties we may have to contend   with to-day are due, if not wholly, at   least in great part, to our disregard of  them. Is not this the experience and  testimony of all the faithful Saints   who have watched the progress of  events among us? Had we observed  these counsels, how many of the evils  from which we now suffer would   never have been known among us!   Our neglect of them has brought its  punishment, and the faithful can see  it. But shall we not profit by the ex-  perience of the past and act more wise-  ly in the future? As the Lord has said  (Doctrine and Covenants, sec. ##Doctrine and Covenants 90:36-37|90, ver.   36 37##),    "But verily I say unto you, that I, the   Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead  with her strong ones, and chasten her until  she overcomes and is clean before me: For  she shall not be removed out of her place,   I, the Lord, have spoken it."    We should begin to understand that   God's ways are infinitely superior to  our ways, and that His counsels,  though they may seem to call for   sacrifice, are always the best and the  safest for us to adopt and carry out.  Thousands among us can testify to the  truth of this from individual experi-  ence. These thousands should com-  bine and create a public opinion in fa-  vor of obedience to the counsel of   heaven that will have its proper effect   upon our children and the inexperi-  enced among us.    THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.  We also should learn this great   truth, that God will have all the glory  and honor for the establishment of  His Church and Kingdom on the  earth. Man cannot claim it in this or  any other age of the world. Nothing  but the power of God could have  brought forth the fullness of the Gos-  pel, organized the Church, gathered   His people to Zion in fulfillment of  revelation and performed the work   which has been accomplished. There-  fore, as Latter-day Saints, we are  obliged to acknowledge the hand of  God in all the blessings we enjoy.    THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.  It should be the aim of all the mem-  bers of the Church to carry out prac-  tically in their lives the principles of   the Gospel. In no way can we better   convince the world of their truth than  in showing in our acts and dealings   with one another and with  mankind the elevating effect they  have upon us. We make high profes-  sions, and there should be such a high  standard of purity of life among us as  to correspond with these professions.   Our children should be impressed with  this, and be taught that the name of   Saint is so holy that they only who  are pure in heart can claim it.    If our religion does not lead us to  love our God and our fellow man and  to deal justly and uprightly with all  men, then our profession of it is vain.  The Apostle says:    "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his  brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not  his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he  love God whom he hath not seen?"    We can best exemplify our love for  our God by living our religion. It is   vain to profess a love for God while   speaking evil of or doing wrong to His   children. The sacred covenants we   have made with Him strictly impose   upon us the duties we owe to one   another; and the great office of religion  is to teach us how to perform those   duties so as to produce the greatest   happiness for ourselves and for our   fellow-beings. When the obligations   of our religion are observed, no words   are spoken or acts are committed that  would injure a neighbor. If the Lat-  ter-day Saints lived as they should do,  and as their religion teaches   them to do, there would be   no feeling in any breast but   that of brotherly and sisterly affection   and love. Backbiting and evil-speak-  ing would have no existence among   us; but peace and love and good will   would reign in all our hearts and hab-  itations and settlements. We would   be the happiest people on the face of   the earth, and the blessing and peace    of Heaven would rest upon us and   upon all that belongs to us.    If there be unhappiness and heart-  burnings and quarrelings and hatreds  among us, they exist because we do   not observe the religion which we pro-  fess. They are not its fruits. Where  these evils exist there is a crying ne-  cessity for repentance. If any feel in-  jured by the words or acts of their  brethren and sisters, the Gospel points  out and furnishes the way by which   this injury may be repaired. Instead  of talking about this to others they  should go to the person or persons   who have done the wrong and make  their feelings known. If satisfaction  is then made, that ought to end the  matter; but if not, it can be reported  to the proper officers of the Church  for them to take the necessary steps to  terminate the difficulties. In this way  animosities and disunion can be pre-  vented and confidence is maintained.    PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.  As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen-  eral custom to partake of the  sacrament once a week. If  the teachings of our Lord,   in remembrance of whom we observe  this sacred ordinance, be regarded, no   one who has trespassed can be per-  mitted to share in it until he has made   reconciliation. It is the express com-  mandment of the Lord Jesus that no  one shall be permitted to partake of  His flesh and blood unworthily. A  more perfect system to prevent the  existence of improper feelings and   wrongs among brethren and sisters  can not be imagined. If the Saints do   their duty, difficulties do not remain   unsettled beyond the Lord's day when  they assemble to eat and drink in re-  membrance of Him.    TEMPLE WORK.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that  the Saints have had to contend with of   late, they have pursued their labors in  every direction with unabated zeal.   This is particularly noticable in their   attendance at the Temples. The wish  to avail themselves of the opportuni-  ties for attending to the ordinances for  themselves and their deceased friends  has, if anything, increased, and those   employed in these sacred buildings  have their time fully occupied in per-  forming their duties there. It is evi-  dent that the Latter-day Saints ap-  preciate the blessings to be obtained   through this Temple work. When we   reflect that we have two buildings of   this character already completed,  furnishing abundant facilities for  all who choose to go there to   obtain the ordinances of God's   house for themselves and for  those in whose salvation they take  so deep an interest, and that we have   another Temple at Manti nearing com-  pletion, and one in Salt Lake City,   which we hope to see finished before  long, our hearts are filled with glad-  ness and we cannot refrain from prais-  ing our God for His goodness unto His  people in permitting them, notwith-  standing the opposition and many dif-  ficulties they have had to contend with,   to erect such structures and to   dedicate them, according to the pat-  tern He have given for these sacred  uses.    No right feeling Latter-day Saint   can think upon this subject without  being thrilled with heavenly joy for   what God has done for us in our gener-  ation, furnishing us, as He has done,  with every facility to prepare us, our  posterity and our ancestors for that   eternal world which lies beyond the  present life. The Latter-day Saints   are, in truth, a highly favored people,  and praise to God should ascend from   every heart and habitation in our land  for the great mercy and goodness  which He has shown unto us. He has  made us promises of the most precious  character, and he has fulfilled them up  to the present time. We would be the  most ungrateful and unworthy people  that ever lived if, after receiving such   wonderful manifestations of His good-  ness, we slackened in our diligence or  failed in our obedience and devotion  to Him and His great cause.    FOREIGN MISSIONS.  The treatment which the Elders have  received in preaching the Gospel  throughout the Southern States, as  we are informed by President John  Morgan, has been much better of late  than it has been at some other periods.  The Elders are listened to with more  patience and do not meet with so much  of the spirit of mobocracy and un-  reasoning hate. Additions are being   made to the Church, and those who   emigrate from that region have gener-  ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo-  rado.    The Elders in the North Western   States under the direction of President   W. M. Palmer, pursue their labors  with undiminished zeal and with mod-  erate success in bringing people into   the Church. These fields of labor   have furnished opportunities for num-  bers of our young men to gain experi-  ence in missionary efforts, and those  who have this privilege return home,  in the most of instances, better quali-  fied to assist the local authorities  where they reside in the labors of the  ministry.    In Great Britain the Elders meet   with considerable opposition in places,  principally, however, from apostates.  They find that field a much more dif-  ficult one than it was in former years.   The hearts of the people seem to have  become hardened, and great indiffer-  ence prevails in regard to religion.   Still we learn from President George  Teasdale, who presides at the present  time over the European Mission, that  the Elders who zealously enter into    the labors of the ministry find abund-  ant cause for rejoicing in the success   which attends their exertions.   Throughout the Swiss and German   Mission presided over by Elder Fred-  erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina-  vian Mission presided over by Elder N.   C. Flygare, the Elders are laboring  also with commendable zeal and with   gratifying results. An effort is being   made at the present time to preach the  Goepe[l][Gospel] in Turkey, where Elders Jacob  Spori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintze  have been, and are laboring, and even  the land of Palestine has been visited,   and in the late company of emigrants   which reached this City from Europe,   nine persons were gathered who had   received the Gospel in that  land, a land hallowed to  us as the earthly home of   our Redeemer, and the soil of which   his sacred feet trod.    On the Sandwich Islands the Elders  are laboring faithfully under the direc-  tion of President William King, and  everything is being done to improve  the condition of that people and to   save them from the destruction which  threatens the extinction of the race.  The plantation at Laie is still main-  tained, and the Elders who have la-  bored and who are still laboring there   enter with spirit into the management  of that property in a way to benefit as   much as possible the native Saints.   The attention of the Elders there is di-  rected at present to the Navigator   Islands, where some few years ago  two native Elders from the Sandwich   Islands were successful in baptizing a  large number of natives and organizing   them into branches. These Islands   have not been visited by any of the  white Elders, but it is probable that  some of our Elders on the Sandwich   Islands may in the near future make a  visit there.    The letters which we receive   from New Zealand where Presi-  dent William Paxman presides,   continue to bring us gratifying intelli-  gence concerning the condition and  progress of the work there. The   Elders are very successful among the  Maories. Many of the white brethren   have succeeded in acquiring the lan-  guage of that race, which is cognate to   that of the Sandwich Islands, and two of  them, Elders Ezra T. Richards and  Sondra Sanders, Jr., are now en-  gaged, we are informed, in translating   the Book of Mormon into the Maori   language. In Australia the Elders are   also laboring, but it is a much harder  field than among the natives of New  Zealand.    HOME MANUFACTURES.  Frequent reference has been made in  past teachings and in former Epistles   to the subject of home manufactures.   It has been, and we feel it still ought  to be, a theme of inexhaustible inter-  est to Zion; yet there remains an im-  mense amount to be done in develop-  ing our resources and furnishing facil-  ities for the employment of the people.   It is pleasing to note the progress   which is being made in some direc-  tions. Our woolen manufactures are   gaining credit for their excellence in   other communities as well as our own.  But we export considerable wool even  after all our factories are well sup-  plied. If this could be manufactured   at home, it would add greatly to the  wealth of our community, not only in  the profits which would accrue from the   use of machinery, but in the employ-  ment which it would furnish to many  of our citizens. Besides the manufac-  ture of woolen cloths, there is con-  siderable home-made hosiery of excel-  lent quality which is placed on the  market.    The range of articles which are   manufactured in this Territory is  gradually increasing; and from the  feeling which now prevails we judge  that many more branches will soon be  added to those already in operation.   The manufacture of soaps of various  grades has now become a settled and   paying business. A fine quality of hats  is also made. Boots and shoes and  clothing, glass, white lead, lead-  pipe, native paints, brushes,  paper, printing type, starch,  pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu-  factured in the Territory, and many o[f]   these articles in sufficient quantities   to supply the local demand and to ex-  port to some extent. It is an encour-  aging feature in the most of these en-  terprises that those engaged in them   are seeking to enlarge their facilities   with the view to increase their produc-  tion. We have a large number of   children growing up among us who   should be furnished with opportuni-  ties to acquire skill in mechanism,  manufactures, and other pursuit  which are necessary for the comfort   of man.  It is not only incumbent upon   parents to seek for avenues of prof-  itable employment for their children,   but it should be kept in view by the  leading men of the Church in all our  settlements. An idle man's brain, it   is said, is the devil's workshop, and   no community can prosper and main-  tain a high standard of morality that   does not furnish employment for its  members. Far better to work for low   wages than not to work at all. But  with proper care, and by putting in  use the experience that many individ-  uals in every settlement possess, there   need be no want of remunerative em-  ployment for the rising generation,  and for others who may come in from  abroad. It may not always be kept   in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per-  centage of idle persons in a commu-  nity is a direct loss to the whole.   It is unfortunate, also, for a   community, when the young   and enterprising are compelled  to leave it and go elsewhere to find   employment or room for the exercise    of the talent of which they feel them-  selves possessed. Settlements that   are in this situation will languish and  go to decay, while other that furnish   facilities for employment will become  thrifty and prosperous. The combi-  nation of capital by means of co-op-  eration would, in many instances, en-  able settlements to start branches of  manufacture and conduct them suc-  cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how-  ever, should not be encouraged, as  their failure destroys confidence and  makes it more difficult to obtain aid   for worthy enterprises which might be  made successful. Where co-opera-  tion has failed among us, it has not   been because the principle is defect-  ive, but because of mismanagement,   sometimes from ignorance and care-  lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from   selfishness.    Our country abounds in useful ele-  ments. We have a fertile soil, when   properly cultivated, and an admirable  climate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta-  bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can   be raised here, and as superior in  quality as can be found anywhere on   the earth. Care should be taken to  raise the very best varieties. Our  horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, as  well as our grains, and fruits, and  vegetables, should be of the very  best kinds, and no pains should be  spared to keep them pure. Our sys-  tem of irrigation does not admit   of the cultivation of large areas of   land. Our farms are moderate in ex-  tent. This being the case, they should  be cultivated in the most approved   style, and the whole business con-  nected with a farm should be con-  ducted in a manner to bring the best   results. As facilities for education  increase, there undoubtedly will be a  marked improvement in the manage-  ment of all these branches of busi-  ness.    PRACTICAL EDUCATION.  It is gratifying to notice the interest   hat is being taken among us in educa-  tion; yet there is great room for im-  provement. As the taste for what may   be called book-learning increases,   manual labor should not be neglected.   The education of the mind and the  education of the body should go hand  in hand. A skillful brain should be  joined with a skillful hand. Manual  labor should be dignified among us  and always be made honorable. The   tendency, which is too common in  these days, for young men to get a   smattering of education and then  think themselves unsuited for  mechanical or other laborious pur-  suits is one that should not be allowed   to grow among us. Of course it is   necessary as society is now organized,   that the professions, as they are  termed, should receive attention. But  every one should make it a matter of  pride to be a producer, and not a  consumer alone. Our children should   be taught to sustain themselves by   their own industry and skill, and not   only to do this, but to help sustain  others, and that to do this by honest  toil is one of the most honorable  means which God has furnished to his   children here on the earth. The sub-  ject of the proper education of the  youth of Zion is one of the greatest  importance.    President Brigham Young during his  lifetime established schools in Provo   and Logan, where the principles of the  Gospel have been taught in connection  with other branches of education, and  more recently similar schools have  been commenced, and conducted with  marked success; in Salt Lake, Beaver  and Fillmore Cities.    The good results arising from teach-  ings received in the Provo and Logan  Academies are very apparent and  pleasing to all who have the interests   of the young at heart, and we regret  that such institutions are so limited in  number.    Through the indefatigable labors of   Professors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew-  art and their associates, these schools  have done, and are now doing, a great   work in educational advancement, by   instilling a knowledge of the princi-  ples of the Gospel of life and salva-  tion into the minds of our children,  upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of   God must rest in the near future.    We trust it will not be long before  schools of this kind will be established   in every city and village where the   Latter-day Saints reside. In the   meantime, however, the Saints should  not fail to avail themselves of the   privileges that are now offered them in   the Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore,   and Salt Lake Academies.    THE "CHURCH SUITS."  Congress, at its last session as you are  aware, passed a law entitled "An  Act to amend an Act entitled an Act to   amend Section 5352 of the Revised   Statutes of the United States, in refer-  ence to bigamy, and for other pur-  poses," etc.    Under the 15th and 17th sections of   this law the Perpetual Emigrating   Fund Company and the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are  respectively declared dissolved, and   in this Act it is made the duty of the  Attorney General of the United States   to cause proceedings to be taken in the  Supreme Court of the Territory of  Utah to wind up the affairs of said as-  sociations.    Pursuant to the duty thus imposed  upon the Attorney General, on the 30th  day of July, 1887, proceedings were be-  gun in said court by the United States  against the Perpetual Emigrating Fund  Company and its trustees, and the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints and its alleged trustees for the  (Continued on Page 624.)

At half past 8 oclock in the evening the  Jailor came & unlocked the prison doors & I took  the parting hand with my Brother while he manifested  much Joy for my visit, well whose soul would  not be cheered to have a friend visit them while cast  into prison I left him in good spirits & bent my  way back again to the city of Boston while crossing  the long bridge I herd the cry of fire, the ringing of Bells,  the ratling of the engines, I soon beheld the flames begin  to lighten the city it was however extinguished in [[illegible  half an hour by the flood of water that was poured upon  it from the engines.

We again met the Sisters  who were the member[s] of the Church of Latter Day Joy  at the house of Sister Vose in Myrtle Street No 9 to  speak unto them the records of life.

 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12    (Continued from Page 617.)   purpose of disposing of the property of  the one and winding up the affairs of the  other: asking in these suits to escheat  to the United States large amounts   of property alleged to be held by these   two defendants. At the time of this  writing nothing has been done in these  cases further than to appear and an-  swer the complaints. What the result   of these cases will be, we, of course  cannot now say. It is proper, how-  ever, that we should speak upon this   important proceeding and let the   Saints know how the cases stand.    The Perpetual Emigrating Fund   Company, as all of you well know,  was conceived and organized for but   one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of   our people in their humble efforts to  gather with their brethren. It has   been for this charitable purpose, the   object of the generous bounty of the   Latter-day Saints, but at no time in  its history has it owned any real es-  tate, or any personal property, save  sufficient for its absolute needs each  succeeding year. The Church on the  other hand has been the owner of   property, the gifts and bequests of an   earnest, sincere people, made for the  purpose of aiding in the propagation  of the Gospel of our Savior  Jesus Christ. The effort now being  made by our government to dissolve  or wind up these associations and   escheat their property, is the first of   the kind in the history of our people,  and is believed to b[e] without histori-  cal precedent in this country. When  we say we shall watch these cases with   deep interest, the Saints will readily  believe that it is not alone for the   property involved in these suits, but   also for the principles and rights that   are at stake.    OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.  The intelligence which reaches us  from our settlements in Arizona is en-  couraging; and we note with pleasure   that the people of the settlements at  St. Johns and Woodruff have conquered  some of the difficulties with which  they had to contend, and which made  their position very trying. Indeed,   the news from all the Stakes there is  gratifying.    IN IDAHO.  In Idaho, though our people pay   taxes and support the schools, every-  one of our faith is denied the privilege  of acting in the capacity of a school  trustee or teacher, and no one with  our belief can take the test oath that   has been prescribed by the Legislature.   The situation of the people there is   one that excites great sympathy. They   are practically denied the rights of  American citizens through the infa-  mous test oath law which was enacted   by the Legislature. It is very trying   to their patience and bears heavily up-  on them. But the day must come   when they will be relieved from the  operation of this infamous law.    IN COLORADO.  In San Luis Valley, Colorado, the   efforts of our people to open and cul-  tivate farms, and to surround them-  selves with the necessaries and com-  forts of life, are meeting with gratify-  ing success. This is the more note-  worthy because of the fact that the  great bulk of settlers there have   moved from a warm climate and have  not had experience in battling with  the difficulties that have to be met in  the building up of new settlements in  an untried soil and climate. Like the  Saints in Wyoming, those who reside  in Colorado have always received fair  treatment and encouragement and  kind consideration from their neigh-  bors and the officials of the State.    IN MEXICO.  Our settlements in Mexico are pro-  gressing favorably and are gradually  being strengthened, both at Diaz and  Juarez. At the places named and in  the Sierra Madre Mountains near the  latter, we have nearly one hundred and  fifty thousand acres of grazing, timber  and agricultural lands.    The country is well adapted to stock-  raising, as the grasses are of good   quality and great variety, while the  climate is uniform, the temperature   seldom reaching higher than 80 degrees  or lower than an approach to the  freezing point. The facilities for  making comfortable homes there are  excellent, the land, water and timber   being good. A fine steam saw, shingle  and lath mill, and a planer and  molder, are in operation, affording  building material within easy reach of   Juarez.    The treatment of our people by the  national and state officials in Mexico   and her citizens generally, has been  cordial and hospitable. By word and  act they have encouraged colonization  in the Republic. The settlements in  Chihuahua afford abundance of room  for several hundred families and they   could live there in peace, and by ordin-  ary habits of industry would soon make   themselves prosperous and happy.    The Mexican Mission was opened in   1870, and the Church now has quite a  large following of native Saints, mainly  located in and about the national cap-  ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice of   Warning, and numerous pamphlets  have been published in the Spanish   language and are being distributed ac-  cording to ancient predictions. Thus   the truth is being spread abroad among   the seed of Israel through the means  of the record of their fathers, as well   as by the preaching of the Elders.    THE ALBERTA COLONY.  Recent letters from President Charles  O. Card, in charge of our colony in   Canada, contain information of a grati-  fying nature. The soil upon which  they are located is said to be very pro-  ductive, and the grain and vegetables   produced are of excellent quality, and  range for stock is abundant and nutri-  tious. The colony is preparing for   winter, and the families composing it   will soon have their houses completed.  They have opened a fine vein of coal   within three miles of their settlement,   which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.    The treatment accorded the Saints  there, by officials and people, has been   considerate and kind, and the pros-  pects for improvements and prosperity  are good. Brother Card would be glad   to have any of the Saints, contemplat-  ing a change of location, to join him,   in that land, and we will gladly ap-  prove efforts in that direction.    We may be led, hereafter, to call   some of the brethren to go there with   their families, to aid him in developing   the resources of that goodly land.    CONCLUSION  We cannot refrain from expressing  to you our own feelings of thankful-  ness that we live in such an age, and   that God has bestowed upon us His   Holy Priesthood and has permitted us  to take part in His great work. We   are thankful that we are associated   with this people called Latter-day   Saints; that we live in a day when  Prophets and Apostles have been raised   up in the Church of Christ; and that  God has stretched forth His hand to  fulfil His great and marvelous pur-  poses which have been predicted by  the mouths of the holy prophets since  the world began. We testify in the   name of our Lord and Master, Jesus,  that this is the great work of which  the prophets have spoken, that God is  the founder of it, and that it will stand   forever, and accomplish all that has  been predicted concerning it. Zion is  established and will be redeemed. And  it is our continual desire unto God that  His people may be faithful in keeping   His commandments and doing His  will, so that they may be accounted   worthy to stand, and their children  after them, and inherit the great bless-  ings which He has to bestow upon  the faithful. The day is not far dis-  tant when our Lord and Savior will be  revealed from the heavens, and we   should live in constant expectation of   this great event, and seek, with all the  energy and power that we can exercise  and obtain, to prepare ourselves, our  households, and, as far as we have in-  fluence, the inhabitants of the earth,   for His glorious appearing.

Brother David W. Rogers  dined with us. Brother Rogers was an inter-  esting man he had been a Methodist for  several years but had been looking  for greater things than that Church had.

 we supped with them & after supper I walked  again to the place of meeting & during this  walk I was in company with Priest Addison  Everett boarding at corner of Spring & Renw-  ick Street. This was truly an interesting Brother  my heart burned within me while walking  arm in arm through the city & [[town at feeling  a relation from this Brother & I felt to rejoice  that the city of New York was producing such  Saints. This Brother was of the literal desendant  of the tribe of Ephraim they had always [[light  the name of Ephraim in the family of all their  progenitors & down to the present day.  Brother Everett about one year ago had an   interview with 40 Lamanite chiefs in  this city they grasped his hand when he first entered  the room as though they were inspired to know  who he was. He gave them an account of the Book   of Mormon & of their forefathers & that the  Book of Mormon & the fulness of the gospel  would soon go to them they [[reading   it with the greatest degree of interest he  told them to receive it & teach their   tribes to do so when it comes which they  promised to do so & wished him to come  among them. We arived at the place of meeting  of the Saints which closed this interesting  subject. Elder O. Pratt preached a highly edefying  discourse to us from the 102 Psalm the Lord   should build up Zion & appear in his glor[y}  Willcox of Phelidelphia will v 2 - [[illegible

I will  spare none who remain in Babylon, but I will burne them up, saith   the Lord of hosts. As I the Lord have suffered, so will I put all Enemies  under my feet. For I the Lord utter my word, and it shall be obeyed.  And the Day of wrath & Indignation shall come upon the wicked out   No power shall stay my Hand And I say again woe unto that  Nations, or House, or people who seek to Hinder my people from obeying  the patriarchal Law of Abraham, which Leadeth to a celestial  Glory, which has been revealed unto my Saints through the mouth  of my servant Joseph, for whosoever doeth these things shall be damned  saith the Lord of Hosts, and shall be broken up and wasted away  from under Heaven by the judgments which I have sent forth and ^which^ shall  not return unto me void. And thus with the sword, and by Bloodshed  and with famine, and plagues, and earthquakes. And the Thunder of   Heaven, and the vivid lightnings shall this Nations and the Nations of the  Earth be made to feel the chastening hand of an Almighty God until   they are broken up, & destroyed, & washed away from under Heaven and  No power can stay my Hand. Therefore let the wicked tremble, Let them  that Blaspheme my name Hold their lips, for Destruction will swiftly overtake  them.
