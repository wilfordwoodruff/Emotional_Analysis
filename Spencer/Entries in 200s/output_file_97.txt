 We have been blessed with remarkably   fine weather the past Summer, & Crops  (Except wheat) has^ve^ been above an average,   & still ^the^ price of grain is raisising, caused  by the failure in England.

 I want to know now, if the brethren  can really and truly realize our true  position with regard to the Lamanites,  or do you consider them a poor, lost,   sunken race of beings that are not   worth saving? Do you ever read   the Book of Mormon? If you do,  do you believe and realize the  truth of its sayings, and also what  the Lord revealed to the Prophet   Joseph? These are things that  we have in our possession; we  have them in the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants and in the History of   Joseph Smith. Do you look them   over? If you do, and if you lay   them to heart as the things of God,   you will feel that it is actually our   duty to do all we possibly can  to benefit, enlighten and save this  dark and ignorant people. Do you  feel like killing off the Laman-  ites? I tell you there is no man  that will ever feel like killing   them if he possesses the Spirit  of the Lord. Well, says one,  "do you ever feel like chastising  them brother Brigham?" Yes, I do,  but I let the Spirit of the Holy  Gospel direct me; but until the  light of the Holy Gospel shone   upon me I felt like other men.   When the Priesthood was restored,  and the light of truth burst in   upon my mind, I knew then that  if it were not for the Israel-  ites the Gentiles might go to hell  and be damned. The Lord would  not take much pains with us any-  how, were it not for the pro-  mised seed. Instead of them being  inferior to us in birthright, they   are superior, and they stand first  in many instances, with regard to  the promises in particular. Well,   but says one, "how will you  prove this?" I will tell you,   if we had been of the house of Israel  and forsaken our God as much as we  have, and despised his ordinances  and trampled them under our feet, we   would have been cursed like these  Lamanites are, this is my proof. If  the Gentiles had been of the house of  Israel, legal heirs to the Priesthood,   and had received their oracles as the  house of Israel did, you would have   found that the same curse would have  come upon the Gentiles that you now   see upon these Lamanites, but inas-  much as they were not of the pro-  mised seed, to them the blessings  did not pertain, and they had no   part nor lot in them, only as they  were afterward granted on condition  of obedience. The Son of God came   through Israel, but we Gentiles being  strangers, and foreigners, and aliens,  in a national point, we had nothing   to do with putting Christ to death,  and hence the curse did not come  upon the Gentiles. When they are   restored, will they not stand before  the Gentiles? Will they not be   numbered with the Sons of God   and be adorned with the gifts  and graces of the Gospel, and stand   before the Gentiles? Yes, they  will! Now, what do the people  think? I should like to know   what this congregation think about it.    There are a good many brethren   and sisters here from Springville,  Palmyra, and Payson, what do   you all think about it? Had we   better drive them away out of the  country? Or, had we best take   hold and bring them into the   Gospel of Jesus Christ? Now, if  this people, male and female, feel  to school them, spend time and   pains to instil into their minds   correct principles, to divide land   with them, and clothe them, draw  their wood for them until they   learn to draw their own, and farm   for them until they learn to farm   for themselves, and if they will   no more slay them, no more seclude   them from their houses and hospi-  tality, and will go to work and  restore them to the knowledge of 
 We have labored upon this prin-  ciple for 50 years. You cast your  eyes and you see a tabernacle in  the desert; you see a city; and you  may travel for a thousand miles and  you will find this Territory filled   with cities, towns and villages. By  what power have these things been  accomplished? I came here on the  24th of July, 1847, with a little   handful of men as pioneers. What   did we find? A barren desert, as   barren as the desert Sahara. No   mark of the white man here. No  outward sign that a white man   could live here. How has this desert  been made to blossom as the rose?   Why this body of people from   almost every nation? I will tell  you. We carried the Gospel to   Europe, the Islands of the sea, and  the different nations of the earth;   we offered them the Gospel, and a  class of men and women—two of a  family, and sometimes a dozen of a  city—received our testimony, and  when we laid hands upon them   they received the Holy Ghost.   That Holy Ghost has remained with  them: it has instructed them and   inspired their hearts, and to-day   you see Utah as it is. If the Lord   Almighty had not backed up the  testimony of the Elders of Israel as  He has done, Utah to-day would have  been as when we found it 36 years  ago.    This is the condition of the Lat-  ter-day Saints. Joseph Smith   received these keys, this Priesthood,   this power, this Gospel by the ad-  ministration of angels from God,  and this testimony is true. He also  received a record called the Book of  Mormon, which is a record of the  ancient inhabitants of this continent.  That record is true; as also the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants, a  code of revelations given through   the Prophet Joseph Smith.   These revelations are true and  faithful, and they are being fulfilled   as fast as time will admit. I bear  my testimony of these things to the  world, for I know they are true.    I traveled thousands of miles with  Joseph Smith. I knew his spirit.  Many of the revelations given   through him have been fulfilled.  I myself wrote the revelation that   was given through him con-  cerning the war that would take  place in this country between the  north and south. That revelation   was published to the world for  twenty years before the war. It broke  out just as predicted, and I refer to   it because it is one of the revelations  that is fulfilled. To-day we are still   preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  The Lord Almighty has set His  hand to establish His Church and  kingdom on the earth, to build   up Zion in the mountains of   Israel.    Now with regard to the Priesthood.   We have been found fault with   sometimes because we profess to  have the Priesthood.  Let me say  to this congregation that our  Heavenly Father performs all His  works—the creation of worlds, the  redemption of worlds—by the power   of the Eternal Priesthood. And  no man on the earth, from the days  of Father Adam to the present  time, has ever had power to admin-  ister in any of the ordinances of life  and salvation only by the power of   the Holy Priesthood. You will find   this to be the case in the whole  history of the Prophets of God.  When Aaron was given the Priest-  hood he was called by revelation.   "No man taketh this honor unto  himself but he that is called of God  as was Aaron." Jesus Christ him-  self had to be called of God. He   was a High Priest. He left the  Priesthood on the earth with his 
 the truth the Lord God will bless  them, and they have nothing to   fear. If you will live up to this   you will rise, while those who do  not will go down. If this people will   observe this covenant, and follow   it one and all, (and here are the   leading men in these mountains be-  longing to several of the tribes, and   they feel well), thousands and hun-  dreds of thousands will embrace   this Gospel, and for ought I know  scores of thousands will become   members of this Church.    Now, if you will take hold of the  wheel and lift, it may be granted  unto us to accomplish this great   work, and I tell you that you will  receive the blessings of the Gospel,  such as you never received before, if  you will make up your minds to be   favourable and merciful unto them  in their filthiness, and in their   ignorance, these blessings are yours.  But if you get angry and kill   them, you will not obtain them.  Say to them, "if you steal and   destroy our property we will bear  with you, and while you are ignor-  ant we will bear with you," and   if this people will take this course  from this time forth, they will   feel the power of God more than   they ever did in these last days  before. (The congregation here  united in a loud "Amen.") And   you are finding it so, too.    Just give them what they want;  I tell you it is the cheapest way  to fight them. You can draw   them to you and make them bend  to anything if you use them well.   And if any man abuses them,   let him be dealt with by the   civil authorities, and in this way  you will succeed in the work you  have in view.    May God bless you all. Amen. 
 Apostles. They officiated in it until  they were put to death. It is by   that power that we administer in  this day and generation. The   Church and kingdom of God has  continued to grow from its first  organization. It is true we have  been called to pass through many  afflictions in our day and time.   Nevertheless, the Lord has preserved  His people, and they still live here  in the valleys of the mountains.    We have an anxiety to honor God  and keep His commandments, and  to honor our country and the Con-  stitution of our Government. That   Constitution we believe was given   by revelation, and whatever laws   are passed agreeable to it we desire  to honor. It guarantees to all men   the right to enjoy their religion, to  worship God according to the dictates  of their conscience.    "But," says one, "I would like to  know how many wives you have.  That is a matter you have  not said anything about." Well,  now, I will tell you a little anecdote  in connection with Sidney Rigdon.   The circumstance took place a great  many years ago, in Kirtland. A   young Elder just come in met Presi-  dent Rigdon on the street one day   in the vicinity of the Temple. Said   the young man: "President Rigdon,  will you please tell me the meaning  of the horns of the beast John saw?"  President Rigdon, drawing himself   up, looked at the young man, and   replied: "My dear brother, there is  a great deal between you and the   beast that John saw," and walked   away. Well, I sometimes think it  is so with this generation. There is  a great deal between the people of  this generation and the plurality of  wives. There are a great many   principles that God has revealed in  these last days that it is necessary   for us to understand before we come  to that principle. But as I have   brought the subject up I will say a  few words upon it. The Lord has  revealed to us that no kingdom, no   king, no prince, no president, no   ordinance of marriage, no ordinance  performed by any man from the  days of father Adam, will have any   power or force after death, except   those ordinances are performed by  men holding the Eternal Priesthood.  Is there a king, is there a prince, is  there a queen,—will either when  they pass the other side of the veil,  find a throne there? Would the  Czar of Russia, who was assassinated  by the hands of the ungodly not  long ago, when he went into the   Spirit world find a throne there?  No. Why? Because the kingdom   of the Czar of Russia belonged to  time. When he went into the   Spirit world that was the end of his  kingdom and power. His kingdom   had not been sealed upon his head  by any man having the power and   authority of the Eternal Priesthood.   So in regard to all kingdoms and  thrones. You may take Her Majesty  Queen Victoria—who has reigned   a long time, and who is perhaps as  good a sovereign as has reigned since  the days of William the Conqueror.  When she passes behind the veil she  will find her kingdom at an end,   because it was not sealed upon her  head for time and eternity by any   man having the authority of the   Holy Priesthood. So I will say to   our friends here—the strangers  within our gates—that  any man that  marries a wife by any other authority   than the authority of the Holy   Priesthood is simply married for  time, "or until death do you part."   When you go into the Spirit world  you have no claim on your wife and  children. The ordinance of having   them sealed to you by one having   the authority of the Holy Priest- 
 hood must be attended to in this  world. Father Abraham obeyed  the law of the patriarchal order of  marriage. His wives were sealed to  him for time and all eternity, and  so were the wives of all the Patri-  archs and Prophets that obeyed that  law.    I desire to testify as an individual  and as a Latter-day Saint that I  know that God has revealed this law  unto this people. I know that if we  had not obeyed that law we should  have been damned; the judgments  of God would have rested upon us;  the kingdom of God would have   stopped right where we were when  God revealed that law unto us.  Why have we obeyed it? I obeyed  it because I want my wife or wives  with me after death; I want my   wives and children with me in the  morning of the resurrection; I want  my wives and children organized in  the family organization, that I may   dwell with them and they with me,   throughout all eternity, as well as   with Father Abraham and other   men who honored and obeyed that  law. This is the position we occupy.  We have obeyed the law because  God has commanded us, and I bear  record of its truth; and so far as I  am concerned, if I can have my  wives and children with me in the  morning of the resurrection, so that   I can dwell with them and with   those Patriarchs and Prophets who   obeyed that law, it will amply repay  me for the trials and tribulations I   may have had to pass through in   the course of my life here up on the  earth. Many men suppose that we   have obeyed that law to gratify the  lusts of the flesh. Bless your soul,   if that had been our object, we   might have followed the example  of the people of the Christian world  —committed whoredom and adul-  tery—without bringing upon our-  selves the cares, pains, and penalties  that we have to bear by obeying this   law. But let me tell you that the  Latter-day Saints look upon adultery  as one of the greatest crimes any  man can commit in this world. It  is next to murder. No, this people  have not obeyed that law because  of a desire to gratify the lusts of the  flesh; they have observed it in obedi-  ence to the command of God, and   because it will have power and effect  after death.    I pray God to pour out His Holy   Spirit upon us, that our ears may   be open to hear and our hearts to  understand the things of the king-  dom of God, which is my prayer in  the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF    Spoke. Our religion is God-given, and  were we to relinquish it because of the  fear of man, we would be recreant to  every heaven-born principle. Civil  and religious liberty is the keystone in  the arch of the glorious Constitution  of our country; if that be taken away  the whole fabric must fall to pieces.  This Government is in the hands of  God. My life is of but small conse-  quence when compared with my hopes  of eternal happiness. No power will  put down this work for God is at the  helm and will guide it safely through.    President Young has done and is doing   all in his power to benefit mankind,  thus following in the footsteps of the  prophet Joseph. I pray that we may  be faithful to the holy principles we  have received. Amen.

 Rochester Sangamon County Illinois Dec 19th 1838    Eunice Woodruff    My Dear Sister    Although I am in the midst of a  croud & but a few moments allotted me to write yet I feel it my Duty to appropriate  these few moments in communicating a few words to you & my Dear parents.  I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writing  on the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I found  among his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy of  writings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxious  to put in your possesion all writings that you have sent him or that he has  directed to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death has  closed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feel  it my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness  & Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I also  feel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit  & I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much upon  my mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t]  omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent items  Firstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 rom  [Septe] & [Azubah] & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson in fine I have  in my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well as  his own compositions. I took them because I suppose that I should be able  to put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they   could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would   ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Harte.  I shall give you  information upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not had  time as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there is  among them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents &   Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo-  sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of his  clerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness & death & I learn  the following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect-  able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted    [upside-down text]Wilford Woodruff to  Eunice Woodruff  givi[g]the Acco[un]t of the death  of Ashael Woodruff[end of upside-down text]

I would inform you that I  recieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that she  took two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other   from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was   glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word had  the desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like to  be with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up a  Church, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent among  you to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I am  doing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland on  board the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100  miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok   Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the first  house & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8  oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island.  they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in the  centre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the  Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon  to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to  the people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into  the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressed  the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first  time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea,  to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for  preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800  inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this  Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the  first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear.  The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us  & would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great & the people so much  in our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us

 I have had a great desire to visit my parents & the rest of my  relatives in the Eastern States & I thought I should have  seen ^them^ ere this but there has been more & more resting upon  me from the time I first commenced labouring here of the  the Church is in its infancy & their has been but vary  few labourers in this south country. But we expect several  Elders from the East will join us here vary soon which may take  some of the burdan or assist in bearing it. I yet expect if I  live to visit my friends in the East & that before long for I can  assure them all that I have a great desire to see them And  also desire their salvation both temporally & spiritual &  that they may be saved in these last Days with the fulness  of the Gentiles & the house of Israel that they may esscape the just  judgments of God which awate the world for he who sits in the heavens  & beareth the sword beareth it not in vain for it will soon  fall upon Idumea or the world & the voice of God to his Saints  is come out of her Only people I have expected that some of our  travling Brethren would visit your region of country so that  you might hear some preaching from them if it H[ad]  been the case I hope it soon may be I learn from the M&Ad  the paper that the twelve have visited the New England states  the extent of their success I have not yet learned But ex^s^pect  to soon The little stone cut out of the Mountain without hands is  rolling fourth & will continue to roll untill it Becomes A mountain  & fills the whole Earth The Church is beginning to travel out of  the wilderness & the signs follow the believer Even in this South  country the sick are healed many of the Saints speak in Tongues  others interpet which gifts come from God well says one these  are strange things as strange as they are ^they are^ the gifts that Christ  said should follow the believers. It is true the Latter Day Saints  have all manner of Evil spake against them The cry of Jo Smith, Mormonites  fals prophet fals Teachers wolfs in sheeps Clothings & Murrels clan &c  &c but they that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution  but how can any Tree be judged ownly by its fruit the truth is this  generation is nearly ripe & I believe God will soon aris from his Habitation  & rebuke the Nations & shake not ownly the Earth but also heaven 
 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him.  Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things &  & calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of the  sea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. On  Sunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from different  Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady came  foreward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Hale  lead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islands  of the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min-  istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the same  place from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closed  another sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a   young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I lead  them forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & lade  hands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesday  following three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto them  by Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath not  sent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step into  the waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come &  preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet-  ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles   long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodist  church, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tide  mills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.    The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitable  to strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. North  Island is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro-  ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are now  in the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but are  now mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office &  store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.    South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think as  any think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal  mass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for the  coves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is  supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small parts  of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and   spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same  manner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply  greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their is  many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel,  stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin  Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers,  Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,   Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on the  shore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that we  wished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertile  than these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes  20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more

I wrote Ashel a Letter which he received just before his Death in  which my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to any  person other in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him I  write a letter to him afterwords but it did not arrive untill after his death There was  three Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I write my  Brothers grave I felt solumn while recieving it poor man he had not a relative to attend  on his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from his  grave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articles  of his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his  [finance] account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles  & pencils & penknife & c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerning  those things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter I  am sensible that Ashels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a beloved  Son & Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My Deer  Sister since Ashel is gone it has given me great consolation to meditate upon  its cause. you have persued continue faithful[ness] in the cause in which you are  engaged & you will receive a crown of life!  O that I can but meet my Sister  in the celstral glory the taught of it will sweeten my tri[a]ls on Earth. Do not  think that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbid  it is true a number of our worthy brethern have sealed testimony with their Blood  of late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready & willing to share the  same fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called to  feel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so & my work is Done I say amen, I am  ready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me you  shall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I am  travling through the cold of winter with a wife & child which is severe at this time but I  endure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River beca[u]se  of there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me your  prayers Deer parents & Sister while Ashel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated to  live or Die for Christ.

 Where is the religion, principle, Holiness, gifts, graces, fruits, Gospel, Faith  Church & its affects to to be found in this generation that was with   the Ancients well says one their is no need of them Now, has God  or his gospel changed certainly not & the same causes will produce  the same affect to day as Anciently The Apostle exhorts us to contend  for that faith once delivered to the Saints wher is the honest Searcher after  truth that cannot see what the faith of the Saints was it was by faith  that that the worlds were framed [FIGURE] God spake Chaos heard & worlds came into  order by reason of the faith there was in him. So with man also—he spake by faith  in the name of God, and the sun stood still, the moon ob[eyed], mountains [r]emoved, prisons  fell, lions mouths were closed, the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence, armies  their power, the sword its terror, and death its dominion, and all this by reason  of the faith which was in them.

If the Roman church is the mother of harlots is not her  daughters visible & if the fountain is corrupt are not the streams also  I look upon this generation of Gentiles as a Body as standing in  the same situation with regard ^to^ the Second Comeing of Christ as  the Jews were at his first & that day of calamity which is at the  door will surely overtake them as a theiief in the night & their unbelieving  the word of God will not make the truth of it without affect The signs are  puting fourth of the second advent of Christ the Church is travling out  of the wilderness the standard is erecting to it we some of the Gentiles  are seeking the treese are puting fourth leaves the stone rolls the Kingdom  grows & will soon fill the Earth & God will bring to pass his act his strange  act the walls of Zion will be reared in beauty & glory the Lamanites  will blossom as the rose the whole house of Israel will be gathered the Tabernacle  of God will dwell with men.

 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyard    I remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priest  became alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing  & made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went out  to hear him. He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principles  I wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expect  to meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so I  arose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation.  The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several priests  to come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surely  fall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O ye  priests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his people  The stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and  with them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lord  of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdom  on the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel of  JESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands has  already entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormon  has this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade in  ships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weapon  formed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it is fighting  against God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself]  & the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.    My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of my  meditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been   & whareere I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn]  myself. A few years since, I was tending mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn]  to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn]  the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn]  Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [the] [s]eventy Apostles to [page torn]  from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these last  days in rending the Kingdom of darkness, and [illegible word] with everlasting truth. It has called me to  visit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, and  are now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instruction  at my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I am  sapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the sea  spread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid these  truths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, Illiterate  Willford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this,  but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak things  of this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ    I cannot tell when I shall see any of you again, their was some invisidble power seemed to  hurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached these  Islands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of the  Islands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilege  to visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have great  faith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my   Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath   done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to my  soul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expect  to spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000  inhabitants, and there is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friends  may still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also  ^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring friends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. Dear  Parents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. Elder  Hale & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of God may abide with you & that  your lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the Prayer of your Dutiful son   Willford Woodruff

 Revelation given to Joseph Smith  January 19th 1841:    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:1-6|1## Verily thus saith the Lord, unto you my servant Joseph Smith,  I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments which  you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I might  shew forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth.  Your prayers are acceptable before me, and in answer to them,  I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to make  a solemn proclamation of my gospel and of this stake which  I have planted to be a corner stone of Zion, which shall be  polished with that refinement which is after the similitude of  a palace. This proclamation shall be made to all the kings  of the world to the four corners thereof—To the honorable president  elect, and the high minded governors of the nation in which you live  and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad. Let it be  written in the spirit of meekness, and by the power of the Holy  Ghost which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the  same; for it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my  will concerning those kings and authorities, even what shall befall  them in a time to come. For, behold! I am about to call upon  them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the set  time has come to favor her.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:7-10|2## Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation and  with your testimony, fearing them not, for they are as grass,  and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth,  that they may be left also without excuse, and that I  may visit them in the day of visitation, when I shall  unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of  the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing  of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony  which I have revealed unto them. And, again I will  visit and soften their hearts, many of them, for your good,  that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to  the light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting  up of Zion. For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, in  an hour when ye think not of, and where shall be the safety

 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF    took the stand, expressing his satis-  faction with the fair showing of the  Associations as manifested by the   morning's report. There was some-  thing he had on his mind, to present  to the congregation. First he re-  ferred to the Prophet Joseph who  had been raised up to lay the founda-  tion of this great Church and King-  dom, through the revelations of the   Lord. The speaker gave a rapid   outline of the many glorious mani-  festations received by the Prophet   Joseph, from time to time. All the   glories and exultations ever granted   to man were bestowed upon him.    The 109th section of the Doctrine  and Covenants was then read, con-  taining the great visions received by  Joseph and the Twelve at the occa-  sion of the dedication of the Temple  at Nauvoo. These visions are the  testimony of Joseph Smith having  received the keys of the Kingdom.  In the winter of 1838 to [18]39 Joseph   Smith called the Twelve together in  the city of Nauvoo, giving to them   their endowments as Apostles. El-  der Woodruff here bore a strong tes-  timony to the truth of these endow-  ments having been given by Joseph   to the Apostles. The Prophet taught   the Twelve many things pertaining   to the priesthood and revealed to  them their duties, rejoicing greatly  in being privileged to confer the keys  and powers of the holy priesthood   upon other men to remain on earth  forever and ever. The Prophet also   told the Twelve that he would not  live to see the Temple built, but   they would, and it was now their   duty to bear off the Kingdom. The   room where Joseph was talking of   the things of God was full with holy   influences. The responsbility rest-  ing upon the Twelve is not to be  thrown off; neither can any member  of the priesthood refuse to bear off   the Kingdom, or they will come un-  der condemnation. He had no am-  bition, but the desire to do his duty   towards the Kingdom of God, and   the longer he lived and had the vis-  ion of his mind open to him, the   less he cared for the things and   wealth of this world. It was his  duty, as a father in Israel to counsel  the people, since the Prophet and   many of the original Twelve have  gone beyond. Seeing the fast ap-  proach of departure from this stage  of action, it was his duty to improve   his time and counsel the people with  all the wisdom imparted by the spir-  it of the Lord. The speaker then  gave some valuable counsel to the   young with regard to the libraries  they intended starting, warning   them against the pernicious reading  of novels and advising them to get   books of valuable information where-  with to store their minds, such as   historical works, descriptions of   travels in foreign countries and simi-  lar instructive publications.    Through the reading of history,   the young will learn of the marvel-  ous and righteous dealing of God  with the various nations of the world  in ancient times and modern. This   the speaker illustrated very interest-  ing by the Persian King Cyrus who  was prospered in all undertakings,  for his virtue, temperance, mercy   and justice. History all through the  long ages teaches us that whenever   a people turned from righteousness  unto wickedness, it was visited with  the chastisements of the Almighty  who would always find somebody   to execute His decrees. Thus the   Jews under Zedekiah were destroy-  ed or led into captivity by the Baby-  lonian King, [##2 Kings 25:1-9##] and afterwards Baby-  lon was destroyed and subjugated   by Cyrus, whom the Lord had raised  up to fulfill His purposes. [##2 Chronicles 36:22-23##]    The speaker recommended the  Histories of Rollin and Josephus as   valuable reading matter, proving the  fulfillment of the prophecies of the   servants of God, as instanced so   prominently by Josephus' record of  the destruction of Jerusalem under  the Roman Emperor Titus. These   works give true history, imparting   valuable knowledge, and they ought  to be in the libraries of the young  and old. With the history of these   ancient nations and their successive   overthrow and downfall we ought to  realize the importance of our own  position. We are stepping on to the  platform of the millennium; ap-  proaching the world's great crisis.  What we have before us should stim-  ulate the young to activity and vig-  lance in bearing off the Kingdom.    It is only the Latter-day Saints who  are expected of God to do His will  and work. Zion never shall be over-  thrown, the world may vex and dis-  tress us but they cannot overthrow   us, or the Church and Kingdom of   God. No people ever held such a  position as do the young people of   this Church. Therefore the speak-  er takes such a transcendent inter-  est in the welfare of themselves and  their institutions. It is by the in-  spiration of God that Joseph Smith   and the Twelve have borne the testi-  mony of the Gospel to all the world.   The sons now rising up will have  the burden of the Kingdom on their   shoulders and their situation will,  in a sense, be different from that of  their fathers. Storms and wars will   then stir up destruction all around,   but they will be preserved even un-  til the coming of Christ. The young   were exhorted to go before the Lord  in prayerful humility and they would  receive His spirit and a testimony of  the truth of the gospel. This is a   Kingdom that is destined to triumph   and stand. The signs of the times  are plainly indicating the rear ap-  proach of the Lord. Our own na-  tion is turning against us in hatred   and with persecution, although the   constituton is as broad and wide as   the universe. The corruption,   wickedness and abomination of the   world are calling down the judgments   of the Almighty, now as they ever   did in former ages. The speaker   can plainly see the things awaiting  both Zion and Babylon, for God is a   just judge who metes out rewards   and punishments to all impartially.    Elder Woodruff then addressed a  powerful exhortation to the young,   to put on the armor of the gospel,  avoiding all sin and striving after   virtue, and to the older Saints to   attend to their progress in faith and  sincerity. We have wants and op-  presions known to the Lord, for He   will fight our battles, causing the   wicked to slay the wicked. Let all   the house of Israel hear the word of  the Lord, for all the prophecies and   promises of the Lord will surely be   fulfilled. The edifying discourse   was brought to an end with a fervent   prayer for the blessings of God to   rest upon all Israel. 
 [upside-down text] Feb 12—Sister, Benbow has just called says Little Willie is quite well & hearty, grows  finely, lear[n]s fast, is perfectly contented, often speaks of his parents, takes good care   of their things—&c &c &c— W Richards    Nauvoo February 11th 1845    Elder Willford Woodruff,   Dear Brother,    I improve the opportunity of sending   a few lines by a brother who starts for England tomorrow,  after some of his friends.    It will rejoice your heart to hear, that we have a remark-  ably mild winter, clear and pleasant, and peace in the   city; as it does ours to live here and enjoy it. Though the papers  report a total repeal of the Nauvoo charter, by a large   majority in both houses, we remain undisturbed, and city   affairs go on as usual. We expect to appeal to the U. S. Court    Such being the repudiation of  ^towards her^ our own citizens. Who will  pay foreign loans when due? Illinois is now borrowing   some millions in London.    Little Willie was well, quite recently we heard. Bro   Hedlock's family are well. I would like to have Bro Hedlock   tarry in England till fall, then come and get his Endowment   then perhaps take his family and return, or go Noe where.  Sister Hedlock received her box, (sent by Benson,) thankfully.    Not one of the Quorum received any letter from Bro Hedlock  through Benson, or the ship.    The Stone is nearly hewed for the Temple. A new stone   font. is about to be eraected. The wood woodwork of the house   is progessing rapidly, in a tier of shops, under a temporary   roof, oin the basement story^first floor^, and we hope to commence the   endowment next fall, or early in the winter.    We will probably send out a few elders to England  in the spring, but not many until after the endowment    I wish you to attend to the Book money and other 
 President Wilford Woodruff was   then called upon to address the   Saints and in substance was as  follows: "Our Father, who art in  Heaven, hallowed by thy name,   Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be   done on earth as it is in heaven."    The sectarian world commence   their prayers in that manner. They  do not realize what they are saying    While on the other hand the saints   of God fully realize the importance  of this prayer. It is a certain con-  solation to every son and daughter  of God to know that their Father  in Heaven is ready and willing to   answer the prayers that are offered   up to him in humbleness. I know   that the God of Heavens lives. That   the priesthood which he has given   to us is true, and I know that the   spirit of God is with this people.  He will be with us at all times if   we do that which is right in the   sight of God. He related the time   when he first heard the gospel of   Christ. How one night he came   home after a hard day's toil from  the shores of Lake Ontario. The   night was wet and chilly, and as  he got inside the door of his home  how he was told that two Mormon   elders had been to his house and  had left word that they would hold   a meeting that night. He went to   that meeting and there he heard  the gospel for the first time. He   felt a new hope and he had a   desire to know more of that gospel.    He bought a book of Mormon and   sat up all night to read it. The   next day he went and asked to be   baptized, and he and his brother   were baptized into the church of   God. I have grown up with that   gospel which I heard on that   stormy night in 1833.    We are engaged in a glorious work   and ought not to trouble ourselves   about the affairs of this world. He   hoped, however, that they would look   after the things of God instead of work-  ing too much for the things of the   world. I want the young men who are  in the Sabbath schools to grow up pro-  perly. Many of the young men are   given to smoking, drinking, which is not   right in the sight of God. Do not be   discouraged with regard to your relig-  ion. Your religion is true and you will  find it all right. He related an inci-  dent of the power and spirit of God   while he was traveling in Staffordshire  during the early days of the church in   England. Whilst in the Potteries he   had been speaking nearly every night,  and moreover he was booked to speak   for some time to come. The next night   however, the spirit of God told him   that that would be the last time he   would speek in those parts for some  time to come. He thereupon asked  the Lord to reveal to him what He   wished him to do. He was told to go   to a place about eighty miles distant.   He did not ask any questions but went  as commanded. Arriving there he   found a great many people who were   ready to receive the gospel. He bap-  tised about two thousand people before  he left for other parts. Also showed  to the saints that he was called upon  to visit the Fox islands and there also   he found many who were desirous to   give obedience to the principles of the   most holy faith. Spoke of the endow-  ments he had received under the   Prophet Joseph. Also of how he had   been through the persecutions at Kirt-  land and other places.    The saints of God will be safe when  the judgements are being poured out  over the face of the earth. That the   Son of God will come in the clouds of  heaven and dwell with the saints for a  thousand years on the earth. Look at   these things as they are. No man had   the authority since the church dwin-  dled into unbelief till the power was   given to the Prophet Joseph Smith.    The gospel of life and salvation was to   both Jew and Gentile. No matter how   long I live, whether I tarry for only a   while or not the gospel of Christ will   go on and fulfil its destiny. God bless   you. Amen. 
 [Image]  PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    An address of welcome was then  made by President Woodruff. He  spoke as follows:    I feel highly honored this morning  in meeting with so many of my friends  upon this important occasion. Yester-  day those who were present might  have observed my condition. I was  perfectly overwhelmed in consequence  of the scene before me. It was not  what was said particularly, but it   brought to my mind in overwhelming  power my boyhood and early  manhood and my desires that  I might live upon the earth to find a  people who would receive the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ as taught by Christ  and the Apostles. In meeting with  thousands of the children of the   Latter-day Saints, it brought to my  mind those scenes and the fulfillment  of my prayers and desires before the  Lord.    I hope this morning I may be able   to make a few remarks. I will say  this, it has been a desire of my life,  from my boyhood up, never to ad-  dress any assembly of people whom I  could not make hear what I had to say.  I feel the same this morning; I do not  know whether I can make this as-  sembly hear me or not; but I will do  the best I can.    As I can hardly expect to ever  have the opportunity of addressing  the people of this State and my  friends in days to come I  have a few reflections upon  my mind that I wish to lay before you.  And I will say they are different from  any of my public speeches that I have  been in the habit of presenting to the  people. I have consulted no man with  regard to the course I should pursue in  my remarks here this morning, and I  do not know that I shall satisfy my  friends in the remarks that I may   make.    First, I want to say a few words  upon politics. I hope that will not  astonish you. I have not been in the  habit of this heretofore. But I feel  desirous to say a few things that are  upon my mind. In the first place,  there is not one item, not one sentence  in the Constitution of the United  States, nor in the laws of the United  States, or of the State of Utah, that de-  prives any citizen, of any name,  nature, religion or politics in the land,  from joining any political party he   wishes or voting for whomsoever he  wishes. This is the right of every  man without hindrance. We   have been accused at times   of using Church influence to  guide and direct the State. This is   occasionally presented to the public as  our action. I feel it my right and duty   to say here today that I was acquainted  with Joseph Smith and associated  with him from 1833 until his martyr-  dom. I have been acquainted with  Brigham Young and associated with  him for forty years of my life, at home   and abroad, under many circum-  stances. I have also been acquainted  with John Taylor and labored with   him in every capacity in which he was  called to act. I have also been a mem-  ber of the quorum of the Twelve Apos-  tles for upwards of fifty-six years of   my life. And I have been presiding   over the Church itself for a few years.   I have been associated with my coun-  selors and with the present Twelve   Apostles. And I want to say upon this  occasion, before God, angels and all   men that are before me, that I never for  one instance have ever known any  leader of this Church ever attempt   to dictate and direct the affairs   of the State as member of the   Church. At the same time, when  any man, no matter who he is—Mor-  mon, Jew or Gentile—goes forth and   uses money or any means to hire men  to vote for him, I think he steps out-  side of his right, and stands in a   measure responsible.    I want to say so much to my friends   this morning. I have officiated for   twenty sessions in the Legislative   Council of the Territory of Utah, and  one session as a member of the House,   and it never cost me one farthing for  any office I ever held in the Church   or in the State or Territory. And I   never asked any mortal man on the   face of the earth to cast a vote for me  that I have any recollection of. As an   ensample, perhaps I may be permitted  to say, I am the father of fourteen sons   and have a number of sons-in-law, and  I believe they are pretty nearly evenly   divided on political party lines—Demo-  crats and Republicans. I will give   any man five dollars if in con-  versing with them he can get any one  of them to say that his father   ever told him who to vote for. Some   of you may try to make a little money  perhaps at that. (laughter) I con-  sider everybody is responsible for him-  self, and he has a right to vote for   whom he pleases.    Again, I never asked any office at   the hands of any being in heaven or   on earth, not even of my heavenly   Father, except upon on instance,   which I will relate here. In my boy-  hood, as you have heard me testify, I   went to the Sabbath schools. I read   the New Testament. I saw the doc-  trine there portrayed in plainness, as  taught by Jesus Christ and His Apos-  tles, and it was a glorious doctrine. I

I therefore say unto you, I seal upon  his head the office of a bishoprick, like unto my servant Edward  Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations of mine house,  that he may receive the consecrations of mine house, that he  may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my  people saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George,  for he shall honor me.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:22-24|9## Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman, and my  servant John Snider, and others, build a house unto my  name, such an one, as my servant Joseph shall show unto  them, upon the place which he shall show unto them also.  And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that  strangers may come from afar to lodge therein: therefore,  let it be a good house, worthy of all acceptation, that the weary  traveller, may find health and safety, while he shall contemplate  the word of the Lord, and the corner stone I have appointed for  Zion. This house shall be a healthy habitation, if it be built  unto my name, and if the governor which shall be appointed  unto it, shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it. It shall  be holy, or the Lord your God will not dwell therein.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:25-31|10## And again, verily I say unto you, let all my saints from afar;  and send ye swift messengers yea chosen messengers, and say unto  them, come ye with all your gold, and your silver, and your precious  stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all ^who have^ knowledge  of antiquities, that will come may come, and bring the box tree  and the fir tree, and the pine tree, together with all the precious  trees of the earth, and with iron, with copper, and with brass,  and with zinc, and with all your precious things of the earth,  and build a house to my name, for the Most High to dwell therein,  for there is not place found on earth, that he may come and restore  again that which was lost unto you, or, which he hath taken away,  even the fulness of the priesthood; for a baptismal font there  is not upon the earth; that they, my saints, may be baptized for  those who are dead; for this ordinance belongeth to my house,  and cannot be acceptable to me only in the days of your  poverty, wherein ye are not able to able to build a house

I received a good letter from Bro Chonder, Miller, of Manchester  a few days ago, since, but have not time to answer it at   present.    The Saints are more engaged than ever to finish the   Temple, and it is very desirable that tithings be   forwarded from all branches at the earliest safe conveyance    Many of the citizens of Hancock County are wishing   to sell out, and the faces of many saints are turned   hitherward    Elder P. P. Pratt is in N. York, and has the superintendence   of all the churches in the East, as he has probably told  you. All things are going well in that quarter.    Rigdonism is about dead. it scarcly lived, and   would not have lived at all if the elders had let it alone.    Law is preaching about the country that they must remove  the Mormons before they finish their Temple, "if they dont   all hell cant move them." So says report.    The different Quorums are becoming perfected in their several   orgenizations, by which means the elders are leaving their   places.

 [IMAGE]   MRS. EMMA WOODRUFF.    had a great desire to live on the earth  until I could see inspired men who   could teach me those principles that I  read of in the New Testament. I   prayed a great deal in my boyhood   and my early manhood that I might  live on the earth to receive   those principles that I there   read of in the New Testament. In  1833, for the first time in my life,  I saw an Elder in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints. That was   Zera Pulsipher. He told me that he  was inspired of the Lord. He was   threshing grain in his barn when the   voice of the Lord came to him and   told him to arise and go to the north,  the Lord had business for him there.   He called upon Brother Cheney, his  neighbor and a member of the Church.   They traveled sixty miles on foot, in   February, in deep snow, and the first  place they felt impressed to call upon  was the house of my brother and my-  self. They went into the house and  talked with my brother's wife, and  they told her who they were and what   their business was. They told her   that they were moved upon to go to  the north, and they never felt im-  pressed to stop anywhere until they  came to that house. When they told  her their principles, she said her hus-  band and her brother-in-law both were  men who believed those principles, and  they had prayed for them for years.  They appointed a meeting in the   schoolhouse upon our farm. I came  home in the evening, and my sister-  in-law told me of this meeting. I had  been drawing logs from the shores of   Lake Ontario (I was in the lumber   business), and I turned out my horses,  did not stop to eat anything, and went   to the meeting. I found the house and   the dooryard filled with people. I   listened for the first time in my life to  a Gospel sermon as taught by the   Elders of this Church. It was what I  had sought for from my boyhood up.  I invited the men home with me. I  borrowed the Book of Mormon, and   sat up all that night and read. In the   morning I told Brother Pulsipher I   wanted to be baptized. I had a   testimony for myself that those princi-  ples were true. Myself and my  brother, as was stated here yesterday,  went forth and were baptized—the two  first in that county. That was the   beginning of my connection with the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints.    At this point I will say, upon the   subject of religion, what are the   rights of men upon religious subjects?   I do not know that I can do better   than to quote Brother Joseph Smith's  remarks before thousands of people at   a conference in Nauvoo, when there  were many non-Mormons present. He  said, "If I were the emperor of the   world and I had power to control the   whole human family, I would sustain  every man, woman and child in the   enjoyment of their religion." Those   are my sentiments today. I believe   every man—Jew, Catholic, Protestant,  or anything—has a right to enjoy his   religion unmolested. I believe the   Constitution of the United States and  the laws of the United States guaran-  tee this blessing and privilege to every-  body. In fact, I believe that even   Robert Ingersoll and his followers have   a right to their opinions and to enjoy   the same; they have a right to their  views with regard to God, to Christ, to  the heavens and earth, to the  present and the future. Still I  will say, I believe that when   Robert Ingersoll goes into the  spirit world he will find the Bible  is not a novel. He will learn that   there if never before. He will learn   that the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus   Christ and the sacrifice He made is  not a burlesque, but that that was done   for the salvation of the world. And   he will find that there will be a God  there, there will be a heaven there,   there will be a hell there, there will  be everything there of which the  Bible has spoken concerning it.    In the spring after I was baptized,  I went to Kirtland. There I met  with the Prophet Joseph Smith and   his brother Hyrum. I met those men  that afterwards formed the quorum of  the Twelve Apostles. I traveled with   Joseph Smith and with that company  of men—205 of them—one thousand   miles to the Missouri to assist our   brethren in their difficulties. They   had been driven from their homes and their lands, from Jackson  County into Clay County. We   traveled a thousand miles together.   There I had my first experience of the  dealings of God with the Prophet of   God. I understood perfectly well that  he was a prophet. I read the vision,   I read his revelations, and I knew   they could not come from any man on   the face of the earth only by the in-  spiration of Almighty God. From   Missouri I commenced my mission  under Bishop Partridge. In other  words, I will say that while there I  had a great desire to preach the   Gospel. I had that desire from my  boyhood up. I had been a miller, and  I had walked my mill hours and hours  in the night, with my soul filled with   these desires to preach the Gospel to   the children of men. At the time I   speak of I was a Teacher, and had no  power and authority to go forth and   preach. I went one Sunday into the  forest there in Clay county. I was   living with Lyman Wight, with half  a dozen of the signers of the Book of  Mormon—the Cowderys, the Whit-  mers, Judge Higbee, etc. I went  off by myself and prayed to the  Lord that I might have the   privilege of preaching the Gospel to  my fellowmen. That is all the office  that I ever asked of the Lord or any-  body else, as far as that is concerned.  While praying the Lord gave me His   spirit and answered me that my   prayers were heard and would be   answered upon my head, and that that  I had asked for should be given me. I  walked two or three hundred yards out  of the forest into an open—a broad   highway—in the midst of the forest,  and there I saw Judge Higbee stand-  ing in the middle of the road with his  arms folded. I walked up to him, and   when I got to him he says, "Wilford,   the Lord has revealed to me that it is  your duty to be ordained to go and  preach the Gospel." I said, "Is that  so?" He said, "Yes." "Well," says   I, "if the Lord wants me to preach  the Gospel I am ready to go and do it to   the best of my ability." I did not tell   him that I had been praying for it.   My mission commenced there and  it never has ended to the present  hour. I have had a responsibility   resting upon me in connection with  my brethren.    Now, before I close, I will again   bear my testimony that this work is  of God. This tabernacle that you  are in today was seen by the Prophet

 unto me. But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a  house unto me, and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build  a house unto me; and during this time your baptisms shall be  acceptable unto me.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:32-36|11## But, behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms for  your dead shall not be acceptable unto me, and if you do not these  things, at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a  church with your dead saith the Lord your God. For, verily,  I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to build  a house unto me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth,  and for which the same was instituted from before the foundation of  the world, your baptisms for your dead cannot be acceptable unto me,  for therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you  may receive honor and glory. And after this time, your baptisms for  the dead, by those who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto  me, saith the Lord; for it is ordained that in Zion and in her stakes,  and in Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge,  shall be the place for your baptisms for your dead.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:37-39|12## And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washing be  acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you  have built to my name? For, for this cause I commanded  Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear  it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land  of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed, which had  been hid from before the world was; therefore verily I say unto  you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for  the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices,  by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places,  wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes, and judgments,  for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for  the glory, honor, and endownment of all her municipals, are ordained  by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always  commanded to build unto my holy name.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:40-46|13## And verily I say unto you let this house be built unto my  name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people;  for I deign to reveal unto my church, things which have been kept

 Isaiah and other prophets, and they  spoke of it, as well as the temples that   are built in the valleys of the moun-  tains. All have been pointed out by  the prophets of God, and the Lord re-  vealed to Isaiah, Jeremiah and many  other prophets, our day, our history,   our lives, our position in this immense  barren desert which has been occupied  by the Latter-day Saints, and is as we   see it today through the blessings of God.  I will bear my testimony to the world  to my friends of the Church and the   State, and to all men under heaven,  that this is the truth of God. The  Lord Almighty has set His hand to  accomplish this work. Joseph Smith  was raised up by the power of God and  the revelations of Jesus Christ   to organize this Church and king-  dom in the dispensation of the   fullness of times. His life was short,  as was the Savior's. But it was a great  work that he performed in the flesh.  The Savior lived about three and a  half years after he entered the minis-  try. Joseph Smith lived some fourteen  years from the time he received the   plates and translated them into the   English language. He laid down his   life, as did Christ and His Apostles,   for the word of God and testimony of  Jesus Christ. He will rise in his glori-  fied celestial body and meet again with  his brethren the Apostles and Elders   of Israel and this people, and will   stand in days to come as the leader  among us in celestial glory. I  feel to bear my testimony to this. It  matters not about the unbelief of   men. They cannot turn away the   work of Almighty God. The Lord has  set His hand to carry out these great  principles which He has revealed,   the establishing of the Zion of God  and the preparation for the coming  of the Son of Man. What has been   said about the mountains of Israel  will have its fulfillment. The judg-  ments of God will follow in the earth  in fulfillment of what has been said,   and no power on earth can stay them.  I am anxious, although my life has   been preserved to this great age, I   still am anxious that we as a people  may do our duty, may live our re-  ligion, may keep the faith, may so  walk before the Lord that the Holy  Ghost may be our constant companion   to lead us in the days that lie before  us. This is my prayer and my desire,  in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

If you labour with all your mights, I will consecrate  that spot, that it shall be made holy; and if my people will  hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom  I have appointed, to lead my people, behold verily I say unto  you, they shall not be moved out of their place. But if they  will not hearken to my voice nor unto the voice of these men  whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they  pollute mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters,  and my holy words, which I give unto them.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:47-48|14## And it shall come to pass, that if you build a house  unto my name, and do not the things that I say, I will not  perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil  the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord  for instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring cursings,  wrath indignation, and judgments upon your own heads by your  follies, and by all your abominations which you practise before  me saith the Lord.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:49-52|15##  Verily, verily I say unto you that when I give a commandment  unto any of the sons of men, to do a work unto my name, and those  sons of men go with all their mights, and with all they have,  to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their  enemies come upon them, and hinder them from performing  that work: behold it behooveth me to require that work no  more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their  offerings; and the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws  and commandments, I will visit upon the heads of those  who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation,  so long as they repent not and hate me saith the Lord God.

Therefore let my servant Joseph and his  seed after him, have place in that house from generation to  generation, for ever and ever saith the Lord, and let the  name of that house be called the Nauvoo House, and let it  be a delightful habitation for man, and a resting place  for the weary traveller, that he may contemplate the glory  of Zion, and the glory of this the corner stone thereof; that  he may receive, also, the counsel from those whom I have set to be  as plants of renown, and as watchmen upon her walls.

 generation to generation.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:81|26## Let my servant Henry G. Sherwood pay stock into that  house as seemeth him good for himself and his seed after  him from generation to generation.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:82-87|27## Let my servant William Law pay stock into that house  for himself and his seed after him, from generation to  generation. If he will do my will let him not take his  family unto the eastern lands, even unto Kirtland, nevertheless  I the Lord will build up Kirtland, but I the Lord have a scourge  prepared for the inhabitants thereof. And with my servant Almon  Babbitt there are many things with which I am not well pleased;  behold he aspireth to establish his council instead of the council  which I have ordained, even the presidency of my church, and  he setteth up a golden calf for the worship of my people.  Let no man go from this place who has come here essaying to  keep my commandments. If they live here let them live unto me,  and if they die, let them die unto me; for they shall rest from  all their labors here and shall continue their works.   Therefore let my servant William put his trust in me, and  cease to fear concerning his family because of the sickness of  the land. If ye love me keep my commandments, and the   sickness of the land shall redound to your glory.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:88-90|28## Let my servant William go and proclaim mine everlasting  gospel, with a loud voice, and with great joy as he shall be moved  upon by my spirit unto the inhabitants of Warsaw and also  unto the inhabitants of Carthage and also unto the inhabitants of  Madison and await patiently and diligently for further  instructions at my general conference saith the Lord. If he  will do my will let him, from henceforth, hearken to the counsel  of my servant Joseph, and with his interest support the cause  of the poor, and publish the new translation of my holy word  unto the inhabitants of the earth; and if he will do this, I will  bless him, with a multiplicity of blessings, that he shall not be forsaken  nor his seed be found begging bread.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:91-96|29## And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William  be appointed, ordained, and anointed as a councillor unto my

 servant Joseph, in the room of my servant Hyrum; that my servant  Hyrum may take the office of Priesthood and patriarch, which  was appointed unto him by his father by blessing and also by  right, that from henceforth he shall hold the keys of the  patriarchal blessings upon the heads of all my people, that whoever  he blesses shall be blessed and whoever he curseth shall be  cursed: that whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be bound  in heaven, and whatsoever he shall loose on earth, shall be  loosed in heaven; and from this time forth, I appoint unto  him, that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto  my church, as well as my servant Joseph, that he may act in  concert also, with my servant Joseph, and that he shall receive  counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall shew unto him the keys,  whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned with the same  blessings. I crown upon his head, the bishoprick, and blessing,  and glory, and honor and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood,  that once were put upon him that was servant Oliver Cowdery;  that my servant Hyrum, may bear record of the things which  I shall shew unto him, that his name may be had in honorable  rememb[r]ance from generation to generation, for ever and ever.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:97-101|30## Let my servant William Law, also receive the keys by which  he may ask and receive blessings; let him be humble before me,  and be without guile and he shall receive of my spirit,  even the comforter, which shall manifest unto him the truth  of all things, and shall give him in the very hour, what he  shall say, and these signs shall follow him: he shall heal  the sick, he shall cast out devils, and shall be delivered from  those who would administer unto him deadly poison, and he  shall be led in paths where the poisonous serpent cannot lay hold  upon his heel, and he shall mount up in the imagination of his  thoughts as upon Eagles wings; and what if I will that he should  raise the dead, let him not withhold his voice: Therefore, let my  servant William cry aloud and spare not, with joy and rejoicing,  and with hosannas to him that sitteth upon the throne for ever  and ever, saith the Lord your God.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:102|31## Behold! I say unto you, I have a mission in store for my servant 
 William, and my servant Hyrum, and for them alone, and let my  servant Joseph tarry at home, for he is needed; the remainder I will  shew unto you hereafter, even so: Amen.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:103-110|32## And again verily I say unto you, if my servant Sidney  will serve me and be councillor unto my servant Joseph, let him  arise, and come up and stand in the office of his calling and  humble himself before me; and if he will offer unto me an acceptable  offering and acknowledgments, and remain with my people; behold  I the Lord your God will heal him that he shall be healed, and he  shall lift up his voice again on the mountains, and be a spokesman  before my face. Let him come and locate his family in the  neighborhood in which my servant Joseph resides, and in all  his journeyings let him lift up his voice as with the sound of a  trump and warn the inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to  come, let him assist my servant Joseph; and also let my servant  William Law assist my servant Joseph in making a solemn  proclamation unto the kings of the earth, even as I have before said  unto you. If my servant Sidney will do my will, let him  not move his family unto the eastern lands, but let him change  their habitation even as I have before said unto you.  If my  servant Sidney will do my will, let him not  move his  family Behold it is not my will that he shall seek to find  safety and refuge out of the city which I have appointed  unto you even the city of Nauvoo. Verily I say unto you,  even now, if he will hearken to my voice it shall be well  with him, even so: Amen.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:111-114|33## And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant  Amos Davis pay stock into the hands of those whom I have  appointed to build a house for boarding, even the Nauvoo  House; this let him do if he will an have an interest; and let  hearken unto the counsel of my servant Joseph, and labor  with his own hands that he may obtain the confidence of men,  and when he shall prove himself faithful in all things  that shall be entrusted unto his care, yea even a few  things, he shall be made ruler over many: let him therefore  abase himself, that he may be exalted even so: Amen. 
 ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:115-118|34## And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant Robert D.  Foster will obey my voice, let him build a house for my servant  Joseph according to the contract which he has made with him, as  the door shall be open to him from time to time; and let him repent  of all his folly, and clothe himself with charity, and cease to do evil  and lay aside all his hard speeches, and pay stock also into the  hands of the quorum of the Nauvoo House, for himself and for  his generation after him, from generation to generation and hearken  unto the counsel of my servant Joseph and Hyrum and William  Law, and unto the authorities which I have called to lay the foundation  of Zion and it shall be well with him, for ever and ever; even so:  Amen.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:119-120|35## And again, verily I say unto you, let no man pay stock to the  Quorum of the Nauvoo House, unless he shall be a believer  in the Book of Mormon; and the revelations I have given unto   you saith the Lord your God: for that which is more or less than  this cometh of evil and shall be attended with cursing and not  blessings saith the Lord your God, even so: Amen.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:121-122|36## And again verily I say unto you, let the quorum of the Nauvoo  House have a just recompense of wages for all their labors which  they do in building the Nauvoo House, and let their wages be as shall  be agreed among themselves as pertaining to the price thereof; and   let every man who pays stock bear his proportion of their wages,  if it must needs be for their support saith the Lord, otherwise their  labours shall be accounted unto them for stock in that   House even so: Amen.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:123|37## Verily I say unto you I now give unto you the offices   belonging to my Priesthood that ye may hold the keys thereof  even the priesthood which is after the order of Melchisedek, which  is after the order of my only begotten Son.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:124|38## For I give unto you Hyrum Smith to be a patriarch unto  you to hold the sealing blessings of my church, even the Holy  Spirit of Promise, whereby ye are sealed up unto the day of redemption  that ye may not fall, notwithstanding the hour of temptation that  may come upon you.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:125-126|39## I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding Elder over 
 all my church, to be a Translator, a Revelator, a Seer, and Prophet:  I give unto him for Councillors my servant Sidney Rigdon,  and my servant William Law, that these may constitute a quorum,  and first presidency to receive the oracles for the whole church.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:127-130|40## I give unto you my servant Brigham Young to be a president  over the Twelve Travelling Council, which twelve hold the  keys to open up the authority of my kingdom upon the four  corners of the earth, and after that to send my word to every creature  they are Heber C Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Orson  Hyde, William Smith, John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford  Woodruff, Willard Richards, George A. Smith,: David  Patten I have taken unto myself, behold his priesthood no man  taketh from him, but verily I say unto you, another may be  appointed unto the same calling.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:131-132|41## And, again, I say unto you, I give unto you a High  Council for the corner stone of Zion, viz. Samuel Bent, H. G.  Sherwood, George W. Harris, Charles C Rich, Thomas  Grover, Newel Night, David Dort, Dunbar Wilson:  Seymour Brunson I have taken unto myself no man  taketh his; but another may be appointed unto the same  priesthood in his stead, (and verily I say unto you let my  servant Aaron Johnson be ordained unto this calling in his  stead) David Fulmer, Alpheus Cutler, William Huntington.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:133-136|42## And again I give unto you Don C Smith to be a  president over a Quorum of high priests: which  ordinance is instituted for the purpose of qualifying  those who shall be appointed standing presidents or  servants over different stakes scattered abroad, and  they may travel also if they choose, but rather be ordained  for standing presidents, this is the office of their calling  saith the Lord your God. I give unto him Amasa Lyman  and Noah Packard for councillors that they may preside  over the quorum of high priests of my church saith the Lord.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:137|43## And again I say unto you, I give unto you John A. Hicks,  Samuel Williams, and Jesse Baker which priesthood is  to preside over the quorum of Elders which quorum is instituted 
 for standing ministers nevertheless they may travel, yet they are  to be ordained for ^to be^ standing ministers to my church saith  the Lord.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:138-140|44## And, again, I give unto you Joseph Young, Josiah  Butterfield, Daniel Miles, Henry Herriman, Zera  Pulsipher, Levi Hancock, James Foster, to preside over the  quorum of seventies, which quorum is instituted for travelling  elders to bear record of my name in all the world, wherever  the travelling high Council, my Apostles, shall send them  to prepare a way before my face. The difference between  this quorum and the quorum of Elders is, that one is to  travel continually, and the other is to preside over the  churches from time to time, the one has the responsibility  of presiding from time to time and the other has no  responsibility of presiding saith the Lord your God.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:141|45## And again I say unto you I give unto you Vinson  Knight, Samuel H. Smith, and Shadrack Roundy if he  will receive it to preside over the Bishopric, a knowledge of  said Bishopric is given unto you in the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants.    ##Doctrine and Covenants 124:142-145|46## And again, I give unto you Samuel Rolfe and  his Councillors for Priests, and the president of the Teachers  and his Councillors, and also the president of the Deacons  and his Councillors and also the president of the stake and  his Councillors: the above offices I have given unto you,  and the keys thereof for helps and for governments, for the  work of the ministry, and the perfecting of my saints, and a  commandment I give unto you that you should fill all  these offices and approve of those names which I have  mentioned or else disapprove of them at my general  conference, and that ye should prepare rooms for all these  offices in my house when you build it unto my name saith the  Lord your God. even so: Amen.

Heaven's eternal day's before thee -  That God's own hand shall guide thee there  Soon shall close thy earthly mission  Soon shall pass thy pilgrim dayes-  Hope shall change to glad fruition  Faith to sight and prayer to praise.

O ye who die in your sins you must in Eternity forever dwell  In Prision confined in chanes of Darkness bound, No light to cheer the soul  In sin you'll Helpless lie the worm that never dies No peace will ^give^ or change the fate of Hell  How can Hope the sinner find, when times No more, and darkness round him rolls    Wake up ye Nations the voice of God declares this to he the last accepted time ^day^  Go whare God shall call, put my Armour on the Battle face, & great is thy reward  If you will the glory gain which your'e invited to take up your cross be Mine ^walk in the way^  For this is the Eleventh hour, the last accepted time, saith the Lord your God

Some of the  religious denominations have   presented to the cCollege books treating  on their religion. As the school  is patronized almost exclusively by  Mormons and as our cChurch works  are often asked for I write to ask if  a set could not be sent us.

 My Own Mountain Land  Wilford Woodruff    O talk not to me of fair Italy's sky.  Of the soft performed gales, that through Araby sigh;  I know their is not on this widespreading earth   A land Bright and free as this land of my birth;  We have our mild zephers and bright sunny beams,   Our fruits and our flours, fair vallies and streams;  Thy rocks and thy mountains are lofty and Grand,  And Brave are thy children my own mountain land.    If cowards and tyrents e'er seek to enchain  And Bring to the dust our proud spirits again;   The saints still united will rally for thee  And die as they have lived, the exalted and free  O had I the strength of my heart in my hand  I'd fight for thy freedom my own mountain land  Amid thy oppressors undaunted I'd fly  And fling forth our Banners in triumph on high

They wish to know, not   from idle curiosity, and   have asked me so to   write you. They, like the   late N. C. Brann, believ a   that man is by nature a   polygamous being, and,   provided polygamy is still   practiced in Salt Lake City,   contemplate moving there

 Kanarra Feb ^March^ 1, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    Having re-  ceived a call from you to   go on a mission, I write   for further information as   I do not know how long it   takes to go from Salt Lake City   ^to Sanfrancisco^ and would like to know some   wheres near the price of fair.   Am sorry to say I have but   little means, but do not feel   to shrink from duty, when   called by those whose right   it is to call.    Under my circumstances in   life I have been unable to   work to gain the comforts of 
 gosple. When our Bishop asked   me to go I thought they had   to have a man to go in a   few weeks and so I concsented   but since I have had time   to think it apeares to me my   time would be lost if I   went as I am now, and for   that reason I ask to be excused.   My father said he would be glad   to help me to go to school, I   have a wife and one baby, and but   little means to go on, and for  that reason I think while I   have a shance to go to school   with out charges I ought to   go, and if I hcan I will   be prepared to do a good work   when I go on my mission.   Hoping to hear from you by retun   mail, I remain as ever your   brother    W. M. Riddle.
