 I want to know now, if the brethrencan really and truly realize our trueposition with regard to the Lamanites,or do you consider them a poor, lost, sunken race of beings that are not worth saving? Do you ever read the Book of Mormon? If you do,do you believe and realize thetruth of its sayings, and also whatthe Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph? These are things thatwe have in our possession; wehave them in the Book of Doctrineand Covenants and in the History of Joseph Smith. Do you look them over? If you do, and if you lay them to heart as the things of God, you will feel that it is actually our duty to do all we possibly canto benefit, enlighten and save thisdark and ignorant people. Do youfeel like killing off the Laman-ites? I tell you there is no manthat will ever feel like killing them if he possesses the Spiritof the Lord. Well, says one,"do you ever feel like chastisingthem brother Brigham?" Yes, I do,but I let the Spirit of the HolyGospel direct me; but until thelight of the Holy Gospel shone upon me I felt like other men. When the Priesthood was restored,and the light of truth burst in upon my mind, I knew then thatif it were not for the Israel-ites the Gentiles might go to helland be damned. The Lord wouldnot take much pains with us any-how, were it not for the pro-mised seed. Instead of them beinginferior to us in birthright, they are superior, and they stand firstin many instances, with regard tothe promises in particular. Well, but says one, "how will youprove this?" I will tell you, if we had been of the house of Israeland forsaken our God as much as wehave, and despised his ordinancesand trampled them under our feet, we would have been cursed like theseLamanites are, this is my proof. Ifthe Gentiles had been of the house ofIsrael, legal heirs to the Priesthood, and had received their oracles as thehouse of Israel did, you would have found that the same curse would havecome upon the Gentiles that you now see upon these Lamanites, but inas-much as they were not of the pro-mised seed, to them the blessingsdid not pertain, and they had no part nor lot in them, only as theywere afterward granted on conditionof obedience. The Son of God came through Israel, but we Gentiles beingstrangers, and foreigners, and aliens,in a national point, we had nothing to do with putting Christ to death,and hence the curse did not comeupon the Gentiles. When they are restored, will they not stand beforethe Gentiles? Will they not be numbered with the Sons of God and be adorned with the giftsand graces of the Gospel, and stand before the Gentiles? Yes, theywill! Now, what do the peoplethink? I should like to know what this congregation think about it.There are a good many brethren and sisters here from Springville,Palmyra, and Payson, what do you all think about it? Had we better drive them away out of thecountry? Or, had we best take hold and bring them into the Gospel of Jesus Christ? Now, ifthis people, male and female, feelto school them, spend time and pains to instil into their minds correct principles, to divide land with them, and clothe them, drawtheir wood for them until they learn to draw their own, and farm for them until they learn to farm for themselves, and if they will no more slay them, no more seclude them from their houses and hospi-tality, and will go to work andrestore them to the knowledge of 
 We have labored upon this prin-ciple for 50 years. You cast youreyes and you see a tabernacle inthe desert; you see a city; and youmay travel for a thousand miles andyou will find this Territory filled with cities, towns and villages. Bywhat power have these things beenaccomplished? I came here on the24th of July, 1847, with a little handful of men as pioneers. What did we find? A barren desert, as barren as the desert Sahara. No mark of the white man here. Nooutward sign that a white man could live here. How has this desertbeen made to blossom as the rose? Why this body of people from almost every nation? I will tellyou. We carried the Gospel to Europe, the Islands of the sea, andthe different nations of the earth; we offered them the Gospel, and aclass of men and women—two of afamily, and sometimes a dozen of acity—received our testimony, andwhen we laid hands upon them they received the Holy Ghost. That Holy Ghost has remained withthem: it has instructed them and inspired their hearts, and to-day you see Utah as it is. If the Lord Almighty had not backed up thetestimony of the Elders of Israel asHe has done, Utah to-day would havebeen as when we found it 36 yearsago.This is the condition of the Lat-ter-day Saints. Joseph Smith received these keys, this Priesthood, this power, this Gospel by the ad-ministration of angels from God,and this testimony is true. He alsoreceived a record called the Book ofMormon, which is a record of theancient inhabitants of this continent.That record is true; as also theBook of Doctrine and Covenants, acode of revelations given through the Prophet Joseph Smith. These revelations are true andfaithful, and they are being fulfilled as fast as time will admit. I bearmy testimony of these things to theworld, for I know they are true.I traveled thousands of miles withJoseph Smith. I knew his spirit.Many of the revelations given through him have been fulfilled.I myself wrote the revelation that was given through him con-cerning the war that would takeplace in this country between thenorth and south. That revelation was published to the world fortwenty years before the war. It brokeout just as predicted, and I refer to it because it is one of the revelationsthat is fulfilled. To-day we are still preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.The Lord Almighty has set Hishand to establish His Church andkingdom on the earth, to build up Zion in the mountains of Israel.Now with regard to the Priesthood. We have been found fault with sometimes because we profess tohave the Priesthood.  Let me sayto this congregation that ourHeavenly Father performs all Hisworks—the creation of worlds, theredemption of worlds—by the power of the Eternal Priesthood. Andno man on the earth, from the daysof Father Adam to the presenttime, has ever had power to admin-ister in any of the ordinances of lifeand salvation only by the power of the Holy Priesthood. You will find this to be the case in the wholehistory of the Prophets of God.When Aaron was given the Priest-hood he was called by revelation. "No man taketh this honor untohimself but he that is called of Godas was Aaron." Jesus Christ him-self had to be called of God. He was a High Priest. He left thePriesthood on the earth with his 
 the truth the Lord God will blessthem, and they have nothing to fear. If you will live up to this you will rise, while those who donot will go down. If this people will observe this covenant, and follow it one and all, (and here are the leading men in these mountains be-longing to several of the tribes, and they feel well), thousands and hun-dreds of thousands will embrace this Gospel, and for ought I knowscores of thousands will become members of this Church.Now, if you will take hold of thewheel and lift, it may be grantedunto us to accomplish this great work, and I tell you that you willreceive the blessings of the Gospel,such as you never received before, ifyou will make up your minds to be favourable and merciful unto themin their filthiness, and in their ignorance, these blessings are yours.But if you get angry and kill them, you will not obtain them.Say to them, "if you steal and destroy our property we will bearwith you, and while you are ignor-ant we will bear with you," and if this people will take this coursefrom this time forth, they will feel the power of God more than they ever did in these last daysbefore. (The congregation hereunited in a loud "Amen.") And you are finding it so, too.Just give them what they want;I tell you it is the cheapest wayto fight them. You can draw them to you and make them bendto anything if you use them well. And if any man abuses them, let him be dealt with by the civil authorities, and in this wayyou will succeed in the work youhave in view.May God bless you all. Amen. 
 Apostles. They officiated in it untilthey were put to death. It is by that power that we administer inthis day and generation. The Church and kingdom of God hascontinued to grow from its firstorganization. It is true we havebeen called to pass through manyafflictions in our day and time. Nevertheless, the Lord has preservedHis people, and they still live herein the valleys of the mountains.We have an anxiety to honor Godand keep His commandments, andto honor our country and the Con-stitution of our Government. That Constitution we believe was given by revelation, and whatever laws are passed agreeable to it we desireto honor. It guarantees to all men the right to enjoy their religion, toworship God according to the dictatesof their conscience."But," says one, "I would like toknow how many wives you have.That is a matter you havenot said anything about." Well,now, I will tell you a little anecdotein connection with Sidney Rigdon. The circumstance took place a greatmany years ago, in Kirtland. A young Elder just come in met Presi-dent Rigdon on the street one day in the vicinity of the Temple. Said the young man: "President Rigdon,will you please tell me the meaningof the horns of the beast John saw?"President Rigdon, drawing himself up, looked at the young man, and replied: "My dear brother, there isa great deal between you and the beast that John saw," and walked away. Well, I sometimes think itis so with this generation. There isa great deal between the people ofthis generation and the plurality ofwives. There are a great many principles that God has revealed inthese last days that it is necessary for us to understand before we cometo that principle. But as I have brought the subject up I will say afew words upon it. The Lord hasrevealed to us that no kingdom, no king, no prince, no president, no ordinance of marriage, no ordinanceperformed by any man from thedays of father Adam, will have any power or force after death, except those ordinances are performed bymen holding the Eternal Priesthood.Is there a king, is there a prince, isthere a queen,—will either whenthey pass the other side of the veil,find a throne there? Would theCzar of Russia, who was assassinatedby the hands of the ungodly notlong ago, when he went into the Spirit world find a throne there?No. Why? Because the kingdom of the Czar of Russia belonged totime. When he went into the Spirit world that was the end of hiskingdom and power. His kingdom had not been sealed upon his headby any man having the power and authority of the Eternal Priesthood. So in regard to all kingdoms andthrones. You may take Her MajestyQueen Victoria—who has reigned a long time, and who is perhaps asgood a sovereign as has reigned sincethe days of William the Conqueror.When she passes behind the veil shewill find her kingdom at an end, because it was not sealed upon herhead for time and eternity by any man having the authority of the Holy Priesthood. So I will say to our friends here—the strangerswithin our gates—that  any man thatmarries a wife by any other authority than the authority of the Holy Priesthood is simply married fortime, "or until death do you part." When you go into the Spirit worldyou have no claim on your wife andchildren. The ordinance of having them sealed to you by one having the authority of the Holy Priest- 
 hood must be attended to in thisworld. Father Abraham obeyedthe law of the patriarchal order ofmarriage. His wives were sealed tohim for time and all eternity, andso were the wives of all the Patri-archs and Prophets that obeyed thatlaw.I desire to testify as an individualand as a Latter-day Saint that Iknow that God has revealed this lawunto this people. I know that if wehad not obeyed that law we shouldhave been damned; the judgmentsof God would have rested upon us;the kingdom of God would have stopped right where we were whenGod revealed that law unto us.Why have we obeyed it? I obeyedit because I want my wife or wiveswith me after death; I want my wives and children with me in themorning of the resurrection; I wantmy wives and children organized inthe family organization, that I may dwell with them and they with me, throughout all eternity, as well as with Father Abraham and other men who honored and obeyed thatlaw. This is the position we occupy.We have obeyed the law becauseGod has commanded us, and I bearrecord of its truth; and so far as Iam concerned, if I can have mywives and children with me in themorning of the resurrection, so that I can dwell with them and with those Patriarchs and Prophets who obeyed that law, it will amply repayme for the trials and tribulations I may have had to pass through in the course of my life here up on theearth. Many men suppose that we have obeyed that law to gratify thelusts of the flesh. Bless your soul, if that had been our object, we might have followed the exampleof the people of the Christian world—committed whoredom and adul-tery—without bringing upon our-selves the cares, pains, and penaltiesthat we have to bear by obeying this law. But let me tell you that theLatter-day Saints look upon adulteryas one of the greatest crimes anyman can commit in this world. Itis next to murder. No, this peoplehave not obeyed that law becauseof a desire to gratify the lusts of theflesh; they have observed it in obedi-ence to the command of God, and because it will have power and effectafter death.I pray God to pour out His Holy Spirit upon us, that our ears may be open to hear and our hearts tounderstand the things of the king-dom of God, which is my prayer inthe name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Civiland religious liberty is the keystone inthe arch of the glorious Constitutionof our country; if that be taken awaythe whole fabric must fall to pieces.This Government is in the hands ofGod. My life is of but small conse-quence when compared with my hopesof eternal happiness. No power willput down this work for God is at thehelm and will guide it safely through.President Young has done and is doing all in his power to benefit mankind,thus following in the footsteps of theprophet Joseph.

Whether it is a copy ofwritings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxiousto put in your possesion all writings that you have sent him or that he hasdirected to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death hasclosed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feelit my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness& Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I alsofeel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit& I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much uponmy mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t]omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent itemsFirstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 rom[Septe] & [Azubah] & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson in fine I havein my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well ashis own compositions. I took them because I suppose that I should be ableto put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Harte.  I shall give youinformation upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not hadtime as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there isamong them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents & Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo-sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of hisclerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness & death & I learnthe following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect-able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted[upside-down text]Wilford Woodruff toEunice Woodruffgivi[g]the Acco[un]t of the deathof Ashael Woodruff[end of upside-down text] 
 North Lat. 44, Long 69, 10. North Fox Islands, Vinalhaven, Maine, Sept. 15, 1837Aphek & Azubah Woodruff,Honoured ParentsAs dutyAnd the commandments of God hath called your Son to stand uponthe Islands of the sea in defence of the word of God, & the testi-mony of Jesus Christ, I am under the necessity of makinguse of my pen to communicate all information that yourecieve from me, but this is a privilege inasmuch as we cannot do it by word of mouth. I would inform you that Irecieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that shetook two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word hadthe desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like tobe with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up aChurch, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent amongyou to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I amdoing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland onboard the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the firsthouse & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island.they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in thecentre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of theLord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deaconto come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message tothe people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us intothe pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressedthe congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the firsttime the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea,to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments forpreaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (thisBaptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In thefirst fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear.The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us& would not let us have the meeting house.

 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him.Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things && calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of thesea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. OnSunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from differentIslands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady cameforeward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Halelead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islandsof the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min-istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the sameplace from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closedanother sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I leadthem forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & ladehands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesdayfollowing three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto themby Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath notsent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step intothe waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come &preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet-ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodistchurch, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tidemills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitableto strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. NorthIsland is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro-ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are nowin the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but arenow mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office &store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think asany think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universalmass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for thecoves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it issupposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small partsof this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the samemanner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supplygreater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their ismany kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel,stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, DolphinFrost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers,Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels, Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on theshore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that wewished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertilethan these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more

 Where is the religion, principle, Holiness, gifts, graces, fruits, Gospel, FaithChurch & its affects to to be found in this generation that was with the Ancients well says one their is no need of them Now, has Godor his gospel changed certainly not & the same causes will producethe same affect to day as Anciently The Apostle exhorts us to contendfor that faith once delivered to the Saints wher is the honest Searcher aftertruth that cannot see what the faith of the Saints was it was by faiththat that the worlds were framed [FIGURE] God spake Chaos heard & worlds came intoorder by reason of the faith there was in him. So with man also—he spake by faithin the name of God, and the sun stood still, the moon ob[eyed], mountains [r]emoved, prisonsfell, lions mouths were closed, the human heart lost its enmity, fire its violence, armiestheir power, the sword its terror, and death its dominion, and all this by reasonof the faith which was in them.

If the Roman church is the mother of harlots is not herdaughters visible & if the fountain is corrupt are not the streams alsoI look upon this generation of Gentiles as a Body as standing inthe same situation with regard ^to^ the Second Comeing of Christ asthe Jews were at his first & that day of calamity which is at thedoor will surely overtake them as a theiief in the night & their unbelievingthe word of God will not make the truth of it without affect The signs areputing fourth of the second advent of Christ the Church is travling outof the wilderness the standard is erecting to it we some of the Gentilesare seeking the treese are puting fourth leaves the stone rolls the Kingdomgrows & will soon fill the Earth & God will bring to pass his act his strangeact the walls of Zion will be reared in beauty & glory the Lamaniteswill blossom as the rose the whole house of Israel will be gathered the Tabernacleof God will dwell with men.

 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyardI remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priestbecame alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing& made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went outto hear him. He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principlesI wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expectto meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so Iarose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation.The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several prieststo come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surelyfall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O yepriests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his peopleThe stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, andwith them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lordof Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdomon the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel ofJESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands hasalready entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormonhas this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade inships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weaponformed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it is fightingagainst God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself]& the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of mymeditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been & whareere I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn]myself. A few years since, I was tending mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn]to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn]the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn]Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [the] [s]eventy Apostles to [page torn]from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these lastdays in rending the Kingdom of darkness, and [illegible word] with everlasting truth. It has called me tovisit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, andare now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instructionat my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I amsapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the seaspread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid thesetruths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, IlliterateWillford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this,but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak thingsof this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of ChristI cannot tell when I shall see any of you again, their was some invisidble power seemed tohurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached theseIslands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of theIslands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilegeto visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have greatfaith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to mysoul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expectto spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000inhabitants, and there is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friendsmay still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring friends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. DearParents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. ElderHale & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of God may abide with you & thatyour lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the Prayer of your Dutiful son Willford Woodruff

 Revelation given to Joseph SmithJanuary 19th 1841:##Doctrine and Covenants 124:1-6|1## Verily thus saith the Lord, unto you my servant Joseph Smith,I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments whichyou have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I mightshew forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth.Your prayers are acceptable before me, and in answer to them,I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to makea solemn proclamation of my gospel and of this stake whichI have planted to be a corner stone of Zion, which shall bepolished with that refinement which is after the similitude ofa palace. This proclamation shall be made to all the kingsof the world to the four corners thereof—To the honorable presidentelect, and the high minded governors of the nation in which you liveand to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad. Let it bewritten in the spirit of meekness, and by the power of the HolyGhost which shall be in you at the time of the writing of thesame; for it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know mywill concerning those kings and authorities, even what shall befallthem in a time to come. For, behold! I am about to call uponthem to give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the settime has come to favor her.##Doctrine and Covenants 124:7-10|2## Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation andwith your testimony, fearing them not, for they are as grass,and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth,that they may be left also without excuse, and that Imay visit them in the day of visitation, when I shallunveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion ofthe oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashingof teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimonywhich I have revealed unto them. And, again I willvisit and soften their hearts, many of them, for your good,that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come tothe light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or liftingup of Zion. For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, inan hour when ye think not of, and where shall be the safety

 APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFtook the stand, expressing his satis-faction with the fair showing of theAssociations as manifested by the morning's report. There was some-thing he had on his mind, to presentto the congregation. First he re-ferred to the Prophet Joseph whohad been raised up to lay the founda-tion of this great Church and King-dom, through the revelations of the Lord. The speaker gave a rapid outline of the many glorious mani-festations received by the Prophet Joseph, from time to time. All the glories and exultations ever granted to man were bestowed upon him.  The 109th section of the Doctrineand Covenants was then read, con-taining the great visions received byJoseph and the Twelve at the occa-sion of the dedication of the Templeat Nauvoo. These visions are thetestimony of Joseph Smith havingreceived the keys of the Kingdom.In the winter of 1838 to [18]39 Joseph Smith called the Twelve together inthe city of Nauvoo, giving to them their endowments as Apostles. El-der Woodruff here bore a strong tes-timony to the truth of these endow-ments having been given by Joseph to the Apostles. The Prophet taught the Twelve many things pertaining to the priesthood and revealed tothem their duties, rejoicing greatlyin being privileged to confer the keysand powers of the holy priesthood upon other men to remain on earthforever and ever. The Prophet also told the Twelve that he would notlive to see the Temple built, but they would, and it was now their duty to bear off the Kingdom. The room where Joseph was talking of the things of God was full with holy influences. The responsbility rest-ing upon the Twelve is not to bethrown off; neither can any memberof the priesthood refuse to bear off the Kingdom, or they will come un-der condemnation. He had no am-bition, but the desire to do his duty towards the Kingdom of God, and the longer he lived and had the vis-ion of his mind open to him, the less he cared for the things and wealth of this world. It was hisduty, as a father in Israel to counselthe people, since the Prophet and many of the original Twelve havegone beyond. Seeing the fast ap-proach of departure from this stageof action, it was his duty to improve his time and counsel the people withall the wisdom imparted by the spir-it of the Lord. The speaker thengave some valuable counsel to the young with regard to the librariesthey intended starting, warning them against the pernicious readingof novels and advising them to get books of valuable information where-with to store their minds, such as historical works, descriptions of travels in foreign countries and simi-lar instructive publications.Through the reading of history, the young will learn of the marvel-ous and righteous dealing of Godwith the various nations of the worldin ancient times and modern. This the speaker illustrated very interest-ing by the Persian King Cyrus whowas prospered in all undertakings,for his virtue, temperance, mercy and justice. History all through thelong ages teaches us that whenever a people turned from righteousnessunto wickedness, it was visited withthe chastisements of the Almightywho would always find somebody to execute His decrees. Thus the Jews under Zedekiah were destroy-ed or led into captivity by the Baby-lonian King, [##2 Kings 25:1-9##] and afterwards Baby-lon was destroyed and subjugated by Cyrus, whom the Lord had raisedup to fulfill His purposes. [##2 Chronicles 36:22-23##]The speaker recommended theHistories of Rollin and Josephus as valuable reading matter, proving thefulfillment of the prophecies of the servants of God, as instanced so prominently by Josephus' record ofthe destruction of Jerusalem underthe Roman Emperor Titus. These works give true history, imparting valuable knowledge, and they oughtto be in the libraries of the youngand old. With the history of these ancient nations and their successive overthrow and downfall we ought torealize the importance of our ownposition. We are stepping on to theplatform of the millennium; ap-proaching the world's great crisis.What we have before us should stim-ulate the young to activity and vig-lance in bearing off the Kingdom.  It is only the Latter-day Saints whoare expected of God to do His willand work. Zion never shall be over-thrown, the world may vex and dis-tress us but they cannot overthrow us, or the Church and Kingdom of God. No people ever held such aposition as do the young people of this Church. Therefore the speak-er takes such a transcendent inter-est in the welfare of themselves andtheir institutions. It is by the in-spiration of God that Joseph Smith and the Twelve have borne the testi-mony of the Gospel to all the world. The sons now rising up will havethe burden of the Kingdom on their shoulders and their situation will,in a sense, be different from that oftheir fathers. Storms and wars will then stir up destruction all around, but they will be preserved even un-til the coming of Christ. The young were exhorted to go before the Lordin prayerful humility and they wouldreceive His spirit and a testimony ofthe truth of the gospel. This is a Kingdom that is destined to triumph and stand. The signs of the timesare plainly indicating the rear ap-proach of the Lord. Our own na-tion is turning against us in hatred and with persecution, although the constituton is as broad and wide as the universe. The corruption, wickedness and abomination of the world are calling down the judgments of the Almighty, now as they ever did in former ages. The speaker can plainly see the things awaitingboth Zion and Babylon, for God is a just judge who metes out rewards and punishments to all impartially.Elder Woodruff then addressed apowerful exhortation to the young, to put on the armor of the gospel,avoiding all sin and striving after virtue, and to the older Saints to attend to their progress in faith andsincerity. We have wants and op-presions known to the Lord, for He will fight our battles, causing the wicked to slay the wicked. Let all the house of Israel hear the word ofthe Lord, for all the prophecies and promises of the Lord will surely be fulfilled. The edifying discourse was brought to an end with a fervent prayer for the blessings of God to rest upon all Israel.

Though the papersreport a total repeal of the Nauvoo charter, by a large majority in both houses, we remain undisturbed, and city affairs go on as usual. We expect to appeal to the U. S. CourtSuch being the repudiation of  ^towards her^ our own citizens. Who willpay foreign loans when due? Illinois is now borrowing some millions in London.Little Willie was well, quite recently we heard. Bro Hedlock's family are well. I would like to have Bro Hedlock tarry in England till fall, then come and get his Endowment then perhaps take his family and return, or go Noe where.Sister Hedlock received her box, (sent by Benson,) thankfully.  Not one of the Quorum received any letter from Bro Hedlockthrough Benson, or the ship.The Stone is nearly hewed for the Temple. A new stone font. is about to be eraected. The wood woodwork of the house is progessing rapidly, in a tier of shops, under a temporary roof, oin the basement story^first floor^, and we hope to commence the endowment next fall, or early in the winter.We will probably send out a few elders to Englandin the spring, but not many until after the endowmentI wish you to attend to the Book money and other 
 President Wilford Woodruff was then called upon to address the Saints and in substance was asfollows: "Our Father, who art inHeaven, hallowed by thy name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."  The sectarian world commence their prayers in that manner. Theydo not realize what they are saying  While on the other hand the saints of God fully realize the importanceof this prayer. It is a certain con-solation to every son and daughterof God to know that their Fatherin Heaven is ready and willing to answer the prayers that are offered up to him in humbleness. I know that the God of Heavens lives. That the priesthood which he has given to us is true, and I know that the spirit of God is with this people.He will be with us at all times if we do that which is right in the sight of God. He related the time when he first heard the gospel of Christ. How one night he came home after a hard day's toil fromthe shores of Lake Ontario. The night was wet and chilly, and ashe got inside the door of his homehow he was told that two Mormon elders had been to his house andhad left word that they would hold a meeting that night. He went to that meeting and there he heardthe gospel for the first time. He felt a new hope and he had a desire to know more of that gospel.  He bought a book of Mormon and sat up all night to read it. The next day he went and asked to be baptized, and he and his brother were baptized into the church of God. I have grown up with that gospel which I heard on that stormy night in 1833.We are engaged in a glorious work and ought not to trouble ourselves about the affairs of this world. He hoped, however, that they would look after the things of God instead of work-ing too much for the things of the world. I want the young men who arein the Sabbath schools to grow up pro-perly. Many of the young men are given to smoking, drinking, which is not right in the sight of God. Do not be discouraged with regard to your relig-ion. Your religion is true and you willfind it all right. He related an inci-dent of the power and spirit of God while he was traveling in Staffordshireduring the early days of the church in England. Whilst in the Potteries he had been speaking nearly every night,and moreover he was booked to speak for some time to come. The next night however, the spirit of God told him that that would be the last time he would speek in those parts for sometime to come. He thereupon askedthe Lord to reveal to him what He wished him to do. He was told to go to a place about eighty miles distant. He did not ask any questions but wentas commanded. Arriving there he found a great many people who were ready to receive the gospel. He bap-tised about two thousand people beforehe left for other parts. Also showedto the saints that he was called uponto visit the Fox islands and there also he found many who were desirous to give obedience to the principles of the most holy faith. Spoke of the endow-ments he had received under the Prophet Joseph. Also of how he had been through the persecutions at Kirt-land and other places.The saints of God will be safe whenthe judgements are being poured outover the face of the earth. That the Son of God will come in the clouds ofheaven and dwell with the saints for athousand years on the earth. Look at these things as they are. No man had the authority since the church dwin-dled into unbelief till the power was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith.  The gospel of life and salvation was to both Jew and Gentile. No matter how long I live, whether I tarry for only a while or not the gospel of Christ will go on and fulfil its destiny. God bless you. Amen. 
 [Image]PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.An address of welcome was thenmade by President Woodruff. Hespoke as follows:I feel highly honored this morningin meeting with so many of my friendsupon this important occasion. Yester-day those who were present mighthave observed my condition. I wasperfectly overwhelmed in consequenceof the scene before me. It was notwhat was said particularly, but it brought to my mind in overwhelmingpower my boyhood and earlymanhood and my desires thatI might live upon the earth to find apeople who would receive the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ as taught by Christand the Apostles. In meeting withthousands of the children of the Latter-day Saints, it brought to mymind those scenes and the fulfillmentof my prayers and desires before theLord.I hope this morning I may be able to make a few remarks. I will saythis, it has been a desire of my life,from my boyhood up, never to ad-dress any assembly of people whom Icould not make hear what I had to say.I feel the same this morning; I do notknow whether I can make this as-sembly hear me or not; but I will dothe best I can.As I can hardly expect to everhave the opportunity of addressingthe people of this State and myfriends in days to come Ihave a few reflections uponmy mind that I wish to lay before you.And I will say they are different fromany of my public speeches that I havebeen in the habit of presenting to thepeople. I have consulted no man withregard to the course I should pursue inmy remarks here this morning, and Ido not know that I shall satisfy myfriends in the remarks that I may make.First, I want to say a few wordsupon politics. I hope that will notastonish you. I have not been in thehabit of this heretofore. But I feeldesirous to say a few things that areupon my mind. In the first place,there is not one item, not one sentencein the Constitution of the UnitedStates, nor in the laws of the UnitedStates, or of the State of Utah, that de-prives any citizen, of any name,nature, religion or politics in the land,from joining any political party he wishes or voting for whomsoever hewishes. This is the right of everyman without hindrance. We have been accused at times of using Church influence toguide and direct the State. This is occasionally presented to the public asour action. I feel it my right and duty to say here today that I was acquaintedwith Joseph Smith and associatedwith him from 1833 until his martyr-dom. I have been acquainted withBrigham Young and associated withhim for forty years of my life, at home and abroad, under many circum-stances. I have also been acquaintedwith John Taylor and labored with him in every capacity in which he wascalled to act. I have also been a mem-ber of the quorum of the Twelve Apos-tles for upwards of fifty-six years of my life. And I have been presiding over the Church itself for a few years. I have been associated with my coun-selors and with the present Twelve Apostles. And I want to say upon thisoccasion, before God, angels and all men that are before me, that I never forone instance have ever known anyleader of this Church ever attempt to dictate and direct the affairs of the State as member of the Church. At the same time, whenany man, no matter who he is—Mor-mon, Jew or Gentile—goes forth and uses money or any means to hire mento vote for him, I think he steps out-side of his right, and stands in a measure responsible.I want to say so much to my friends this morning. I have officiated for twenty sessions in the Legislative Council of the Territory of Utah, andone session as a member of the House, and it never cost me one farthing forany office I ever held in the Church or in the State or Territory. And I never asked any mortal man on the face of the earth to cast a vote for methat I have any recollection of. As an ensample, perhaps I may be permittedto say, I am the father of fourteen sons and have a number of sons-in-law, andI believe they are pretty nearly evenly divided on political party lines—Demo-crats and Republicans. I will give any man five dollars if in con-versing with them he can get any oneof them to say that his father ever told him who to vote for. Some of you may try to make a little moneyperhaps at that. (laughter) I con-sider everybody is responsible for him-self, and he has a right to vote for whom he pleases.Again, I never asked any office at the hands of any being in heaven or on earth, not even of my heavenly Father, except upon on instance, which I will relate here. In my boy-hood, as you have heard me testify, I went to the Sabbath schools. I read the New Testament. I saw the doc-trine there portrayed in plainness, astaught by Jesus Christ and His Apos-tles, and it was a glorious doctrine. I

P. Pratt is in N. York, and has the superintendence of all the churches in the East, as he has probably toldyou. All things are going well in that quarter.Rigdonism is about dead. it scarcly lived, and would not have lived at all if the elders had let it alone.Law is preaching about the country that they must removethe Mormons before they finish their Temple, "if they dont all hell cant move them."

 [IMAGE] MRS. EMMA WOODRUFF.had a great desire to live on the earthuntil I could see inspired men who could teach me those principles that Iread of in the New Testament. I prayed a great deal in my boyhood and my early manhood that I mightlive on the earth to receive those principles that I there read of in the New Testament. In1833, for the first time in my life,I saw an Elder in the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints. That was Zera Pulsipher. He told me that hewas inspired of the Lord. He was threshing grain in his barn when the voice of the Lord came to him and told him to arise and go to the north,the Lord had business for him there. He called upon Brother Cheney, hisneighbor and a member of the Church. They traveled sixty miles on foot, in February, in deep snow, and the firstplace they felt impressed to call uponwas the house of my brother and my-self. They went into the house andtalked with my brother's wife, andthey told her who they were and what their business was. They told her that they were moved upon to go tothe north, and they never felt im-pressed to stop anywhere until theycame to that house. When they toldher their principles, she said her hus-band and her brother-in-law both weremen who believed those principles, andthey had prayed for them for years.They appointed a meeting in the schoolhouse upon our farm. I camehome in the evening, and my sister-in-law told me of this meeting. I hadbeen drawing logs from the shores of Lake Ontario (I was in the lumber business), and I turned out my horses,did not stop to eat anything, and went to the meeting. I found the house and the dooryard filled with people. I listened for the first time in my life toa Gospel sermon as taught by the Elders of this Church. It was what Ihad sought for from my boyhood up.I invited the men home with me. Iborrowed the Book of Mormon, and sat up all that night and read. In the morning I told Brother Pulsipher I wanted to be baptized. I had a testimony for myself that those princi-ples were true. Myself and mybrother, as was stated here yesterday,went forth and were baptized—the twofirst in that county. That was the beginning of my connection with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.At this point I will say, upon the subject of religion, what are the rights of men upon religious subjects? I do not know that I can do better than to quote Brother Joseph Smith'sremarks before thousands of people at a conference in Nauvoo, when therewere many non-Mormons present. Hesaid, "If I were the emperor of the world and I had power to control the whole human family, I would sustainevery man, woman and child in the enjoyment of their religion." Those are my sentiments today. I believe every man—Jew, Catholic, Protestant,or anything—has a right to enjoy his religion unmolested. I believe the Constitution of the United States andthe laws of the United States guaran-tee this blessing and privilege to every-body. In fact, I believe that even Robert Ingersoll and his followers have a right to their opinions and to enjoy the same; they have a right to theirviews with regard to God, to Christ, tothe heavens and earth, to thepresent and the future. Still Iwill say, I believe that when Robert Ingersoll goes into thespirit world he will find the Bibleis not a novel. He will learn that there if never before. He will learn that the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sacrifice He made isnot a burlesque, but that that was done for the salvation of the world. And he will find that there will be a Godthere, there will be a heaven there, there will be a hell there, there willbe everything there of which theBible has spoken concerning it.In the spring after I was baptized,I went to Kirtland. There I metwith the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. I met those menthat afterwards formed the quorum ofthe Twelve Apostles. I traveled with Joseph Smith and with that companyof men—205 of them—one thousand miles to the Missouri to assist our brethren in their difficulties. They had been driven from their homes and their lands, from JacksonCounty into Clay County. We traveled a thousand miles together. There I had my first experience of thedealings of God with the Prophet of God. I understood perfectly well thathe was a prophet. I read the vision, I read his revelations, and I knew they could not come from any man on the face of the earth only by the in-spiration of Almighty God. From Missouri I commenced my missionunder Bishop Partridge. In otherwords, I will say that while there Ihad a great desire to preach the Gospel. I had that desire from myboyhood up. I had been a miller, andI had walked my mill hours and hoursin the night, with my soul filled with these desires to preach the Gospel to the children of men. At the time I speak of I was a Teacher, and had nopower and authority to go forth and preach. I went one Sunday into theforest there in Clay county. I was living with Lyman Wight, with halfa dozen of the signers of the Book ofMormon—the Cowderys, the Whit-mers, Judge Higbee, etc. I wentoff by myself and prayed to theLord that I might have the privilege of preaching the Gospel tomy fellowmen. That is all the officethat I ever asked of the Lord or any-body else, as far as that is concerned.While praying the Lord gave me His spirit and answered me that my prayers were heard and would be answered upon my head, and that thatI had asked for should be given me. Iwalked two or three hundred yards outof the forest into an open—a broad highway—in the midst of the forest,and there I saw Judge Higbee stand-ing in the middle of the road with hisarms folded. I walked up to him, and when I got to him he says, "Wilford, the Lord has revealed to me that it isyour duty to be ordained to go andpreach the Gospel." I said, "Is thatso?" He said, "Yes." "Well," says I, "if the Lord wants me to preachthe Gospel I am ready to go and do it to the best of my ability." I did not tell him that I had been praying for it. My mission commenced there andit never has ended to the presenthour. I have had a responsibility resting upon me in connection withmy brethren.Now, before I close, I will again bear my testimony that this work isof God. This tabernacle that youare in today was seen by the Prophet

 unto me. But I command you, all ye my saints, to build ahouse unto me, and I grant unto you a sufficient time to builda house unto me; and during this time your baptisms shall beacceptable unto me.##Doctrine and Covenants 124:32-36|11## But, behold, at the end of this appointment, your baptisms foryour dead shall not be acceptable unto me, and if you do not thesethings, at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as achurch with your dead saith the Lord your God. For, verily,I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to builda house unto me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth,and for which the same was instituted from before the foundation ofthe world, your baptisms for your dead cannot be acceptable unto me,for therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that youmay receive honor and glory. And after this time, your baptisms forthe dead, by those who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable untome, saith the Lord; for it is ordained that in Zion and in her stakes,and in Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge,shall be the place for your baptisms for your dead.##Doctrine and Covenants 124:37-39|12## And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washing beacceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which youhave built to my name? For, for this cause I commandedMoses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bearit with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the landof promise, that those ordinances might be revealed, which hadbeen hid from before the world was; therefore verily I say untoyou, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms forthe dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices,by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places,wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes, and judgments,for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and forthe glory, honor, and endownment of all her municipals, are ordainedby the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are alwayscommanded to build unto my holy name.##Doctrine and Covenants 124:40-46|13## And verily I say unto you let this house be built unto myname, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people;for I deign to reveal unto my church, things which have been kept

 Isaiah and other prophets, and theyspoke of it, as well as the temples that are built in the valleys of the moun-tains. All have been pointed out bythe prophets of God, and the Lord re-vealed to Isaiah, Jeremiah and manyother prophets, our day, our history, our lives, our position in this immensebarren desert which has been occupiedby the Latter-day Saints, and is as we see it today through the blessings of God.I will bear my testimony to the worldto my friends of the Church and the State, and to all men under heaven,that this is the truth of God. TheLord Almighty has set His hand toaccomplish this work. Joseph Smithwas raised up by the power of God andthe revelations of Jesus Christ to organize this Church and king-dom in the dispensation of the fullness of times. His life was short,as was the Savior's. But it was a greatwork that he performed in the flesh.The Savior lived about three and ahalf years after he entered the minis-try. Joseph Smith lived some fourteenyears from the time he received the plates and translated them into the English language. He laid down his life, as did Christ and His Apostles, for the word of God and testimony ofJesus Christ. He will rise in his glori-fied celestial body and meet again withhis brethren the Apostles and Elders of Israel and this people, and will stand in days to come as the leaderamong us in celestial glory. Ifeel to bear my testimony to this. Itmatters not about the unbelief of men. They cannot turn away the work of Almighty God. The Lord hasset His hand to carry out these greatprinciples which He has revealed, the establishing of the Zion of Godand the preparation for the comingof the Son of Man. What has been said about the mountains of Israelwill have its fulfillment. The judg-ments of God will follow in the earthin fulfillment of what has been said, and no power on earth can stay them.I am anxious, although my life has been preserved to this great age, I still am anxious that we as a peoplemay do our duty, may live our re-ligion, may keep the faith, may sowalk before the Lord that the HolyGhost may be our constant companion to lead us in the days that lie beforeus. This is my prayer and my desire,in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 Kanarra Feb ^March^ 1, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother:Having re-ceived a call from you to go on a mission, I write for further information as I do not know how long it takes to go from Salt Lake City ^to Sanfrancisco^ and would like to know some wheres near the price of fair. Am sorry to say I have but little means, but do not feel to shrink from duty, when called by those whose right it is to call.Under my circumstances in life I have been unable to work to gain the comforts of 
 gosple. When our Bishop asked me to go I thought they had to have a man to go in a few weeks and so I concsented but since I have had time to think it apeares to me my time would be lost if I went as I am now, and for that reason I ask to be excused. My father said he would be glad to help me to go to school, I have a wife and one baby, and but little means to go on, and forthat reason I think while I have a shance to go to school with out charges I ought to go, and if I hcan I will be prepared to do a good work when I go on my mission. Hoping to hear from you by retun mail, I remain as ever your brotherW. M. Riddle.Culbert King, Bp[unknown writer] Let him go to school & keep his mis[sion] in [mind] as soon as pos. afterschool
