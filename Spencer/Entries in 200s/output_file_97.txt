Though hast  clothed the Naked and fed the hungry and the God of  heaven will feed thee forever and forever. and the desire  of thy heart shall be granted thee in Gods own time. No weapon shall prosper against thee for thou art  sealed up unto the Lord. think it not strange when  you see many fall away and some of the Elders of this Church for the scriptures must be fulfilled many are called but few are chosen thou hast desired to  see this day, and when thou goest to thine inheritants  I will go with thee and take care of thee. one thing I  say unto thee. thou must not think because some  will fall away from their stedfastness that they were not called to their office. Some have desired  their office and some will fall by their desires, see thou desire no one thing but that which is given thee from the father if the Father gives a desire there will be the assurance of the gift, and as desire incr- eases there will be the greater love to the servants  of God this is the mark the servants of God have to go by and is a mark Satan cannot give be patient  in all things and humble in thy walk before the world and the Lord will make thee a blessing to thy friends and  enemies they tears have come up before the Lord and are more in number than thine enemies, thy tears  shall condemn many if they do not repent.

ENDENTRY October 19, 1840 ~ Monday   19th FIGURE I wrote two letters one to Elder Richards and the other to Elder Kington. I spent several hours in visiting the British Museum the acou nt of which is as follows: A Visit to the BRITISH MUSEUM London Oct 19th 1840. In company with Elder G A. Smith I purchased a Book from which  I make an extract of the following SYNOPSIS  of the contents of the BRITISH MUSEUM  FORTY SECOND EDITION London 1840. ("The foundation of the British Museum originat ed with the will of Sir Hans Sloane, who accu- mulated, in addition to a considerable Library of  Books and Manuscripts, the largest collections of  objects of natural History and works of art of his time.  These he directed should be offoered after his death, which took place in 1753, to Parliament. The offer  was accepted: and the Act of 26 Geo. II., which directed  the purchase, also directed the purchase of the Harleian Library of Manuscrips and enacted  that the Cottonian Library which had been given to the Government for public use in the  reign of Will. III., should, with these, form  one General collection. blank In the Spring of 1754 the mansion in Great Russell Street,  then known as Montagu House, was purchased  as a repository for the whole. Between 1755 and 1759 the different collections were removed into it, and it was determined that the new instit- ution should bear the name of BRITISH -  MUSEUM - Till the arival of the Egypt- ian Antiquities from Alexandri in 1801  Montague House was competant to the reception  of all its acquisitions. The Egyptian Monumen- ts, most of them too massive a character for  the floors of a private Dwelling, first suggested the necessity of an additional building, rendered still  more indispensible by the purchase of the Townley  Marbles in 1805. A Gallery adequate to the reception of both was completed in 1807; after  which, although the Trustees meditated, and had ENDENTRY plans drawn for new buildings, none were under- taken till 1823, when, upon the donation from his Majesty King George IV. of the Library collected by King George III., the Government ordered drawings  to be prepared for the erection of an entire no Museum a portion of one wing of which was to be occupied  by the recently acquired Library. This wing on the  Eastern side of the then Northern. and a part of the  western compartment of a Projected Square have  been since completed. The Townly Gallery at pre- sent joins on to the centere of the western compartment and Montagu House, the old building of the Museum,  continued to form the general front. On entering  the Gate of the Museum from Great Russel Street, a  quadrangle presents itself, with an Ionic colonnade on the South side, and the main building on the North; the  side buildings being allotted for the dwellings of  the officers. The house itself measures two hun- dred and sixteen feet in length, and fifty seven in hight to the top of the cornic. The architect, Peter Puget,  a native of Marseilles, and an artist of the first eminence in his time, was sent over from Paris by Ralph, first  Duke of Montagu, for the sole purpose of construc ting this Splended mansion. It was the repetition  of a building first designed in 1674 by Dr. Hook, which was destroyed by fire in 1686.") I again visited this Museum and went through evry appartment of it on the 9th of Dec in company  with Elders H. C. Kimball, The forego- ing account, of this Museum is ownly its origen, they have continued to build and add thereto untill it covers  or surrounds five acres of ground, and it now cont ains a vast number of rooms sum of them sev eral hundred feet in length, and this Museum now con tains the greatest variety of curiosityies of evry  kind name and nature Ancient and Modern, consisting  of all Natural History, Beast;, Fowl, Birds, Fish, Serpe- nts, ores, minerals, Antiquities, of all nations -  Sculptures, Mummies, hieroglyphics and Papyrus. Though I felt interested in a visit to evry apart- ment of this Museum which is considered the grea- test collection in the world and open to the free  inspection of the publick, yet I felt the more  deeply interested in that Part called the gallery of Antiquities esspecially the Egyptian, The  Antiquities consists mostly of Greek. Roman Jewish  and Egyptian. and some british, Among the vast ENDENTRY number of sculptures, was Trajan  The God Ammon. Shakespere, Huercules, Appollo,  Thalia, Diana, Homer, Minerva, and  hundreds of others, An article called the  Portland Vase is the choiceest article of any  one thing among the Antiquities as it is the ownly thing of the Kind known in the world, This celeb rated Barberini Vase was for more than two centuries the principal ornament of the Barberini Palace  it was found about the middle of the sixteenth century two miles and a half from Rome in the road  leading from Fraseati. FIGURE The material of which the vase is formed is glass, the figures which are  executed in relief are of a beautiful opake white and the ground is in perfect harmony with the figure and of a dark transparent blue. This superb specimen of greek art was deposited in the British Museum in 1810 by the Duke of Portland. Among the  Egyptian Antiquities, is a large number of Tombs  coffins, mumies, Hieroglyphics and Papyri enough  if translated into the English language to make one hundred volums as large as the Bible. I felt  more interested in this part than any thing I  saw as they were from three to four thousand  years of age, and would no doubt if translated  have revealed many glorious things Sacred and  historical concerning the early ages of the world  Abram and the Prophets andc. Having formed an intimate acquaintance with one of the over- seers of the gallery of Antiquities, He explained  many things to us concerning these things  which were interesting unto us, we saw a Tomb said to be that of Allexander the great, and among many thousands of other things  was Napolian Boneparte private snuff box  which cost 300 guineas, A piece of the Tower  of Babel, many lamps from Babylon, and many  relics from the ruins of Hercuilaneum and  Pompei.

To me it was a day that satisfy ed mine eyse in many respects. when we arose  in the morning we still found strong head winds  which soon increased to a great storm and tempest  which scenery I have not language to describe the  sails were close reefed or taken in as soon as pos- sible, it took 16 men to cloose reef the main top sail  the tempest was now raging with all power the  sea piling up into mountains, the ship mountain the  waves and billows and pitching into the valleys and rocking  tremendiously and shiping seas occasionly, in the midst  of this seenery the cry of help was herd in our  cabin I rushed to the scene and found the ropes giving  way and breaking which held the whole mass of baggage  which was piled up between decks, consisting of  heavy trunks, chests, boxes and barrels which if once  liberated from their confinement would with one  ENDENTRY surge be hurled with all their force into the births  of the men, women, and children which would endanger  the lives of all on seeing the foundation of this mass  give way Elder W.

On seeing that we could not esca- pe it Elder Richards flung himself close under the  Bulwarks and the body of the wave went clear over  him without wetting him but little but as I could  not take the same advantage I flung myself  upon the deck and held upon the fast seat whare I  remained untill the sea passed over me and left me  drenched in the surge I now thought it time for  me to leave my seat of observation for the day  and go below as I was thoroughly wet with salt water I went to bed but did not sleep but little for  the ship rocked at a dredful rate boxes, barrels,  and tines were tumbling from one end of the  cabin to the other.

We sent about two bushels of the Times  and Seasons to the post office to send to our patrons I received 3 papers from Mr Ezra Carter jr  which contained much intelligence of various kinds  It is truly interesting edifying and glorious to conte- mplate the great and mighty work which God has  set his hand to esstablish in these last days by revealing  the fullness of the everlasting gospel as recorded in  the Book of mormon and esstablishing his church and ENDENTRY kingdom as at the beginning which is according to the  order of heaven with seers prophets, Apostles, Elders  Priests, Bishops, Teachers, Revelation, Administering  of Angels gifts, graces, Knowledge, wisdom, tongues  healings andc. andc. Truly the Lord has raised up Joseph  the seer of the seed of Abraham out of the loins  of ancient Joseph, and is now clothing him with mighty  power and wisdom and knowledge which is more clear- ly manifest and felt in the midst of his intimate friends than any other class of mankind. The Lord is  Blessing Joseph with Power to reveal the mysteries of  the kingdom of God; to translate through the Urim  and Thummim Ancient records and Hyeroglyphics as  old as Abraham or Adam, which causes our  hearts to burn within us while we behold their glori- ous truths opened unto us. Joseph the Seer  has presented us some of the Book of Abraham which  was written by his own hand but hid from the  knowledge of man for the last four thousand years but  has now come to light through the mercy of God.

Sermon of Joseph the Seer  A large assembly of Saints gather together at  an early hour to hear a discours deliverd upon the  subject of Baptism by Joseph the Seer, but as a  young child was dead and his corpes presented in the  assembly it called forth many remarks from The  speaker upon death and the resurrection which were  in the highest degree interesting ink color change and his remarks  upon Baptism was truly glorious to the believer  in Jesus Christ. The following is a brief synopsis  of some of the items presented in the discours  The Speaker read the 14 ch Revelations. And sayes  "we have again the warning voice sounded in our midst  which shows the uncertainty of human life. And  in my leasure moments I have meditated upon the  subject, and asked the question Why is it that infants  innocent children are taken away from us, esspeci- ally those that seem to be most intelligent beings"  Answer "This world is a vary wicked world and  it is a proverb that the world grow weaker and  wiser, but if it is the case the world grows more wicked  and corrupt. In the early ages of the world a rich- eous man and a man of God and intelligence had a better  chance to do good to be received and believed that than at  the present day, but in these days such a man is  much opposed and persecuted by most of the inh- abitants of the earth and he has much sorrow to pass  through, hence the Lord takes many away even in  infancy that they may escape the envy of man,  the sorrows and evils of this present world and they were  two pure and to lovly to live on Earth. Therefore if  rightly considered we have, instead of mourning we  have reason to rejoice, as they are deliverd from evil  and we shall soon have them again. What chance  is their for infidelity when we are parting with  our friends almost daily none at all. The  infidel will grasp at evry straw for help untill  death stares him in the face and then his infidelity  ENDENTRY takes its flight for the realities of the eternal  world are resting upon him in mighty power and when evry earthly support and prop fails him, he  then sensibly feels the eternal truths of the imm- ortality of the Soul. *Also the doctrin of Baptizi- ng children or sprinkling them or they must  welter in Hell is a doctrin not true not supported  in Holy writ and is not consistant with the character  of God. The moment that children leave this world  they are taken to the bosom of Abraham. The  ownly difference between the old and young dying  is one lives longer in heaven and Eternal light  and glory than the other and was freed a little sooner  from this miserable wicked world. Notwithstanding  all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it and mourn the loss but we do not mourn as those  without hope. ink color change * (We should take warning and not wait  for the death bed to repent) As we see the infant  taken away by death, so may the youth and middle aged  as well as the infant suddenly be called into  eternity. Let this then proove as a warning to all  not to procrastinate repentance or wait till a death  bed, for it is the will of God that man should repent  and serve him in health and in the strength and power  of his mind in order to secure his blessings and not wait  untill he is called to die.  "My intention (says the speaker)  was to have treated upon the subject of Baptism,  But having a case of death before us, I thought it  proper to refer to that subject. I will now however  say a few words upon that subject ^Baptism^ as intended God has made certain decreas which are fixed and unalt- erable, for instance God set the sun, the moon,  the stars in the heavens, and given them their laws  conditions, and bounds which they cannot pass except  by his command, they all move in perfect harmony  in there sphere and order and are as wonders, lights and  signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds which  it cannot pass God has set many signs in the earth  as well as in heaven for instance the oaks of the forest  the fruit of the tree, the herd of the field all bear a  sign that seed hath been planted there. ENDENTRY to light, iniquity must be purged out, then the veil will  be rent and the blessings of heaven will flow down  they will roll down like the Mississippi River. This  Society shall have power to command Queens in their  midst, I now deliver it as a prophecy that before ten  years shall roll round the Queens of the earth shall  come and pay their respects to this Society, they shall  come with their millions and shall contribute of their  abundance for the relief of the poor - if you will  be pure, nothing can hinder.  After this instruction you will be responsible  for your own sins, it is an honor to save yourselves  all are Responsible to save themselves.  Prest. Smith after reading from the above  mentioned chapt. continued to give instruction respect ing the order of God, as established in the church,  saying every one should aspire only to magnify his  own office andc.  He then commenced reading the 13th. chapt  "Though I speak with the tongues of men andc"; and said  dont be limited in your views with regard to your  neighbors virtues, but be limited towards your  own virtues, and not think your selves more righte- ous than others, you must enlarge your souls to- wards others, if you would do like Jesus, and carry your  fellow creatures to Abrahams bosom.  He said he had manifested long suffering  and we must do so too - Prest Smith then read  "Though I have the gift of prophecy" andc, He then  said though one should be come mighty, do great  things, overturn mountains andc and should then turn  to eat and drink with the drunken; all former  deeds would not save him, but he would go  to destruction!.  As you increase in innocence and virtue  as you increase in goodness let your hearts  expand, let them be enlarged towards others you must be long suffering and bear with the  faults and errors of mankind How precious  are the souls of men! The female part of  community are apt to be contracted in their  views. You must not be contracted,  ENDENTRY but you must be liberal in your feelings.  Let this Society teach now to act towards  husbands to treat them with mildness and affect- ion. When men is borne down with trouble  when he is perplexed, if he can meet a smile,  an argument, if he can meet with mildness  it will calm down his soul and soothe his feel- ings, when the mind is going to despair  it needs a solace.  This society is to get instruction thro'  the order which God has established, thro' the  medium of those appointed to lead and I now  turn the Key to you in the name of God and this  society shall rejoice and knowledge and intelligence  shall flow down from this time, this is  the beginning of better days to this Society.  When you go home never give a cross  word, but let kindness charity and love, crown  your works hence forward. dont envy sinners,  have mercy on them, God will destroy them Let your labors be mostly confined to those  around you in your own circle; as far as  knowledge is concerned, it may extend to  all the world, but your administrations  should be confined to the circle of your  immediate accquaintance, and more  especially to the members of the Society.  Those ordained to lead the society,  are authorised to appoint the different  offices as the circumstances shall require.  If any have a matter to reveal,  let it be in your own tongue, do not indul ge too much in the gift of tongues, or the  devil will take advantage of the innocent.  You may speak in tongues for your own  comfort but I lay this down for a  rule that if any thing is taught by the  gift of tongues, it is not to be received  for doctrine.  Prest Smith then offered instruct ion respecting the propriety of females  ENDENTRY administering to the sick by the laying  on of hands, said it was according to  revelation andc, said he was never placed  in similar circumstances and never had  given the same instruction.  He closed his instructions by ex- pressing his satisfaction in improving  the opportunity.  The spirit of the Lord was pour'd  out in a very powerful manner, never  to be forgotten by those present on that  interesting occasion.  FIGURE Copied by John P. McEwan Augst 27th 1844  Testimony of Mother Lucy Smith.  Mother Smith rose and said she was glad the time had come that iniquity could be detected  and reproach thrown off from the heads of the  church. We come into the church to be saved  that we may live in peace and sit down in the  kingdom of heaven. If we listen to, and circulate  every evil report, we shall idly spend the  time which should be appropriated to the  reading of the scriptures, the Book of Mor- mon - we must remember the words of  Alma pray much at morning, noon and evening - feed the poor andc, She said she  was old could not meet with the Society  but few times more, and wished to leave her  testimony that the book of mormon is  the book of God - that Joseph Smith is  a man of God, a prophet of the Lord  set apart to lead the people. If we  observe his words it will be well with  us; if we live righteously on earth, it  ENDENTRY will be well with us in Eternity.

We spent  the afternoon in visiting the town of Woolwich, which  was truly interesting to me. We first visited the  Artillary and Marin Barracks, passed through and had a view  of their Drill and parade ground which I should judge to  be a mile squair it is the largest I ever saw. As cold as it  was their was a number of companies on parade and were  drilling new recruits, we saw many hundred cannon one  that measured 16 feet in length 3 1/2 diameter at the brich  and 2 at the mouth, we saw one horse company exercising.  We saw two soldiers buried under arms, the coffins  were let down into the grave side by side about an ounce of  dirt sprinkled upon them the Priest read the funeral  Prayers and Ceremony. A company of soldiers then fired three  rounds over their grave and retired. We next visited the Dock  and Prision yard, which is considerd one of the most interesting  Dock yards in the world. On passing through the gate in- to the yard we entered our names and residence on book, was  then conducted by Mr John Finsbury Policeman to all parts  and branches of business in the yard.
