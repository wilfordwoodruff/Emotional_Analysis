Between 1755 &amp; 1759 the different collections were removed into it, &amp; it was determined that the new instit- ution should bear the name of BRITISH -  MUSEUM - Till the arival of the Egypt- ian Antiquities from Alexandri in 1801  Montagu of all its acquisitions. The Egyptian Monumen- ts, most of them too massive a character for  the floors of a private Dwelling, first suggested the necessity of an additional building, rendered still  more indispensible by the purchase of the Townley  Marbles in 1805. A Gallery adequate to the reception of both was completed in 1807; after  which, although the Trustees meditated, &amp; had ENDENTRY  taken till 1823, when, upon the donation from his Majesty King George IV. of the Library collected by King George III., the Government ordered drawings  to be prepared for the erection of an entire no Museum a portion of one wing of which was to be occupied  by the recently acquired Library. This wing on the  Eastern side of the then Northern. &amp; a part of the  western compartment of a Projected Square have  been since completed.

On entering  the Gate of the Museum from Great Russel Street, a  quadrangle presents itself, with an Ionic colonnade on the South side, &amp; the main building on the North; the  side buildings being allotted for the dwellings of  the officers. The house itself measures two hun- dred &amp; sixteen feet in length, &amp; fifty seven in hight to the top of the cornic. The architect, Peter Puget,  a native of Marseilles, &amp; an artist of the first eminence in his time, was sent over from Paris by Ralph, first  Duke of Montagu, for the sole purpose of construc ting this Splended mansion. It was the repetition  of a building first designed in 1674 by Dr. Hook, which was destroyed by fire in 1686.") I again visited this Museum &amp; went through evry appartment of it on the 9 with Elders H. C.

This superb specimen of greek art was deposited in the British Museum in 1810 by the Duke of Portland. Among the  Egyptian Antiquities, is a large number of Tombs  coffins, mumies, Hieroglyphics &amp; Papyri enough  if translated into the English language to make one hundred volums as large as the Bible.

Sermon of Joseph the Seer   an early hour to hear a discours deliverd upon the  subject of Baptism by Joseph the Seer, but as a  young child was dead &amp; his corpes presented in the  assembly it called forth many remarks from The  speaker upon death &amp; the resurrection which were  in the highest degree interesting ink color change &amp; his remarks  upon Baptism was truly glorious to the believer  in Jesus Christ. The following is a brief synopsis  of some of the items presented in the discours   "we have again the warning voice sounded in our midst  which shows the uncertainty of human life. And  in my leasure moments I have meditated upon the  subject, &amp; asked the question Why is it that infants  innocent children are taken away from us, esspeci- ally those that seem to be most intelligent beings"  Answer "This world is a vary wicked world &amp;  it is a proverb that the world grow weaker &amp;  wiser, but if it is the case the world grows more wicked  &amp; corrupt. In the early ages of the world a rich- eous man &amp; a man of God &amp; intelligence had a better  chance to do good to be received &amp; believed that than at  the present day, but in these days such a man is  much opposed &amp; persecuted by most of the inh- abitants of the earth &amp; he has much sorrow to pass  through, hence the Lord takes many away even in  infancy that they may escape the envy of man,  the sorrows &amp; evils of this present world &amp; they were  two pure &amp; to lovly to live on Earth. Therefore if  rightly considered  have reason to rejoice, as they are deliverd from evil  &amp; we shall soon have them again. What chance  is their for infidelity when we are parting with  our friends almost daily none at all. The  infidel will grasp at evry straw for help untill  death stares him in the face &amp; then his infidelity  ENDENTRY  world are resting upon him in mighty power &amp; when evry earthly support &amp; prop fails him, he  then sensibly feels the eternal truths of the imm- ortality of the Soul. *Also the doctrin of Baptizi- ng children or sprinkling them or they must  welter in  in Holy writ &amp; is not consistant with the character  of God. The moment that children leave this world  they are taken to the bosom of Abraham. The  ownly difference between the old &amp; young dying  is one lives longer in heaven &amp; Eternal light  &amp; glory than the other &amp; was freed a little sooner  from this miserable wicked world.
