Since that time he has been endeavoring to acquire the Maori language. But owing to his memory being so treacherous up to the present time he has not been able to construct a single sentence in Maori. And he has not been able to remember a passage of Scripture. Two weeks ago I received letters from him and the President of his DistrictJohn Ephraim Magleby  setting forth in plainness his condition. The natives are tired of him because he can neither speak in their language nor in English. They feel that he should be assisted by the Lord as he is His servant &amp;c. He therefore and his President (Elder J. E. Maggleby) think it best for him and the Mission that he return home. So in accordance with the re- quest I have released him to return home with Elder William Gardner on Nov 7 place in the Mission that I could place him to ad- vantage either to himself or the Mission.

I in com- pany with Elder Johnson were coming through what is known as the "ninety mile bush" when in turning one of the rocky cliffs we came upon a little waterfall trickling down the side of the mountain. The horse on which my companion was riding shied to one side and he, seeing its proximity to the rocky chasm, dismounted and the horse fell over a cliff some fifty feet high mid a great heap of boulders. And kept on bounding down the side of the mountain some three hundred feet. We at once went down and found him fastened in a thicket of underbrush. We at once cut him loose and after several feeble attempts he gained his feet. The blood was pouring from his nose and was bruised and scared all over.

In our council meetings we truly had a time never to be forgotten, for so great was the power and inspiration of God poured out upon us, that we shed tears of joy, and our hearts swelled within us for the goodness and loving kindness of our Heavenly Father thus bestowed upon us.  The saints of this district built a fine meeting house for the Conference, with seats, capable of holding three hundred people, the first house among ENDENTRY  expenses of the same, which we trust we will have  no great difficulty in obtaining.   obtaining prices for printing and binding, from the  leading establishments in New Zealand, we have  now received the same, and will here quote the  best terms received, from the "Star Office", in Auckland,  quite a large and reliable firm, having compositers that  understand Maori, which is a great advantage, the  prices quoted are for a book of 650 pages, size of leaf  5 x 7 inches, with good paper and type, a sample  of each they have furnished us, they say.   bound in leather as per sample herewith inclosed would  be £420.0.0d, for 1000 additional copies £150.0.0d  If found in cloth (sample inclosed)         thus you see, that by having the 3000 copies, they  will cost, in leather 3s-10d each or 95 cents, in cloth  3s-5d or 85 cents, these figures are 40 percent lower than  any others we have received, and from the most reliable establishment, and we think them very reasonable.   to be done, here or in Zion, we take pleasure in forward- ing to you the afore figures, and will now wait your ENDENTRY  seats; it was filled to its upmost capacity during the meeting of Conference, and their dusky faces beamed with joy as they listened to the inspired words of the  Servants of God, and those that had the privilege of speaking.

Ample accommodation were made for feeding and caring for the whole com- pany of not less then four hundred souls.  Quite a number of these w listen to the truth.  It is no small affair to provide and care for a gathering of this kind, as all that come have to be fed during the time of their stay, by those who live at the place of gathering.  It is done by free will gifts, some making large presents of food; a non-member of the Church, brought a large van, drawn by four large horses some fifteen miles, containing a ton of flour, eight 40 lbs bags of sugar, a sack of rice, a box of tea, four sacks of shell fish, and a quantity of sweet and Irish potatoes.

This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of leading cheifs in attendance, yet they were humble as children and one with the Saints in all things. And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvment the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal apperanance and deportment, and willingness to hearken unto counsel.   and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav- ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori, to distribute amongst them.

I am pleased to State, that wh- ere-ever we go we have the priveledge  of holding meetings and beering testim- ones to the truth of the Gospel, and  warning the people of the great  day of God, for it is seldom that I  do not hold from eight to ten meetings  a weak and often more then that.

When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was that means nescessary to carry on this work should be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this has been the case from the commencement until this time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become due just enough to pay them has been forthcoming, and for the last payment the Saints have exceeded our most sanguine hopes or expectations.

Realizing at the same ENDENTRY    ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were  rejoicing in our annual ^conference^ which has just closed at  this place, and at which were in attendance  thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at- tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts,  except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicings  of all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly  ^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many were  the words of inspiration that were spoken during  the five days that we were together, two of which  were occupied by the Elders in council, in which we  were one, and all melted to tears of joy, so great  was the spirit of God that was in our midst causing  each one to arise to his feet and praise the living God:  for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify  that He is our Father and that we are His delegated  sons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every  s was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were  led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon  this island to labor among this benighted and sinful  people, a portion of the House of Israel.

And many, very many others would receive the  same if it were not for the power exercised by the  chiefs o will sooner or later be broken down so that every hon- est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change  in this respect  the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent  with their feelings of chiefship, or desires to keep  others in subjection. This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of  leading chiefs in attendance, yet they were humble  as children, and one with the Saints in all things.  And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvement the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal  appearance and deportment, and willingness to  hearken unto counsel.   and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav- ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in  Maori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil- dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres- ents, then were this people to receive that holy book.  And although nearly all present had paid from five ENDENTRY  his sentence. No wonder at the rabid element getting more than mad. We sincerely hope that they will not be able to trump up any other charge against him, so as to retain him in their power. For we feel with you that he with the leaders  of Israel, are needed much to labor in the midst of the people and give unto the Saints the word of the Lord, guiding and directing them in the  path they ought to walk How gladly the Saints will re- ceive their words of council and instruction after having been for such a long time excluded from their midst. We feel that ENDENTRY  and were entitled to receive copies without any fur- ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that  about eighty paid for their books five shillings each  saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their  desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the  final payment that there might be a fund on hand  for the publishing of other works, as they desire to  receive all that God has revealed for the guidance  and blessing of His children. When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises  and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was  that means necessary to carry on this work should  be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this  has been the case from the commencement until this  time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become  due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming,  and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded  our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this  a statement will be furnished showing the receipt and disbursements in balance on hand which I feel  will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of  £80-12-5, we have collected £18-3-6 for the sale of books  making a total of £98-15-11 so that all that is lacking  is about fifty pounds.

From statisti- cal report inclosed you will see that 513 have been  baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743  which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre- vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or- ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools; which  with the large sum of money raised for the printing of  the Book of Mormon, and that important work having  been nearly completed, we are filled with thanks giving  and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do  know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine  guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we  do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful- ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty.  But by His aid and blessings, we have sought to m nify our most high and holy callings as embassa- dors of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real- ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain- ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.   that the prospects for the future are very encouraging  indeed, and by the aid that we feel the Book of Mormon  will be in aiding in the spreading of the Word of God,  we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls.

Five of the six Elders that left in  March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were  in attendance at our conference, and have now  been assigned to their fields of labor.

"Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommend to succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it will be necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Australasia be sent from here?"  We will here state, that we have two Elders that in my judgment would be suitable to fill this possition, namely Ogden, who has been here 1 1/2 years.  And Clifton, Ida- ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of that Ward, he has been here one year the 23 next month, they are both good men, and wou- ld do all that laid in their power to further the work of God in this land.  I fear how- ever that the first named would not be able to endure so much horse back riding as is required of the president of this mission, as he is enclined to be stout and riding to much on horse back seem to hurt him.   they were both appointed to preside over verry important districts, those that had ENDENTRY  such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath- breaking etc., which would spread from one end of the Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.   are exceedingly fond of all sports and a as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., and it would not require but a small exertion on their part to follow after all such things.

I in company with Elders Nye  and Cutler, have been down to  the extreme north end of the  island, visiting all of the native  villages, and have had the priv- ilege of bearing our testimony to  many who had never before seen  a Mormon Elder.

The newspapers are all  commenting upon it, and we are every- where plied with questions concerning  it.
