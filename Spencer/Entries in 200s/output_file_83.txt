Mangapai  Nov 1st 1887.  President Wilford Woodruff and Presiding Authorities  Dear Beloved Brethren:  Under the Divine blessings of God we are preserved in health to again address a few lines to you. And in doing so a fervent prayer ascends to God our Eternal Father that they may find you in the enjoyment of perfect health, and every blessing necessary for you to enjoy, to fit you for your great responsibilities and arduous labors. As also a sincere wish for your freedom and prosperity. Realizing, to some extent, how eagerly your movements are watched by the enemies of God's Kingdom. Realizing also how wonderfully you have been preserved in the past.  We feel sure it would be very gratifying to you if you could hear the many fervent and earnest prayers that are offered up to the Throne of Grace, by our dusky friends all over the Island, for God to bless, sustain and preserve you. For they, the Maories, have great reverence and love for the Prophets and Apostles of God living upon the Earth to day.  We have had translated into the Maori language the communication from Prest. Woodruff to the Saints of God throughout the world of August last. And it has been read to the Saints and caused them to rejoice.

My Dearest Beloved Brethren Upon my arrival at this place, after a four months trip to the South and west part of this Island. I was pained indeed to receive with my home mail, on the 27th  Ulto, the sad and Sorrowful intellegence of the Death of poor aged, avenerable and dearly beloved Prophet President John Taylor; realizing full well that ^at^ this critical period in our history that his valuable Services could it be spared. But the Lord who controls the destinies of men and nations will not Permit any thing to occur to ret- ard the progress of His work, and real- ize also that He can and will raise up ano- ther as great, good and noble as our beloved Prophet who has been So recently called to labor in another Sphere, to carry on His work on the earth;  Yet with all these assurances and the knowledge that we have of the mercies and loving kindness of our Heavenly Father we cannot help but mourn fo the noble and illustrious dead, we, indeed, would be more than mortal if we felt otherwise;  But thanks be to God we have the hope and the assurance, that if we conduct our lives as becom- eth L. D. Saints that we will again meet and clasp hands with that noble Son of God, and that too where there will be no longer the Power of darkness to rule over and bind us in our endeavors ENDENTRY Prophet, Seer and Revelator.  We had not contemplated writing to you by this mail, but for the returning home of Elder David Haight by the same steamer that takes this to you.  Elder Haight came here in comp- any with Elder Andrew Corry in January last. Since that time he has been endeavoring to acquire the Maori language. But owing to his memory being so treacherous up to the present time he has not been able to construct a single sentence in Maori. And he has not been able to remember a passage of Scripture. Two weeks ago I received letters from him and the President of his DistrictJohn Ephraim Magleby  setting forth in plainness his condition. The natives are tired of him because he can neither speak in their language nor in English. They feel that he should be assisted by the Lord as he is His servant andc. He therefore and his President (Elder J. E. Maggleby) think it best for him and the Mission that he return home. So in accordance with the re- quest I have released him to return home with Elder William Gardner on Nov 7th. There is no place in the Mission that I could place him to ad- vantage either to himself or the Mission. He feels bad at having to return home in this condition and states that he has fasted, prayed and wept over his con- dition. But finding no change for the better concluded he had better take this course and return home where ENDENTRY to do good, but where all will be peace harmony and love, where we can enjoy that Precious boon Liberty! and where Satan will be bound, and those who are taking Such a conspicuous Part in bringing the trials of to day upon the People of God, will be reaping their reward, they indeed will be objects of Pity when they get their just deserts for bringing So much trouble upon the chosen people of God,  There is no doubt in my mind but that all Israel would not have been called to mourn So Soon, had it not been for the Persecutions brought to bear against the leaders of Israel which forced them into exile.  He indeed was a double martyr and died a victim to this last vindict- ive and relentless raid which we are at Present Subject to;  We are going to hold Suitable Services thr^ough^out this Mission on next Sunday the 4th inst, in affectionate rememberance of our deceased Prophet, The Elders and Saints all feel to mourn with the rest of the People of God, and offer up earnest and united Prayers to Him that you my dear Brethren may be abundantly qualified and Sustained to carry on the work and Shoulder the responsibility that now rests upon you.  By the Same mail that brought me the news of the death of President Taylor, also brought the Painful news of the death of my Son George Francis who was at work on the Manti Temple. He was a good Son and died firm in the faith, he was taken Sick verry Suddenly, and only lived four days after, ENDENTRY he felt he could do some good for himself and the cause of God. Elder Haight had some means to help pay his passage home. I have loaned him £15.0.0 to make up the amount he was deficient with in- structions to call at the Historian's office and arrange for the sending the amount to me Not knowing how you would wish his fare paid under the circumstances  Elder William Gardner has performed a very successful mission of three and one half years and re- turns home in honor with my blessings and those of the Elders and Saints. He has presided over the Waikato District from its organization, which District, at the late Conference held at Rakaumangamanga, on the banks of the beautiful large Waikato River, was divided into three owing to its immense size. The following is the division. H. J. Manning President and Alma Hayes Traveling Elder in the Waikato, Boyd Stewart Traveling Elder in the Elias Johnson President and Bay of Island. I am thankful to be able to state that there is quite an encouraging prospect in all three of these Districts to reap a rich harvest of souls. During the past eight months there has been added to the Church in this District by Baptism and Blessing 108 souls. Quite a number have been baptized quite recently and two new Branches organized. I feel that with the blessings of God a number of new Branches will be added  ENDENTRY and leaves a babe, This is quite a blow to me, but the Lords will be done in this as inall other matters,  Since having mailed my last to Presidents Geo. Q. Cannon containing the news of our fellow laborer B. W. Young's Death, I have received a letter from them bearing date of June 24th  and the inspired words therein contained was most welcomely recei- ved and read, it is indeed verry grati- fying to know that the Heavens are nearer to us as a People than they have ever been before and that the Lord continues to give unto His inspired Servants, Knowledge and wisdome from on high,  It was also gratifying to hear that the time seemed to be an opportune one for Utah to again knock at the door of Statehood, and that Prospects were so favorable and bright for her appear to be listened to and granted, the Lord grant that it may be so and that we may have a little choice in the matter of who Shall administer the law unto us. The laws how- -ever unjust we may think them if administered by men, the choice of the People and administered with equality and justice will be quite a God given boon to Suffering Zion.  On my return from my travels in the Southern Part of the Island I found Elders Sandra Sanders, as also Sister Katie in the enjoyment of good health, and enjoying their labors upon the translation of the Book of Mormon,  I am thankful to State that they have translated up to  ENDENTRY this summer.  Elder H. J. Sears has been released from the Waikato District and appointed to labor in the M. S. Marriott. We feel that the harvest is great and the laborours are few Elder Wellington on the 1st of October for home going by way of England. Spring weather is now dawning upon us and it will enable the Elders to get among the people with much greater ease, as the roads, in some parts are almost impassable during our wet weather.  An intelligent young man by the name of John Barton, a half caste, was baptized about three months ago. He has a good English education and has been employed by the Government as interpreter and translator. He man- ifests great interest in the work of God, and states his willingness to assist in the translation of the Book of Mormon free of charge. This I consider as quite providential, as we have been quite un- decided who to get to assist the Elders in going over the work for the last time previous to writing the manuscript for the printer, which work will com- mence about the 1st of December.  The health of the Elders and Sisters laboring here continues good and they all manifest great earnestness in their labors. As a gen- eral rule are acquiring the Maori language quite readily ENDENTRY the three hundredth Page of the precious book, and are laboring verry faithfully for the completion of the work.  The Maori's are verry anxious to have the work published, so that they can read its Sacred Pages, and are donating freely and librating of their means to Support the brethern while thus engaged, and look forward with great anxiety when they can read of the dealings of God with their fore- fathers.  The health of the Elders is good with the exception of Elder H. J. Sears, the last I heard from him he was not enjoying the best of health.  Since my last letter to you there has been no marked changes, there is a few being added to the Church all the time. And the Elders con- tinus to Labor with an earnestness and zeal that is quite commendible.  We ever Pray for your Success and happiness and a rich flow of the Spirit of God to attend you.  With much love and best wishes to all, in which Elders E. Johnson and Katie joins.  I remain your Brother in the great course of truth Wm Paxman ENDENTRY Since last writing you I have attended Conference in the A. W. Harper and Elder A. Bullock with the Saints rejoicing in the work of God. We there had a time long to be remembered  There was an incident that occurred on our way that I think worthy of note. I in com- pany with Elder Johnson were coming through what is known as the "ninety mile bush" when in turning one of the rocky cliffs we came upon a little waterfall trickling down the side of the mountain. The horse on which my companion was riding shied to one side and he, seeing its proximity to the rocky chasm, dismounted and the horse fell over a cliff some fifty feet high mid a great heap of boulders. And kept on bounding down the side of the mountain some three hundred feet. We at once went down and found him fastened in a thicket of underbrush. We at once cut him loose and after several feeble attempts he gained his feet. The blood was pouring from his nose and was bruised and scared all over. In four and one half hours we again gained the road and proceeded twelve miles farther that night. We attribute it to the hand of God and His Divine wactchcare over His Servants in the discharge of their duties  It will be about two months before I return to Gisborne as I desire to accompany Elders Taupo Lake and  ENDENTRY surrounding country as there is a good prospect for  a great work being done there. Elders Wm. Gardner, George Romney Jr who I am now with join me in sending kind love to you and in praying God to bless you in your high and holy calling  I remain your Brother in the great cause of Truth.

My Dear Brethren:  We have received this day two very  interesting letters, one bearing date of August 2nd from Presidents  Geo. Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith, the other from President Woodruff,  bearing date of August 16th;  and I now hasten to acknowledge  the receipt of the same, for, the Lord being willing, we desire to leave  on Monday morning for a visit to the North part of the Island and  while thus traveling in Maoridom there is but little convenience or  time for corresponding.  We were delighted with the contents of your letters, and can  say Amen to all the words spoken concerning the greatness and no- bility of character of our deceased leader and Prophet; but as you say  his biography is interwoven with the history of this dispensation, and  it is unnecessary for me to enlarge on his many noble qualities of  heart and mind, all of which are so widely known, and inasmuch  also as I wrote last mail my feelings to you regarding his death.  We were much surprised and amused at the audacity, and  brazen cheek of Uncle Sam in demanding $4,000,00000 of the Church. And for what? Is the Nation in a state of bankruptcy and do they  wish to fill up their coffers with the hard earnings of the people  of God whom they have driven and robbed before and some of  whom they have killed? It seemes as though this step on the part of  the Nation is too glaring an act for the people of the United States even  to look upon without a feeling of insecurity for themselves and their  denominations; for if they can thus rob us, they can in like man- ner rob them, should they happen to fall under the displeasure of  an Edmond or a Tucker. But we do not fear the result, for we know  that the Lord is on our side, and we have every thing to encourage  us. This step against the work of God will, as has been the lot of all  others, result in the complete overthrow of our enemies and the fur- therence of the cause they are seeking to destroy.  We were thankful to hear that the People's Party came out and  did their duty at the polls to the defeating of our Liberal candidates  We think it high time that the Saints were arroused from the lethargy ENDENTRY that they have fallen into and be awakened to their duties in  political as well as ecclesiastical matters, for they should have  learned by the sad experiences of the past who are their friends, and  that there is no movement adopted or sanctioned by the leaders  of Israel but that which is for their good.  We were rejoiced to hear of the safe arrival of Elder Correy. The draft that you mentioned of $600.00 came tafe safe to hand this mail  to defray the passage expenses of Elder Correy and others, but am sor- ry to say that it was drawn on the bBank of Sydney N. S. W., which will cause some delay and expense. All other drafts  that have been sent have been on the Union Bank of Gis- borne.  Since writing you, Blyth in  Australia that he has received from Brother Correy's the £30 that  he borrowed for Elder Correy's return fare; I therefore shall use the  ammount necessary to pay the £21 borrowed at Auckland for his  "saloon" passage and hold remainder subject to your orders. I wrote  you in a previous letter that Elder Blyth would not return until  next Spring, as he desires to accompany some saints who will emi- grate at that time.  I desire again to mention the progress being made in the trans- lation of the Book of Mormon by Elders Sanders, feel- ing greatly encouraged, as they have now got 374 pages completed;  and if all is well and by the blessings of God, they anticipate  finishing the work by the first of December next ready for going  over it a second time and rewriting the manuscript for printing  desiring to have it ready for the printer's hands by our next Gen- eral Conference in April. We are already enquiries of several  firms concearning their terms for printing, binding, etc., that we  may be able to lay the same before you in time to receive your  counsel and instruction concerning the same.  Since writing my last letter to you there has been no  marked change in the Mission. The reports received from the  Elders presiding over the various districts are to the effect that,  generally, the Saints are feeling and doing well; but there are  however, in all the districts therose who give way to their former  loose lives, being overcome by adultery, which, I am sorry to  say, is the leading sin in their midst.  The health of the Elders is good so far as I know. Elder  England.  (over) ENDENTRY Camebridge Waikato. N. Z. November 25th 1887  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear beloved Brother  Today on my arrival at this place, I received your most welcome and interesting letter of the 13th of October, which had been forwarded from Gisborn  to me. I am not able to discribe the joy it afforded me in reading the contents of the same, to hear direct from the leaders of Gods' Kingdom upon the Earth, in relation to the interest and progress of the same, and of the welfare of Gods insp- ired serveants in these trying and per- ilous times, what a time of rejoiceing it must have been to you, as also to the Saints, to have you with them at the late Confrence, if only for one meeting, after such, a long time of seclusion, we were indeed sorry to learn that you had been so unwell ENDENTRY and Elder William Gardner in November.

God grant that it is not far in the distance, if it will bring about his great purposes, but in all things Fathers will be done.  We were thankfull to know that Elder Corry has arrived home safe and in impr- oved health, as also to learn that Elder Slater had arrived with the corpse of Elder B. YW. Young, and that you approved of the course we took in the same. the Draft that you mentioned to defray the expences occured, arrived ENDENTRY all right, and the Savings Bank has been instructed to forward his money to his Father.  Your instructions concerning the care to be used in the revission of the Book of Mormon secureing the best native talant for the purpose, will be strictly carried out.  We are thankfull to be able to announce to you that they are now ready to com^m^ence on the revis- sion haveing just finished the translation for the first time, in which they have been greatly blessed of the Lord.  We rejoice much to learn of the frequent meetings of the Apostles, and of the good health, and spirits they are in possession of.  On the 11th inst I had the pleasure of meeting Elders Joseph. L.

I am also sorry as we are quite short of Maori linquest, he had just been appointed to labor in the Mahia district under President M. S. Marriott to endeavour to open up a new part of the country. I have not learned the particulars receiveing only a short dispatch from him, so do not know in relation to his returning fare weather it has been sent to him or not, if I have to borrow the money for him, I will arr- ange for him to call at the office and report as there will not be time for me to Send further word, after hearing from him, by the next steamer  Since my last letter to you there has been a new Branch organized in this the Waikato district, with a good prospect of two if not  ENDENTRY three more being organized about Christmass, as our dusky friends set that time for being Baptised into the Church as they have arranged among themselves to all come into the Church about the same time, there are three villages of them a Short-distance apart, in company with Elder H.

Your kind welcome and interesting  letter of Nov 4th came duly to hand, and was read  with great interest, as the great distance we are  from head quarters, the leaders of God's people,  makes a letter doubly welcome. We were indeed  pained to learn of you having such a bad cold  and cough, a page torn desire that long ere ENDENTRY this you have been restored to perfect health and  strength to enable you to perform your many duties  and labors, that are required of you in your high  and holy calling.  Elder H. J. Sears was released to return  home by the December Steamer, but being disappoi nted in getting his passage money he did not leave  Auckland for home until the 2nd inst. The check  for $12500 for his return fare came safe and was  forwarded to him. $15000 is the amount that has  been sent for the previous Elders, until this time, which amount, if the church is able to continue sending is we think little enough as in most cases it takes  from $1000 to $2000 for them to reach Auckland,  where owing to the time the Steamers run, they have to  stay one week paying for their board, and in most every  instance their clothes are to shabby for them to return  home with.  We are thankful to state that Elders J. J. Jackson  for this Island, and S. D. Chipman  for Australia arrived at their fields of Labor in saf^e^ty,  having had a good and pleasant voyage.  The appointing of a receiver for the Church pro- perty, is indeed a new act in the great thieving  drama of this powerful nation. Surely the wisdom of  the wise has perished. It is very gratifying to us to  know that the feel page tornmes outside of the ENDENTRY Territory is more micld towards us, as also to learn that  there is not that vindictiveness on the part of the officials  in our Territory, although I see that many of our bre- -thern are being sent to prison.  Was sorry to hear of the unusual dry season coming,  so much severe sickness in the midst of the saints,  but I trust winter with her storms has before this  brought health to the homes of the saints.  We rejoiced to learn of the good health of the  Apostles, and do earnestly pray that it may contin- ue, that they may be the power in the hands of the  Lord required at this important time in the history  of the Church.  Your kind mention of the translation of the Book  of Mormon was thankfully received and we greatly  desire to be able to fully put your kind suggestions  into practice. At our last writing we thought that  we had secured a good native assistant to help in the  revision of the work, but for some cause he failed to  come makeing a very slimsy excuse, we also obtained  a promise from the second one, with the same results,  this did not discourage us in the least for we knew  that this was the Lords work and that He would  raise up some suitable person for us, which we are  thankful to say he has done in the person of  Henare Ptae, one that has a thorough knowledge  of the Maori language.

President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles,  Dear Beloved Brethern:  It is through a kind Providince, and a loving Father, that we are once more permitted to address you by letter; and in doing so feel to offer up a silent, but fervent prayer that it may reach its destination, and find you all, in the full enjoyment of health, and under the Divine care and protection of our ever kind and loving Father in Heaven; for when I reflect upon the present condition of your- selves and the Church, I see and feel that you need an increase of the power, wisdom and blessings of God; and to this end very earnest prayers are offered up daeily, yea hourly, by the Elders and saints in this far off land, the nethermost part of the earth. Fearing as we do, from the reports that reach us, from the various parts of Zion, that the saints have not harkened unto the voice of God through His in- spired prophets, in honoring God, and setting their houses in order, and purging out sin and iniquity from their midst, which if done would have given us unity and strength, so much so, that our enemies would not have the power over us that they have today. ENDENTRY Elders Sondra Sanders for with  his assistance have just finished the revision of the first  and second Books of Nephi, and we are most thankful  to state, that the (Henari Potae) pronounces the trans- lation as being very good indeed, far better then he  thought it could have been done and if this is the  case of the first part of their work, it will be  still better as they get further along, as they feel, that  by the blessings of God, they improved much in the  course of their labors, this mention is made to show  that they were blessed and inspired of the Lord for  the work they had been appointed and set apart to  perform. We feel that when the revision is completed  that there will be a very good and correct translation,  one that will be quite plain, and will convey to the  minds of the Maori people the meaning in the  same plainness and simplicity and with the  same accuracy, the glorious truths contained in  that devine record, that our edition does to us.  The Lord willing, we hope to have the revision com- pleted and the manuscript ready (or nearly so) for  the printers by our annual conference which will  commence on the 6th of April at Te Hauke, near  Napier, at which there will be present the leading  priesthood and saints of our dusky friends, (the  Maori's), we then desire to lay before them the  cost of printing and binding and adopt some ENDENTRY but thanks be to Our Heavenly Father, He has promised to give us a glorious victory; to raise up one Mighty and Strong, to deliver us, in the appointed time.

I am truly thankful to state that my health is good, and I am rejoicing much in my labors, but, feel a little weary in body through the great amount of labor that has been upon me during our conference, which commenced on Friday the 6th, and closed on Monday the 9th inst.    During the four days, twenty three meetings were held by the Saints, priesthood and Elders from Zion; there being twenty five in attendance, and two Sisters, as also a large gathering of the saints from the various parts of the Island; and above all the Lord Our God was with us by the power of His spirit; to the great rejoicing of all the saints, and Elders present.  In our council meetings we truly had a time never to be forgotten, for so great was the power and inspiration of God poured out upon us, that we shed tears of joy, and our hearts swelled within us for the goodness and loving kindness of our Heavenly Father thus bestowed upon us.  The saints of this district built a fine meeting house for the Conference, with seats, capable of holding three hundred people, the first house among ENDENTRY method of raising the means necessary to defray the  expenses of the same, which we trust we will have  no great difficulty in obtaining.  In a former letter, it was stated, that we were  obtaining prices for printing and binding, from the  leading establishments in New Zealand, we have  now received the same, and will here quote the  best terms received, from the "Star Office", in Auckland,  quite a large and reliable firm, having compositers that  understand Maori, which is a great advantage, the  prices quoted are for a book of 650 pages, size of leaf  5 x 7 inches, with good paper and type, a sample  of each they have furnished us, they say.  Our price for 2000 copies not more then 656 pages,  bound in leather as per sample herewith inclosed would  be £420.0.0d, for 1000 additional copies £150.0.0d  If found in cloth (sample inclosed)          2000 copies £385.0.0d     1000 additional copies £125.0.0d      thus you see, that by having the 3000 copies, they  will cost, in leather 3s-10d each or 95 cents, in cloth  3s-5d or 85 cents, these figures are 40 percent lower than  any others we have received, and from the most reliable establishment, and we think them very reasonable.  Not knowing where you would desire the publishing  to be done, here or in Zion, we take pleasure in forward- ing to you the afore figures, and will now wait your ENDENTRY the saints of this Island that has been furnished with seats; it was filled to its upmost capacity during the meeting of Conference, and their dusky faces beamed with joy as they listened to the inspired words of the  Servants of God, and those that had the privilege of speaking. During our meetings many expressed them- selves as being filled with joy and rejoicings for the things they had heard, and the power they had felt, and desired to be firm and steadfast unto the end for they knew it was the true Gospel, Ect.  During the whole of our conference there was nothing occured to mar our pleasure, or the peace of the company; all was love and good will.  Ample accommodation were made for feeding and caring for the whole com- pany of not less then four hundred souls.  Quite a number of these where outsiders, who had come to listen to the truth.  It is no small affair to provide and care for a gathering of this kind, as all that come have to be fed during the time of their stay, by those who live at the place of gathering.  It is done by free will gifts, some making large presents of food; a non-member of the Church, brought a large van, drawn by four large horses some fifteen miles, containing a ton of flour, eight 40 lbs bags of sugar, a sack of rice, a box of tea, four sacks of shell fish, and a quantity of sweet and Irish potatoes.  I mention this to show the liberality of the natives, in this respects, and the ENDENTRY instructions. We would be most thankful to receive any  information from Brother Geo Q. Cannon, or others, in re- lation to the number best to print? the best method to ad- opt to obtain the required means? andc. We mention brother  Cannon, because he has had an experiance with a sim- ular people and work, the printing and finding  will take about one year.  At our Conference in April, the following named  Elders will be honorably released to return home to the  bosom of the church and friends, having performed  good, long faithful missions, Viz.  Ezra F. Richards who has been here 3 1/2 years, the  last year he has labored on the translation of the Book  of Mormon, Francis H. Wright, Alfred W. Harper,  Elias Johnson and John L. Blyth, who will have  been here at the time of our conference three years, they  have all presided over Conferences, and have done  a good work, and will return home with honors, my  blessings and the blessings of the Elders and saints.  Please send the amoung for their return fares, ex- cept Elder Blyths, as his fare has already been sent,  at your earliest convenience, on the Union Bank of  Australia at Napier, as that will be the nearest  to our conference, and the place from which the  Elders will leave.  We will also be pleased to have five or six Elders  sent to this Island at your convenience, Young men ENDENTRY manner in which the large gathering was fed.  For the accommodation of the Elders, a large tent was erected and a temporary table, sufficiently large to seat thirty persons, with plates, dishes andc., to make it very pleasant, and the food furnished us was extra good. The Elders greatly rejoiced at having the opportunity of thus meeting together, it being thirteen months since our last general con- ference of the mission.  We also had the pleasure of Elder John L. Blyth's company, who has been laboring in Australia for the past three years, comparatively alone, in the midst of much opposition, and has by the blessings of God succeded in opening up the work in that part of the vineyard, organizing two branches andc. He is now on his return home to Zion, and will accompany Elders, F. H. Wright, Alma Hayes, all of which, except the last names, have performed good and faithful missions, laboring untiringly for the advancement of the cause of God, among this strange people; and they now return with an honor- -able release, my blessings, and blessings of the Elders and saints, and above these, the blessings of the Lord.  Elder Hayes returns through sickness; his constitu- tion seems to be broken down.  He tells me that he had two conjestive chills before he came here, ENDENTRY from 20 to 30 years of age are much preferable, as  they can acquire the language much more readly,  as also stand the climate and c the best, would like one  or two of them suitable for teaching school.  There are some few of our dusky friends that are  becoming quite anxious about gathering home to  Zion, About a year ago we wrote at some length  about the emigration of this peculiar people, giving  our opinion from what we had seen, about a suit- able place being selected for them, their mode of  living andc andc. If you have any instructions upon  this, and other matters we would be thankful to  receive them by our confereance.  We have recently returned from a three mounths  trip to the north part of the Island, and are very thank- ful to be able to state that the great majority of the  Saints, are endeavoring to live in accordance with the  principles of the Gospel, and they manifest quite a  love for the truth, as also for the servants of God, and  awe are able to see a marked improvement in their con-  dition, yet, there are those that become weary in the  service of the Lord, and return back to the beggarly  things of the world, adultry being the prevailing crime  among them, but, generally when they are caught in  the same, they will come forth and confess and seek  to be restored in fellowship, they are very peculiar  for this, so unlike the europeans. ENDENTRY and since his arrival in this land, he has had two severe attacks of sickness, suffering much with his lungs.  For the last two months we have had him staying with a kind family of europeans to be nursed up, but, in it all, he improves but little; he cannot ride horse back, nor walk but a short distance, so it became neccessary to release him to return home.  Elder Australia last nNovember has also got a constitution that has been shaken badly by sickness and exposure in his youth.  Since his arrival in his field of labor he has gradually failed in health, suffering much from his lungs, until he got so weak that he could not walk around; yet, he has a great desire to fill an honorable mission.  So he wrote to me, desiring to have the privilige of going to his native land, Scotland, to visit his relatives, and there fill a mission.  I have released him to go and report himself to President George Teasdale at A. L. Stewart to go and labor with S. D. Chipman, who has been appointed to succeed Elder Blyth.  Through the faithful and earnest labors of Elder's Sondra Sanders Jr., assisted by some native helep, the revision of the translation of the Book of Mormon was completed in time to present at our Conference; making it a little less then one year from the time of commencing the  ENDENTRY During our trip, four new branches and two new conferences were organized, there were also quite a  number added to the church by baptism, and since  George Romney Jr, writes that they have added 42 others to the Church  and organized another branch thus we are able to  report the work of the Lord spreading among the branch  of the house of Israel, to our great rejoicing.  The health of the Elders is good, and with but few  exceptions are making excelent progress in obtaining  a knowledge of the Maori language, and those that  have the language are laboring with a great perseverence  among those not of our faith during the summer mo- nths, and we trust their labors will be crowned  with abundant success.  Since last writing, we have received some copies  of the Epistle of the Apostles, which have been greatly  enjoyed by us, and we can say a hearty amen to  every sentiment and feel that such Epistles should  be a great blessing to all Saints. We wait with  great anxiety the arrival of each mail, feeling that im- portant changes can take place in a month, in these  peculiar and interesting times, we are also quite in- terested in Utah being admitted into Statehood, if that is the will of our Heavenly Father, truly these  are most peculiar times, yet, at the same time we are led to rejoice at seeing so visable the hand of God ENDENTRY translation.  To get it finished by this time, they had to work early and late.  Some portions of the translation was read at the conference, and pro- nounced by the best Maori linguist as being very good and plain, 400 pages of the book is copied or rewritten ready for the press.  The work now re- maining, is to finish writing the manuscript and read it over before a suitable Maori.  Elder S. Sanders Jr., have been appointed to this labor, assisted by sSister Katie.  He has also been appointed to preside over this, the Hawks Bay district.  In presenting it to the conference, and calling upon the saints for the means necessary for the printing and binding of the same, it was not received with that spirit of liberality that we could have desired.  This people have a great dread of being asked for means, as they have been so badly duped and swindled by the former churches; stating, "that the ministers pointed to heaven with one hand while they would steal their lands from under their feet with the other, yet, I have faith that the means will come from some quarters when needed.  Elder John L. Blyth, seeing the feelings and con- dition of the people, was inspired to give £50 fifty pounds to assist in this noble work.  This means his brother gave him in Australia, to pay his fare home.  I will enclose with this a Financial Statement ENDENTRY of means collected and expended, up to date of our conference since which £18.8.0 have been collected, besides the £50 from Elder Blyth.  The great majority of the people are very poor, and handle but little means. How the means will be collected I do not know, but, have faith that it will be forth coming in some way.  The feelings at conference, was to have 2000 copies printed and bound.  We much regretted that we detid not receive any letter from you in answer to our inquiries, feel- ing as I do, that there had been a letter sent that should have reached us, but owing to some unknown cause it did not arrive.  I cannot tell how great was my disappointment, and those of the Elders.  We shall take no action about the printing un- til we hear from you.   The remittance, for the return fares of the Elders, came safe, as also the amount sent in January for Elder Haight's return Ect.  Both drafts being in excess of the amounts sent for.  That of Jany. £9.0.0 and the last £8.0.0 making a total excess of £17.0.0 which amount I will use for the return fare of Elder Alma Hayes, with the additional sum of £13.0.0 which you will please send to me at your convenience on the Union Bank of Napier. N. Z.  This amount of £13.0.0 will balance our accounts up to date.  No doubt, but the fault is with me, ENDENTRY made bare in the defence of His covenant people,  and in the overthrow of the powers of the earth, sur^e^ly  Uncle Sam should turn his attention from Utah and  her people, to the fearful internal workings of his own  people, who are preparing to lay waste every City,  town and hamlit and bring destruction and death  to his people, the saints can well afford to wait  the Lords time in all things.  We are deeply interested in your welfare, and that  of the Apostles, knowing the powers that are brought  to bear against you, and of the great responsibilityies  resting upon you, earnest prayers continually ascend  unto Our Father and God, for His power, wisdom  and guidance to be with you, and all the leaders  of Israel.

Dear Beloved Brethren; Your kind and much appriciated letter of ^the^ 3rd of April came duly to hand, and was read with deep interest, and I now fear that I was not considerate enough of your many labors, expecting an answer to mine in so short a time, if so, it was from the great desire I had to hear from you before our conference, and often in our anxiety we do not carefully weigh the surroundings as we should before we Jump at conclusions. Therefore I beg to be excused, and hope to exercise more patience in the future. ENDENTRY in these amounts having being sent, through not making it fully plain to you.  With this I take pleasure in forwarding to you the Statistical report for the year ending Jany 31st 1888 by which you will see an addition of nine branches, and two new districts.  At our Conference, the Wairarapa district was devided into two, making twelve districts or Conferences in the mission; 343 have been added to the Church by baptism, and 163 children blessed, making an increase of 506.  Since January 31st there  has been over 100 more added to the Church, and the prospects for the future are very flattering in- deed, especially in the North.

We were thankful to learn of your  improved health, as also the good health of the Apostles.  It is also most gratifying to know that the Lord  has so wonderfully preserved the leaders of Israel from  imprisonment, while such strenuous effort are being  made to capture them, surely we are led to praise  God all the day long.  It truly is a "day of shaking" and one that is  increasing the faith of the saints in the living God,  and preparing us for the day of seperation, draw- ing the deviding line. What a consolation to know  that Our Heavnly Father, Brigham  and John with all the holy Prophets and Apostles that  have lived upon the earth, is on our side, and will  advocate our cause, and bring about our deliverance  in the appointed time of the Lord.  We watch with great interest the movements  of the Receiver and of our enemies, through the  medium of the Deseret News, and feel that Zion  has much to be thankful for.  You will please find inclosed the statement  asked for. I find that to get the returns in time  for the returning Elders, it will be necessary to  answer this by the return of mail, which leaves ENDENTRY We were delighted to hear of the good health prevailing in your midst, and sincerily desire and pray, that the same may continue.  Your kind discription of Bro Geo Q Cannons labors upon the translation of the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language was verry interesting indeed.  And we will here state that we had access to two good Native schoars, to ask for information and explanations during the time of translation, as also during the revision, and since receiving your much appreciated letter, we have secured (3) three excelent Natives to assist in the reading over carefully of the manuscript. All three are good in the Maori, and two excellant in the english ENDENTRY languge; And coming as they do from different parts of the Island, we feel that it will come forth the best that it can; for we will indeavor to carry out your instructions to our ut- most. These Brethren are Piripi Te Maari, and Hakopa Ratama. The two first are men of  more of means and influence, and they have given me to understand that they would come to my assistance with their means, so that the printing might be done as soon as possible.

I wish to say in his justifycation that he has been exceedingly diligent in ENDENTRY obtaining the language, and have done as well in the same length of time as anyone that has come to the island, and I much dislike to be under the necessity of sending him home, as we are so verry short of Maori linguest, in the mission.

The Elders are laboring with great diligen ce, But during the winter they cannot do as much, as in some parts, the roads are almost im- passable; In a letter received yesterday from Elder George Romney Jr, he stated that the horses were scarcely able to get through the mud with their bl- ankets etc, they having to walk, much of the roads are only bridle  paths, upon clay ground, through timber and brush. There is general good health prevailing ENDENTRY in the midst of the saints, as also an increased desire to live the princyples of truth. Yet we have continualy some cases of sin to cause us to grieve, for this people are so prone to go astray, much like the children of Israel. I now know how to sympathise with that great Prophet, "Moses," in his tryials. I donot blame him for getting righteously mad and breaking the tablets, ##Exodus 32:19## although I am thankfull to state that I have not had to get verry mad, but it do require great wisdom and patience; which I have not only as the Lord give it me. Since I last wrote you, in company with Elders John W. Kauleina- moku, and N. S.

And we are now in the Mananwatu district where we will hold Conference next Saturday and sunday. We have Just been introducing Elder Kauleina- moku into this new district, feeling that by the blessings of the Lord he will open up a good work around the west coast; as there are many Maories living upon the same. He has been apointed to preside over this district of country.

Also a check for (£15) fifteen pounds,  the balance of the return fair of El- der Meacham; In reading your much  appricated letter, we could not help  but feel in part the great anxiety and  burden that rests upon you, in these  most trying times; and the feelings  of our hearts go out unto our Kind  ENDENTRY loving Father in Heaven, for His power  and blessings to be ever with you; It  was very gratifying to us, to learn th- at there was a fair prospect of a uecuring  the Holy temples, meeting houses and other  Sacred places, from the hands ^of the^ wicked.  God to grant that it may be so overruled.  We will be much pleased to learn of the  success of Elder Jos. H.

I will have to borrow  the means for her return fare, which  you will please send to me on the Un- ion Bank of Auckland  at your earliest conveniance. For some  some cause I have not yet received only  a part of my mail that came by the  last Steamer, so do not know whether  there was a letter from you or not, but  think prehaps there is, as the draft came  and I feel much disapointed that it  has not come to hand. I am thankful  I am than to be able to state that my  ENDENTRY health is good, and that I am feeling splendid  splendid in my labors. Sometimes I get quite  tired and sore, but what of that, it is in a good  cause. It is with much pleasure that we  inform you, of the delivery of the Mss of  the Book of Mormon, in Maori into the  printers hands in Auckland, on the  4th of Sept, to have two thousand cop- ies printed, and bound in leather, that  being as many as we could execrcise faith  in having printed at this time; for at a  conference held just before we sent the M- SS to Auckland, there was a strong feeling  manifested by the Native breathren, not  to have it printed now feeling that they  could not raise the means required for the  payment of the same, but, by the power  of blessings of God, and laying before  them, that it was Gods Holy book, that  had been held in reserve to come  forth in the fulness of times, to give  them an understanding of their fore Fathers, and the pure Gospel of Christ.

President Wilford Woodruff, and Quorum of Apostles:  Dear and beloved Bretheren;  We cannot find words to fully express to you the great joy we have in the Lord at being spared in health and strength to once more address you by letter, from this, a small island of the sea, at the nethermost part of the earth. Yet in so doing we feel to offer up a silent, though fervent prayer to our loving Father in Heaven, that this may reach you in safety, and find you in the full enjoyment of health and every blessing of the Lord suited to your high and holy callings, and the great labors devolving upon you at this peculiar period in the history of the Church.  How we were made to rejoice and praise the Lord our God for the good news that came to us by the last mail, viz., the freedom of Pres Woodruff and Cannon, af- ter so long a confinement, to again mingle with and instruct the Saints of Israel in the great things of God; feeling as we do that it has not come any too soon for the good and welfare of Zion; for when the shepherds are absent, the flock is apt to become more or less affected.

While you were, with the many Saints rejoice- ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were rejoicing in our annual ^conference^, which has just closed at this place, and at which were in attendance thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at- tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts, except that of Tauranga. Great were the rejoicings of all present, as the spirit of God was so abundantly ^bestowed^ upon both speakers and hearers, and many were the words of inspiration that were spoken during the five days that we were together, two of which were occupied by the Elders in council, in which we were one and all melted to tears of joy as great was the spirit of God that was in our midst causing each one to arise to his feet and praise the living God; for we ^were^ enabled by the power of his Holy Spirit to testify that He is our Father and that we are His delegated sons, the embassadors of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every selfish feeling that might have been in our hearts was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon this island to labor among this benighted and sinful people, a portion of the House of Islrael. They have such faith in a Supreme being, as also in the Bible, that many of them are led to receive the truths of  ENDENTRY breaking down some of the strong bariors  that we now have to contend with, in the  Shape of Maori prophets, who are leading  many into sin, and disbelief in the bible,  there fore our great anxiety to have  it printed at once. Our Statistical report  for the six months ending July 31st  show an increas of eighty baptisms  and twenty children blessd, over that  of the same period of last year, for wh- ich we are led to praise God, and we  have still bright prospects for the  future, as we generally do much better  during the Summer then the winter  months. The health of the Elders is now  good as far as George  Romney Jr and David Muir have both been  quite unwell with bad colds, but are  feeling well again, for which I feel  very thankful. Since my last letter to  you I have visited six districts, attendid  conferences in the same, and it is most  gratifying to me to be able to state  ENDENTRY the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they are precisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles. And many, very many others would receive the same if it were not for the power exercised by the chiefs ofver the various tribes. This power however will sooner or later be broken down as that every hon- est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change in the respect in ^during^ the past three years, for wherever the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent with their feelings of cheifship, or desires to keep others in subjection. This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of leading cheifs in attendance, yet they were humble as children and one with the Saints in all things. And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvment the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal apperanance and deportment, and willingness to hearken unto counsel.  One of the leading features of the conference and one that gave great joy unto the Saints, was hav- ing five hundred copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori, to distribute amongst them. Never were chil- dren more anxious to receive their Christmas pres- ents, than were this people to receive that holy book. And although nearly all present had paid from five ENDENTRY that I find a good spirit prevailing am- ong the Saints, and fully as much  improved, as we could naturally expect,  after so long a training in sin and  every visious habit. I feel that they are  doing wonderfully well, as we are able to  to see the advancements made by them  through traveling and mingling with  those not in the Church, as I have  to do in traveling from one district to  another. I am pleased to State, that wh- ere-ever we go we have the priveledge  of holding meetings and beering testim- ones to the truth of the Gospel, and  warning the people of the great  day of God, for it is seldom that I  do not hold from eight to ten meetings  a weak and often more then that. We  are organiazing Sunday schools in  many of the branches, and we find  they have a verry benefical offect, for  great interest is taken in them, by yo- ung and old, and when we receive the-  ENDENTRY Kiri Kiri, N. Z. July 11th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff,  And Counselors.  Much beloved Brethren,  We are just in receipt of your  long and most interesting epis- tle of the 23rd of May, And now  hasten to pen a few lines in  reply. Seeing that it arrived  too late for us to return by the  present mail Steamer, that  you may know that it was  received, as also of our moove- ments. But it will necessarly  have to be brief for the lack  of time, as we are now trav- ling through the district, holding  conferences.  We had learned by the pre- vious mail, of the Organ- azation of the First Presidency ENDENTRY shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards, and were entitled to receive copies without any fur- ther payments, yet so great was their joy, that about eighty paid for their books five shillings each saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the final payment that there might be a fund on hand for the publishing of other works, as they desire to recieve all that God has revealed for the guidance and blessing of His children. When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was that means nescessary to carry on this work should be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this has been the case from the commencement until this time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become due just enough to pay them has been forthcoming, and for the last payment the Saints have exceeded our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this a statement will his furnished showing the receipt and disbursements and balance on hand which I feel will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of £80.12.5 we have collected £18.3.6 for the sale of books making a total of £98.15.11 so that all that is lacking is about fifty pounds. ENDENTRY printed matter matter in Maori that the  Deseret Sunday School Union have so  kindly consented and agread to furnish  us, we look for a still greater interest  to be taken and much more good  to be accomplished; Our day schools  are doing well, the Saints testify that  the children are learning much faster  then they do in the Government sch- ools.  It now become my painful  duty, to refer to that which  is not so pleasant, and I am  sure it will cause you feelings  of sorrow, as it had done my- self and Elder Wright.  I will inclose a letter wrote  by redacted text redacted text to President  Woodruff, which will in  part, explain it self, this was  wrote with the intention of  sending it direct, and wait  ENDENTRY during the April Conference,  And felt greatly to rejoice in  the same. And will say, that  the brethren thus sustained  met with our hearty appr- oval and support, knowing  as we do know, that they  are the right men, in the  right place.  Your kind and inspiring  letter afforded us much ple- asure in reading the same, to  learn of your good health as also of your travels and labors  among the saints. As we  realiaze that they will result  in great good. It was most  gratifying to learn that Nephi  received a vissit from you, and  were premitted once more to  listen to your inspiring words  of council, and trust the  saints will receive them, ENDENTRY You will also be most gratified to note the in- crease of souls during the past year. From statisti- cal report inclosed you will see that 573 have been baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743 which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre- vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or- ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools, which with the large sum of money raised for the printing of the Book of Mormon, and that important work having been nearly completed, we are filled with thanksgiving and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful- ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty. But by His aid and blessings we have sought to mgag- nify our most high and holy callings as embassa- dor of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real- ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain- ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state that the prospects for the future are very encouraging indeed, and by the aid that we feel that the Book of Mormon will begin aiding in the spreading of the Word of God, we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls.

Upon inquiry, I learned that  he had first committed him- self with a married woman  about six years ago, who had  received her endowments.  After that, he repented for three  years, but, on reading, that  an adulturer could enter into  the Celestial Kingdom of God,  he became reckless, and let  his passions run wild with  him, up to within three ENDENTRY that they may be benefited  and blest thereby.

We feel thankful for all your  councils, as also for all the  items of news.  Now dear brethren, in relation  to the appointing of me suc- cessor, I beg to state that I will  not take any action in the same  untill after the arrival of the  next mail, thinking that there  ^may^ be further instructions from  you, in answer to my letter  sent to you upon that subject.

Feeling that I had no right to handle his case here, and that we could not keep the natives from having sus- picions, seeing that he could not act in his calling, I have released him to return home by the  same Steamer that has this to you. And have counciled him to see one of the Apostles, and lay  before him his sad and painful affair.  I trust in this I have done right, as, I would much dislike the natives to learn the  nature of this case, has they now have every confidance in the servants of God, ENDENTRY but if no further word are  sent to us, we will appoint  and set apart the one you men- tioned in your letter.

City the  beginning of Sept, at which time  we hope to be favored  with the great prevelidge of  again beholding and greeting  our beloved President and his cou- nsolers, which thought insp- ires the soul as we now write,  for it seem an age since  we had that priveledge.

The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most excellent spirit and are returning to their various districts feeling that this has been by far the best con- ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint- ments and ^our^ council meetings there was not a mur- mur or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them- selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were in attendance at our conference, and have now been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap- pearance much, and think they are well adapted for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo. T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of poor health. While speaking of the Elders still say that we feel blessed in having such a good faith- ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and claim them to be.  Much might be said of our conference, the large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind- ness of those not in the church, etc. but as a full re- port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not take your valuable time by relating those items here: will simply say that the weather and all per- taining to the same was delightful.

Alexander  Bullock who has been here two years, a good faith- ful man over fifty years of age. He has not been able to acquire the language, but has done all the good that laid in his power. And H.

I will borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly responded to our last letter regarding the payment for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.  We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return home with Elder A. L.

If the  Church could remit that  amount to me, and let  him pay them, I could then meet my obligations, and thus keep my credit good, as I frequently have to bor- row for these purposes.  We are now having  beautiful weather, and all nature is putting on her best attire; we have had a much more favorable winter, then the one previous.  We were rejoiced to learn of your good health, and sincerely desire and pray that the same may continue ENDENTRY Elders N. S. Bishop and J. W.

The understanding was that brother, whom he went to see, would pay his return fare but not having heard from him I do not know how it will be.

We tell them to be patient, that this matter is before you, and in the due  time of the Lord the word will come for them to gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and then like children they will spring the same question again.  The hireling priest of the day, both European and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about us, the Elders, being in their midst; and at a conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at which there were three archbishops present, they got up a petition with many signatures, and sent to parliament asking for a law compell- ing us to return, ^or leave the island,^ and hindering any others from coming: setting forth that we are destroying the peace of the people; that before we came they were united in religious matters, but now we are causing them to leave the church of their ENDENTRY Direct letter in c/o James Hay, Cobden Street,  Newton, Auckland,  New Zealand.

I fully realiaze that I have  not done any more then my  duty, and prehaps not as  well as many others would  of done.

It will be quite necessary to  have (6) six more Elders  sent to their field as soon  as possible, and if two of  the number, that has some  tact as school teachers, could  be sent, to take the place of  those now teaching school, it  would be splended, as they  are needed to travel, as soon  as they acquire the language,  ENDENTRY fathers, that taught them to live in peace, quit eating each other andc. andc. Surely they feel that priestcraft is in danger. They are trying to stir up the people against us, but, thank God, all their desires fail and will continue to do so.  The tracts you so kindly sent, arrived safely and have been distributed to the various di- tricts, and we feel thankful that we can dis- tribute the printed word among the Europeans. But our experience among them forces this con- clusion upon our minds; viz. that there are but very few really honest in heart amongst them. Those that have been baptized into the church do not turn out well as a general rule. There is far more pleasure in laboring among the Maories with all their weaknesses and pecul- iarities.  During the conference it was thought best to hold two conferences each year one in the South of the island because of the great distance to be traveled. Keeping ma^n^y away from being present, and notwith- standing the great expense of feeding such a gathering, they are all anxious to have it in their own districts.

Yet in so doing we feel to offer up a silent, though fervent prayer to our loving Father in Heaven, that this may reach you in safety, and find you in the full enjoyment of health and every blessing of the Lord suited to your high and holy callings, and the great labors devolving upon you at this peculiar period in the history of the Church.  How we were made to rejoice and praise the Lord our God for the good news that came to us by the last mail, viz, the freedom of Pres Woodruff and Cannon, af- ter so long a confinement, to again mingle with and  instruct the Saints of Israel in the great things of God; feeling as we do that it has not come any too soon for the good and welfare of Zion; for when the shepherds  are absent, the flock is apt to become more or less affected.

Realizing at the same ENDENTRY rejoice both at home and abroad.  While you were, with the many Saints rejoic- ing in conference in Salt Lake City, we also were  rejoicing in our annual ^conference^ which has just closed at  this place, and at which were in attendance  thirty one of the Elders from Zion, as also a large at- tendance of our dusky friends from all the districts,  except that of Tauranga.

Every  slelfish feeling that might have been in our hearts  was swallowed up in the love of God, and we were  led to rejoice much that our lot has been cast upon  this island to labor among this benighted and sinful  people, a portion of the House of Israel. They have  such faith in a Supreme being, as also in the bBible,  that many of them are led to receive the truths of ENDENTRY time how very weak we are, and the necessity of leaning upon the Lord for strength, wisdom and qualification necessary for us.  Your esteemed favors of Aug- ust 20th and Sept 17th came duly to hand and were read with the  usual deep pleasure and interest We were caused to rejoice to learn of the good health pre- vailing in your midst and the desires of our hearts are that you may continue on the enjoyment of the same blessings.  It was indeed a great surprise to us to learn of Our Beloved Brother George Q. Cannon giving himself up to the Gov- ernment officials and still more ENDENTRY the Gospel soon as they hear them, for they see that they are  precisely the same as taught by Christ and His apostles.  And many, very many others would receive the  same if it were not for the power exercised by the  chiefs ofver the various tribes. This power however  will sooner or later be broken down so that every hon- est soul may rejoice in the truth. We see a great change  in this respect in ^during^ the past three years, for wherever  the Gospel is received, it does away to a great extent  with their feelings of chiefship, or desires to keep  others in subjection. This was quite marked dur- ing our conference, as we had quite a number of  leading chiefs in attendance, yet they were humble  as children, and one with the Saints in all things.  And we were also made to rejoice in beholding the  great improvement the Saints are making in know- ledge and faith in the Gospel, as also their personal  appearance and deportment, and willingness to  hearken unto counsel.

We sincerely hope that they will not be able to trump up any other charge against him, so as to retain him in their power. For we feel with you that he with the leaders  of Israel, are needed much to labor in the midst of the people and give unto the Saints the word of the Lord, guiding and directing them in the  path they ought to walk How gladly the Saints will re- ceive their words of council and instruction after having been for such a long time excluded from their midst. We feel that ENDENTRY shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards,  and were entitled to receive copies without any fur- ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that  about eighty paid for their books five shillings each  saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their  desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the  final payment that there might be a fund on hand  for the publishing of other works, as they desire to  receive all that God has revealed for the guidance  and blessing of His children. When I was set  apart for this mission, among other great promises  and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was  that means necessary to carry on this work should  be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this  has been the case from the commencement until this  time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys- terious manner, and as the payments have become  due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming,  and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded  our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this  a statement will be furnished showing the receipt and disbursements in balance on hand which I feel  will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of  £80-12-5, we have collected £18-3-6 for the sale of books  making a total of £98-15-11 so that all that is lacking  is about fifty pounds.

By some means the Elders did not bring the tracts you stated would be sent to us. We sincerely hope they will come by the Elders now on their way here. It was very gratify- ing to receive instructions concern- ing the emigration of the "Maories" For we have written three times on the same subject without ENDENTRY since the date of the report.  The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most  excellent spirit and are returning to their various  districts feeling that this has been by far the best con- ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint- ments and ^our^ council meetings, there was not a mur- mur, or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them- selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed  in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in  March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were  in attendance at our conference, and have now  been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap- pearance much, and think they are well adapted  for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo. T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of  poor health. While speaking of the Elders Iwill say  that we feel blessed in having such a good faith- ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and  claim them to be.  Much might be said of our conference, the  large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind- ness of those not in the church, etc. but, as a full re- port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not  take your valuable time by relating those items  here: will simply say that the weather and all per- taining to the same was delightful. There was ENDENTRY nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of  those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment  of the same Spirit that was with you in your con- ference.  You will please send a remittance of nine- ty pounds (£90)on the Union Bank of Australia  at A. L.  Stewart now laboring in Australia, who has not  enjoyed the best of health during the two years he  has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep  him here over another of the wet winters of Australia  as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander  Bullock, who has been here two years, a good faith- ful man, over fifty years of age. He has not been  able to acquire the language, but has done all the  good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who  has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The  two first named will most likely return in May, with  a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will  borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly  responded to our last letter regarding the payment  for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.   We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return  home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Australia. feeling that  it would not be best for him to remain here over  winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy  ENDENTRY receiving any word until now. We did not know what answer to give to those so anxious to gather. But now, we feel that they will be quite reconciled for a time, to wait until that suitable place is selected for them. We will pre- sent it to them in the best light possible. We are sorry to have to report another case of hostility. This time it was with the native Saints and not the Elders. Yet it occured at the same place that Elders Johnson and Magleby were tied up and kept prisoners for two days. The chief and some of the leading men at this village are very bitter enemies to the Church. And recently some of his people ENDENTRY years old. The understanding was that his brother,  whom he went to see, would pay his return fare;  but, not having heard from him I do not know  how it will be.  There continues to be quite an enquiry among  our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion,  feeling that they desire to get to the land of their  forefathers where the Prophet and Apostles and the  holy temples are, andc. We tell them to be patient,  that this matter is before you, and in the due  time of the Lord, the word will come for them to  gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and  then like children they will spring the same question  again.  The hireling priest of the day, both European  and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about  us, the Elders, being in their midst: and at a  conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at  which there were three archbishops present, they  got up a petition with many signatures, and  sent to parliament asking for a law compell- ing us to return, ^or leave the islands,^ and hindering any others from  coming: setting forth that we are destroying the  peace of the people; that before we came they  were united in religious matters, but now  we are causing them to leave the church of their  ENDENTRY became convinced of the truth of the Gospel and embranced the same. This was done during a visit to other parts. So when they returned to their homes some of the people, led on by the chief and a hirelying priest, commenced  to affect them to endeavour to  get them to leave the church Among other things they tied brother and his wife up for two days and nights. Also badly whipped, knocked down and kicked another brother and but for being afraid of the laws of the lands no doubt would have killed them. The guilty parties were summoned before Judge Booth but did not receive their just  dues, as he, the Judge, is a ENDENTRY fathers, that taught them to live in peace, quit  eating each other andc. andc. Surely they feel that  priestcraft is in danger. They are trying to  stir pup the people against us, but, thank God, all  their desires fail, and will continue to do so.  The tracts you so friendly sent, arrived safely  and have been distributed to the various dis tricts, and we feel thankful that we can dis- tribute the printed word among the Europeans,  but our experience among them forces, this con- clusion upon our minds; viz that there are  but very few really honest and heart amongst  them. Those that have been baptized into the church  do not turn out well as a general rule. There  is far more pleasure in laboring among the  Maories with all their weaknesses and pecul- iarities.  During the conference it was thought best  to hold two conferences each year, one in the  North and one in the South of the island because  of the great distance to be traveled. Keeping  ma^n^y away from being present, and notwith- standing the great expense of feeding such  a gathering, they are all anxious to have it in  their own districts.  We will take pleasure in sending a copy ENDENTRY member of the Church of England and a friend to the minister. But on word being sent to Well- ington, the Government seat, con- cerning their proceedings we were instructed to take the next case to the higher court, with a promise that we should receive justice as they approved of our labours among the natives. For we are teaching them to keep the laws of the land etc. We, therefore, do not look for another occurrence of that kind, at least at the same place.  It is with hearts filled with thanksgivings and praises unto our Heavenly Father, that we report to you the condition of this important mission. For we realize ENDENTRY of the Book of Mormon by the first returning  Elders.  Having now sufficient Elders we have direct- ed two from this conference, Elders N. S. Bishop and South Island, to endeav- or to open up the work amoung the Maories of that is- land. A native brother who has lived there has also been appointed to accompany them.  All the Elders at the conference unite in send- ing profound love and blessings, and ever praying for the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy, that you may ever be fully adequate for every circumstance which may arise, we remain Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ.  Wm Paxman ENDENTRY that it is through the blessings of God, and the ernest efforts of my co-labourers, that we are enabled to make such a favorable and good report. In this the Bay of Islands District, in which I am now laboring and will be, the Lord willing, for some time yet, there has been one hundred and twenty five added to the Church during the past six weeks, and the prospects are most encourag- ing for many more to come  forth and enter into the Church of Christ through the door of baptism, in the near future.  Very favorable reports reach me from all the Districts and more or less are being added to the Church. In Australia the Elders ENDENTRY meet with a great amount of opposition to encounter. And there seem to be very few that care an iota about religion. They are more lovers of pleasures than lovers of God, their lives being the riches of the world. Still the Elders labors with great diligence and are doing all that lies in their power to warn the people. Sister Armstrong and family of five children, emigrated by the last mail steamer from that place. This makes it still worse for the Elders, as that was their best and almost only home. We have had five thous- and tracts printed entitled, "Good tidings or the New and Everlasting Gospel" by Jos. F. Smith for ENDENTRY that part and the Europeans upon these Islands. So with the tracts you are sending us we will be better prepared to warn the people and find the few honest in heart  The health of the Elders is good, as far as I now know. And there is general goods health prevailing among the Saints. As was expected Elders H. J. Man ning and child and Sister Katie left for home by the last mail steamer, as also  a young sister, Charlotte Rowntree, and the six mentioned from  Sydney. Elder Manning was ap- pointed to take charge of the company. They return with Hon -orable Releases having performed faithful missions ENDENTRY Te Hauke, Hawks Bay New Zealand, July 3, 1888  President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum of Apostles;  Dear and beloved Brethren: Once more through the loving kindness of our Heaven- ly Father we are permitted to address you by letter, in answer to your most welcome and highly appreciated fa- vor of the 24th of May, which reached us on the 30th of June, since which time it has been read and re-read  with increased interest and joy, for we need not state that our hearts were made to swell within us with rejoic- ings, and praises unto the Lord our God to know that another Temple had been dedicated unto the Most high God, and made holy by His presence and acceptance,  and by the rich out pouring of His Holy Spirit to fill every part thereof—even to the rejoicing of all that were permitted to enter its sacred portals, many of whom,  I feel assured, heard and saw the marked manifestations of Gods approval and acceptance of so beautiful an offering from His covenant children. Your discription of its elegance and beauty of finish, making it so grand and pleasing to the eye, was very gratifying indeed.  We could not helpp feeling in our hearts, Oh, that we might have been present to have partaken of those blessed privilages, yet, feeling at the same time, that ENDENTRY As we may not be able to write to you for some time, and in order to give you time, will here state, that we would like to have four or five Elders for this Mission arrive in Auckland in March next. The steamer will leave San Francisco about the 8th of March.  Elders J. W. Kau- leinamoku, have now been here about three years and four months Therefore it will be right for them to return home in early Spring. They have filled most ex- cellent missions. So please send the means for their return fares on the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland.  We were much gratified to ENDENTRY we are just where Father wants us to be; therefore we are reconciled to labor with our might to bless this branch of the house of Israel. And we unite with you in the prayer that the Mighty One will ever preserve it from the hands of the wicked and the defilement of the unclean,  that it may continue a house holy unto the Lord, in  which the Saints may receive their blessings, and labor for the redemption of their dead.  Surely this will be an aditional strength to the Saints,  in which we will have greater power with the heavens; God grant that it may be so.  How rejoiced we were to learn of your brief stay in Juab Stake, and that we had a son that was worthy of your confidence and had the privilage of an inter- view with you; we had expressed a wish that you might have the privilage of dedicating the Temple before it was open to the public.  The account given of the actions of the Receiver is not so pleasing; they produce feelings of another kind for we see in his actions the strong determination of Satan to destroy the church of Christ, and afflict in every possible way the saints of the Most High, and feel if he can stop the glorious labor that is now being done in the Holy Temples, he will have gained a great  victory.  Earnest prayers are being offered up in this the nethermost part of the earth, for the Lord to preserve those holy buildings from falling into the hands of our enemies yet, at the same time we fully realize that all is in ENDENTRY the hands of the Lord, and that he will control all things for the best, for, as you sayo beautifully say, come what  will, it will not destroy the fact of revelation or the Gospel being restored, and if we are faithful to them no power can seperate us from the love of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ.  By the same mail that brought your letter we learn with deep regret of the death of our beloved brother Apostle Erastes Snow. Another noble spirit has gone to join with our illustrious prophets, apostles, patriarchs, and saints that have gone before, to intercede with the heavenly hosts in the behalf of the saints left behind.  The seven Elders mentioned by you, arrived at Auckland in safety on the 23 of June, feeling well in spirits, and have been assigned to their fields of labor as follows:  Poverty Bay;  Waikoto;  Waiapi; and Hauraka districts, the last three to teach school, and in a short time Elder Reid will also teach school in the Bay of Islands.  In relation to our day-schools, we will here state that we are careful not to organize them, only in such parts where there are no Government schools within reach of the child- dren, and where there are a number of children growing up in ignorance, for we see it will be a labor to keep them up; however, it affords the Elders this teaching, an opportunity of acquiring the language, and fitting them for the ENDENTRY learn of the success of the work of the Lord upon the Samoan Islands and trust that the interest may continue.  Also very thankful to know that the new judges are acting with more justice and consideration to- wards the Saints. And do sin- cerely trust that the same spirit may continue to be mani- fested. We learn from the papers that the Supreme Court of the Territory has decided against us in the property suit. That is as good as we could naturally expect from that body. But we sincerely hope that that ^the^ Supreme Court of the  U States may have eyes to see and ears to hear, that justice may be done. We are well in health ENDENTRY missionary field, for as a general thing an education aids much in acquiring the language: where ever the schools have been started we find the children very quick toin learning.  We are also organizing Sunday Schools in all the branches where we have sufficient children, and can find suitable material for the officers; quite an interest is manifested in the same, by old and young, and we feel they will be the means of doing much good.  In the coming fall it will be time for the follow- ing named Elders to be released to return home, viz. Sandra Sanders Jr, it being now three years since he left home, M. S. Marriott and Sister Georgena Marriott, as it will make three years for them by that time, they have all filled most ex- cellant missions, doing all that layed in their power to aid in the saving of souls, and the warning of the people of the great and terrible day of the Lord. Elder Sanders has labored faithfully for upwards of a year upon the translation of the Book of Mormon. Please send the draft for their return fares, on the Union Bank of Auckland ^Australia^, at Auckland  Elders J. W. Kauleinamoko came here at the same time as Elder Sanders, but as we meed them to assist in the opening up of new districts, being short of Maori linguists, they are willing to remain until spring.  We would be most pleased to have (6) six ENDENTRY and feeling splendid in our labors and desire to do all that lies in our power to further the pur- poses of God on this part of God's vineyard. The printing of the Book of Mormon is progressing nicely. We desire to have it completed by our April Conference. Though the means is coming in rather slowly at present.  Ever praying for the choicest blessings of God our Eternal Father to be yours. That you may be adaquate to every emergency With profound and sincere love in Which Elders Geo Romney Jr. and E. Mangleby, who I am now with, join. I am now as ever  Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ. Wm Paxman ENDENTRY Elders for this mission, if it could be arranged for them to leave San Francisco by the steamer that sails from there on the 17 of October. I could meet them  on their arrival at Auckland, as, the Lord willing,  I will be there at that time on my way to the Bay of Islands, the extreme north end of the Island: if two or three of that number had an aptitude to teach school we would be thankful.  We are now extending our labors more among the Eu- ropeans, than we have done before, and by the blessings of the Lord there has been quite a few baptized, but we labor under a disadvantage in not having a suply of tracts for them, and, having the publishing of Book of Mormon on hand, we dare not ask for means out side of that. The Tithing that comes in is but very small, hardly suffic- ient to meet the small current expenses. If some of our brethren that have made fortunes in a day, by selling their inheritences, could be induced to send out a few thous- and tracts, treating on the first principles of the Gospel etc., we could make excellant use of them, and they would thereby be preaching the Gospel by the printed word; the tracts could be sent by the coming Elders without any expense.

May 8th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear and much beloved Brother.  We are just in receipt of your most esteemed favor of the 1st of April, which was read and reread with deep interes,.  And we feel greatly blest to receive so much of your attention and kind consideration, and was indeed blest in our feelings to learn of the good health of yourself and those of the Apostles. As also to learn of the prosperety and welfare of Zion in all of her department. It was most gratifying to learn of the grand success of the Church Schools now organized, as also of the bright prospects of others being started in the near future.  We feel assured that you had a glorious time during your conference, and we sincerely hope that among the "important items of buisness transadid" that the First Presidency was organized, as we feel that the Church is much stronger with all her quorums fully organized, and how blest we as saints are, for your life having been preserved upon the earth to direct the affairs of God upon His foot stool, having been so familiar with the Church of Christ from ENDENTRY the beginning, Surely the Lord has had a purpose in thus preserving you with all your mental and physicial faculties to such a ripe age.  And may God's choice blessings ever be with you and those associated with you, is the many earnest prayers that are offered up by our dusky friends, as also the Elders.  We with you sincerely desire that our en- emies will not prevail with Prest Harrison in getting our most bitter enemies appoin- ted to fill the various offices of the Territory.  We are indeed verry grateful for your kin- dness in loaning the $500, asked for, that we might be able to meet our obligations incured in the printing of the 2,000 copies of the Book of Mormon in Maori: and feel exceedingly thankful for the same.  And we are truly happy to be able to state that we are in a possition so that we will not need to use more then $200 of the amount sent, as we stated in our letter sent to you by the last mail. So if you have not sent the £90 - asked for, on the recept of this, please do not send only £30 and credit us with the $300, and the Lord willing it will be but a short time before we will be able to refund the remaining $200, as the Natives are ENDENTRY future look fully as favorable as at any time in the past; for, although the ministers of the various churches are doing all that lay in their power against the work of God among our dusky friends, calling their chiefs together to poisen their minds etc., they do not succeed as they would like, for they generally find some of our Elders or Saints to rebut their statements and stand up in our favor, giving the  natives a chance to see the differance between p Priesthood and Priestcraft, and in many cases doing more good than harm, for they overstep all bounds of reason, and tell such barefaced falshoods that even the natives can de- tect them.  On S. Sanders and Sister Katie in the enjoyment of health, and about fin- ishing the writing of the MSS, ready for the reading before our Maori brethren, as soon as they can get there.  Elder Marriott wrote me a few days ago asking if there would be any objections of one of our Native Sisters emigrating to Zion, the only objection I see in the way is, that others will desire to follow in the same way, for it will not do to extend to one any liberties that cannot be given to all as they are so peculiar in this respect, so much like children we have to be exceedingly careful in every movement we make with them, and with their limited experience in the Gospel, and their natural desire to im- itate after the evils. Fears are entertained by us that some of them might partake of the bad element of our once peaceful cities and report back the amount ENDENTRY anxious to get the books to read, and in a few days we will have another 500 copies ready for sale.  We have indeed been blest in this labor.  Now dear President, regarding  your enquiries. "Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommend to succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it will be necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Australasia be sent from here?"  We will here state, that we have two Elders that in my judgment would be suitable to fill this possition, namely Ogden, who has been here 1 1/2 years.  And Clifton, Ida- ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of that Ward, he has been here one year the 23rd of next month, they are both good men, and wou- ld do all that laid in their power to further the work of God in this land.  I fear how- ever that the first named would not be able to endure so much horse back riding as is required of the president of this mission, as he is enclined to be stout and riding to much on horse back seem to hurt him.  At our anual conference, last month, they were both appointed to preside over verry important districts, those that had ENDENTRY of wrong doing there is in the midst of the saints,  such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath- breaking etc., which would spread from one end of the Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.  It might be well to here state that our dusky friends are exceedingly fond of all sports and ammusements, such  as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., and it would not require but a small exertion on their part to follow after all such things. Our feelings are that when they emigrate, there should be a suitable location for them to gather to, that they might be together, as all their work now is done on the United order principle; they will not work, live, eat or sleep alone, and they are not ever fond of work, but if properly directed they can do a great deal of work. Having thus given our feelings in brief, we will be pleased to receive and carry out any suggestions or instructions you may deem best to give on this matter.  There is general good health prevailing in the midst of the saints, there has been no time since our arrival here that the saints have been so free from sickness.  The health of the Elders and Sisters is also good, for which we feel exceedingly thankful to our Heavenly Father.  We were rejoiced to learn of your good health and have a great desire that it may so continue, for we see to a limited extent the great labors that are upon you in these very trying times as also the intense anxiety. Earnest, yet humble prayers are con ENDENTRY been somewhat neglected for the want of suitable Elders to preside over them.  And if eith- er of them were called, we would not know just how to fill up the vacency and do justice to the district, yet, if you are led to appoint one of them we could get along some how, but, if a good wise fatherly Elder could be sent from home, it might be good, as it would give him a longer time to preside, and leave these districts mentioned in a better condition.  This mission is quite large and is still growing.  It now take about a year to go over the same, attending conferences, etc.   We have a great desire, and feel sure that the ^right^ one will be appointed, for this is a verry peculiar people to handle, and by the blessings of the Lord we now have their love and confidance.  Elder A. L. Stewart, will return home with a small company of European saints, by the steamer that bring this to you, he is a good faithful worker and have prefor- med a good mission of two years; the last one being in Australia.

The balance of  the company were appointed  to various fields on this  Island.  While on this subject I wish  to enquire what to do in the  case of Bro.

Please  notify five instead of four, to reach here at the time  stated.

As Elder Stevenson  had intended returning by  Europe, but having changed  his mind, he has a surplus  of money; and not caring to  carry so much across with  him, has deposited fifty (50) ENDENTRY sionaries at as early a date as  March, for the work continues to  grow, new fields are opening,  and additional Elders will be  needed. The five Elders which  I wrote for last mail, please  send as soon as convenient, in  addition to the two sailing in  March.  Your instructions concern- ing the general fast day were  received, but not till after the  day appointed had passed. We  however, realizing also the benefit  of prayer, set apart one of the  days of our conference when we  fasted and offered our feeble  supplications to the Throne of  Grace in behalf of Zion gener- ally, and her leaders in par- ticular. It was a day of rejoic- ENDENTRY I think it advisable to send some one well versed in the principles of the Gospel; of good judgment, and a man of experience in presiding or sitting in judgment on diff- icultys arising among memb- ers of the Church.

We mail a report of our  interesting conference to the News.  Truly we had a time of rejoicing  and we have not experienced a  richer flow of the spirit of testi- mony since we have had the  pleasure of laboring among this  peculiar people. Many of the  Elders have also been unusually  blessed in acquiring the language,  one in particular, who bore his  testimony quite intelligently in  the native tongue after a residence  of but four weeks among them.  The manifestations which we  are almost daily receiving are a  source of great consolation to us, ENDENTRY pounds with me. I have  credited your account with this  amount, which I will use  on return fares of those re- turning in Oct.

The two Elders who  were expected last month did  not arrive. I hope there will  be some on this boat as they are  much needed.

I submit these suggestions becaus I realize this is a large, important, and very expensive mission; beleiving that its future success depe- nds largely on the capabilities and influence of the presiding officer, and also through my great desire to see it continue to grow and prosper.

Dec 26th 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Council,  My Dearly Beloved Leaders:  I again take pleasure in addressing a few words to you, to report our condition and requirements in this remote part of the Lords Vineyard. I am pleased to state first that Elders. O. C. Dunford and wife arrived safely and in good health and spirits, by the last mail boat having had a pleasant and comparatively smooth passage. While on this subject, I will say that I think it would be best to discourage the Elders from bringing their wives with them to this field of labor, for really it is not a suitable place, nor have we proper accommodations for our sisters.  I was somewhat surprised at not getting notice from you of their coming, nor even a letter with them, and it was only by chance that I heard of their coming and averted what might have been quite an inconvenience to them, as it is almost absolutely necessary for some one to meet them here to assist them in making necessary pur- chases. etc  Will you be kind enough to send me about five more new Elders for this field, to fill the places of those which ENDENTRY ition to the purposes of God, and as his time is drawing nigh can we expect him to relax his efforts? We feel to say am- en to your testimonies regarding the final result of the work of God.  We thank the Lord that the saints are once more privileged to listen to your inspired concsels, and know they appreciate them as we shall do when once more al- lowed that great blessing. We feel to rejoice to know that we are remembered in your sup- plications to the throne of our Maker, and can assure you that fervent prayers are daily offered by the Elders and saints in this far off land, for your continued peace, health and general prosperity. ENDENTRY will be released in April. If they could come on the boat which leaves San Francisco about April 5th, it would be most convenient; if that is too short notice, please send by boat leaving second or third of May.  If you will kindly notify me a mail in advance I will appreciate it very much. I would like to have at least two of them qualified for school teaching, and if I may be permitted to suggest, I would say, that when selecting Elders for this field it would be well to remember that they have a new and difficult language to learn, and all books issued as helps to the learner, are on a grammatical basis, and therefore Elders who have no knowledge of grammar, find the study very irksome and the acquiring of the language almost impossible, consequently very discouraging to themselves and the native saints who are expected to provide for them.  The Lord has wonderfully blessed many of us, in our comparative ignorance of our own tongue, "But all have not the same gifts, though directed by the same spirit" ##Doctrine and Covenants 46:11## ##1 Corinthians 12:4##  With regard to the Australian part of our field of labor we have but two there whom we can depend upon as laboring Elders, the third one (Brother Bromley) is visiting relatives, and as one of them, Brother Chip- man, will be released in April, it will perhaps be necessary to send some elders there. That is if it is intended to continue the mission. I suppose though ENDENTRY Since my appointment to the  high and responsible position as President of this mission, a calling which I by no means feel capable of magnifying, I have been attending conferences and laboring among the outsiders in the extreme Northpart of the Island.  I am sorry to say that our  labors were not crowned with much success, owing princi- pally to the united and persist- ant efforts of the clergy. They are continually warning the people against us, and in so- me withplaces we could with difficulty get places to sleep, and having in many instances, the doors closed in our faces.  The Maories are naturally a hospitable people, but the lies ENDENTRY that President Paxman has reported its conditions, and suggested to you its requirements.  From a recent letter received from Elder Chipman, he represents the people as being very indifferent, and that after thoroughly advertising in daily papers, post- ing circulars etc., that but perhaps three or four strangers would come to their hall, and it reminded us forcibly of our late experience in trying to interest the Europeans of Auckland and suburbs. He reports but one baptism in the past three months. I am pleased to report that the work progresses favor- ably in this part of the mission, though we have many things to contend with, the natives being so weak, and we are occasionally obliged to take action against members for their persistent evil practices, and particularly for their running after the Moari priests, or workers in witchcraft and Moari superstitions  We recently visited a small neighboring island and God so blessed us that we were permitted to add 52 souls to the fold. We were met and opposed by satan who took possession of one of the females there, but by the power of the priesthood of God, and in the name of his Son, he was cast out, the afflicted person baptised, and we all rejoiced in the great testimony which was given to us.

Bro. Woolley reports the old gentleman as saying that  "he has no means and that if he returned home the church would have to pay his fares."  Pleased to hear that we  are soon to be reinforced with  new elders and will make it a point to meet them in Auck- land, to welcome them to maoridom.

I really feel, from my acquaintance and associations with him, that he will fully appreciate and duly merit the salvation which is now offered him through his repentance.  I was pleased also to learn that two  more Elders were on their way to this field of labor; I will have one of the brethren meet and welcome them to Maoridom.

ENDENTRY He, in connection with others of the elders, has exercised much faith, administered to ordinances, but without the desired effect.

Salt Lake City:  Dear Brother:  It affords me pleas- ure to again write you, and I  am thankful to be able to re- port myself and the Elders  in good health.  Since writing to you from Tautoni,  I in company with Elders Nye  and Cutler, have been down to  the extreme north end of the  island, visiting all of the native  villages, and have had the priv- ilege of bearing our testimony to  many who had never before seen  a Mormon Elder. As a rule we  were kindly received, and attentively  ENDENTRY listened to, but in some places they  were so bitterly prejudiced by  mendacious reports circulated among  them by our enemies that they  would not allow us to hold meet- ings. Wherever we could get a hear- ing, I think we allayed much of  the prejudice and left the people  more favorably impressed with  what the world calls Mormonism.  At one place a European and  several natives desired baptism,  but as we did not think the na- tives sufficiently enlightened, we  advised them to wait till some  future visit of the elders.  There are some fine people in this  section, and I trust that they will  eventually accept the truth.  We are now at the house of  a Half Caste who has a European  ENDENTRY wife and a large family. Tomorrow  we shall have the pleasure of lead- ing him into the waters of baptism,  and his wife being quite favorable,  we hope in time to baptize them  all.  Since writing I have heard from  most of the presidents of districts.  Several excommunications, are  reported but no baptisms showing  that the adversary is still at work;  not only in hardening the hearts and  blinding the minds of the outsiders;  but also in leading astray those  who have been initiated into the  truefold.  I have not heard from the breth- ren in Wright's  return.  Elders Nye and  Dame will be released to return home ENDENTRY next April. Please send us two new  elders to take their place. The mission  is well supplied with elders at present,  but I think it best for two to come  and be acquiring the language,  as another company will be released  about next October  A report is going the rounds  at present to the effect that a  manifesto forbidding the practice  of polygamy has been issued by  the President of the Mormon Church;  and ratified by a mass meeting of  15,000 Mormons. The newspapers are all  commenting upon it, and we are every- where plied with questions concerning  it. Having heard nothing authentic,  we treat this as a rumor of the same  nature as the hundreds of others  which are continually being put in  circulation concerning us, still we ENDENTRY would be pleased to learn from  you whither ^any^ action has been taken  to give foundation to such a report?  The spring has been unusually  cold and stormy, but it is now fine, and  becoming quite warm. The prospect  is that crops will be good, and the na- tives will have plenty of food next win- ter.  They are most all at home  at this season of the year and it is  an excellent time for the Elders to  travel among the outsiders, but as  soon as the season of cultivation is  is over they scatter out into the  gumfields, and it is hard to reach  them. We could not have chosen a  better time for our visit to this end,  as wherever they would receive us at  all we had crowded houses  There have been some riots of late ENDENTRY among the natives of what is known  as the King Country, and several  who are guilty of plundering stores  etc., have been arrested and are now  in custody. We are in hopes that  something will transpire to lessen  the influence of King Tawhio and  Te Kooti, the Maori Prophet, so  that their followers will accept the  gospel. As it is at present they are so  carried away by foolish vagaries that  they will not listen to anything rea- sonable.  The health of the Saints I believe  is generally good. Many are trying  to live their religion, and are mak- ing commendable progress in the  knowledge of the gospel, while others  I am sorry to say are yielding to  temptation, and returning to their "wal- lowing in the mire."  ENDENTRY Some are becoming anxious to go  to Kiona, (Zion), but I think it quite  wise to help them here until they prove themselves worthy.  There are, no doubt, a few worthy  persons who, surrounded as they are by the contaminating influences of  the world, yield to temptation, while  under more favorable circumstances  they might perhaps endure faithful;  but in my opinion there are many  more who would eventually fall  away even were they permitted to  emigrate, and it is far better to purge  them out and have them here than  to take them to Zion. There is too much  dross there already. I find that many  have been baptized without a knowl edge of the gospel, and my experience  is that it is more difficult to convert  a person after baptism than before.  ENDENTRY Most of the European Saints are la- boring with a view to going to Utah,  but some of them are in very poor  circumstances being destitute of all  comforts, and having barely sufficient  to sustain life.  I will not weary you further.  Hoping to hear from you soon,  and continually praying for the  onward progress of truth and right- eousness, I remain as ever  Your Brother in Christ,  J. S. Bingham  Address, General P. O.  Auckland ENDENTRY Tantoru Oct. 25 1890  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Box B., Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  It now becomes  my pleasant duty to write you, and inform you of my where abouts.  Your letter informing me of my appointment to the presi- dency of the Australasion Mission came to hand by due course of mail and was, it is useless to say, a great surprise to me. I feel very weak in having to assume so great respon- sibility, but I sincerely hope and trust that God in His infinite mercy will bless me with wis- dom, and bestow upon me all ENDENTRY other qualifications requisite to the proper performance of all labors and duties connected with the  management of His affairs in this land, as I earnestly desire to magnify my calling acceptably and for the interest of the mission.  Since the departure of Prest. Wright and companions for home, I have been traveling in the Bay of Islands District in company with Elders Nye and Hixson. We have had the pleasure of baptizing eight persons.  On account of scarcity of food and for other reasons we thought it not advisable to hold any conferences  in this part of the island, so I am traveling through the districts visit- ing the branches and speaking to the people as opportunities are af- forded. It seems that gleaning and ENDENTRY sifting is the process at present, as all of the natives have all heard the testimony of the Elders, and it is quite difficult to awaken any interest.  The Elders I believe are all in good health. Sister Dunford at last account was also well and per- forming her dutises as teacher quite satisfactorily. The school is well patronized, the present enrollment being forty five.  Prest. Wright with the compa- ny of Elders and Saints I suppose will arrive at San Francisco today, and ere this reaches its destination you no doubt will have had an interview with him and learned of the general condition of affairs in the mission  Bro.
