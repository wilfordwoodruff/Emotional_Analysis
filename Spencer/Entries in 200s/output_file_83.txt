I have for some  time been worked upon by the spirit of the  Lord, to go to my native land, Denmark to get  my genealogy. I have written, and sent by  missionaries, but in vain.    I read ^in^ your sermon in the Deseret News, that  we would be under condemnation if we did not  do what was in our power for the salvation of our  dead. I know it is true, and my duty to do what  I can, or I will be held responsible.    I have spoken to President Peterson consernng  this matter. He is willing, and says it is all right,  but ^he^ would like your sanction and consent, if it  is according to your will. I feel myself, that with  the Lord's heelp and the blessings of my brethren  that I will be able to fulfill this mission.    I am past seventy years old but have good health

 two aged parents  80 years old  Mother paralysed & Father  nearly blind, & the times have  pressed hard upon me so that  I am so anxious to sell these  pictures that my Father may  at least enjoy some of the benefits  I am certain of a sale some day  if ever they can be seen by Art  Critics, but it may be too late  when the dear old hands (who have  put on canvas what his fertile  & rich mind created) are folded  across his peaceful breast.  Then  my heart would break to think  he never was appreciated while  living.  Neither was Tition nor  Raphael.  Please think over this  & see what you can do.  I am told  you have magnificent pictures &  if mine are bought I shall feast  my eyes on Salt Lake City.  Pardon  length.  Yours respectfully-  Miss Helen A. Saunders 220 San Pedro  Ave.

 Afton Uinta Co. Wyoming  March 5th 1898    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother  I send you  six more names for missionaries. We occasionally find  a pretty good man who isn not entirely a strict observer  of the Word of Wisdom, but we think he would be if   called on a mission. This is the way with Brother  Gomm whom we have recommended, but he is not by  any means an intemperate man. Land matters sometimes  interfere, and brethren have to wait a few weeks to prove  up, but this difficulty will soon be over.    Very Respectfully Your brother in the Gospel  George Osmond
