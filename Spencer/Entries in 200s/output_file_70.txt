Dear Brother:  I suppose you received the last letter I wrote you and was no doubt supprised, but I have come to the conclusion that I was doing rong and that it was not  the cource in life for me to take. I quit working in DeLamar shortly after I wrote you and have been preparing to fulfill my mission.  ENDENTRY would be the first of March He could then tell what would be His help. on I am expecting to see him in the spring and write to Him soon, and if any thing opens that I can rely on for your assistance I will let you know immediately. their may be men that Have money in philadelphia or Western NY but I do not know them. I will talk with Elder Barnes upon the subject, and if I can stir him up to do any thing I will. As to myself I have to exercise my thinking powers strongly in order to get bread for myself and family and pay my fare in travelling the pond of the Churches in the East seems to be out And almost every man man that comes East to preach to the world has to live upon the Churches. But that does not help you any nor me Neither so I will drop the subject. The gold fever still rages as bad as ever ships are Now clearing daily from New York and Boston ports, loaded to the brim with gold digers, some 200 ships have left for that port to dig gold. I do not mean the ships will dig gold, but the people that went in them. Nearly all the America shiping will turn from most all other trade and go to that country. Hundreds are now preparing for that country, and tens of thousands men. I tan am now expecting O Spencer from Liverpool to be in New York soon I shall go to see him if the Lord will. I am not baptizing  much in this Eastern Country, for three Sabbaths past I have held meetings in Cambridgeport, I have 3 candidates for baptism here whenever we can find any water it is all Starrotyped now in  this country with Ice, one of them is an intelligent gentleman from Switzerland I think He may be useful some day to go to his own country to preach the gospel. The work continues to progress rapidly in England I should think from all accounts they were adding nearly 1000 per month in that country. I was truly rejoiced to hear the news from the valley. Do the presidency intend to take any measures for a Territorial or State government I have watched the Bills that have come up during the present session very closely but  I do not think any Bill will pass this session for any of the country. Slavery is the great Bone of contention, and now presents a formidable appearance and is a laying firm foundation for the disolution and anhi annihilation of the American Government.

LOA, WAYNE COUNTY, UTAH Jan 24th 1898  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother we hereby take the liberty of saying to you in regard to Elder John C Jacobs of the Teasdale ward in this stake, who expects to go on a mission next  spring, that we feel that brother Jacobs will be of little value as a traveling elder in the field on account of his physical condition,  his health is not good, and he is subject to some kind of heart affliction by spells, that in our Judgement would be sufficient grounds for a release from his call, coupled with this while he is making preperations to respond to the call, yet in our opinion he seems to feel quite downcast about it, which is probably on account of his health more than any thing else. Bro. Jacobs is a good man and a willing worker in the kingdom, and we wrote you some time ago asking permission to use him as bishops counsellor,  but we made another selection instead. But we now feel to present his condition to you as stated above, so if you should feel to release him  it might be done before he arranged his business during his absense, or disposed of some property to help cary him to his field of labor, that he would not other-wise dispose of trusting you will pardon these suggestions, we remain your brethren in the gospel  Willis E Robison Hans M.

This arrangement leaves me to travle alone in the  Leek district for the present at any rate, but I dont mind it so much because there are some places where the people are so poor that they are scarcely able to accomodate two but that can get along with all very nicely, so we see as the old say- ing goes there is no great looss without some small gain. Of course I miss at times a companion to talk to and feel a little lonely in consequence. Still I would just about as soon be alone. The days are getting so short and the weather so chilley that we think it adviseable to discontinue ENDENTRY labors with unabating interest and and every evening that the weather will permit of our voices may be heard reverberant through the quiet country viliages after the weary farmer has repaired from his wearisom tail to seek repose beneath his humbel roof or perhaps to loiter at a side road inn or they may be lost in the never ceasing din of the larger towns and cities.

We walked to this place yeasterday and found some warm heated folks to receive us but a very cold house. The rain has ceased and the weather is clear and cold to day.

The work goes on very slowley in the best districts and in some places it seems to be closeing up altogather, but while the work is closeing up in England it  is opening up in other places, as for instance in Belfast and environs-north of Ireland there have ben thirty bapt- isms during the summer and the Elders laboring in that part think there are good prospects of adding many more to the fold, if the efforts of the Elders be maintained. The Elders in the conference are all enjoying pretty good health, the same may be said of all in the mission so far as I know. Am glad to heare that Leslie feels contented. Was quite shocked to heare of the untimely death of my friend John Dunn. You will please excuse the brevity of my letters.

I have just  returned from sister Chambers who lives in another part of the town. God has certainly blessed me with a few godod friends to admin- ister to my wants and this kind  Sister is one of them; although I have only known her for a little over a month it seems that I must have known her for ENDENTRY 4 and habits. You ask me how I like sea sick- ness; well a little goes a long ways. I think England a verry pretty country and if they had our atmosphere so pure and healthfull with about one fourth the present population and they about 400 years more modern in their habits (for they are about that far behind the americans) I would like to live here, but as they are to day if I was offerd one half the Island it would be no inducement. Of course this is an exageration but I am not in love with the country.  Preaching is up hill work for me I fear it is not my forte, still I keep pegging away and may accomplish something in two years. We  have not had any rain for three weeks, the people tell me they dont remember a time when the rain held of so long at once. I learn from from the papers you are having high watters  at home, well I expected as much considering the vast amount of snow there was in the mountains I wrote a letter to mother the other day in answer to one I recieved from her, trust she got it all right. I see by the paper that Welcome is again sentenced to be shot ENDENTRY vinced of the truth yet it takes them some time to muster up courage to embrace it. It is now as in days of old, "Paul may plant, Apollos may water, but God giveth the increase" I do not want you to misconstrue my meaning that the district we are in is a new one entire, but there are several places we have ben to of the old beaten tract which the elders have not visited for many years and one place (Hulmes C Chappel) they had never heard the mormons  preach. The day I posted my last letter to you we preached at Crew a large R. R. centre from which place a person can be booked to any part of the United Kingdom; the elders have not preached there since twenty years ago, when on one occasion at the baptism of some people one woman was accidentily drowned since which time the sound of the gospel has ceased to be heard there. But this is what I want to tell you when we entered ^who meets little success so far as the number of baptism is concerned that in many instances does the most good^ the town I felt verry downcast and the verry ENDENTRY questions on the principles of which I had spoken and I would endeavor to answer them to their entire satisfaction, but no one raised a dissenting voice, so I extricated myself from the crowd and made my way to the depot feeling thankful to the Lord that he had strengthened  me with his Holy Spirit so that I might warn the people. If I did no other good I am satisfied I succeded in allaying any prejudice that might have ben exisitng there. I made the acquaint- ance of a gentleman on the train and preached to him as we sped along over the rails, arrived at Mattram station all ok and repaired to a Saints house near by where I passed the night retiring well satisfied with my days  work conscious of having done my  duty.

ENDENTRY any thing if I could see the fruits of my labors in return. But if there are many more converts made in this country it  will have to be through some special effort of the Almight, for the country is being continualy flooded with misrepres- entation about us as a people. Anti Morm lecturers are doing their utmoast to poison the public mind and close halls and ears against us and this they have succeded in doing very effectualy, for the mere mention of Latter Day Saint or "Mormon" has about the same effect on them as the shaking of a red blanket has on a wild bull. Men who will converse very inteligently on any other subject can hardly talk rationaly on the subject of "mormonism Only yeasterday while in Stockport I saw published in the leading papers and also placarded in themost conspicu- ous places in the town the startling ENDENTRY along under ground over bridges along the tops of the houses and was completely dazed with every thing around me.

I did not mention my feelings to my companion until after the meeting for fear he would think I was getting the blues; but on acquainting him with my feelings I found that he was undergoing a similar experiance. I am satisfied it was the two powers of light and darkness striving for the supremacy that caused sutch a feeling at our meeting; as soon as we left the place on the following morning the feeling left us. That place is the Devels own stronghold and he and his imps have full possession. We are going there again this week, and I hope I shall not have the same experiance for it is a terrible feeling.

Some strangers who have heard soo many absurd and bloodcurdling storries as Mrs. Paddock and writers of her class have industriously circulated about the ENDENTRY -uaded to become a Christian." but from past experiance and from the study of humane nature I have learned not to "count my chickens fefore they are hatched" as in several instances people who have ben brought to a position where they could catch a glimpse of the first ^bright^ rays of the Gospel as they struggled through a rift in the clouds of superstition, have gone back again to ^the^ beggarly ellements of the world behind the dense bank of fog where the "Light of Truth" never penetrates. Elder Chas Denney my late companion has ben released to return home with the company of Saints sailing April the 11th; he has  gone to London to spend the remainder of his time with his rellatives there so I am left once more to prosecute my labors afoot and alone; but this is to me rather a source of satisfaction ENDENTRY 5 I walked from Audley in Stafford- shire to Saltney in Wales three miles from Chester where I tarried for two nights under the hospitable roof of a Mr Hemmings not now a memeber of our church though he was formerly That was the longest Sabath days journey that I remember having taken. For some time I have had a longing desire to pay a visite to  that rare old city of Chester with its many interesting historical asso- ciations and as my favorite mode of locomotion was the cheapest by far I chose it in prefence to all others, and left well repaid for my trouble. The buildings are very quaint and curious; the second story of most of the houses is thrown ENDENTRY months nor before that time that he knew of; well when we got inside I was so tiered and hungry having had no dinner and the heavy road had given me a ravenous appetite, that I just asked the Lord  to provide us with something to  eat, and it was soon made manif- est that He had heard my simple prayer for the good matron was soon buisy prepareing us some supper, and just as we had finished our frugal meal, another sister came in with a nice pc. of cake which we ate for desert. This last named  sister who is a jenuine L.D.S. but who is out at service and conseq- uently has no place to invite the ENDENTRY 5 to behold. The Church of England and the Catholic Church have their line layed so close together  that it would appear to the casual oberserver that they were both runing for the same depot; and it looks as if they would soon be annealed together. The Rev C Stirl- ing deliverd a bold address on this subject last evening, in this place. Perhaps a brief synopsis of the same would not be wholy uninteresting to you from the fact that it paints in vivid colors the feeling that ex- ists between Protestant ^notabely the Methodist^ and Catholic. The lecture was deliverd to a large congregation a ^good^ portion of which ENDENTRY Asahel H.

A heavy mist is hanging over the city and a drizzling rain has ben falling all the foor- noon, takeing it all to gather it is a regular English day. This is a queer climate only last Sunday the heat was so oppresive it was almost impossible to get a breath of fresh air, while the past few days it has ben quite chilley making a place near the glowing  hearth the most desirable place when night comes on. I have before me two letters from you  (Father) dated Aug 1st and 11th the latter came to hand yeasterday on my return from Liverp- ool. I have not recieved any letter from you (Mother) since the one dated July 6th which I  answerd immediately. I also wrote you from Farnworth July the 6th but it seems you must not have recieved it. I will write you again as soon as possible, and trust you will do the same, though I expect there is more work than you know what to do with since ENDENTRY informed that it was a regular den of thieves and disreputable characters of all sorts. As we threaded anyway along the dark and narrow Streets Men and Women could be seen reeling to and  frow on nearly every hand. some of the houses were not  fit actualy for srespectable pigs to live in, and more than once during our rambles my mind adverted from this horrible spec- tacle to my comfortable home in down in the vally reclining. We went to bed about two oclock completely wearied with our day's work, for it was little else. I had decided to take the 5:50 train next  morning for London as that was an express and would o^n^ly stop at a few of the larger places vis Bedford and one or ENDENTRY and ben swept overboard and engulfed in the dark sea of apostacy. May the Lord help me to keep my grip. I stated in my last letter that I was in need of some means to keep up any kind of a respectable appearance and to procure shelter from the inclemency of the weather and something to eat when hungry; and I am sorry to learn that your finances are at sutch a low ebb, but I am willing to use apart of my savings if necessary, and when I am ready to make a start in life perhaps you can give me a lift as you have done my older brothers, and when once started I will make every exertion to keep the thing arooling. I have always had a desire to help myself so as not to be a burden on my hard-working parents  and you have given me ^every^ encouragement. ENDENTRY we remained until the 17 on the 14th we held a meeting on the cattle market to a fair and interested audiance, on the 15th we walked eleven miles and held four services, over at Wetly-racks one at Cheddleton and two at Leek all passed of with verry little interruption went to bed pretty well tired out with our days work oOn the 16th in the evening we walked out to a small hamlet (Leek Brook) for the purpose of preaching to about 60 people who live there; but we were refused the privilage by Mr Wardel the proprietor (he owns the whole hamlet) so we had our walk for nothing still we had done our duty in trying to  warn the people. On the 17 after bidding the  folks good by where we had ben staying, we were soon on our way for Tean. Leaving the turnpike to our right and taking a field road we soon found ourselves in a beautiful little valley through which the Churnet river flows following its bank down for some ten miles we passed through some of the most lovely scenery it is I ever saw. You probably know something about the beuties of English scenery but I doubt if you ever got into as pretty a ENDENTRY "mormons" are greatly surprised at  seeing intelligent live "Mormons" from Utah and this surprise is considerably augmented at seeing portraits of pleasa- nt and intelligent women instead of the despondent and inane look that they are accustomed to believe characterizes the female portion of our community. If you have a photograph of yourself or any member of the family to spare I wish you would be kind enough to send them to me. I have enjoyed myself this month pretty well though alone still I have missed the cheering society of bro Allen for he is a wise counselor and a brave champion on the Lords side. The last company of saints should have sailed from Liverpool on the 25th inst but in consequences of an axidend which befell the Nevada during her passage from New York their departure will be delayed until Nov the 1st when they will leave on the Arizona instead ENDENTRY than regret, for bro. Denney is of sutch a whimsicle nature that he and I could never agree, he had no disposition to study and considered me very unsoci- able because I was so disposed and he was alltogether to aggressive for there to be any affinity existing between us. and while we were together I traveled alone so far as it was practicable for the advancement of the work. So you see I am much better of alone under the  circumstances. I have received an invitation from the Rev A C Cooper of Tiverton Devonshire to pay him a visite; says that he used to have a chapple at Evanston--I think--and that ^you^ preached in  it on several occasions. I think ^it will be^ imprac- ticable for me to accept of the invitation owing to the long distance intervening. We are having a lovely March taken as a whole.

Sometimes, instead of posts, a solid wall supports the house above. You observe, as would be likely in an old city, that the surface is  irregular, that we are ascending a slight elevation.

The beautiful weather the past week and the grand moon light nights makes one feel quite joyous and I feel quite frisky this morning I don't know wheather it is right for a missionary to feel that way or  not. I am traveling this month with no other companion than my Fathers Son, we are just starting out this mo- rning on a two hundred and fifty mile jaunt and anticipates an enjoyable time expect to get back to Manchester abt. the 6th prox. Suppose the missionaries will arrive about that time. I wrote  to mother on the 30th, but have not rec'd a letter from her for a long time I well understand the reason why though, when I remember that she has ENDENTRY 4 Elders to gave us two shillings with which to procure some comf- artable lodgings. We succeded in getting them with a private family where we are now comfortablely quarted. Bro D. has retired and is now snooring lustily, while I am clutching my pen- holder with a determined effort to deface this sheet of paper, and wait for the candle, which is growing beautifuly less, to give out so that I may have a good excuse to retire Of course I acknowledge the ha^n^d of the Lord in providing for our wants this night as he has done otn on several other occasions.

In these days, he said, when P Protestantism was becoming so unfashionable and the Church of the nation was apostatising from that faith which their fathers so valued and slaid down their lives to mai- ntain, he rejoiced that they had a Protestant instituion in Portsmouth whos object was the defense of those true protestant principles which they hoped to hand down to the coming generation.

I think you ought not to have let him gone leave the chores for you to do; pleas give me the dates of the last letter received allways when you write.  I got a letter from Nellie last week but Henry did not say any thing about  his haveing lost a horse though he menti- oned the dificulty they had experianced in preserving the dam, and the loss of their  crops concequent upon their haveing had to neglect them in order that they might protect the dam; it seems to bad that they should have sutch bad luck. You are right I can always find time to read your letters if not to answer all of them. I am begining to come to the conclusion that I must not say anything in my letters but what the whole world might read for it seems that you are letting every one read them that you come in contact with. I am not affraid but what they are truthful reports of my labors— for I always mean to tell the truth— but I am not fond enough of notariety to  to have my name arrayed before the public either through the columns of the "news" or in ENDENTRY two others. Pres Williams is a man that does not believe in wasting  any time around rail way stations so on this, as on other occasions, he timed us to within two or three minutes and did not reckon on  our having to carry a trunk weigh- ing over 50 lbs so when we got there it was time for the train to  start, the baggage car was closed and I had my ticket to get. But the  guard got my trunk in all right and ^I^ got a seat just as the train was  moving out, but there was some some lively work done to accom- plish it you ymay depend upon it. On examining my ticket I found it was for St. Pancre's Station instead of Victoria as it should be, so when I got in to the first station in London I had to change cars.

We are improving our time tracting, talcking to the people in their homes and leaving our testimony far and wide.

We visited the Cansal flint mills in this valley where the material is prepared for making potteryware with, the process is quite an interesting one.

Well we started  our meeting up expecting to walk afterwards seven miles to the nearest stopping place, so judge of our surprize when at the close a lady came up and asked us where we were going to stay for the night and on our telling her  we had no place in the town to stay she invited us to go to supper with her ENDENTRY of the Nevada as was originaly inten^(ded^ When about about two days out from Queenstown fire was discoverd issuing from the tween decks where was stowed a quantity of bales of cotton, by the united efforts of the crew and passangers the flames were soon got under controll but notwithstanding they pumped ten feet of water in to the hold the mass continu- ed to smoulder untill their arrival in Liverpool. A good many bales were thrown overboard. Spontaneous combustion is  supposed to be the cause. The Bretheren had quite a turbulent meeting in Nottingham at their last conference in that place. Wm Jarman the famous or rather in-famous anti"mormon" lecturer with about half a doz other Apostates came to the afternoon serv- ice obviously for the purpose of creating a disturbance; when the meeting was about to be dismissed crazy Jarman jumped upon the stand and commenced to address the  congregation when he was requested to  leave the room but he this he refused.
