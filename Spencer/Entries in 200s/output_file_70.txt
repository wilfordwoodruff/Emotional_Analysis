Miller of Parker in response to your  call upon him to go on a mission to  the Southern States. Bishop Carbine who  endorses said letter also says in regard  to Brother Workman who also has been  called from Parker ward that Brother  Workman has answered you direct that  he will go but the Bishop does not  think he should go for the reason that  he is 60 years old in July and his health  is not good one lung is nearly gone and  he takes cold very readily.

 Salt Lake City, Jan 7th 1895    President Woodruff:    Dear Brother:    Having received a call to fill a mission to  Australasia to leave Vancouver Feb 16th 1895. I feel that it is proper  for me to submit to you a statement of my financial condition:    I have recently purchased land and built a house for a home,  for which I now owe to the Building Society $60000 secured by a Trust  Deed on the property and on which debt I have to pay interest and dues to the  amount of $1050 per month. I also owe to Thos. Quayle, of Oakland, Cal. $47200  on a promissory note, bearing interest at 9%. My only income is what I  receive from my wages as a printer, and I have no means to pay the debts  named nor have I any money on hand. I am 26 years of age and have  a family of wife, and two children: one 2 years, and the other 3 months old.  Neither I or my wife have any relatives who are in a position to give us financial  aid. I thought it only proper that I should render this statement of my  affairs that you should have an understanding of the same.    Your brother in the Gospel,  Thomas A. Callester    Let him be excused, until he is free  to go. I hope he may work to that end  and succeed sooner than he foresees. J.F.S.

Reynolds the   Southern State mission was referred to as my  field of labor. Since then I had a chat   with Bro. Fjeldsted and he thought I would  be wanted in Scandinavia.

Apostle Anton Lund is well acquainted with  me and from him you will learn that  I was born in Copenhagen and received my   education there up till my fifteenth year.

 B. W. Davis  Nov. 24 [18]96    All men are at liberty to Seek  homes for them selves where they  can best find or secure them.  But it is desirable for the  Saints to gather together as  much as possible and not  scatter abroad. The preservation  of our families from the   Spirit of the world, and  from apostasy, or depart-  ure from the faith depends  largely upon our dwelling  together and thereby giving  them the advantages of  the instructions & teaching of  the church schools, and meetings.  It is almost impossible to raise  children in the faith of the  gospel out in the world  where there are no facilities  for church or gospel instruct-  ions. This is a gathering dis-  pensation &c.

He says he will go if he knew  that he would die before he shou-  ld get back.    Still he thinks if he could have  a  little more time before starting  it would help him materially on  account of the lack of money just  now; he is in debt and paying some  interest! but what of that.

 I have fifty dollars I expected to   have used to go back to Canada, but  for some reason to me unknown I ha-  ve been kept from going; and am now  willing to forego what I had thought  was imperative; the will of the Lord  be done, as I wish that to be foremost.  He is almost my only hope to continue  my name on the earth, he is 26 years  old and is not married.    He is to particular and has been  courting a long time; too long perhaps  I have told him I only courted three  women in all my life ^&^ those I marri  ed, and have touched no others.  I never courted three weeks with   all of them before marriage.    He is keeping company with a girl  whose Father is not a good Latter  day saint to say the least.

 TEMPLE.  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.    I would rather he did not  marry under the circumstan-  ces until he gets home from his Mis  sion as hard as it might seem.  I think it might prove a detriment  to his usefulness on his Mission, and  a burden on us at home.    Our lot is close on account of a lack   of means not now in hand.  I believe that we could raise 100   dollars, if that would do for the pres-  ent. I also believe should you so  counsel the sooner he goes the easi  er it would be to overcome; that  has been my experience.    My doctrine has been to have as lig  ht a strain on me from home as possi  ble.

The union of their valleys made perhaps the  richest tract of sugar cane and rice land in Mexico.  The ground slopes back into the hills over  looking the lake—a lovely landscape.  This higher part by its proximity to the gulf  is the choicest coffee land.    The lands between are peculiarly adapted to  different fruits and crops, including a

The Spirit of God had   borne record to the First Presidency,   the Twelve and the elders generally   that we should be delivered from the   hands of our enemies, and the Spirit of   the Lord never lied; hence we were en-  abled to listen to the voice of our Presi-  dent to-day. The leaders of this peo-  ple had been constantly inspired by  revelations from God.    The speaker prophesied, in the name   of Israel's God, that the church would   never be without a law given from that  time henceforth and forever.

 THE DESERET NEWS. Oct. 8    Priesthood Meeting. — A meeting of   the Priesthood was held in the Taber-  nacle last evening, commencing at 7  o'clock, and a large congregation as-  sembled. The speakers were Presi-  dent John Taylor and President Wil-  ford Woodruff. The former delivered   an elaborate and interesting discourse  upon the Priesthood, both Aaronic  and Melchisedec, the Gospel and the  Mediation, the designs of God in the  creation of the earth, the fall of Adam   and the ultimate redemption of the  world and its inhabitants.    President Woodruff, in the course of  his remarks referred to a circumstance  that took place at Kirtland fifty   years ago last April, on the oc-  casion of his first seeing and hearing   the Prophet Joseph Smith. The latter  at a Priesthood meeting called to as-  semble in a little log house, after a  number of Elders had testified, arose  and prophesied that this work would   yet fill the earth, and that the Latter-  day Saints would fill the Rocky Moun-  tains, and with the Lamanites would  build up the Zion of God. The speaker  said he little thought then that he   would see the Rocky Mountains, much  less live to witness the fulfillment of   Joseph's prophecy. He also testified  to the utter fulfillment of the Prophet's   words in the triumph of truth and the   overthrow of Babylon.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Wilford Woodruff  Remarked that as a few moments  yet remained before the service of that  afternoon closed, he desired to occupy  the remainder of the time. He had  been very much afflicted during the  last three or four days--so much so that  he at one time feared he would not be  able to speak at this Conference at all.  However, he had some things upon  his mind that he would like to say to  the Latter-day Saints before the Con-  ference ended, and there were a few  he might mention that afternoon.  Referring to the subjects treated upon  by the preceding speaker, President  Woodruff said the Lord had labored  from the creation of the world to do all  that He could, consistent with the  agency of men, to fit them for  the highest glory they were  capable of receiving; and from the  days of Father Adam down to our  day, whenever the Lord had a people  on the earth who would obey Him, He  had raised up Prophets and Apostles  and given unto them the Holy Priest-  hood and the keys and powers thereof,  that they might administer to the sons  and daughters of Adam and prepare  them for celestial glory. But under  that law, under the administration of  those men, the opposition of the world  had been encountered; and whenever  men undertook to live righteous lives  and keep the law of God they had to  suffer persecution.    The Lord had promised through the  mouths of the ancient Patriarchs and  Apostles, for thousands of years  that are past and gone, that  in the latter days He would  send the fulness of the everlasting  Gospel to the children of men; that He  would raise up Prophets and Apostles;  that He would organize His Church  and Kingdom on earth; that He would  raise up men to go forth for the last  time and prune his vineyard with a  mighty pruning, to prepare for  the coming of the Son of Man. The  sons of Israel today who dwelt in the  congregation before him were a  class of those men. God had  called them from the nations  of the earth -- Apostles, Prophets,  Elders, Seventies and High Priests,  and the Lesser Priesthood, to labor in  the vineyard for the last time, to  gather out the inhabitants of the earth  as far as they would listen to the testi-  mony borne to them, calling upon  them to prepare for the great work of  God which was at their doors. The  Elders of Israel had traveled tens of  thousands of miles to accomplish this.    The conduct of the Latter-day  Saints should be very different from  the rest of the world, who did not pro-  fess these things. The Kingdom of  God was here upon the earth in its  fulness. There were many things be-  longing to this Church and Kingdom  which were not looked for in the world.  One of these was union. That was a  law of God belonging to the Latter-  day Saints. Like the ancient Prophets  and Apostles, the modern Prophets and  Apostles should be united in their  work in the flesh; and we as a people  should not deviate from this rule.  There should be unity throughout, a  unity of heart and mind, from the Pres-  ident of the Church and his two coun-

 THE   DESERET WEEKLY  PIONEER PUBLICATION  ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.  ESTABLISHED TRUTH AND LIBERTY. JUNE 1850  NO. 17 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH SATURDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1892. VOL. XLV.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  said that through the mercy and provi-  dence of God those present this morn-  ing had been preserved to again at-  tend the semi-annual Conference of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints. Quite a number of our breth-  ren and sisters had passed from this  state of existence into the spirit world   since we last met in Conference. In  turn we should also pass away. While  we had the privilege of meeting togeth-  er in this capacity, he trusted that our  hearts would be united in prayer before  the Lord, that we might enjoy the in-  spiration of Almighty God, the gift of   the Holy Ghost, the spirit of light and   truth, so that we might edify one an-  other in our teachings, counsels, tes-  timonies and administrations. We  needed this blessing day by day, that  we might understand and comprehend   the responsibilities which we were  under to God our Heavenly Father.    When he reflected that this com-  paratively little band of men and wo-  men had been gathered into the   valleys of these mountains, from   all nations under heaven, by the   proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus   Christ, for the purpose of carrying out  the mind and will of God in the age  and dispensation in which we lived,  he realized indeed, as all the Saints  must, that the responsibility resting  upon us, as upon the Saints of God in  every age of the world, was very great.    Like all other dispensations and gen-  erations of men, we were placed here  on a mission. We lived in the spirit   world before we came here: we dwelt   in the presence of God; and it had been   our fortune, or our destiny — call it   which you please — to be born in the  present generation when the God of   Israel had set his hand for the last   time to build up His kingdom upon the  earth, to prepare His people for the   great event which awaits us.    There had been no dispensation   fraught with greater importance than   this, and his desire while we were to-  gether in this Conference was that the  Apostles and Elders who might ad-  dress us should have the spirit of the  Priesthood upon them.    He thanked God that he still  lived — that his life had been   spared until now. When he   looked back upon the past,he real-  ized that the majority of his former  companions — those with whom he had  been associated from the foundation of   this Church — had gone into the spirit  world; and he expected shortly to fol-  low them there.    From the time we were first led into  these mountain valleys by a prophet,   seer and revelator, who was clothed  with the spirit and power of God, until   now, the hand of God had been mani-  fested among the people, and that in   fulfilment of the revelations and proph-  ecies recorded in every book handed  down to us as the word of God to   the children of men.    He sincerely hoped that while we   lived in the flesh we would fully re-  alize all our responsibilities and the  work which is required at our hands.  He desired that the Saints would, as   far as possible during this conference,   lay aside all business cares, and pay  strict attention to the work now before  us — that we might be of one heart and  mind, and be filled with light, truth  and power to receive the teachings of   our brethren. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  Said he realized that there were a   great many persons in this city wait-  ing to go into the Temple in the day   and time appointed unto them,   and it was therefore deemed   inadvisable to continue the   present Conference in this building in  view of the dedication services. The  Lord had been very merciful unto this   people, and he felt thoroughly satis-  fied that His blessing would be  poured out in abundance upon all those  upon theresponded to the call made   upon them for assistance in finishing  the Temple. He rejoiced in the   blessings which the Saints had   enjoyed upon the present oc-  casion in listening to the

 REMARKS  Made at the General Conference of the  Chuch, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake   City, Sunday morning, October 7th,   1894, by  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [REORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]    I feel as though I want to say a few  words to the Latter-day Saints, although  I am in very poor condition physically  to talk to the public. This has been one  of the most interesting conferences I  have ever attended; and if I am allowed  to be proud of anything, I certainly  have felt proud and have rejoiced at  the spirit that has been manifested by  the Apostles in their teachings. One  of the subjects that they have dwelt  upon I desire to speak of, and that is  with regard to the Word of Wisdom.  The brethren have dwelt very strongly  upon this subject, and it is right that  they should. The word of Wisdom  applies to Wilford Woodruff, the Presi-  dent of the Church, and it applies to  all the leaders of Israel, as well as to  the members of the Church; and if  there are any of these leading men who  cannot refrain from using tobacco or  liquor in violation of the Word of Wis-  dom, let them resign, and let others  take their places. As leaders of Israel,  we have no business to indulge in these  things.  There may be things contrary  to the Word of Wisdom that we in-  dulge in-, and that we think we cannot  live without; if we cannot, let us die.    President George Q. Cannon has been  laying before us the truth with re-  gard to the position which we occupy  here. This is the work of God, and we  stand as an example to the world.  Therefore, all of us, from head to foot,  should make up our minds to keep the  commandments of God. If I do not  value my standing, my salvation, my  crown of glory and eternal life more  than I value those things which are  represented as being unwise for us to  use, then I am not fit to occupy my posi-  tion. And this applies to every man in  Israel. We all ought to take a course  whereby we might be justified before  the Lord. We live in the last dispensa-  tion and fulness of times, and we are  placed here to guide and direct the  affairs of the Church of God on the  earth. Hence we ought to be wise men;  we ought to be righteous men, holy  men, temperate men; we ought to be  men that will stand in a position to re-  ceive the Spirit of God to guide and  direct us. If we do not stand in this  position, we are not fit to perform this  work.    Brethren and sisters, give heed to the  teachings that we have received during  this conference. As a people, we are ad-  vancing, and not standing still. We  send Elders abroad, and they report to  us every little while what they are  doing; but there is a class of Elders at  work every week that do not report to  us. You see their works, though you  may not comprehend them. As the  Savior said, "Ye may discern the face  of the sky; but can ye not discern the  signs of the times?" The Latter-day  Saints should observe the signs of the  times. The Lord is fulfiling every-  thing that He has said. There is  nothing given in these records of divine  truth but will have its fulfillment. Mes-  sengers have gone forth in the world  to make the commencement and to  carry out these great events that are  spoken of in the revelations of God. I  think it is time we should improve and  advance. The Lord is going to cut His  work short in righteousness, or no flesh  will be saved. The Lord is at work for  Zion, and He has made no mistake in  calling the Latter-day Saints to these  Rocky Mountains--the everlasting hills  which old father Jacob gave to Joseph  in blessing him. We are here and  laboring to promote the interest and  welfare of the Church of God. I feel  to rejoice at the manifestation of the  Spirit of God during this conference.  Many of us have been in this Church a  good while and are advanced in years.  I hope that what time we remain here  we may spend to good advantage. Let  us try to do our duty in all matters ap-  pertaining to the work of God. I am  thankful for the blessings we enjoy to-  day. Zion is growing. The earth is  advancing. The judgments of God are  approaching. The Lord says:    After your testimony cometh the testimony of  earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the  midst of her, and men shall fall upon the  ground, and shall not be able to stand.    And also cometh the testimony of the voice  of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings,and  the voice of tempests, and the voice of the  waves of the sea, heaving themselves beyond  their bounds.    And all things shall be in commotion; and  surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear  shall come upon all people.    The revelations of God have got to  be fulfilled. When? Some time before  the coming of the Son of Man--and  that is not far off. Therefore, let us try  to live our religion, and set an example  before one another and the world. I  accept the reproof of any Apostle or  Elder if there is any requirement of the  Lord that I am not fulfilling. That is  the way I feel, and I think we all should  feel so. We are greatly blessed in hav-  ing received the Gospel of Christ, in  having received the Priesthood and the  power to go forth and warn the nations,  that they may be left without excuse in  the day of God's judgment. And the  honest and meek of the earth have been  gathered to the mountains of Israel,  that they may stand here in holy places  while the judgments of God overtake  the world. Joseph Smith was raised up  by the power of God, and the Priest-  hood and Apostleship has been with us  from that day to this, and will continue  until Christ comes to reign. Christ has  passed through His trials and afflictions;  He has redeemed the world; He has  gone home, and He sits in glory with  the righteous, and will come with them.  All the prophets and apostles, those of  our day as well as of other generations,  will come with Him. Joseph Smith  stood at the head of the greatest dispen-  sation God ever gave to man.    These things are true. Let us try to do  our duty, walk uprightly before the  Lord, and appreciate the blessings we  enjoy. Let our prayers ascend before  the Lord to assist and guide us in every-  thing, that when we get through with  our work we may be satisfied. If the  eyes of this people were open to com-  prehend the truths of eternity, they  would see the importance of laboring  while the day lasts. Our sons and  daughters, if their eyes were open to  comprehend what lies before them,  would also labor with all their might to  qualify themselves for it, and our sons  would be prepared to go to the nations  to warn them, that their garments shall  be clean from the blood of all men.   Elders are being sent to almost every  part of the earth, and the cloud is be-  ginning to lift from off Zion. The  world is beginning to see us as we are.  They open their eyes and marvel at  what they see here. We are beginning  to be understood better than we have  been, and this will go on until a great  many in the world will feel that Utah is  a good place to live in. Our lakes and  rivers will not overflow and drown us;  but we will be protected from the earth-  quakes, from the cyclones, and from the  judgments that are now overtaking the  world. Very strange things have taken  place during this year, and the judg-  ments of God will continue.    I pray God that His blessings may  rest upon us; that our eyes may be  opened to see, our ears to hear and our  hearts to understand our duty and what  He requires at our hands, that we may  be justified when we get through. We  are all passing along.  Many of our  missions will close in a short time, and  we will go as others have done. Then,  if not before, we will comprehend the  blessings we enjoy. When we get the  other side of the veil we will appreciate  this dispensation in which we live. I  do not know whether we do here or not.  I think many times we do not. I have

The  work of the people of God was ad-  vancing, and in this nation there was  a great change in public feeling taking  place in regard to the Latter-day  Saints, than whom no people had  been more lied about or misrepresented  in the past, since they came to dwell  in the valleys of these mountains. The  world should learn who and what  they were, and what they were doing;  and all they asked was that the truth  should be spoken concerning them.  They had labored in the interest of  their fellowmen. As Latter-day  Saints they had faith that God would  save the whole human family in some  kind of glory, if they were not the sons  of perdition. But all men under  heaven were held responsible be-  fore God for their acts, and if  they committed sin they had to pay  the penalty.    He prayed God that they might all,  as Latter-day Saints, live their religion,  do what God required of them, remem-  ber their prayers, and walk uprightly  before the Lord, and when they reached  the other side of the vail they would  meet with their reward, according to  the works done in the flesh. He prayed  that God's blessing would rest upon this  Conference, that the people would be  united together, and that much good  would result therefrom.

 356  THE DESERET NEWS. -[October 10, 1866.    The Deseret News.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY  ALBERT CARRINGTON EDITOR  Wednesday Oct. 10, 1866.    Elder Wilford Woodruff occupied the   stand and spoke by way of testimony   in a most interesting manner, referring  to the way in which the Lord had work-  ed upon him to receive it; and of the   manner in which God had worked upon   President B. Young and many other  Elders, for the same purpose. He also   spoke of the efforts of the adversary to   destroy those noble spirits who had re-  ceived the truth at an early day of the   Church, and of evil spirits coming to   them in numbers at various times and   places with this object; bearing testi-  mony of having been so attacked in   London, when in company with Elder  George A. Smith, and of three angels   appearing to him who relieved him   from the power and presence of the   wicked spirits. This testimony, he said,   he had never borne publicly before; and  the spirit which accompanied it de-  clared its truth to the immense congre-  gation to whom it was for the first time   given. During his remarks he related   many interesting incidents of the pro-  tecting care which the Lord has exer-  cised over his servants. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  493    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  Said he felt to thank God his Heaven-  ly Father that he had the privilege  this day of standing in the midst of  such a vast congregation in the house   of israel. He also thanked the 10,000  Latter-day Saints whose prayers had  ascended to the Lord in his behalf. By  the power of God and their prayers   he has been preserved until the  present hour. While he did not feel  capable of answering his own thoughts  in reflecting upon the scene through which  the Latter-day Saints as a  people had passed in the years which  were gone, still he assured his hearers  that his heart was full of blessing and   thankfullness towards his brethren and   sisters, and all men who had  desired to do what was right.    This was a day to which he had   looked forward for many years, and  when he reflected upon the hundreds  and thousands of Elders of Israel, and  the Prophets and Apostles with whom  he had been associated, many of whom  had already passed to the other side of  the vail, he marveled at the work which  had thus far been accomplished   and that his own life had been preserved so  long in the midst of this people.    As Latter-day Saints had great   reason for rejoicing before the Lord,   and their hearts should be filled with  gratitude and thanksgiving unto the   Most High for the many blessings   vouchsafed unto them.    When he took a retrospect of their   position and saw what had been ac-  complished through God's mercy, by   this people, since they arrived in these   valleys on the 24th of July, 1847, it  was to him a marvel and a wonder.   Though many of their brethren—   President Brigham Young, who had  led them here, and others who were  formerly associated with them in this  great latter-day work, had passed away  —yet he believed that in the spirit  world today they were deeply inter-  ested and rejoicing in the work in   which the Latter-day Saints were   engaged on this special occasion.    They were expecting (continued  President Woodruff) by the blessing of   God to enter, in a few days hence, the  Temple which had been reared here in   the name of the Lord, by His people;  and he desired in the short time now  at his disposal to bless every Latter-day  Saint from the bottom of his heart for  what they had done towards the  achievement of this grand object. No  call, he believed, had ever been made  upon any people upon the face of the  earth which had met with such a  hearty and universal response as that   for the means to finish the Salt Lake Tem-  ple. He felt to thank the Lord for the  spirit which had been manifested by  the Saints in this respect.    They had erected three temples be-  fore this one in these mountain valleys.   The Elders of Israel had labored un-  ceasingly to attend to the ordinances of  the house of God, both for the living  and the dead; because he need hardly  tell the Latter-day Saints that these  holy temples had been erected for the  redemption of the dead as well as  blessing the living.    The Prophet Joseph Smith laid the  foundation of this Church and King-  dom and revealed those principles  unto us; but no principle had ever been  reve[a]led from God to man which had  given the Latter-day Saints more joy  and consolation than the revelations  whereby the Lord had fulfilled the   prophecy of one of the ancient  prophets, who said that in the last   days He would raise up saviors upon  Mount Zion, while the Kingdom was  the Lord's. That day had come.    He himself well remembered the   time when that revelation was given  —the feeling which thrilled their  hearts and souls when they realized  that in their day and generation they  had the power to go forth and attend   to these ordinances for their dead   progenitors, the same as for those who  were still living in the flesh. They   did not hesitate, as soon as that revela-  tion came, to make a commencement  of this Temple work, and there  were scores of men around him  today who had labored for years  in these temples in this way. He  greatly rejoiced at the thought that  when he himself entered the spirit   world he would meet those of his pro-  genitors who, perhaps, had never  heard the true Gospel, who never saw  a prophet, apostle, or other inspired  man while in the flesh; and as Jesus  went and "preached to the spirits in  prison" in His day, so would those   men who now lived and held the keys  of the Priesthood when they passed   behind the veil also preach to "spirits  in prison," open the prison doors and  let the prisoners free. In all his labors  in the cause of this Gospel, for some  sixty years, there was no kind  of work which he had per-  formed with greater satisfaction than  that of redemption of his dead.   Who could not, indeed, rejoice before   the Lord when he contemplated   the future of this great work in the  Rocky Mountains and the privileges  which they enjoyed?    He was thankful the day had come  when they had the opportunity of   dedicating this Temple unto the Lord,  and into which the vast number of  people who dwell in this region of   country would be able to enter and  perform the ordinances required of  them without having to travel long  distances, as had been the case  hitherto.    He had seen some serious  times in the history of this  Church—at Kirtland for instance;   but when he first heard Joseph  Smith preach he knew that he was a  Prophet of God. Of that he then had  all the testimony he needed. The  Prophet Joseph, however, had labored  in the cause of this Church and King-  dom about fourteen years only from  the time of his ordination until he was  martyred. He nevertheless performed  a great mission.    At his own advanced age he thanked  God that he was surrounded by a   quorum of Apostles among whom  there existed such a spirit of unity;   they were united as the heart of one  man. He firmly believed that any  one of them would die for him if   needs be, and he would do the  same for either of them should the  Lord require it at his hands.   There was a love between all of them  that the world knew not of—a love  which distinguished all men who bore  the Priesthood from the rest of the  world.    The Lord had always chosen the  weak things of the earth to confound  the wise, as He had promised; and this  was a principle which he (the speaker)  had thought much about from his boy-  hood. His own view was that the Lord  had done this because He desired to  choose an element which He could  handle and make use of. Many of the  Apostles of old were poor fishermen,  but they were ready to yield up their  lives for the Gospel's sake, without any  regard whatever for the honors of the   world.    So in our own day and generation,   Joseph Smith was called an ignorant,  illiterate boy. In some respects he   might have been, as the world under-  stood it; but he was ordained, before  the foundation of the world, to lay the  foundation of the Church and King-  dom of God. Had not this been God's  work, and had it not been sustained  by His power from the very begin-  ning? In proof of this the speaker  instanced the remarkable gathering of  the Saints to these mountains and  their wonderful preservation through  persecution and trial. As with   Joseph Smith, he said, so with  Presidents Brigham Young and 
 596 THE DESERET NEWS. Oct 8    APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF    Said it is a consolation to know that  we are engaged in the work of God;   to live in this day when the eternal   Priesthood has been committed to   men, and when there is an organized   Church of Christ on the earth. We   should be thankful for the privileges  we enjoy in this connection. But few  people comparatively of any age have  been ready to receive the testimony of   Jesus Christ and receive His Gospel.   It is a narrow path to walk in. As we   have learned, no man can live Godly in  Christ Jesus without suffering perse-  cution. There has never been a more   unpopular doctrine among humanity  than that incorporated in the Gospel.   Almost eighteen hundred years elaps-  ed subsequent to the days of the anci-  ent church established by Christ with-  out any one having the privilege of be-  holding the face of a directly authoriz-  ed servant of God. His authority has   been again restored, however, and the   command has been given to go   forth and prune his vineyard for the  last time. We occupy a different posi-  tion from that of any people to whom  a dispensation was ever committed.   Each formerly has been dispelled — driv-  en from the earth — because of the hold  Satan has had over the hearts of men,  but this dispensation cannot be re-  moved. A promise has been given that  it shall remain until the purposes of   the Most High in relation to the earth  and its inhabitants have been consum-  mated.    We have been ordained of God to   build temples, go therein and redeem   our dead. This appears to be a special  feature of this work, so far at least as  its extent is concerned. We have had  considerable experience in the organ-  ization of the Priesthood in its various  ramifications. We have the various  quorums in their order, and in the sev-  eral organizations the brethren should   meet often together and instruct each   other in the duties of their callings.   All men in their several capacities  should improve thetr time and talents,  that the power of God may be   increased. The Word of Wisdom  should be obeyed. The Spirit of God   will not dwell in unholy temples. We  are held responsible for the declara-  tion of the Gospel to the Gentiles first  and then to the House of Israel. We  have gone to nearly every nation where   openings could be made for the intro-  duction of the Gospel, and our efforts   must not be slackened. There are the   Lamanites, who are a fallen and de-  graded people. God has given us a  knowledge of the history of their fore  fathers. We have endeavored to teach   them to reform from shedding the   blood of their fellowmen, and those  instructions have had a salutary effect   upon them. It is our duty to teach  them both by precept and example.   After the Gentiles entirely turn from   the Gospel it will be taken to the  Jews. How long it will be before that   will take place does not appear.  God has, as stated by President  Taylor, greatly blessed us, and we  should dedicate our entire substance  to the Lord. We are all on this earth  on missions, and we have no other   legitimate business than to build up  the Kingdom of God, concerning the  glorious future of which we have no  doubt, as it will prevail and stand for-  ever, in accordance with the predic-  tions of the prophets. The speaker  continued to speak for some time upon  the free agency of man and the promi-  ses of God to the faithful.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Truth and Liberty.  No. 17. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 14, 1894. VOL. XLVIII    ANNUAL CONFERENCE.  The Sixty-Fourth General Anniver-  sary of the Church.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  delivered a brief opening address. He  expressed his gratitude to God for the  privilege the Saints enjoyed in assem-  bling in the Sixty-fourth Annual Con-  ference of the Church, and that there were   present the entire First Presi-  dency, ten of the Twelve Apostles,  and other members of organizations   and authorities. It was a mat-  ter of congratulation that the  work of the Lord was progressing  at home and in the nations. The Lord  was with us and would continue to be  so long as we sought the salvation of  our fellowmen and performed our  duties. The President spoke of the  testimonies which had been borne and  left on record by all the holy prophets,  from Adam down, concerning the  raising up of a Prophet in the latter  days to establish the Church of Christ  in fulness and prepare a people to meet  the Savior when he should come to  reign during the millennium as King  of Israel. He concluded by express-  ing a fervent desire that the spirit of  inspiration and revelation might rest  upon speakers and hearers during the  present Conference. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  Truth and Liberty.  No. 17.  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 13, 1895.  VOL. L.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  said: I feel that all our hearts this   morning should be filled with grati-  tude and thanksgiving to God, our   Heavenly Father, for the blessings   which we as a people enjoy. A long   generation, as men count time, has  passed away with all its events con-  nected with the last dispensation of the  fullness of times, in our day and gen-  eration. The Church of Christ has   been organized in fulfilment of the   revelations of God, which were given by  men who were moved upon by the gift   of the Holy Ghost in their day and   generation. Many nations and the   islands of the sea have heard the proc-  lamation of the Gospel. The Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   has been organized, not only here, but   among many nations, and tens of   thousands of the sons of God have been   gathered together, here in the land of   Zion. The Gospel has been preached  according to the promises of God unto   the nations, by men who have been   called and sent forth to warn the in-  habitants of the earth of those great  events which are to come to pass before   the coming of the Son of Man.    We ourselves have passed through  many of those scenes which have been  prophesied of by the ancient Patriarchs   and Prophets called of God, and today   we dwell here in the mountains of   Israel. The Lord has enabled His people  to rear temples to the name of the Most  High God, here and in other parts of   the earth; here the dead have been re-  deemed and the living blessed, and the   promises of God have been carried out  according to His words to holy men   from Abraham to Joseph Smith. I   feel myself that we should be filled   with gratitude for the blessings we en-  joy from time to time. I hope and   pray that while we assemble together  we may enjoy the Spirit of God and   our hearts be united together as the  heart of one man; that our prayers   may be drawn out before the Lord, that  His blessings may be with us and that   those who speak to us may do so by   the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and   the power of God.    I feel to thank God for myself that   I have lived to see this day and have  mingled with the brethren for so many  years, and my life has still   been preserved so that I may   endeavor to do something with the   Saints for the redemption of the chil-  dren of men. I hope and pray that  the blessings and power of God may   rest upon the Apostles and Elders and   the Saints of God while we are to-  gether upon this occason. This is my   desire and prayer unto the Lord my  God in the name of Jesus Christ.   Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY 583    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  made a few closing remarks, in the   course of which he bore testimony to  the excellence of the instructions given  by Presidents Cannon and Smith, and  closed with an exhortation to the Saints  to be prompt and liberal in paying   their offerings for the support of the   poor. 
 494  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    John Taylor. Could they have   been bought with gold or turned   away from the work with which they   had identified themselves? No; they   were a class of men whom the Lord   could handle and make use of, and the   same remark applied to hundreds and   thousands of Elders in Israel today   who had been called from the plow   and hammer, and many of whom had   gone forth among the nations, carrying   the Gospel message, without purse   or scrip.    This is the work of God and not of   man; therefore let us try to live our   religion, to do our duty, and to magni-  fy our calling during the little   time we have to live here   on earth. Through all our trials,   afflictions and tribulations we are   growing here upon the tops of the   mountains, in fulfillment of God's   commands. The Lord is watching   over us. Let us not be discouraged,   but seek to do what is right. Remem-  ber your prayers before the lord, keep   the faith, and live in the way that you   may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord; so   that when we get through our mission   here, our works will follow us to the   other side of the vail. I pray God to   bless you and to pour out His Holy   Spirit upon this people. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY 211    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  then arose and said: "Blessed are the   dead which die in the Lord from   henceforth: Yes, saith the Spirit, that  they may rest from their labors; and   their works do follow them."    If there is a spirit on earth who will   rest from his labors it is Brother Abra-  ham Hoagland Cannon, whose body   lies before us this afternoon; and his  works will surely follow him. I have  almost felt that his labors were too  much. He was overwhelmed with   labor and care. He labored for the   benefit of Israel, for his brethren, for   the work of God; and certainly his de-  parture from us is a heavy blow to us   all. It is not confined to his wives and   children, his father, his friends and  relatives; but it rests upon us all; we  all feel the weight and force of it. I   want to say a few words to his   family and friends in relation to this   blow that has fallen upon us as   a Church, as a people, as well   as upon his family. I will say that his   father, President George Q. Cannon,   has received this with all that patience   and humility that belong to his charac-  ter. I have hardly ever seen a man   called to part with a son as he has   exhibit the same composure and recon-  ciliation to the will of God as Brother   Cannon has. As to his brothers and   sisters, it is a blow to them all. It has   come suddenly upon them—unexpect-  ed, we may say; and, of course, it is a   trial. But there are two sides to this   question. With regard to his wives   and children, I want to say a few   words upon that subject. I do not  intend to talk long; but in order to an-  swer my mind with regard to his fam-  ily I have to pursue a course. I have   never pursued before this people or   before the world appertaining to this   subject. I want to refer to the   plurality of wives and to the   plurality of families that men   possess in this Church. It is a subject   I have left alone as a general thing in   all my observations and instructions   before the public. I refer to it now   because I want to allude to Brother   Abraham's character.    The course he has pursued has been   before the world and the people. It  has not been hid behind a bushel. Nor   has been the course that the Latter-  day Saints have pursued. It has been   different in a great measure, from that   of the inhabitants of the earth in our   day and generation. We have had a  plurality of wives and families. The   principle was introduced to this peo-  ple by the revelation of God through   the Prophet Joseph Smith. This was   carried out and practiced by a small   percentage of the Latter-day Saints,   until the time came when the law of   the land forbade our carrying out that   principle, and we submitted to the   laws of the land, as a body and as a   people, with regard to this principle.   But I want to say this—and I want   you to hear it; there is not one par-  ticle of law on any statute   book of the United States, or a ruling   of any court, from the district court to   the Supreme court of the United States,   or by the President of the United   States, or his cabinet, or the Congress   of the United States, wherein a man   who has received wives and children   under the law of God is required to   cast those wives and children into the  street and make vagabonds of them.    No such law as this had been given,   and if there were such a law it would   be a very cruel one. Inasmuch as  these women have been taken under  the law, and have given themselves to   our care, and have done so righteously,   in virtue of holiness and uprightness  before the Lord, is any man justified   in casting these women and children   into the streets? No. And any man  in this Church who has got a plurality   of wives, given to him under the law   of the Lord, who will not feed   and clothes those wives and children,   and educate, and take care of them,   he is under condemnation before God.   No man is justified in that. If   I have any wives given to me of the   Lord, it is my duty to take care of   them, and to take care of their chil-  dren, feed and clothe and educate   them, and do what I can for their   benefit. Why? Because they belong   to me. They do not belong to any-  body else, but will be mine in time   and in eternity, if I do my duty and   keep the commandments of God. And   so it is with you. I hope there is not   a man in this Church that will feel to   cast off his wives and children because   of the laws that have been enacted for   our benefit.    Brother Cannon has carried this   principle out to perfection. He has  thoroughly provided for his wives, as   far as I know, all alike. He has done  all in his power to lay a foundation to   make them comfortable after his de-  parture. He has done the same by   his children. And he has been blessed in   this principle. Therefore, I con-  sider he is justified. He has   finished his work here. He has   gone into the spirit world. His   mother is there, and, I suppose   with him now. I have no doubt that   they are rejoicing together. But he    has left a family. He has done all a   mortal man could do to leave them  comfortable after his departure.    Brother Cannon has been a very   peculiar man. He has been a man   that never has complained scarcely of   anything on earth. He has been will-  ing to take a great load upon him, and   to do all that he could for the benefit of   the Church and of his brethren wher-  ever he has been. Of course, his labors  are cut short, suddenly. But he  awaits the morning of the resurrection,   the coming forth with his wives and   children, his father and mother, family   and friends, to be united with them   upon that occasion.    I want to say to the children of   Brother Abraham Cannon. It will be   but a little while till your father will   be with you, standing in his immortal  body and glory, that death cannot   destroy nor affect. When I look and   reflect upon this Church, upon the  blessings and revelations of God, upon the  salvation of God, I consider that of   all men and women under heaven we   have the greatest reason to rejoice be-  fore the Lord. We have had a good  deal to do in our day and time, but   the Lord has assisted us in performing   this work. One goes, and another   comes. I look around me, and how   many there are departed from us! Yes,   a large host have left this Church here  and gone to the grave with their   bodies, while their spirits are in the   spirit world preparing to return with   the Lord Jesus Christ when He shall   come in the clouds of heaven to reward   every man according to the deeds done   in the body. When I reflect upon   this, and realize what a little time will   elapse before Abraham Cannon will   stand with his family and friends and   the Saints of God in glory, In immortal   bodies, I think these things should   comfort us, and comfort our children   and our families.    Brethren and sisters, I find myself   hoarse, and I do not feel that I can  talk much. But I felt I wanted to say   so much to my friends and to my  brethren and sisters. I say, God bless  you. May God bless the father of Broth-  er Abraham, and bless his wives and   his children, his brothers and sisters,   and all the family. They are a family that   have been united in love. They   have had a good example set them.    The blessings of God have been over  them. I hope and trust we may all   pursue that course that we may be   justified and be prepared to pass to the   other side of the veil as he has done.   God grant it, for Christ's sake. Amen.

You have therein granted  me permission to postpone the same  until I had emigrated my parents.  You must have misunderstood me  for I did not (if I recollect right)  ask for such a postponement, but only  for time long enough to consult my  parents wishes in that matter in  which the sacrifice will fall on  their part as the means I saved up  for them will have to be used for  this mission. Yesterday I received  their answer soand it was a great  comfort to me to hear my good old  mother not only give her consent, but  faithfully commending me to accept   any such calls and trust in the  Lord for the rest.

 I have written to my aged  parents in Switzerland to ascertain  if they would be willing to  have mye use the little means  I saved for their emigration in  this cause. However I have little  doubt but that my dear old   mother who always was a faith-  ful member of our church, will  be perfectly willing to make  the sacrifice. Yet I felt  I it my duty as her son to  ask her advise and hope that  you will pardon me for the  further delay. As far as I' am  concerned I fully appreciate the  call, I thank you for it, but  I accept it with fear and  trembling. If my mothers  answer is favorable, I'll let  you know as soon as I get  it. If not, I hope that    you will extend my  time considering that I am a poor  sheepherder with no means, only what  I earn and I am my old parents  only child. It is also but  just a year since I successfully  finished my first mission, namely  a course of 20 weeks for the  M. I. Association at the B. Y. A.  Provo. That Mission took the  means I previously saved and  this one will take more than  what I have been able to lay by  since then.    Concluding permit me to  draw your attention to a point  which you have not been informed  of.

 Bishop Orson F. Whitney read in a  clear and distinct voice the following  EPISTLE.  To the Officers and Members of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints in General Conference  assembled.    DEAR BRETHREN AND SISTERS:    At each of the past six General Con-  ferences of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints there has been an  Epistle from the Presidency of the  [C]hurch read to the assembled officers  and Saints and published for the beoe-  fit of those who were prevented from  being present at the Conference.  The reasons for this are well  known to the Church and the  world. A number of the Apostles have  been unable to personally attend these  Conferences or other open gatherings.  Their voices have not been heard in-  structing, encouraging, strengthening  and warning the Saints, or in the dis-  charge of the other public duties which  devolve upon them in connection with  their ministry. It was proper, there-  fore, that Epistles should be written to  the Church in which counsel could be  given and testimony be borne. While  this condition of affairs, so far as these  Apostles are concerned, still remains  unchanged, the instructions upon    (Continued on Page 204.)

 President Wilford Woodruff said:  Sixty years ago, last Sabbath this  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints was organized in Fayette,  Seneca County, New York. It was  organized by the Prophet of God,  Joseph Smith. It was organized by  the commandments of God--by the  revelations of Jesus Christ. Its his-  tory is before the world, the heavens  and the earth; and I feel myself that

 President Wilford Woodruff    Said: Before the close of the  meeting I have a request I want to  make of these Apostles, these High  Priests, Seventies and Elders, and  the Lesser Priesthood and all the  Latter-day Saints who have any  communion with God or with the  Holy Ghost. Brother Merrill has  been talking of revelation. If there  was ever a time since God made the  world that the inhabitants of the  earth needed revelation, it is today.  Now, the Lord has given us the  stick of Judah—the law of God to  the Jews—which reaches down to  our day and generation, and which  shows us their history and has told  us what would come to pass with  them and what will come to pass in  the future. So has the Lord given us  the stick of Ephraim—the stick of  Joseph in the hands of Ephraim  —giving the history of the  inhabitants of this continent  and what shall take place in the  last days. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] I hold in my hands  a code of revelation (the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants) given to  Joseph Smith, the Prophet. There  are some of the most sublime revela-  tions in that book God ever gave to  any generation, or to any prophet  or people under heaven. This book  of revelations, like other records,  will go down to the end of time and  into eternity. These revelations give  you the whole history of the celes-  tial kingdom, of the terrestrial king-  dom and of the telestial Kingdom  of our God. But we want revela-  tion every day. Well, you say, the  President of the Church should give  revelation. Yes, it is true, the  President holds the keys of giving  revelation to the Latter-day Saints.  But is he alone to give revelation?  No, verily, not. There is not an  Apostle in this Church, there is not  an Elder in this Church that stands  up in this congregation to teach this  people, but should be full of revela-  tion. There is where your revela-  tion should come—from those who  teach you day by day.    How many revelations did Brig-  ham Young give that were written  to the people? Very few. How  many has John Taylor given that   were written to the people? Very  few. How many has Wilford Wood-  ruff given? Very few. We have

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Woodruff  Stated that it had been customary for  some time past to read reports and   present the authorities of the Church  to the general assembly on the last  day of Conference. There would be a   departure from that rule this time so   as to reserve tomorrow exclusively  for preaching, and the presentations  would be made this afternoon.    President George Q. Cannon  stated that as some of the Presi-  dents of Stakes had failed to for-  ward their reports, although they  had been requested to send them,   only an incomplete, general report   could be made up, and the reading   of it would be dispensed with.    President Wilford Woodruff  was the first speaker. Following is  a brief synopsis of his discourse: I   feel that every heart in this congre-  gation should be filled with grati-  tude and thanksgiving to our   Heavenly Father for the blessings  which we enjoy this morning, that  so many of us have the privilege of   meeting in this Tabernacle in peace  and quietude to worship Him.  Neither the President of this  Church, nor his Counselors, nor the  Twelve Apostles, nor any man who  dwells in the flesh has any power of  himself to instruct or edify the   Saints; he can only do so  by the power and blessing  of the Almighty. We are all  dependent upon the Lord. The  Prophet Joseph was a humble man;  he was chosen as one of the weak in-  struments in the hands of the Lord,   raised up in this last dispensation to  lay the foundation of this great  Church and kingdom of God upon  the earth. He was taught by the  administration of angels. He knew  full well that his strength lay in  God and not in himself; and that is  our condition at the present time.  Whenever the President of this  Church or any of those in authority  feel in their hearts that the Lord can-  not do without them in the carrying  on of His work they stand on slippery   ground. What did Joseph Smith  say when Oliver cowdery told him  that he was the second apostle in   this Church and kingdom and that  if he left the Church it would fall?  His reply was, "Oliver, you try it."  Oliver Cowdery did try it, and he  fell, but the kingdom did not.  The Lord is not dependent upon   any one man or any set of men for  the carrying on of His work.    We have been called in this day a   generation to go forth and preach  the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the  Gentiles first and then to the house  of Israel. This has been my lot. It

 had some, though not revealed to  the people, perhaps, or published.    But we want revelation every  day. And I want these Apostles  and these Saints to go before the  Lord in your secret places and ask  Him to pour out revelations upon  this people, that we may give you  the word of the Lord while we are  with you, and that these Apostles,  when they speak, may speak by the  power of God, by the Holy Ghost.  Then that will be the word of the  Lord, it will be scripture, it will be  the power of God unto salvation un-  to every one that believes. God  bless you. Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruff  spoke as follows:    In the providence of God we are  again called to pay our last respects and  to attend to the burial of another one of  the Apostles of the Lamb of God,  raised up in the last dispensation and  fulness of times. In the few remarks  which I shall make this morning I  shall not attempt to enter into the  history or life, particularly, of Coun-  selor Wells. This has already been  presented through the press, and will  be fully perhaps by those who may  follow me. It is sufficient for me  to say that Brother Wells has been  in this Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints over forty-five  years. He has been closely allied and  connected with all the Prophets and  Apostles that have been identified  with this Church during that period of  his life. He has been true and faithful  to the Church, to the Kingdom of God,  to the inhabitants of the earth, to the  Presidencies of the Church and to the  Apostles during this period of his life.  It is known to the Latter-day Saints—  many of them, at least—of the diligent  labor which he has been called to pass  through during his sojourn in the  Church and Kingdom of God.    This Church has been organized  sixty-one years the sixth of the coming  month. During that period the Lord  has raised up Prophets and Apostles,  Elders and Saints, many of whom have  laid the foundation of the Church and  Kingdom of God on the earth and have  labored therein. But time has called  them to the other side of the veil. Af-  ter finishing their work here in the  flesh, the Lord has called them home;  and when they pass to the other side of  the veil their missions are not closed;  they have a work to perform there, as  well as they have while tabernacling  in the flesh on the earth. For some  cause or reason unbeknown to me, I  have lived to attend the funerals and  follow to the grave a great share of the  Prophets and Apostles and many of  the Saints who have labored in this  Church in their day and generation.    I will express myself here to my  friends, as I have done on many occa-  sions, with regard to funerals, with  regard to death, and with regard to  going into the spirit world. I have  never felt to mourn in my spirit to fol-  low any Prophet, any Apostle, any  Saint of the living God to the grave  who has been true and faithful to God,  who has been true and faithful to His  covenants, who has received the Gospel  of Jesus Christ and the ordinances  thereof, and the holy Priesthood. Such  men and women have filled their mis-  sion here upon earth with honor, with  labor, with love, until they have been  called home. They have died in the  faith, and they will receive a crown of  glory. Those have been my feelings  in the death of President Young,  Brother Kimball, Brother Taylor, the  Twelve Apostles, and all men who have  received the Gospel of Christ and been  true and faithful in that mission. There  is an eternal reality—which the whole  world will find out—in life. There is an  eternal reality in death. There is an  eternal reality in the resurrection, and  in the future judgments, and in God's  dealings with all men in the future ac-  cording to the deeds done in the body;  and when a man or a woman who has  entered into covenant with the Lord,  who has received the Gospel and the  ordinances thereof, and been true and  faithful in his or her day and genera-  tion, has been called home into  the spirit world, where is the  man who comprehends these  principles that can mourn for  that brother or sister? Here lies be-  fore us the tabernacle of Counselor  Daniel H. Wells. His death has been  sudden to us. I did not know that he  was sick, or that he was in the city, 
 President Wilford Woodruff  said he felt very much gratified in  meeting with so large a congregation  of the Latter-day Saints upon a work-  ing day. It spoke well for Zion and for  the Saints themselves. He had made  up his mind before Brother Thatcher  spoke to occupy a few moments that  afternoon in expressing his views upon  temporal things, and Brother Thatcher  had certainly opened the way leading  to that opportunity.    After dilating upon the work of God  in the beginning of creation, and  showing how our Heavenly Father  placed temporal matters in the  hands of men, the speaker re-  marked that the Lord did not call  upon their enemies to build their Tem-  ples and habitations. The circum-  stances attending the building of Solo-  mon's temple were referred to, and,  turning next to the organization of  this Church, President Woodruff ob-  served that when the pioneers came to 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  added a few remarks on the subject on  which had spoken in the morning  -- the experience of the Church in Kirt-  land, when a number of the Apostles   and other leading men apostatized. He  then exhorted the Saints to serve God.  The[y] could not serve two masters, and   should elect to serve the Almighty and   be united in that service. The Lord   required His Saints to bear off His   kingdom. In doing this they would   have power with the heavens, for the  Lord would not turn His back upon  Zion.    Speaking of the First Presidency  and Twelve, President Woodruff stated  that if ever a body of men were  united they were; the Saints would be  foolish to permit anything to divide   them. 
 general subjects in the previous  Epistles are so copious, and apply so  directly to the entire lives and sur-  roundings of the Saints, that we deem  it not necessary to repeat them at the  present time or to write a lengthy   Epistle.    OPPOSITION CONFRONTING THE   SAINTS    No people of whom we have any  knowledge have been called upon to  pass through such scenes and to have  such a peculiar experience as the  Latter-day Saints. The trials and dif-  ficulties we have had to content with,  so numerous and so varied in char  acter, have scarcely been equalled in  our generation. But those we have  had to meet during the past three or  four years, and which still confront  us, are new even in our experience  They have come upon us in a new  shape. Originating in the same source,  prompted by the same spirit, and de-  signed for the same end, as other plans   which have been put into operation for  our injury and overthrow, the present  attack which is made upon us, differs  largely in many of its features and  methods from anything we have ever  had to encounter. We have been led  to expect from the beginning that as  the work of God grew and developed  in the earth, the resistance to it would  become more formidable and wide-  spread, would increase in intensity  and vigor, and bring into antagonism  to it more influential powers. This  has ever been the voice of prophecy  and testimony unto us concerning the  future of the work of God which  we have espoused. If, then,  we have not been prepared for these  trials which we now have to overcome,  it has not been because we have not  been warned of their approach. By  the testimony of His Spirit and by the  voices of His faithful servants, God  has given His people ample time for  preparation. And the Latter-day  Saints who have lived so as to enjoy  the spirit of their religion have ex-  pected, and have prepared themselves to  meet, such trials as have come upon us,  and others which may yet be in reserve  for us before the final victory is  achieved over Satan and the embattled  powers of darkness.    THE PRIVILEGE OF REVELATION    It is this pre-knowledge which God  has given concerning His work, and  which He constantly imparts as it is  needed to His people, which is one of  the chief causes of the strength pos  sessed by the Latter-day Saints. It is  the principle of revelation from the  Head of the Church to the Church itself  --a principle which in its operation is  not confined to one man, or to three  men, or to twelve men; but is extended  to every individual in the Church, in  greater or less degree, as each one  chooses to avail himself of it There  is an appointed way, however, by  which revelation from the Lord for the  government of His Church is received  There is but one man on the earth,  at a time, who holds this power. But  every individual member has the priv-  ilege of receiving revelation from the  Lord for his guidance in his own af-  fairs and to testify to him concerning  the correctness of public teachings and  movements.    The great promise which accom  panies the preaching of the Gospel, as  revealed from heaven in our day, is  that the Holy Ghost will be bestowed  upon the sincerely penitent who obey  its holy ordinances. Through the  Holy Ghost a knowledge of things  past, present and to come is commun  icated and the mind and will of the  Father made known. In this way the  Almighty reveals His purposes to those  who obey His commandments and  whose lives are pure and acceptable  before Him, so that they can be pre-  pared for all the events and trials that  may lie in their pathway.    If there are any members of the  Church who do not know by their own  experience that this is true, they may  be assured that they do not live up to  their privileges. All Saints should be  in close communion with the Holy  Ghost, and, through it, with the Fa-  ther, or there is danger of their being  overcome of evil and falling by the  wayside.    We, therefore, say to the Latter-day  Saints: The Holy Ghost will not dwell  in an unholy tabernacle. If you would  enjoy the full powers and gifts of your  religion, you must be pure. If you are  guilty of weaknesses, follies and sins,  you must repent of them; that is, you  must thoroughly forsake them. In no  other way can we please God. "Man  of holiness" is His name, and He de-  lights in the efforts of His children to  be pure.    ABSENCE OF OFFICERS OF THE   CHURCH.    We feel led to speak in this strain,  for the reason that while the Latter-  day Saints in order to prosper in their  religion and to increase in the knowl-  edge of God must always live close to  Him, the present is an extraordinary  time which appears to require more  help and strength from the Lord than  usual.  The Church has been left, as  never for so long a time before, with-  out the public ministrations of a num-  ber of the men to whom its members  havelooked for instruction and counsel.  Not only has the number of the  Apostles who could minister in public  been greatly reduced, but the same  causes which have relegated them to  seclusion have had the effect to keep  many Presidents of Stakes and their  counselors, Bishops and their coun-  selors, as well as High Councilors and  other active men in the priesthood,  from officiating in their callings The  people have felt the absence of these  men and the loss of their teachings and  guidance. But has the Lord, on this  account forgotten His people? No,  certainly not. The prayers of the  faithful men of God, who have been  prevented from ministering to the  people, and whose hearts have been  full of love and earnest desire for their  welfare, have been constantly offered  to the Lord that He would have mercy  on His flock, that He would make up to  them, by the more abundant outpour-  ing of His Holy Spirit, for the depriva-  tion to which they have been subjected  in not having the presence of many of  His servants among them.    THE HAND AND PURPOSES OF GOD.    The Savior said, "It is impossible  but that offenses will come; but," he  added, "woe unto them through whom  they come." In our case offences  have come, and it has appeared that we  could not avoid them. Shall we not  acknowledge the hand of God in that  which has taken place in our land and  which affects us so deeply? We who  have seen in all our affairs, and in all  the events which have happened to us,  His providence so visibly manifested,  must feel that the occurrences of the  past three or four years have been per-  mitted by Him for a wise purpose. We  cannot suppose that these happenings  have been by chance and without a de-  sign. God has not so dealt with us in  the past. Mysterious as have been  many things when we had them to en-  counter, time has never failed to throw  light upon and explain them. When  they happened we, perhaps,  acknowledged the hand of  the Lord in them, be  cause of the Lord having said we  should do so; but this was upon the  principle of faith. Afterwards, how-  ever, we have looked back to these  events, and seeing how wondrously  God had wrought, we, in the fullness  of our hearts and in view of the re-  sults, have acknowledged, not in faith  but in developed knowledge, that  God's hand was in all that had oc-  curred. So with the experience, pain-  ful though it be, which we are now  gaining.    God has a purpose to accomplish in  permitting the treatment which we  have received. Whatever the result to  others who have prompted and been  active in pushing it, to us it cannot be  anything but profitable and beneficial,  if we receive it in the right spirit and  bear it patiently. One good effect is  apparent. The Latter-day Saints are  compelled, perhaps to a greater extent  than ever before, to think and act  for themselves and not to depend  so much upon others to lead them.  Some, not having lived so as to have  the presence and guidance of the  Holy Ghost, may stumble and fall.  But those who have lived up to their  privileges will find that God has not  forgotten His promises and has not  left His people to themselves, nor  without a testimony as to the course  they should pursue.    THE SAINTS MUST BE TESTED.    The pathway of the people of God  has been beset with difficulties They  have been environed with dangers.  Dark clouds have almost enshrouded  them. But amidst all these, the still,  small voice of the Spirit of God has  been heard. His Saints have had a  testimony from Him that the course  they have been led to take is the right  one and that He will never fail to  make known His mind and will to  them so long as they live up to His re-  quirements.    It appears plain that it is God's pur-  pose to suffer His Saints to be  thoroughly tried and tested, so that  they may prove their integrity and  know the character of the foundation  upon which they build. Many things  have occurred during the last twelve  months which are well adapted to test  the faith and integrity of the people.  It does not seem possible that those  who do not live so as to have the light  of the Holy Ghost shining in their souls  can escape doubts and fears concern-  ing the work of God.  So many things  have occurred which are entirely dif-  ferent to pre-conceived notions as to  the course that would be taken in  building up Zion that each one needs to  have a knowledge for himself to clear-  ly understand that God is leading us in  the path which we are now pursuing.  To some who are inclined to despond  and to take a gloomy view of affairs,  the ship Zion may, perhaps, appear to  be drifting away from its old moorings,  because things are being done or  movements consented to which, to  their eyes, portend disaster to us and  to the work of God.    UNJUST CRITICISM    There has always been a few among  us who have been filled with evil fore-  bodings, and who have failed to see the  wisdom of God in the steps which His  people have been led to take. They  have questioned and found fault with  the counsel that has been given and  the measures which have been adopted,  and have asserted that revelation had  ceased and the Saints were no longer  guided by men to whom God made  known His will. The prophet Joseph  during his lifetime did not escape the  criticism and censure of this class.  He was often accused of being a fal-  len prophet and of leading the Church  astray. During the long presidency of  President Brigham Young, the same  charges were made, and many aposta-  tized because they believed, as they  stated, that he was no longer led by  the Lord. Experience has proved that  in all such cases those who make these  accusations are themselves in the  dark.    But the faithful people--those who  have lived strictly in accordance with  their profession as Saints and with the  requirements of the Gospel--have  not been assailed by doubts of  this character. There might be many  things which they could not clearly  understand, the reasons for which  might not be fully apparent to them at  the time; but possessing the Spirit of  God, and being led by it, they trusted  in the Lord and felt satisfied to leave  the management of His kingdom and  its affairs to His supreme wisdom.  Time developed to their minds the  correctness of the course which the  Church had been led to adopt. This  has occurred so frequently in our  career that the instances will readily  suggest themselves to those familiar  with our history. In this way, how-  ever, the faith of the people has been  constantly tested.    THE ANOINTING THE SAINTS HAVE   RECEIVED.    The Apostle John, in speaking to the  Saints in his day, said: "But the  anointing which ye have received of  him abideth in you, and ye need not  that any man teach you: but as the  same anointing teacheth you of all  things, and is truth, and is no lie, and  even as it hath taught you, ye shall  abide in him."    The Saints in our days have received  this same anointing and they should  be in a position to not be dependent  upon man to teach and tell them that  which is right. They have had a flood  of instruction given to them in days  that are past. This instruction has  covered the entire policy of building  up the kingdom of God on the earth  Of this continued instruction they have  been to a great extent deprived of late.  It has appeared to be the design of  Providence that they should be left to  show to the heavens, to each other and  to the world whether the truths they  have been taught have had the proper  effect upon them, or not--whether  when left to a certain extent to them-  selves they will be governed in their  daily lives and acts by principle--prin-  ciple to the truth of which testimony  has been borne by the Holy Ghost--or  by the spirit and customs of Baby  lon by which they are surrounded, but  from which they are supposed to be  gathered out.    NECESSITY OF SELF-EXAMINATION.    The present is an appropriate time  for each member of the Church to in-  dulge in self-examination--to measure  his conduct and life in the full  light of the heavenly principles re  vealed to us. Ours is no ordinary  calling. Great opportunities and  privileges have been bestowed upon  us. To us, as a people, has been en-  trusted the grand and glorious labor  of laying the foundation of the king-  dom of God upon the earth. Every  act of our lives should be performed  with this in view. Nothing should be  done by any one calling himself a Lat-  ter-day Saint that will conflict with  the policy which God has announced  as proper to be adopted in establish-  ing that kingdom. In this connec-  tion there are questions which each  one should ask himself: Do I, in all  my words and influence and in all the  transactions of my life, constantly  keep before me the advancement and  prosperity of the Zion of God as the  first and most important considera-  tion? Do I, through covetousness or  a desire for personal profit and advan  tage, depart from that line of conduct  which God, through His Spirit and the  teachings of His servants, has said His  Saints should follow? Do I, by my  words and acts, set such an example  before my family that my children will  grow up to manhood and womanhood  fully imbued with a love of Zion and  with an understanding of the princi  ples upon which Zion will be built up.    Many more questions of a similar  character each one can ask himself in  the process of self-examination. If  these can be answered correctly, there  need be no fears indulged in concern-  ing the effect of the Edmunds-Tucker  law, the confiscation suits, the state  movement, the "boom" as it is called, or  any other measure which may be  adopted either in favor of or against  the Zion of God. Respecting all these  movements, about which there is more  or less agitation and concern and per-  haps excitement, there need be no  fears if the Latter-day Saints will only  be true to the covenants they have  made with their God and strictly carry  out the principles which He has told  us must govern us in the building up  of His Zion.    CONSEQUENCES OF FORGETTING   COVENANTS.    If, however, we forget our cove-  nants, and depart from and disregard  the teachings which He has given us,  then be assured, Latter-day Saints, our  position is full of peril to us God's  purposes will not be thwarted; but we  shall be scourged, and those who per-  sist in this course will be rejected and  be deprived of all share in the bles-  sings promised to Zion. Where those  professing to be Latter-day Saints  knowingly and flagrantly act in  contravention of the counsels  which he has given us, then we have  cause to fear and the plots of the  wicked against us, joined by the foolish  disobedience and rebellion of pro-  fessed Saints, become a serious men-  ace to the peace, prosperity and pro-  gress of Zion.    Praying the Lord to endow every of-  ficer of the Church who desires to  magnify his calling, with every gift and  qualification which belongs to the  Priesthood which he bears, and to fill  the members of the Church with the  Holy Ghost and its gifts.    I remain your Brother and Servant  in Christ Jesus,  WILFORD WOODRUFF    In behalf of the Quorm of the Twelve.  April 6th, 1888. 
 DISCOURSE  Delivered at the General Conference  of the Church, in the Tabernacle,  Salt Lake City, Sunday, October 6th,  1895, by  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-    President Woodruff read from ##Doctrine and Covenants 68|Sec-  tion 68## of the Book of Doctrine and Cov-  enants, as follows:    My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his  ordinance to proclaim the everlasting gospel,  by the Spirit of the everlasting God, from peo-  ple to people, and from land to land, in the  congregations of the wicked, in their syna-  gogues, reasoning with, and expounding all  Scriptures unto them.    And, behold, and lo! this is an ensample  unto all those who were ordained unto this  priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto  them to go forth;    And this is the ensample unto them, that  they shall speak as they are moved unto by  the Holy Ghost,    And whatsoever they shall speak when  moved upon by the Holy Ghost, shall be  scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be  the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the  Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the  power of God unto salvation:    Behold this is the promise of the Lord unto  you, O ye my servants;    Wherefore be of good cheer, and do not fear,  for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by  you; and ye shall bear record of me, even  Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living  God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to  come.    He then said:    I have read these verses this morning  before you that you may understand the  position that I occupy before God, an-  gels and men. I have a desire to speak  a short time to the Latter day Saints;  but I want you to understand, as I have  read here, that I am not capable, nor is  any man capable of teaching the chil-  dren of men and edifying them in the  Gospel of Jesus Christ without the Holy  Spirit, without revelation, without the  inspiration of Almighty God. Therefore,  I want the faith of the Latter day Saints,  and alao [also] their prayers. I need the  Spirit of God to assist me, as does every  man who attempts to teach the people  the things of the kingdom of heaven. I  have been sick for about a week, con-  fined mostly to my bed and room; but I  have felt that I did not wish this confer-  ence to pass without meeting you. For  the last day or two I have had the privi-  lege of mingling with my friends, and I  have a desire to express myself upon  some things appertaining to our day  and generation and to the work of God.    The question arises in the minds of  the people in our day and generation,  Does President Woodruff have revela-  tion? Do his counselors have revelation?  Do the Twelve Apostles have revela-  tion? Do this people have revelation?  We live in too important a day and gen-  eration, and in the midst of too impor-  tant events, for any man to be qualified  to lead the people of God one hour with-  out revelation and inspiration from Al-  mighty God. And at this point I want  to say a few words with regard to this  principle of revelation. Read the history  of the world. Old father Adam, three  years and a half previous to his death,  called together seven of his sons, all  High Priests—Seth, Enos, Jared, Ma-  hallaleel, Canaan, Enoch and Methu-  saleh—with the residue of his posterity,  and there he stood on his feet for a long  time, clothed with the Holy Ghost and  the power of God, and he prophesied  unto his sons what should take place  concerning them and their posterity  to the end of time. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Follow this out;  take all those early patriarchs and  prophets, and later ones, too, and they all  have had revelation. They had to have  it. Whenever a city became ripened in  iniquity, and men blasphemed God and  broke His commandments, the Lord  Almighty raised up prophets and in-  spired men to warn that city and the  inhabitants thereof of the judgments of  God which should come upon them un-  less they repented. Jeremiah was  called to warn Jerusalem and Judea in  the reign of King Zedekiah, and in doing  so he stirred up the anger of the people  against him, and he was cast into a dun-  geon and abused in almost every way,  because he told them what was coming  to pass unless they repented. He did  not praise them; but he told them that  they were committing sin and breaking  the laws of God, and if they did not re-  pent, the judgments of God would over-  take them. [##Jeremiah 37-38##] In reading of how they  persecuted him and what he passed  through, a man would almost expect to  read in the book of Jeremiah that he  said to them, "You may all go to hell  for what I care, I am not going to endure  these things." But you cannot read it  there; for the Lord in calling him had  said unto Jeremiah:    "Before I formed thee in the belly I  knew thee, and before thou camest  forth out of the womb I sanctified thee,  and I ordained thee a prophet unto the  nations." [##Jeremiah 1:5-7##]    Jeremiah gave forth the word of the  Lord, and not one word fell unfulfilled.  And so with every other prophet.    Take the whole history of the world  down to the present generation, and has  there ever been a time when the people  of God did not need revelation? I say,  nay. Now, I would ask this congrega-  tion; I would ask the Jews, the Catho-  lics, the Protestants, I would ask the  clergy of all nations: Can this mighty  dispensation, of which every prophet  has spoken, be fulfilled, and can these  great events transpire in the earth, with-  out revelation from God? No, most as-  suredly not. God never gave to a man  a greater dispensation than the one in  which Joseph Smith was called and or-  dained of God to organize the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It  required revelation. It will require it to  the winding-up scene. Zion cannot be  built up without it, prophets and apostles  cannot do their work without it, nor can  the nations of the earth be warned of the  great judgments that are at the door  without it. Therefore, we say to all  men, Joseph Smith was called of God  by revelation. And further, we say  that no man ever did or ever will have  power to warn the world, to preach the  Gospel, or administer in one of the or-  dinances of the house of God without  the Holy Priesthood. It is just as nec-  essary in the last days as it was in the  days of Christ and His Apostles, or in  the days of Isaiah and Jeremiah. You  cannot separate these things; they be-  long to the same God, to the same sal-  vation, to the same principles of eternal  life.    I have sat and listened to every Apos-  tle that is before me now bear record  during this conference. Did not these  Apostles speak by the Holy Ghost and  the power of God? They did, and their  testimony is recorded in the great library  of the celestial kingdom of God. They  could not edify us without it. I would  to God that the inhabitants of the earth  would get rid of the idea that revelation  ceased when Christ was put to death.  It is a false doctrine. Revelation be-  longs to the salvation of the children of  men.    Again, why did the Lord choose such  a weak man as Wilford Woodruff to pre-  side over His Church? Why did He  choose Joseph Smith—an illiterate boy, as  he was called? Why has He chosen  that class of men? Because He could  handle them. He has chosen men that  will acknowledge the hand of God. The  question has been asked me many times,  Why did not the Lord choose some of  the great divines of the day? Because  it is not His manner of doing business;  it never has been. You may take the  apostles and prophets in any age of the  world, and they have been very humble  men. They are in this day and genera-  tion, or the Lord could not handle them.  That is the reason the Lord has chosen  the weak things of the world to confound  the wise, "and things which are not, to  bring to nought things that are." [##1 Corinthians 1:27-28##] Could  Joseph Smith rise up and boast before  the God of Israel that that was his  work? Could Brigham Young? Could  John Taylor? Can Wilford Woodruff? 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA.    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U.T. Nov 20th 1896.    President Woodruff    Dear Brother:    I have had a desire for a long time  to lay a matter before you which  I consider of Great Importance,  and in asmuch as this life is short,  and especially so, with us that are  advanced in age. I now being in my  eighty third year.    The matter which  I wish to present to you you will  find in the Book of D. & C. I dis  remember the Page, where it speakes  of the Lord sending one mighty and  strong &c, and, near the close of this  Revelation it Refers to the man that  should put forth his hand to Steady  the Ark of God! Should be smitten   (over) 
 REMARKS    Made at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   Sunday afternoon, February   13th, 1898 by    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]    There is a saying that "whatever   leads to good and to do good, is of God;  whatever leads to evil and to do evil,   is of that wicked one." The first re-  mark I wish to make is in relation to   the mystery in my mind concerning  events that have transpired since the  world was made and God created man.  We all belong to Him. We do not belong   to the devil. He never made us. He  never made the world. He does not own  it. But he is here on earth. The mys-  tery to me is why the God of heaven  is so much more unpopular than the  devil on the face of the earth; why   the inhabitants of the earth, who are   the children of God, feel so much more   prone to do that that is evil than to  follow the commandments of God. The   Son of God, when He came to the earth   in the meridian of time, died to save   the world. [##Matthew 27##] The devil did not do it. Still  Jesus Christ was the most unpopular  man that tabernacled in the flesh in His  day and generation. He had more ene-  mies than almost any other being that   ever lived. The nation in which He   dwelt warred against Him, and after a   little while they put Him to death.   Why do men feel that the devil is of   so much more consequence than Christ,   and show themselves more ready to   do evil than good? There is no being   that has power to save the souls of men   and give them eternal life, except the   Lord Jesus Christ, under the command   of His Father. Take the whole history   of the world, from Father Adam down   to this day, and the commandments of   God and those ordinances that will   save men have always been very un-  popular. How was it in the days of   Jesus? Jesus spent about three   years and a half after He   entered the ministry, and then   He was put to death. They warred   against Him and His principles; and  not only against Him but also   against His followers. His Apostles   were all put to death, excepting one,   and he would have been destroyed if  the people could have killed him; but  John the Revelator was preserved by   the power of God, while the others were  slain. Why were they killed? They   were unpopular. The world did not re-  ceive their doctrines. Read the history   of the world in the days of Adam, Seth,  Enos, Jared, Mahalaleel, Canaan, Me-  thusaleh, Noah, when men lived al-  most a thousand years, and you will   find that even in those early times the   children of men turned against God.  They sought that that was evil, and   pursued a course wherein the Lord was   angry with them, and He swept them   off the face of the earth with a flood.  Noah and his family were saved, and   the only ones that were saved. [##Genesis 6##] Do you   ever meditate upon this strange pre-  sentation to our minds in the history   of the dealings of God with men? It   does not matter what age of the world   you look at, whenever the Lord has   raised up Prophets and Apostles, Pas-  tors and Teachers, and commanded   them to do a work, they have been un-  popular and their work has been un-  popular. Take Jeremiah, for instance.    When the Lord sent him forth to teach   and warn the people he was very un-  popular. They put him in the stocks;   they cast him into a pit: they persecut-  ed him continually, until it seems to   me he must have felt like saying, "You   may all go to hell, for aught I care; I   am not going to bother my soul about   you any longer." [##Jeremiah 20:1-2##] But he could not do   that. The Lord had said to him in   sending him forth:    "Before I formed thee in the belly I   knew thee; and before thou camest   forth out of the womb I sanctified thee,   and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the   nations." [##Jeremiah 1:5##]    He commanded Jeremiah to go and   do as He commanded. What was the  consequence? Jeremiah was persecut-  ed, and when he complained of the con-  dition of things, the Lord told him to   go unto Zedekiah, the king of Jerusa-  lem, who had persecuted him,   and say unto him that the judg-  ments of God would come upon him,   his eyes would be put out, he would be   carried captive to Babylon, and he   would die in captivity. [##Jeremiah 34:1-5##]    I need not dwell upon these things:   but they are worthy the contemplation  of the Latter-day Saints. It has seemed   such hard work to do right, and so easy   to do evil. Temptation to do evil is on   every hand, from the day of our birth   until we go to the grave.    How is it in our day? These Latter-  day Saints know our position. The  God of heaven sent an angel to Joseph  Smith. That angel taught him many  things, and told him what to do.  Among other things, he told him there   was a record of the ancient inhabitants   of this land hid up in the hill Cumorah   and commanded him, in due time, to  go forth and receive that record and   translate it into the English language.   We have that record before us, and it   is true. It has come forth in fulfill-  ment of revelation.  John the Revela-  tor said:    "And I saw another angel fly in the   midst of heaven, having the everlasting   Gospel to preach unto them that dwell   on the earth, and to every nation, and   kindred, and tongue, and people.    "Saying with a loud voice. Fear God,   and give glory to Him: for the hour of   His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##]    That angel appeared to Joseph Smith   in his youth. The Lord also gave unto  him many revelations. He received the   Holy Priesthood from under the hands   of heavenly messengers who held the  keys of the Priesthood. He received   the Aaronic Priesthood and the Mel-  chisedek Priesthood, by the administra-  tion of angels from God out of heaven. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##]   He organized the Church of Crist. That  man lived fourteen years after he en-  tered into the ministry. He brought   forth the Book of Mormon and the   Doctrine and Covenants; he organized   the Church, and then he, like the Apos-  tles of old, was slain for the word of   God and testimony of Jesus.    What has been the history of the   Latter-day Saints, even on this great  American continent, and under one of   the most liberal governments God ever  gave to man? Joseph was tormented   and persecuted. His followers were  persecuted. They were driven from the   lands they occupied, and scarcely had   a place to plant their feet. Tribulation   followed them, until they were com-  pelled to come to these valleys of the   mountains. We have had a hard time  to live in a free country like America   and under our great and glorious gov-  ernment. Why this persecution, why   this oppression and this opposition?   Why this warring of the world against   the Gospel of Jesus Christ? There is  but one Gospel; there never was but   one, and never will be but one Gospel.   That Gospel God has revealed to us.   It is the Gospel of faith in the Lord  Jesus Christ, repentance of sin, bap-  tism for the remission of sins, the re-  ception of the Holy Ghost by the lay-  ing on of hands, and the gifts and grac-  es following those who embrace those  principles. You are my witnesses of  the truth of these things. We have   found it to be an uphill work to get the  rights of American citizens. God has   established us here in these valleys of  the mountains. We came here as pio-  neers. We found a barren desert, with   no mark of the white man anywhere.  You see what there is today. It is in  fulfillment of the revelations of God.    Why is this spirit in men to persecute   one another, to fight against God and   His people, as has been the case from   the creation of the world down to our   day more or less? It is wrong, and ev-  ery man that takes a course of this  kind will have to bear the burden of it.   There is but one power in heaven or  on earth that can give man a part in   the first resurrection, clothed with  glory, immortality and eternal life, and   that power comes from God, and not  from the evil one. We ought to look   at these things as they are.    I have a few remarks I want   to make on a certain subject con-  nected with this. We have, as you all  know, lately put forth before the   public a document concerning a cer-  tain man who has been associated with   us—that is, Colonel Isaac Trumbo. It   has been a marvel to a great many   why the Presidency of the Church put   that forth and published it to the world.   It is because what we wrote there,   brethren and sisters, is true. Whether   he is unpopular or not, it makes no   difference to us. We have had so few   men who have not been in this Church   that have stepped forth and done what   he and some others have done, we have   felt it our duty to acknowledge it. I   want to say to you, one and all, that  I do not want to have Colonel Trumbo  go before God, whether before or after   the resurrection, or any other time,   and say that Wilford Woodruff, the   President of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints, deprived him of   the honor that he should have had for   trying to assist the people in their   calamities and in obtaining a State   government for Utah, etc., as we have   rehearsed in that paper. I am willing   to acknowledge Colonel Trumbo, or any   other man, who has gone forth as he  has for years and assisted us in the   days of our trial. He is responsible for   his own acts. We have had some   friends in the midst of our difficulties.   It has been uphill work with us all  the way through in these valleys of the   mountains, but we have managed to  pull through, by the blessings of God   and the labors of a few friends with  our own. Colonel Trumbo was one of   those friends. He took hold and labored  with us, and I feel it is my duty to   acknowledge him before my brethren.   I do it for that reason. I would do   it for any other man that labored with   us. We have had a great many that   labored against us and for our destruc-  tion. We have had to bear these things   from the organization of this Church.   I was associated with Joseph Smith   from 1833 to the time of his death. After   his death I was associated with Brig-  ham Young. I brought him into   this valley in my carriage. I traveled   with him and labored with him   up to the day of his death. So with   John Taylor, and so with the   Apostles and this people. I know, as   God lives, that this is the work of God.   I know the Gospel has been revealed to   us, and we have it. It is our duty to   abide by it. Inasmuch as we will do   this the blessings of heaven will attend  us, and we will have power to build up  Zion in fulfillment of the promises of   God. I am a firm believer myself in   rewards and punishments, and in the   gifts and graces of the Gospel. I have   from my childhood been a firm believer  in the Patriarchs, the Prophets, and   the teachings of Jesus Christ. What   He and His Apostles taught was true.   They were put to death for those   truths, and so have our leaders been   put to death for those truths. Some of   us have been preserved in the earth.   The Latter-day Saints are gathering   together to fulfill these revelations that  have been given to us. Let any man   read the revelations in the Bible; read  the ##Isaiah 49:13-16|49th chapter## of Isaiah:    "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O   earth: and break forth into singing, O   mountains: for the Lord has comforted 
 our hearts should be filled this morn-  ing with gratitude and thanksgiving,  that we have the privilege again of  meeting in an Annual Conference of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. I hope and trust that  the hearts of the Saints will be lifted  up in prayer to God, that during the  time we shall spend together in this  capacity, the spirit and power of  God may rest upon the Apostles and  Elders who will address us, and upon  the Saints themselves who may hear.    I feel very thankful myself that I  still have the privilege of meeting in  general Conference with the Saints  of God. I realize that we are weak  instruments in the hands of God who  are called to perform this work. The  Lord has chosen the weak things of  the world from the foundation of the  earth, to perform His work in every  age and generation of men. I pray  that the Apostles and Elders of Israel  may be clothed upon with the Spirit  and power of God while they address  the Latter-day Saints. We want to  bear in mind that our strength, our  hope and our power is in the hands  of God, and not in men. The Lord  Himself has stretched forth His hand  to establish this Church, His king-  dom, His work, His Zion, the gather-  ing together of His people in fulfill-  ment of the revelations of God which  have been given to the inhabitants of  the earth since the foundation of the  world--since the day of the old Patri-  arch, Father Adam, was brought  forth, and placed in the Garden of  Eden. [##Genesis 2:15##] From that day until now His  work has been performed by the in-  spiration of Almighty God, and not  by the power of man. The very things  in our history that we have been called  to pass through; the scenes which  have been enacted and shown and  they show to-day to all heaven and  earth, in the warfare, in the opposi-  tion, in the labor that are manifested  among the sons of men--from the  creation of the world till to-day--  that this is the work of God. The  various persecutions, the efforts which  have been manifested against the orga-  nization of this Church and kingdom  for its overthrow and destruction,  should show--and have shown to hea-  ven and earth--that there is a power    on earth outside the power of man.    We have no power in ourselves.  We never have had in the guidance  and direction of this kingdom, only  through the interposition of Almighty  God. I have never read anywhere,  that I know of, of the same power  manifested in any dispensation to  the children of men, which was mani-  fested to the Prophet of God in the  organization of this Church, when  the Father and the Son both appeared  to the Prophet Joseph in answer to  his prayer, and when the Father said,  "This is my Beloved Son; behold  Him; hear ye Him." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] This was an  important revelation, which has never  been manifested in the same manner  in any dispensation of the world, that  God has given concerning His work.  So in its organization, the Prophet of  God was administered to by the  angels of heaven. They were his  teachers, they were his instructors,  and all that he did, and all that he  performed from the commencement,  from that day to the day of his mar-  tyrdom, was by the revelation of  Jesus Christ. We ought to under-  stand this, and, as a people, have  faith in God, in His revelations, in  His promises. We should look forth  for the fulfilment of these pro-  mises unto us in the day and genera-  tion in which we live. They will be  fulfilled. The Lord is at work. He  has set His hand to accomplish the  great dispensation of which all the  patriarchs and prophets have spoken  since the world began. Therefore let  not your hearts be troubled; believe  in God, believe in Jesus Christ, be-  lieve in the Gospel which has been  preached unto us, and keep and ful-  fill the commandments of God; then  all will be right. The Lord will not  fail the Latter-day Saints; He will  not fail in His work, in the gathering  of His people; He will not fail the  seed of Abraham; He will not fail the  seed of Judah. They will be gathered  home to Jerusalem, their holy place.  They will receive their city and Tem-  ple, and be prepared for the coming  of their King.    Zion will arise and prosper. If  the Latter-day Saints will but do their  duty, there is nothing in the way of  our accomplishing all that has been 
 till about two days before his death.  Well, we mourn his loss. We feel his  loss. All those associated with him  do. We feel the loss of men occupy-  ing such positions as he has done.  His position has been very responsible.  He has magnified it unto the end.  Now, when Brother Wells' spirit left  his body, what was his condition?  Well, I have my faith and my views  with regard to it. When his spirit  left his body he met with a corps of  friends ready to receive him--those  friends with whom he has dwelt, with  whom he has toiled in building up the  Church and Kingdom of God on the  earth. There is rejoicing when the  spirit of a Saint of the Living God  enters into the spirit world and meets  with the Saints who have gone before  him.    Brethren and sisters, we are not here  in the flesh upon uncertainty. We  are here upon a mission. We have  been kept in the spirit world until the  day and generation in which we live,  and we have been called forth to taber-  nacle here in the flesh. We have heard  the Gospel. We have believed it. We  have received it. We have received  the ordinances thereof. We have a  testimony before high heaven of the  truths of these eternal principles. All  the unbelief of wicked men or devils on  the face of the earth cannot take these  things from our hearts. We know  they are true by the revelations of God  and by the inspiration of the Almighty,  through the Holy Ghost, the Com-  forter. Therefore, we have a great  deal to encourage us and to comfort us.  Of course, the family of Brother Wells  --his wives, his sons and his daughters,  his relatives--all feel his loss. But  when we contemplate and look forward  to the future, and realize the day is not  far distant when Jesus Christ himself  will come in the clouds of heaven to  reward every man according to the  deeds done in the body, then will come  forth the resurrection of the just, and  this man whose tabernacle is here  today will come forth out of his grave,  his body will become immortal, and he  will stand in the midst of the  Gods--in the midst of God the Father,  God the Son, and all the righteous and  holy beings who have kept the same  law, no matter what age of the world  they may have lived in. Then will  come forth the reward that the veil  hides from your faces and mine today--  the reward of those men and women  who have entered into covenant with  the Lord, and who have received the  Gospel of Jesus Christ.    Brother Wells is happy. He would  not come back here if he had the  privilege. He has lived to a good old  age, and has gone down into the grave  like a shock of corn fully ripe, and  with the harness upon him. He and  President Young were about the same  age at death. Well, we feel many  times as we did in the days of Joseph.  The Church felt then as though they  could not live without him. But these  things are in the hand of God.    I would say to the family and to the  friends of Brother Wells, let your  hearts be comforted. All is right.  Brother Wells has as much power to  work and labor for your interest  6the other side of the veil as he has  been able to do here. He has performed  a work here for the living and for the  dead. He has gone to the other side of  the veil to receive his reward. So I  say to the Latter-day Saints, let us be  true and faithful to God and our cov-  enants. We are here upon a mission.  Some are taken; some are left. I have  never seen a year that I know of in  this Church when there have been as  many aged men called away, many of  them suddenly, as in the year that has  passed and gone. Of course it only re-  mains for those of us who are left to  try to do our duty the remaining days  that we have to spend here. But I  want to say to all the Latter-day  Saints, have no fears with regard to  the Kingdom of God, nor the Church  of Christ, nor the work of God. It is  true. Zion is true. The dispensation  is true. The Holy Priesthood is true.  Therefore, let us be true in our labors,  and labor while the day lasts; keep the  commandments of God, and prepare our-  selves for that which is to come. Our  brethren are busy on the other side of  the veil, and they have a work to do to  prepare themselves for the coming of  the Son of Man. All men who go into the  spirit world, and who bear the Holy  Priesthood, will continue their labors.  Their works will follow them. Their  work will not cease when they lay  their tabernacles down here in the  tomb. Their spirits in the spirit world  mingle with those whom it is their  right and privilege to mingle with, and  the work will continue. Therefore, I  say to the family and to the Latter-day  Saints, God bless you all. Let us be  true. Let us be faithful. Let us keep  the commandments of God. Let us  labor while the day lasts, for soon night  may come when no man can work.    My brethren that follow me will oc-  cupy the time to enter into these things  more fully with regard to Brother  Wells, as they shall be led by the Holy  Spirit. I felt I could not do justice to  my feelings without making a few re-  marks upon this occasion; but I do not  feel to spend a great deal of time in  talking to the Latter-day Saints. I ask  God my Heavenly Father to bless you  --to bless the family, bless the Elders  of Israel, bless the Apostles, and all the  quorums and Saints. As I said before,  let us be true to our covenants, true to  God and true to the work we  are engaged in; for we ourselves  will soon be called home, to fol-  low in the same path; our bodies will  be laid in the tomb, as Brother Wells  is going to be today, and we will get  through with our mission unto which  we have been sent here. I thank God  for the Gospel. I thank God for the  light of heaven, and for the truths of  eternal life which have been revealed  from heaven for the exaltation, glory  and salvation of the children of men.  I pray God, my Heavenly Father, that  His blessings may attend us, that we  may be sustained until we get through  with our labor in the flesh, that we  may inherit eternal life; for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 this valley in 1847, they found it a bar-  ren desert, without a single mark of  the Anglo Saxon race. The Latter-  day Saints upon their arrival here set  to work and did the best they could to  change its condition. They plowed,  planted and watered the ground, built  cabins and other habitations, and so  went on until that Tabernacle, the  Temple adjoining it, and three other  temples were reared in the midst of  the people. It had taken millions of  dollars to rear these holy places, and,  he asked, who had to do it? Why the  leaders and Elders in Israel--the Lat-  ter-day Saints, the Relief Societies  and the women of Zion; all had con-  tributed of their substance which God  had given them. Did they call upon  their enemies -- those who were  opposed to them and seeking their  destruction to help them in their  work? No, and they would not have  responded if they had. Was it wrong for  the Latter-day Saints to engage in  these things? It was not; they could  not carry out the purposes of Almighty  God unless they did.    He would say before the Lord that  he believed in his heart there was not  one among the Presidency of this  Church, or among the twelve Apostles,  but who, if required to do so, would lay  down his life willingly for the Gospel's  sake. Moreover, there were thousands  among this people who would be ready  to do the same. Of course, we should  not set our hearts upon the things of  this world, nor suffer them to turn us  from our duties.    With regard to their position  temporally, their history was  before the whole world. The United  States government required their  property--what was called Church  property--and receivers were appointed  to take it. They delivered it up to  them, according to their demands, and  property that had already been sold  and the proceeds of the sales used for  the benefit of the people had been in-  cluded in the seizure.    He thought there was no particular  harm in his naming this. Presi-  dent Taylor delivered into the  hands of the various Bishops  throughout this territory a cer-  tain quantity of wheat and other  grain as trustee-in-trust. It amounted  to considerable; but all this with the  other property was required at their  hands. The authorities went to work  and had to give their notes to the  amount of about $300,000 in order to  satisfy the government. They still  trusted in God; but it took some money  to discharge the demands made upon  them. They had to borrow some  money to meet those notes; and still  they owed something with regard to  them.    President Woodruff alluded to the  many thousands of dollars which it  had also been necessary for the  Church to expend in order to help the  people in some of the settlements, in  the erection of school houses, meeting  houses, to supply the wants of the  poor, etc.    What was the cause of this great  gathering of the people? he asked.  They heard the Gospel of Christ pro-  claimed by His Servants, and believed  it. They came to Zion without coun-  sel from anybody, because they had  the spirit of gathering within them,  and it was this that had made Utah  what she was today.    Let them be patient, faithful to their  covenants with God, full of charity  one towards another, and all would be  well. He counseled them to go for-  ward in the good work which they had  begun, and they would assuredly con-  quer and overcome the obstacles which  beset their path. God would be  pleased and soften the hearts of men  towards them; hundreds and thousands  would yet visit Utah, to behold the  work of the Latter-day Saints, and see  they were in earnest and meant what  they said. 
 Can any of these Apostles? Taken as  we have been from the plow, the plane,  the hammer, and the various occupations  of life, can we boast we have power to  do this? We cannot; we are not made  of that material. The only marvel I  have had all my life has been that the  Lord ever chose me for anything, es-  pecially as an Apostle and as President.  But that is His own business; it was not  mine.    My name has been referred to two or  three times by the Apostles with regard  to my labors. I want to say something  in relation to that. To begin with, I  will say that the Lord has never set His  hand in any age of the world, especially  in ours, to establish a Zion like this,  without preparing an element for it. In  fact, the Lord never undertook to do  anything with regard to this world, ap-  pertaining to His kingdom and work,  until He had prepared a people for it.  Now, the set time had come for the ful-  fillment of the revelations of St. John,  when another angel should fly through  the midst of heaven, having the ever-  lasting Gospel to preach to them that  dwelt upon the earth, "saying with a  loud voice, fear God, and give glory to  Him; for the hour of His judgment is  come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] The time, I say, had come for  the manifestation of the Gospel of Christ  to the world. The Apostles of Christ  and every man that bore the Priesthood  in their day and generation were put to  death for the word of God and testimony  of Jesus, and the Holy Priesthood was  caught up to God, and remained there  until the day and generation in which  Joseph Smith was raised up. He was  ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood by  John the Baptist, who held the keys of  that Priesthood while dwelling in the  flesh. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] He was ordained to the Apostle-  ship by Peter, James and John, who  held the keys of that Priesthood when  they were taken from the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] That  was the beginning of this work. The  Lord could not undertake a work of  this kind without there was a way and a  people prepared for it. In the first  place, the Lord prepared the minds of  men of the generation in which Joseph  Smith was born, that they might be  ready to receive His work when it was  established. There were men that were  kept in the spirit world thousands of  years to stand in the flesh in this genera-  tion to bear this Holy Priesthood and to  bear record of that to the inhabitants of  the earth. Those men have been born  in this day, and they have been moved  upon to prepare for this work.    Now, I desire to say something about  myself. It is generally considered egot-  ism for a man to speak of himself; but I  speak of my history and experience be-  cause it is applicable to thousands of  others. Eighty years ago, when I was  about eight years old, I attended Sab-  bath school under Dr. Porter, a great  reverend divine in Farmington, Con-  necticut. There I read some strange  things in the New Testament. What  were they? Why, I read of Apostles; I  read of men who laid hands on the sick,  and they recovered; who cast out devils,  raised the dead, caused the dumb to  speak, the blind to see, the lame to leap,  who held converse with God and with  holy angels, and had visions and reve-  lations. Brethren and sisters, I read of  these things when I was eight years of  age. They made an impression upon  my mind as soon as I read them. "Why  is it, Dr. Porter,—why is it, Dr. Haws,—  why is it, gentlemen, that you do not  advocate in your day and generation  that faith once delivered to the Saints?  Why don't you receive these things, if  they were the servants of God and had  the Gospel?" "Oh!" said they, "these  things are all done away with. They  were given in the dark ages of the  world to convince the world that Jesus  was the Christ. We live in the blaze of  the glorious gospel light of Christ; we  do not need them today." "Then,"  said I, "give me the dark ages of the  world, if they will give a man power to  unlock the door of eternity and hold  converse with God, and receive these  blessings and gifts manifest in that day."  From that time my inspiration began.  As soon as I grew a little older I began  to read the revelations. My soul was  drawn out upon these things. In my  early manhood I prayed day and night  that I might live to see a prophet. I  would have gone a thousand miles to  have seen a prophet, or a man that could  teach me the things that I read of in  the Bible. I could not join any church,  because I could not find any church at  that time that advocated these principles.  I spent many a midnight hour, by the  river side, in the mountains, and in my  mill (being a miller,) calling upon God  that I might live to see a prophet or  some man that would teach me of the  things of the kingdom of God as I read  them. I remained in that condition un-  til the year 1833. I was living with my  brother on the shores of Lake Ontario.  A man by the name of Zera Pulsipher,  sixty miles from where I lived, was  moved upon in the month of December,  with the snow three or four feet deep, to  arise and go to the north, the Lord had  some work for him there. He called  upon another man to go with him. They  traveled two days on the road to the  north, not knowing where they were  going. Our house was the first place  that they stopped at. I was lumbering  at the time on the shore of the lake.  Zera Pulsipher told my brother's wife  who they were and what they were, and  what their principles were. He said the  Lord had sent him into the north coun-  try to do some work there. My sister-  in-law told him that her husband and  myself both believed in the principles  that he taught. Well they held a meet-  ing. I went to it, and for the first time  in my life I heard a Gospel sermon. I  invited the men home. I borrowed a  Book of Mormon, and sat up all night  and read it, and I had a testimony it was  true. In the morning I asked to be  baptized. Myself and brother were  baptized—the first in that region of coun-  try. From that hour till this I never  have had one moment's doubt with re-  gard to the truth of the Gospel of Jesus  Christ. I know the work is true. I have  been called into the vineyard and minis-  try with the rest of my brethren, and I  have traveled a great many miles and  quite a number of years. I have held  the Apostleship fifty-eight years. Bro-  ther Joseph only held it some fourteen  before he was slain. Brother Brigham  held it about forty, and Brother Taylor  about the same length of time as my-  self. I have labored all these years and  I know it is the work of God. I know  the Lord is with this people. I have a  desire that we may magnify our callings  and fulfill our position upon the earth.  God has organized this Church; He has  organized it with prophets, apostles,  pastors, teacher, helps, etc., in fulfill-  ment of the promises of God in the last  days. I traveled with Joseph Smith  quite a length of time. I traveled with  Brigham Young forty years, at home and  abroad. I traveled with him to this  country. We came with the pioneers.  Brigham Young, though he never wrote  many revelations, had the revelations of  God with him from the day that he em-  braced this work till the day of his  death. I have often thought of the time  when he was asked if he would not go  on to California instead of stopping in  this barren land. What was his ans-  wer? I was with him when he gave  that answer. He said, "No, I am going  to stay right here. I am going to build  a temple here; I am going to build a city  here; I am going to build a country  here." Has it not been so? Yes, it has.  Was it not by revelation? Certainly it  was. We have all been called from this  low position in life to the Priesthood.  Thousands of this people have been  called to go abroad to preach the Gos-  pel. In speaking of myself and the  manner I was led, so we find it every-  where throughout the world. Where  did you come from? You came from  every state in the Union; from England,  Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany,  France, Ireland and other parts of  Europe, as well as from the different  nations of the earth and the islands of  the sea. One of these simple Elders  came to you and you heard him preach  the Gospel, and he promised you if you  would repent of your sins and be bap-  tized for the remission of them, you  should receive the gift of the Holy  Ghost. Did you not receive it? You  did, or you would not be here today.  Nobody could then keep you at home.  We have been gathered together by the  commandments of God, and so far we  are trying to do the will of God. But  we have only just begun. I was at the  concert here last night, and I could not  help but think that if President Young  had been there and looked upon that  vast assembly of ten thousand people,  gathered not only from this territory but  from neighboring states and territories,  he would have felt satisfied. When he  built this Tabernacle we did not have  people to fill it; but he told us that in  the building up of Zion we would never  have a house big enough to accommo-  date us however large we might build  it; and so it proved last night. I enjoyed  the concert. Governor Thomas invited  me to address the assembly; but I felt  that people had gathered there, not to  hear preaching, but music.    Let me speak a little further with re-  gard to the Lord preparing a people for  this work. The history of this whole  people is in that line. I will refer you  to the year 1840. The Lord gave a  commandment for the Twelve Apostles  to go to England. There had a few  gone to England before; Brother Kim-  ball and several others went in 1837 and  established the Church there. But in  1840 the Apostles were called as a body  to go there; and the devil did not like it.  He tried to kill us all. There was  hardly one of the Twelve Apostles who  went that was well. When I left home  President Young paddled me across the  Mississippi in a canoe, and I was suffer-  ing with the chills and fever. I had  spent two years in Tennessee and Ken-  tucky, in the midst of sickness; but I  never had an attack of chills and fever  in my life till I was called to go to Eng-  land. It was so with most all of us. The  devil did not like it; but we went. It  was the harvest time then in that land.  We accomplished a great work. We

I take pleasure in   recommending Bro James  R Hanson, as a faithfull  member of this ward.    respy  your Bro in the Gospel    John H Clarke  Bp 
 his people, and will have mercy upon  his afflicted.    "But Zion said, The Lord hath for-  saken me, and my Lord hath forgotten   me.    "Can a woman forget her sucking  child, that she should not have com-  passion on the son of her womb? yea,   they may forget, yet will I not forget   thee.    "Behold, I have graven thee upon the   palms of my hands; thy walls are con-  tinually before me."    Those things that have been predict-  ed from the beginning concerning the  winding up scene and the second com-  ing of the Son of Man will come to   pass. Therefore, let us prepare for   them.    I bear my testimony of these things;   for I do not know how long I shall have  this privilege on the earth. In my   boyhood I attended the Sabbath   school under old Dr. Porter, one of the   pillars of the Presbyterian church in   New England. I read the New Testa-  ment there; I read of Christ and of  the Apostles; I read of the miracles   and the gifts. I asked Dr. Porter why   they did not have those things in their   midst. "Why do you not have that   faith once delivered to the Saints?   Why do you not have Prophets and   Apostles now?" The doctor smiled and   said, "My boy, those things are done   away." I knew they were done away;   but why were they done away? He   said, "They were given in the dark   ages of the world, to convince the in-  habitants of the earth that Jesus was   the Christ. We live today in the blaze   of the glorious Gospel light of Christ,   and do not need these things." Then,   said I to him and to others, "Give me   the dark ages of the world instead of   this glorious Gospel blaze, if in those   dark ages there was power to unlock   the heavens and give you converse with   God and angels, and give you gifts and   graces and power." Yes, in my boy-  hood I would have gone a thousand  miles to have seen a Prophet. I had a  desire to see one. I hoped to live to   see one. I have lived to mingle with  Prophets and Apostles for a long peri-  od. From 1833 to this day I have never  seen anything but truth in connection   with this work.    Let us try to do our duty and mag-  nify our calling before high heaven;   for it will pay us. When I die I want  the privilege of being raised from the  dead, and of mingling with God, with   Christ, and with Apostles and Proph-  ets, and the privilege of having my   family, my father and mother, my  brothers and sisters, with me in the   celestial kingdom of God, organized in   a family capacity, that we may dwell   together there.  Salvation is worth some-  thing, no matter whether it is popular  or unpopular, despised or not despised;   and if we ever get it, we will get it   by keeping the commandments of God   and carrying out these principles that   God has revealed to us. I have traveled   with the Prophets and Apostles, and   seen the persecutions, and been through   some of the trials and tribulations. We   have been led here, and we will try  to build up Zion here. This Tabernacle  and these temples the old Prophet   Isaiah and other Prophets saw. We  are here in fulfillment of prophecy, and  we are doing all the good we can. Why  should man quarrel with his neighbor  about religion? Every man has a right   to his religion, whether it will save him   or not. I never quarreled with any   man about religion; never con-  sidered it proper to do so. I  never felt like debating with  any man upon the subject of religion   for the sake of gaining power over   him in debate. I do not believe in it.  I teach what good I can, and when I   get through with this world I hope I   will be satisfied with it. We have  gathered here from all nations. I bap-  tized many in England that have gath-  ered here, though most of them have  passed away, where I shall go myself   before long.    I pray God to bless you and to guide   and direct us all, as Apostles, as  Prophets, as Elders, as Saints, as  fathers and mothers, and as children.   Only reflect a moment on the blessing   that God has given you in having the  privilege of going into these temples   and working for our dead friends. We  have four temples, one standing on this   block. Brigham Young directed in the  building of them, and he has gone home   to glory, immortality and eternal life.   I pray God that we may have power  to do our duty, magnify our calling,   walk uprightly before the Lord, and   acknowledge the hand of God in all the  blessings bestowed upon us. This is   my prayer and desire in the name of   Jesus Christ. Amen.

 James N. Stanworth  Sept. 6 [18]96. 
 baptized about seven thousand that year,  opened doors throughout England and  and Scotland, and laid a foundation for  the work which has been fulfilled up to  the present time. I will refer to one  circumstance connected with that mis-  sion. I was in the potteries in Stafford-  shire, having gone there when I got to  England. I was doing a good work  there, baptizing almost every night.  One night I went to Hanley to hold a  meeting, and there was a very full  house. Before I got up to speak, the  Spirit of God came upon me and told  me that that was the last meeting I  should hold with that people for many  days. I had appointments out for two  weeks in that region of the country.  After I got through preaching that night,  I told them it was the last meeting I  should hold with them. I went down  into the water and baptized quite a  number, and in the morning I went be-  fore the Lord and asked what He  wanted of me. He told me to go to  the south. I got into the stage and  rode eighty miles south. I went into  Herefordshire, and the first man's house  I stopped at was John Benbow's. In  one hour after I arrived at his house I  learned why the Lord had sent me there.  I name this because it is in the line of  what I was speaking of. Here I found  a company of men and women, some  six hundred, who had banded together  under the name of United Brethren, and  were laboring for the ancient order of  things. They wanted the Gospel as  taught by the prophets and apostles, as  I did in my youth. Well, without dwell-  ing upon this, I will say that the first  thirty days after I arrived in Hereford-  shire I baptized forty-five preachers and  several hundred members, and I had in  my hands all the chapels or houses  licensed for worship according to law.  We brought in two thousand in about  eight months' labor. Many of these  people had been looking and praying  for this very work, and they were pray-  ing for it when I went there. I took no  honor to myself with regard to this mat-  ter, I never felt that I could. All we  have to do is to follow the dictation of  the Spirit of the Lord, and give God the  honor and the glory of it. We did a  good work there and God blessed us.  From there we went to London.  Brothers Heber C. Kimball and George  A. Smith and myself preached and es-  tablished the first branch of the Church  in the city of London. I rejoiced very  much in my labors in Herefordshire,  Gloucestershiae and Worcestershire,  and thousands of those that were bap-  tized there are in Utah. We had quite  a number of Bishops in this Territory  that I baptized at that time. The  youngest I baptized there was Brother  Rowberry, who was a bishop of Tooele.  He was only a boy at that time.    I want to refer to one circumstance  that took place while in that mission  and I do it as an example of the Lord's  dealings with us in matter pertaining to  temporal matters. John Benbow was a  noble man. He was like an English  lord; as rich a man, I suppose as ever  came into the Church. He had not  been baptized a month, I do not think,  when he came into a little sitting room  with his wife, and he probably spent  three quarters of an hour in telling me  that he had been reading in the New  Testament how in the days of the  Apostles they sold all their possessions  and laid them at the Apostles' feet [##Acts 4:34-35##], and  he said he felt it was his duty to fulfill  that law and he wanted to do it. I  listened to him patiently and when he got  through it took perhaps half an hour  to tell him the difference between our po-  sition today and the position of the  Apostles in that day. I gave him to under-  stand that God had not sent me to Eng  land to take care of his gold, his horses, his  cows and his property; He had sent me  there to preach the Gospel. I told him,  however, that the Lord would accept of  his sacrifice, and that whenever he  could do good, he should do it; he  should assist the poor, help publish the  Book of Mormon, etc. Now, what  would have been the result if I had  taken the other course, and said, "Yes  give me your property and I will take  care of it?" Why, he would probably  have apostatized. Not only that, but  there would have been one foolish  Apostle, who would have been a suitable  candidate for apostasy also. But was  that any temptation to me? No, it was  not. It would not have been to any  Elder who had enough of the Spirit of  God to know the difference between a  hundred thousand pounds of money  and a part in the first resurrection, with  power to pass by the angels and the  gods to exaltation and glory, and stand  in the presence of God and the Lamb  forever and forever.    I name these things to show that there  was a people prepared for this work.  Go where you would and you would find  spirits of this kind. That is why this  people have come up here from the  various nations of the earth. We have  the Gospel of Christ abroad in all  nations today as far as we have oppor-  tunity, and we have got to continue  this work. The Lord is going to cut  His work short in righteousness [##Romans 9:28##]; and as  I have said before, however insignificant  this people may be in the eyes of the  world, the God of heaven holds us re-  sponsible for preaching this Gospel to  every nation under heaven, and we have  it to do or we will be damned. We  cannot avoid this. Why? Because, as  Paul says, "Woe is unto me, if I preach  not the Gospel." [##1 Corinthians 9:16##] There is but one  Gospel; never has been but one, and  never will be; and Paul says, "But  though we, or an angel from heaven  preach any other Gospel unto you than  that which we have preached unto you,  let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] That Gospel, ye  saints of the living God, and the world,  is in our hands, sent to us by the minis-  trations of Angels—the same Gospel that  was taught from Adam to Christ, and  from Christ down to our day and gener-  ation, when God has had a people on  the earth. I have a great desire myself  for the welfare of the Latter-day Saints.  We have a great work to perform.    Before I close, I want to say a few  words to the Apostles and to the  Saints of God. I want to say something  about the devil. The devil, in the days   of the Savior, got one Apostle to deny  his Lord and sell Him for thirty pieces  of silver. But when Judas' eyes were  opened to see what he had done, he  did not prize those thirty pieces of  silver, but went out and hung himself.  Is that devil dead? Has Lucifer, the son  of the morning, gone out of existence?  No; he is here today. He is in the  midst of this people; and if there are any  people under heaven that Lucifer with  all the fallen angels that dwell on the  earth are laboring to destroy, they are  these Latter-day Saints. It was so an-  ciently; it will be so until He who holds  the keys of death and hell shall bind  Satan and shut him up. Until that hour  he will labor for our destruction. I  want to say to these Apostles that I have  seen days of trouble with the quorum of  the Twelve. I have referred many times  to the days in Kirtland, and my heart  has had a great deal of pain over those  affairs. There the devil labored with  the Apostles and caused a good  share of them to apostatize. One half  of them apostatized, and some of the  others came pretty near it. The signers  or witnesses to the Book of Mormon—  Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and  Martin Harris—all apostatized from the  Church of Jesus Christ, though they  never denied the Book of Mormon. In  the darkest day, neither one of them  ever denied that, but always maintained  it to the day of his death. But I want  to say to my brethren that if the devil  could get one of these Apostles—yes,  one of them—to believe that the Presi-  dency of this Church were working  against him, and that we did not have  his welfare at heart, or if he could get a  Seventy or any man in this Church to  believe it, he would labor to do so. If  the devil could have got the Savior to  have followed him, he would have over-  thrown the whole plan of salvation.  But he did not do it. Jesus said, "Get  the behind me, Satan: for it is written,  Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,  and Him only shalt thou serve." [##Luke 4:8##] So I  say to these Apostles before me, if the  devil could make one of you believe that  we would not give you right counsel, he  would do it. But he will not do it. I  thank God for that. I feel I can prophesy  that before God and angels. The Apos-  tles, as a body, are united, and God has  laid His Spirit upon them, and they will  be true and faithful to this work until  they get through with it. Those are my  feelings. I rejoice in this. I trust I  shall never pass through any more of  those scenes that I witnessed in the  days that are past and gone.    Brethren and sisters, God bless you.  Now, do not be afraid that the Presi-  dency and Apostles of this Church will  give you any wrong counsel. We have  learned better than to do that. We  shall never do it while we dwell in the  flesh. The salvation of the sons of men  is of far more worth than all the honor  that the human family can give upon  our heads. Give me salvation; give me  a part in the first resurrection; give me  the privilege of standing in the morning  of the first resurrection with the  resurrected dead—with my father's  house and with the prophets and apos-  tles who have lived in my day and  generation; give me power to be exalted  with them in the eternal worlds in the  kingdom of our God. That is all I ask.  And it is my privilege and yours. It is  the privilege of this people to receive  these blessings at the hands of God. I  have confidence in my brethren. I re-  joice with them in the union that dwells  today in the house of Israel, and with  the Presidency and Twelve Apostles.  We love one another. We understand  something of the work of God in our  day and time. We have labored to-  gether. Here are my counselors; they  have spent years and years upon the  islands of the sea, where they have had  to live upon cocoanuts and poi and food  of that character, and they did it to save  the souls of men. God has blessed them  in all their labors. He will bless them.  He will bless this people.    I believe this is all I want to say to  you this morning. I felt sick when I 
 promised unto us. I have no fears  myself with regard to the outcome  and final triumph of the kingdom of  God, of the Zion of God, of the Church  of God, of the Saints of God. The  Lord has already gathered many thou-  sands to these valleys of the moun-  tains, in fulfillment of His promises.    Now, brethren and sisters, let us  be thoughtful while in the flesh, and  seek to magnify our calling. Let our  hearts be set on the building up of  the kingdom of God, and none shall  fail. With regard to those who may  address us during this Conference, I  hope that they may all have our  prayers, that they may be inspired  by the Spirit of God, and preach only  those things which are true and faith-  ful.    May God bless us and pour out His  Spirit upon us, that we may have a  good time at this Conference. May  we enjoy that Spirit, may our hearts  be united together, and may we re-  joice in those principles which have  been revealed for the comfort, salva-  tion, and eternal life of the children  of men.
