I also believe should you socounsel the sooner he goes the easier it would be to overcome; thathas been my experience.My doctrine has been to have as light a strain on me from home as possible.

The Spirit of God had borne record to the First Presidency, the Twelve and the elders generally that we should be delivered from the hands of our enemies, and the Spirit of the Lord never lied; hence we were en-abled to listen to the voice of our Presi-dent to-day. The leaders of this peo-ple had been constantly inspired byrevelations from God.The speaker prophesied, in the name of Israel's God, that the church would never be without a law given from thattime henceforth and forever.

 THE DESERET NEWS. Oct. 8Priesthood Meeting. — A meeting of the Priesthood was held in the Taber-nacle last evening, commencing at 7o'clock, and a large congregation as-sembled. The speakers were Presi-dent John Taylor and President Wil-ford Woodruff. The former delivered an elaborate and interesting discourseupon the Priesthood, both Aaronicand Melchisedec, the Gospel and theMediation, the designs of God in thecreation of the earth, the fall of Adam and the ultimate redemption of theworld and its inhabitants.President Woodruff, in the course ofhis remarks referred to a circumstancethat took place at Kirtland fifty years ago last April, on the oc-casion of his first seeing and hearing the Prophet Joseph Smith. The latterat a Priesthood meeting called to as-semble in a little log house, after anumber of Elders had testified, aroseand prophesied that this work would yet fill the earth, and that the Latter-day Saints would fill the Rocky Moun-tains, and with the Lamanites wouldbuild up the Zion of God. The speakersaid he little thought then that he would see the Rocky Mountains, muchless live to witness the fulfillment of Joseph's prophecy. He also testifiedto the utter fulfillment of the Prophet's words in the triumph of truth and the overthrow of Babylon.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President Wilford WoodruffRemarked that as a few momentsyet remained before the service of thatafternoon closed, he desired to occupythe remainder of the time. He hadbeen very much afflicted during thelast three or four days--so much so thathe at one time feared he would not beable to speak at this Conference at all.However, he had some things uponhis mind that he would like to say tothe Latter-day Saints before the Con-ference ended, and there were a fewhe might mention that afternoon.Referring to the subjects treated uponby the preceding speaker, PresidentWoodruff said the Lord had laboredfrom the creation of the world to do allthat He could, consistent with theagency of men, to fit them forthe highest glory they werecapable of receiving; and from thedays of Father Adam down to ourday, whenever the Lord had a peopleon the earth who would obey Him, Hehad raised up Prophets and Apostlesand given unto them the Holy Priest-hood and the keys and powers thereof,that they might administer to the sonsand daughters of Adam and preparethem for celestial glory. But underthat law, under the administration ofthose men, the opposition of the worldhad been encountered; and whenevermen undertook to live righteous livesand keep the law of God they had tosuffer persecution.The Lord had promised through themouths of the ancient Patriarchs andApostles, for thousands of yearsthat are past and gone, thatin the latter days He wouldsend the fulness of the everlastingGospel to the children of men; that Hewould raise up Prophets and Apostles;that He would organize His Churchand Kingdom on earth; that He wouldraise up men to go forth for the lasttime and prune his vineyard with amighty pruning, to prepare forthe coming of the Son of Man. Thesons of Israel today who dwelt in thecongregation before him were aclass of those men. God hadcalled them from the nationsof the earth -- Apostles, Prophets,Elders, Seventies and High Priests,and the Lesser Priesthood, to labor inthe vineyard for the last time, togather out the inhabitants of the earthas far as they would listen to the testi-mony borne to them, calling uponthem to prepare for the great work ofGod which was at their doors. TheElders of Israel had traveled tens ofthousands of miles to accomplish this.The conduct of the Latter-daySaints should be very different fromthe rest of the world, who did not pro-fess these things. The Kingdom ofGod was here upon the earth in itsfulness. There were many things be-longing to this Church and Kingdomwhich were not looked for in the world.One of these was union. That was alaw of God belonging to the Latter-day Saints. Like the ancient Prophetsand Apostles, the modern Prophets andApostles should be united in theirwork in the flesh; and we as a peopleshould not deviate from this rule.There should be unity throughout, aunity of heart and mind, from the Pres-ident of the Church and his two coun-

 THE DESERET WEEKLYPIONEER PUBLICATION  ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.ESTABLISHED TRUTH AND LIBERTY. JUNE 1850NO. 17 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH SATURDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1892. VOL. XLV.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid that through the mercy and provi-dence of God those present this morn-ing had been preserved to again at-tend the semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Quite a number of our breth-ren and sisters had passed from thisstate of existence into the spirit world since we last met in Conference. Inturn we should also pass away. Whilewe had the privilege of meeting togeth-er in this capacity, he trusted that ourhearts would be united in prayer beforethe Lord, that we might enjoy the in-spiration of Almighty God, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of light and truth, so that we might edify one an-other in our teachings, counsels, tes-timonies and administrations. Weneeded this blessing day by day, thatwe might understand and comprehend the responsibilities which we wereunder to God our Heavenly Father.When he reflected that this com-paratively little band of men and wo-men had been gathered into the valleys of these mountains, from all nations under heaven, by the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for the purpose of carrying outthe mind and will of God in the ageand dispensation in which we lived,he realized indeed, as all the Saintsmust, that the responsibility restingupon us, as upon the Saints of God inevery age of the world, was very great.Like all other dispensations and gen-erations of men, we were placed hereon a mission. We lived in the spirit world before we came here: we dwelt in the presence of God; and it had been our fortune, or our destiny — call it which you please — to be born in thepresent generation when the God of Israel had set his hand for the last time to build up His kingdom upon theearth, to prepare His people for the great event which awaits us.There had been no dispensation fraught with greater importance than this, and his desire while we were to-gether in this Conference was that theApostles and Elders who might ad-dress us should have the spirit of thePriesthood upon them.He thanked God that he stilllived — that his life had been spared until now. When he looked back upon the past,he real-ized that the majority of his formercompanions — those with whom he hadbeen associated from the foundation of this Church — had gone into the spiritworld; and he expected shortly to fol-low them there.From the time we were first led intothese mountain valleys by a prophet, seer and revelator, who was clothedwith the spirit and power of God, until now, the hand of God had been mani-fested among the people, and that in fulfilment of the revelations and proph-ecies recorded in every book handeddown to us as the word of God to the children of men.He sincerely hoped that while we lived in the flesh we would fully re-alize all our responsibilities and thework which is required at our hands.He desired that the Saints would, as far as possible during this conference, lay aside all business cares, and paystrict attention to the work now beforeus — that we might be of one heart andmind, and be filled with light, truthand power to receive the teachings of our brethren. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid he realized that there were a great many persons in this city wait-ing to go into the Temple in the day and time appointed unto them, and it was therefore deemed inadvisable to continue the present Conference in this building inview of the dedication services. TheLord had been very merciful unto this people, and he felt thoroughly satis-fied that His blessing would bepoured out in abundance upon all thoseupon theresponded to the call made upon them for assistance in finishingthe Temple. He rejoiced in the blessings which the Saints had enjoyed upon the present oc-casion in listening to the

 REMARKSMade at the General Conference of theChuch, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday morning, October 7th, 1894, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.[REORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]I feel as though I want to say a fewwords to the Latter-day Saints, althoughI am in very poor condition physicallyto talk to the public. This has been oneof the most interesting conferences Ihave ever attended; and if I am allowedto be proud of anything, I certainlyhave felt proud and have rejoiced atthe spirit that has been manifested bythe Apostles in their teachings. Oneof the subjects that they have dweltupon I desire to speak of, and that iswith regard to the Word of Wisdom.The brethren have dwelt very stronglyupon this subject, and it is right thatthey should. The word of Wisdomapplies to Wilford Woodruff, the Presi-dent of the Church, and it applies toall the leaders of Israel, as well as tothe members of the Church; and ifthere are any of these leading men whocannot refrain from using tobacco orliquor in violation of the Word of Wis-dom, let them resign, and let otherstake their places. As leaders of Israel,we have no business to indulge in thesethings.  There may be things contraryto the Word of Wisdom that we in-dulge in-, and that we think we cannotlive without; if we cannot, let us die.President George Q. Cannon has beenlaying before us the truth with re-gard to the position which we occupyhere. This is the work of God, and westand as an example to the world.Therefore, all of us, from head to foot,should make up our minds to keep thecommandments of God. If I do notvalue my standing, my salvation, mycrown of glory and eternal life morethan I value those things which arerepresented as being unwise for us touse, then I am not fit to occupy my posi-tion. And this applies to every man inIsrael. We all ought to take a coursewhereby we might be justified beforethe Lord. We live in the last dispensa-tion and fulness of times, and we areplaced here to guide and direct theaffairs of the Church of God on theearth. Hence we ought to be wise men;we ought to be righteous men, holymen, temperate men; we ought to bemen that will stand in a position to re-ceive the Spirit of God to guide anddirect us. If we do not stand in thisposition, we are not fit to perform thiswork.Brethren and sisters, give heed to theteachings that we have received duringthis conference. As a people, we are ad-vancing, and not standing still. Wesend Elders abroad, and they report tous every little while what they aredoing; but there is a class of Elders atwork every week that do not report tous. You see their works, though youmay not comprehend them. As theSavior said, "Ye may discern the faceof the sky; but can ye not discern thesigns of the times?" The Latter-daySaints should observe the signs of thetimes. The Lord is fulfiling every-thing that He has said. There isnothing given in these records of divinetruth but will have its fulfillment. Mes-sengers have gone forth in the worldto make the commencement and tocarry out these great events that arespoken of in the revelations of God. Ithink it is time we should improve andadvance. The Lord is going to cut Hiswork short in righteousness, or no fleshwill be saved. The Lord is at work forZion, and He has made no mistake incalling the Latter-day Saints to theseRocky Mountains--the everlasting hillswhich old father Jacob gave to Josephin blessing him. We are here andlaboring to promote the interest andwelfare of the Church of God. I feelto rejoice at the manifestation of theSpirit of God during this conference.Many of us have been in this Church agood while and are advanced in years.I hope that what time we remain herewe may spend to good advantage. Letus try to do our duty in all matters ap-pertaining to the work of God. I amthankful for the blessings we enjoy to-day. Zion is growing. The earth isadvancing. The judgments of God areapproaching. The Lord says:After your testimony cometh the testimony ofearthquakes, that shall cause groanings in themidst of her, and men shall fall upon theground, and shall not be able to stand.And also cometh the testimony of the voiceof thunderings, and the voice of lightnings,andthe voice of tempests, and the voice of thewaves of the sea, heaving themselves beyondtheir bounds.And all things shall be in commotion; andsurely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fearshall come upon all people.The revelations of God have got tobe fulfilled. When? Some time beforethe coming of the Son of Man--andthat is not far off. Therefore, let us tryto live our religion, and set an examplebefore one another and the world. Iaccept the reproof of any Apostle orElder if there is any requirement of theLord that I am not fulfilling. That isthe way I feel, and I think we all shouldfeel so. We are greatly blessed in hav-ing received the Gospel of Christ, inhaving received the Priesthood and thepower to go forth and warn the nations,that they may be left without excuse inthe day of God's judgment. And thehonest and meek of the earth have beengathered to the mountains of Israel,that they may stand here in holy placeswhile the judgments of God overtakethe world. Joseph Smith was raised upby the power of God, and the Priest-hood and Apostleship has been with usfrom that day to this, and will continueuntil Christ comes to reign. Christ haspassed through His trials and afflictions;He has redeemed the world; He hasgone home, and He sits in glory withthe righteous, and will come with them.All the prophets and apostles, those ofour day as well as of other generations,will come with Him. Joseph Smithstood at the head of the greatest dispen-sation God ever gave to man.These things are true. Let us try to doour duty, walk uprightly before theLord, and appreciate the blessings weenjoy. Let our prayers ascend beforethe Lord to assist and guide us in every-thing, that when we get through withour work we may be satisfied. If theeyes of this people were open to com-prehend the truths of eternity, theywould see the importance of laboringwhile the day lasts. Our sons anddaughters, if their eyes were open tocomprehend what lies before them,would also labor with all their might toqualify themselves for it, and our sonswould be prepared to go to the nationsto warn them, that their garments shallbe clean from the blood of all men. Elders are being sent to almost everypart of the earth, and the cloud is be-ginning to lift from off Zion. Theworld is beginning to see us as we are.They open their eyes and marvel atwhat they see here. We are beginningto be understood better than we havebeen, and this will go on until a greatmany in the world will feel that Utah isa good place to live in. Our lakes andrivers will not overflow and drown us;but we will be protected from the earth-quakes, from the cyclones, and from thejudgments that are now overtaking theworld. Very strange things have takenplace during this year, and the judg-ments of God will continue.I pray God that His blessings mayrest upon us; that our eyes may beopened to see, our ears to hear and ourhearts to understand our duty and whatHe requires at our hands, that we maybe justified when we get through. Weare all passing along.  Many of ourmissions will close in a short time, andwe will go as others have done. Then,if not before, we will comprehend theblessings we enjoy. When we get theother side of the veil we will appreciatethis dispensation in which we live. Ido not know whether we do here or not.I think many times we do not. I have

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.selors down. The law of God required it;and whenever there was any deviationfrom this they were in danger. Thework of the people of God was ad-vancing, and in this nation there wasa great change in public feeling takingplace in regard to the Latter-daySaints, than whom no people hadbeen more lied about or misrepresentedin the past, since they came to dwellin the valleys of these mountains. Theworld should learn who and whatthey were, and what they were doing;and all they asked was that the truthshould be spoken concerning them.They had labored in the interest oftheir fellowmen. As Latter-daySaints they had faith that God wouldsave the whole human family in somekind of glory, if they were not the sonsof perdition. But all men underheaven were held responsible be-fore God for their acts, and ifthey committed sin they had to paythe penalty.He prayed God that they might all,as Latter-day Saints, live their religion,do what God required of them, remem-ber their prayers, and walk uprightlybefore the Lord, and when they reachedthe other side of the vail they wouldmeet with their reward, according tothe works done in the flesh. He prayedthat God's blessing would rest upon thisConference, that the people would beunited together, and that much goodwould result therefrom.

 356  THE DESERET NEWS. -[October 10, 1866.The Deseret News.TRUTH AND LIBERTYALBERT CARRINGTON EDITORWednesday Oct. 10, 1866.Elder Wilford Woodruff occupied the stand and spoke by way of testimony in a most interesting manner, referringto the way in which the Lord had work-ed upon him to receive it; and of the manner in which God had worked upon President B. Young and many otherElders, for the same purpose. He also spoke of the efforts of the adversary to destroy those noble spirits who had re-ceived the truth at an early day of the Church, and of evil spirits coming to them in numbers at various times and places with this object; bearing testi-mony of having been so attacked in London, when in company with ElderGeorge A. Smith, and of three angels appearing to him who relieved him from the power and presence of the wicked spirits. This testimony, he said, he had never borne publicly before; andthe spirit which accompanied it de-clared its truth to the immense congre-gation to whom it was for the first time given. During his remarks he related many interesting incidents of the pro-tecting care which the Lord has exer-cised over his servants. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  493PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid he felt to thank God his Heaven-ly Father that he had the privilegethis day of standing in the midst ofsuch a vast congregation in the house of israel. He also thanked the 10,000Latter-day Saints whose prayers hadascended to the Lord in his behalf. Bythe power of God and their prayers he has been preserved until thepresent hour. While he did not feelcapable of answering his own thoughtsin reflecting upon the scene through whichthe Latter-day Saints as apeople had passed in the years whichwere gone, still he assured his hearersthat his heart was full of blessing and thankfullness towards his brethren and sisters, and all men who haddesired to do what was right.This was a day to which he had looked forward for many years, andwhen he reflected upon the hundredsand thousands of Elders of Israel, andthe Prophets and Apostles with whomhe had been associated, many of whomhad already passed to the other side ofthe vail, he marveled at the work whichhad thus far been accomplished and that his own life had been preserved solong in the midst of this people.As Latter-day Saints had great reason for rejoicing before the Lord, and their hearts should be filled withgratitude and thanksgiving unto the Most High for the many blessings vouchsafed unto them.When he took a retrospect of their position and saw what had been ac-complished through God's mercy, by this people, since they arrived in these valleys on the 24th of July, 1847, itwas to him a marvel and a wonder. Though many of their brethren— President Brigham Young, who hadled them here, and others who wereformerly associated with them in thisgreat latter-day work, had passed away—yet he believed that in the spiritworld today they were deeply inter-ested and rejoicing in the work in which the Latter-day Saints were engaged on this special occasion.They were expecting (continuedPresident Woodruff) by the blessing of God to enter, in a few days hence, theTemple which had been reared here in the name of the Lord, by His people;and he desired in the short time nowat his disposal to bless every Latter-daySaint from the bottom of his heart forwhat they had done towards theachievement of this grand object. Nocall, he believed, had ever been madeupon any people upon the face of theearth which had met with such ahearty and universal response as that for the means to finish the Salt Lake Tem-ple. He felt to thank the Lord for thespirit which had been manifested bythe Saints in this respect.They had erected three temples be-fore this one in these mountain valleys. The Elders of Israel had labored un-ceasingly to attend to the ordinances ofthe house of God, both for the livingand the dead; because he need hardlytell the Latter-day Saints that theseholy temples had been erected for theredemption of the dead as well asblessing the living.The Prophet Joseph Smith laid thefoundation of this Church and King-dom and revealed those principlesunto us; but no principle had ever beenreve[a]led from God to man which hadgiven the Latter-day Saints more joyand consolation than the revelationswhereby the Lord had fulfilled the prophecy of one of the ancientprophets, who said that in the last days He would raise up saviors uponMount Zion, while the Kingdom wasthe Lord's. That day had come.He himself well remembered the time when that revelation was given—the feeling which thrilled theirhearts and souls when they realizedthat in their day and generation theyhad the power to go forth and attend to these ordinances for their dead progenitors, the same as for those whowere still living in the flesh. They did not hesitate, as soon as that revela-tion came, to make a commencementof this Temple work, and therewere scores of men around himtoday who had labored for yearsin these temples in this way. Hegreatly rejoiced at the thought thatwhen he himself entered the spirit world he would meet those of his pro-genitors who, perhaps, had neverheard the true Gospel, who never sawa prophet, apostle, or other inspiredman while in the flesh; and as Jesuswent and "preached to the spirits inprison" in His day, so would those men who now lived and held the keysof the Priesthood when they passed behind the veil also preach to "spiritsin prison," open the prison doors andlet the prisoners free. In all his laborsin the cause of this Gospel, for somesixty years, there was no kindof work which he had per-formed with greater satisfaction thanthat of redemption of his dead. Who could not, indeed, rejoice before the Lord when he contemplated the future of this great work in theRocky Mountains and the privilegeswhich they enjoyed?He was thankful the day had comewhen they had the opportunity of dedicating this Temple unto the Lord,and into which the vast number ofpeople who dwell in this region of country would be able to enter andperform the ordinances required ofthem without having to travel longdistances, as had been the casehitherto.He had seen some serioustimes in the history of thisChurch—at Kirtland for instance; but when he first heard JosephSmith preach he knew that he was aProphet of God. Of that he then hadall the testimony he needed. TheProphet Joseph, however, had laboredin the cause of this Church and King-dom about fourteen years only fromthe time of his ordination until he wasmartyred. He nevertheless performeda great mission.At his own advanced age he thankedGod that he was surrounded by a quorum of Apostles among whomthere existed such a spirit of unity; they were united as the heart of oneman. He firmly believed that anyone of them would die for him if needs be, and he would do thesame for either of them should theLord require it at his hands. There was a love between all of themthat the world knew not of—a lovewhich distinguished all men who borethe Priesthood from the rest of theworld.The Lord had always chosen theweak things of the earth to confoundthe wise, as He had promised; and thiswas a principle which he (the speaker)had thought much about from his boy-hood. His own view was that the Lordhad done this because He desired tochoose an element which He couldhandle and make use of. Many of theApostles of old were poor fishermen,but they were ready to yield up theirlives for the Gospel's sake, without anyregard whatever for the honors of the world.So in our own day and generation, Joseph Smith was called an ignorant,illiterate boy. In some respects he might have been, as the world under-stood it; but he was ordained, beforethe foundation of the world, to lay thefoundation of the Church and King-dom of God. Had not this been God'swork, and had it not been sustainedby His power from the very begin-ning? In proof of this the speakerinstanced the remarkable gathering ofthe Saints to these mountains andtheir wonderful preservation throughpersecution and trial. As with Joseph Smith, he said, so withPresidents Brigham Young and 
 596 THE DESERET NEWS. Oct 8APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid it is a consolation to know thatwe are engaged in the work of God; to live in this day when the eternal Priesthood has been committed to men, and when there is an organized Church of Christ on the earth. We should be thankful for the privilegeswe enjoy in this connection. But fewpeople comparatively of any age havebeen ready to receive the testimony of Jesus Christ and receive His Gospel. It is a narrow path to walk in. As we have learned, no man can live Godly inChrist Jesus without suffering perse-cution. There has never been a more unpopular doctrine among humanitythan that incorporated in the Gospel. Almost eighteen hundred years elaps-ed subsequent to the days of the anci-ent church established by Christ with-out any one having the privilege of be-holding the face of a directly authoriz-ed servant of God. His authority has been again restored, however, and the command has been given to go forth and prune his vineyard for thelast time. We occupy a different posi-tion from that of any people to whoma dispensation was ever committed. Each formerly has been dispelled — driv-en from the earth — because of the holdSatan has had over the hearts of men,but this dispensation cannot be re-moved. A promise has been given thatit shall remain until the purposes of the Most High in relation to the earthand its inhabitants have been consum-mated.We have been ordained of God to build temples, go therein and redeem our dead. This appears to be a specialfeature of this work, so far at least asits extent is concerned. We have hadconsiderable experience in the organ-ization of the Priesthood in its variousramifications. We have the variousquorums in their order, and in the sev-eral organizations the brethren should meet often together and instruct each other in the duties of their callings. All men in their several capacitiesshould improve thetr time and talents,that the power of God may be increased. The Word of Wisdomshould be obeyed. The Spirit of God will not dwell in unholy temples. Weare held responsible for the declara-tion of the Gospel to the Gentiles firstand then to the House of Israel. Wehave gone to nearly every nation where openings could be made for the intro-duction of the Gospel, and our efforts must not be slackened. There are the Lamanites, who are a fallen and de-graded people. God has given us aknowledge of the history of their forefathers. We have endeavored to teach them to reform from shedding the blood of their fellowmen, and thoseinstructions have had a salutary effect upon them. It is our duty to teachthem both by precept and example. After the Gentiles entirely turn from the Gospel it will be taken to theJews. How long it will be before that will take place does not appear.God has, as stated by PresidentTaylor, greatly blessed us, and weshould dedicate our entire substanceto the Lord. We are all on this earthon missions, and we have no other legitimate business than to build upthe Kingdom of God, concerning theglorious future of which we have nodoubt, as it will prevail and stand for-ever, in accordance with the predic-tions of the prophets. The speakercontinued to speak for some time uponthe free agency of man and the promi-ses of God to the faithful.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  Truth and Liberty.No. 17. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 14, 1894. VOL. XLVIIIANNUAL CONFERENCE.The Sixty-Fourth General Anniver-sary of the Church.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFdelivered a brief opening address. Heexpressed his gratitude to God for theprivilege the Saints enjoyed in assem-bling in the Sixty-fourth Annual Con-ference of the Church, and that there were present the entire First Presi-dency, ten of the Twelve Apostles,and other members of organizations and authorities. It was a mat-ter of congratulation that thework of the Lord was progressingat home and in the nations. The Lordwas with us and would continue to beso long as we sought the salvation ofour fellowmen and performed ourduties. The President spoke of thetestimonies which had been borne andleft on record by all the holy prophets,from Adam down, concerning theraising up of a Prophet in the latterdays to establish the Church of Christin fulness and prepare a people to meetthe Savior when he should come toreign during the millennium as Kingof Israel. He concluded by express-ing a fervent desire that the spirit ofinspiration and revelation might restupon speakers and hearers during thepresent Conference. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 17.  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 13, 1895.  VOL. L.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid: I feel that all our hearts this morning should be filled with grati-tude and thanksgiving to God, our Heavenly Father, for the blessings which we as a people enjoy. A long generation, as men count time, haspassed away with all its events con-nected with the last dispensation of thefullness of times, in our day and gen-eration. The Church of Christ has been organized in fulfilment of the revelations of God, which were given bymen who were moved upon by the gift of the Holy Ghost in their day and generation. Many nations and the islands of the sea have heard the proc-lamation of the Gospel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been organized, not only here, but among many nations, and tens of thousands of the sons of God have been gathered together, here in the land of Zion. The Gospel has been preachedaccording to the promises of God unto the nations, by men who have been called and sent forth to warn the in-habitants of the earth of those greatevents which are to come to pass before the coming of the Son of Man.We ourselves have passed throughmany of those scenes which have beenprophesied of by the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets called of God, and today we dwell here in the mountains of Israel. The Lord has enabled His peopleto rear temples to the name of the MostHigh God, here and in other parts of the earth; here the dead have been re-deemed and the living blessed, and the promises of God have been carried outaccording to His words to holy men from Abraham to Joseph Smith. I feel myself that we should be filled with gratitude for the blessings we en-joy from time to time. I hope and pray that while we assemble togetherwe may enjoy the Spirit of God and our hearts be united together as theheart of one man; that our prayers may be drawn out before the Lord, thatHis blessings may be with us and that those who speak to us may do so by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the power of God.I feel to thank God for myself that I have lived to see this day and havemingled with the brethren for so manyyears, and my life has still been preserved so that I may endeavor to do something with the Saints for the redemption of the chil-dren of men. I hope and pray thatthe blessings and power of God may rest upon the Apostles and Elders and the Saints of God while we are to-gether upon this occason. This is my desire and prayer unto the Lord myGod in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 W. H. CraganMarch 1 [18]95. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY 583PRESIDENT WOODRUFFmade a few closing remarks, in the course of which he bore testimony tothe excellence of the instructions givenby Presidents Cannon and Smith, andclosed with an exhortation to the Saintsto be prompt and liberal in paying their offerings for the support of the poor. 
 494  THE DESERET WEEKLY.John Taylor. Could they have been bought with gold or turned away from the work with which they had identified themselves? No; they were a class of men whom the Lord could handle and make use of, and the same remark applied to hundreds and thousands of Elders in Israel today who had been called from the plow and hammer, and many of whom had gone forth among the nations, carrying the Gospel message, without purse or scrip.This is the work of God and not of man; therefore let us try to live our religion, to do our duty, and to magni-fy our calling during the little time we have to live here on earth. Through all our trials, afflictions and tribulations we are growing here upon the tops of the mountains, in fulfillment of God's commands. The Lord is watching over us. Let us not be discouraged, but seek to do what is right. Remem-ber your prayers before the lord, keep the faith, and live in the way that you may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord; so that when we get through our mission here, our works will follow us to the other side of the vail. I pray God to bless you and to pour out His Holy Spirit upon this people. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY 211PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFthen arose and said: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yes, saith the Spirit, thatthey may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them."If there is a spirit on earth who will rest from his labors it is Brother Abra-ham Hoagland Cannon, whose body lies before us this afternoon; and hisworks will surely follow him. I havealmost felt that his labors were toomuch. He was overwhelmed with labor and care. He labored for the benefit of Israel, for his brethren, for the work of God; and certainly his de-parture from us is a heavy blow to us all. It is not confined to his wives and children, his father, his friends andrelatives; but it rests upon us all; weall feel the weight and force of it. I want to say a few words to his family and friends in relation to this blow that has fallen upon us as a Church, as a people, as well as upon his family. I will say that his father, President George Q. Cannon, has received this with all that patience and humility that belong to his charac-ter. I have hardly ever seen a man called to part with a son as he has exhibit the same composure and recon-ciliation to the will of God as Brother Cannon has. As to his brothers and sisters, it is a blow to them all. It has come suddenly upon them—unexpect-ed, we may say; and, of course, it is a trial. But there are two sides to this question. With regard to his wives and children, I want to say a few words upon that subject. I do notintend to talk long; but in order to an-swer my mind with regard to his fam-ily I have to pursue a course. I have never pursued before this people or before the world appertaining to this subject. I want to refer to the plurality of wives and to the plurality of families that men possess in this Church. It is a subject I have left alone as a general thing in all my observations and instructions before the public. I refer to it now because I want to allude to Brother Abraham's character.The course he has pursued has been before the world and the people. Ithas not been hid behind a bushel. Nor has been the course that the Latter-day Saints have pursued. It has been different in a great measure, from that of the inhabitants of the earth in our day and generation. We have had aplurality of wives and families. The principle was introduced to this peo-ple by the revelation of God through the Prophet Joseph Smith. This was carried out and practiced by a small percentage of the Latter-day Saints, until the time came when the law of the land forbade our carrying out that principle, and we submitted to the laws of the land, as a body and as a people, with regard to this principle. But I want to say this—and I want you to hear it; there is not one par-ticle of law on any statute book of the United States, or a ruling of any court, from the district court to the Supreme court of the United States, or by the President of the United States, or his cabinet, or the Congress of the United States, wherein a man who has received wives and children under the law of God is required to cast those wives and children into thestreet and make vagabonds of them.  No such law as this had been given, and if there were such a law it would be a very cruel one. Inasmuch asthese women have been taken underthe law, and have given themselves to our care, and have done so righteously, in virtue of holiness and uprightnessbefore the Lord, is any man justified in casting these women and children into the streets? No. And any manin this Church who has got a plurality of wives, given to him under the law of the Lord, who will not feed and clothes those wives and children, and educate, and take care of them, he is under condemnation before God. No man is justified in that. If I have any wives given to me of the Lord, it is my duty to take care of them, and to take care of their chil-dren, feed and clothe and educate them, and do what I can for their benefit. Why? Because they belong to me. They do not belong to any-body else, but will be mine in time and in eternity, if I do my duty and keep the commandments of God. And so it is with you. I hope there is not a man in this Church that will feel to cast off his wives and children because of the laws that have been enacted for our benefit.Brother Cannon has carried this principle out to perfection. He hasthoroughly provided for his wives, as far as I know, all alike. He has doneall in his power to lay a foundation to make them comfortable after his de-parture. He has done the same by his children. And he has been blessed in this principle. Therefore, I con-sider he is justified. He has finished his work here. He has gone into the spirit world. His mother is there, and, I suppose with him now. I have no doubt that they are rejoicing together. But he  has left a family. He has done all a mortal man could do to leave themcomfortable after his departure.  Brother Cannon has been a very peculiar man. He has been a man that never has complained scarcely of anything on earth. He has been will-ing to take a great load upon him, and to do all that he could for the benefit of the Church and of his brethren wher-ever he has been. Of course, his laborsare cut short, suddenly. But heawaits the morning of the resurrection, the coming forth with his wives and children, his father and mother, family and friends, to be united with them upon that occasion.I want to say to the children of Brother Abraham Cannon. It will be but a little while till your father will be with you, standing in his immortalbody and glory, that death cannot destroy nor affect. When I look and reflect upon this Church, upon theblessings and revelations of God, upon thesalvation of God, I consider that of all men and women under heaven we have the greatest reason to rejoice be-fore the Lord. We have had a gooddeal to do in our day and time, but the Lord has assisted us in performing this work. One goes, and another comes. I look around me, and how many there are departed from us! Yes, a large host have left this Church hereand gone to the grave with their bodies, while their spirits are in the spirit world preparing to return with the Lord Jesus Christ when He shall come in the clouds of heaven to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body. When I reflect upon this, and realize what a little time will elapse before Abraham Cannon will stand with his family and friends and the Saints of God in glory, In immortal bodies, I think these things should comfort us, and comfort our children and our families.Brethren and sisters, I find myself hoarse, and I do not feel that I cantalk much. But I felt I wanted to say so much to my friends and to mybrethren and sisters. I say, God blessyou. May God bless the father of Broth-er Abraham, and bless his wives and his children, his brothers and sisters, and all the family. They are a family that have been united in love. They have had a good example set them.  The blessings of God have been overthem. I hope and trust we may all pursue that course that we may be justified and be prepared to pass to the other side of the veil as he has done. God grant it, for Christ's sake. Amen.

A number of the Apostles havebeen unable to personally attend theseConferences or other open gatherings.Their voices have not been heard in-structing, encouraging, strengtheningand warning the Saints, or in the dis-charge of the other public duties whichdevolve upon them in connection withtheir ministry. It was proper, there-fore, that Epistles should be written tothe Church in which counsel could begiven and testimony be borne.

 President Wilford WoodruffSaid: Before the close of themeeting I have a request I want tomake of these Apostles, these HighPriests, Seventies and Elders, andthe Lesser Priesthood and all theLatter-day Saints who have anycommunion with God or with theHoly Ghost. Brother Merrill hasbeen talking of revelation. If therewas ever a time since God made theworld that the inhabitants of theearth needed revelation, it is today.Now, the Lord has given us thestick of Judah—the law of God tothe Jews—which reaches down toour day and generation, and whichshows us their history and has toldus what would come to pass withthem and what will come to pass inthe future. So has the Lord given usthe stick of Ephraim—the stick ofJoseph in the hands of Ephraim—giving the history of theinhabitants of this continentand what shall take place in thelast days. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] I hold in my handsa code of revelation (the Book ofDoctrine and Covenants) given toJoseph Smith, the Prophet. Thereare some of the most sublime revela-tions in that book God ever gave toany generation, or to any prophetor people under heaven. This bookof revelations, like other records,will go down to the end of time andinto eternity. These revelations giveyou the whole history of the celes-tial kingdom, of the terrestrial king-dom and of the telestial Kingdomof our God. But we want revela-tion every day. Well, you say, thePresident of the Church should giverevelation. Yes, it is true, thePresident holds the keys of givingrevelation to the Latter-day Saints.But is he alone to give revelation?No, verily, not. There is not anApostle in this Church, there is notan Elder in this Church that standsup in this congregation to teach thispeople, but should be full of revela-tion. There is where your revela-tion should come—from those whoteach you day by day.How many revelations did Brig-ham Young give that were writtento the people? Very few. Howmany has John Taylor given that were written to the people? Veryfew. How many has Wilford Wood-ruff given? Very few. We have

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President WoodruffStated that it had been customary forsome time past to read reports and present the authorities of the Churchto the general assembly on the lastday of Conference. There would be a departure from that rule this time so as to reserve tomorrow exclusivelyfor preaching, and the presentationswould be made this afternoon.President George Q. Cannonstated that as some of the Presi-dents of Stakes had failed to for-ward their reports, although theyhad been requested to send them, only an incomplete, general report could be made up, and the reading of it would be dispensed with.President Wilford Woodruffwas the first speaker. Following isa brief synopsis of his discourse: I feel that every heart in this congre-gation should be filled with grati-tude and thanksgiving to our Heavenly Father for the blessingswhich we enjoy this morning, thatso many of us have the privilege of meeting in this Tabernacle in peaceand quietude to worship Him.Neither the President of thisChurch, nor his Counselors, nor theTwelve Apostles, nor any man whodwells in the flesh has any power ofhimself to instruct or edify the Saints; he can only do soby the power and blessingof the Almighty. We are alldependent upon the Lord. TheProphet Joseph was a humble man;he was chosen as one of the weak in-struments in the hands of the Lord, raised up in this last dispensation tolay the foundation of this greatChurch and kingdom of God uponthe earth. He was taught by theadministration of angels. He knewfull well that his strength lay inGod and not in himself; and that isour condition at the present time.Whenever the President of thisChurch or any of those in authorityfeel in their hearts that the Lord can-not do without them in the carryingon of His work they stand on slippery ground. What did Joseph Smithsay when Oliver cowdery told himthat he was the second apostle in this Church and kingdom and thatif he left the Church it would fall?His reply was, "Oliver, you try it."Oliver Cowdery did try it, and hefell, but the kingdom did not.The Lord is not dependent upon any one man or any set of men forthe carrying on of His work.We have been called in this day a generation to go forth and preachthe Gospel of Jesus Christ, to theGentiles first and then to the houseof Israel. This has been my lot. It

 had some, though not revealed tothe people, perhaps, or published.But we want revelation everyday. And I want these Apostlesand these Saints to go before theLord in your secret places and askHim to pour out revelations uponthis people, that we may give youthe word of the Lord while we arewith you, and that these Apostles,when they speak, may speak by thepower of God, by the Holy Ghost.Then that will be the word of theLord, it will be scripture, it will bethe power of God unto salvation un-to every one that believes. Godbless you. Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruffspoke as follows:In the providence of God we areagain called to pay our last respects andto attend to the burial of another one ofthe Apostles of the Lamb of God,raised up in the last dispensation andfulness of times. In the few remarkswhich I shall make this morning Ishall not attempt to enter into thehistory or life, particularly, of Coun-selor Wells. This has already beenpresented through the press, and willbe fully perhaps by those who mayfollow me. It is sufficient for meto say that Brother Wells has beenin this Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints over forty-fiveyears. He has been closely allied andconnected with all the Prophets andApostles that have been identifiedwith this Church during that period ofhis life. He has been true and faithfulto the Church, to the Kingdom of God,to the inhabitants of the earth, to thePresidencies of the Church and to theApostles during this period of his life.It is known to the Latter-day Saints—many of them, at least—of the diligentlabor which he has been called to passthrough during his sojourn in theChurch and Kingdom of God.This Church has been organizedsixty-one years the sixth of the comingmonth. During that period the Lordhas raised up Prophets and Apostles,Elders and Saints, many of whom havelaid the foundation of the Church andKingdom of God on the earth and havelabored therein. But time has calledthem to the other side of the veil. Af-ter finishing their work here in theflesh, the Lord has called them home;and when they pass to the other side ofthe veil their missions are not closed;they have a work to perform there, aswell as they have while tabernaclingin the flesh on the earth. For somecause or reason unbeknown to me, Ihave lived to attend the funerals andfollow to the grave a great share of theProphets and Apostles and many ofthe Saints who have labored in thisChurch in their day and generation.I will express myself here to myfriends, as I have done on many occa-sions, with regard to funerals, withregard to death, and with regard togoing into the spirit world. I havenever felt to mourn in my spirit to fol-low any Prophet, any Apostle, anySaint of the living God to the gravewho has been true and faithful to God,who has been true and faithful to Hiscovenants, who has received the Gospelof Jesus Christ and the ordinancesthereof, and the holy Priesthood. Suchmen and women have filled their mis-sion here upon earth with honor, withlabor, with love, until they have beencalled home. They have died in thefaith, and they will receive a crown ofglory. Those have been my feelingsin the death of President Young,Brother Kimball, Brother Taylor, theTwelve Apostles, and all men who havereceived the Gospel of Christ and beentrue and faithful in that mission. Thereis an eternal reality—which the wholeworld will find out—in life. There is aneternal reality in death. There is aneternal reality in the resurrection, andin the future judgments, and in God'sdealings with all men in the future ac-cording to the deeds done in the body;and when a man or a woman who hasentered into covenant with the Lord,who has received the Gospel and theordinances thereof, and been true andfaithful in his or her day and genera-tion, has been called home intothe spirit world, where is theman who comprehends theseprinciples that can mourn forthat brother or sister? Here lies be-fore us the tabernacle of CounselorDaniel H. Wells. His death has beensudden to us. I did not know that hewas sick, or that he was in the city, 
 President Wilford Woodruffsaid he felt very much gratified inmeeting with so large a congregationof the Latter-day Saints upon a work-ing day. It spoke well for Zion and forthe Saints themselves. He had madeup his mind before Brother Thatcherspoke to occupy a few moments thatafternoon in expressing his views upontemporal things, and Brother Thatcherhad certainly opened the way leadingto that opportunity.After dilating upon the work of Godin the beginning of creation, andshowing how our Heavenly Fatherplaced temporal matters in thehands of men, the speaker re-marked that the Lord did not callupon their enemies to build their Tem-ples and habitations. The circum-stances attending the building of Solo-mon's temple were referred to, and,turning next to the organization ofthis Church, President Woodruff ob-served that when the pioneers came to 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFadded a few remarks on the subject onwhich had spoken in the morning-- the experience of the Church in Kirt-land, when a number of the Apostles and other leading men apostatized. Hethen exhorted the Saints to serve God.The[y] could not serve two masters, and should elect to serve the Almighty and be united in that service. The Lord required His Saints to bear off His kingdom. In doing this they would have power with the heavens, for theLord would not turn His back uponZion.Speaking of the First Presidencyand Twelve, President Woodruff statedthat if ever a body of men wereunited they were; the Saints would befoolish to permit anything to divide them. 
 general subjects in the previousEpistles are so copious, and apply sodirectly to the entire lives and sur-roundings of the Saints, that we deemit not necessary to repeat them at thepresent time or to write a lengthy Epistle.OPPOSITION CONFRONTING THE SAINTSNo people of whom we have anyknowledge have been called upon topass through such scenes and to havesuch a peculiar experience as theLatter-day Saints. The trials and dif-ficulties we have had to content with,so numerous and so varied in character, have scarcely been equalled inour generation. But those we havehad to meet during the past three orfour years, and which still confrontus, are new even in our experienceThey have come upon us in a newshape. Originating in the same source,prompted by the same spirit, and de-signed for the same end, as other plans which have been put into operation forour injury and overthrow, the presentattack which is made upon us, differslargely in many of its features andmethods from anything we have everhad to encounter. We have been ledto expect from the beginning that asthe work of God grew and developedin the earth, the resistance to it wouldbecome more formidable and wide-spread, would increase in intensityand vigor, and bring into antagonismto it more influential powers. Thishas ever been the voice of prophecyand testimony unto us concerning thefuture of the work of God whichwe have espoused. If, then,we have not been prepared for thesetrials which we now have to overcome,it has not been because we have notbeen warned of their approach. Bythe testimony of His Spirit and by thevoices of His faithful servants, Godhas given His people ample time forpreparation. And the Latter-daySaints who have lived so as to enjoythe spirit of their religion have ex-pected, and have prepared themselves tomeet, such trials as have come upon us,and others which may yet be in reservefor us before the final victory isachieved over Satan and the embattledpowers of darkness.THE PRIVILEGE OF REVELATIONIt is this pre-knowledge which Godhas given concerning His work, andwhich He constantly imparts as it isneeded to His people, which is one ofthe chief causes of the strength possessed by the Latter-day Saints. It isthe principle of revelation from theHead of the Church to the Church itself--a principle which in its operation isnot confined to one man, or to threemen, or to twelve men; but is extendedto every individual in the Church, ingreater or less degree, as each onechooses to avail himself of it Thereis an appointed way, however, bywhich revelation from the Lord for thegovernment of His Church is receivedThere is but one man on the earth,at a time, who holds this power. Butevery individual member has the priv-ilege of receiving revelation from theLord for his guidance in his own af-fairs and to testify to him concerningthe correctness of public teachings andmovements.The great promise which accompanies the preaching of the Gospel, asrevealed from heaven in our day, isthat the Holy Ghost will be bestowedupon the sincerely penitent who obeyits holy ordinances. Through theHoly Ghost a knowledge of thingspast, present and to come is communicated and the mind and will of theFather made known. In this way theAlmighty reveals His purposes to thosewho obey His commandments andwhose lives are pure and acceptablebefore Him, so that they can be pre-pared for all the events and trials thatmay lie in their pathway.If there are any members of theChurch who do not know by their ownexperience that this is true, they maybe assured that they do not live up totheir privileges. All Saints should bein close communion with the HolyGhost, and, through it, with the Fa-ther, or there is danger of their beingovercome of evil and falling by thewayside.We, therefore, say to the Latter-daySaints: The Holy Ghost will not dwellin an unholy tabernacle. If you wouldenjoy the full powers and gifts of yourreligion, you must be pure. If you areguilty of weaknesses, follies and sins,you must repent of them; that is, youmust thoroughly forsake them. In noother way can we please God. "Manof holiness" is His name, and He de-lights in the efforts of His children tobe pure.ABSENCE OF OFFICERS OF THE CHURCH.We feel led to speak in this strain,for the reason that while the Latter-day Saints in order to prosper in theirreligion and to increase in the knowl-edge of God must always live close toHim, the present is an extraordinarytime which appears to require morehelp and strength from the Lord thanusual.  The Church has been left, asnever for so long a time before, with-out the public ministrations of a num-ber of the men to whom its membershavelooked for instruction and counsel.Not only has the number of theApostles who could minister in publicbeen greatly reduced, but the samecauses which have relegated them toseclusion have had the effect to keepmany Presidents of Stakes and theircounselors, Bishops and their coun-selors, as well as High Councilors andother active men in the priesthood,from officiating in their callings Thepeople have felt the absence of thesemen and the loss of their teachings andguidance. But has the Lord, on thisaccount forgotten His people? No,certainly not. The prayers of thefaithful men of God, who have beenprevented from ministering to thepeople, and whose hearts have beenfull of love and earnest desire for theirwelfare, have been constantly offeredto the Lord that He would have mercyon His flock, that He would make up tothem, by the more abundant outpour-ing of His Holy Spirit, for the depriva-tion to which they have been subjectedin not having the presence of many ofHis servants among them.THE HAND AND PURPOSES OF GOD.The Savior said, "It is impossiblebut that offenses will come; but," headded, "woe unto them through whomthey come." In our case offenceshave come, and it has appeared that wecould not avoid them. Shall we notacknowledge the hand of God in thatwhich has taken place in our land andwhich affects us so deeply? We whohave seen in all our affairs, and in allthe events which have happened to us,His providence so visibly manifested,must feel that the occurrences of thepast three or four years have been per-mitted by Him for a wise purpose. Wecannot suppose that these happeningshave been by chance and without a de-sign. God has not so dealt with us inthe past. Mysterious as have beenmany things when we had them to en-counter, time has never failed to throwlight upon and explain them. Whenthey happened we, perhaps,acknowledged the hand ofthe Lord in them, because of the Lord having said weshould do so; but this was upon theprinciple of faith. Afterwards, how-ever, we have looked back to theseevents, and seeing how wondrouslyGod had wrought, we, in the fullnessof our hearts and in view of the re-sults, have acknowledged, not in faithbut in developed knowledge, thatGod's hand was in all that had oc-curred. So with the experience, pain-ful though it be, which we are nowgaining.God has a purpose to accomplish inpermitting the treatment which wehave received. Whatever the result toothers who have prompted and beenactive in pushing it, to us it cannot beanything but profitable and beneficial,if we receive it in the right spirit andbear it patiently. One good effect isapparent. The Latter-day Saints arecompelled, perhaps to a greater extentthan ever before, to think and actfor themselves and not to dependso much upon others to lead them.Some, not having lived so as to havethe presence and guidance of theHoly Ghost, may stumble and fall.But those who have lived up to theirprivileges will find that God has notforgotten His promises and has notleft His people to themselves, norwithout a testimony as to the coursethey should pursue.THE SAINTS MUST BE TESTED.The pathway of the people of Godhas been beset with difficulties Theyhave been environed with dangers.Dark clouds have almost enshroudedthem. But amidst all these, the still,small voice of the Spirit of God hasbeen heard. His Saints have had atestimony from Him that the coursethey have been led to take is the rightone and that He will never fail tomake known His mind and will tothem so long as they live up to His re-quirements.It appears plain that it is God's pur-pose to suffer His Saints to bethoroughly tried and tested, so thatthey may prove their integrity andknow the character of the foundationupon which they build. Many thingshave occurred during the last twelvemonths which are well adapted to testthe faith and integrity of the people.It does not seem possible that thosewho do not live so as to have the lightof the Holy Ghost shining in their soulscan escape doubts and fears concern-ing the work of God.  So many thingshave occurred which are entirely dif-ferent to pre-conceived notions as tothe course that would be taken inbuilding up Zion that each one needs tohave a knowledge for himself to clear-ly understand that God is leading us inthe path which we are now pursuing.To some who are inclined to despondand to take a gloomy view of affairs,the ship Zion may, perhaps, appear tobe drifting away from its old moorings,because things are being done ormovements consented to which, totheir eyes, portend disaster to us andto the work of God.UNJUST CRITICISMThere has always been a few amongus who have been filled with evil fore-bodings, and who have failed to see thewisdom of God in the steps which Hispeople have been led to take. Theyhave questioned and found fault withthe counsel that has been given andthe measures which have been adopted,and have asserted that revelation hadceased and the Saints were no longerguided by men to whom God madeknown His will. The prophet Josephduring his lifetime did not escape thecriticism and censure of this class.He was often accused of being a fal-len prophet and of leading the Churchastray. During the long presidency ofPresident Brigham Young, the samecharges were made, and many aposta-tized because they believed, as theystated, that he was no longer led bythe Lord. Experience has proved thatin all such cases those who make theseaccusations are themselves in thedark.But the faithful people--those whohave lived strictly in accordance withtheir profession as Saints and with therequirements of the Gospel--havenot been assailed by doubts ofthis character. There might be manythings which they could not clearlyunderstand, the reasons for whichmight not be fully apparent to them atthe time; but possessing the Spirit ofGod, and being led by it, they trustedin the Lord and felt satisfied to leavethe management of His kingdom andits affairs to His supreme wisdom.Time developed to their minds thecorrectness of the course which theChurch had been led to adopt. Thishas occurred so frequently in ourcareer that the instances will readilysuggest themselves to those familiarwith our history. In this way, how-ever, the faith of the people has beenconstantly tested.THE ANOINTING THE SAINTS HAVE RECEIVED.The Apostle John, in speaking to theSaints in his day, said: "But theanointing which ye have received ofhim abideth in you, and ye need notthat any man teach you: but as thesame anointing teacheth you of allthings, and is truth, and is no lie, andeven as it hath taught you, ye shallabide in him."The Saints in our days have receivedthis same anointing and they shouldbe in a position to not be dependentupon man to teach and tell them thatwhich is right. They have had a floodof instruction given to them in daysthat are past. This instruction hascovered the entire policy of buildingup the kingdom of God on the earthOf this continued instruction they havebeen to a great extent deprived of late.It has appeared to be the design ofProvidence that they should be left toshow to the heavens, to each other andto the world whether the truths theyhave been taught have had the propereffect upon them, or not--whetherwhen left to a certain extent to them-selves they will be governed in theirdaily lives and acts by principle--prin-ciple to the truth of which testimonyhas been borne by the Holy Ghost--orby the spirit and customs of Babylon by which they are surrounded, butfrom which they are supposed to begathered out.NECESSITY OF SELF-EXAMINATION.The present is an appropriate timefor each member of the Church to in-dulge in self-examination--to measurehis conduct and life in the fulllight of the heavenly principles revealed to us. Ours is no ordinarycalling. Great opportunities andprivileges have been bestowed uponus. To us, as a people, has been en-trusted the grand and glorious laborof laying the foundation of the king-dom of God upon the earth. Everyact of our lives should be performedwith this in view. Nothing should bedone by any one calling himself a Lat-ter-day Saint that will conflict withthe policy which God has announcedas proper to be adopted in establish-ing that kingdom. In this connec-tion there are questions which eachone should ask himself: Do I, in allmy words and influence and in all thetransactions of my life, constantlykeep before me the advancement andprosperity of the Zion of God as thefirst and most important considera-tion? Do I, through covetousness ora desire for personal profit and advantage, depart from that line of conductwhich God, through His Spirit and theteachings of His servants, has said HisSaints should follow? Do I, by mywords and acts, set such an examplebefore my family that my children willgrow up to manhood and womanhoodfully imbued with a love of Zion andwith an understanding of the principles upon which Zion will be built up.Many more questions of a similarcharacter each one can ask himself inthe process of self-examination. Ifthese can be answered correctly, thereneed be no fears indulged in concern-ing the effect of the Edmunds-Tuckerlaw, the confiscation suits, the statemovement, the "boom" as it is called, orany other measure which may beadopted either in favor of or againstthe Zion of God. Respecting all thesemovements, about which there is moreor less agitation and concern and per-haps excitement, there need be nofears if the Latter-day Saints will onlybe true to the covenants they havemade with their God and strictly carryout the principles which He has toldus must govern us in the building upof His Zion.CONSEQUENCES OF FORGETTING COVENANTS.If, however, we forget our cove-nants, and depart from and disregardthe teachings which He has given us,then be assured, Latter-day Saints, ourposition is full of peril to us God'spurposes will not be thwarted; but weshall be scourged, and those who per-sist in this course will be rejected andbe deprived of all share in the bles-sings promised to Zion. Where thoseprofessing to be Latter-day Saintsknowingly and flagrantly act incontravention of the counselswhich he has given us, then we havecause to fear and the plots of thewicked against us, joined by the foolishdisobedience and rebellion of pro-fessed Saints, become a serious men-ace to the peace, prosperity and pro-gress of Zion.Praying the Lord to endow every of-ficer of the Church who desires tomagnify his calling, with every gift andqualification which belongs to thePriesthood which he bears, and to fillthe members of the Church with theHoly Ghost and its gifts.I remain your Brother and Servantin Christ Jesus,WILFORD WOODRUFFIn behalf of the Quorm of the Twelve.April 6th, 1888. 
 DISCOURSEDelivered at the General Conferenceof the Church, in the Tabernacle,Salt Lake City, Sunday, October 6th,1895, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-President Woodruff read from ##Doctrine and Covenants 68|Sec-tion 68## of the Book of Doctrine and Cov-enants, as follows:My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by hisordinance to proclaim the everlasting gospel,by the Spirit of the everlasting God, from peo-ple to people, and from land to land, in thecongregations of the wicked, in their syna-gogues, reasoning with, and expounding allScriptures unto them.And, behold, and lo! this is an ensampleunto all those who were ordained unto thispriesthood, whose mission is appointed untothem to go forth;And this is the ensample unto them, thatthey shall speak as they are moved unto bythe Holy Ghost,And whatsoever they shall speak whenmoved upon by the Holy Ghost, shall bescripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall bethe mind of the Lord, shall be the word of theLord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and thepower of God unto salvation:Behold this is the promise of the Lord untoyou, O ye my servants;Wherefore be of good cheer, and do not fear,for I the Lord am with you, and will stand byyou; and ye shall bear record of me, evenJesus Christ, that I am the Son of the livingGod, that I was, that I am, and that I am tocome.He then said:I have read these verses this morningbefore you that you may understand theposition that I occupy before God, an-gels and men. I have a desire to speaka short time to the Latter day Saints;but I want you to understand, as I haveread here, that I am not capable, nor isany man capable of teaching the chil-dren of men and edifying them in theGospel of Jesus Christ without the HolySpirit, without revelation, without theinspiration of Almighty God. Therefore,I want the faith of the Latter day Saints,and alao [also] their prayers. I need theSpirit of God to assist me, as does everyman who attempts to teach the peoplethe things of the kingdom of heaven. Ihave been sick for about a week, con-fined mostly to my bed and room; but Ihave felt that I did not wish this confer-ence to pass without meeting you. Forthe last day or two I have had the privi-lege of mingling with my friends, and Ihave a desire to express myself uponsome things appertaining to our dayand generation and to the work of God.The question arises in the minds ofthe people in our day and generation,Does President Woodruff have revela-tion? Do his counselors have revelation?Do the Twelve Apostles have revela-tion? Do this people have revelation?We live in too important a day and gen-eration, and in the midst of too impor-tant events, for any man to be qualifiedto lead the people of God one hour with-out revelation and inspiration from Al-mighty God. And at this point I wantto say a few words with regard to thisprinciple of revelation. Read the historyof the world. Old father Adam, threeyears and a half previous to his death,called together seven of his sons, allHigh Priests—Seth, Enos, Jared, Ma-hallaleel, Canaan, Enoch and Methu-saleh—with the residue of his posterity,and there he stood on his feet for a longtime, clothed with the Holy Ghost andthe power of God, and he prophesiedunto his sons what should take placeconcerning them and their posterityto the end of time. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Follow this out;take all those early patriarchs andprophets, and later ones, too, and they allhave had revelation. They had to haveit. Whenever a city became ripened ininiquity, and men blasphemed God andbroke His commandments, the LordAlmighty raised up prophets and in-spired men to warn that city and theinhabitants thereof of the judgments ofGod which should come upon them un-less they repented. Jeremiah wascalled to warn Jerusalem and Judea inthe reign of King Zedekiah, and in doingso he stirred up the anger of the peopleagainst him, and he was cast into a dun-geon and abused in almost every way,because he told them what was comingto pass unless they repented. He didnot praise them; but he told them thatthey were committing sin and breakingthe laws of God, and if they did not re-pent, the judgments of God would over-take them. [##Jeremiah 37-38##] In reading of how theypersecuted him and what he passedthrough, a man would almost expect toread in the book of Jeremiah that hesaid to them, "You may all go to hellfor what I care, I am not going to endurethese things." But you cannot read itthere; for the Lord in calling him hadsaid unto Jeremiah:"Before I formed thee in the belly Iknew thee, and before thou camestforth out of the womb I sanctified thee,and I ordained thee a prophet unto thenations." [##Jeremiah 1:5-7##]Jeremiah gave forth the word of theLord, and not one word fell unfulfilled.And so with every other prophet.Take the whole history of the worlddown to the present generation, and hasthere ever been a time when the peopleof God did not need revelation? I say,nay. Now, I would ask this congrega-tion; I would ask the Jews, the Catho-lics, the Protestants, I would ask theclergy of all nations: Can this mightydispensation, of which every prophethas spoken, be fulfilled, and can thesegreat events transpire in the earth, with-out revelation from God? No, most as-suredly not. God never gave to a mana greater dispensation than the one inwhich Joseph Smith was called and or-dained of God to organize the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Itrequired revelation. It will require it tothe winding-up scene. Zion cannot bebuilt up without it, prophets and apostlescannot do their work without it, nor canthe nations of the earth be warned of thegreat judgments that are at the doorwithout it. Therefore, we say to allmen, Joseph Smith was called of Godby revelation. And further, we saythat no man ever did or ever will havepower to warn the world, to preach theGospel, or administer in one of the or-dinances of the house of God withoutthe Holy Priesthood. It is just as nec-essary in the last days as it was in thedays of Christ and His Apostles, or inthe days of Isaiah and Jeremiah. Youcannot separate these things; they be-long to the same God, to the same sal-vation, to the same principles of eternallife.I have sat and listened to every Apos-tle that is before me now bear recordduring this conference. Did not theseApostles speak by the Holy Ghost andthe power of God? They did, and theirtestimony is recorded in the great libraryof the celestial kingdom of God. Theycould not edify us without it. I wouldto God that the inhabitants of the earthwould get rid of the idea that revelationceased when Christ was put to death.It is a false doctrine. Revelation be-longs to the salvation of the children ofmen.Again, why did the Lord choose sucha weak man as Wilford Woodruff to pre-side over His Church? Why did Hechoose Joseph Smith—an illiterate boy, ashe was called? Why has He chosenthat class of men? Because He couldhandle them. He has chosen men thatwill acknowledge the hand of God. Thequestion has been asked me many times,Why did not the Lord choose some ofthe great divines of the day? Becauseit is not His manner of doing business;it never has been. You may take theapostles and prophets in any age of theworld, and they have been very humblemen. They are in this day and genera-tion, or the Lord could not handle them.That is the reason the Lord has chosenthe weak things of the world to confoundthe wise, "and things which are not, tobring to nought things that are." [##1 Corinthians 1:27-28##] CouldJoseph Smith rise up and boast beforethe God of Israel that that was hiswork? Could Brigham Young? CouldJohn Taylor? Can Wilford Woodruff? 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRISTOF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA.P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U.T. Nov 20th 1896.President WoodruffDear Brother:I have had a desire for a long timeto lay a matter before you whichI consider of Great Importance,and in asmuch as this life is short,and especially so, with us that areadvanced in age. I now being in myeighty third year.The matter whichI wish to present to you you willfind in the Book of D. & C.

 REMARKSMade at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday afternoon, February 13th, 1898 byPRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]There is a saying that "whatever leads to good and to do good, is of God;whatever leads to evil and to do evil, is of that wicked one." The first re-mark I wish to make is in relation to the mystery in my mind concerningevents that have transpired since theworld was made and God created man.We all belong to Him. We do not belong to the devil. He never made us. Henever made the world. He does not ownit. But he is here on earth. The mys-tery to me is why the God of heavenis so much more unpopular than thedevil on the face of the earth; why the inhabitants of the earth, who are the children of God, feel so much more prone to do that that is evil than tofollow the commandments of God. The Son of God, when He came to the earth in the meridian of time, died to save the world. [##Matthew 27##] The devil did not do it. StillJesus Christ was the most unpopularman that tabernacled in the flesh in Hisday and generation. He had more ene-mies than almost any other being that ever lived. The nation in which He dwelt warred against Him, and after a little while they put Him to death. Why do men feel that the devil is of so much more consequence than Christ, and show themselves more ready to do evil than good? There is no being that has power to save the souls of men and give them eternal life, except the Lord Jesus Christ, under the command of His Father. Take the whole history of the world, from Father Adam down to this day, and the commandments of God and those ordinances that will save men have always been very un-popular. How was it in the days of Jesus? Jesus spent about three years and a half after He entered the ministry, and then He was put to death. They warred against Him and His principles; andnot only against Him but also against His followers. His Apostles were all put to death, excepting one, and he would have been destroyed ifthe people could have killed him; butJohn the Revelator was preserved by the power of God, while the others wereslain. Why were they killed? They were unpopular. The world did not re-ceive their doctrines. Read the history of the world in the days of Adam, Seth,Enos, Jared, Mahalaleel, Canaan, Me-thusaleh, Noah, when men lived al-most a thousand years, and you will find that even in those early times the children of men turned against God.They sought that that was evil, and pursued a course wherein the Lord was angry with them, and He swept them off the face of the earth with a flood.Noah and his family were saved, and the only ones that were saved. [##Genesis 6##] Do you ever meditate upon this strange pre-sentation to our minds in the history of the dealings of God with men? It does not matter what age of the world you look at, whenever the Lord has raised up Prophets and Apostles, Pas-tors and Teachers, and commanded them to do a work, they have been un-popular and their work has been un-popular. Take Jeremiah, for instance.  When the Lord sent him forth to teach and warn the people he was very un-popular. They put him in the stocks; they cast him into a pit: they persecut-ed him continually, until it seems to me he must have felt like saying, "You may all go to hell, for aught I care; I am not going to bother my soul about you any longer." [##Jeremiah 20:1-2##] But he could not do that. The Lord had said to him in sending him forth:"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the nations." [##Jeremiah 1:5##]He commanded Jeremiah to go and do as He commanded. What was theconsequence? Jeremiah was persecut-ed, and when he complained of the con-dition of things, the Lord told him to go unto Zedekiah, the king of Jerusa-lem, who had persecuted him, and say unto him that the judg-ments of God would come upon him, his eyes would be put out, he would be carried captive to Babylon, and he would die in captivity. [##Jeremiah 34:1-5##]I need not dwell upon these things: but they are worthy the contemplationof the Latter-day Saints. It has seemed such hard work to do right, and so easy to do evil. Temptation to do evil is on every hand, from the day of our birth until we go to the grave.How is it in our day? These Latter-day Saints know our position. TheGod of heaven sent an angel to JosephSmith. That angel taught him manythings, and told him what to do.Among other things, he told him there was a record of the ancient inhabitants of this land hid up in the hill Cumorah and commanded him, in due time, togo forth and receive that record and translate it into the English language. We have that record before us, and it is true. It has come forth in fulfill-ment of revelation.  John the Revela-tor said:"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."Saying with a loud voice. Fear God, and give glory to Him: for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##]That angel appeared to Joseph Smith in his youth. The Lord also gave untohim many revelations. He received the Holy Priesthood from under the hands of heavenly messengers who held thekeys of the Priesthood. He received the Aaronic Priesthood and the Mel-chisedek Priesthood, by the administra-tion of angels from God out of heaven. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##] He organized the Church of Crist. Thatman lived fourteen years after he en-tered into the ministry. He brought forth the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants; he organized the Church, and then he, like the Apos-tles of old, was slain for the word of God and testimony of Jesus.What has been the history of the Latter-day Saints, even on this greatAmerican continent, and under one of the most liberal governments God evergave to man? Joseph was tormented and persecuted. His followers werepersecuted. They were driven from the lands they occupied, and scarcely had a place to plant their feet. Tribulation followed them, until they were com-pelled to come to these valleys of the mountains. We have had a hard timeto live in a free country like America and under our great and glorious gov-ernment. Why this persecution, why this oppression and this opposition? Why this warring of the world against the Gospel of Jesus Christ? There isbut one Gospel; there never was but one, and never will be but one Gospel. That Gospel God has revealed to us. It is the Gospel of faith in the LordJesus Christ, repentance of sin, bap-tism for the remission of sins, the re-ception of the Holy Ghost by the lay-ing on of hands, and the gifts and grac-es following those who embrace thoseprinciples. You are my witnesses ofthe truth of these things. We have found it to be an uphill work to get therights of American citizens. God has established us here in these valleys ofthe mountains. We came here as pio-neers. We found a barren desert, with no mark of the white man anywhere.You see what there is today. It is infulfillment of the revelations of God.Why is this spirit in men to persecute one another, to fight against God and His people, as has been the case from the creation of the world down to our day more or less? It is wrong, and ev-ery man that takes a course of thiskind will have to bear the burden of it. There is but one power in heaven oron earth that can give man a part in the first resurrection, clothed withglory, immortality and eternal life, and that power comes from God, and notfrom the evil one. We ought to look at these things as they are.I have a few remarks I want to make on a certain subject con-nected with this. We have, as you allknow, lately put forth before the public a document concerning a cer-tain man who has been associated with us—that is, Colonel Isaac Trumbo. It has been a marvel to a great many why the Presidency of the Church put that forth and published it to the world. It is because what we wrote there, brethren and sisters, is true. Whether he is unpopular or not, it makes no difference to us. We have had so few men who have not been in this Church that have stepped forth and done what he and some others have done, we have felt it our duty to acknowledge it. I want to say to you, one and all, thatI do not want to have Colonel Trumbogo before God, whether before or after the resurrection, or any other time, and say that Wilford Woodruff, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, deprived him of the honor that he should have had for trying to assist the people in their calamities and in obtaining a State government for Utah, etc., as we have rehearsed in that paper. I am willing to acknowledge Colonel Trumbo, or any other man, who has gone forth as hehas for years and assisted us in the days of our trial. He is responsible for his own acts. We have had some friends in the midst of our difficulties. It has been uphill work with us allthe way through in these valleys of the mountains, but we have managed topull through, by the blessings of God and the labors of a few friends withour own. Colonel Trumbo was one of those friends. He took hold and laboredwith us, and I feel it is my duty to acknowledge him before my brethren. I do it for that reason. I would do it for any other man that labored with us. We have had a great many that labored against us and for our destruc-tion. We have had to bear these things from the organization of this Church. I was associated with Joseph Smith from 1833 to the time of his death. After his death I was associated with Brig-ham Young. I brought him into this valley in my carriage. I traveled with him and labored with him up to the day of his death. So with John Taylor, and so with the Apostles and this people. I know, as God lives, that this is the work of God. I know the Gospel has been revealed to us, and we have it. It is our duty to abide by it. Inasmuch as we will do this the blessings of heaven will attendus, and we will have power to build upZion in fulfillment of the promises of God. I am a firm believer myself in rewards and punishments, and in the gifts and graces of the Gospel. I have from my childhood been a firm believerin the Patriarchs, the Prophets, and the teachings of Jesus Christ. What He and His Apostles taught was true. They were put to death for those truths, and so have our leaders been put to death for those truths. Some of us have been preserved in the earth. The Latter-day Saints are gathering together to fulfill these revelations thathave been given to us. Let any man read the revelations in the Bible; readthe ##Isaiah 49:13-16|49th chapter## of Isaiah:"Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth: and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the Lord has comforted 
 our hearts should be filled this morn-ing with gratitude and thanksgiving,that we have the privilege again ofmeeting in an Annual Conference ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hope and trust thatthe hearts of the Saints will be liftedup in prayer to God, that during thetime we shall spend together in thiscapacity, the spirit and power ofGod may rest upon the Apostles andElders who will address us, and uponthe Saints themselves who may hear.I feel very thankful myself that Istill have the privilege of meeting ingeneral Conference with the Saintsof God. I realize that we are weakinstruments in the hands of God whoare called to perform this work. TheLord has chosen the weak things ofthe world from the foundation of theearth, to perform His work in everyage and generation of men. I praythat the Apostles and Elders of Israelmay be clothed upon with the Spiritand power of God while they addressthe Latter-day Saints. We want tobear in mind that our strength, ourhope and our power is in the handsof God, and not in men. The LordHimself has stretched forth His handto establish this Church, His king-dom, His work, His Zion, the gather-ing together of His people in fulfill-ment of the revelations of God whichhave been given to the inhabitants ofthe earth since the foundation of theworld--since the day of the old Patri-arch, Father Adam, was broughtforth, and placed in the Garden ofEden. [##Genesis 2:15##] From that day until now Hiswork has been performed by the in-spiration of Almighty God, and notby the power of man. The very thingsin our history that we have been calledto pass through; the scenes whichhave been enacted and shown andthey show to-day to all heaven andearth, in the warfare, in the opposi-tion, in the labor that are manifestedamong the sons of men--from thecreation of the world till to-day--that this is the work of God. Thevarious persecutions, the efforts whichhave been manifested against the orga-nization of this Church and kingdomfor its overthrow and destruction,should show--and have shown to hea-ven and earth--that there is a poweron earth outside the power of man.We have no power in ourselves.We never have had in the guidanceand direction of this kingdom, onlythrough the interposition of AlmightyGod. I have never read anywhere,that I know of, of the same powermanifested in any dispensation tothe children of men, which was mani-fested to the Prophet of God in theorganization of this Church, whenthe Father and the Son both appearedto the Prophet Joseph in answer tohis prayer, and when the Father said,"This is my Beloved Son; beholdHim; hear ye Him." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] This was animportant revelation, which has neverbeen manifested in the same mannerin any dispensation of the world, thatGod has given concerning His work.So in its organization, the Prophet ofGod was administered to by theangels of heaven. They were histeachers, they were his instructors,and all that he did, and all that heperformed from the commencement,from that day to the day of his mar-tyrdom, was by the revelation ofJesus Christ. We ought to under-stand this, and, as a people, havefaith in God, in His revelations, inHis promises. We should look forthfor the fulfilment of these pro-mises unto us in the day and genera-tion in which we live. They will befulfilled. The Lord is at work. Hehas set His hand to accomplish thegreat dispensation of which all thepatriarchs and prophets have spokensince the world began. Therefore letnot your hearts be troubled; believein God, believe in Jesus Christ, be-lieve in the Gospel which has beenpreached unto us, and keep and ful-fill the commandments of God; thenall will be right. The Lord will notfail the Latter-day Saints; He willnot fail in His work, in the gatheringof His people; He will not fail theseed of Abraham; He will not fail theseed of Judah. They will be gatheredhome to Jerusalem, their holy place.They will receive their city and Tem-ple, and be prepared for the comingof their King.Zion will arise and prosper. Ifthe Latter-day Saints will but do theirduty, there is nothing in the way ofour accomplishing all that has been 
 till about two days before his death.Well, we mourn his loss. We feel hisloss. All those associated with himdo. We feel the loss of men occupy-ing such positions as he has done.His position has been very responsible.He has magnified it unto the end.Now, when Brother Wells' spirit lefthis body, what was his condition?Well, I have my faith and my viewswith regard to it. When his spiritleft his body he met with a corps offriends ready to receive him--thosefriends with whom he has dwelt, withwhom he has toiled in building up theChurch and Kingdom of God on theearth. There is rejoicing when thespirit of a Saint of the Living Godenters into the spirit world and meetswith the Saints who have gone beforehim.Brethren and sisters, we are not herein the flesh upon uncertainty. Weare here upon a mission. We havebeen kept in the spirit world until theday and generation in which we live,and we have been called forth to taber-nacle here in the flesh. We have heardthe Gospel. We have believed it. Wehave received it. We have receivedthe ordinances thereof. We have atestimony before high heaven of thetruths of these eternal principles. Allthe unbelief of wicked men or devils onthe face of the earth cannot take thesethings from our hearts. We knowthey are true by the revelations of Godand by the inspiration of the Almighty,through the Holy Ghost, the Com-forter. Therefore, we have a greatdeal to encourage us and to comfort us.Of course, the family of Brother Wells--his wives, his sons and his daughters,his relatives--all feel his loss. Butwhen we contemplate and look forwardto the future, and realize the day is notfar distant when Jesus Christ himselfwill come in the clouds of heaven toreward every man according to thedeeds done in the body, then will comeforth the resurrection of the just, andthis man whose tabernacle is heretoday will come forth out of his grave,his body will become immortal, and hewill stand in the midst of theGods--in the midst of God the Father,God the Son, and all the righteous andholy beings who have kept the samelaw, no matter what age of the worldthey may have lived in. Then willcome forth the reward that the veilhides from your faces and mine today--the reward of those men and womenwho have entered into covenant withthe Lord, and who have received theGospel of Jesus Christ.Brother Wells is happy. He wouldnot come back here if he had theprivilege. He has lived to a good oldage, and has gone down into the gravelike a shock of corn fully ripe, andwith the harness upon him. He andPresident Young were about the sameage at death. Well, we feel manytimes as we did in the days of Joseph.The Church felt then as though theycould not live without him. But thesethings are in the hand of God.I would say to the family and to thefriends of Brother Wells, let yourhearts be comforted. All is right.Brother Wells has as much power towork and labor for your interest6the other side of the veil as he hasbeen able to do here. He has performeda work here for the living and for thedead. He has gone to the other side ofthe veil to receive his reward. So Isay to the Latter-day Saints, let us betrue and faithful to God and our cov-enants. We are here upon a mission.Some are taken; some are left. I havenever seen a year that I know of inthis Church when there have been asmany aged men called away, many ofthem suddenly, as in the year that haspassed and gone. Of course it only re-mains for those of us who are left totry to do our duty the remaining daysthat we have to spend here. But Iwant to say to all the Latter-daySaints, have no fears with regard tothe Kingdom of God, nor the Churchof Christ, nor the work of God. It istrue. Zion is true. The dispensationis true. The Holy Priesthood is true.Therefore, let us be true in our labors,and labor while the day lasts; keep thecommandments of God, and prepare our-selves for that which is to come. Ourbrethren are busy on the other side ofthe veil, and they have a work to do toprepare themselves for the coming ofthe Son of Man. All men who go into thespirit world, and who bear the HolyPriesthood, will continue their labors.Their works will follow them. Theirwork will not cease when they laytheir tabernacles down here in thetomb. Their spirits in the spirit worldmingle with those whom it is theirright and privilege to mingle with, andthe work will continue. Therefore, Isay to the family and to the Latter-daySaints, God bless you all. Let us betrue. Let us be faithful. Let us keepthe commandments of God. Let uslabor while the day lasts, for soon nightmay come when no man can work.My brethren that follow me will oc-cupy the time to enter into these thingsmore fully with regard to BrotherWells, as they shall be led by the HolySpirit. I felt I could not do justice tomy feelings without making a few re-marks upon this occasion; but I do notfeel to spend a great deal of time intalking to the Latter-day Saints. I askGod my Heavenly Father to bless you--to bless the family, bless the Eldersof Israel, bless the Apostles, and all thequorums and Saints. As I said before,let us be true to our covenants, true toGod and true to the work weare engaged in; for we ourselveswill soon be called home, to fol-low in the same path; our bodies willbe laid in the tomb, as Brother Wellsis going to be today, and we will getthrough with our mission unto whichwe have been sent here. I thank Godfor the Gospel. I thank God for thelight of heaven, and for the truths ofeternal life which have been revealedfrom heaven for the exaltation, gloryand salvation of the children of men.I pray God, my Heavenly Father, thatHis blessings may attend us, that wemay be sustained until we get throughwith our labor in the flesh, that wemay inherit eternal life; for Jesus' sake.Amen. 
 this valley in 1847, they found it a bar-ren desert, without a single mark ofthe Anglo Saxon race. The Latter-day Saints upon their arrival here setto work and did the best they could tochange its condition. They plowed,planted and watered the ground, builtcabins and other habitations, and sowent on until that Tabernacle, theTemple adjoining it, and three othertemples were reared in the midst ofthe people. It had taken millions ofdollars to rear these holy places, and,he asked, who had to do it? Why theleaders and Elders in Israel--the Lat-ter-day Saints, the Relief Societiesand the women of Zion; all had con-tributed of their substance which Godhad given them. Did they call upontheir enemies -- those who wereopposed to them and seeking theirdestruction to help them in theirwork? No, and they would not haveresponded if they had. Was it wrong forthe Latter-day Saints to engage inthese things? It was not; they couldnot carry out the purposes of AlmightyGod unless they did.He would say before the Lord thathe believed in his heart there was notone among the Presidency of thisChurch, or among the twelve Apostles,but who, if required to do so, would laydown his life willingly for the Gospel'ssake. Moreover, there were thousandsamong this people who would be readyto do the same. Of course, we shouldnot set our hearts upon the things ofthis world, nor suffer them to turn usfrom our duties.With regard to their positiontemporally, their history wasbefore the whole world. The UnitedStates government required theirproperty--what was called Churchproperty--and receivers were appointedto take it. They delivered it up tothem, according to their demands, andproperty that had already been soldand the proceeds of the sales used forthe benefit of the people had been in-cluded in the seizure.He thought there was no particularharm in his naming this. Presi-dent Taylor delivered into thehands of the various Bishopsthroughout this territory a cer-tain quantity of wheat and othergrain as trustee-in-trust. It amountedto considerable; but all this with theother property was required at theirhands. The authorities went to workand had to give their notes to theamount of about $300,000 in order tosatisfy the government. They stilltrusted in God; but it took some moneyto discharge the demands made uponthem. They had to borrow somemoney to meet those notes; and stillthey owed something with regard tothem.President Woodruff alluded to themany thousands of dollars which ithad also been necessary for theChurch to expend in order to help thepeople in some of the settlements, inthe erection of school houses, meetinghouses, to supply the wants of thepoor, etc.What was the cause of this greatgathering of the people? he asked.They heard the Gospel of Christ pro-claimed by His Servants, and believedit. They came to Zion without coun-sel from anybody, because they hadthe spirit of gathering within them,and it was this that had made Utahwhat she was today.Let them be patient, faithful to theircovenants with God, full of charityone towards another, and all would bewell. He counseled them to go for-ward in the good work which they hadbegun, and they would assuredly con-quer and overcome the obstacles whichbeset their path. God would bepleased and soften the hearts of mentowards them; hundreds and thousandswould yet visit Utah, to behold thework of the Latter-day Saints, and seethey were in earnest and meant whatthey said. 
 Can any of these Apostles? Taken aswe have been from the plow, the plane,the hammer, and the various occupationsof life, can we boast we have power todo this? We cannot; we are not madeof that material. The only marvel Ihave had all my life has been that theLord ever chose me for anything, es-pecially as an Apostle and as President.But that is His own business; it was notmine.My name has been referred to two orthree times by the Apostles with regardto my labors. I want to say somethingin relation to that. To begin with, Iwill say that the Lord has never set Hishand in any age of the world, especiallyin ours, to establish a Zion like this,without preparing an element for it. Infact, the Lord never undertook to doanything with regard to this world, ap-pertaining to His kingdom and work,until He had prepared a people for it.Now, the set time had come for the ful-fillment of the revelations of St. John,when another angel should fly throughthe midst of heaven, having the ever-lasting Gospel to preach to them thatdwelt upon the earth, "saying with aloud voice, fear God, and give glory toHim; for the hour of His judgment iscome." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] The time, I say, had come forthe manifestation of the Gospel of Christto the world. The Apostles of Christand every man that bore the Priesthoodin their day and generation were put todeath for the word of God and testimonyof Jesus, and the Holy Priesthood wascaught up to God, and remained thereuntil the day and generation in whichJoseph Smith was raised up. He wasordained to the Aaronic Priesthood byJohn the Baptist, who held the keys ofthat Priesthood while dwelling in theflesh. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] He was ordained to the Apostle-ship by Peter, James and John, whoheld the keys of that Priesthood whenthey were taken from the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] Thatwas the beginning of this work. TheLord could not undertake a work ofthis kind without there was a way and apeople prepared for it. In the firstplace, the Lord prepared the minds ofmen of the generation in which JosephSmith was born, that they might beready to receive His work when it wasestablished. There were men that werekept in the spirit world thousands ofyears to stand in the flesh in this genera-tion to bear this Holy Priesthood and tobear record of that to the inhabitants ofthe earth. Those men have been bornin this day, and they have been movedupon to prepare for this work.Now, I desire to say something aboutmyself. It is generally considered egot-ism for a man to speak of himself; but Ispeak of my history and experience be-cause it is applicable to thousands ofothers. Eighty years ago, when I wasabout eight years old, I attended Sab-bath school under Dr. Porter, a greatreverend divine in Farmington, Con-necticut. There I read some strangethings in the New Testament. Whatwere they? Why, I read of Apostles; Iread of men who laid hands on the sick,and they recovered; who cast out devils,raised the dead, caused the dumb tospeak, the blind to see, the lame to leap,who held converse with God and withholy angels, and had visions and reve-lations. Brethren and sisters, I read ofthese things when I was eight years ofage. They made an impression uponmy mind as soon as I read them. "Whyis it, Dr. Porter,—why is it, Dr. Haws,—why is it, gentlemen, that you do notadvocate in your day and generationthat faith once delivered to the Saints?Why don't you receive these things, ifthey were the servants of God and hadthe Gospel?" "Oh!" said they, "thesethings are all done away with. Theywere given in the dark ages of theworld to convince the world that Jesuswas the Christ. We live in the blaze ofthe glorious gospel light of Christ; wedo not need them today." "Then,"said I, "give me the dark ages of theworld, if they will give a man power tounlock the door of eternity and holdconverse with God, and receive theseblessings and gifts manifest in that day."From that time my inspiration began.As soon as I grew a little older I beganto read the revelations. My soul wasdrawn out upon these things. In myearly manhood I prayed day and nightthat I might live to see a prophet. Iwould have gone a thousand miles tohave seen a prophet, or a man that couldteach me the things that I read of inthe Bible. I could not join any church,because I could not find any church atthat time that advocated these principles.I spent many a midnight hour, by theriver side, in the mountains, and in mymill (being a miller,) calling upon Godthat I might live to see a prophet orsome man that would teach me of thethings of the kingdom of God as I readthem. I remained in that condition un-til the year 1833. I was living with mybrother on the shores of Lake Ontario.A man by the name of Zera Pulsipher,sixty miles from where I lived, wasmoved upon in the month of December,with the snow three or four feet deep, toarise and go to the north, the Lord hadsome work for him there. He calledupon another man to go with him. Theytraveled two days on the road to thenorth, not knowing where they weregoing. Our house was the first placethat they stopped at. I was lumberingat the time on the shore of the lake.Zera Pulsipher told my brother's wifewho they were and what they were, andwhat their principles were. He said theLord had sent him into the north coun-try to do some work there. My sister-in-law told him that her husband andmyself both believed in the principlesthat he taught. Well they held a meet-ing. I went to it, and for the first timein my life I heard a Gospel sermon. Iinvited the men home. I borrowed aBook of Mormon, and sat up all nightand read it, and I had a testimony it wastrue. In the morning I asked to bebaptized. Myself and brother werebaptized—the first in that region of coun-try. From that hour till this I neverhave had one moment's doubt with re-gard to the truth of the Gospel of JesusChrist. I know the work is true. I havebeen called into the vineyard and minis-try with the rest of my brethren, and Ihave traveled a great many miles andquite a number of years. I have heldthe Apostleship fifty-eight years. Bro-ther Joseph only held it some fourteenbefore he was slain. Brother Brighamheld it about forty, and Brother Taylorabout the same length of time as my-self. I have labored all these years andI know it is the work of God. I knowthe Lord is with this people. I have adesire that we may magnify our callingsand fulfill our position upon the earth.God has organized this Church; He hasorganized it with prophets, apostles,pastors, teacher, helps, etc., in fulfill-ment of the promises of God in the lastdays. I traveled with Joseph Smithquite a length of time. I traveled withBrigham Young forty years, at home andabroad. I traveled with him to thiscountry. We came with the pioneers.Brigham Young, though he never wrotemany revelations, had the revelations ofGod with him from the day that he em-braced this work till the day of hisdeath. I have often thought of the timewhen he was asked if he would not goon to California instead of stopping inthis barren land. What was his ans-wer? I was with him when he gavethat answer. He said, "No, I am goingto stay right here. I am going to builda temple here; I am going to build a cityhere; I am going to build a countryhere." Has it not been so? Yes, it has.Was it not by revelation? Certainly itwas. We have all been called from thislow position in life to the Priesthood.Thousands of this people have beencalled to go abroad to preach the Gos-pel. In speaking of myself and themanner I was led, so we find it every-where throughout the world. Wheredid you come from? You came fromevery state in the Union; from England,Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany,France, Ireland and other parts ofEurope, as well as from the differentnations of the earth and the islands ofthe sea. One of these simple Elderscame to you and you heard him preachthe Gospel, and he promised you if youwould repent of your sins and be bap-tized for the remission of them, youshould receive the gift of the HolyGhost. Did you not receive it? Youdid, or you would not be here today.Nobody could then keep you at home.We have been gathered together by thecommandments of God, and so far weare trying to do the will of God. Butwe have only just begun. I was at theconcert here last night, and I could nothelp but think that if President Younghad been there and looked upon thatvast assembly of ten thousand people,gathered not only from this territory butfrom neighboring states and territories,he would have felt satisfied. When hebuilt this Tabernacle we did not havepeople to fill it; but he told us that inthe building up of Zion we would neverhave a house big enough to accommo-date us however large we might buildit; and so it proved last night. I enjoyedthe concert. Governor Thomas invitedme to address the assembly; but I feltthat people had gathered there, not tohear preaching, but music.Let me speak a little further with re-gard to the Lord preparing a people forthis work. The history of this wholepeople is in that line. I will refer youto the year 1840. The Lord gave acommandment for the Twelve Apostlesto go to England. There had a fewgone to England before; Brother Kim-ball and several others went in 1837 andestablished the Church there. But in1840 the Apostles were called as a bodyto go there; and the devil did not like it.He tried to kill us all. There washardly one of the Twelve Apostles whowent that was well. When I left homePresident Young paddled me across theMississippi in a canoe, and I was suffer-ing with the chills and fever. I hadspent two years in Tennessee and Ken-tucky, in the midst of sickness; but Inever had an attack of chills and feverin my life till I was called to go to Eng-land. It was so with most all of us. Thedevil did not like it; but we went. Itwas the harvest time then in that land.We accomplished a great work. We

 his people, and will have mercy uponhis afflicted."But Zion said, The Lord hath for-saken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me."Can a woman forget her suckingchild, that she should not have com-passion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee."Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are con-tinually before me."Those things that have been predict-ed from the beginning concerning thewinding up scene and the second com-ing of the Son of Man will come to pass. Therefore, let us prepare for them.I bear my testimony of these things; for I do not know how long I shall havethis privilege on the earth. In my boyhood I attended the Sabbath school under old Dr. Porter, one of the pillars of the Presbyterian church in New England. I read the New Testa-ment there; I read of Christ and ofthe Apostles; I read of the miracles and the gifts. I asked Dr. Porter why they did not have those things in their midst. "Why do you not have that faith once delivered to the Saints? Why do you not have Prophets and Apostles now?" The doctor smiled and said, "My boy, those things are done away." I knew they were done away; but why were they done away? He said, "They were given in the dark ages of the world, to convince the in-habitants of the earth that Jesus was the Christ. We live today in the blaze of the glorious Gospel light of Christ, and do not need these things." Then, said I to him and to others, "Give me the dark ages of the world instead of this glorious Gospel blaze, if in those dark ages there was power to unlock the heavens and give you converse with God and angels, and give you gifts and graces and power." Yes, in my boy-hood I would have gone a thousandmiles to have seen a Prophet. I had adesire to see one. I hoped to live to see one. I have lived to mingle withProphets and Apostles for a long peri-od. From 1833 to this day I have neverseen anything but truth in connection with this work.Let us try to do our duty and mag-nify our calling before high heaven; for it will pay us. When I die I wantthe privilege of being raised from thedead, and of mingling with God, with Christ, and with Apostles and Proph-ets, and the privilege of having my family, my father and mother, mybrothers and sisters, with me in the celestial kingdom of God, organized in a family capacity, that we may dwell together there.  Salvation is worth some-thing, no matter whether it is popularor unpopular, despised or not despised; and if we ever get it, we will get it by keeping the commandments of God and carrying out these principles that God has revealed to us. I have traveled with the Prophets and Apostles, and seen the persecutions, and been through some of the trials and tribulations. We have been led here, and we will tryto build up Zion here. This Tabernacleand these temples the old Prophet Isaiah and other Prophets saw. Weare here in fulfillment of prophecy, andwe are doing all the good we can. Whyshould man quarrel with his neighborabout religion? Every man has a right to his religion, whether it will save him or not. I never quarreled with any man about religion; never con-sidered it proper to do so. Inever felt like debating withany man upon the subject of religion for the sake of gaining power over him in debate. I do not believe in it.I teach what good I can, and when I get through with this world I hope I will be satisfied with it. We havegathered here from all nations. I bap-tized many in England that have gath-ered here, though most of them havepassed away, where I shall go myself before long.I pray God to bless you and to guide and direct us all, as Apostles, asProphets, as Elders, as Saints, asfathers and mothers, and as children. Only reflect a moment on the blessing that God has given you in having theprivilege of going into these temples and working for our dead friends. Wehave four temples, one standing on this block. Brigham Young directed in thebuilding of them, and he has gone home to glory, immortality and eternal life. I pray God that we may have powerto do our duty, magnify our calling, walk uprightly before the Lord, and acknowledge the hand of God in all theblessings bestowed upon us. This is my prayer and desire in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 baptized about seven thousand that year,opened doors throughout England andand Scotland, and laid a foundation forthe work which has been fulfilled up tothe present time. I will refer to onecircumstance connected with that mis-sion. I was in the potteries in Stafford-shire, having gone there when I got toEngland. I was doing a good workthere, baptizing almost every night.One night I went to Hanley to hold ameeting, and there was a very fullhouse. Before I got up to speak, theSpirit of God came upon me and toldme that that was the last meeting Ishould hold with that people for manydays. I had appointments out for twoweeks in that region of the country.After I got through preaching that night,I told them it was the last meeting Ishould hold with them. I went downinto the water and baptized quite anumber, and in the morning I went be-fore the Lord and asked what Hewanted of me. He told me to go tothe south. I got into the stage androde eighty miles south. I went intoHerefordshire, and the first man's houseI stopped at was John Benbow's. Inone hour after I arrived at his house Ilearned why the Lord had sent me there.I name this because it is in the line ofwhat I was speaking of. Here I founda company of men and women, somesix hundred, who had banded togetherunder the name of United Brethren, andwere laboring for the ancient order ofthings. They wanted the Gospel astaught by the prophets and apostles, asI did in my youth. Well, without dwell-ing upon this, I will say that the firstthirty days after I arrived in Hereford-shire I baptized forty-five preachers andseveral hundred members, and I had inmy hands all the chapels or houseslicensed for worship according to law.We brought in two thousand in abouteight months' labor. Many of thesepeople had been looking and prayingfor this very work, and they were pray-ing for it when I went there. I took nohonor to myself with regard to this mat-ter, I never felt that I could. All wehave to do is to follow the dictation ofthe Spirit of the Lord, and give God thehonor and the glory of it. We did agood work there and God blessed us.From there we went to London.Brothers Heber C. Kimball and GeorgeA. Smith and myself preached and es-tablished the first branch of the Churchin the city of London. I rejoiced verymuch in my labors in Herefordshire,Gloucestershiae and Worcestershire,and thousands of those that were bap-tized there are in Utah. We had quitea number of Bishops in this Territorythat I baptized at that time. Theyoungest I baptized there was BrotherRowberry, who was a bishop of Tooele.He was only a boy at that time.I want to refer to one circumstancethat took place while in that missionand I do it as an example of the Lord'sdealings with us in matter pertaining totemporal matters. John Benbow was anoble man. He was like an Englishlord; as rich a man, I suppose as evercame into the Church. He had notbeen baptized a month, I do not think,when he came into a little sitting roomwith his wife, and he probably spentthree quarters of an hour in telling methat he had been reading in the NewTestament how in the days of theApostles they sold all their possessionsand laid them at the Apostles' feet [##Acts 4:34-35##], andhe said he felt it was his duty to fulfillthat law and he wanted to do it. Ilistened to him patiently and when he gotthrough it took perhaps half an hourto tell him the difference between our po-sition today and the position of theApostles in that day. I gave him to under-stand that God had not sent me to England to take care of his gold, his horses, hiscows and his property; He had sent methere to preach the Gospel. I told him,however, that the Lord would accept ofhis sacrifice, and that whenever hecould do good, he should do it; heshould assist the poor, help publish theBook of Mormon, etc. Now, whatwould have been the result if I hadtaken the other course, and said, "Yesgive me your property and I will takecare of it?" Why, he would probablyhave apostatized. Not only that, butthere would have been one foolishApostle, who would have been a suitablecandidate for apostasy also. But wasthat any temptation to me? No, it wasnot. It would not have been to anyElder who had enough of the Spirit ofGod to know the difference between ahundred thousand pounds of moneyand a part in the first resurrection, withpower to pass by the angels and thegods to exaltation and glory, and standin the presence of God and the Lambforever and forever.I name these things to show that therewas a people prepared for this work.Go where you would and you would findspirits of this kind. That is why thispeople have come up here from thevarious nations of the earth. We havethe Gospel of Christ abroad in allnations today as far as we have oppor-tunity, and we have got to continuethis work. The Lord is going to cutHis work short in righteousness [##Romans 9:28##]; and asI have said before, however insignificantthis people may be in the eyes of theworld, the God of heaven holds us re-sponsible for preaching this Gospel toevery nation under heaven, and we haveit to do or we will be damned. Wecannot avoid this. Why? Because, asPaul says, "Woe is unto me, if I preachnot the Gospel." [##1 Corinthians 9:16##] There is but oneGospel; never has been but one, andnever will be; and Paul says, "Butthough we, or an angel from heavenpreach any other Gospel unto you thanthat which we have preached unto you,let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] That Gospel, yesaints of the living God, and the world,is in our hands, sent to us by the minis-trations of Angels—the same Gospel thatwas taught from Adam to Christ, andfrom Christ down to our day and gener-ation, when God has had a people onthe earth. I have a great desire myselffor the welfare of the Latter-day Saints.We have a great work to perform.Before I close, I want to say a fewwords to the Apostles and to theSaints of God. I want to say somethingabout the devil. The devil, in the days of the Savior, got one Apostle to denyhis Lord and sell Him for thirty piecesof silver. But when Judas' eyes wereopened to see what he had done, hedid not prize those thirty pieces ofsilver, but went out and hung himself.Is that devil dead? Has Lucifer, the sonof the morning, gone out of existence?No; he is here today. He is in themidst of this people; and if there are anypeople under heaven that Lucifer withall the fallen angels that dwell on theearth are laboring to destroy, they arethese Latter-day Saints. It was so an-ciently; it will be so until He who holdsthe keys of death and hell shall bindSatan and shut him up. Until that hourhe will labor for our destruction. Iwant to say to these Apostles that I haveseen days of trouble with the quorum ofthe Twelve. I have referred many timesto the days in Kirtland, and my hearthas had a great deal of pain over thoseaffairs. There the devil labored withthe Apostles and caused a goodshare of them to apostatize. One halfof them apostatized, and some of theothers came pretty near it. The signersor witnesses to the Book of Mormon—Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer andMartin Harris—all apostatized from theChurch of Jesus Christ, though theynever denied the Book of Mormon. Inthe darkest day, neither one of themever denied that, but always maintainedit to the day of his death. But I wantto say to my brethren that if the devilcould get one of these Apostles—yes,one of them—to believe that the Presi-dency of this Church were workingagainst him, and that we did not havehis welfare at heart, or if he could get aSeventy or any man in this Church tobelieve it, he would labor to do so. Ifthe devil could have got the Savior tohave followed him, he would have over-thrown the whole plan of salvation.But he did not do it. Jesus said, "Getthe behind me, Satan: for it is written,Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,and Him only shalt thou serve." [##Luke 4:8##] So Isay to these Apostles before me, if thedevil could make one of you believe thatwe would not give you right counsel, hewould do it. But he will not do it. Ithank God for that. I feel I can prophesythat before God and angels. The Apos-tles, as a body, are united, and God haslaid His Spirit upon them, and they willbe true and faithful to this work untilthey get through with it. Those are myfeelings. I rejoice in this. I trust Ishall never pass through any more ofthose scenes that I witnessed in thedays that are past and gone.Brethren and sisters, God bless you.Now, do not be afraid that the Presi-dency and Apostles of this Church willgive you any wrong counsel. We havelearned better than to do that. Weshall never do it while we dwell in theflesh. The salvation of the sons of menis of far more worth than all the honorthat the human family can give uponour heads. Give me salvation; give mea part in the first resurrection; give methe privilege of standing in the morningof the first resurrection with theresurrected dead—with my father'shouse and with the prophets and apos-tles who have lived in my day andgeneration; give me power to be exaltedwith them in the eternal worlds in thekingdom of our God. That is all I ask.And it is my privilege and yours. It isthe privilege of this people to receivethese blessings at the hands of God. Ihave confidence in my brethren. I re-joice with them in the union that dwellstoday in the house of Israel, and withthe Presidency and Twelve Apostles.We love one another. We understandsomething of the work of God in ourday and time. We have labored to-gether. Here are my counselors; theyhave spent years and years upon theislands of the sea, where they have hadto live upon cocoanuts and poi and foodof that character, and they did it to savethe souls of men. God has blessed themin all their labors. He will bless them.He will bless this people.I believe this is all I want to say toyou this morning. I felt sick when I 
 promised unto us. I have no fearsmyself with regard to the outcomeand final triumph of the kingdom ofGod, of the Zion of God, of the Churchof God, of the Saints of God. TheLord has already gathered many thou-sands to these valleys of the moun-tains, in fulfillment of His promises.Now, brethren and sisters, let usbe thoughtful while in the flesh, andseek to magnify our calling. Let ourhearts be set on the building up ofthe kingdom of God, and none shallfail. With regard to those who mayaddress us during this Conference, Ihope that they may all have ourprayers, that they may be inspiredby the Spirit of God, and preach onlythose things which are true and faith-ful.May God bless us and pour out HisSpirit upon us, that we may have agood time at this Conference. Maywe enjoy that Spirit, may our heartsbe united together, and may we re-joice in those principles which havebeen revealed for the comfort, salva-tion, and eternal life of the childrenof men.
