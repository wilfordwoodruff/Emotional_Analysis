Bro. Jacobs is a good man and a willing worker in the kingdom, and we wrote you some time ago asking permission to use him as bishops counsellor,  but we made another selection instead. But we now feel to present his condition to you as stated above, so if you should feel to release him  it might be done before he arranged his business during his absense, or disposed of some property to help cary him to his field of labor, that he would not other-wise dispose of trusting you will pardon these suggestions, we remain your brethren in the gospel   Hans M.

We sat down to the tables at 5:30 PM and after partaking heartily of the good things so tastefuly prepared by an efficient committee composed of local pretheren and sisters, we repared to a lower room where the intellectual feast consis- ting of addresses, songs, recitations &amp;c ENDENTRY      Staffordshire Eng Oct 13 1884     satisfaction that I reply to your very excelent letter of the 22 the honest truth I hardly know what to write about.

After leaving the place where I last addressd you (on the 6 I wanderd into Derbyshire to a town rejoicing under the appellation of Glossop arriving there about five oclock and finding an open market in the centre of the town with a very inviting appearance for a meeting I determined to hold one though afoot &amp; alone.

There are a very few Saints in this distr- ict and very poor ones at that with  one or two exceptions. A great many  of the Saints in this country are so weak in the faith that it takes one man on ea side of them with an umberella to keep them in the church now that they are in, and we have to guard every action and wor for fear of offending some of them, but they are not at all particular what kind of language they use to us; but I am like the Drummer that gets kicked down stairs and  has doors slamed in his face, I never get insulted.

After the exercises were over, games of a sociable char- acter were indulged ^in^ by the local Saints; we Elders however did not take part in them for obvious reasons, but taking it all togather we had a very enjoyable time. I went  through the Manchester Art Gallery a few days ago where several thou- sand specimens are on exhibitions nearly all the leading artists in the country are there represented. The finest picture of the collection in my estimation is one called "Dantes Dream," it measures about 12 x 14 ft and is valued at $5,000.

But if ever gross darknes coverd the minds of any people, they are to be found here in England, and if  there are any people on the face of the wilde earth who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, they are here in England. And yet I do not think they are one whit worse if as bad as in other lands. Well to return. At about 6-30 I repaired to the market and ENDENTRY  went without a good long purse. Of course I believe if an Elder is in a tight place the Lord will provide for him, in fact He has provided for me although I had plenty of money in my pocket. Ask W what he thinks of the British mission to day and what it cost him. I think I am perfectly safe in saying that I have spent as little as any one in the field. I never ride only when I am compelled to through force of circumstances for I would just as soon walk  beautiful scenery as not. I would not be  a Woodruff if I would not. No Father I have not spent $20.00 a month nor $5 I have plenty money for a long time, yet with care, and I was greatly surprized when I rec'd the draft, but I can take care of it for future need.

It was laughable to see five or six big fellows rolled against the side and after befor they could regain their feet back to the other; but we took it all in good part &amp; as the captain said the stronger the wind blew, the biger noise the bay made.

W. leaves me to travle alone in the  Leek district for the present at any rate, but I dont mind it so much because there are some places where the people are so poor that they are scarcely able to accomodate two but that can get along with all very nicely, so we see as the old say- ing goes there is no great lo without some small gain.

Was glad to heare you are well with the exception of a cold which I trust will soon leave. You seem to have had several quite exciting episods in your travels north. Am glad to hear of the marriage of Bro Hyde Park. I was afraid Matt would go off tlo Calcutta without getting himself a matrimonial mate and am therefore somewhat surprized to hear to the contra of two other couples the bridegrooms are two of Pres Taylors Sons and the brides are misss Colebrook, was acquainted with all the party and wish them much joy on thier journey in the matrimonal car. We are at present in Audley a small town in Staffordshire about 35 miles south of Mancheter I will give you a little account of my labors for the past ten days At our last fast ENDENTRY  fuly oppressive influence, this feeling seemed to increase more &amp; more &amp; when I was speaking the ground under my feet seemed to rise &amp; fall and around us there was a wall of thin bluish vapor quite perceptible. I did not mention my feelings to my companion until after the meeting for fear he would think I was getting the blues; but on acquainting him with my feelings I found that he was undergoing a similar experiance. I am satisfied it was the two powers of light &amp; darkness striving for the supremacy that caused sutch a feeling at our meeting; as soon as we left the place on the following morning the feeling left us. That place is the Devels own stronghold &amp; he &amp; his imps have full possession. We are going there again this week, and I hope I shall not have the same experiance for it is a terrible feeling. On the fourth of July all of us elders in this confrence &amp; elders Pratt &amp; Colonel  Shaw the American minister to England he entertained us very courteously for a short ENDENTRY       Portsmouth     written from Bunkerville came to hand a number of days since, but I have not had a fitting opportunity of replying to it untill now. I wrote you on Feb 23 and addressed as advised to Jas G Bleak etc. also on Feb 28 which I sent to Bunkerville both of which I trust you have received before now. Your last letter was quite as welcome as its predecessor and I was pleased to learn that your health was so good as I feared your health would be impared by the continual hardships necessarily attending you ^present^ career. Judging from the large number of your correspondents I should imagine that you would find a plenty to occupy your leisure moments. I returned yeasterday from Southampton ENDENTRY  was being taken to Salt Lake against her will had ben rescued from the clutches of the horrible Mormons and placed under the protecting care of kind friends. Of course this report and &amp; will go the round of the press and be gobbled up as a dainty morsel by those who love a lie, and will be the means of deceiving many an honest souls. It was quite a lengthy article and would be easily palmed of a credulous bublic public as the truth. They will be more apt to believe it from the fact that a girl of the same name (Coop) did actu aly go from Stockport with the last company but one. I was acquainted with "her myself. I am still traveling alone but am going into Manchester to morrow to our council meeting, on Thursday and may have a change next month but it makes no difference to me which way it is. I went the other evening to ENDENTRY     sent £10   Winchester Hants.      to night after a walk of eighteen miles. I thought I would start a letter to you to night and finish it in the morning all being well. Elder Denney and myself left Southhampton this morning and walked to Ramsey and called at the residence of a M Lord Mount Temple's estate but found the lady had gone to visite some friends. She has ben lately inves- tigating the principles of truth, and Bro D. informs me that she is quite favorabely impressed, but what the ENDENTRY    to day to hold meeting in the openair, we keep preaching away but it does not seem to result in much good. It may be like bread cast upon the water which will come forth at some future day. I saw old dad Worthingtons Widow &amp; daughter the other day; he used to live next to Wagstaff in Johnsons old place just mention it to mother shee will remember him: the old lady say she has just recieved inteligence of his death about one month ago; she does not know that he married again and I dident till her for it would only make her feel bad; It seems he was the only  one in the church of his family &amp; this accounts for his leaving his family here Bro Briggs showed me around yeasterd- ay throught the markets &amp; buisines part of town, the fish market was the greatest sight I ever saw in my life.

Your welcome letter bearing date Nov 20 hand and was read with interest also one of Dec 5 -usly awaiting the arrival of the  photographs. I sent a package of  cards to Mother which I hope arrived safely. I feel all broke up this morning  in a manner of speaking. To much  holliday do with me no as well as it used to do.  On Christmas eve I went out with  the Manchester Saints on a serren -ading tour of the city, and did not  get in till 9 oclock Christmas morning ENDENTRY  long as they are amight to keep me. I feel to praize God every day of my life for this experiance which well be of lasting bennefit to me. I am sincerely thankful that from my earliest recolection I have ben taught the way of life, and when I look on my past life and see what some of it has ben and remember how neare I  have ben on more than one occa- sion, to the brink of ruin it fairly makes me shudder, and It seems that there must have ben some power to prevent my rushing headlong into the dark abyss below. I prize my mission much and ENDENTRY     Portsmouth      letter of  return from Southampton and I now essay to write a few lines in reply in compliance with your request as well as to gratify the inclinations of my own heart. I wrote you quite a long letter last Monday from Winchester and directed as instructed to Jas G Bleak which I hope you will get all right. I also wrote to you on  of February. It grieves me very much to hear of the outragous conduct of the officers of the law in the Territories and way in which the leading men are hunted and hounded as if they were the worst violators of the law instead of the peacab^le^ ENDENTRY  district to labor with bro Allen in the Leek district, this a large district being comprized in four shires vis Staffordshire Derbyshire there are but few saints and they are poor &amp; scatterd but most of them do their best to make us comfortable. We occasionaly have a midnight encounter with an army of flees and other varmine which sometimes lastsy until daylight when we can retreat leaving them in possession of the field. but we are  getting used to them so they dont bother us a great deal Elder Allen is a young man from Mount Pleasant of my own age and is verry zealous in the cause of truth. I like him verry much for a companion. After hav President both by example and precept to stir the country up with some out door preaching, we started out on the morning of the eleventh intending to do so if the Lord was willing, we walked 20 miles to a town called Macclesfield, on our arrival we found a large multitude gatherd on ENDENTRY  from us in a religious point of view still he must do us justice to say that the american government was greatly indebted to our people for the work they have done in redeeming Utah from her sterility and making her the beautiful garden that she is to day, we drank with lemonade the health of the stars &amp; stripes, on our leaving he gave us an invitation to call on him at any time we chose to do so &amp; he would endeavor to make it pleasant for us, he furnished us with a guide to the new free trade hall &amp; St. James' hall, also visited the Town Hall said to be one of the finest in all Europe we ascended the tower to a distance of one hundred and eighty six feet from the ground where we gained &amp; excelent view of the city stretching away as far as the eye could reach in every direction, the bell which is next in size to  eight tons &amp; two cwt the hammer alone weighs four cwt, the dials outside the tower are  16 ft in diamiter the minute hand moves over a space of 9 in every minute there are twenty chime ENDENTRY  Asahel        at my leaisure I take pleasure in addressing these lines to you, hoping they will find you and the family  in the enjoyment of good health. I  wrote to you and Mother on the receipt of your last letters on the 13 inst I think. Have not heard from any of you since but I expect there is some mail in Manchester for me. I will be there on the 31 there is any. I am very anxious to get the last papers to see the names of those who have ben called on missions and anticipate seeing the names of some of my companions and acquaintances on the list. Presume they will arrive in Liverpool along early in  I have not heard from Henry and Nellie in a long time. I wrote a very long letter to them a few nights ago, suppose they are so buisy is the reason they  do not write. Saw an extract from ENDENTRY  days. While there I succeded in getting one family interested in the Gospel and at the jentlemans request visited his home one evening and spent several hours in conversation with his wife and children; two persons lodging with him were also present they listened attentively and expressed their appreciation of the principles and admitted them to be scriptural The man at whos instance I visited the home I believe to be an honest seeker after truth, and if some unforseen circumstance does not arrise to change his belief in the Gospel, it is my deliberate belief that he will in the near future cast in his good name and fortunes with thos of the much persecuted and missrepr- esented Later-Day Saints. Another man has declared that "he is almost pers- ENDENTRY  and arrainge for the purchase of some old Stars which he has in his poss- ession but he asked sutch an exorb- itant price for them that I decided not to get them.

Dont you think this too high? he also has some of the Seers and Times &amp; Seasons Are they not very scarce at home? Elder Turkey on a mission so I was told this mor- ning by some of the saints and I guess it is true for he was expecting it. I have not seen Pres Williams for two months but expect to on Thursday. My health is good enough to walk thirty two miles in nine hours with only on stop in the entire distance and that  of buttermilk which I ask for at a farm house, so you can see I can still keep a moving thank the Lord. This feat was accomplished a week ago Sunday when ENDENTRY  can tell. Had we have seen M so as to spend the afternoon at her place we would have returned to Southhampton to night, but as things turned out we determined to wend our way to this place and arrived here at 8 oclock and proceded to Bro Elkins. He has a wife and seven children; they are one of those sort of families that have one leg in  the church and one leg outside. And I want to tell you here that Bro Denney informed me on our way here that they had never given the Elders any thing to eat since he has ben in the district, some fifteen ENDENTRY  was enoug for both of our suppers This Week is Whitsuntide a regular galla day for the english people.

The fenian tried yeasterday to blow up the Scotland yards also St James Square in London several people were injured, no clue to the perpetraters of the daring act Father I am thankfull for the kind advice you gave me in your letter and I will try and profit by it for I realise that it is true.

It is very often the case that people look with envy upon those men who act as embassadors for a temporal governments, sutch as the US Minister to I look upon it as a much greater honor to represent  not exchange my station for the thone of England's Queen" There is qute a bitter feeling manifested here betwen the Catholics and Protesta- nts it is amusing as well as significant to hear them impu- gning each other's religon, and waring jaring Christianity is truly a spectacle ENDENTRY  the whistle. We would go to the door and start up a song sometimes singing three or four at one place. Generaly the inmates would invite  us in and prepare some bread &amp; butter with tea cocoa etc, and then after  a few moments rest we were of to the next place. I presume we must have walked between fifteen  and twenty miles. Rather a peculiar way of enjoying ones self was it not? On Christmas I attend a tea party at Burry where I enjoyed myself very well. After the party Pres Williams and I returned to  Manchester where in company with a policeman (one of our members) we enterd some of the slums  of the city where it would have ben dangerous to go alone or without a compitent guide as we were ENDENTRY  and I sometimes wish that while on my mission I could be cut off from all communication with home for there seems to be one trouble after another untill it keeps me in a disturbed stat of mind almost continuely, but I am getting what you might call case-hardened so that all news good or bad makes but little impression on me; and as you say it is better to look on the bright side of everything, and dark indeed must be the mountain that has no bright side to it. This is no doubt a time of trial for the Saints and when the storm of persecution has cleared away the bright beams will reveal to those sturdy saints who still remain on the good ship Zion that some of her weak ones have lost their holds ENDENTRY  for the Salvati (Every one has gone mad over this army here) but as we were more interested in the crowd than the army, we walked into the centre of the square where we  coats &amp; satchels up in a heap and soon the air was ringing with awake! awake the world from sleeping. After singing Elder Allen laid before our auditors the first principles of the gospel in a clear and convincing manner I closed on the apostacy &amp; restoration and bore testimony to the divine mission of the prophet Joseph, we had but one interrup- -tion which was made by a Methodist preacher but it did not ammount to any thing After cloosing we distributed a number of tract which were sought verry eagerly. The 12 walked to  openair service there among our auditors were two ministers, it is verry easy to pick them out of a crowd as they are the  only ones who weare  which they seem to reserve to themselves, on the 13 ENDENTRY  bells weighing thirty tons 18 cwt, the whole works are run by weights four in number weighing respectively 700, 1800, 1900 &amp; 2500 cwt alls suspended by 3/8 in steel wire ropes, the guid gave me permission to take hold of the crank &amp; wind it, it required all my strength to turn it. It takes two hours &amp; a half every day to wind the clock. Father you ask what caused that feeling to come over me when I landed and in reply I will say it was not caused by the remarks of any one, but when I looked upon that vast motly crowd of peopled &amp; almost dispaired of being able to successfuly combat with the flesh, the Wourld &amp; the Devil, but thank the Lord I have succeded so far, and while I am not &amp; never expect to be a florid speaker I can give a fair enun- ciation of the first principles (Dear Father I am proud that you take a kindly interest in one who is near &amp; dear to me for she  is a good girl). Well I dont know that I can add any thing. I am suffering with a cold at present, but think I shall soon get rid of it with love to all, I am your affectionate Son   ENDENTRY  some errors in a former coversa- ation, in the last number of the Star I was much pleased with the last letters which I received from you and Mother, I have read them to nearly all the Saints in my district when gatherd around the fireside at night to let them see what kind of Parents I have, for I think that a letter is the best index to a persons character that we can possibly have; have also read parts of them to a few Strangers, they one and all have expressed ^their^ admiration of them. I suppose you will both pardon this liberty. I do so wish I had some  family portraits with me, they would not only prove a source of comfort to me but serve also to entertain strangers many times. Some strangers who have heard so and bloodcurdling storries as M Paddock and writers of her class have industriously circulated about the ENDENTRY  from past experiance and from the study of humane nature I have learned not to "count my chickens fefore they are hatched" as in several instances people who have ben brought to a position where they could catch a glimpse of the first ^bright^ rays of the Gospel as they struggled through a rift in the clouds of superstition, have gone back again to ^the^ beggarly ellements of the world behind the dense bank of fog where the "Light of Truth" never penetrates. Elder Chas Denney my late companion has ben released to return home with the company of Saints sailing April the 11 gone to London to spend the remainder of his time with his rellatives there so I am left once more to prosecute my labors afoot and alone; but this is to me rather a source of satisfaction ENDENTRY  I walked from Audley in Stafford- shire to Saltney in Wales three miles from Chester where I tarried for two nights under the hospitable roof of a M our church though he was formerly That was the longest Sabath days journey that I remember having taken. For some time I have had a longing desire to pay a visite to  that rare old city of Chester with its many interesting historical asso- ciations and as my favorite mode of locomotion was the cheapest by far I chose it in prefence to all others, and left well repaid for my trouble. The buildings are very quaint and curious; the second story of most of the houses is thrown ENDENTRY  he knew of; well when we got inside I was so ti having had no dinner and the heavy road had given me a ravenous appetite, that I just asked the Lord  to provide us with something to  eat, and it was soon made manif- est that He had heard my simple prayer for the good matron was soon buisy prepareing us some supper, and just as we had finished our frugal meal, another sister came in with a nice pc. of cake which we ate for desert. This last named  sister who is a jenuine L.D.S. but who is out at service and conseq- uently has no place to invite the ENDENTRY  to behold. The Church of England and the Catholic Church have their line layed so close together  that it would appear to the casual oberserver that they were both runing for the same depot; and it looks as if they would soon be annealed together. The Rev C Stirl- ing deliverd a bold address on this subject last evening, in this place. Perhaps a brief synopsis of the same would not be wholy uninteresting to you from the fact that it paints in vivid colors the feeling that ex- ists between Protestant ^notabely the Methodist^ &amp; Catholic. The lecture was deliverd to a large congregation a ^good^ portion of which ENDENTRY  Answered Sept 22 &amp; 23 sent     Manchestre Eng Aug 31 1884     that I address a few times this Sabath  morn. A heavy mist is hanging over the city and a drizzling rain has ben falling all the foor- noon, takeing it all to gather it is a regular English day. This is a queer climate only last Sunday the heat was so oppresive it was almost impossible to get a breath of fresh air, while the past few days it has ben quite chilley making a place near the glowing  hearth the most desirable place when night comes on. I have before me two letters from you  (Father) dated Aug 1 hand yeasterday on my return from Liverp- ool. I have not recieved any letter from you (Mother) since the one dated July 6 answerd immediately. I also wrote you from Farnworth July the 6 not have recieved it.

As we threaded anyway along the dark and narrow Streets Men and Women could be seen reeling to and  frow on nearly every hand. some of the houses were not  fit actualy for  to live in, and more than once during our rambles my mind adverted from this horrible spec- tacle to my comfortable home  We went to bed about two oclock completely wearied with our day's work, for it was little else.

May the Lord help me to keep my grip. I stated in my last letter that I was in need of some means to keep up any kind of a respectable appearance and to procure shelter from the inclemency of the weather and something to eat when hungry; and I am sorry to learn that your finances are at sutch a low ebb, but I am willing to use apart of my savings if necessary, and when I am ready to make a start in life perhaps you can give me a lift as you have done my older brothers, and when once started I will make every exertion to keep the thing arooling. I have always had a desire to help myself so as not to be a burden on my hard-working parents  and you have given me ^every^ encouragement.

On the 17 after bidding the  folks good by where we had ben staying, we were soon on our way for  turnpike to our right and taking a field road we soon found ourselves in a beautiful little valley through which the  following its bank down for some ten miles we passed through some of the most lovely scenery  something about the beuties of English scenery but I doubt if you ever got into as pretty a ENDENTRY  seeing intelligent live "Mormons" from Utah and this surprise is considerably augmented at seeing portraits of pleasa- nt and intelligent women instead of the despondent &amp; inane look that they are accustomed to believe characterizes the female portion of our community. If you have a photograph of yourself or any member of the family to spare I wish you would be kind enough to send them to me. I have enjoyed myself this month pretty well though alone still I have missed the cheering society of bro Allen for he is a wise counselor and a brave champion on the Lords side.

So you see I am much better of alone under the  circumstances. I have received an invitation from the Rev A C Cooper of Tiverton Devonshire to pay him a visite; says that he used to have a chapple at Evanston--I think--and that ^you^ preached in  it on several occasions.
