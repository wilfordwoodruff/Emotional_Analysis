 That Temple was built in the Town of Kirtland Geauga Co Ohio  He received the priesthood in his youth, and He was but a boy  when He went up in Zions Camp for the redemption of zion  in 1834, forty one years before his death, and He has labored   diligently for the building up of the kingdom to the day of his death.

Q. Cannon J. Taylor W   Woodruff & D H Wells [FIGURE] W. Woodruff said I feel   to bear my testimony to what the Apostles Have said to   you I have had vary peculiar feelings for the last 3 months  of my life. I view in the vision of my mind Forty thousand  men in these mountains bearing the Holy and Everlasting   Priesthood of the Son of God and these men were fore-  ordained before the world was created to come here   on the Earth in this dispensation on purpose to labor  with the Lord to build up his kingdom on the Earth, and   then I view in the vision of my mind forty Million   Devels, fallen spirits gathered to gether to make war against     
 Oct 9, 1875  These forty thousand priest of the Lord and strive  to hender their building up the Kingdom of God,  and we have fulfilled as a people that part of the   Saviors parable of the Ten Virgins whare He says  that while the Bridegroom tarried they all slumbered   and slep. we have all slumbered ^and slept^ and the word of   the Lord to me is that it is time for this kingdom  of Priest to arise and trim their lamps and to  take oil in their vessels with their lamps & prepare  to go forth to meet the Bridegroom for He is at  the door. It is time for Zion to arise and let her   light shine I do hope that this body of Bishops  and Elders will carry out the council of president   Brigham Young to go to & organize our wards   into the United Order. Some Bishop say they cannot   see it, then let all such resign their office & let some  other man take it who has the light of Christ in   him and can see it, let no Bishop stand in the way  of the Kingdom of God. O ye Elders of Israel it   is time for us to set our Houses in order & prepare   for that which is to come. It is time for us to teach   our wives & children to lay aside the New York  Ledger and all other novels and store up ^in^ our minds  with the Revelations of God, And we should stop   sending thousands of Dollars out of the Country to buy   Novels to teach our children ^vanity^ and sustain our own   press and Evry family in Zion should take the   Juvinile Instructor, and our owne papers     
 Oct 9, 1875  I will also say we have many Bishops & Elders who   have but one wife who are abundantly able to support more  but their wives will not let them do it, any man who   will permit a woman to lead him and bind him down   is of but little account in the Church o& Kingdom of God  this law of the patriarchal order of marriage & pluraliy  of wives is a Revelation & Commandment of God to us   and we should obey it. But one says if you do judge  MCkane will be after you. But who cares for Judge   McKain or any of the wicked world. This warefare  is between God & the Devil, Christ & Balial, Saint & Sinner  light & Darkness good & Evil. Do Right and let the   consequences follow, Jesus Christ & his Saints will   overcome & gain the victory. What has given us the  victory since we have been in these vallies of the Mountains  The Lord hath done it because we have obeyed that part of   the Celestial Law of God, and it is by this principle that   our Delegate in Congress has been sustained there so   long because He has sustained this law. Then ye Bishops  & Elders arise & keep this law that you may inherit   its glory. Again I wished to say to the Bishops go   to & obey President Youngs council in storeing up the  grain of your wards, for I tell you in the name of   Jesus Christ that famine is among the judgments of God   which are at the Door of this generation, and judgments  will begin at the House of God and to befor many years have  Have or Els the Lord never spake by my mouth Amen

 WILFORD WOODRUFFS  JOURNAL   FOR   1876     
 January 1, 1876 ~ Saturday      Jan 1, 1876. This is the commencement of the Centennial  year of the American independence at the commencement of the   centaury 1776, and through the Revolutionary war the United   States Government was composed of an honest, industrious  Christian People, and the Leaders were pure true, virtueous   honest industrious statesmen who labored hard to promote   the interest, & welfare of the whole people, and to Esstablish a   free Republican Government, this they did accomplish,  and Esstablished laws and a Constitution which was a  glorious Legacy to their posterity. But Jan 1, 1876 finds   a great change has come over the American Government  virtue has departed from the Land, and corruption occupies  its place. Honesty has been driven from Evry department  of Government from the presidential chair, the Halls of   Congress, from Evry Department of State, which has Rea^c^hed   through through Evry State and Territory Except   Utah, and Theft and chicanery are bearing  sway throughout the whole Nation, untill the seeds of  Death and destruction are sown broad cast throughout the  american government, and are ripening for the Harvest.      The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was organiz-  ed in 1830, and has Exhisted in this Government almost half   of the last centaury, and has continued to Grow and   increas for the last 45 years in the midst of all the perscuton   heaped upon it. It is this Church and kingdom of God  who will preservede the Constitution of the United States  if it is preserved at all. Our Nation is declining & falling  through corruption and its End will be like Greece & Rome

 January 1, 1877 ~ Monday      Jan 1, 1877   [FIGURES] This is a vary important day to the Church and   Kingdom of God on the Earth. President Brigham Young, The  Apostles Wilford Woodruff, Erastus Snow, Brigham Young jr   with some two Thousand Saints assembled within the walls  of the Temple of our God, built in St George, for the purpose of   Dedicating certain Portions of it unto God that we might be prepared  to commence giving Endowments and Blessings and sealings  unto the saints. at 30 Minuts past 12 oclok Elder W. Woodruff   stood on the upper step of the font and called the attention of  the people and said we are this day blessed with a privilege that  but few since the days of Adam have Ever Enjoyed, but few of   the sons of Adam have Ever had the privilege of Entering into a   Temple built By the commandment of God in which to admi-  nister ordinances both for the living and the dead. We have  now assembled to dedicate portions of this Temple unto God, and I  have a request to make of all the saints who are present and I   suppose all who are profess to be saints for none others should be  here. I realize that this assembly cannot bow the knee in their   crouded condition But you can bow your heads and your  hearts unto God and this I want you to do this day and those  who offer up Prayers in the dedication of this Temple I want   their words repeated in secret by this assembly befor the Lord  that our prayers may assend into the Ears of the Lord of Sabath  that they may be answerd upon our heads The saints do not prize as  they should the blessings they Enjoy, at the cloths of thes remarks  The following Hymn was sung The spirit of God like a fire is burning  Then Erastus Snow anounced that Elder Wilford Woodruff   would Offer the dedication Prayer

But thou hast raised up unto thyself  thy servant Brigham Young as a Lawgiver unto Israel and   a leader of thy People. Thou has taken unto thyself his councellors   Willard, Jedediah, Heber and George A. Yet thou hast  sustained thy servant Brigham for a generation as   men count time by the right hand of thy power. He has  been with thy people through all their afflictions and per-  secutions and led them to these mountains of Israel and guided  and directed the settlements of thy saints and all the affairs   of Zion as inspired by the power of God in this the last dispensation  and fulness of times in the which thou hast said thou wouldst   Esstablish thy Kingdom to be thrown down not more forever     
 Jan 1, 1877  Therefore O Lord our God we pray that thou wilt give thy people   faith that we may claim this blessing of thee the Lord of Hosts   that thou wilt lay thy hand upon thy servant Brigham unto   the renewal of his body and the healing of all of his infirmities   and the lengthning out of his days and years yea O Lord may   he live to behold the inhabitants of Zion united and enter into the  Holy Order of God, and keep the Celestial Law that they may be  justified before Thee May he live to behold Zion redeemed and   successfully fight the devils visible or invisible that make war   upon thy Saints May he live to behold other Temple built and ded-  icated unto thy name and accepted of Thee O Lord our God, and   we pray thee our Father in heaven in the name of Jesus Christ if   it can be consistent of thy will that thy servant Brigham   may stand in the flesh to Behold the Nation who now occupies   the land upon which thou O Lord hast said the Zion of God   should stand in the Latter Day That Nation who hast shed the  Blood of Prophets and Saints which cry unto God day and night   for vengance. The Nation who are making war against God and his   Christ, That Nation whose sins wickedness and abominations   are assending up before God and to heavenly Hosts which causes   all Eternity to be pained and the Heavens to weep like the falling rain   yea O Lord that He may live to see that Nation (if they will not  repent and serve God) broaken in peasces like a potters vessel and  swept from off the face of the Earth as with the besom of destruction  as were the Jaredites and Nephites that the land of Zion may scease  to groan under the wickedness and abominations of those who now  cumber the ground And we pray thee O God that thou wilt   bless all the councillors to thy servant Brigham

May thye Blessings of Sarah, Huldah, Hannah, Anna, & Mary  the Ancient Prophetess and Holy women rest upon them.      O God of Abram, Isaac, & Jacob, we ask thee in the name   of Jesus Christ they Son that thou wilt Remember thy covenants  which thou hast made with the whole house of Israel, remember   them in all their abidings in these last days. we Pray thee in this   the Temple of our God that thou wilt make bare thine arm of power  in the preservation and salvation of the small remnant of   the Laminites that are left in the land deliver them O God from   the hand of the gentiles who seek to annihilate them from  off the Earth, inspire their hearts with thy spirits to receive   the Gospel of the Son of God that they may be prepared to   build up Zion and fulfill the covenants and promises made   unto them by their forefathers who inherited this land. Remember   O Lord thy covenant people in the North Country Hasten the day   when they shall come in rememberance before Thee when their  Prophets shall smite the rocks, and the mountains of Ice shall   flow down before them May the highway spedily be cast up   in the midst of the great deep, that they may come over dry   shod. May the Everlasting hills tremble at their Presence and   their Enemies become a prey unto them May they come forth   unto Zion and bow the knee that they may be crowned in Zion  under the hands of Ephraim thy servants. We also pray thee   O God that thou wilt remember in Mercy the sons of Judah  upon whose heads the Blood of Jesus Christ has rested for   Eighteen hundred years. They have been trampled under

Brethren and Sisters do you understand     
 Jan 1, 1877  this it seems a great many of the people know nothing   about it. It is true that Solomon built a Temple for the purpose   of Giving Endowments but from what we can learn of the History   of that time they gave vary few if any Endowments and one of   the High Priest was murdered by wicked and corrupt men   who had already began to apostitize because he would not reveal  those things appertaining to the Priesthood that was forbidden   for him to reveal untuill he came to the proper place. I will not   say but what Enoch had Temples and officiated in them but we   have no account of it we know that he raised up a people so pure  and Holy that they were not permitted to remain with the wicked   inhabitants of the Earth but were taken to another place. we as   Latter Day Saints have been laboring for over forty years and   the revelations given us in the first were to esstablish the kingdom  by gathering the Saints, Building Temples, and organizing the   people as the family of heaven here on the Earth. we reared  up a Temple in Kirtland but we had no basement in it nor a font or   preparations to give Endowments for the living or the dead it was left   by the Saints they going to Missouri. Joseph Located the site for  the Temple in Jackson Co Mo, and pointed out the South East cornor   of the Temple in the year Eighteen hundred thirty one. Also laid   the Cornor Stone for a Temple in Far west Caldwell County Mo  but these temple were not built. we built one in Nauvoo. I could   pick out several before me now that were there when it was built   and know just how much was finished and what was done  it is true we left Brethren there with instructions to finish it and   they got it nearly completed before it was burned but the Saints   did not Enjoy it. Now we have a Temple which will all     
 Jan 1, 1877  be finished in a few days and of which their is enough completed  to commence work therein which has not been done since the days  of Adam that we have any knowledge of, now these that can   see the spiritual Atmosphere can see that many of the saints are   still glued to this Earth and lusting and Longing after the things of  this world in which there is no profit. It is true we should   look after the things of this world and devote all to the building up of  the Kingdom of God According to the present feeling of many   of our Brethren they would arogate to themselves this world and   all that pertains to it, and scease not day nor night to see that   it was devoted to the building up of the kingdom of the Devil, and  if they had the power they would build a railroad to carry it   to hell and esstablish themselves there whare are the Eyes and   hearts of this people whare is their interest for their own   salvation and that of their fore fathers. We Enjoy privileges that   are Enjoyed by no one Els on the face of the Earth, supposing   we were awake to this thing namly the salvation of the human family  this house would be crouded as we hope it will be from Monday   morning untill Saturday night. This House was built here  in this place purposely whare it is warm and plesant in the  winter time and comfortable to work also for the Lamanites  and all those coming from the South to receive their Endow-  ments and other Blessings. What do you suppose the fathers   would say if they could speak from the dead would they   not say we "have lain here thousand of years here in this prision House  waiting for this dispensation to come here we are bound and fettered in the  association of those who are filthy, what would they whisper in our   Ears why if they had the power the vary thunders of heaven would be in     
 Jan 1, 1877  our Ears if we could not realize the importance of the work we are inga-  ged in, all the Angels in heaven are looking at this little handful of people  so also are the devils in hell looking at this people too and trying to overth  row us and the people are still shaking hands with the devil instead  of sanctifying themselves and calling upon the Lord and doing his   work which He has commanded us and put into our hands to   do. when I think upon this subject I want the Tongues of seve[n]  thunders to wake up the people Can the Fathers be saved without us  No. Can we be saved without them No. and if we do not   wake up and scease to long after the things of this Earth we will   find that we as individuals will go down to Hell although the   Lord will preserve a people unto himself Now we are ready to   give Endowments do you have any feelings for those who have   died without hearing the gospel. The spirit has awakened in the   people in the North when we gave the word that we should   do no more work in the Endowment House they came to us crying   and pleading to be baptized for their dead what Els could th[e]y   do they can come here and do the work for their dead and  put these poor prisioners on the ground whare they will be  free, do we realize this as long as we tarry here we are subject to the   world, but now go to like men and women and say we will   Embrace the Truth and Enter into the covenants of God and   carry them out then the bonds are broaken and the Harts of the   people are united in the Father. Perhaps Brethren and Sisters you   will not get my meaning but now go to work and let these infer-  nal holes in the ground alone, and let the Gentiles alone who   would destroy us if they had the power you are running after  them and ^some of^ our Brethren are putting their wives and daughters     
 Jan 1, 1877  into their society and will go to the devil with them to if they do not look  out. I would not have a dollar on the Earth if I had to get it there, it  has been the kingdom of God with me and what I have I have got in  this kingdom Well now some of the Elders are running after these  holes in the ground and I see men here before me in this house that  have no right to be here they are as corrupt in their harts as they  can be and we take them by the Hand and call them Brother you  will go to Hell lots of you unless you repent you may think this is   plain talk it is not as plain as you will find by and By. you will go  to the gates of Heaven and Jesus will say I never knew you while you  have been saying your prayers and going to your Meeting and [are] as cor-  rupt in your hearts as man can be you had better stop now and   repent of your sins and sin no more while their is yet time and   before the doors are closed against you I want to awake you up   and if I had the power to lift the veil from your Eyes and let you   see things as they are you would be asstonished not but what there  are a great many of the people as good as they know how to be, now  I will say Bless the people that they may do better But show some   of the Elders of Israel according to their present conduct a   dollar one one side and Eternal Life on the other and I fear they  would chuse the Dollar we are now prepared to attend to Bap-  tizing and giving Endowments and shall appoint Tuesdays   and wednesdays for Baptisms and Thursdays and Fridays  for Endowments and sealings as a standing appointment for   the present God Bless you Amen I do not know whether the people  are satisfied with the services of the dedication of the Temple or not  I am not half satisfied and I never Expect to be satisfied untill the devil is  whiped and driven from off the face of the Earth.

I was  there surrounded with one hundred and fifty four  virgins, Maidens Daughters and Mothers in Zion from   the age of fourteen to the Aged Mother leaning upon her  staff. All had assembled for the purpose of Entering   into the Temple of the Lord to make me a birth day Present  by being washed And Anointed and receiving their Endo-  wments for and behalf of one hundred and Thirty   of my wives who were dead and in the spirit wor[l]d   the majority of which had been sealed to me and the rem-  ainder were to be, therse persons had been sealed to me during   the last fifteen years by Presidents Brigham Young, Heber  C. Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, G. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F.  Smith. Also 2Twenty four near relatives were added to     
 to this list of wives for whom these beloved Sisters in   Zion were to receive their Endowments this day. As this was   to be confined to the sisters alone No men were to receive their  Endowments to day. I put into this list all my near Relatives  and saved none of the Thompson, Hart, or Woodruff family  Except My own Mother Bulah Thompson Woodruff   and Grand Mother ^Dinah^ Woodford Woodruff My Step Mother  Azubah Woodruff was officiated for. Eudora L. Young  Officiated for my ownly Sister Eunice Woodruff.  And when this record was All made out the sisters  occupied all five of the washing Bathes in the Temple, all  the sisters were washed and Anointed Among the number  were three wives and four daughters of President Brigham  Young viz Lucy B. Young Margarett Pierce Young, Naamah C.  Young, ^Twiss^ and, Susie Young Dunford, Eudora Young, Rhoda M Young, Shamira   Young, & Ruth Young when they had all assembled to gether  in the Creation Room I presented myself before them  clothed in my white Doe skin Temple dress. I there delivered  unto them a short address, But I had not Enough of immor  tality about me to fully answer my mind. my soul was  almost to full for utterance The following is a synopsis of my   speech. My Beloved Sisters I present myself before you   this morning, not ownly with prayer and fasting, but a heart  filled with praise and Thanksgiving to my Heavenly Father  for his mercy and kindness unto me, And also to you my   sisters for a Blessing of such magnitude as you are prese-  nting unto me this day. I do not suppose that A scene of  this kind was Ever presented before the heavens or the     
 Earth, before God, Angels, or Man from this Earth  since the foundation of world was laid: Therefore I  feel justified in changing the order of the lecture usally   given here, there is no men here and all of you here heretofore  received your Endowments. I feel that it is due you at   this time and place to give you the origin of this scene which  is presented before us today. Ever since I have been working  in this Temple my mind has been Exercised in behalf of the  dead, And have felt a great desire to see my dead redeemed  before I passed away. A few days ago I went into the  Cealing room whare I often go to pray for I consider  there is no spot on this Ear[t]h more acceptable tha[n]   this Temple and while there I went befor the Lord   with this subject resting upon my mind And I prayed  the Lord to open My way to see my Dead Redeemed,  And while I prayed the spirit of the Lord rested  upon me and conveyed the following Testimony to  [FIGURES] me. Let my servant Wilford call upon the virgins  Maidens, Daughters, & Mothers in Zion and let them   Enter into my ^Holy^ Temple on the 1 day of March the  day that my servant Wilford has seen the time   alloted to man, Three score years and Ten, and   there let them received their washing and Anont-  ings and Endowments for and in behalf of the wives  who are dead and halve been sealed to my servant  Wilford, or those who are to be sealed to him, and this  shall be acceptable unto me Saith the Lord, and the   dead of my servant shall be redeemed in the spirit     
 world and be prepard to meet my servant at   the time of his coming which shall be at the time  appointed unto him, though not revealed to man  in the flesh[##Mark 13:32##], Now go to and perform this work   and all shall be accomplished according to the desire of   your heart. This was mearly a key to me,  light burst upon my understanding. I saw an Effetual   door open to me for the redemption of my dead, And   when I saw this I felt like shouting Glory Hallalulah  to God and the Lamb. Now in this matter you can be   baptized for any number on the same day, but when   you come to giving Endowments one person can ownly   attend to one in a day. Some of those women you have   been officiating for have been sealed to me, some have not  those that were sealed to me were sealed at various times   during the last twenty years, By President Young, H. C. Kimball,   D. H. Wells, G. Q. Cannon and J. F. Smith I have never   taken this course without consulting President Young.  when this thing was manifest to me I said to some of the  sisters that I would like to have them come on my  Birth day day and make me ^a^ present by getting Endowments  for some of my dead, and as a testimony to me all   were willing. When I saw the magnitude of this I spoke   to President Young about it he said he would funish   half a dozen himself and He has in this assembly 5   widaughters and 3 wives I feel thankful to you my sisters   for this manifestation of Kindness for you might have  searched the world over and you could not have found a     
 presidentesent as deare to me as this. what is gold or silver in  comparison to the redemption of our dead, Nothing.  if I can redeem my dead, and save myself and family  I will be satisfyed. I feel that when we get into the   spirit world we shall see the importance of this days work  This is my birth day, I am three score years and tten to   day. you are to day in this Endowment withoutowt a man   with you. But we shall furnish one Man as an   Adam L John Nuttall, will officiate as such, Sisters   you have the Blessings and Gratitude of my heart, And   I hope I may not ownly partake of Eternal life with   those whom you are redeeming to day, But with all   of you who are laboring for them this day. I pray   that we may all meet with them in the Celestial kingdom  of our God Amen. I went through the Endowments   of the day more like being in vision than a reality  These 154 Sisters were led to three veils and   three of us Wilford Woodruff J. D. T McAllister   & L John Nuttall all dressed in Temple Clothing  took them all through the three veils. I took through   about 60, at the Middle veil, which I attended (there   was no sealing to day) President young was present at   the Temple in witnessing the ceremonies. At the close of   the labor at the temple I took a carriage and rode to   David M Cannons, from there I was Accompanied   to St George Hall by McAllister, Raleigh and   Nuttall & D M Cannon and placed in the midst  of a surprize Party Got up for the Occasion the Room     
 decorated, foand a Table set loaded with all the   luxeries of life, surrounded by nearly one hundred   of those who had been receiving Endowments for my   dead during the day. President Young set at the head of   the Table surrounded By his family and after Blessing  was asked their was presented before me a present   of a birth day Bridal Cake three stories high  adorned with the beasts of the field from the Elephant   down, and ornamented with two satin sheets covered   with Printed Poetry composed for the occasion and   these two sheets of Poetry had to be taken and read   Before the Assembly by Susan Young Dunford, the following   is the poetry contained on the two sheets of satin on   the other Page. This scene this day is among the most   wonderful Events of the last dispensation and fulness  of times in which we live, and this door which is  open for the redemption of the Dead in this manner will   accomplish great and important Results, for it is now being   carried out in a great many instances in the Temple of the   Lord, and will continue to be more and more unto the End  this above remark is made on the 12 day of March upon   the Events taken place since the 1 day of March, by this labor  in redeeming our dead by Proxey much can be accomplished  our dead can be redeemed. This principle has given me great  Joy unspeakable at the thought that I can live on the Earth  to behold my Numerous friends redeemed who are in the   spirit world, this principle says to us in loud languae  that the Lord is Good and Gracious, and his Mercies Endureth forever     
 To   Elder Wilford Woodruff,   On the anniversary of his 70 Birth  Birthday, spent in the Temple of the   Lord, officiating for his dead   June Hazel Dall (By proxy)      Thy seventieth year is now complete  Oh, what a glorious day!

Full well they know thy power and place  Thy honered calling here,  And they rejoice that thou hast lived  To bless them in there sphere.      How often the destroyer came  To loose the band of life,  And sou^ght^ to bear thee from the Earth,  Because of thy belief—      Because thy work on Earth was great  And much was still to come,  He many times has sought thee out,  But thou wast not alone;      A power above his power, forbid  Rebuked him and he fled  And left thee, still to Bless mankind  The living and the dead.      And we rejoice with thee to day,  That thou hast lived to see  This birth day, in this holy house  All hail! all hail! to thee.      May many birthdays still be thine  we wish thee peace and Joy,  with gifts from heaven and boons of Earth  May naught, thee, ne'er annoy      Emily B. Spencer

I met  him going down the Hill from the Temple and Joseph  Smith introduced me to him He gave me a Butcher knife     
 July 6, 1877  which I carried to Clay Co Mo I spent sever  days with Joseph Smith the Prophet in Kirtland and  went with him to Clay County Mo in the spring of 1834  I have passed through the whole History of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from that day to   this, And I wish to bear my testimony that while  there is but two of the Quorum of the Twelve organized  with Brigham Young living in the Church to day, viz  Orson Hyde, & Orson Pratt, That Joseph Smith was  a prophet of God Ordained from before the foundation  of the world to come forth in this last dispensation   and fulness of times to lay the foundation of this Church   and kingdom of God on the Earth and He was sustained   untill He lay the foundation of the Church and kingdom   and performed all that God ordained him to perform   which He did accomplish And after so long a time  I am called to preside over the ownly Temple on the  Earth whare the Saints of God can administer  in the ordinances of the House of the Lord for the deceased   in a manner that will be acceptable unto the Lord  Their is a few of us still alive who went in Zions   Camp, and I will here say God has inspired me to  keep a Journal and History of this Chiurch and I  warn the future Historians to give credence to my  History of this Church and kingdom for my   Testimony is true, and the truth of its Record  will be manifest in the world to come for I   with President Brigham Young and others of us     
 July 6, 1877  will soon be in the spirit ^world^ with Joseph, Hyrum   David, Heber, Wilard, Ezra T, George A Smith,   and A Host he of other Men who have kept the command-  ments of God, And I hereby testify in the name of   Jesus Christ that the Bible is true the stick of Judah,  and that the Book of Mormon the stick of Joseph is true,  And that the Doctrin and Covenants are true which  are given through the mouth of Joseph Smith the   Prophet of God raised up in these last days through  the loins of Ancient Joseph who was sold into Egypt  all the words of the Lord will be fulfilled upon the Nations  which are written in that Book. The American Gover-  nment will be broaken in peaces like a potters vessel  and swept from off the face of the Earth, and cast   down to Hell, Because of their wickedness Murders  whoredoms and abominations For the Lord God hath  spoken it and it will be fullfilled. Therefore awake   and arise O Zion, slet the People of Zion sanctify  themselves before the Lord and purify themselves and  be prepared for the Redemption of Zion and the  coming of the Son of Man for his coming is at the  door and will overtake the world as a thief in the night [##1 Thessalonians 5:2##]      July 7, 1877 ~ Saturday      July 7. we Met in the Tabernacle for a 2 days Meeting  as a quarterly conference for the St Georg Stake  Henry Harriman opened by Prayer Edward Bunker  spoke 30 M[inutes] Marius Ensign 18 M[inutes], John Parker 13,  Robert Nell spoke 9 M[inutes], Godwdy Hagen 20 M[inutes]  J.

I composed myself   for sleep but could not sleep. I felt a strange stupor   come over me and apparently became partially   Unconscious. Still I was not asleep, nor awoke   With a strange far away dreamy feelings the  first I recognized was that I was in the Tabernacle   at Ogden sitting on the back seat in the corner for   fear they would call upon me to Preach which   after singing the second time, they did by calling me to   the stand. I arose to speak and said I did not   Know that I had any thing special to say Except to   bear my Testimony to the Truth of the Latter Day work   when all at once it seemed as though I was lifted   out of myself, and I said "yes I have sumthing to   say, it is this– some of my brethren present have been  asking me what is coming to pass, what is the wind   blowing up. I will answer you right here what is   coming to pass shortly. I was immediately in, Salt     
 June 15 1878  Lake City wandering about the streets in all parts of the   city and on the door of every house I found a badge  of mourning, and I could not find a house but what   was in mourning. I passed by my own house and   saw the same sigm there, and asked "Is that me   that is dead" Sumthing gave me answer "No   youll live through it all" It seemed strange to  me that I saw no person [on] the street in my wandering  about through the City, they seemed to be in their houses   with their sick and Dead. I saw no funeral possess-  ion, or any thing of that kind, but the city looked   vary still and quiet as though the people were praying  and had controll of the desease what ever it was  I then looked in all directions over the Territory, East   West North and South, and I found the same mourn-  ing in every place throughout the Land. The next   I knew I was Just this side of Omaha. It seemed   as though I was above the Earth, looking down to it   as I passed along on my way East and I saw the   roads full of people principally women with just   what they could carry in bundles on therir backs   travelling to the mountains on foot, and I wond-  ered how they could get there, with nothing but   a small pack upon their backs. It was remarkable   to me that there were so few men among them, it   did not seem as though the cars were running  the rails looked rusty, and the road abandoned, And   I have no conception how I travelled myself     
 June 15 1878  As I looked down upon the people I continued Eastward   through Omaha and Council Bluffs which were   full of disease, and women every whare The States   of Missouri and Illinois were in turmoil and strife,  Men killing each other, and women joining in the   fight, family against family cutting each other to   peaieces in the most horrid manner. The next I   saw was Washington, and I found the City a  Desolation. The white House Empty, the Halls of Con-  gress the same. Every thing in ruins, the people   seemed to have fled from the city and left it to   take care of itself. I was next in the city of Baltimore   and in the square whare the Monument of 1812  stands, in front of St Charles and other Hotels   I saw the Dead piled up so high as to fill the square  I saw Mothers cut the throats of their own   children for the sake of their blood, which they   drank from their veins, to quench their thirst   and then lie down and die. The waters of the  Chesapeake and of the city were so stagnant and  such a stench arose from them on account of   the putrefaction of Dead bodies that the vary smell  caused Death, and that was singular again   I saw no man except they were dead, lying in   the streets, and vary few women, and they   were crazy mad, and in a dying condition  Every whare I went I beheld the same all over   the city, And it was horrible beyound description     
 June 15 1878  to look at. I thought this must be the End. But No   I was seemingly in Philadelphia and there every-   thing was still no living soul was to be seen to greet   me, and it seemed as though the whole City was   without an inhabitant. In arch and chestnut   street and in fact Every whare I went the putrifcation  of the Dead bodies caused such a stench that it was   Impossible for any creature to Exhist alive, nor did   I see any living thing in the City. I next found   myself in Broadway New York and here it   seemed the people had done their best to overcome   the Disease. But in wandering down Broadway   I saw the bodies of Beautiful women lying stone   dead, and others in a dying condition on the side   walk. I saw men crawl out of the cellars and   rob the dead bodies of the valuables they had on  and before they could return to their coverts in the   cellars they themselves would roll over a time or   towo and die in agony. On some of the back streets   I saw Mothers kill their own children and   Eat raw flesh and then in a few minuts   die themselves. Whareever I went I saw the   same scenes of Horror and Desolation rapine and   Death. No Horses or carriages, No busses   or street cars, but Death and Destruction evry whare  I then went to the Grand Central Park and looking  back I saw a fire start and just at that moment  a mighty East wind sprang up and carried the flames     
 June 15 1878  West over the City, and it burned untill there was   not a single building left standing whole Even down  to the wharfs, and the shiping all seemed to be burned  and swallowed up in the common destruction   and left Nothing but a Desolation whare the great   City was a short time before. The stench from the   bodies that were burning was so great that it was   carried a great distance across the Hudson River  and bay, and thus spread deisease and death wha-  reever the flames penetrated. I cannot paint in   words the Horror that seemed to Encompass me around  It was beyound description or thought of man   to conceive. I supposed this was the End but I was   here given to understand, that the same horror   was being enacted all over the country. North   South East and West, that few were left alive  still there were some. Immediately after I   seemed to be standing on the west bank of the   Missouri River opposite the City at Independance   but I saw no city I saw the whole states of Miss-  ouri & Illinois and part of Iowa were a com-  plete wilderness with no living human being im  them. I then saw a short distance from the river   Twelve men dressed in the robes of the Temple stand[in]g   in a square or nearly so.
