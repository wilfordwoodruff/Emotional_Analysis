I Consulted my Atorney In Regard to haveing my Case disposed of as soon as Possible on account of the call made upon me.   before the next Term of Court Or sometime In Febuary. Therefor If you think It wise to Extend the time untill my Property Is out of Jeopardy I would gladly Respond. From your Brother In the Gospel     as far as I Can assertain       ENDENTRY  that the Lord did not wish him to come and receive his blessings  in the House of the Lord. I have reasons to sustain this beleif— I have felt thus to express myself    in their faith, without so much distinction and classification, as we have  in our Babylonish Pride and Classifycation of S.L.C. and other older settlements,  which proved a curse to both the Jaredites as well as the overthrow of the  Nephites..... since I have been here by request I have given 6 public  Lectures in Alberta on the subject of the early rise of the Church and the  comeing forth of the Book of Mormon Illustrated by 3 paintings one of the  Hill Cumorah 2 Record and the 3 the Prophets, and sent to Prophessor Martin Harris from the  unusualy large Audiances, and the attraction and manifestations of the good Spirit ##Joseph Smith-History 1:59## it wonderfully well remmunerates me for my expence and pains without other Compensation for all of those Lectures are Freely given as freely received I have  given about 150 of them free, now this in part answers the question asked  by you, when I visited you recently at the Gardo House on the unplesant  affair of Widdow Manwareing, What are you doing these Times? on the 1 day of May next. I shall- (thank God.) be 72 years of age, and have spent 58 years of  that time in my Masters cause, and as a poor Widdows son, trying to save one soul- conquer and save Edward Stevenson, which if I succede I shall be sattisfied and well  repaid for all the battles fought........ As to Sister Electa Manwareing my Daughter by my 3 and I think I have been very poorly repaid, for with my own hands building a house  and making a presant of it and 10 acres of land to her, also of funishing her  bread—and some money and other things, so that now I have concluded to turn the  matter over to her Brotherinlaw and her brothers and placeing in their hands 500 for them to pay the interest to her they all agree to aid her (and I hold myself ready to see and do through them other help) So I think this may cut the thread which has  subjected me to so much criticism by the 1 and I hope in the future save you so much trouble with the Widow.  I believe I have done pretty well for one who last year paid 300 and Louie Stevenson 500 80 abide with you I am your Brother in the covenant Edward Stevenson.
