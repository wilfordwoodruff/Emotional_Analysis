 That Temple was built in the Town of Kirtland Geauga Co OhioHe received the priesthood in his youth, and He was but a boywhen He went up in Zions Camp for the redemption of zionin 1834, forty one years before his death, and He has labored diligently for the building up of the kingdom to the day of his death.He has been true and faithful in his labor & Testimony to the End.

Q. Cannon J. Taylor W Woodruff & D H Wells [FIGURE] W. Woodruff said I feel to bear my testimony to what the Apostles Have said to you I have had vary peculiar feelings for the last 3 monthsof my life. I view in the vision of my mind Forty thousandmen in these mountains bearing the Holy and Everlasting Priesthood of the Son of God and these men were fore-ordained before the world was created to come here on the Earth in this dispensation on purpose to laborwith the Lord to build up his kingdom on the Earth, and then I view in the vision of my mind forty Million Devels, fallen spirits gathered to gether to make war against 
 Oct 9, 1875These forty thousand priest of the Lord and striveto hender their building up the Kingdom of God,and we have fulfilled as a people that part of the Saviors parable of the Ten Virgins whare He saysthat while the Bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slep. we have all slumbered ^and slept^ and the word of the Lord to me is that it is time for this kingdomof Priest to arise and trim their lamps and totake oil in their vessels with their lamps & prepareto go forth to meet the Bridegroom for He is atthe door. It is time for Zion to arise and let her light shine I do hope that this body of Bishopsand Elders will carry out the council of president Brigham Young to go to & organize our wards into the United Order. Some Bishop say they cannot see it, then let all such resign their office & let someother man take it who has the light of Christ in him and can see it, let no Bishop stand in the wayof the Kingdom of God. O ye Elders of Israel it is time for us to set our Houses in order & prepare for that which is to come. It is time for us to teach our wives & children to lay aside the New YorkLedger and all other novels and store up ^in^ our mindswith the Revelations of God, And we should stop sending thousands of Dollars out of the Country to buy Novels to teach our children ^vanity^ and sustain our own press and Evry family in Zion should take the Juvinile Instructor, and our owne papers 
 Oct 9, 1875I will also say we have many Bishops & Elders who have but one wife who are abundantly able to support morebut their wives will not let them do it, any man who will permit a woman to lead him and bind him down is of but little account in the Church o& Kingdom of Godthis law of the patriarchal order of marriage & pluraliyof wives is a Revelation & Commandment of God to us and we should obey it. But one says if you do judgeMCkane will be after you. But who cares for Judge McKain or any of the wicked world. This warefareis between God & the Devil, Christ & Balial, Saint & Sinnerlight & Darkness good & Evil. Do Right and let the consequences follow, Jesus Christ & his Saints will overcome & gain the victory. What has given us thevictory since we have been in these vallies of the MountainsThe Lord hath done it because we have obeyed that part of the Celestial Law of God, and it is by this principle that our Delegate in Congress has been sustained there so long because He has sustained this law. Then ye Bishops& Elders arise & keep this law that you may inherit its glory. Again I wished to say to the Bishops go to & obey President Youngs council in storeing up thegrain of your wards, for I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ that famine is among the judgments of God which are at the Door of this generation, and judgmentswill begin at the House of God and to befor many years haveHave or Els the Lord never spake by my mouth Amen

 WILFORD WOODRUFFSJOURNAL FOR 1876 
 January 1, 1876 ~ SaturdayJan 1, 1876. This is the commencement of the Centennialyear of the American independence at the commencement of the centaury 1776, and through the Revolutionary war the United States Government was composed of an honest, industriousChristian People, and the Leaders were pure true, virtueous honest industrious statesmen who labored hard to promote the interest, & welfare of the whole people, and to Esstablish a free Republican Government, this they did accomplish,and Esstablished laws and a Constitution which was aglorious Legacy to their posterity. But Jan 1, 1876 finds a great change has come over the American Governmentvirtue has departed from the Land, and corruption occupiesits place. Honesty has been driven from Evry departmentof Government from the presidential chair, the Halls of Congress, from Evry Department of State, which has Rea^c^hed through through Evry State and Territory Except Utah, and Theft and chicanery are bearingsway throughout the whole Nation, untill the seeds ofDeath and destruction are sown broad cast throughout theamerican government, and are ripening for the Harvest.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was organiz-ed in 1830, and has Exhisted in this Government almost half of the last centaury, and has continued to Grow and increas for the last 45 years in the midst of all the perscuton heaped upon it.

The Congregation was thenrequested to remain seated while the President Members of the Twelve and a few others of the Priesthood repaired above to the sealing room then some Twenty went up to the sealing roomwhen a Hymn was sung (Come let us renew) Then Elder BrighamYoung Jr offerd up athe following PrayerO Lord God of Israel Thou who showest Mercy unto thosewho walk uprightly before thee according to the light in themto thee we bow in humble Reverence and call upon thy Holy Nameon this occasion of Dedicating portion of this Temple created for Holy purposes dispensing the ordinances of thy House unto thisgeneration their progenitors and posterity hear and Answer 
 Jan 1, 1877the Prayers offerd by thine Apostles Wilford Woodruff and Erastus Snow that they may penetrate the Ears of the LordSabbaoth that the blessings of God may rest upon and in this building from the foundation to the Towers thereof, and now our Father we have assembled in this upper room wharein we anticipate performing the ordinances of sealing women to Men children to their Parents and man to his fellow man that the bond may reach unto heaven thy dwelling place and whenwe attain to that happy state and rise with the just in the morningof the first resurrection that we may legally claim the Relationship of Husbands and wives parents and children and be crowned Sons and Daughters of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ our Elder Brother We dedicate this room unto thee, the circular Stairs leading to it the board nai[l]sand paint which compose the stairs the Timbers upon which they rest the studing, ILath, plastering and nailes with the several parts thereof, And we dedicate this room unto the[e]O Our Father the walls and the stones of which they arebuilt, with the sand and lime and all timber which rest in the walls the Joist and their Bridging and the double floorswhich rest upon the Joist and the nails and fastnings thereof and the plaster upon the walls and the ornamental cornice and the centre ornament and the materials of which they are composed and the stove and fixtures within this room together with the windows wtheir casings weights and cords sash glass andpaint.

Brethren and Sisters do you understand 
 Jan 1, 1877this it seems a great many of the people know nothing about it. It is true that Solomon built a Temple for the purpose of Giving Endowments but from what we can learn of the History of that time they gave vary few if any Endowments and one of the High Priest was murdered by wicked and corrupt men who had already began to apostitize because he would not revealthose things appertaining to the Priesthood that was forbidden for him to reveal untuill he came to the proper place. I will not say but what Enoch had Temples and officiated in them but we have no account of it we know that he raised up a people so pureand Holy that they were not permitted to remain with the wicked inhabitants of the Earth but were taken to another place. we as Latter Day Saints have been laboring for over forty years and the revelations given us in the first were to esstablish the kingdomby gathering the Saints, Building Temples, and organizing the people as the family of heaven here on the Earth. we rearedup a Temple in Kirtland but we had no basement in it nor a font or preparations to give Endowments for the living or the dead it was left by the Saints they going to Missouri. Joseph Located the site forthe Temple in Jackson Co Mo, and pointed out the South East cornor of the Temple in the year Eighteen hundred thirty one. Also laid the Cornor Stone for a Temple in Far west Caldwell County Mobut these temple were not built. we built one in Nauvoo. I could pick out several before me now that were there when it was built and know just how much was finished and what was doneit is true we left Brethren there with instructions to finish it and they got it nearly completed before it was burned but the Saints did not Enjoy it. Now we have a Temple which will all 
 Jan 1, 1877be finished in a few days and of which their is enough completedto commence work therein which has not been done since the daysof Adam that we have any knowledge of, now these that can see the spiritual Atmosphere can see that many of the saints are still glued to this Earth and lusting and Longing after the things ofthis world in which there is no profit. It is true we should look after the things of this world and devote all to the building up ofthe Kingdom of God According to the present feeling of many of our Brethren they would arogate to themselves this world and all that pertains to it, and scease not day nor night to see that it was devoted to the building up of the kingdom of the Devil, andif they had the power they would build a railroad to carry it to hell and esstablish themselves there whare are the Eyes and hearts of this people whare is their interest for their own salvation and that of their fore fathers. We Enjoy privileges that are Enjoyed by no one Els on the face of the Earth, supposing we were awake to this thing namly the salvation of the human familythis house would be crouded as we hope it will be from Monday morning untill Saturday night. This House was built herein this place purposely whare it is warm and plesant in thewinter time and comfortable to work also for the Lamanitesand all those coming from the South to receive their Endow-ments and other Blessings. What do you suppose the fathers would say if they could speak from the dead would they not say we "have lain here thousand of years here in this prision Housewaiting for this dispensation to come here we are bound and fettered in theassociation of those who are filthy, what would they whisper in our Ears why if they had the power the vary thunders of heaven would be in 
 Jan 1, 1877our Ears if we could not realize the importance of the work we are inga-ged in, all the Angels in heaven are looking at this little handful of peopleso also are the devils in hell looking at this people too and trying to overthrow us and the people are still shaking hands with the devil insteadof sanctifying themselves and calling upon the Lord and doing his work which He has commanded us and put into our hands to do. when I think upon this subject I want the Tongues of seve[n]thunders to wake up the people Can the Fathers be saved without usNo. Can we be saved without them No. and if we do not wake up and scease to long after the things of this Earth we will find that we as individuals will go down to Hell although the Lord will preserve a people unto himself Now we are ready to give Endowments do you have any feelings for those who have died without hearing the gospel. The spirit has awakened in the people in the North when we gave the word that we should do no more work in the Endowment House they came to us crying and pleading to be baptized for their dead what Els could th[e]y do they can come here and do the work for their dead andput these poor prisioners on the ground whare they will befree, do we realize this as long as we tarry here we are subject to the world, but now go to like men and women and say we will Embrace the Truth and Enter into the covenants of God and carry them out then the bonds are broaken and the Harts of the people are united in the Father. Perhaps Brethren and Sisters you will not get my meaning but now go to work and let these infer-nal holes in the ground alone, and let the Gentiles alone who would destroy us if they had the power you are running afterthem and ^some of^ our Brethren are putting their wives and daughters 
 Jan 1, 1877into their society and will go to the devil with them to if they do not lookout. I would not have a dollar on the Earth if I had to get it there, ithas been the kingdom of God with me and what I have I have got inthis kingdom Well now some of the Elders are running after theseholes in the ground and I see men here before me in this house thathave no right to be here they are as corrupt in their harts as theycan be and we take them by the Hand and call them Brother youwill go to Hell lots of you unless you repent you may think this is plain talk it is not as plain as you will find by and By. you will goto the gates of Heaven and Jesus will say I never knew you while youhave been saying your prayers and going to your Meeting and [are] as cor-rupt in your hearts as man can be you had better stop now and repent of your sins and sin no more while their is yet time and before the doors are closed against you I want to awake you up and if I had the power to lift the veil from your Eyes and let you see things as they are you would be asstonished not but what thereare a great many of the people as good as they know how to be, nowI will say Bless the people that they may do better But show some of the Elders of Israel according to their present conduct a dollar one one side and Eternal Life on the other and I fear theywould chuse the Dollar we are now prepared to attend to Bap-tizing and giving Endowments and shall appoint Tuesdays and wednesdays for Baptisms and Thursdays and Fridaysfor Endowments and sealings as a standing appointment for the present God Bless you Amen I do not know whether the peopleare satisfied with the services of the dedication of the Temple or notI am not half satisfied and I never Expect to be satisfied untill the devil iswhiped and driven from off the face of the Earth.

I wasthere surrounded with one hundred and fifty fourvirgins, Maidens Daughters and Mothers in Zion from the age of fourteen to the Aged Mother leaning upon herstaff. All had assembled for the purpose of Entering into the Temple of the Lord to make me a birth day Presentby being washed And Anointed and receiving their Endo-wments for and behalf of one hundred and Thirty of my wives who were dead and in the spirit wor[l]d the majority of which had been sealed to me and the rem-ainder were to be, therse persons had been sealed to me during the last fifteen years by Presidents Brigham Young, HeberC. Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, G. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F.Smith. Also 2Twenty four near relatives were added to 
 to this list of wives for whom these beloved Sisters in Zion were to receive their Endowments this day. As this was to be confined to the sisters alone No men were to receive theirEndowments to day. I put into this list all my near Relativesand saved none of the Thompson, Hart, or Woodruff familyExcept My own Mother Bulah Thompson Woodruff and Grand Mother ^Dinah^ Woodford Woodruff My Step MotherAzubah Woodruff was officiated for. Eudora L. YoungOfficiated for my ownly Sister Eunice Woodruff.And when this record was All made out the sistersoccupied all five of the washing Bathes in the Temple, allthe sisters were washed and Anointed Among the numberwere three wives and four daughters of President BrighamYoung viz Lucy B. Young Margarett Pierce Young, Naamah C.Young, ^Twiss^ and, Susie Young Dunford, Eudora Young, Rhoda M Young, Shamira Young, & Ruth Young when they had all assembled to getherin the Creation Room I presented myself before themclothed in my white Doe skin Temple dress. I there deliveredunto them a short address, But I had not Enough of immortality about me to fully answer my mind. my soul wasalmost to full for utterance The following is a synopsis of my speech. My Beloved Sisters I present myself before you this morning, not ownly with prayer and fasting, but a heartfilled with praise and Thanksgiving to my Heavenly Fatherfor his mercy and kindness unto me, And also to you my sisters for a Blessing of such magnitude as you are prese-nting unto me this day. I do not suppose that A scene ofthis kind was Ever presented before the heavens or the 
 Earth, before God, Angels, or Man from this Earthsince the foundation of world was laid: Therefore Ifeel justified in changing the order of the lecture usally given here, there is no men here and all of you here heretoforereceived your Endowments. I feel that it is due you at this time and place to give you the origin of this scene whichis presented before us today. Ever since I have been workingin this Temple my mind has been Exercised in behalf of thedead, And have felt a great desire to see my dead redeemedbefore I passed away. A few days ago I went into theCealing room whare I often go to pray for I considerthere is no spot on this Ear[t]h more acceptable tha[n] this Temple and while there I went befor the Lord with this subject resting upon my mind And I prayedthe Lord to open My way to see my Dead Redeemed,And while I prayed the spirit of the Lord restedupon me and conveyed the following Testimony to[FIGURES] me. Let my servant Wilford call upon the virginsMaidens, Daughters, & Mothers in Zion and let them Enter into my ^Holy^ Temple on the 1 day of March theday that my servant Wilford has seen the time alloted to man, Three score years and Ten, and there let them received their washing and Anont-ings and Endowments for and in behalf of the wiveswho are dead and halve been sealed to my servantWilford, or those who are to be sealed to him, and thisshall be acceptable unto me Saith the Lord, and the dead of my servant shall be redeemed in the spirit 
 world and be prepard to meet my servant at the time of his coming which shall be at the timeappointed unto him, though not revealed to manin the flesh[##Mark 13:32##], Now go to and perform this work and all shall be accomplished according to the desire of your heart. This was mearly a key to me,light burst upon my understanding. I saw an Effetual door open to me for the redemption of my dead, And when I saw this I felt like shouting Glory Hallalulahto God and the Lamb. Now in this matter you can be baptized for any number on the same day, but when you come to giving Endowments one person can ownly attend to one in a day. Some of those women you have been officiating for have been sealed to me, some have notthose that were sealed to me were sealed at various times during the last twenty years, By President Young, H. C. Kimball, D. H. Wells, G. Q. Cannon and J. F. Smith I have never taken this course without consulting President Young.when this thing was manifest to me I said to some of thesisters that I would like to have them come on myBirth day day and make me ^a^ present by getting Endowmentsfor some of my dead, and as a testimony to me all were willing. When I saw the magnitude of this I spoke to President Young about it he said he would funish half a dozen himself and He has in this assembly 5 widaughters and 3 wives I feel thankful to you my sisters for this manifestation of Kindness for you might havesearched the world over and you could not have found a 
 presidentesent as deare to me as this. what is gold or silver incomparison to the redemption of our dead, Nothing.if I can redeem my dead, and save myself and familyI will be satisfyed. I feel that when we get into the spirit world we shall see the importance of this days workThis is my birth day, I am three score years and tten to day. you are to day in this Endowment withoutowt a man with you. But we shall furnish one Man as an Adam L John Nuttall, will officiate as such, Sisters you have the Blessings and Gratitude of my heart, And I hope I may not ownly partake of Eternal life with those whom you are redeeming to day, But with all of you who are laboring for them this day. I pray that we may all meet with them in the Celestial kingdomof our God Amen. I went through the Endowments of the day more like being in vision than a realityThese 154 Sisters were led to three veils and three of us Wilford Woodruff J. D. T McAllister & L John Nuttall all dressed in Temple Clothingtook them all through the three veils. I took through about 60, at the Middle veil, which I attended (there was no sealing to day) President young was present at the Temple in witnessing the ceremonies. At the close of the labor at the temple I took a carriage and rode to David M Cannons, from there I was Accompanied to St George Hall by McAllister, Raleigh and Nuttall & D M Cannon and placed in the midstof a surprize Party Got up for the Occasion the Room 
 decorated, foand a Table set loaded with all the luxeries of life, surrounded by nearly one hundred of those who had been receiving Endowments for my dead during the day. President Young set at the head of the Table surrounded By his family and after Blessingwas asked their was presented before me a present of a birth day Bridal Cake three stories highadorned with the beasts of the field from the Elephant down, and ornamented with two satin sheets covered with Printed Poetry composed for the occasion and these two sheets of Poetry had to be taken and read Before the Assembly by Susan Young Dunford, the following is the poetry contained on the two sheets of satin on the other Page. This scene this day is among the most wonderful Events of the last dispensation and fulnessof times in which we live, and this door which isopen for the redemption of the Dead in this manner will accomplish great and important Results, for it is now being carried out in a great many instances in the Temple of the Lord, and will continue to be more and more unto the Endthis above remark is made on the 12 day of March upon the Events taken place since the 1 day of March, by this laborin redeeming our dead by Proxey much can be accomplishedour dead can be redeemed. This principle has given me greatJoy unspeakable at the thought that I can live on the Earthto behold my Numerous friends redeemed who are in the spirit world, this principle says to us in loud languaethat the Lord is Good and Gracious, and his Mercies Endureth forever

 July 6, 1877which I carried to Clay Co Mo I spent severdays with Joseph Smith the Prophet in Kirtland andwent with him to Clay County Mo in the spring of 1834I have passed through the whole History of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from that day to this, And I wish to bear my testimony that whilethere is but two of the Quorum of the Twelve organizedwith Brigham Young living in the Church to day, vizOrson Hyde, & Orson Pratt, That Joseph Smith wasa prophet of God Ordained from before the foundationof the world to come forth in this last dispensation and fulness of times to lay the foundation of this Church and kingdom of God on the Earth and He was sustained untill He lay the foundation of the Church and kingdom and performed all that God ordained him to perform which He did accomplish And after so long a timeI am called to preside over the ownly Temple on theEarth whare the Saints of God can administerin the ordinances of the House of the Lord for the deceased in a manner that will be acceptable unto the LordTheir is a few of us still alive who went in Zions Camp, and I will here say God has inspired me tokeep a Journal and History of this Chiurch and Iwarn the future Historians to give credence to myHistory of this Church and kingdom for my Testimony is true, and the truth of its Recordwill be manifest in the world to come for I with President Brigham Young and others of us 
 July 6, 1877will soon be in the spirit ^world^ with Joseph, Hyrum David, Heber, Wilard, Ezra T, George A Smith, and A Host he of other Men who have kept the command-ments of God, And I hereby testify in the name of Jesus Christ that the Bible is true the stick of Judah,and that the Book of Mormon the stick of Joseph is true,And that the Doctrin and Covenants are true whichare given through the mouth of Joseph Smith the Prophet of God raised up in these last days throughthe loins of Ancient Joseph who was sold into Egyptall the words of the Lord will be fulfilled upon the Nationswhich are written in that Book. The American Gover-nment will be broaken in peaces like a potters vesseland swept from off the face of the Earth, and cast down to Hell, Because of their wickedness Murderswhoredoms and abominations For the Lord God hathspoken it and it will be fullfilled. Therefore awake and arise O Zion, slet the People of Zion sanctifythemselves before the Lord and purify themselves andbe prepared for the Redemption of Zion and thecoming of the Son of Man for his coming is at thedoor and will overtake the world as a thief in the night [##1 Thessalonians 5:2##]July 7, 1877 ~ SaturdayJuly 7. we Met in the Tabernacle for a 2 days Meetingas a quarterly conference for the St Georg StakeHenry Harriman opened by Prayer Edward Bunkerspoke 30 M[inutes] Marius Ensign 18 M[inutes], John Parker 13,Robert Nell spoke 9 M[inutes], Godwdy Hagen 20 M[inutes]J.

I composed myself for sleep but could not sleep. I felt a strange stupor come over me and apparently became partially Unconscious. Still I was not asleep, nor awoke With a strange far away dreamy feelings thefirst I recognized was that I was in the Tabernacle at Ogden sitting on the back seat in the corner for fear they would call upon me to Preach which after singing the second time, they did by calling me to the stand. I arose to speak and said I did not Know that I had any thing special to say Except to bear my Testimony to the Truth of the Latter Day work when all at once it seemed as though I was lifted out of myself, and I said "yes I have sumthing to say, it is this– some of my brethren present have beenasking me what is coming to pass, what is the wind blowing up. I will answer you right here what is coming to pass shortly. I was immediately in, Salt 
 June 15 1878Lake City wandering about the streets in all parts of the city and on the door of every house I found a badgeof mourning, and I could not find a house but what was in mourning. I passed by my own house and saw the same sigm there, and asked "Is that me that is dead" Sumthing gave me answer "No youll live through it all" It seemed strange tome that I saw no person [on] the street in my wanderingabout through the City, they seemed to be in their houses with their sick and Dead. I saw no funeral possess-ion, or any thing of that kind, but the city looked vary still and quiet as though the people were prayingand had controll of the desease what ever it wasI then looked in all directions over the Territory, East West North and South, and I found the same mourn-ing in every place throughout the Land. The next I knew I was Just this side of Omaha. It seemed as though I was above the Earth, looking down to it as I passed along on my way East and I saw the roads full of people principally women with just what they could carry in bundles on therir backs travelling to the mountains on foot, and I wond-ered how they could get there, with nothing but a small pack upon their backs. It was remarkable to me that there were so few men among them, it did not seem as though the cars were runningthe rails looked rusty, and the road abandoned, And I have no conception how I travelled myself 
 June 15 1878As I looked down upon the people I continued Eastward through Omaha and Council Bluffs which were full of disease, and women every whare The States of Missouri and Illinois were in turmoil and strife,Men killing each other, and women joining in the fight, family against family cutting each other to peaieces in the most horrid manner. The next I saw was Washington, and I found the City aDesolation. The white House Empty, the Halls of Con-gress the same. Every thing in ruins, the people seemed to have fled from the city and left it to take care of itself. I was next in the city of Baltimore and in the square whare the Monument of 1812stands, in front of St Charles and other Hotels I saw the Dead piled up so high as to fill the squareI saw Mothers cut the throats of their own children for the sake of their blood, which they drank from their veins, to quench their thirst and then lie down and die. The waters of theChesapeake and of the city were so stagnant andsuch a stench arose from them on account of the putrefaction of Dead bodies that the vary smellcaused Death, and that was singular again I saw no man except they were dead, lying in the streets, and vary few women, and they were crazy mad, and in a dying conditionEvery whare I went I beheld the same all over the city, And it was horrible beyound description 
 June 15 1878to look at. I thought this must be the End. But No I was seemingly in Philadelphia and there every- thing was still no living soul was to be seen to greet me, and it seemed as though the whole City was without an inhabitant. In arch and chestnut street and in fact Every whare I went the putrifcationof the Dead bodies caused such a stench that it was Impossible for any creature to Exhist alive, nor did I see any living thing in the City. I next found myself in Broadway New York and here it seemed the people had done their best to overcome the Disease. But in wandering down Broadway I saw the bodies of Beautiful women lying stone dead, and others in a dying condition on the side walk. I saw men crawl out of the cellars and rob the dead bodies of the valuables they had onand before they could return to their coverts in the cellars they themselves would roll over a time or towo and die in agony. On some of the back streets I saw Mothers kill their own children and Eat raw flesh and then in a few minuts die themselves. Whareever I went I saw the same scenes of Horror and Desolation rapine and Death. No Horses or carriages, No busses or street cars, but Death and Destruction evry whareI then went to the Grand Central Park and lookingback I saw a fire start and just at that momenta mighty East wind sprang up and carried the flames 
 June 15 1878West over the City, and it burned untill there was not a single building left standing whole Even downto the wharfs, and the shiping all seemed to be burnedand swallowed up in the common destruction and left Nothing but a Desolation whare the great City was a short time before. The stench from the bodies that were burning was so great that it was carried a great distance across the Hudson Riverand bay, and thus spread deisease and death wha-reever the flames penetrated. I cannot paint in words the Horror that seemed to Encompass me aroundIt was beyound description or thought of man to conceive. I supposed this was the End but I was here given to understand, that the same horror was being enacted all over the country. North South East and West, that few were left alivestill there were some. Immediately after I seemed to be standing on the west bank of the Missouri River opposite the City at Independance but I saw no city I saw the whole states of Miss-ouri & Illinois and part of Iowa were a com-plete wilderness with no living human being imthem. I then saw a short distance from the river Twelve men dressed in the robes of the Temple stand[in]g in a square or nearly so. I understood it resprese-nted the Twelve gates of the New Jerrusalem, and they were with hands uplifted consecrating the ground and laying the Corner Stones. I saw myriads 
 June 15, 1878of Angels hovering over them and around about them and also an immens pillar of a cloud over them and I heard the singing of the most beautif[ul] music the words "Now is esstablished the Kingdom of our God and his Christ and He shall reign forever and Ever, and the Kingdom shall never be Throwndown for the Saints have overcome" and I saw people coming from the River and different places a long way off to help build the Temple, and it seemed that the Hosts of the angels also helped to get the materialto build the Temple, and I saw some come who wore their Temple Clothing Rob[e]s to help build the Temple and the City and all the time I saw the great pillar of cloud hovering over the placeInstantly I found I was in the Tabernacle at Ogden yet I could see the building going on and got quite animated in calling to the people in the Tabernacle to listen to the beautiful music that the Angels were Making. I called to them to look atthe Angels as the House seemed to be full of them and they were saying the same words that I heard Before "Now is the Kingdom of Our God Esstablished forever & Ever.["] and then a voice said "Now shall come to pass that which was spoken by Isaiahthe Prophet "That seven women shall take hold of one man saying &c["] {##Isaiah 4:1##]. At this time I seemed to stagger back from the pulpit & F D Richards and some one els caught me and prevented me from falling when I requested Brother Richards to 
 June 15 1878apologise to the audience for me because I stoped so adruptly and tell them I had not fainted but was exhausted I rolled over in my bed and heard the City Hall clock strike TwelveJune 16, 1878 ~ SundayJune 16 sunday [FIGURES] I received a Letter from J.
