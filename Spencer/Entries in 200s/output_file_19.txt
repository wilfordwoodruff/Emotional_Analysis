While in the penitentiary I formed the ac- quaintance of a country man of mine, who was being held on ^a^ charge of illegal voting, who had traveled much in many countries, and who had been in Central and South America, and spent some years in Guatemala, which is the most northern of the five Central American Republics, containing something over 40,000 qr. miles, with a population of about 1 1/2 millions. The climate is tropical, but quite healthy as a rule, as the country consists mainly of table-lands of different alti- tudes.  The soil is very fertile, and produces in profution a great variety of tropical fruits, bananas, bread-fruit, plantain, sarsaparilla, mahogany, logwood andc. Sugar cane and coffee are cultivated. When cane is planted once, it grows for ten years, producing two crops a year. Coffee is a profitable product for exportation.

Gold and silver mines are aboundant, though but little worked. In Guademala the mines are owned by the government, but can be leased for one third. In Honduras, mines can be located and claimed like in the United States. Nicaragua is the largest of the five republics, having an area of 58,000 Sq. miles, with only about 400,000 in- habitants. The governments of those countries hold out great inducements to white settlers, giving 120 acres of land with one yoke of oxen, one plow, such as they have them, three cows to a man, and if he is married he gets six cows. Seven years settlement is required to aquire government title to the land. Much of the government land has already crops growing; such as bananas, sarsaparilla, mahogany trees andc., for which there is always a market.  There is no import duty, but "Free Trade."   There, is a country already made, with many facilities awayi thing the enterprice and progressiveness of the Anglo- Saxon race, and it is probable that greater induce- ments would be offered for colonyization, as I read in the papers not long ago that a company of capitalists from Rhroad Island had got a large tract of land in Honduras, with several miles of sea coast, where they purpus raising and exporting tropical fruits andc. The price of labor is high, as the natives can not see the philosophy in working where they can get every thing they need without work.

ENDENTRY The greater part of the population constists of Indians and mestizos. The whites are Spanish as a rule. The Indians are superior to the Mexicans in appearance, but are indolent and non progress- ive, and no interest is taken in church or school, still, some of the Government Officials are well educated and con speak several languages.  In South America are some fine countries also. The Argentine Republic is a very large country with a mild climate something like that of California, and the soil is very productive. A few years ago the government of that country offered to every family, who would come and settle per- manently, 600 acres of land and a horse team with harness, wagon and such farming imp- lements as they have. There are quite a number of Europeans there, engaged in agriculture and stock raising; but the great majority of the population in all those countries are Lamanites, a people in whome we as Latter-day Saints have reason to feel much interested, and among whom we understand is a great work to be performed in the near future.  There are some disadvantages, of course, in those countries, the main one being the un- stableness of the governements; but it is dificult perhaps to find a government enywheres now whose stability can be dependet upon, that of our own nation not excepted.

I have beleived David, and if misled in this, I am open to conviction, and request to be corrected, for I have been in the Church since 1833—58 years and wish to inculcate correct doctrines.  David also related that while comeing from Harmony Pa,- about halfway to Fayett, N.Y.- which was June 1829—they saw Maroni who at that time appeared as an ordinary man and common attire with a knapsac on his back, he asked him to ride with them, but he replied I am only goind over to Cumorah, steped back and disappeared. Olliver and David asked the Prophet to enquire of the Lord who this misterious and distinguised visitor was. David told me that when he looked back at the Proptet he looked to him nearly transparent and said that was Maroni with the plates, andc.- soon after their arrival at Fayett, David said his mother saw Maroni and he also opened the plates turning them over leaf by leaf— but there was some portion sealed with 3 gold rings...... my visit was very much enjoyed and had a very good impression upon him.

As to Sister Electa Manwareing my Daughter by my 3rd wife. I have often felt greived at the trouble you have been subjected to— and I think I have been very poorly repaid, for with my own hands building a house  and making a presant of it and 10 acres of land to her, also of funishing her ceal and bread—and some money and other things, so that now I have concluded to turn the  matter over to her Brotherinlaw and her brothers and placeing in their hands 50000  for them to pay the interest to her they all agree to aid her (and I hold myself ready to see and do through them other help) So I think this may cut the thread which has  subjected me to so much criticism by the 1st council of the Church.  and I hope in the future save you so much trouble with the Widow.
