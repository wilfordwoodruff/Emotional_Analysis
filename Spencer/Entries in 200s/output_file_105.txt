We crossed the wabash and spent the day and night with Dr Modesett a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints. I was much fatigued and had a fever. I had an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams that had been a constant companion of Br Asahels for several years and appeared to be the most capable of giving me a correct account concerning him in evry point of view, of any man in the West. written sideways in left margin^ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF^  He informed me that in the main point he was vary steady and temporate in his habits, and did not believe in the principle of white lying or misrepresenting in order to carry on his business or merchantdize, he got along well in his business untill the last year of his life, he had bought a large quantity of Books and they did not sell as well as he expected and he was not able to meet all of his payments, this was a source of much regret to him and the main cause  of his esstate being insolvent. During the last year of his life he manifested a desire to more fully improve his mind than he ever had done. he read many of Thomas Paine's writing and they more fully esstablished him in the gospel of Jesus Christ although Pains writing were against the gospel. Asahel considered his writings eisily to be refuted. Asahel was more free to open his mind to Mr Adams than any other man consequently he was more capable of Judging of his views and feelings upon spiritual subjects he informed me that his mind was deeply ingaged  in the subject of the faith of the latter Day Saints. At first he said but little about it but before his   ENDENTRY death he warmly contended for the principles and defended the cause of the Latter Day Saints when it was assailed. Asahel (in one sens of the word) was not himself but another man during the last four months of his life he was abent minded and overwhelmed in deep study and thought for hours together at times he would ride half a day beside Mr Adams and not utter a word, and at other times he would speak to him two or three times before he would notice him or speak to him. he lost his former cheerfulness and during those four months he more freequently spoke of his friends and relatives than before esspecially myself and most of father's family. he was making preperation to go east and was ownly hendered by his sickness and death. He freequently spoke of Death and of the uncertainty of life. he was teacher in the Sunday School in the Presbyterian Church for a length of time in Terr Haute though not a member of the church. by any means. He had freequently argured against against the principles of Dancing schools, but got to attend a part of a quarter during this peculiar state of mind and also some parties. But Mr Adams thought he would not have done it if he had been perfectly himself. Mr Adams was absent from Terre Haute During Asahels sickness and Death selling books for him. Asahel wrote him two letters and Mr Adams judjing from the contents of these letters that he was evidently growing worse, immediately returned  to Terre Haute and on his arival found that Asahel Hart Woodruff one of his most intimate and best friends on earth was dead and buried. He immediately inquired into his sickness and death and he thinks he would have been more comfortable if he could have been in a private family and been kept from exposing himself to cold and damp air as he was in some degree while under the operation of medicine. Mr Adams also confirmed the statement that his loss was deeply felt in the west by all of his acquaintance and that those peculiar traits which Asahel possessed that interested so many in the east had the same effect in the west. Asahel maintained that the cause of the Latter Day Saints was worthy of a thorough investigation and ought to be carefully searched into. Mr Adams was in Asahels employ untill his death and at the administrators sale he purchased $1000 dollars worth of his books, and is now supplying Asahels former customers.

O Lord preserve us from his grasp I pray that we may have a victory and that  we may have an answer to our prayers and that the Revelations of Jesus Christ may be fulfilled to my Joy   ENDENTRY July 1, 1838 ~ Sunday   JULY 1st 1838. On this seventh month the first day of the month and the first day of the week  which is called Sunday some of the most important events transpired with me that I ever witness- ed since I had a being, events worthy to be recorded upon the ARCHIEVES OF HEAVEN o or to  be engraven with an iron pen and laid in a rock forever upon the EARTH. For I know that my Redeemer  liveth and he hath this day given me with my friends a victory over the Devil that tries the souls of men that dwell upon the face of the earth. My Father Josiah  Woodruff, is a man that hath been seeking religion and the favor of God and light and truth for many years at times, and for  more than 20 years have a numerous circle of friends made his case a subject of Prayer and pled with God in his  behalf. But as oft as my father hath strugled for a victory over sin and its influence heretofore Satan hath temp- ted him and hindered him from gaining the victory. But since I had beame a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints and  entered the New and Everlasting Covenant and had a dispensation of the gospel committed unto me, I felt a deeper interest  than ever in the salvation of the soul of my Father. I had now come to declare a message to my father and his houshold  and teach them words whareby they might be saved. I began to cry unto God for my father and his houshold and the Lord  showed me in a night vision that a great victory was nigh, but the devil fell upon the whole household with great  wrath and tempations some of the time one was ready to fall back and reject the gospel and then again annother. his  power rested upon me at the same time as if to devour me at once but after being confined to my bed for several  hours under his grasp, in the name of Jesus Christ I with my friends birst the Powers of darkness. I went and stood befo- re the people and declaired the gospel of Jesus Christ, and shout O Heavens and rejoice O earth for the victory the Lord  hath given us for after preaching the gospel to the peopl, I immediately assembled upon the bank of Farmington river  whare there was much water and lead six of my friends into the waters of Baptism five of them were my relatives  viz my Father, my Seth Woodruff and the other was  Mr Dwight Webster a methodist class leader. We returned from the water rejoiceing and confirmed them by the laying  on of hands at my fathers house. I organized this small branch of the church being 9 in number 8 of which were my relatives  I ordained Brother Dwight Webster to the office of a Priest. I communed with these saints and unbosomed my feelings unto them which closed the scenes of this interesting day which have come to pass in fullfilment of my Patriarchal blessing under the hands  of the Patriarch JOSEPH   ENDENTRY See Journal Vol 1st April 15. 1837.   Great and marvelous are thy Works O LORD GOD ALMIGHTY   Written upon what came to pass on the first day of July AD 1838 in fulfillment of Revelation   O GOD my heart inspire my pen direct while I record this scene of thy  mercy this blessing of thy love a blessing promised me by the testimony  of JESUS CHRIST. Could I claim it yes by faith all things are possible even that  my parents and friends could in the new covenant with me stand. Without shame  I stood the gospel to declare. It was a sword to pierce the hearts of my friends.  The day has come: they felt that God had sent they must obey. O'er the thresh-  hold of my father's house I walked accompanied by my friends towa- rds the appointed place we bent our way untill upon the rivers bank we  stood. All nature spread her fields of pleasing green. The canal  bold in her bed lay ready her inland commerce to convey. The sun  shed forth her golden beams to gladden earth while the silver  stream was rolling at my feet as if to say I am ready for thee  amid this scenery with feelings better imagined than described  I cast my eyes upon the audiance while we sung praises to the  God of Israel. Who would not have bowed the knee while offe- ring the sacrifice of the heart and imploreing the blessings of hea- ven that the spirit of God the candidates and the waters might  pervade. As from our knees we arose I entered the wattery element  and asked who was ashamed of the bed whare Jesus lay. Many  eyes were turned to behold this scene and deep solemnity veiled  their faces while I took my Father by the hand, my Father did I  say yes HE covenanted to walk with God and for the remission  of his sins I Baptized him. Feeling the victory won my Mother  followed his steps and by obediance was sealed a saint a member  of the kingdom. Eunice my sister my ownly sister was ready her  noble soul by Ephraim's spirit inspired her garb of pride had rent  and broke the gentiles chain, fearless of the world's despiseing  she freely recieved the watery bed her Master to imitate while her  firm example should say celestial glory is my boast the garb of  saints my pride   For the consolation of Israel Anna long had look'd and rejoiced  that she could now the ancient path persue, upon the scene her  daughters gazed as if to say Great God prepare us likewise thy  will to do. Seth in his early youth was not to young his God to se- rve, he desired to follow the example of his father, mother, and brother  that they might be one. John, the Parents and brother  of Seth were baptized on the 12 of July 1839 as my Journal declares  Dwight though not of consanguine blood to me desired baptism  at my hands for by the blood of Christ we were united,  thrice the cross he strove to pass and as oft the spirit pressed his  honest soul and he submitted to obey. Thus ended this scene of  wonder shall I say? yes and of mercy to, for heaven counten- ance'd the deed for it was Gods command an ordinance of the  gospel. TO be permitted to stand in ones own native land and the gosp- el of JESUS CHRIST to declare in the last dispensation and while  dividing the word through the power of the priesthood to his kindred  his townsman to behold the pride of the great, the rich, the lea- rned, by the spirit of God humbled at his feet then to exper- ience the living reality of a Father, a Mother, an ownly Sister  meekly with other kindred receiving the ordinances of the  house of God at the hand of their son and brother is to me  at least a scene of Interest. As we retired from the rolling  stream to a Father's roof my spirit was ready to say forget this  not O my soul regard it as the mercy of thy God while thou dost  pay thy vows thy covenants fulfill. While upon the head of these  Saints my hands were lade I implored the mercy of God for the  Holy Ghost upon them to rest and guide them right. The bread and wi- ne was bles'd and we partook to remember him who died for us. O, Eternal  God these Saints inspire, protect, support, defend and untill in Zion they stand  and with celestial glory crowned an heir with GOD AND CHRIST   ENDENTRY FIGURE A  List of the names of the Church  of Latter Day Saints Baptized and organized in  Farmington Connecticut,  ENDENTRY July 1st 1838 by Willford Woodruff   TITLES NAMES   FATHER APHEK WOODRUFF   MOTHER AZUBAH WOODRUFF   SISTER EUNICE WOODRUFF   UNCLE OZEM WOODRUFF   AUNT HANNAH WOODRUFF   COUSIN JOHN WOODRUFF   COUSIN SETH WOODRUFF   AUNT ANNA COSSETT   PRIEST DWIGHT WEBSTER   WILLFORD   ENDENTRY July 2, 1838 ~ Monday   July 2nd I took the parting hand With Brother Webster and I bid him God speed and he returned to his friends  I also took the parting hand with sister Anna, may the  Lord bless them.

After evening prayers with the family Father retired to rest and  I spent a season in conversation with Mother and we felt sensibly the weight of the powers of temptation that try the souls of men but out of them all the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spent a short time  with Sister Eunice before retireing we mingled our sympathys tears and prayers together before a Throne  of grace, truly how strong is the cord of consanguinity and of the Blood of Christ united in binding the  hearts of saints together.

FIGURE I learn from experienc  that the Saint must watch and pray lest he enter into tempation and in order to overcome the  devil we must continually be on our watch tower, the Saint in any age of the world cannot  pass through their allotted portion of existance on flowery beds of ease in this life. I am now daily making  preperations to leave the state of Scarborough to lead a company  of Saints from the Islands of the Sea to the land of Zion in the far west. I shall be accompanied by  my child. It is the greatest trial Phebe has ever been called to pass through to take the parting  hand of her Parents, Brethren and Sisters, and neighbours and perhaps for the last time, and go a journey of  two thousand miles late in the fall and start with a babe of two monts old which is in the first stage  of the hooping cough and to add to this to leave a kind father's house of plenty and go to a new country and  settle among strangers after the flesh. These kind reader are the meditations that are daily running  with the rapidity of lighting through the mind of my bosom friend and companion and to add the insinuation  of friends against such a course of procedings, and all the temptations that the devil is capable of  inventing are crouded into the mind in order to hinder the will of God being done. Thus standing in the  midst of such a position nothing but a saint could stand the shock nothing but a God could support the  sinking soul.
