 the kingdom of God, which was words were fulfilled this day.      I confirmed those baptized and organized this small   branch of the church, consisting of 9 members, 8 of whom   were relatives, I ordained Dwight Webster a priest, and ad-  ministered the sacrament. unto them.      July 3rd, I started for the state of Maine and   arrived at Father Carter's in Scarborough on the 6th.      14th, My wife was delivered of a daughter at   her fathers house; w we named her Sarah Emma.      22nd, I wrote to Thomas B. Marsh an account   of my labors upon Fox islands and the eastern country.      30th, I left Scarborough and returned to the islands,  I preached several times to large congregations in the Methodist   meeting house, in East Thomastown, and in the town hall in   Cambden, before crossing to the islands, where I arrived Augt. 7      9th, I received a letter from Thomas B. Marsh   informing me of my appointment to fill the place of in   the Quorum of the Twelve, of one who had fallen, and I   was requested to come to Far West as soon as possible to   prepare for a mission to England in the Spring. I immed-  iately visited all the Saints upon both islands, and earnestly   exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves  to accompany me to the body of the church in Missouri.  Several immediately sold, but many were poor.  Bro Nath.  Thomas said he would furnish means to help off all the   poor saints who would desired to go, and for this purpose   went with me to the main land on the 13th, and I   assisted him in procuring ^purshasing^ two thousand dollars worth of horses,   ^harness,^ wagons, & tents &c. ^camp^ for the company, he paid about $1,500 of the   expenses himself, $1,000 of which went to furnish conveyance for the   poor, after purchasing the outfit for the company, and ^I^ urginged the importance  of their starting as soon as possible, not later than the first of Sep.      Aug. 19, I left the town of Camden where we had prepared   our outfit, and returned to Scarborough, to prepare my family for   the journey, expecting to see the company in a few days, but here I     
 have attempted to administer unto her with the  company present But as I was a stranger there and   Br Clayton presiding over the branch I joined him in  administering to the woman. But the unbelief of the wicked  present was so great we could not cast the devil out  of her but she raged wors than before I then ordered  the room to be cleared, and when the company left  the home except the few attending upon her, we laid  Hands upon her and I commanded the devil to  come out of her in the Name of Jesus Christ, and the  devil left her and she was made whole and fell  asleep and the next day being the Sabbath she came  before a large Congregation of people and bore testimony  of what the Lord had done for her. We had a large  assembly through the day and evening to whom I preached  the gospel. on Monday morning the Devil not being  satisfied of being cast out of the woman entered a  little child belonging to the woman but a few months  old I was called upon to visit the child I found it in  great distress [unearthly] in its Mothers arms we laid  hands upon it and called the devil out of it and  the evil spirits had no power over the Household

The company stopped at the house of sister Sarah  B. Foss; we went to work and nailed down all the covers  and painted them, which made them waterproof      4th, we started upon our journey, my child was in  the first stages of the hooping cough, our company consisted of 53  persons; we had 10 wagons, with a pair of horses to each. We had  before us, at this late period, a gloomy land journey of two thousand  miles, from Maine to Missouri; we continued to travel through  rain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until I ^we^ arrived in Rochester,  Sangammon Co., Illinois, Dec. 19, where I stopped and settled   my family and company for the winter ^being unable to proceed further,^; my wife had passed  through a severe course of the brain fever while upon the journey,  and her suffering had been very great, her spirit had left her  body twice to all human appearance, and only been called back  through the prayer of faith and the power of God. Our child  had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly  chilled through my whole system, in crossing the bleak prairies,  that it was two months after I stopped before I got sufficiently  warmed to feel natural.      Bro. Thomas buried one child, and nearly all the  company had been sick through exposure; some of them had stopped  by the way side.      I spent the winter laboring with my hands for the  support of my family.      March 8th, 1839 I attended a conference at Springfield, Ills.,

 Joseph from time to time, as I had opportunity.      July 22nd. I was with Prest. Joseph Smith and his council   and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the pr  Prophet., H^h^e healed many who were sick nigh unto death, among   whom were Elijah Fordham and Joseph B. Nobles; even   the wicked rabble followed to see the sick healed; as Joseph   was about to cross the river a man came to him and asked   him if he would go about 3 miles and heal two of his small   children, who were twins, about 3 months old, and were sick nigh   unto death; he was a man of the world, he had never heard   a sermon preached by a latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could   not go, but he would send a man, after a momen hesitating   a moment, he turned to me and said you go with this man   and heal his children, at the same time giving me a red   silk handkerchief, and said, after you lay hands upon them,   wipe their faces with it and they shall be healed; and as   long as you will keep that handerkerchief it shall ever remain   as a league between you and me: I went and did   as I was told commanded, and the children wasere healed.      On the 25th I was attacked with the chills and fever;   I had a chill every other day and was very sick.      On the ^Augt.^ 8th Octr. I laid my hands upon my wife and   children, blessed them, committed them into the hands of   God, and started upon my English mission, leaving my   family sick, and with not more than 4 days provisions.   Bro. Brigham Young rowed me across the river ^Mississippi^ in a boat; I was   sick and feeble; when I landed I laid down upon the bank   of the river on a side of Sole leather; the Prophet Joseph came   along and looked at me and said, "You are starting on your   mission";  I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a   missionary, I look more fit for a hospital or dis^s^ecting room   than a mission; he replied "what do you say that for, go ahead   in the name of the Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed

 on your mission".  I thanked him. A Bro., came along with   a wagon and carried me a few miles on my road, I started  without purse or scrip; I ^&^ passed by Parley P. Pratt who was   hauling ^e^ ^hewing^ logs for a house, he was bare-foot, bare-headed, with-  out coat or vest on, he said "I have no money but I have   an empty purse, I will give you that." I went a few rods   and found Elder ^H. C.^ Kimball building a log cabin, he said  "I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse"   he blessed me and I went my way, accompanied by Elder   John Taylor. I had a shake of the ague every other day,  and lay on the bottom of the wagon while I traveled.      We staid with Samuel ^H.^ and ^Don^ Carlos Smith at Macomb   & held a meeting with the Saints, in that ^place whereo^ they contributed   $9 to ^our^ necessities, and Geo. Miller gave us a horse.  Father Coltrin was going East, he took us into his wagon   to help us along; we spent five days in Springfield *  [paper inserted over page]  *where Elder Taylor had printed fifteen hundred copies of a the  pamphlet, upon the Missouri persecution; also ^had^ had a trial  with Elder Babbitt ^who^ having prefered a charge against him  for improper conduct. We sold our horse  [end of paper inserted over page]  we administered to him, and he revived; on the follow-  ing day he fell again, and fainted several times, it   seemed as though the destroyer would take his life; we   traveled with him 4 days after he was taken sick.   His sickness proved to be an attack of the billious   fever, we stopped with him two days, at a Mormon ^German^  Tavern in Germantown, Wayne Co., Indiana, with a   kind family, with whom he was acquainted; Father   Coltrin would stay no longer; I proposed to remain   with bro. Taylor, but as I was sick with fever & ague,  and not able to take care of myself, bro. Taylor advised   me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, saying  "it is easier to take care of one sick man, than two."     
 I committed him into the hands of God; and the   family promised to do all in their power to make him   comfortable; I parted with ^from^ him with a heavy heart.      Sep. On the 2nd, Novr. I continued my journey with   Father Coltrin to Cleveland, Ohio, I there took steamer on the   10th for Buffalo; had a severe gale and did not reach   Buffalo until the 12th. I traveled to Albany on a canal   boat, had the ague daily, was very sick, had no com-  panion except a sectarian priests who wasere daily lying  lying about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany   for Farmington Ct. on the night of the 19th, and rode all   night and the following day, suffered severely with fever   and ague; I arrived at my father's house in Farmington on   the 21st, quite sick; I found my father and family all well.      On the 27th Sep., 1839, my Maternal Grand-mother,   Anna Thompson, died aged 84; I was too sick to attend   her funeral. It is a singular incident, that my Grandfather   , Lot Thompson, and Anna Thompson, his wife, Samuel Thompson   and Mercy Thompson all of one family died in their 84  th year.      On the 4th October, Adnera Hart, died, bro^ther^ to my   step mother, ^died,^ aged 43, he requested me to preach his funeral   sermon; I had been sick at my father's house with the   ague for fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, and   the hour appointed for the funeral to take place was the   time for my ague, yet I gave out the appointment,  attended the funeral, and preached, an hour and a half  and I had no more ague for many days,. I left on   the 7th, [blank] and visited New York, Long Island, ^&^ New   Jersey; but was in very poor health.      Nov 1st, I assisted Elders Clark, Wright and Mulliner  to set sail for England. Elder John Taylor, ^had^ recovered from   his sickness, and arrived in New York on the 13th Decr,

 1839      On the 19th, Decr in company with Elders John Taylor   & Theodore Turley I went on board the packet ship "Oxford"  and sailed for Liverpool, where I landed January 11th, 1840, in  good health and spirits. When I left my Father, he gave me  some money to assist in paying my passage, also gave me  five dollars which he requested me to keep until I arrived  in Liverpool, saying, I would there need it; this I found  to be true after landing; that money was all we had  to pay our expenses to Preston; and we had two pence left.      We arrived in Preston on the 13th had a happy interview  with Bro. Willard Richards; held a council and agreed  that Elder Taylor go to Liver-pool, Turley to Birmingham  and I go to Staffordshire Potteries.      18th, I arrived in Manchester; met Elder Wm. Clayton  who presided over that branch, numbering 164 members, I   was immediately called upon to visit a woman possessed  with the Devil; she was raging and foaming, and had  to be held by four men, the more we rebuked the Devil the  worse she raged; we continued to pray and administer  until we conquered and cast the Devil out of her, she  arose and gave thanks to the Lord. The Devil then entered  into a young child and we cast the Devil ^him^ out of the  child. I preached several times and laid hands on  twenty eight persons. I then went to Burslem on the 21st  and met with Elder Alfred Cordon, President of the Burslem  branch, which numbered 66. I commenced preaching in  the Staffordshire Potteries, Elder Taylor^urley^ left for Birmingham  on the 29th. I remained in the Potteries some forty days, preaching  daily, baptizing, confirming and blessing children.      On the 1st March ^1,^ as I met in the evening with a  large assembly in Hanly, the Lord revealed unto me  that it would be the last time meeting that I would hold  with the Saints in the Potteries for many days; I told     
 Eighteen hundred and forty four entered with a  cold blustering snow storm. I spent the day plastering  and white washing the Printing Office    On the 3rd a Court of Inquiry was  held at Joseph's Store concerning William and Wilson Law  and William Marks. William Law proffessed to  beleive that Joseph had instructed the police to kill him  but the fact was thus the Law's had turned traitors  and were in reality seeking the life of Joseph by breeing [brewing]  mischief. A second Court was held on the 5th upon  the Same matter    On the 7th Mrs Woodruff and  myself met with the quorum and we had an interesting  time of instruction. I spoke during the day upon  the relationships which we sustain to our posterity and  progenitures in the Resurrection. We returned home  and offered up prayers for the Salvation of our friends  and retired to rest.    During the month of January Elder Taylor

 purchased the Printing Office of President Joseph Smith so  that I had to settle my accounts and close up my  connection with the Establishment    On Sunday evening Jan 21 I  met with my quorum and Parley P Pratt received his   [redacted]. Joseph said concerning Parley  that he had no wife sealed to him for eternity and   asked if there was any harm for him to have another  wife for time and eternity as he would want a wife  in the resurrection or his glory would be clipped.  Many other arguments he used which were rational  and consistant    That day was delivered by  Joseph to a large assembly of Saints a discourse  of which the following is a synopsis.    Sealing the Children to the Fathers    When I consider the surrounding circumstances  in which I am placed this day standing in the  open air with weak lungs and somewhat out of health  I feel that I must have the prayers and faith of my  brethren that God may strengthen me and pour out  his special blessings upon me if you get much  from me this day [FIGURE]    There are many people assembled  here and in this city from various parts of the world  who say that they have to a certainty received a portion  of Knowledge from God by revelation in the way  which He has ordained and pointed out. I shall  take the broad ground then that if we have or can 
 receive a portion of Knowledge from God by immediate revelation  by the same source we can receive all Knowledge    What shall I talk about to day? I know  what brother Cahoon wants about ^me to the^. He wants me to speak  about the coming of Elijah in the Last days. I can see  it in his eye. I will speak upon that subject then    The Bible says I will send you Elijah  before the great and terrible day of the Lord come that he  shall turn the hearts of the children ^Fathers^ to the children and  the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and  smite the earth with a curse. [##Malachi 4:5-6##] Now the word "turn"  here should be translated bind or seal.    But what is the object of this important  mission or how is it to be fulfilled. The Keys are to  be delivered the Spirit of Elijah is to come the Gospel  to be established the Saints of God gathered Zion built  up and the Saints to come up as Saviours on Mount  Zion. But how are they to become Saviours on   Mount Zion? By building their Temples creating   their baptismal fonts and going forth and receiving  all the ordinances baptisms confirmations washings  anointings ordinations and sealing powers upon our  heads in behalf of all our progenitors who are dead  and redeem them that they may come forth in the  first resurrection and be exalted to thrones of  glory with us    Herein is the chain which binds  the hearts of the Fathers to the children and to the children  to the Fathers which fulfills the mission of Elijah  I would to God that this Temple was now done  that we might go into it and go to work and  improve our time and make use of the seals while  they are on earth. The Saints have none too 
 TULLIDGE'S  QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    No. I. OCTOBER, 1883. VOL. III.    AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF    [Column 1]  CHAPTER I.  FAMILY SKETCH. MY EARLY DAYS AND   MINISTRY.    In tracing the history of my fathers, I   find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory   account of the Woodruff family for more   than three generations.    My great grandfather, Josiah Woodruff,   lived nearly one hundred years, and pos-  sessed an iron constitution, and per-  formed a great amount of manual labor   nearly up to the time of his death. His   wife's name was Sarah; she bore to him   nine children as follows:—Josiah, Apple-  ton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda, Phebe,   and two names not given.    My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was   the third son of Josiah. He was born in   Farmington, Hartford County, Connecti-  cut, in 1751; he also possessed a strong   constitution; it was said that he per-  formed the most labor for several years   of any man in Hartford County, and   from over exertion in hewing timber he   was attacked with rheumatism in his right   hip, which caused severe lameness, for   several years before his death. He mar-  ried Dinah Woodford, by whom he had   seven children, viz:—Eldad, Elizabeth,   Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, and Ozem.    Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Eliz-  abeth, Amasa Frisby; Samuel, Miss Case;   Aphek, Beulah Thompson and Azubah   Hart; Titus, Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos   Wheeler; and Ozem, Acksah Merrill and   Hannah Hart; all of whom had large   families.    My grandfather died in Farmington,   with the spotted fever in 1806, aged 55   years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in   1824, in the same place, with a cancer in   the left breast; her sufferings were very   great.    My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born    [Column 2]  in Farmington, November 11th, 1778; he   married Beulah Thompson (who was born   in 1782) November 29th, 1801. She bore   three sons, namely:—Azmon, born No-  vember 29th, 1802; Ozen Thompson,   born December 22nd, 1804; myself, born   March 1st, 1807.    My mother died with the spotted fever,   June 11th, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving   me fifteen months old. My father's second   wife, Azubah Hart, was born July 31st,   1792; they were married November 9th,   1810; they had six children, viz: Philo,   born November 29th, 1811, and died by   poison administered by a physician No-  vember 25th, 1827; Asahel Hart, born   April 11th, 1814, and died in Terrahaute,   October 18th, 1838; Franklin, born   March 12th, 1816, and died June 1st;   Newton, born June 19th, 1818, drowned   September, 1820; Julius, born April 22nd,   1820, and died in infancy; Eunice, born   June 19th, 1821. I married her to Dwight   Webster in Farmington, Connecticut   August 4th, 1841.    My father was a strong constitutioned   man, and has done a great amount of   labor. At eighteen years of age, he com-  menced attending a flouring and saw mill,   and continued about 50 years; most of   this time he labored eighteen hours a day.    He never made any profession of re-  ligion, until I baptized him with all his   household into the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints on the first day of   July, 1838. He was a man of great charity,   honesty, integrity and truth, and made   himself poor by giving to the poor, and   accommodating his fellow men by loan-  ing money and becoming surety for his   neighbors, and always saying yes, to every   man who asked a favor at his hand.    I was born in the north part of the   town of Farmington, now called Avon,   Hartford County, Connecticut, March   1st, 1807. I assisted my father in attend- 
 much time to save and redeem their dead and gather  together their living relatives that they may be saved  also before the earth will be smitten and the condemnation  decreed falls upon the world    I would advise all the Saints to go  to with all their might and gather together all their living  relations to this place that they may be sealed and   saved that they may be prepared against the day when  the Destroying Angel goes forth.    If the whole Church should go to  with all their might to save their dead, seal their  posterity and gather their living friends and spend  none of their time in behalf of the world they  would hardly get through when Night would come  when no man could work    My only trouble at the present  time is concerning ourselves—that the Saints will  be divided and broken up and scattered before we  get our salvation secure; for their are so many fools  in the world for the Devil to operate upon it gives  him the advantage of ten times    The question is frequently asked  can we not be saved without going through with  all these ordinances? I would answer no; not  with the fulness of salvation    Jesus said there were many  mansions in his Father's Kingdom and he would  go and prepare a place for them. ("House" in the  text should have been translated Kingdom). Any  person who is exalted to the highest mansion has to  abide a celestial law and the whole law too; but  here has been a great diffuculty in getting anything  into the hearts of this generation. It has been 
 like splitting hemlock Knotts with a corn dogger [dodger] for a wedge  and a pumpkin for a beetle. Even the Saints are slow to   understand. I have tried for a number of years to prepare  the minds of the Saints to receive the things of God; but  we frequently see some of them after suffering all ^that^ they have  for the work of God fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything  comes that is contrary to their traditions. They cant stand  the fire at all. How many will be able to abide a  celestial law and go through and recieve their exaltation  I am unable to say; but many are called and few  are chosen." [##Matthew 22:14##]    On the 25th I met with the quorum of the Twelve   at the house of President Young.

 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  ing the Farmington Mills, until I was   twenty years of age.    In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill   of my aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I at-  tended three years. In May, 1830, I took   charge of the flouring mill of Mr. Col-  lins, the ax manufacturer, in South Can-  ton, Connecticut. At the end of one   year it was demolished to make way for   other machinery. In March, 1831, I   took charge of the flouring mill owned   by Mr. Richard B. Cowles, of New Hart-  ford, Connecticut. In the spring of 1832,   in company with my oldest brother,   Azmon, I went to Richland, Oswego   County, New York, and purchased a farm   and saw mill, and settled in business.    At an early age my mind was exercised   upon religious subjects, although I never   made a profession until 1830. I did not   then join any church, for the reason that   I could not find any denomination whose   doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with   the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordin-  ances and gifts which the Apostles taught.   Although the ministers of the day taught   that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and   ordinances, which the ancient saints en-  joyed, were done away and no longer   needed, I did not believe it to be true,   only as they were done away through the   unbelief of the children of men. I be-  lieved the same gifts, graces, miracles   and power would be manifest in one age   of the world as in another, when God   had a church upon the earth, and that   the church of God would be re-estab-  lished upon the earth, and that I should   live to see it. These principles were riv-  eted upon my mind from the perusal of   the Old and New Testament, with fervent   prayer that the Lord would show me what   was right and wrong, and lead me in the   path of salvation, without any regard to   the opinions of man: and the whisperings   of the Spirit of the Lord for the space of   three years, taught me that he was about   to set up his church and kingdom upon the   earth in the last days. I was taught these   things from my youth by Robert Mason,   an aged man, who lived in Simsbury, Con-  necticut, who was frequently called the   old prophet Mason; he taught me many   things which are now coming to pass.   He did not believe that any man had   authority to administer in the ordinances   of the gospel, but believed it was our   privilege through faith, prayer and fast-    [Column 2]  ing, to heal the sick, and cast out devils   by the laying on of hands, which was the   case under his administration, as many   could testify.    In 1832, I was inspired to go to   Rhode Island; my brother, Asahel, was   also directed by the Spirit of God to go   to the same place. When we met, we   both told our impressions, and it caused   us to marvel and wonder, what the Lord   wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we   had made preparations to move to the   west, we let outward circumstances con-  trol us, and Jonah-like, instead of going   to Rhode Island, we went to Richland,   Oswego County, New York, and there   remained until December 29th, 1833,   when I heard Elders Zerah Pulsipher and   Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Az-  mon and I believed their testimony, en-  tertained the elders, and offered ourselves   for baptism the first sermon we heard.   We read the Book of Mormon, and I re-  ceived a testimony that it was true.    We soon learned what the Lord wanted   of us in Rhode Island, for at the time we   were warned to go there, two of the   elders were preaching there, and had we   gone, we should have embraced the work   at that time.    December 31st—I was baptized by   Elder Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me   the same evening.    January 2nd, 1834—I was ordained a   teacher, and my brother Azmon, an   elder, and a small branch was organized   of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.    In February following, in company   with Elder Holton, I walked some 60   miles to the town of Fabius, to attend an   evening meeting of the Saints in that   place, where Elder Pulsipher was presid-  ing; I saw the book of commandments   or revelations given through Joseph Smith,   and I believed them with all my heart and   rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-  eral days, and holding several meetings,   we returned home rejoicing.    During the winter, we were visited by   several of the elders. February 1st, Elder   Parley P. Pratt called upon us and in-  structed the branch till midnight; we   had a precious time. I accompanied   brother Pratt to Jefferson County, and   told him my circumstances; he said   it was my duty to prepare myself to go   to Kirtland, and join the Camp of Zion.   I immediately settled my business.

There was at this time quite a  revival throughout Nauvoo and an enquiring after  the things of God by all the quorums of the Church  generally    Joseph's Dream    In the Office of the Prophet on the 3rd of  Feb I was conversing with Willard Richards when  Joseph came in with W. W. Phelps and he related  to us the following dream    "I was standing on a peninsula in  the midst of a large body of water where there appeared  to be a large harbour or a pier built out for boats  to come into. I was surrounded by my friends   and while looking at this harbour I saw a Steam-  boat approaching it. There were bridges on the   pier for persons to cross and there came up a wind  and drove the Steam-boat under one of the bridges  and upset it.    I ran up to the boat expecting the  persons would all drown^ed^ and wishing to do something  to assist them. I put my hand to the side of the boat  and with one surge I pushed it under the bridge and it  righted it up and I told them to take care of themselves. 
 But it was not long before I saw them starting out into the  channel or main body of water again. The storms were  raging and the waters rough. I said to my friends that  if they did not understand the signs and the times and  the spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It was  but a few moments after when we saw the waves break  over the boat and she soon foundered and went down  with all on board and perished    The storm amd waters were still   very rough; yet I told my friends around me that  I believed I could stem those waves and storm and  swim in the waters better than the steam boat  did and that at any rate I was determined to try  it. But my freinds laughed at me and told   me that I could not stand the storm at all  but should be drowned.    The waters looked clear and   beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that   I beleived I could swim and that I would try it  anyhow. They said I should drown. I answered  that I would have a frolic on the water first if  I   did and I drove ^dived^ off into the raging waves. I had  swam but a short distance when a towering wave  overwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myself  upon the top of it. I met the second wave in  the same way and for a while I struggled hard to   live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I   soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmed  the torrent better and better. I soon had power  to swim with my head out of water so the waves  did not break over me at all and I found that I   swam a great distance. In looking about  me I saw my brother Samuel by my side 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  April 11th, 1834—With my horses   and wagon I took Brothers Harry Brown   and Warren Ingles and started for Zion.   I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch   and other elders on the way, and ar-  rived in Kirtland on the 25th day of   April, 1834.    The Prophet Joseph invited me to   make his house my home; I accepted his   offer, and staid with him about one week.   I became acquainted with many of the   high priests, elders and Saints. I spent   one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many   of the elders speak, and I felt to rejoice   before God for the light and knowledge   which was manifested to me during that   day.    The first day of May, 1834, was ap-  pointed for the Camp of Zion to start   from Kirtland to go up to Missouri for   the redemption of their brethren. Only   a small portion of the Camp was ready.   The Prophet told those who were ready,   to go to New Portage and wait for the   remainder. I left, in company with about   twenty men, with the baggage wagons.   At night we pitched our tents. I went to   the top of the hill and looked down upon   the Camp of Israel. I knelt upon the   ground and prayed. I rejoiced and   praised the Lord that I had lived to see   some of the tents of Israel pitched, and   a company gathered by the command-  ment of God to go up and help redeem   Zion.    We tarried at New Portage until the   6th, when we were joined by the Prophet  and eighty-five more men. The day be-  fore they arrived, while passing through   the village of Middlebury, the people   tried to count them; but the Lord multi-  plied them in the eyes of the people; so  that those who numbered them said there  were four hundred of them.    On the 7th, Brother Joseph organized   the camp, which consisted of about one   hundred and thirty men. On the follow-  ing day we continued our journey. We   pitched our tents at night and had prayers   night and morning. The Prophet told   us every day what we should do.    We were nearly all young men, gath-  ered from all parts of the country, and   strangers to each other; but we got ac-  quainted very soon, and had a happy   time together.    It was a great school for us to be led   by a Prophet of God a thousand miles,    [Column 2]  through cities, towns, villages, and   through the wilderness.    When persons stood by to count us   they could not tell how many we num-  bered; some said five hundred, others   one thousand.    Many were astonished as we passed   through their towns. One lady ran to   her door, pushed her spectacles to the   top of her head, raised her hands, and   exclaimed: "What under heavens has   broken loose?" She stood in that posi-  tion the last I saw of her.    The published history of Zion's Camp   gives an account of the bones of a man   we dug out of a mound. His name was   Zelph. The Lord showed the Prophet   the history of the man in a vision. The   arrow by which he was killed was found   among his bones. One of his thigh   bones was broken by a stone slung in   battle. The bone was put into my   wagon, and I carried it to Clay County,   Missouri, and buried it in the earth.    The Lord delivered Israel in the days   of Moses by dividing the Red Sea so   they went over dry shod. When their   enemies tried to do the same, the water   closed upon them and they were drowned. [##Exodus 14:21-31##]  The Lord delivered Zion's Camp from   their enemies on the 19th of June, 1834,   by piling up the waters in Fishing River   forty feet in one night, so our enemies   could not cross. He also sent a great   hail-storm, which broke them up and   sent them seeking for shelter.    The Camp of Zion arrived at Brother   Burk's, in Clay County, Missouri, on   the 24th of June, 1834, and we pitched   our tents on the premises. He told some   of the brethren of my company that he   had a spare room that some of us might   occupy if we would clean it. Our com-  pany accepted the offer, and, fearing   that some other company would get it   first, left all other business and went to   work, cleaning out the room, and imme-  diately spread down our blankets, so as   to hold a right to the room. It was but   a short time afterwards that our brethren,   who were attacked by cholera, were   brought in and laid upon our beds.   None of us ever used those blankets   again, for they were buried with the   dead. So we gained nothing but experi-  ence by being selfish, and we lost our   bedding.    After Joseph, the Prophet, had led 
 I asked him how he liked it and he said first rate and   I thought so too. I was soon enabled to swim with   my head and shoulders out of water and I could swim  as fast as any steamboat. In a little time it   became calm and I could rush through the water only  going in up to my loins. Soon I only went in up  to my knees and finally I could tread upon the top   of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrow  I said to Samuel se[e] how swift I can go and thought   it was great pleasure to travel with such speed   and I awoke."    I continued to meet from time to time  with my quorum for the giving of the [redacted]  [redacted].    Why Joseph was candidate for the   Presidential Chair    A congregation of the citizens met in the room over   Joseph's Store to hear his views upon the affairs  of government which had been written and was   read by W. W. Phelps.    Joseph gave his reasons  for permitting his name to go forth as a candidate   for the presidency of the United States. He said    "I would not have suffered my   name to have been used by my friends on anywise  as President of the United States or candidate for   that office if I and my friends could have had   the privilege of enjoying our religious and civil rights   as American citizens even those rights which

 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  Zion's Camp to Missouri, and we had   passed through all the trials of that jour-  ney, and had buried a number of our   brethren, as recorded in history, the   Prophet called the Camp together, and   organized the Church in Zion, and gave   much good counsel to all.    He advised all the young men, who   had no families, to stay in Missouri, and   not return to Kirtland. Not having any   family, I stopped with Lyman Wight, as   did Milton Holmes and Heman Hyde.   We spent the summer together, laboring   hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock,   making brick, or anything else we could   find to do.    In the Fall I had a desire to go and   preach the gospel. I knew the gospel   which the Lord had revealed to Joseph   Smith was true, and of such great value   that I wanted to tell it to the people   who had not heard it. It was so good   and plain, it seemed to me I could make   the people believe it.    I was but a Teacher, and it is not a   Teacher's office to go abroad and preach.   I dared not tell any of the authorities of   the Church that I wanted to preach, lest   they might think I was seeking for an   office.    I went to the woods where no one   could see me, and I prayed to the Lord   to open my way so that I could go and   preach the gospel. While I was praying,   the Spirit of the Lord came upon me,   and told me my prayer was heard and   that my request should be granted.    I felt very happy, and got up and   walked out of the woods into the trav-  eled road, and there I met a high priest   who had lived in the same house with me   some six months.    He had not said a word to me about   preaching the gospel; but now, as soon   as I had met him, he said, "the Lord   has revealed to me that it is your privi-  lege to be ordained, and to go and   preach the gospel."    I told him I was willing to do what-  ever the Lord required of me. I did   tell him I had just asked the Lord to let   me go and preach.    In a few days a council was called at   Lyman Wight's, and I was ordained a   Priest and sent on a mission into Ar-  kansas and Tennessee, in company with   an elder. This mission was given us by    [Column 2]  Elder Edward Partridge, who was the   first Bishop ordained in the Church.    The law of God to us in those days   was to go without purse or scrip. Our   journey lay through Jackson County,   from which the Saints had just been   driven, and it was dangerous for a Mor-  mon to be found in that part of the   State.    We put some Books of Mormon and   some clothing into our valises, strapped   them on our backs, and started on foot.   We crossed the ferry into Jackson   County, and went through it.    In some instances the Lord preserved   us, as it were by miracle, from the mob.    We dare not go to houses and get   food, so we picked and ate raw corn,   and slept on the ground, and did any   way we could until we got out of the   county.    We dared not preach while in that   county, and we did but little preaching   in the State of Missouri. The first time   I attempted to preach was on Sunday, in   a tavern, in the early part of December,   1834. It was snowing at the time and   the room was full of people. As I com-  menced to speak the landlord opened   the door, and the snow blew on the peo-  ple; and when I inquired the object of   having the door opened in a snow storm,   he informed me that he wanted some   light on the subject. I found that it was   the custom of the country.    How much good I did in that sermon   I never knew, and probably never shall   know until I meet that congregation in   judgment.    In the southern part of Missouri and   the northern part of Arkansas, in 1834,   there were but very few inhabitants.    We visited a place called Harmony   Mission, on the Osage River, one of the   most crooked rivers in the west. This   mission was kept by a Presbyterian min-  ister and his family.    We arrived there on Sunday night at   sunset. We had walked all day with   nothing to eat, and were very hungry   and tired. Neither the minister nor his   wife would give us anything to eat, nor   let us stay over night, because we were   Mormons, and the only chance we had   was to go twelve miles further down the   river, to an Osage Indian trading post,   kept by a Frenchman named Jereu.   And this wicked priest, who would not 
 the Constitution guarantee unto all her citizens alike. But  this we as a people have been denied from the beginning  Persecution has rolled upon our heads from time to time  from portions of the United States like peels of thunder  because of our religion and no portion of the Government  as yet has steped forward for our relief and under  view of these things I feel it to be my right and  privilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfully  in the United States for the protection of injured  inocence and if I loose my life in a good cause I  am willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue righteousness  and truth in maintaining the laws and Constitution of  the United States if need be for the general good of  mankind."    Many other interesting remarks were  made. He was followed by Elders Hyde and Taylor  and a unanimous vote was passed by the assembly   to support Joseph.    On the 20th I met in Council  in the morning with the Presidency and Twelve. Two  messengers arrived from the Pine Count^r^y with word  from Lyman Wight wanting counsel concerning preaching  to the Indians. Joseph thought it wisdom not  to do it and said that if Lyman Wight did it  he must do it upon his own responsibility and concluded  not to send him any counsel but to let him act  with the best wisdom he had.    Next day I again ^on the 21st of Feb^ met with the  quorum of the Twelve at Joseph's store and according  to Joseph's counsel we sellected a company to go  on an exploring expedition to California and select  a spot to build a city.

 and Elders Yerslay Emmett [ink changes] were named for that expedition    While we were holding this council the Rev D. Wolfe   an Episcopalian clergyman was preaching to  a congregation of Saints in the other room. When  he closed President Joseph Smith followed and among  other remarks he said    "Men may preach and practice everything  excepting that which God commands us to do and they  will be damned at last. We may tithe our 'rue'  'annis' and 'caummin' and still not obey the commandments  of God. The object with me is to obey and teach  others to obey God in just what He tells us to  do. It mattereth not whether the principle is popular  or unpopular I will always maintain a true  principle even if I stand alone in it."    On the evening of Sunday the 25  I met with the quorum and had an interesting time  We had received information concerning the death of  Joseph Duncon and Governor Reynolds of Missouri  who shot himself through the head. They were  two of the most inveterate enemies against the  Latter-day Saints. This called forth    A Notable Prophecy of Joseph    He prophesied that within five years we should  be rid of our old enemies whether they were apostates  or of the world and wished us to record it that  when it came to pass we nead not say we had   forgotton his saying.    By special appointment a large   assembly of Saints met on Thursday the 7th of March  for the purpose of advancing the progress of the

It is about time to draw our meeting to a   close, and before closing I would like to say a very few words:  Our attention has been drawn through the day to the travels of   the missionaries, which is all very well, but before closing I   wish to say to the people, I do not wish you to lose sight of the   duties of saints; I want to have the Latter Day Saints keep  in view the work in which they are engaged at home, and   not forget it. We are engaged in what is termed a reformation  here in Great Salt Lake City. There are missionaries sent  out through this City, who are sent out by the authorities to   labor amoung the people, and do them good.    I just wish to say to the brethren that I want to have you  be faithful, and look to the counsel we have received, and carry   it out. I want to have the Bishops and missionaries, when   they meet, unite themselves together in the spirit of the Lord. We do  not wish to hear of any difference between the Bishops and missionaries. 
 W. W. feel as tho wanted to say a few words. it has seemed  good for missioneries, to be called, but we have not  met associated with the Bishops. I stand connected with  you as a missionary—the coy—here should be the light  of the Lord, never felt more responsibility.

 [Column 1]  give us a piece of bread, lied to us about   the road, and sent us across the swamp,   and we wallowed knee-deep in mud and   water till ten o'clock at night in trying   to follow this crooked river. We then   left the swamp, and put out into the   prairie, to lie in the grass for the night.    When we came out of the swamp, we   heard an Indian drumming on a tin pail   and singing. It was very dark, but we   traveled towards the noise, and when we   drew near the Indian camp quite a num-  ber of large Indian dogs came out to   meet us. They smelt us, but did not   bark nor bite.    We were soon surrounded by Osage   Indians, and kindly received by Mr.   Jereu and his wife, who was an Indian.   She gave us an excellent supper and a   good bed, which we were thankful for   after the fatigue of the day.    As I laid my head upon my pillow, I   felt to thank God from the bottom of   my heart, for the exchange of the bar-  barous treatment of a civilized Presby-  terian priest for the humane, kind and   generous treatment of the savage Osage   Indians.    May God reward them both according   to their deserts.    We arose in the morning, after a good   night's rest. I was somewhat lame,   from wading in the swamp the night   before. We had a good breakfast. Mr.   Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the   river, and informed us that it was sixty   miles to the nearest settlement of either   white or red men.    We were too bashful to ask for any-  thing to take with us to eat; so we   crossed the river and started on our   day's journey of sixty miles without a   morsel of food of any kind.    We started about sunrise and crossed   a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level   as a house floor, without shrub or water.   We arrived at timber about two o'clock   in the afternoon. As we approached the   timber a large black bear came out   towards us. We were not afraid of him,   for we were on the Lord's business, and   had not mocked God's prophets as did   the forty-two wicked children who said   to Elisha "Go up thou bald head," for   which they were torn by bears. [##2 Kings 2:23-24##]    When the bear got within eight rods   of us he sat on his haunches and looked   at us a moment, and then ran away;    [Column 2]  and we went on our way rejoicing. We   had to travel in the night, which was   cloudy and very dark, so we had great   difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large   drove of wolves gathered around, and   followed us. They came very close, and   at times it seemed as though they would   eat us up.    We had materials for striking a light,   and at ten o'clock, not knowing where   we were, and the wolves becoming so   bold, we thought it wisdom to make a   fire; so we stopped and gathered a lot   of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and   lit them, and as our fire began to burn   the wolves left us.    As we were about to lay down on the   ground—for we had no blankets—we   heard a dog bark.    My companion said it was a wolf; I   said it was a dog: but soon we heard a   cow bell. Then we each took a fire-  brand and went about a quarter of a   mile, and found the house, which was   sixty miles from where we started that   morning.    It was an old log cabin, about twelve   feet square, with no door, but an old   blanket was hung up in the door-way.   There was no furniture except one bed-  stead, upon which lay a woman, several   children and several small dogs. A man   lay on the bare floor with his feet to the   fire-place, and all were asleep. I went   in and spoke to the man, but did not   wake him. I stepped to him, and laid   my hand on his shoulder. The moment   he felt the weight of my hand he jumped   to his feet, and ran around the room as   though he was frightened; but he was   quieted when we informed him we were   friends.    The cause of his fright was, he had   shot a panther a few nights before, and   he thought its mate had jumped upon   him.    He asked us what we wanted; we told   him we wished to stop with him all   night, and would like something to eat.   He informed us we might lay on the   floor as he did, but that he had not a   mouthful for us to eat, as he had to de-  pend on his gun to get breakfast for his   family in the morning. So we lay on   the bare floor, and slept through a long,   rainy night, which was pretty hard after   walking sixty miles without anything to

 Nov 23, 1856    3    The Missionaries are sent abroad in connection with the Bishops  to labor for the welfare of the people. The missionaries need  the Holy Spirit, and the Bishops and their Counselors need the   Holy Spirit that when we meet together one man need not  think because any ^other^ man is trmbling in his words he is above  him— and not let any feelings rise in our breast that,  one is greater than the other, and we must spend an hour to   know who is to preside: and when we meet in a ward, no matter  who opens the meeting, or who calls for singing; whoever does this,   let all unite with him.    He have been called upon by the President to reform our-  selves.    My feelings are like this, I want to keep this in view  before the people; let us all rise up and endeavor to lighten the  burden that is on the shoulders of these men: we can do it by  the aid of the spirit of God. ^As men who labor in Israel^ Our only object should be to  do the people good. As missionaries we should not think  that we have to pound, as with a sledge all the time.    I do hope as I am satisfied that there is a reformation;  people do begin to repent, they do feel the necessily of waking

Pratt and then Elder Young arose and observed that  the Patriarch was next and Hyrum came to the stand and  spoke to the assembly. He said    The object of this meeting is to stir  up your minds by way of remembrance. It is necessary  to have a starting point to build the Temple. With the  assistance of the sisters we expect to get the nails and  glass and with the assistance of the brethren we intend  to do the rest. I will proclaim in public and private  that the Sisters bought the glass and nails by penny  subscription. Choose ye this day whom ye  will serve!    We shall call upon this vast  multitude for a donation to buy powder and fuse rope  to blast the rocks in the quarry. We want the  brethren to do as much as the sisters. We do  not intend to finish the Nauvoo House this  season but to finish the Temple or the walls  of it this Summer get the roof on by December  and do the inside next winter and in about a  year from this Spring we will dedicate it  We can do anything we undertake We have  power and we can do great things    In five years to come the work  will progress more than it has in ten years of the   past.

We got up in the morning and walked   in the rain twelve miles to the house of   a man named Bemon, who was also one   of the mob from Jackson County. They   were about sitting down to breakfast as   we came in.    In those days it was the custom of the   Missourians to ask you to eat even if   they intended to cut your throat as soon   as you got through; so he asked us to   take breakfast, and we were very glad of   the invitation.    He knew we were Mormons; and as   soon as we began to eat he began to   swear about the Mormons. He had a   large platter of bacon and eggs, and   plenty of bread on the table, and his   swearing did not hinder our eating, for   the harder he swore the harder we ate,   until we got our stomachs full; then we   arose from the table, took our hats,   thanked him for our breakfast, and the   last we heard of him he was still swear-  ing.    I trust the Lord will reward him for   our breakfast.    In the early days of the Church, it   was a great treat to an Elder in his travels   through the country to find a Mormon;   it was so with us. We were hardly in   Arkansas when we heard of a family   named Akeman. They were in Jackson   County in the persecutions. Some of   the sons had been tied up there and   whipped on their bare backs with hickory   switches by the mob. We heard of their   living on Petit Jean River, in the Ar-  kansas Territory, and we went a long   way to visit them.    There had recently been heavy rains,   and a creek that we had to cross was   swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods   in width. There was no person living   nearer than two miles from the crossing,   and no boat. The people living at the   last house on the road, some three miles   from the crossing, said we would have to   tarry till the water fell before we could   cross. We did not stop, feeling to trust   in God.    Just as we arrived at the rolling flood   a negro, on a powerful horse, entered    [Column 2]  the stream on the opposite side and rode   through it. On our making our wants   known to him, he took us, one at a time,   behind him and carried us safely over,   and we went on our way rejoicing.    We arrived that night within five   miles of Mr. Akeman's, and were kindly   entertained by a stranger. During the   night I had the following dream:    I thought an angel came to us, and   told us we were commanded of the Lord   to follow a certain straight path, which   was pointed out to us, let it lead us   wherever it might. After we had walked   in it awhile we came to the door of a   house, which was in the line of a high   wall running north and south, so that we   could not go around. I opened the door   and saw the room was filled with large   serpents, and I shuddered at the sight.   My companion said he would not go   into the room for fear of the serpents.   I told him I should try to go through the   room though they killed me, for the   Lord had commanded it. As I stepped   into the room the serpents coiled them-  selves up, and raised their heads some   two feet from the floor, to spring at me.   There was one much larger than the rest   in the centre of the room, which raised   his head nearly as high as mine and   made a spring at me. At that instant I   felt as though nothing but the power of   God could save me, and I stood still.   Just before the serpent reached me he   dropped dead at my feet; all the rest   dropped dead, swelled up, turned black,   burst open, took fire and were consumed   before my eyes, and we went through   the room unharmed, and thanked God   for our deliverance.    I awoke in the morning and pondered   upon the dream. We took breakfast,   and started on our journey on Sunday   morning, to visit Mr. Akeman. I re-  lated to my companion my dream, and   told him we should see something strange.   We had great anticipations of meeting   Mr. Akeman, supposing him to be a   member of the Church. When we ar-  rived at his house he received us very   coldly, and we soon found that he had   apostatized. He brought railing accusa-  tions against the Book of Mormon and   the authorities of the Church.    Word was sent through all the settle-  ments on the river for twenty miles that   two Mormon preachers were in the place.

Wherein there is any thing for us to make right  let us never cease until that is done. Let us get the Holy  Spirit and carry it with us wherever we go, that we may be  guided any governed by that spirit, and when we do this  no matter in what capacity we labor, there will be a   good influence felt; The people will feel that we can do them  good, they will feel that our only object is to [soley] to benefit  them. Let the missionaries and bishops be united in the   spirit of God when they meet, and let their only object be  to benefit the people; let every man unite, and pray all  the time that these men may have the spirit of God, and   gift of the Holy Ghost.    There is room yet for us to reform  and obtain more of the spirit of the Lord. 
 W- W-  our object in getting up the cahehism   is not to expose but save men - let the   missionaries catechise a man privately, especially  if heben guilty of groper sins -   I would recommend that no man be catchise  before his family - if guilty of adultery   make a record of it , tell no man but   Pres.

Not   glad to see so little feeling manifested between  the Bishops & missionars - I now have   had difficulty in going where even a deacon   presides, if Bishops not improper, I find it   best to be wise & try to save a man if  his heart is honest, I would not raise up again   a Bishop but backwater to save man.  have   acknowledged wrong, when I was right, I go &    
 5    I do know there is a burden upon the President of   this Church like the cart pressing on the wheel. I do feel   that we should use up and help to carry off their burden,   by getting the spirit of the Lord. When we get that  we can take off a mighty load.

The Prophet arrived and took the Stand  and arose in the midst of the congregation and said  "Orson Pratt, come and take your Place" and  then continued:    "I do not know whether the object of  the meeting has been told or not. I apologize for  not coming sooner.    I have had so much on my  mind since I saw you that I hardly know where  to begin; but one of the grand objects which I had  in view in calling this meeting was to make a  few remarks relative to the laws and ordinances  and the building of the Temple.    The reason I want to speak of  the laws is that the officers have difficulties in  administering the laws. We are republican and  wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness.  Some would complain with what God Himself would  do. The laws are enacted by petition and they  can be repealed if they wish it but the people  ought not to complain of the officers but complain  of the lawmakers.    I am instructed by the City  Council to tell this people that if you do not like  any law which we have passed we will repeal it  for we are your servants. If any complain of  our rights and charters it is because they are wicked.  The Devil is in them.    The reason I call this up is  we have a simple gang of fellows who do not  know where their head or elbows are. If you preach

 Remarks of Elder W Woodruff on Judge Stiles Trial befor  the Seventies Council, held at Seventies Council Hall, Decr 22, 1856    Br Woodruff arose, and said, Judge Stiles, a woman  came out of the Tabernacle and confessed she had in-  tercourse with you. Another says, she has seen you  have intercourse with a woman, and can you say  you have not had intercourse with this woman.  We want you to confess it. We do not want you  to tell a lie before God, men, holy Angels, and the  devil for if you lie the Judgments of God  will fall upon you. 
 W. Woodruff. I realize our missionary meetings in one  sense of the word are the most uninteresting of any we hold in  the city; but they are very necessary. I will explain myself.  We have to sit here from six o'clock to nine to hear these  reports; a man merely has to give a very short item of the State  of his ward things in his ward: but nevertheless it seems to be 
 Elder Woodruffs Speech delivered at a Council of  the Seventies held at the Seventies Council Hall, Decr 22nd, 1856    Elder Woodruff rose and declared, that, he lived as long as   he will, and see iniquity and not rebuke it, and his feelings he declard  unto God and the Holy Ghost. Who does not know that Judge Stiles has  lied against God, the Holy Ghost, the holy Angels and these his Brethren.  The women have acknowledged the crimes they were guilty of, and have in  some measure redeemed themselves. He wanted to say to these Brethren  that were round him; these Presidents of Seventies; that, it was time  we rose up and rebuked sin. The time has come when the Seventies  should get the gift and power of the Holy Ghost for God requires that  they rise up and get rid of these adulterers and adultresses. He had  learned too much of the gift of God and the power of the Holy Ghost, &  say a man was not guilty when he was. We had now got to stand  up in defense of the principles of truth. Let Br Jedediah who has spoken  and warned these Presidents bear witness that, if we do not wake up,  the Judgments of God will be upon us. He loved these Presidents. Br   Pulsipher was the first man he heard preach the Gospel. He had baptized   him and ordained him a teacher. He wanted to see him wake up, also  these Presidents. There was a great responsibility resting upon them. He   addressing them, ^he^ saying^id^ Rise up my Brethren in the majesty of your calling;  then, when any man speaks, you may know whether he has the Spirit and 
 6    necessary that we do meet. I name this because I do   not want the brethren to be discouraged. In another sense  it is not uninteresting to know the feelings in the minds of   the Saints, but there is a sameness. I hope that sameness  will all be by & bye of the best kind.    I have a few items that I want to speak of, that  I have taken as I passed along. The first is what Brother  Haven said with regard to catechising the people by   those ^in^ families. I would prefer to adopt a unifaorm system in  this we go into a family and ask the man; he has half a dozen  wives and twenty children: you ask that man, are you willing  to be catechised together. The man feeling perhaps that he has  not done anything he is afraid to have his wives know: perhaps  one of his wives may be guilty of adultery, or stealing, and the  rest of the family not guilty. The moment that woman says  she wants to be catechised alone, the whole of the rest of the family  are suspicious of it. You will all see that you go into a  family, a woman has been guilty of committing adultery It  may be the moment that man knows that it is a dagger 
 virtue to them they will oppose it. If you preach the Methodist  God to them they will oppose that also ore anything else and  if there is any case tried they want it appealed to Carthage.  Mr Boswicks case had to go there. Our lawyers will  send anything to Carthage.    I want to know if the citizens will  sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven for the  people. I will arraign the person before the people  who acts against the interest of the city and I shall have  the voice of the people which is republican and as likely  to be the voice of God.    As long as I have a tongue to speak  I will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wicked  men. I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling over  of Hell nor its thunders and forked lightning.    I despise the man who will betray   you with a kiss. Here is Hyrum Kimball. He has  set at naught the ordinances of the city by saying that  he owns the warf, and steamboats need not pay them.  Wherefore? This body is the highest court. What  appeal to Carthage? I would not appeal there if I  died a thousand deaths. Neither Kimball nor  Morrison owns the warfage. Water street runs  along the beach and belongs to the city and not individuals.    I will reprove the lawyers and  doctors. Jesus did and every prophet has and if   I am a prophet I shall also do it. At any rate  I shall do it for I profess to be a Prophet.    The laws and Constitution of the   United States have ceded the right to corporated cities   to regulate all warfage of shiping and steamboats &c  All laws of taxation are subject to the city and not   to individuals; and I want from this time forth 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  A mob was soon raised, and warning   sent to us to leave immediately or we   would be tarred and feathered, ridden   on a rail and hanged. I soon saw where   the serpents were. My companion wanted   to leave; I told him no, I would stay   and see my dream fulfilled.    There was an old gentleman and lady,   named Hubbel, who had read the Book   of Mormon and believed. Father Hub-  bel came to see us, and invited us to   make our home with him while we stayed   in the place. We did so, and labored   for him some three weeks with our axes,   clearing land, while we were waiting to   see the salvation of God.    I was commanded of the Lord by the   Holy Ghost to go and warn Mr. Ake-  man to repent of his wickedness. I did   so, and each time he railed against me,   and the last time he ordered me out of   his house. When I went out he followed   me and was very angry. When he came   up to me, about eight rods from the   house, he fell dead at my feet, turned   black and swelled up, as I saw the ser-  pents do in my dream.    His family, as well as ourselves, felt it   was the judgment of God upon him. I   preached his funeral sermon. Many of   the mob died suddenly. We stayed   about two weeks after Akeman's death   and preached, baptized Mr. Hubbel and   his wife, and then continued on our   journey.    We concluded to go down Arkansas   River and cross into Tennessee. We   could not get passage on the boat, be-  cause of the low water, so we went on   the bank of the river and cut down a sound   cottonwood tree, three feet through, and   cut off a twelve-foot length from the   butt end ; and in two days we dug out a   canoe. We made a pair of oars and a   rudder, and on the 11th of March, 1835,   we launched our canoe, and commenced   our voyage down the Arkansas River,   without provisions.    The first day we sailed twenty-five   miles, and stopped at night with a poor   family who lived on the bank of the   river. These kind folks gave us supper   and breakfast, and, in the morning, gave   us a johnny-cake and a piece of pork to   take with us on our journey.    We traveled about fifty miles that day,   and at night stopped at an old tavern, in   a village called Cadron, which was de-    [Column 2]  serted because it was believed to be   haunted by evil spirits.    We made a fire in the tavern, roasted   a piece of our pork, ate our supper, said   our prayers, went into a chamber, lay   down on the bare floor, and were soon  asleep.    I dreamed I was at my father's house   in a good feather bed, and I had a good   night's rest. When I awoke the bed   vanished, and I found myself on the bare   floor and well rested, not having been   troubled with evil spirits or anything   else.    We thanked the Lord for His good-  ness to us, ate the remainder of our pro-  visions and continued our journey down   the river to Little Rock, the capital of   Arkansas, which then consisted of only   a few cabins.    After visiting the place, we crossed   the river and tied up our canoe, which   had carried us safely one hundred and   fifty miles.    We then took the old military road,   leading from Little Rock to Memphis,   Tennessee. This road lay through   swamps, and was covered with mud and   water most of the way, for one hundred   and seventy miles. We walked forty   miles in a day through mud and water   knee-deep.    On the 24th of March, after traveling   some ten miles through mud, I was taken   lame with a sharp pain in my knee, I   sat down on a log.    My companion, who was anxious to   get to his home in Kirtland, left me sit-  ting in an alligator swamp. I did not   see him again for two years. I knelt   down in the mud and prayed, and the   Lord healed me, and I went on my way   rejoicing.    On the 27th of March, I arrived at   Memphis, weary and hungry. I went to   the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr.   Josiah Jackson. I told him I was a   stranger and had no money. I asked   him if he would keep me over night.    He inquired of me what my business   was.    I told him I was a preacher of the   gospel.    He laughed and said that I did not   look much like a preacher.    I did not blame him, as all the   preachers he had ever been acquainted   with rode on fine horses or in fine car- 
 and power of God on him or not. When a man rises up to cover his  sins, there is no salvation there. He for one would be true to those  men who lead him if it cost him his life. He wanted to take off  the incubus that had been resting so long upon his Brethren the  Presidency. He was glad Br Hyde and the Twelve were he[re],   for they would search Zion as with a lighted candle. There w ais  a perfect stream of corruption coming up constantly, and if God  and his servants wanted friends to assist them it was day. He   called upon his Brethren of the Twelve and the Seventies to stand  as a Bulwark between the Presidency and the Church of God. Men  have betrayed women, and if men and women commit whore-  doms, he would say let somebody draw the sword, and let them  go to hell. If these Brethren will take hold as Quorums, and   as the heart of one man we will sustain ourselves.    (2 Speech of) Elder Woodruff wanted to back up those things  spoken by Br Richards for the Lord knows it they are true. He  wanted the Brethren to call their Quorums together, and  take the Catechism and weigh their Quorums by that Catechism  and root out from their Quorums the iniquity that was among  them. He loved the Presidents of these Quorums.  What Br Richards said was true. The Twelve Apostles had  got to wake up, and if these Brethren do not wake up, they   will be removed. He thanked God that his Brethren of the

Salt Lake City, Utah, [blank] 189    Terre-haute Oct. 18, 1838; Franklin,   born March 12, 1816, died June 1;   Newton, born June 19, 1818, drowned   Sept. 1820; Julius, born April 22,   1820, died in infancy; Eunice,   born June 19, 1821. I married   her to Dwight Webster, in Farmington,  Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.    My father at 18 worked in a flouring   & saw mill, and continued about 50 years,   laboring 18 hours a day most of the time.    I baptized him and all his house-  hold into the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter day Saints July 1, 1838.   He was very honest & very charitable,   freely loaning ^to neighbors,^ or giving to the poor,  always saying yes to those who asked a   favor.    I was born in north part of   Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford   county, Conn. March 1, 1804. I   worked with my father till 20 years old.   In April 1827 I took the flouring mill of 
 7    to his heart all the days of his life: just so with a woman  let her know that her husband has been guilty of adultery.  Don't you see you destroy families the moment you pursue  that course. We can all see the wisdom of taking them  indivually to catechise them. The more I see the operation of  it:, the more I see the wisdom of it, and then we do not create  any suspicion.    Again I want to say; in the organization of this  missionary operation; we have not organized the missionaries  for the whole Territory, although some of the missionaries did  go out. We have not to the present day organized the missionaries  abroad, so that we do not feel that there is any use censure  to any of the Brethren abroad, because they have not been  counselld to do it.    Again concering the remarks that Bro  (Geo. D.) Grant made with regard to the 11th & 12th wards I feel  satisfied with it, to let those Bishops, if they desire to take it   upon themselves, that they should go and catechise their   wards; and if the Bishops feel disposed to liberate the   missionaries from that. Those Bishops are qualified; to know ^but when^ 
 Quorum of the Twelve were with him. He felt to tremble  when he considered that these ^were^ Forty Quorums of Seventys  here, and these Presidents can't get power enough to   trim them up. The powers of the Kingdom of Heaven  are ready, and we cannot stand any longer in the way  of the rolling of the Ark of the Kingdom of God. Joseph  and Hyrum, and David and Jedde, and a host of   others are at our back and ready for us, and if he  could do any thing, he would do it if it cost him his  life. Let all your Quorums work and fast and  pray until they get the Spirit of God. We, of the   Twelve are willing to be with you; also Br Hyde with his   fan in his hand and we will kindle a fire here.    These ^Brethren of^ Presidents Breth have not got the spirit of their  Apostleship upon them. They should rise up, or go to  Br Brigham, and make their feelings known to him  in this matter. He was glad to meet them here to night.  Go to battle either spiritually or temporally.    Dont sleep under this matter. Visit every tree planted in   your Quorum, and God will bless you, and dont be afraid  and he will be with you with his free spirit which is   my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 
 8    anything is revealed to them they should not reveal it to   any man, and if it is any thing that they do not feel ^able^ to handle  let them bring it to us, and if we can't handle it, we will  take it to President Young. I feel to impress that upon the   minds of the brethren, when a matter is revealed to you, never  reveal it to any mortal man again.    There is another subject; concerning these relief societies;  now President Young recommended these female relief societies:  that the societies should take    I have not heard of much being done with regard to it.  The 14th ward organized that society, and it is a great relief to the   Bishop poor. They have sustained the poor; they have taken  every case from the hands of the Bishop: as the poor have come  in they have gone to this society. The sisters get together and  make up their quilts and clothing, and appropriate a little  without feeling it much. I thought I would name this to  the missionaries: It would be a good plan for them to keep  this in mind, it may probably do some good--good will grows  out of it. 
 9    Another thing was on any mind with regard to the wards  where they are so scattered crowded. weI waent into the Seventies  but they were three tier deep through, as full as people can be; it  is so in many of the wards, and many of the ward have to   go home. My feelings have been, if I could manage it I   would have male and female meetings, and block meetings;  or take a part of the ward, and give the people the privilege,   for every Thursday have the ward as to leave or crowd in till  the house is filled to Suffocation. The Bishop in Provo, it  was in the beginning. He told them the time would come  when a seat in this House will be an item here in Provo. They  have seen that day, and after the have a house full, and  let the people out, there is another congregation ready to rush  into it; and it is so in many other places. We should  try to do something for the relief of the people, and I would  recommend that you change those meetings so that they can all  get out to some meeting. These were about the items I wanted  to name.    With regard to the law of consecration as that subject 
 10    came up--the law of consecration; there is no law upon it;  when President Young took that subject up there was no  commandment; he did not require it unless the people  felt disposed to do it; but it is one of the first laws, God  revealed. He called upon them to consecrate their all in   the Kingdom of God. The Twelve and leading men of this  Church and Kingdom counted it a glorious blessing to walk  up and consecrate all that they haved. If I could put into  it my wives and children I would have done it. I should have  put every thing I could think of, and if the Lords wants  anything we have, it is all right. If this people really   understand what their privileges are, there is not one of youthem   but what would desire to consecrate all youthey have, because   it is one of the first laws of God. A great many of the   people have gone forward and done it. This is all I want   to say upon this matter. Some of the Brethren would tell about  the reformation among the Children. I would like to say, we are  little children, and should be humble, and be capable to be something  that will do some good. 
 11    I want to say when people turn their attention from  loafering, and turn their attention to something that will  bring some good to pass; ^from^ that moment they donot feel  they could throw away one solitary moment, if they only  had the spirit of the most High God upon them, to see what  they were made for: and we as priests, apostles, and Elders,  take us as a body, if our lives eyes had been opened as they are  now in a measure there is not one of us but what would feel  we have no time to spend in folly and nonsense, but to bring  about all the good we can. I remember a remark Joseph  made, said he Be artful here, in speaking of the endownments,   you should go to work and use your privileges, and not spend  a whole life, and get no blessing sealed upon you; watch every  nook and corner where you can get a blessing sealed upon   you. Let us as missionaries--our work is not done we  have only just begun. A remark was made with regard  to taking care of the oil and wine, and alluding to saving every  body that can be saved; and with regard to people confessing 
 12    their sins: what does it do? It opens the field, and shows   to us something that we never saw, and hardly expected to see;  this shows a scenery of things to us. What are we going to   do? We are going to try to save every body that can be saved.  There is no man but what has failed somewhere; you can  hardly find a man in all Israel, but you put him in the  scale and he will righteously way up every where. We have  all been subject to temptation; we have had a failing heare, and   another there, and we have all, the very best of us, done things  in our life we have been sorry for, and had it not been for the  temptation we never would have done it. There are a great  many men in Israel, that have done this thing that was wrong,  and they are good men and women, and have been overcome  in a moment of temptation. If we were to go to work, and   destroy every body that has done wrong you would have nobody  to be saved. The idea is, as long as the Lord says, we will  forgive this people. The President, who holds the keys, says, I   will forgive this people; we will do just so too, as long as we 
 13    see the people willing to repent, but I do want the missionaries  to impress this one thing upon men who confess heinous sins:  they should not be so lightly passed over that they do not  have any feeling about time it; if they have not had the  weight upon them so that they have had a godly sorrow, they   should have something to make them; they should have a   a repentance that will not be repented of, and that the Almighty  will give him the Holy Spirit. When we meet with people that  are willing to forsake their sins, we should be very careful of them  and try to save them. I go in for this principle to save the  people. You have gone to work here in the City of Salt Lake as  a body of saviors in Mount Zion. Well now, no doubt but you  have been instruments in the hands of God of freeing the hearts  of a great many. You will find men & women that are still  committing Adultery, and the devil holds that up to them all  the time & tells them that they cannot do anything: the devil  takes that advantage, the missionaries should strike that  down, and tell them to tell the devil to go away and let  them forsake their sins, and rise up and get the spirit, and let 
 15    that are not willing, but go right into the corn you wlill   see they will go by the board.    There is one thing that is a consolation to me it is   the officers in the Church and Kingdom; that is their element,  universally, get hold of this spirit and see the necessity  of being saved. You will see a few men that will cover  in a measure their sin; you will see a few that do not see  the importance of it. The majority of this people are   beginning to feel the importance of it; how different the   element was when you first began in your wards: how   different it is with me when I go among the Seventies and  High Priests, it seemed as if I wanted to call upon twenty  men to lift the roof off the house, it is not so now, we donot  find the same element we did a few months ago. The people  are beginning to feel the spirit; the Bishops, Missionaries, and   all are beginning to feel it, & When you go to a man or   woman full of faith in that you can do them good. We should  all try to do one another good. I feel as though you will see the 
 156    fruits of your labors. I do not believe you will see this  Kingdom settle back and go to sleep; if it does we may  take our knapsacks, and go into the wilderness. The  Lord will not wait upon this people any longer if they go  to sleep again, you will see judgement laid right straight  to the line, and justice will walk up, and mercy will stand  right back; this is the way I feel about it, and I do feel the   missionaries will should impress it upon every man either in   this Territory or abroad. If you will see a man that will  confess his sins, and ^he^ should feel impression upon him that  that must be the last time, if he does not, he will inherit sorrow  unto himself, that he will not get right off as easily as he has.  Men have gone and said, wYou are forgiving all manner of sin  except the sin against the Holy Ghost. Says I so do I, and the  Lord says he will too. No man will get right rid of paying  for his sins, I never commited a sin in my life but what costs  me more, ten times more than it was worth; every man has to  pay for his sins; there is no trifling with them. The Lord in 
 17    mercy has come out and told us from the heavens, with the   voice of the prophet, I will forgive your sins, they shall  not be brought against you any more. What more does   a people ask for. Give them to understand if they are  ever catechised hereafter it will be from the winter of  1856-[185]7, and if they commit sins hereafter they will be   brought to judgement, and it will be laid to the line, &  there will not be the mercy that is now shown.    Well, I pray that God may bless you, and may   bless us all, and fill us with revelation, with the Holy Spirit  of God. Go into a ward and the spirit of God will  reveal every thing that is around you. If a man lies to you  you should know it, it is your privilege so to do.

 Salt Lake City Utah  February 1, 1888    President Woodruff    Dear Brother    I take the liberty of enclosing my reply to  the letter of Bro Jacob F. Gates which you mentioned,   with the respectful wish that as Bro Gates' letter was  read before you and the brethren my reply may be  likewise honored.    I may be asking too much of you ^in^ consideration of  your perils and inconveniences, to request another interview,  before you decide on what action you take on this important   matter, and I would not ask it for myself, but the  magnitude of the interest involved constrains me, and  that I may leave no exertion unused I do ask for the  privilege of seeing you or any of the brethren you may  suggest that I may have further opportunity of laying before  you the values of this industry.    Very respectfully    Arthur Stayner

 Salt Lake City Utah    January 24th 1888    Prest Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    It doubtless will appear to you that I am  impertinate but I feel constrained to plead with  you for a personal interview. The magnitude of the interests  involved in the business I am laboring with, and the  prestige & power which will inevitably follow the establishment  of the business are considerations worthy of reflection before  they have passed into [cinnical] hands and it is too late to  recover them.    Will you Bro Woodruff let me see you and Counsellors  to obtain some counsel upon this important enterprise. Time  is passing along will you please let me see you soon.    Very respectfully Your Brother    Arthur Stayner 
 Salt Lake City    Oct 21, 1887    Prest Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    Many thanks for your prompt, candid, and  kind reply of even date herewith.    I appreciate to some extent the emergency of  your situation and would not have intruded this  matter upon you at this time had it not been for  my desire to give you the first opportunity of control,  and the booming pressure likely to be made from the  outside rendered prompt action apparently necessary  aupon our part. The nature of your reply was  not unanticipated by me, and as you kindly say  a business which bids fair to be so remunera-  tive should not long go a begging amongst  our people. To make the benefits apparent  to men of means and enterprise should not be   the greatest of the difficulties. I have had to

 grapple with in my late experiences, although  I recognize the fact that the class of ability  necessary for that is considerably different from  that which is necessary to bear the physical  burthen of effort, and disappointment, and to  bring forward the energy and determination  requisite in bringing to a successful degree of  profitable output a great industry.    With very kind and respectful regards    I remain Your Brother    Arthur Stayner.    [sideways text] Arthur [Stainie]  Oct 21st [18]87 [end of sideways text]

 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met at  Father Cornors & held three meetings through the day and evening  we red in the Book of Mormon, broke bread to the  Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bare testimony to  me that there would be a great work in London  We retired to rest in good season. I felt well in  my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night  I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untill  about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a determina-  tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome  the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by  day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming  this determination in my own mind a personage appeared  unto me which I considered was the prince of darkess  darkness or the Devil, he made war with me and attempted  to take my life he laid hold of me like a strong  armed man, I felt like the wait of a heavy man  lying upon my body and he caught me by the throat  with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death  I struggled with him as one man would struggled  with another I, felt as though this destroyer would overcom  me & that I must die as I saw no way that I could  escape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me  why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help, I then  asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver  me from the power of the Devil & preserve my life  instantly three personages came throught the door dressed  in white with considerable light surrounding them they  came up to the bed side while I was lying in the grasp  of the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & in  the twinkling of an eye I was liberated & the spirit of God  vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls  of my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a high  state of persperation water stood upon ^me^ in drops. As soon  as I could speak I spoke to Brother G. A. Smith &  I found that he had been labering under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been  seeking his life as well as my own, and he was  delivered in the same way. the three personages that  appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think  over sisx feet the other m[i]dd[l]e one was another man was  medium size & the 3rd was a short man they we[r]e all clothed  alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but  as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was  delivered they disappeared, I felt thankful to God for  the presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage record this  in one of the blank pages & refer to the page)  Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and many  other Saints I attended a discussion in the evening held  at the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester. One Mr  Barrett had tried hard for a length of time to get  some of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him, though  his continued teazing [president] Brigham Young told him  the Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject with  him but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonism  he would appo[in]t some body to meet him, as Mr Barrytt  would not take no for an answer Brother Alfred Cordon  was appo[in]ted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was  a beardless boy yet he had been ordained an Elder &  received much of the Spirit of the Lord and they met  for this purpose at early candle light, the Stand was  occupied on one side by my Methodist Priest, & on the  other side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lyted  by 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighthed with  gass there were some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-  self to prove th Book of Mormon false & water baptism  ^not^ essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged  himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & water  baptism essential to Salvation.  As Mr Barrytt arose  & declyaired to the Assembly that he would prove the Book of  Mormon false & water baptism not essential to  Salvation 4 glass chimneys in each of the chanderliers burst 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the Congregation  And the man who had tended the gass in the Hall said  for twenty years said he had never known  any [wei[r]der] of the kind. the chimneys were replaced  & the discussions went on I set by the side of Doctor  W Richards, and at the commencement of the meeting  a very interesting old gentleman appeared in the congrega  -tion he sat at the end of a seat joing the ally near  the platform, He made me think of what he s is said of  the Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & rested  in a large white roll upon his shoulders, he was a noble  looking man he eyed us with great interest &  penetration, he occupied his seat to our view then  some half an hour I called the attention of Doctor  Richards to him we both looked at him with feelings  of both interest, some little disturbance in another part  of the Home attracted our attention & when we  returned our eyes to the seat of our interesting visitor  we found his seat vacant, & he had disappeared  there for the first time we felt that we had been  visited by John the Revelator or one of the three  Ancient Nephite, however the discussion went on  Mr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordon greived  the victory, & quite a number of the methodist who   attended that discussion, was baptized & joined the Latter  Day Saints 
 Autobiography of Wilford Woodruff    The remaining months of  the year 1841 was spent by the  Twelve, after their return from  this successful mission in G  to Great Britain, in settling  their families in Nauvoo and  taking charge of the affairs of  the affairs Church. Several  noteworthy events took place at this  time among which were the  dedication of the baptismal font  in the Temple by the Prophet and  the Twelve and the first adminis-  trations of the ordinance of 
 baptism for the dead, both of  which occurred on Sunday Nov 21st,  1841. A large congregation  assembled and Elders Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball and  John Taylor baptized about forty  and persons and Elders Willard  Richards, George A Smith and  Wilford Woodruff confirmed them.    During the following week  a company of about 200 Saints  arrived from England, and I was  now again in the midst of  hundreds whom I had baptized  in America, the "Islands of the Sea"  and England and Wales. 
 Just before the April Conference  the Prophet administered the  ordinance of rebaptism to the  Church, baptizing many himself,  among whom were the Twelve,  who afterwards assisted him  in baptizing and confirming  the multitude. This was the  first time I was rebaptized. At  since my [ent] the Prophet  Joseph administered  the close of the administration  the Prophet lifted up his hands  to heaven and blessed the   people and the Spirit of 
 God rested upon the congregation    At the April Conference  there were 275 ordained to  the office ^under the hands^ of Elders, Brigham  Young, Heber C Kimball,  Orson Pratt, Lyman Wight,  Willard Richards, George A  Smith and Wilford Woodruff.  offi While these ordinations were  going on Elder John Taylor was  in the stand delivering a  discourse to the multitude,  while others of the Elders were  baptizing and confirming  at the font and elsewhere. 
 afterwards this was done by the power of God  and not of man. We laid hands upon twenty  in Manchester who were sick and they were ^mostly^ healed  On the 21 I arrived in Burslem by coach and  met for the first time with Elder Alfred Cordon  This being my field of labor I stoped and commenced  work Elder Turly stoped in the pottery District  some 8 days then went to Birmingham his field of  labor in preaching baptizing bonfirming & blessing children  I received a letter on the 10 Feb from Elder John  Taylor at Liverpool saying they had commenced there and  baptized 10 person, I labored in the Staffordshire  potteries in Burslem, Hanly Stoke Lane End and  several other villages from the 22 Jan untill the  2nd day of March one month & 7 days preaching  ery night in the week and two or 3 times on the   Sabbath I baptized, confirmed, & blessed many children  and we had a good field open for labor  and many were believing, and it appeared as though  we had a door open to bring many into the Church  in that part of the vineyard 
 On the 23 of July I started  for St Louis to purchase a stock  of paper for the "Times & Seasons"  and arrived at St Louis on  the 2nd of August after a very  uncomfortable voyage during  which I took a very severe  cold which settled into bilious  fever.    See book marks 3 
 March 1, 1840 was my birth day I being 33  years of age. It being on Sunday I preached  twice through the day to a large assembly in the  City Hall in the Town of Hanly and broke bread  unto the Saints again in the evening I ^again^ met with a  large assemble of the Saints and strangers and while  singing the first Hymn the spirit of the Lord rested upon  me and the voice of the Lord said to me this is the   last meeting that you will hold with this people  for many ^days^ I was asstonished at this as I had many  appointments out in that district, when I arose to  speak to the people I told them that it was the  last meeting I should hold with them for many days  they were as much asstonished as I was In the  at the close of the meeting several four came forward  for baptism and we went down into the watter &   baptized them. In the morning I went in secret  before the Lord and asked him what his will was  concerning me and the ownly answer I got was to  go to the South for the Lord had a great work for  me to perform there as many souls were there waiting  for the word of the Lord 
 Chapter 6. My journey to Herefordshire. Interviewed  with John Benbow. The word of the Lord fulfilled  to me. The greatest gathering into the Church known among the  Gentiles since the organization of the Church in this  despensation    On the 3rd of March 1840 in fulfillment of the word  of the Lord to me I took coach & rode to Wolverham-  pton 26 miles & spent the night on the morning of the  4 I again took coach & rode through Dudley   Stourbridge, Kideministon, Stourport, and  Worcester and then walked a number of miles to  Mr John Benbows, Hill Farme, Castle Froome,  Ledbury Hereforshire Mr Benbow this was in  the South of England a farming country, a region  where No Morm Elder of the Latter Day Saints had  visited, I found Mr Benbow a wealthy farmer cultivating  300 acres of land, occupying a good mansion and a plenty  of means. His wife Jane had no children, I presented my-  self to them as a missionary from America an Elder  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been  sent to him by the commandment of God as a messenger  of Salvation to preach the Gospel of Life & Salvation 
 unto him and his houshold and the Inhabitants of  the land. Mr Benbow & his wife wife received me with  glad hearts and thanksgiving, it was in the evening when  I arrived having traveled during the day 48 mils by coach &  on foot, but after receiving refreshments we sat down  together & conversed untill two oclock in the morning, Br  & Sister Benbow rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings of  great joy which I brought unto them of the fullness  of the Everlasting Gospel which God had revealed through  the mouth of his prophet Joseph Smith in these  last days, and I rejoiced greatly at the joyful news  that BMr Benbow gave me, that I was standing in the  midst of a company of men & women over 600 in  Number who had broaken of[f] from the Wesleyan  Methodist and taken the name of United Brethren  Had 45 preachers as ^among^ their number, had Chapels &  many Homes licensed according theto the Law of the land  for preaching in, and this Body of United Brethren were   searching for light and truth but had gone as far  as they could, and were earnistly ^earnestly^ calling upon the  Lord to open the way before them, and send them  light and knowledge that they might know the true 
 way to be saved, when I learned these things I could  clearly see why the Lord had commanded me while  in the town of Hanly to leave that field of labor  and go to the South, for I could could clearly  see in Herefordshire a great harvest field for  gathering many saints into the Kingdom of God, I retired  to my bed with joy & rejoicing after offering my prayer  & thanksgiving to God, & slept sweetly until the  rising of the Sun; I arose in the morning of the 5th took breakfast  and told Mr Benbow I would like to commence my  Masters business by preaching the Gospel to the people  He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed  for preaching, and he sent word through the Neighborhood  that an American Missionary would preach at his home  that evening, the time came, many of the Neighbors came in  & I preached my first Gospel sermon in ^his home^ the home. I also  preached on the following evening March 6, at his home  and baptized 6 persons including Mr John Benbow  & wife 4 of four of the six were preachers of the United  Order ^Brethren^, I spent most of the following day in clean  cleaning out a nice pool of water and prepared it  for baptizing in as I saw many were to be baptized 
 there. ^I afterwards baptized 600 in this pool of water^ On Sunday the 8, I preached at Frooms Hill  in the morning, at Standly Hill in the afternoon  and at John Benbows Hill farm in the evening. It was  a remarkable incident that the parrish Church that  stood in the Neiborhood of Br Benbow and occupied  by the rector of the parrish had but 15 persons  attended his Church during the day while I had a large  congregation judged to be a thousand attended my  meetings through the day & evening, and as I arose in  the evening to speak at John Benbows house a man  entered the door and approached me and informed me  he was a constable sent by the rector of the parrish  with a warrant to arest me I asked him for what  crime, he said for preaching to the people, I told him  I had a license for the preaching ^of^ the Gospel to the people  as well as the rector, and if he would take a chair  I would wait upon him after meeting, he took my  chair & sat beside of me, I preached the first  principles of the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel for  an hour & a quarter the power of God rested upon me  the spirit of God filled the home the people were convinced  at the close of the meeting I opened a door for 
 baptism seven offered themselves, 4four were preachers, among   the number ^offered^ offered for baptism was the constable. He arose &  said Mr Woodruff I would like to be baptized, I told   him I would like to to baptize him, I went down   to the pool & baptized the seven we then met together   and I confirmed thirteen, & broak bread unto the   Saints and we all rejoiced together. The constable went  to the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr   Woodruff taken up for preaching the Gospel he must go   himself and serve the writ, for he had ^heard^ her him   preach the ownly true gospel sermon he had ever   heard in his life. The rector did not know what   to make of it, and he sent two clerks of the   Church of England ads ^as^ spies to attend our meeting   to see what we did preach but they were both   pricked in their hearts, and received the word of God   gladly & were baptized and confirmed members of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the   rector became alarmed & dare not send any body   ^els^ but the Ministers & rectors of the Church of England  of the South of England called a convention and sent   a petition to the Lord Bishop of Canterbury to petition  parliment to pass a Law to prohibit the Mormons 
 [page covered] [fr]om preaching in the British dominions in this   [p]etition the rector stated that one Mormon  American Missionary [had] baptized fifteen hundred   mostly members of the English Church during the last   seven months, but the Lord Bishop & Council understanding   very well, that the laws of England gave free toleration   to all religions under the British flag sent word   to the petitioners that if they [loved] the worth of souls   at least as much as they did the ground where   hares foxes & hounds run they would not loose   as many of their flock. I continued to preach and   baptize daily. On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder   Thomas Kington. He was the superintendant of both   preachers & members of the United Brethren, the first   thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire I had baptized   forty five preachers, & 160 members of the United Brethren  which put into my hands one Chapel & 45 homes   licensed according to law to preach in, this opened a   wide field for labor, this enabled me to bring into   the Church through the blessings of God over eighteen hundred   souls during eight month labor including all of the   600 united Brethren exept one persons it also included 
 some two hundred preachers of the various denominations   This field of labor embraced Herefordshire   Glostershire & Worstershire and formed these Conferences   Garway ^Garway^, Gadfield Elm & Frooms Hill, I was visited   by president ^young^ & Dr Richards, Brother Benbow furnished    us with £300, to print the first Book of Mormon   that we published in England and on the 20 day of May   1840 B Young, W Woodruff & W Richards held a council   on the top of Malv Malvern Hill, and there decided  that president Young go dirct ^direct^ to Manchester & publish   3000 copies of the Hymn Book, & 3000 copies   of the Book of Mormon this being the first of the   publishing of these Books in England. The power of God   rested upon us upon this Mission, the sick were   healed, Devils were cast out, the lame was made   to walk one notible case I will mention Mary  Pitt who died in Nauvoo sister to Wm Pitt who   died in Salt Lake City she had not walked upon   her feet for eleven years we carr[i]ed her unto   the water where I baptized her. On the evening of   the 18 May 1840 at Br Kingtons house in Ledbury 
 Dymock Elders B. Young, W Richards & W Woodruff   laid hands upon her head & confirmed her, Br  Young being mouth and rebuked her lameness  & commanded her to rise & walk in the Name of   the Lord and she was made whole and never   used a staff or cruch to the day of her death   she walked through the town of Dymock next   day which created a stir among the people   but the wicked did not feel to give God the   glory. The whole History of this Herefordshire Mission   shows us the importance of carefully ^listening^ listeninig to   the still small voice of the spirit of God, to listen   ^to^ the revelations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord had a   people there prepared for the Gospel, they were praying   for light & truth, the Lord sent me to them   I declared the Gospel of Life and Salvation unto   them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it   and many of them have been gathered to Zion in these  Mountains and many of them have been called to   officiate in the Bishoppric Bishopricks 
 and done much good in Zion, but for   all these things we should ever acknowledge  the Hand of God therein and give him the   honor praise & glory forever & ever Amen

The landlord wanted a little fun, so he   said he would keep me if I would preach.   He wanted to see if I could preach.    I must confess that by this time I be-  came a little mischievous, and pleaded  with him not to set me preaching.    The more I plead to be excused, the   more determined Mr. Jackson was that I   should preach. He took my valise, and   the landlady got me a good supper.    I sat down in a large hall to eat sup-  per. Before I got through, the room   began to be filled by some of the rich   and fashionable of Memphis, dressed in   their broadcloth and silk, while my   appearance was such as you can imagine,   after traveling through the mud as I had   been.    When I had finished eating, the table   was carried out of the room over the   heads of the people. I was placed in the   corner of the room, with a stand having   a Bible, hymn book and candle on it,   hemmed in by a dozen men, with the  landlord in the centre.    There were present some five hundred   persons who had come together, not to   hear a gospel sermon, but to have some   fun.    I read a hymn, and asked them to   sing. Not a soul would sing a word.    I told them I had not the gift of sing-  ing; but with the help of the Lord, I   would both pray and preach. I knelt   down to pray, and the men around me   dropped on their knees. I prayed to   the Lord to give me His Spirit and to   show me the hearts of the people. I   promised the Lord in my prayer I would   deliver to that congregation whatever   He would give to me. I arose and spoke   one hour and a half and it was one of   the best sermons of my life.    The lives of the congregation were   open to the vision of my mind, and I   told them of their wicked deeds and the   reward they would obtain. The men   who surrounded me dropped their heads.   Three minutes after I closed I was the   only person in the room.    Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room   adjoining a large one in which were   assembled many of the men whom I had    [Column 2]  been preaching to. I could hear their   conversation.    One man said he would like to know   how that Mormon boy knew of their   past lives.    In a little while they got to disputing   about some doctrinal point. One sug-  gested calling me to decide the point.   The landlord said, "no; we have had   enough for once.''    In the morning, I had a good break-  fast. The landlord said if I came that   way again to stop at his house, and stay   as long as I might choose.    After leaving Memphis, I traveled   through the country to Benton County,   and preached on the way as I had oppor-  tunity.    I stopped one night with a Squire   Hardman, an Episcopalian.    Most of the night was spent by the   family in music and dancing.    In the morning, at the breakfast table,   Mr. Hardman asked me if we believed   in music and dancing.    I told him we did not really consider   them essential to salvation.    He said he did, and therefore should   not join our Church.    On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the   happy privilege of meeting Elder War-  ren Parrish at the house of Brother Frys.   He had been preaching in that part of   Tennessee, in company with David W.   Patten, and had baptized a number and   organized several small branches.    Brother Patten had returned home,   and Brother Parrish was laboring alone.   I joined him in the ministry, and we   labored together three months and nine-  teen days, when he was called to Kirt-  land.    During the time we were together we   traveled through several counties in Ten-  nessee for the distance of seven hundred   and sixty miles, and preached the gospel   daily, as we had opportunity. We bap-  tized some twenty persons.    By the counsel of the Prophet Joseph   Smith and Oliver Cowdery, Elder Parrish   ordained me an Elder, and left me to   take charge of the branches that had   been raised up in that neighborhood.    As soon as I was left alone I extended   my circuit and labors. For a season I   had large congregations; many seemed   to believe and I baptized a number.    On the 15th of August I had an ap- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  pointment at the house of Brother Tay-  lor, the step-father of Abraham O.   Smoot.    I had to cross Bloody River, which I   had to swim in, in consequence of heavy   rains. While crossing, my horse became   entangled in a tree-top, and almost   drowned; but I succeeded in getting   him loose.    We swam to the shore separately. He   reached the shore first, and waited till I   came out. I got into the saddle, and   went on my way in good spirits, and had   a good meeting.    On the 20th of October I baptized   three Campbellites, one of whom was a   deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr.   Greenwood's, who was eighty years old,   and had been a soldier under General   Washington. His wife, who was ninety-  three years old, I found quite smart, and   busy carding wool. I preached at their   house and baptized both of them.    On the following day I preached at the   house of Benjamin L. Clapp, and bap-  tized seven Campbellites and one Bap-  tist.    On the 16th of November, I preached   at Brother Camp's, and baptized three.   On the day following, it being Sunday,   I preached again at Brother Clapp's, and   baptized five. At the close of the meet-  ing I mounted my horse to ride to   Clark's River, in company with Seth   Utley, four other brethren and two sis-  ters. The distance was twenty miles.    We came to a stream, which was so   swollen by rains, that we could not cross   without swimming our horses. To swim   would not be safe for the females, so we   went up the stream to find a ford. In   the attempt we were overtaken by a se-  vere storm of wind and rain, and lost   our way in the darkness, and wandered   through creeks and mud. But the Lord   does not forsake his Saints in any of   their troubles. While we were in the   woods suffering under the blast of the   storm, groping like the blind for the   wall, a bright light suddenly shone   around us, and revealed to us our dan-  gerous situation on the edge of a gulf.   The light continued with us until we   found the road; we then went on our   way rejoicing, though the darkness re-  turned and the rain continued.    We reached Brother Henry Thomas'   in safety about nine o'clock at night,    [Column 2]  having been five hours in the storm and   forded streams many times. None of us   felt to complain, but were thankful to   God for His preserving care.    On the following day I preached in   Damon Creek, and organized a branch   called the Damon Creek Branch, and   ordained Daniel Thomas a teacher.    On the 19th of December I again   preached at the house of Brother Clapp,   and baptized five persons; one was a   Campbellite preacher.    On the following day I preached at   the house of Brother Henry Thomas,   when a mob of about fifty persons ccl-  lected, headed by a Baptist preacher,   who, after asking one question, advised   the mob not to lay hands on any man   on account of his principles. The advice   was good and well taken.    At the close of the meeting I baptized   three persons, one seventy-eight years   old.    This brings the year 1835 to a close—   the first year of my mission—during   which time I had traveled three thousand   two hundred and forty-eight miles, held   one hundred and seventy meetings, bap-  tized forty-three persons—three of whom   were Campbellite preachers—assisted   Elder Parrish to baptize twenty more,   confirmed thirty-five, organized three   branches, ordained two teachers and one   deacon, procured thirty subscribers for   the Messenger and Advocate, one hun-  dred and seventy-three signers to the   petition to the governor of Missouri for   redress of wrongs done the Saints in   Jackson County, had three mobs rise   against me—but was not harmed—wrote   eighteen letters, received ten, and,   finally, closed the labors of the year   1835, by eating johnny-cake, butter and   honey, at brother A. O. Smoot's.    I spent the fore part of January, 1836,   (the weather being very cold) at the   house of A. O. Smoot, in Kentucky,   studying Kirkham's English Grammar.  I continued to travel and preach in Ken-  tucky and Tennessee and baptized all   that would believe my testimony.    On the 26th of February we held a   conference at the house of Brother Lewis   Clapp (father of B. L. Clapp). There   were represented one hundred and three   members in that mission. I ordained   A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyston   elders, and Daniel Thomas and Benja- 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  min L. Clapp priests. I also ordained   one teacher and two deacons.    After conference I took Brothers   Smoot and Clapp with me to preach.   The former traveled with me constantly   till the 21st of April, when we had the  privilege of meeting with Elder David   W. Patten, who had come direct from   Kirtland, and who had been ordained   one of the Twelve Apostles.    It was a happy meeting. He gave us   an account of the endowments at Kirt-  land, the glorious blessings received, the   ministration of angels, the organization   of the Twelve Apostles and Seventies,   and informed me that I was appointed   a member of the second quorum of   Seventies. All of this was glorious news   to me, and caused my heart to rejoice.    On the 27th of May we were joined   by Elder Warren Parrish, direct from   Kirtland. We had a happy time to-  gether.    On the 28th, we held a conference at   Brother Seth Utley's, where were repre-  sented all the branches of the Church in   the South.    I was ordained on the 31st of May a   member of the second quorum of Seven-  ties under the hands of David W. Patten   and Warren Parrish.    At the close of the conference we   separated for a short time. Elders Pat-  ten and Parrish labored in Tennessee,   Brother Smoot and myself in Kentucky.   On the 9th of June we all met at Damon   Creek Branch, where Brother Patten   baptized two. One was Father Henry   Thomas, who had been a revolutionary  soldier under General Washington. and   father of Daniel and Henry Thomas.    A warrant was issued, on the oath of   a priest, against D. W. Patten, W. Par-  rish and myself. We were accused in   the warrant of the great "crime" of   testifying that Christ would come in this   generation, and that we promised the   Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized.   Brothers Patten and Parrish were taken   on the 19th of June. I, being in another   county, escaped being arrested. The   brethren were put under two thousand   dollars bonds to appear at court. Albert   Petty and Seth Utley were their bonds-  men.    They were tried on the 22nd of June.   They pleaded their own cause. Although   men came forward and testified they did    [Column 2]  receive the Holy Ghost after they were   baptized, the brethren were condemned;   but were finally released by paying the   expenses of the mob court.    There was one peculiar circumstance   connected with this trial by a mob court,   which was armed to the teeth. When   the trial was through with, the people   were not willing to permit more than one   to speak. Warren Parrish had said but   few words, and they were not willing   to let David Patten speak. But he,   feeling the injustice of the court, and   being filled with the power of God,   arose to his feet and delivered a speech   of about twenty minutes, holding them   spell-bound while he told them of their   wickedness and the abominations that   they were guilty of, also of the curse of   God that awaited them, if they did not   repent, for taking up two harmless, in-  offensive men for preaching the gospel of   Christ.    When he had got through his speech   the judge said, "You must be armed   with secret weapons, or you would not   talk in this fearless manner to an armed   court."    Brother Patten replied; "I have   weapons that you know not of, and they   are given me of God, for He gives me   all the power I have."    The judge seemed willing to get rid of   them almost upon any terms, and offered   to dismiss them if their friends would   pay the costs, which the brethren pres-  ent freely offered to do.    When the two were released, they   mounted their horses and rode a mile to   Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had   left, the court became ashamed that they   had been let go so easily and the whole   mob mounted their horses to follow them  to Utley's.    One of the Saints, seeing the state of   affairs, went on before the mob to notify   the brethren, so that they had time to   ride into the woods near by.    They traveled along about three miles   to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to   bed. The night was dark, and they fell   asleep.    But Brother Patten was warned in a   dream to get up and flee, as the mob   would soon be there. They both arose,   saddled their animals, and rode into the   adjoining county.    The house they had just left was soon 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  surrounded by the mob, but the brethren   had escaped through the mercy of God.    I was invited to hold a meeting at a   Baptist meeting house on the 27th of   June. On my arrival I met a large con-  gregation; but, on commencing meeting,   Parson Browning ordered the meeting to   be closed. I told the people I had come   ten miles to preach the gospel to them,   and was willing to stand in a cart, on a   pile of wood, on a fence, or any other   place they would appoint, to have that   privilege.    One man said he owned the fence and   land in front of the meeting house, and   we might use both, for he did not be-  lieve Mormonism would hurt either.    So the congregation crossed the road,   took down the fence and made seats of   it, and I preached to them one hour and   a half. At the close Mr. Randolph   Alexander bore testimony to the truth of   what had been said. He invited me   home with him, bought a Book of Mor-  mon, and was baptized, and I organized  a branch in that place.    On the 18th of July, Brother A. O.   Smoot and I arrived at a ferry on the   Tennessee River, and, as the ferryman   was not at home, the woman kindly gave   us permission to use the ferryboat. We   led our horses on board, and took the   oars to cross the river. Brother Smoot   had never used an oar, and I had not for   some years, so we made awkward work   of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let   another fall overboard, which left us only   one broken oar to get to shore with.   We narrowly escaped running into a   steamboat. We struck shore half a mile   below the landing place, tied up the   boat, jumped on the bank with our   horses, and went on our way with blis-  tered hands, thankful to get off so well.    On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O.  Smoot and I preached at Mr. David   Crider's, Weakly County, Tennessee.   After the meeting Mr. Crider was bap-  tized. A mob gathered and threatened   us, and poisoned our horses so that the   one I rode, belonging to Samuel West,   died a few days after. This horse had   carried me thousands of miles while   preaching the gospel.    I continued to travel with Brothers   Smoot, Patten and Parrish in Tennessee   and Kentucky, and we baptized all who   would receive our testimony.    [Column 2]  On the 2nd day of September we held   a general conference at the Damon   Creek Branch. Elder Thomas B. Marsh,   President of the Twelve Apostles, pre-  sided. All the branches in Tennessee   and Kentucky were represented.    Brothers Randolph Alexander, Benja-  min L. Clapp and Johnson F. Lane were   ordained elders and Lindsay Bradey was   ordained to the lesser priesthood.    I assisted President Marsh to obtain .  fifteen hundred dollars from the Southern   brethren, to enter land in Missouri for   the Church. The brethren made me a   present of fifty dollars, which I sent by   President Marsh to enter forty acres of   land for me. Elder Smoot and I were   released from the Southern mission with   permission to go to Kirtland.    Having returned from my Southern   mission in the autumn of 1836, in com-  pany with Elders A. O. Smoot and Jesse   Turpin, I spent the following winter in   Kirtland. During this time I received   my endowments and attended the school   of Professsor Haws, who taught Greek,   Latin and English grammar. I confined   my studies mostly to Latin and English   grammar.    This winter and the following spring,   in some respects, may be regarded as   one of the most interesting periods of   the history of the Church, when we con-  sider the endowments and teachings   given in the temple, and the great apos-  tasy which followed.    I was married to Miss Phoebe Whit-  more Carter, on the 13th of April, 1837,   and received my patriarchal blessing   under the hands of Father Joseph Smith,   the Patriarch, two days later.    I felt impressed by the Spirit of God   to take a mission to the Fox Islands, sit-  uated east of the Maine shore, a country   I knew nothing about. I made my feel-  ings known to the Apostles, and they   advised me to go.    Feeling that it was my duty to go upon   this mission, I did not tarry at home one   year after having married a wife, as the   law of Moses would have allowed. On   the contrary, I started just one month   and one day after that important event,   leaving my wife with Sister Hale, with   whom she expected to stay for a season.    I left Kirtland in good spirits, in com-  pany with Elder Jonathan H. Hale, and   walked twelve miles to Fairport, where 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  we were joined by Elder Milton Holmes.   There we went aboard the steamer San-  dusky, and made our way to Buffalo, and   proceeded thence to Syracuse, by way of   the Erie Canal. We then walked to   Richland, Oswego County, New York,   where I met my two brothers, whom I   had not seen for several years.    After spending one night there, we   continued our journey to Sackett's Har-  bor, and crossed Lake Ontario on the   steamer Oneida, to Kingston, Upper   Canada, and from there also by steamer   along the canal to Jones' Falls, whence   we walked to a place called Bastard,   Leeds County.    Here we found a branch of the Church,   presided over by John E. Page and   James Blakesly. We accompanied them   to their place of meeting, and attended   a conference with them, at which three   hundred members of the Church were   represented.    Thirty-two persons presented them-  selves for ordination, whom I was re-  quested to ordain, in company with   Elder William Draper. We ordained   seven elders, nine priests, eleven teachers   and five deacons.    We spoke to the people several times   during this conference, and at its close   we were called upon to administer to a   woman who was possessed of the devil.   At times she was dumb, and greatly   afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in   her. She believed in Jesus and in us as   His servants, and wished us to adminis-  ter to her. Four of us laid our hands   upon her head and commanded the   devil, in the name of Jesus Christ, to   depart out of her. It was immediately   done, and the woman arose with great   joy, and gave thanks and praise unto   God; for, according to her faith, she   was made whole from that hour.    A child, also, that was sick, was   healed by the laying on of hands, ac-  cording to the word of God.    We walked thirty miles to visit another   branch of the Saints at Leeds, where   we met with John Gordon and John   Snider. Here we held a meeting and   bore our testimony to the people.    A Sister Carns here came to us and   requested to have the ordinance for the   healing of the sick performed for two of   her children who were afflicted. One   was a suckling child, which was lying at    [Column 2]  the point of death. I took it in my   arms and presented it before the elders,   who laid their hands upon it, and it was   made whole immediately, and I handed   it back to the mother entirely healed.    We afterwards laid hands upon the   other, when it was also healed. It was   done by the power of God, in the name   of Jesus Christ, and the parents praised   God for His goodness.    After leaving the Saints in this place,   we returned to Kingston, and crossed   Lake Ontario in company with Isaac   Russel, John Goodson and John Snider.    Brother Russell seemed to be con-  stantly troubled with evil spirits, which   followed him when he subsequently went   on a mission to England, where Apostles   Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball,   when administering to him, had a severe   contest with them, as Brother Kimball   has related in his history.    Brothers Russell, Goodson and Snider   continued with us to Schenectady, where   they left us to proceed to New York, to   join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go   upon their mission to England.    After leaving these brethren we traveled   by rail to Albany, and walked from there   to Canaan, Connecticut, where we found   a branch of the Church, including Jesse   and Julian Moses and Francis K. Bene-  dict.    We held a two-days' meeting with the   Saints in Canaan, and I ordained Julian   Moses and Francis K. Benedict elders.    After holding several meetings in the   town of Colebrook, and visiting my   half sister, Eunice Woodruff, who taught   school there, I proceeded to Avon, the   place of my birth. There I visited   many of my former neighbors and rela-  tives, and the grave of my mother, Beulah   Woodruff, who died June 11th, 1808,   when twenty-six years of age. The fol-  lowing verse was upon her tombstone:    A pleasing form, a generous heart,   A good companion, just without art;   Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend,   Beloved through life, lamented in the end.    At the close of the day I walked six   miles to Farmington, where my father,   Aphek Woodruff, was living, and I had   the happy privilege of once more meet-  ing with him and my step-mother, whom   I had not seen for seven years. They   greeted me with great kindness, and it   was a happy meeting. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  After visiting with my father a day or   two, I returned to Avon, where most of   my relatives lived, and held meetings   with them, and on the 12th of June,   1837, I baptized my uncle, Ozem Wood-  ruff, his wife Hannah, and his son John,   and we rejoiced together, for this was in   fulfillment of a dream I had in 1818,   when I was eleven years of age.    On the 15th of July I had an appoint-  ment to preach at the house of my uncle,   Adna Hart. While there I had the   happy privilege of meeting with my wife,  Phoebe W. Woodruff, who had come   from Kirtland to meet me and accom-  pany me to her father's home in Scar-  boro, Maine.    Those who had assembled to hear me   preach were relatives, neighbors and for-  mer friends. After meeting, we returned   to Farmington to my father's home,   where I spent the night with my father,   step-mother, sister and wife. Elder Hale   was also with us.    On the 19th of July, Elder Hale left   us to go to his friends in New Rowley,   Massachusetts, and on the same evening   ing house in the town of Farmington.   I had a large congregation of citizens,   with whom I had been acquainted from   my youth. My parents, wife and sister   attended the meeting. The congrega-  tion seemed satisfied with the doctrines   I taught, and they requested me to hold   another meeting; but I felt anxious to   continue my journey, and on the 20th of   July I parted from my father, step-  mother and sister, and took stage for   Hartford with my wife.    On my arrival at Hartford, not having   money to pay the fare of both of us, I   paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Massa-  chusetts, where there was a branch of   the Church, presided over by Brother   Nathaniel Holmes, father of Jonathan   and Milton Holmes, and I journeyed on   foot.    The first day I walked fifty-two miles,   the second day forty-eight, and the third   day thirty-six miles, and arrived at Row-  ley at two o'clock, making one hundred   and thirty-six miles in a little over two   and a half days.    I spent eight days at New Rowley,   holding meetings and visiting the Saints,   including the Holmes family, and left   there on the 1st of August.    [Column 2]  On the 8th of August, in company   with my wife and Elder Hale, I visited   my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his   family in Scarboro, Maine, it being the   first time I had ever seen any of her   relatives. We were very kindly received.   My wife had been absent from her   father's home about one year.    I spent eight days with Father Carter   and household, and one day I went out   to sea with Fabian and Ezra Carter, my   brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with   hooks. We caught two hundred and   fifty cod, haddock and hake, and we saw   four whales, two at a time, it being the   first time in my life I had ever seen the   kind of a fish which is said to have   swallowed Jonah.    On the 18th of August, 1837, 1 parted   with my wife and her father's household,   leaving her with them, and, in company   with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the   mission that I had in view when I left   Kirtland.    We walked ten miles to Portland, and   took passage on the steamboat Bangor,   which carried us to Owl's Head, where   we went on board of a sloop which   landed us on North Fox Island at 2   o'clock, A.M., on the 20th.    The town of Vinal Haven includes   both North and South Fox Islands, in   latitude 44° north, and longitude 69° 10'   west. The population numbered, at the   time of my visit, about 1,800. The in-  habitants were intelligent and indus-  trious, and hospitable to strangers. They   got most of their wealth and living by   fishing. The town fitted out over one   hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides   smaller craft.    North Fox Island is nine miles long   by two miles in width and had a popula-  tion of 800. They had a post office,   one store, a Baptist church and meeting   house, four school houses and a tide   grist mill.    The land was rather poor, yet there   were some good farms. The products   were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and   grass. The principal timber was fir,   spruce, hemlock and birch. Raspberries   and gooseberries grew in great abun-  dance, and some up-land cranberries   were raised. The principal stock of the   island were sheep.    South Fox Island comes as near being   without any definite form as any spot on 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  earth I ever saw. It would be difficult   for any person to describe it. It is about   ten miles in length by five in width, and   is one universal mass of rocks, formed   into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut   up into necks and points to make room   for the coves and harbors that run   through and through the island.    The population was 1,000. The in-  habitants got their living entirely by   fishing. There is no chance for farming   upon the island, and but a few garden   patches, which are cultivated at great   expense. Some few sheep are raised   there.    Many of the inhabitants fish in the   region of Newfoundland, and bring   their fish home and cure them on flakes   and prepare them for the market. They   supply the market with great quantities   of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.    Upon this island there were two stores,  three tide saw mills, six school houses   and a small branch of the Methodist   church, presided over by a priest.    What timber there is upon this island,  such as pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and   birch, and the whortleberries, raspberries  and gooseberries, mostly grow out of   the cracks of the rocks.    Great quantities of fish, and in almost   endless variety, inhabit the coves and   harbors around the islands. The whale,   blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish,   horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, hali-  but, cod, polleck, tom cod, hake, had-  dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife,  herring, pohagen, dolphin, whiting,   frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp,   skid, cusk, blueback, scollop, dogfish,   muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five-fingers,   monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish,   thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eyefish,   cunner, ling, also the eel, lobster, clam,   muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc.,   are found there.    Thus I have given a brief description  of Vinal Haven. It was quite dark   when we landed there, without a farthing  in money. We made our way over the   rocks and through the cedars the best   way we could, until we found a house,   when we rapped at the door. A woman  put her head out of the window and asked   who was there and what was wanted.    I told her we were two strangers, and   wanted a bed to lie down upon until   morning.    [Column 2]  She let us in and gave us a bed, and   we slept until quite late, it being Sunday   morning. When we came out and took   breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked   her what she charged for our entertain-  ment, and she replied that we were wel-  come.    I then asked her if there was any   religion or minister or church on the   island.    She informed me there was a Baptist   minister, by the name of Newton, who   had a congregation and meeting house   about five miles from there.    We thanked her for her kindness,   walked to the meeting house and stepped   inside the doorway. We stood there   until a deacon came to the door, when I   asked him to go and tell the minister in   the pulpit that there were two servants   of God at the door, who had a message  to deliver to that people and wished the   privilege of delivering it.    He sent for us to come to the pulpit,   so we walked through the congregation   with our valises under our arms, and   took a seat by the side of the minister,   who was about to speak as we came to   the door.    He arose and delivered his discourse   to the people, occupying about half an   hour. When he closed he asked me   what was my wish.    1 told him we wished to speak to the   people at any hour that would suit his   or their convenience; so he gave notice   that there were two strangers present  who would speak to the people at five  o'clock that evening.    We were quite a source of wonder-  ment to the people, as they had no idea   who we were.    Mr. Newton asked us home to tea   with him, and we gladly accepted the   invitation. When we arrived at his   house I opened my valise and took out   the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc-  trine and Covenants, laid them upon   the table, and took my seat.    Mr. Newton took up the books and   looked at them, but said nothing. I   then asked him if there were any school   houses upon the island. and if so,   whether they were free to preach in.   He answered that there were four, num-  bered respectively from one to four, and   that they were free.    Mr. Newton and family accompanied

[Column 1]  us to the meeting-house, where we met a   large congregation, none of whom knew   who we were, or anything about our   profession, except the minister.    Elder Hale and I went to the stand,   and I arose with peculiar feelings and   addressed the congregation for one hour,   taking for my text ##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians i. 8–9.##    This was the first time that I or any   other elder of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints had (to my   knowledge) attempted to preach the   the fullness of the gospel and the Book  of Mormon to the inhabitants of any   island of the sea.    I had much liberty in speaking, and   informed the people that the Lord had   raised up a prophet and organized His   Church as in the days of Christ and the   ancient apostles, with prophets, apostles,   and the gifts as anciently, and that He   had brought forth the Book of Mormon.    At the close of my remarks Elder Hale   bore testimony.    I gave liberty for any one to speak   that might wish to. As no one re-  sponded, I announced that we would   hold meetings the next four evenings at   the school-houses, beginning at No. I.    During the first thirteen days of our   sojourn upon the island we preached   seventeen discourses, being invited by   the people to tarry with them. I left a   copy of the Doctrine and Covenants   with Mr. Newton for his perusal.    He read it, and the Spirit of God   bore testimony to him of its truth. He   pondered over it for days, and he walked   his room until midnight trying to decide   whether to receive or reject it. He and   his family attended about a dozen of my   first meetings, and then he made up his   mind, contrary to the dictation of the   Spirit ol God to him, to reject the testi-  mony and come out against me. How-  ever, we commenced baptizing his flock.    The first two we baptized were a sea   captain, by the name of Justin Eames,   and his wife. Brother Jonathan H.   Hale went down into the sea and bap-  tized them on the 3rd of September, and   these were the first baptisms performed   by proper authority upon any of the   islands of the sea (to my knowledge) in   this dispensation.    Before we left Kirtland some of the   leading apostates there had tried to dis-  courage Brother Hale about going on his    [Column 2]  mission, telling him he would never bap-  tize any one, and he had better remain   at home. When Captain Eames offered   himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale   to go and baptize him, and prove those   men false prophets, and he did so.    On the following Sabbath I baptized   his brother, Ebenezer Eames, another   sea captain, and a young lady.    Mr. Newton, the Baptist minister, now   commenced a war against us, and sent to   the South Island for a Mr. Douglas, a   Methodist minister (with whom he had   been at variance for years) to come over   and help him put down "Mormonism."    Mr. Douglas came over, and they got   as many people together as they could   and held a conference. He railed against  Joseph, the prophet, and the Book of   Mormon, and, taking that book in his   hand, with out-stretched arm, declared   that he feared none of the judgments of   God that would come upon him for re-  jecting it as the word of God, (I never   heard what his sentiments upon this sub-  ject were at the end of his term of   fourteen years' imprisonment in the   Thomaston Penitentiary, for an outrage   upon his daughter, the judgment of   which was given upon the testimony of   his wife and daughter.)    I was present and heard Mr. Douglass'   speech upon this occasion, and took   minutes of the same. When he closed I   arose and informed the people that I   would meet with them next Sunday   in the meeting-house, and answer Mr.   Douglass, and wished him, as well as the   people to be present.    I informed the people that Mr. Doug-  lass had made many false statements   against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day   Saints, with whom he had no acquain-  tance, and he had misquoted much Scrip-  ture, all of which I could correct.    We continued to baptize the people on   the North Island until we baptized every   person who owned an interest in the   Baptist meeting-house. I then followed   Mr. Douglass home to the South Island,   and preached the gospel to and baptized   nearly all the members of his church.    The excitement became great on both   islands, and on Sunday, the 17th of   September, I met a large assembly from   both islands, and took the same subject   that Mr. Douglass had dwelt upon in his 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE    [Column 1]  remarks against the Book of Mormon   and our principles.    I spoke two and a half hours, and an-  swered every objection against the Book   of Mormon, Joseph Smith, or our prin-  ciples.    I had good attention and the people   seemed satisfied. At the close of the   meeting Elder Hale administered the   ordinance of baptism.    Mr. Newton, in order to save his   cause, went to the mainland and brought   over several ministers with him and held   a protracted meeting. They hoped by   this to stop the work of God, but all to   no avail, for the whole people would   attend our meeting and receive the word   of God, and we continued to baptize.    We visited the dwellings of most of   inhabitants during our sojourn there.    Upon one occasion, while standing   upon Mr. Carver's farm, on the east end   of the North Island, we counted fifty-  five islands in that region, the majority   of which were not inhabited. We also   saw twenty ships under sail at the same   time.    We had no lack for food while upon   the island, for if we did not wish to   trouble our friends for a dinner, we only   had to borrow a spade or a hoe, and a   kettle and go to the beach and dig a   peck of clams. These, when boiled,   would make a delicious meal, which we   often availed ourselves of.    One day Elder Hale and I ascended   to the top of a high granite rock   on the South Island, for prayer and sup-  plication. We sat down under the shade  of a pine tree which grew out of a fis-  sure in the rock, and Elder Hale read   the ##Jeremiah 16:16|sixteenth chapter## of Jeremiah, where   mention is made of the hunters and   fishers that God would send in the last   days to gather Israel.    Of a truth here we were upon an island   of the sea, standing upon a rock where   we could survey the gallant ships and   also the islands, which were as full of   rocks, ledges, and caves as any part of the   earth. And what had brought us here?   To search out the blood of Ephraim,  the honest and meek of the earth, and   gather them from those islands, rocks,   holes, and caves of the earth unto Zion.    We prayed, and rejoiced together.   The Spirit of God rested upon us; we   spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets    [Column 2]  and apostles in Jerusalem; of Nephi,   Alma, Mormon, and Moroni in America;   Joseph, Hyrum, Oliver, and the apostles   in our own day, and we rejoiced that we   were upon the islands of the sea search-  ing out the blood of Israel.    While being filled with these medita-  tions and the Spirit of God, we fell   upon our knees and gave thanks to the   God of heaven, and felt to pray for  all Israel.    After spending most of the day in   praise and thanksgiving, we descended   to the settlement and held a meeting   with the people.    On the 6th of September we called   upon Captain Benjamin Coombs, and   visited his flakes, where he had one  thousand quintals of codfish drying for   the market. They had mostly been   caught in the region of Newfoundland.   While we were passing Carvey's Wharf   our attention was called to a large school   of mackerel playing by the side of the   wharf. Several men were pitching them   out with hooks. We also flung in a hook   and caught all we wanted, then went on   our way.    We continued to labor, preaching and   baptizing, and organized a branch of   the Church upon each island, and,   finally, on the second of October, we   parted with the Saints on the North   Island to return to Scarboro for a short   time.    We walked from Thomaston to Bath, a   distance of forty-six miles, in one day,   and at the latter place attended a Bap-  tist convention. I also preached there   to a large congregation in the evening,   and the people gave good attention and   wished to learn more about our doc-  trines.    On the following day we walked thirty-  six miles to Portland, and the next day   to Scarboro. Here I again met with my   wife and her father's family.    The time had come for me to give the   parting hand to Brother Jonathan H.   Hale. We had traveled during the sea-  son over two thousand miles together,   with our hearts and spirits well united.    He felt it his duty to return to his   family at Kirtland, but duty called me to   return to my field of labor upon the   islands.    On the 9th of October I accompanied   Brother Hale one mile upon his journey. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  We retired to a grove and knelt down   and prayed together, and had a good   time, and, after commending each other   to God, we parted, he to return to Kirt-  land and I to Fox Islands.    I spent fourteen days visiting the   Saints and friends, and holding meetings   among them, and on the 28th of Octo-  ber I took leave of Father Carter and   and family, and in company with my   wife rode to Portland, and spent the   night with my brother-in-law, Ezra   Carter.    A severe storm arose, so we could not   go to sea until November 1st, when we   took steamer to Owl's Head, carriage to   Thomaston and sloop to Fox Islands.    My second visit to these islands was   made under very different circumstances   to the first. On my first visit I was an   entire stranger to the people, and they   were strangers to the gospel, but upon   my second I met many Saints who had   received the gospel, and who hailed me,   and my companion also, with glad   hearts.    On Sunday, the 5th of November, I   met with a large assembly of Saints and   friends, and again commenced baptizing  such as would receive my testimony.    After visiting the North Island and   holding meetings with the Saints there,  and baptizing two after meeting, I em-  barked on board a sloop, with Captain   Coombs, for another island called the   Isle of Holt. We arrived at noon, and   I preached to the people at night in their   school house, and had an attentive   audience. I spent the night with John   Turner, Esq., who purchased a copy of   the Book of Mormon.    On the following day we returned to   Fox Islands, and as St. Paul once had to   row hard to make the land in a storm,   we had to row hard to make it in a   calm.    After preaching on the North Island   again and baptizing two persons at the   close of the meeting, I returned again to   the mainland in company with Mrs.   Woodruff and others, where I spent fif-  teen days, during which time I visited   among the people, held twelve meetings   and baptized several persons.    On the 13th of December I returned   again to the North Island, where I held   several meetings, and then crossed over   to the South Island.    [Column 2]  On the 20th of December I spent an   hour with Mr. Isaac Crockett in clearing   away large blocks of ice from the water   in a cove, in order to baptize him, which  I did when the tide came in. I also  baptized two more in the same place on   the 26th, and again two others on the  27th.    On the 28th I held a meeting at a   school house, when William Douglass,  the Methodist minister, came and wanted   me to work a miracle, that he might be-  lieve, and otherwise railed against me.    I told him what class of men asked   for signs, and that he was a wicked and   adulterous man, and predicted that the   curse of God would rest upon him, and   that his wickedness would be made mani-  fest in the eyes of the people. (While   visiting these Islands several years after-  wards I learned that the prediction had   really been fulfilled, and that he was   serving out a fourteen years' term of   imprisonment for a beastly crime).    Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thorough-  fare in a boat and walked ten miles, the   length of the island, to meet me, on the   last day of the year. I held a meeting  the same day in the school house, and at   the close of the meeting baptized two   persons in the sea, at full tide, before a  large assembly.    January 1st, 1838, found me standing   upon one of the islands of the sea, a   minister of the gospel of life and salva-  tion unto the people, laboring alone,   though blessed with the society of Mrs.   Woodruff, my companion. I had been   declaring the word of the Lord through   the islands many days, the Spirit of God   was working among the people, preju-  dice was giving way, and the power of   God was manifest by signs following   those who believed.    I spent this New Year's Day visiting   the Saints and their neighbors, and met a   congregation at Captain Charles Brown's,  where I spoke to them for awhile, and at   the close of my remarks led three per-  sons down into the sea and baptized   them. Two of these were sea captains,   namely, Charles Brown, and Jesse   Coombs, and the third was the wife of   Captain Coombs. After confirming them   we spent the evening in preaching, sing-  ing and praying.    I held meetings almost daily with the   Saints up to the 13th, when I crossed to 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  the North Island. Here I found that   the seed I had sown was bringing forth   fruit. Six persons were ready for bap-  tism.    But my mission to these islands was   not an exception to the general rule:   success did not come without many   obstacles presenting themselves. Those   who rejected the word were frequently   inspired by the evil one to make an   attempt at persecution.    Some of those who felt to oppose me   went down to the harbor and got a   swivel and small arms, and planted them   close by the school house, near the sea   shore, and while I was speaking they   commenced firing their cannon and guns.   I continued speaking in great plainness,   but my voice was mingled with the re-  port of musketry.    I told the people my garments were   clear of the blood of the inhabitants of   that island, and asked if any wished to   embrace the gospel. Two persons came   forward and wished to be baptized, and   I baptized them.    On the following day when I went   down to the seaside to baptize a man,   the rabble commenced firing guns again,   as on the previous night. I afterwards   learned that notices were posted up,   warning me to leave the town, but I   thought it was better to obey God than   man, and, therefore, did not go.    The next day I baptized three persons,   and two days subsequently a couple of   others.    I had ample evidence of the fact that   lying spirits had gone out into the world,   for three persons whom I had baptized   had been visited by Mr. Douglass, who   told them that I denied the Bible and   could not be depended upon; and they   yielded to his insinuations until the devil   took possession of them, and they were in   a disaffected condition, and sent for me.    When I met them they were in great   affliction, but when I instructed them in   regard to the principles of the gospel,   and administered to them, they were   delivered from the evil influence and   rejoiced.    On the 15th of February I again   crossed to the North Island, and after   remaining there seven days visiting, we   returned to Camden. Here I met Brother   James Townsend, who had just arrived   from Scarboro.    [Column 2]  I ordained Brother Townsend to the   office of an elder, and we concluded to   take a journey to Bangor, and offer the   gospel to the inhabitants of that city.    We undertook the journey on foot in   the dead of winter, when the snow was   very deep, and the first day broke the   road for seven miles to Scarsmont. The   day following, it being Sunday, we held   two meetings, preached the gospel to the   people, and were kindly entertained.    On the evening of the next day we   wallowed through snowdrifts for a mile,   to meet an appointment to preach in a   schoolhouse, and I got one of my ears   frozen on the way; but notwithstanding   the severity of the weather, we had a   large and attentive audience. We also   spent the next two days with the people   there and held meetings.    On the evening of the 21st of Febru-  ary, as we came out of the school-house,   a light appeared on the northeastern   horizon, and spread to the west, and   soon rolled over our heads. It had the   appearance of fire, blood, and smoke,   and at times resembled contending ar-  mies. The heavens were illuminated for   the space of half an hour. It seemed at   times as though the veil was about to rend   in twain, and the elements were contend-  ing with each other.    We looked upon it as one of the signs   in the heavens predicted by the prophets   of old, as to appear in the last days. We   were wading through deep snowdrifts   most of the time while witnessing this   remarkable scene.    The following day we walked fifteen   miles through deep snow to Belfast, and,   after being refused lodging for the night   by eight families, we were kindly enter-  tained by a Mr. Thomas Teppley.    There was an interesting incident con-  nected with our stay at his house. After   eating our supper, it being late in the   evening. Mr. Teppley placed a stand   before me with a Bible upon it, asking   me to read a chapter and have prayers   with them, he being a religious man.    I opened the Bible mechanically, when   the ##Matthew 25|25th chapter## of Matthew being the   first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I   closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to   his wife and said, "Is not this a strange   thing?" Then he explained to us that   he had just read that chapter and closed   the book when we rapped at the door, 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  and he felt impressed to say, "Walk in,   gentlemen."    There is probably no other chapter in   the whole book that would have the same   influence in causing any one to feed a   person who professed to be a servant of   God and asked for bread.    After becoming acquainted with his   circumstances I thought it providential   that we were led to his house, for al-  though he was a professor of religion and   a Methodist, he was in a state of despair,   believing that he had committed the un-  pardonable sin.    However, I told him what the unpar-  donable sin was, and that he had not   committed it, but that it was a trick of   the devil to make him think so, in order   to torment him. He then acknowledged   that he went down to the wharf a few   evenings before, with the intention of   drowning himself, but when he looked   into the cold, dark water, he desisted   and returned home, and had said nothing   previous to anyone about it.    I taught him the principles of the   gospel, which proved a comfort to him.   We spent the following day in visiting   the people of Belfast, and in the evening   preached in a brick school house, pro-  vided by Mr. Teppley, and many wished   to hear more from us.    We next visited Northport and Frank-  fort, holding meetings at both places,   and on the 1st of March, 1838, we en-  tered Bangor, which at that time had a   population of ten thousand. This was   my birthday, I being thirty-one years of   age.    I visited some of the leading men of   Bangor, and they granted me the use of   the City Hall, where I preached to good   audiences for two successive evenings.   This was the first time a Latter-day   Saint Elder had preached in that town.   Many were anxious to learn more about   our principles, but our visits through all   the towns from Thomaston to Bangor   were necessarily brief, owing to our ap-  pointments upon the Islands. It was   like casting our bread upon the waters   and trusting in God for the result.    On the 5th of March we sailed from   Penobscot for the Isle of Holt, where I   held a meeting on the following evening.    The next day I took passage on the   mail boat for the North Island, where I   again had the privilege of meeting with    [Column 2]  the Saints for prayer and praise before   the Lord.    On my arrival I received a package of   letters from friends abroad. One was   from Kirtland, and gave an account of   the apostasy and tribulations which the   Saints were passing through. Joseph   the Prophet and others, with their fam-  ilies, had gone to Far West, and the   Saints were following him.    Brother Townsend returned home and   I was again left alone in the ministry.    On the afternoon of the 22nd of March,   Brother Sterrett and I, accompanied by   our wives, went several hundred yards   from the shore to a sand-bar (it being   now low tide), to dig clams. The   ground near the shore was much lower   than the bar we were on, and while we   were all busy digging clams and talking   Mormonism, the dashing of the waves   of the incoming tide against the shore   suddenly made us conscious that we had   fifty yards of water between us and the   shore.    The surf waves also added to our diffi-  culty, and as we had no boat, our only   alternattve was to cross our four arms,   thus forming a kind of arm chair for our   wives to sit upon, and carry them in   turn to the shore, wading through two   and a half feet of water.    By the time that we got our wives and   clams safely landed, the truth of the   old saying was firmly impressed upon our   minds, that "Time and tide wait for no   man," not even for a preacher of the   gospel.    On the 28th of March I received a   letter from Zion, requesting me to coun-  sel the Saints I had baptized to sell their   property and gather up to Zion.    About this time the Lord was mani-  festing himself upon the islands in vari-  ous ways, by dreams, visions, healings,   signs and wonders. I will relate one   peculiar circumstance of this kind that   occurred.    Mr. Ebenezer Carver had been inves-  tigating our doctrines for quite a length   of time, and, having a great desire to   know the truth of our religion, he walked   to the sea shore, wishing that he might   have some manifestation in proof of its   truth.    The passage of Scripture came to his   mind that there would be no sign given   "but the sign of the prophet Jonas." 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  While this thought was in his mind a   large fish arose to the top of the water, a   distance from him in the sea, and sud-  denly sank out of sight. He much de-  sired to see it again, and soon it arose   to the top of the water, accompanied by   another fish of about the same size, and   one of them swam on the water in a   straight line towards Mr. Carver as he   stood upon the shore. It came as near   to him the water would permit, and   then stopped and gazed at him with a   penetrating eye, as though it had a mes-  sage for him. It then returned to its   mate in the ocean, and swam out of sight.    Mr. Carver retraced his steps home-  ward, meditating upon the scene and the   wonderful condescension of the Lord.    It is proper to remark that this was at   a season of the year when fish of that   size are never known upon those shores   or seas, and they are never, at any sea-  son, known to come ashore as in the   case mentioned.    Mr. Carver was convinced that it was   intended by the Lord as a sign to him.    Two days after this event I visited Mr.   Carver at his house, and found his wife   confined to her bed with a fever, and   she requested me to administer to her. I   placed my hands upon her head, the   power of God rested upon me, and I   commanded her in the name of Jesus   Christ to arise and walk.    She arose and was healed from that   instant, and she walked down to the sea   and I baptized her in the same place   where the fish visited her husband. I   confirmed her there, and she was filled   with the Holy Ghost, and returned to   her home rejoicing.    I now called the people together and   exhorted them to sell their property and   prepare to accompany me to the land of   Zion. I had labored hard for many days   for the temporal and spiritual welfare of   the inhabitants of those islands, and the   Lord had blessed my labors and given   me many souls as seals of my ministry,   for which I felt to praise Him; and now   I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather   out those who had embraced the gospel,   and lead them to Zion.    The worst difficulty which the Saints   had to contend with in that day was   from false brethren. Warren Parrish,   who had been a prominent elder in the   Church, and had labored with me as a    [Column 2]  missionary, had apostatized and been cut   off from the Church. Learning that I   was building up branches of the Church   upon the island, he and other apostates   conspired to block up my way by writing   lies to the people and stirring up a spirit   of mobocracy upon the islands.    They succeeded in exerting a strong   influence with the wicked, but I knew   they could not hinder the work of God.    On the 6th of April I held a meeting   at Brother Ebenezer Carver's, and,   though the hearts of the wicked were   stirred up in bitterness against me, the   Spirit of God was with me, and at the   close of the meeting I baptized three   persons. One of these was Mrs. Abi-  gail Carver, the mother of Ebenezer   Carver, who was seventy years of age   and in poor health. She had not so   much as visited a neighbor's house for   six years, but upon this occasion she   walked with boldness to the sea shore   and I baptized her, and she returned   rejoicing.    On the 11th of April I had the happy   privilege of again meeting with Elders   Milton Holmes, James Townsend and   Abner Rogers, who had come to the  islands to attend conference with me.    We held our conference on the 13th   of April, on North Fox Island, and had   a representation of the different branches   on the islands. We also preached and   bore our testimony, ordained several and   baptized one person at the close of the   meeting.    On the 17th of April Mrs. Woodruff  left the islands to return to her father's   home in Scarboro, Maine, and a few   days afterwards I called the Saints of the   North Island together and communed   with and instructed them. I also in-  formed them that the Spirit of God bore   record to me that it was our duty to   leave the islands for a season and take a   western mission. They had been faith-  fully warned and the Saints were estab-  lished in the truth, while the wicked   were contending against us, and some   were disposed to take our lives if they   had the power.    On the 28th of April we left the island   in an open sail-boat and made our way   to Owl's Head, and then walked twenty   miles. The following day we walked   forty miles and suffered some with weary   limbs and blistered feet, but we felt that

The next day a   walk of thirty miles brought us to Scar-  boro, where we spent the night at Father  Carter's.    On the 8th of May I parted with Mrs.   Woodruff and Father Carter and family,   and in company with Milton Holmes   walked thirty-three miles towards Ports-  mouth, which city we reached the fol-  lowing day and spent several hours there,   visiting the navy yard. We then walked   to Georgetown, formerly New Rowley,   and spent the night with Father Na-  thaniel Holmes.    On the 11th of May I visited Charles-  ton and Bunker Hill monument, and also  spent several hours in the city of Boston,   which then contained a population of  one hundred thousand. I ascended to   the cupola of the court house, from   which I had a fine view of the city. I   visited several of the Saints in the city,  and walked over the long bridge to   Cambridge and Cambridgeport.    I visited the jail there in order to have  an interview with Brother A. P. Rock-  wood, who had been cast into prison on  the plea of debt, in order to trouble and   distress him, because he was a Mormon.   This was the first time we had ever met.   The jailor permitted me to enter the   room where he was. It was the first time  in my life I had ever entered a prison.   The jailor turned the key upon us and   locked us both in.    I found Brother Rockwood strong in   the faith of the gospel. He had the   Bible, Book of Mormon, Voice of Warn-  ing and Evening and Morning Star as   his companions, which he read daily.    We conversed together for three hours  in this solitary abode. He informed me  of many things which had transpired   while he was confined there as a prisoner.  Among other things, he mentioned that   the jail had taken fire a few days previous   to my visit. He said it looked a little  like a dark hour. The fire was roaring  over his head, while uproar and confu-  sion were upon every hand. Fire engines   were rapidly playing around the build-  ing, with water pouring into every room.  The people were hallooing in the streets.  Prisoners were begging for mercy's sake  to be let out, or they would be consumed  in the fire. One was struggling in the   agonies of death, while others were    [Column 2]  cursing and swearing. Brother Rock-  wood said he felt composed in the midst   of it until the fire was extinguished.    At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked the  prison door to let me out, and I gave  the parting hand to the prisoner of hope.    We had spent a pleasant time together,  and he rejoiced at my visit; and who   would not, to meet with a friend in a  lonely prison? I left him in good spirits,   and wended my way back to Boston.    I spent several days in Boston, hold-  ing meetings with the Saints there, and   then walked to Providence, Rhode   Island, preaching by the way.    I there took steamer and arrived in  New York on the 18th of May, where I   met with Elder Orson Pratt and his   family, and Elijah Fordham and near   one hundred Saints who had been bap-  tized in the city of New York.    I spent three days in New York visit-  ing the Saints and holding meetings.   Several new converts were baptized while  I was there.    Leaving New York, I traveled through   New Jersey, and returned to Farming-  ton, Connecticut, the residence of my  father. I arrived at his house on the  12th of June.    It was with peculiar sensations that I   walked over my native land, where I   spent my youth, and cast my eyes over   the Farmington meadows and the hills  and dales where I had roamed in my  boyhood with my father, step mother,   brothers and half-sister.    On my arrival at my father's home I   had the happy privilege of again taking  my parents and sister by the hand, also  my uncle, Ozem Woodruff, who was   among the number I had baptized the  year before.    After spending an hour in conversa-  tion, we sat down around our father's   table and supped together and were re-  freshed. Then we bowed upon our   knees together in the family circle and  offered up the gratitude of our hearts to  God for preserving our lives and reunit-  ing us.    I spent the next eighteen days in  Farmington and Avon, visiting my   father's household, my uncles, aunts   cousins, neighbors and friends, preach-  ing the gospel of Jesus Christ unto them  and striving to bring them into the  kingdom of God. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  On the 1st of July, 1838, one of the   most interesting events transpired of my  whole life in the ministry.    When Father Joseph Smith gave me   my patriarchal blessing, among the many   wonderful things of my life, he promised   me that I should bring my father's house-  hold into the kingdom of God, and I   felt that if ever I obtained the blessing,  the time had come for me to perform it.    By the help of God, I preached the  gospel faithfully to my father's house-  hold and to all that were with him, as   well as to my other relatives, and I had   appointed a meeting on Sunday, the 1st   of July, at my father's home.    My father was believing my testimony,   as were all in his household, but upon   this occasion the devil was determined  to hinder the fulfillment of the promise  of the patriarch unto me.    It seemed as though Lucifer, the son   of the morning, had gathered together  the hosts of hell and exerted his powers   upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the   whole household, and all were tempted  to reject the work. And it seemed as  though the same power would devour  me. 1 had to take to my bed for an   hour before the time of meeting. I there   prayed unto the Lord with my whole  soul for deliverance, for I knew the  power of the devil was exercised to hin-  der me from accomplishing what God  had promised me.    The Lord heard my prayer and an-  swered my petition, and when the hour  of meeting had come I arose from my   bed, and could sing and shout for joy to   think I had been delivered from the  power of the evil one.    Filled with the power of God, I stood   up in the midst of the congregation and   preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto  the people in great plainness.    At the close of the meeting we assem-  bled on the banks of the Farmington  River, "because there was much water  there," and I led six of my friends into   the river and baptized them for the re-  mission of their sins.    All of my father's household were in-  cluded in this number, according to the  promise of the Patriarch. They were  all relatives except Dwight Webster, who   was a Methodist class-leader and was   boarding with my father's family.    I organized the small number of nine    [Column 2]  persons, eight of whom were my relatives,   into a branch of the Church, and or-  dained Dwight Webster to the office of a   priest and administered the sacrament  unto them.    It was truly a day of joy to my soul.   My father, stepmother, and sister were  among the number baptized. I after-  wards added a number of relatives. I  felt that this day's work alone amply re-  paid me for all my labors in the min-  istry.    Now, as my mission to my native land   was accomplished, which I felt im-  pressed to take while I was upon the  islands, I felt it my duty to return here.    Monday, July 2nd, 1838, was the last   day and night I spent at my father's  home while upon this mission. At the  setting of the sun I took the last walk   with my sister I ever had with her while   in my native State. We walked by the  canal and viewed the river and the   fields, and conversed upon our future  destiny.    After evening prayer with the family,   my father retired to rest, and I spent a   season with my stepmother, who had   reared me from my infancy. In conver-  sation we felt sensibly the weight of the   power of temptation, out of which the   Lord had delivered us.    I also spent a short time with my sis-  ter Eunice, the only sister I was ever   blessed with in my father's family. I   had baptized her into the Church and  Kingdom of God, and we mingled our  sympathies, prayers, and tears together  before the throne of grace.    How truly are the bonds of consan-  guinity and of the blood of Christ united   in binding the hearts of the Saints of  God together, and "how blessings   brighten as they take their flight."    This being the last night I was to   spend beneath my father's roof while   upon this mission, I felt the weight of it,   and my prayer was, "O, Lord, protect  my father's house, and bring him to   Zion!" (which prayer was granted.)    On the morning of July 3rd, I took   leave of my relatives and my native  land, and started on my return to  Maine.    I arrived in Scarboro on the 6th, and   on the 14th my first child—a daughter—  was born at Father Carter's house. We   named her Sarah Emma. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  On the 30th of July, I left my wife   and child at Father Carter's and started  once more to visit Fox Islands.    While holding meeting with the Saints   at North Vinal Haven on the 9th of   August, I received a letter from Thomas   B. Marsh, who was then President of the  Twelve Apostles, informing me that  Joseph Smith, the Prophet, had received  a revelation, naming as persons to be  chosen to fill the places of those who had   fallen: John E. Page, John Taylor, Wil-  ford Woodruff and Willard Richards.    President Marsh added, in his letter,   "Know then, Brother Woodruff, by this,  that you are appointed to fill the place of   one of the Twelve Apostles, and that it   is agreeable to the word of the Lord,   given very lately, that you should come  speedily to Far West, and, on the 26th   of April next, take your leave of the   Saints here and depart for other climes  across the mighty deep."    The substance of this letter had been  revealed to me several weeks before, but  I had not named it to any person.    The time having now come for me to  prepare for leaving the islands, I had a   desire to take with me all the Saints I   could get to go to Zion. There had al-  ready been a line drawn upon the islands  between the Saints and those who had   rejected the gospel, and the enemies  were very bitter against me and the work  of God I had labored to establish. They   threatened my life, but the Saints were   willing to stand by me.    I spent four days with the Saints visit-  ing them, holding meetings and encour-  aging them, while the devil was raging   upon every hand.    I had baptized and organized into the   Church nearly one hundred persons while  upon the islands, and there seemed a   prospect of gathering about half of them   with me, but the devil raged to such an   extent that quite a number were terri-  fied.    The inhabitants of the islands had but  little acquaintance with the management  of horses or wagons; in fact, most of  them knew more about handling a shark  than a horse. However, in company   with Nathanial Thomas, who had sold  his property and had money, I went to  the mainland and purchased ten new   wagons, ten sets of harness and twenty  horses. When I got everything prepared    [Column 2]  for the company to start, I left the affairs   with Brother Thomas, and went on ahead   of the company to Scarboro, to prepare   my own family for the journey.    The outfit which I purchased for the   company cost about two thousand dollars.    Before leaving Brother Thomas, I coun-  selled him in regard to the course to pur-  sue, and charged him not to be later  than the 1st of September in starting  from the mainland.    I arrived at Father Carter's on the 19th   of August, and waited with great anxiety   for the arrival of the company from the  islands, but instead of reaching there by   the 1st of September they did not arrive   till the 3rd of October; and when they   did arrive the wagon covers were all fly-  ing in the breeze. It took a good day's   work to nail down the covers, paint the  wagons and get prepared for the journey.    On the afternoon of the 9th of Octo-  ber, we took leave of Father Carter and  family, and started upon our journey of   two thousand miles at this late season of  the year, taking my wife with a suckling   babe at her breast with me, to lead a   company of fifty-three souls from Maine   to Illinois, and to spend nearly three  months in traveling in wagons, through  rain, mud, snow and frost. It was such  a trial as I never before had attempted   during my experience as a minister of the  gospel.    On our arrival at Georgetown we were   joined by Elder Milton Holmes. We   traveled each day as far as we could go,   and camped wherever night overtook us.    On the 13th of October, while cross-  ing the Green Mountains, I was attacked   with something resembling the cholera.  I was very sick. I stopped at a house  for about two hours, but the Elders ad-  ministered to me, and I revived.    On the 24th I was again taken sick,   and my wife and child were also stricken  down. We also had several others sick   in the company, through the exposure of   the journey.    On the 31st we had our first snow   storm, and the horses dragged our wagons  all day through mud, snow and water.    On the 2nd of November Elder Milton  Holmes left us, and took steamer for  Fairport; and two days afterwards a lit-  tle child of Nathaniel Thomas', about   six years of age, died, and we had to  bury it at Westfield. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  The roads finally became so bad and   the cold so severe that Nathaniel Thomas   and James Townsend concluded to stop  for the winter. We parted with them on   the 21st of November, near New Portage,   Ohio.    On the 23rd of November my wife,   Phoebe, was attacked with a severe head-  ache, which terminated in brain fever.   She grew more and more distressed daily   as we continued our journey. It was a   terrible ordeal for a woman to travel in   a wagon over rough roads, afflicted as  she was. At the same time our child   was also very sick.    The first of December was a trying  day to my soul. My wife continued to  fail, and in the afternoon, about four   o'clock, she appeared to be struck with   death. I stopped my team, and it   seemed as though she would breath her  last lying in the wagon. Two of the   sisters sat beside her, to see if they could  do anything for her in her last moments.    1 stood upon the ground, in deep af-  fliction, and meditated. I cried unto  the Lord, and prayed that she might live  and not be taken from me. I claimed the  promises the Lord had made unto me   through the prophets and patriarchs, and  soon her spirit revived, and I drove a   short distance to a tavern, and got her  into a room and worked over her and her  babe all night, and prayed to the Lord   to preserve her life.    In the morning the circumstances were   such that I was under the necessity of   removing my wife from the inn, as there  was so much noise and confusion at the   place that she could not endure it. I  carried her out to her bed in the wagon  and drove two miles, when I alighted at   a house and carried my wife and her bed   into it, with a determination to tarry  there until she recovered her health or  or passed away. This was on Sunday   morning, December 2nd.    After getting my wife and things into  the house and wood provided to keep up  a fire, I employed my time in taking   care of her. It looked as though she had   but a short time to live.    She called me to her bedside in the  evening and said she felt as though a  few moments more would end her exist-  ence in this life. She manifested great   confidence in the cause she had em-  braced, and exhorted me to have confi-    [Column 2]  dence in God, and to keep his com-  mandments.    To all appearances she was dying. I   laid hands upon her and prayed for her,  and she soon revived and slept some dur-  ing the night.    December 3rd found my wife very low.   I spent the day in taking care of her,   and the following day I returned to   Eaton to get some things for her. She   seemed to be gradually sinking, and in  the evening the spirit apparently left her   body, and she was dead.    The sisters gathered around her body,  weeping, while I stood looking at her in  sorrow. The spirit and power of God   began to rest upon me until, for the first  time during her sickness, faith filled my  soul, although she lay before me as one   dead.    I had some oil that was consecrated  for my anointing while in Kirtland. I   took it and consecrated it again before  the Lord for anointing the sick. I then  bowed down before the Lord and prayed  for the life of my companion, and I   anointed her body with the oil in the  name of the Lord. I laid my hands  upon her, and in the name of Jesus   Christ I rebuked the power of death and  the destroyer, and commanded the same  to depart from her and the spirit of life  to enter her body.    Her spirit returned to her body, and   from that hour she was made whole; and   we all felt to praise the name of God,   and to trust in Him and keep His com-  mandments.    While this operation was going on   with me (as my wife related afterwards)   her spirit left her body, and she saw it   lying upon the bed, and the sisters weep-  ing. She looked at them and at me,   and upon her babe, and, while gazing  upon this scene, two personages came  into the room, carrying a coffin, and told  her they had come for her body. One  of these messengers told her she might  have her choice—she might go to rest in   the spirit world, or, on one condition she   could have the privilege of returning to  her tabernacle and continuing her labors  upon the earth. The condition was, if   she felt that she could stand by her hus-  band, and with him pass through all the   cares, trials, tribulations and afflictions   of life which he would be called upon to  pass through for the gospel's sake unto 
 [Column 1]  the end. When she looked at the situ-  ation of her husband and child she said:   "Yes, I will do it."    At the moment that decision was  made the power of faith rested upon me,   and when I administered unto her, her   spirit entered her tabernacle, and she   saw the messengers carry the coffin out  of the door.    On the morning of the 6th of Decem-  ber, the Spirit said to me, "Arise and   continue thy journey," and through the  mercy of God my wife was enabled to   arise and dress herself, and walked to the  wagon, and we went on our way re-  joicing.    On the night of the 11th I stopped  for the night at an inn, the weather be-  ing very cold. I there learned of the  sudden death of my brother, Asahel H.   Woodruff, a merchant of Terre Haute,  Indiana.    I had anticipated a joyful meeting   with this brother on the following day.   Instead of this, I only had the privilege   of visiting his grave, in company with  my wife, and examining a little into his  business.    I was offered the position of admin-    [Column 2]  istrator of his affairs, but I was leading  a company of Saints to Zion, and could  not stop to attend to his temporal busi-  ness. Strangers settled his affairs and   took possession of his property. His   relatives obtained nothing from his effects   but a few trifling mementos.    I left this place and crossed into  Illinois on the 13th of December, and  arrived at Rochester on the 19th, and,   getting information of the severe perse-  cutions of the Saints in Missouri, and   the unsettled state of the Church at that   time, we concluded to stop at Rochester  and spend the winter.    Thus ended my journey of two months  and sixteen days, leading the Fox Island   Saints to the west, through all the perils  of a journey of nearly two thousand   miles, in the midst of sickness and great  severity of weather.    I took my family in the spring and   removed to Quincy, Illinois, where I   could mingle with my brethren, and I  felt to praise God for His protecting care  over me and my family in all our  afflictions.    TO BE CONTINUED. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  CHAPTER II.    ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP—MY MIS-  SION TO ENGLAND.    Joseph Smith, the Prophet, asked the  Lord what His will was concerning the  Twelve, and the Lord answered in a   revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in which  He says: "Let them take leave of my   Saints in the city Far West, on the 26th  day of April next, on the building spot   of my house, saith the Lord. Let my   servant John Taylor, and also my ser-  vant John E. Page, and also my servant   Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant   Willard Richards, be appointed to fill   the places of those who have fallen, and   be officially notified of their appoint-  ment.'"    It will be observed that this differs  from nearly all other revelations in this   respect: a fixed day and a stated place  were given for the commencement of   the mission. When the revelation was  given, all was peace and quietude in Far  West, Missouri, the city where most of   the Latter day Saints dwelt; but before   the time came for its fulfillment, the  Saints of God had been driven out of   the State of Missouri into the State of  Illinois, under the edict of Governor   Boggs; and the Missourians had sworn  that if all the other revelations of Joseph  Smith were fulfilled, that should not be.   It stated the day and the place where the  Twelve Apostles should take leave of the  Saints, to go on their missions across the   great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-  souri had declared that they would see   that it should not be fulfilled.    It seemed as though the Lord, having  a foreknowledge of what would take   place, had given the revelation in this  manner to see whether the Apostles   would obey it at the risk of their lives.    When the time drew near for the ful-  fillment of this commandment of the   Lord, Brigham Young was the President   of the Twelve Apostles; Thomas B.  Marsh, who was the senior Apostle, had   fallen. Brother Brigham called together  those of the Twelve who were then at   Quincy, Illinois, to see what their minds   would be about going to Far West, to  fulfill the revelation. The Prophet Jos-    [Column 2]  eph and his brother Hyrum, Sidney Rig-  don, Lyman Wight and Parley P. Pratt  were in prison in Missouri at the time;   but Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch,  was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others   who were present did not think it wis-  dom for us to attempt the journey, as   our lives would be in great jeopardy.   They thought the Lord would take the  will for the deed. But when President   Young asked the Twelve what our feel-  ings were upon the subject, we all of us,   as the voice of one man, said the Lord   God had spoken, and it was for us to   obey. It was the Lord's business to take  care of His servants, and we would ful-  fill the commandment, or die trying.    To fully understand the risk the  Twelve ran in making this journey, my  readers should remember that Lilburn   W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-  souri, had issued a proclamation, in   which all the Latter-day Saints were re-  quired to leave that State or be exter-  minated. Far West had been captured   by the militia, who were really only an  organized mob; the citizens had been  compelled to give up their arms; all the   leading men who could be got hold of  had been taken prisoners; the rest of   the Saints—men, women and children—   had to flee as best they could out of the   State to save their lives, leaving all their   houses, lands and other property which   they could not carry with them to be   taken by the mob. In fact they shot   down the cattle and hogs of the Saints   wherever they could find them, and   robbed them of nearly everything they  could lay their hands upon. Latter-day  Saints were treated with merciless cruelty   and had to endure the most outrageous   abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-  culty that many of them got out of the   State, especially the prominent men; for  there were many men of that State at   that time, who acted as though they   thought it no more harm to shoot a   Mormon than a mad dog. From this   brief explanation you will be able to un-  derstand why some of the brethren   thought we were not required to go back   to Far West to start from there upon our  mission across the ocean to Europe.    Having determined to carry out the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  requirement of the revelation, on the   18th of April, 1839, I took into my   wagon Brigham Young and Orson Pratt:   and Father Cutler took into his wagon   John Taylor and George A. Smith, and  we started for Far West.    On the way we met John E. Page, who   was going with his family to Quincy,  Illinois. His wagon had turned over,   and when we met him he was trying to  gather up a barrel of soft soap with his   hands. We helped him get up his wagon.  He drove down into the valley below,   left his wagon, and accompanied us on   our way.    On the night of the 25th of April,   we arrived at Far West, and spent the   night at the home of Morris Phelps, who  was not there, however, himself; he,  having been taken prisoner by the mob,   was still in prison.    On the morning of the 26th of April,  1839, notwithstanding the threats of our   enemies that the revelation which was to  be fulfilled this day should not be, and   notwithstanding that ten thousand of the  Saints had been driven out of the State   by the edict of the governor, and though   the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hy-  rum Smith, with other leading men were   in the hands of our enemies, in chains  and in prison, we moved on to the tem-  ple grounds in the city of Far West, and   held a council, and fulfilled the revela-  tion and commandment given unto us,   and we performed many other things at   this council.    We excommunicated from the Church   thirty-one persons, who had apostatized  and become its enemies.    The "Mission of the Twelve" was   sung, and we then repaired to the south-  east corner of the temple ground, and,  with the assistance of Elder Alpheus   Cutler, the master workman of the   building committee, laid the southeast  chief corner stone of the temple, accord-  ing to revelation.    There were present of the Twelve   Apostles: Brigham Young, Heber C.   Kimball, Orson Pratt, John E. Page,   and John Taylor, who proceeded to  ordain Wilford Woodruff and George  A. Smith to the Apostleship.    The Twelve then took their leave of,   and gave the parting hand to the follow-  ing Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.  Butler, Elias Smith, Norman Shearer,    [Column 2]  William Burton, Stepen Markham, Shad-  rach Roundy, William O. Clark, John   W. Clark, Hezekiah Peck, Darwin   Chase, Richard Howard, Mary Ann   Peck, Artimesia Granger, Martha Peck,   Sarah Granger, Theodore Turley, Hi-  ram Clark, and Daniel Shearer.    Bidding good-by to the small remnant   of the Saints who remained on the temple  ground to see us fulfill the revelation and   commandments of God, we turned our  backs on Far West and Missouri, and  returned to Illinois. We had accom-  plished the mission without a dog moving  his tongue at us, or any man saying,  "Why do you do so?"    We crossed the Mississippi river on the  steam ferry, entered Quincy on the 2nd   of May, and all had the joy of reaching   our families once more in peace and  safety.    There was an incident connected with  our journey that is worthy of record.    While we were on our way to fulfill   the revelation, Joseph, the Prophet, and  his companions in chains had been liber-  ated, through the blessings of God, from  their enemies and prison, and they passed  us. We were not far distant from each   other, but neither party knew it. They   were making their way to their families  in Illinois, while we were traveling to   Far West into the midst of our enemies.  So they came home to their families and   friends before our return.    May the 3rd was a very interesting day   to me, as well as to others. In company  with five others of the quorum of the   Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to  Mr. Cleveland's, to visit Brother Joseph   Smith and his family.    Once more I had the happy privilege   of taking Brother Joseph by the hand.   Two years had rolled away since I had   seen his face. He greeted us with great   joy, as did Hyrum Smith and Lyman   Wight, all of whom had escaped from  their imprisonment together. They had   been confined in prison six months, and   had been under sentence of death three   times; yet their lives were in the hands   of God, and He had delivered them,  and they were now mingling with their  wives, children and friends, and out of  the reach of the mob. Joseph was   frank, open and familiar as usual, and   our rejoicing was great.    No man can understand the joyful sen- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  sations created by such a meeting, ex-  cept those who have been in tribulation   for the gospel's sake.    After spending the day together, we  returned to our families at night.    On the day following, May 4th, we  met in conference at Quincy, the Prophet  Joseph presiding, which caused great joy  and rejoicing to all the Saints.    On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smith  addressed the assembly, followed by  Sidney Rigdon and the Twelve Apostles.  The Spirit of the Lord was poured out  upon us, and we had a glorious day.    On May 6th, I met with the Seventies,  and we ordained sixty men into the   quorums of elders and seventies. Brother   Joseph met with the Twelve, bishops and  elders, at Bishop Partridge's house; and  there were a number with us who were   wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them   was Isaac Laney, who had been in com-  pany with about twenty others, at the  mill, when a large armed mob fired   among them with rifles and other   weapons, and shot down seventeen of the   brethren, and wounded more. Brother   Laney fled from the scene, but they  poured a shower of lead after him, which  pierced his body through and through.   He showed me eleven bullet holes in his  body. There were twenty-seven in his  shirt, seven in his pantaloons, and his  coat was literally cut to pieces. One  ball entered one arm-pit and came out  at the other.    Another entered his back and came   out at the breast. A ball passed through  each hip, each leg and each arm. All   these shots were received while he was   running for life, and, strange as it may   appear, though he had also one of his  ribs broken, he was able to outrun his  enemies, and his life was saved. We   can only acknowledge this deliverance   to be by the power and mercy of God.    President Joseph Young was also  among the number. He also fled, and  although the balls flew around him like  hail, he was not wounded. How myste-  rious are the ways of the Lord!    Before starting on our missions to  England, we were under the necessity  of settling our families. A place called  Commerce, afterwards named Nauvoo,   was selected as the place at which our  people should settle.    I left Quincy, in company with    [Column 2]  Brother Brigham Young and our families  on the 15th of May, and arrived in   Commerce on the 18th. After an inter-  view with Joseph we crossed the river at   Montrose, Iowa. President Brigham   Young and myself, with our families,   occupied one room about fourteen feet   square. Finally Brother Young obtained  another room and moved into it by him-  self. Then Brother Orson Pratt and   family moved into the same room with   myself and family.    While I was living in this cabin in the  old barracks, we experienced a day of   God's power with the Prophet Joseph.  It was a very sickly time and Joseph had  given up his home in Commerce to the  sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-  yard and was living in that himself.   The large number of Saints who had  been driven out of Missori, were flock-  ing into Commerce; but had no homes   to go into, and were living in wagons,  in tents, and on the ground. Many,   therefore, were sick through the ex-  posure they were subjected to. Bro-  ther Joseph had waited on the sick,  until he was worn out and nearly sick  himself.    On the morning of the 22nd of July,  1839, he arose reflecting upon the sit-  uation of the Saints of God in their  persecutions and afflictions, and he   called upon the Lord in prayer, and the  power of God rested upon him mightily,  and as Jesus healed all the sick around  Him in His day, so Joseph, the Prophet  of God, healed all around on this occa-  sion. He healed all in his house and  door-yard, then, in company with Sidney  Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he   went through among the sick lying on  the bank of the river, and he com-  manded them in a loud voice, in the  name of Jesus Christ, to come up and   be made whole, and they were all healed.  When he healed all that were sick on   the east side of the river, they crossed  the Mississippi river in a ferry-boat to  the west side, to Montrose, where we   were. The first house they went into   was President Brigham Young's. He  was sick on his bed at the time. The  Prophet went into his house and healed  him, and they all came out together.  As they were passing by my door, Brother  Joseph said: "Brother Woodruff, fol-  low me." These were the only words 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  spoken by any of the company from the   time they left Brother Brigham's house  till we crossed the public square, and   entered Brother Fordham's house. Bro-  ther Fordham had been dying for an  hour, and we expected each minute  would be his last.    I felt the power of God that was  overwhelming His Prophet.    When we entered the house, Brother   Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,  and took him by the right hand; in his  left hand he held his hat.    He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes  were glazed, and that he was speechless   and unconscious.    After taking hold of his hand, he   looked down into the dying man's face  and said: "Brother Fordham do you  not know me?" At first he made no   reply; but we could all see the effect of   the spirit of God resting upon him.    He again said: "Elijah, do you not  know me?"    With a low whisper, Brother Ford-  ham answered, "Yes!"    The Prophet then said, "Have you   not faith to be healed?"    The answer, which was a little plainer  than before, was: "I am afraid it is too  late. If you had come sooner, I think  it might have been."    He had the appearance of a man wak-  ing from sleep. It was the sleep of   death.    Joseph then said: "Do you believe  that Jesus is the Christ?"    "I do, Brother Joseph," was the re-  ponse.    Then the Prophet of God spoke with  a loud voice, as in the majesty of the   Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, in  the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise  and be made whole!''    The words of the Prophet were not   like the words of man, but like the voice  of God. It seemed to me that the  house shook from its foundation.    Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed   like a man raised from the dead. A   healthy color came to his face, and life   was manifested in every act.    His feet were done up in Indian meal   poultices. He kicked them off his feet,   scattered the contents, and then called   for his clothes and put them on. He  asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and  ate it; then put on his hat and followed    [Column 2]  us into the street, to visit others who  were sick.    The unbeliever may ask: "Was there   not deception in this?"    If there is any deception in the mind   of the unbeliever, there was certainly   none with Elijah Fordham, the dying   man, nor with those who were present  with him, for in a few minutes he would  have been in the spirit world, had he   not been rescued. Through the bless-  ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in   which year he died in Utah, while all   who were with him on that occasion,  with the exception of one, are in the  spirit world.    Among the number were Joseph and   Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A.   Smith, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt.   Wilford Woodruff is the only one living   who was present at that time, and he   will soon mingle with those who have  gone.    As soon as we left Brother Fordham's  house, we went into the house of Joseph  B. Noble, who was very low and danger-  ously sick.    When we entered the house, Brother  Joseph took him by the hand, and com-  manded him, in the name of Jesus  Christ, to arise and be made whole.   He did arise and was immediately  healed.    While this was going on, the wicked  mob in the place, led by one Kilburn,  had become alarmed, and followed us   into Brother Noble's house.    Before they arrived there, Brother   Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-  ham to offer prayer.    While he was praying, the mob en-  tered, with all the evil spirits accom-  panying them.    As soon as they entered, Brother   Fordham, who was praying, fainted and   sank to the floor.    When Joseph saw the mob in the  house, he arose and had the room cleared  of both that class of men and their at-  tendant devils. Then Brother Fordham  immediately revived and finished his   prayer.    This case of Brother Noble's was the  last one of healing upon that day. It   was greatest day for the manifestation of  the power of God through the gift of 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  healing since the organization of the   Church.    When we left Brother Noble, the  Prophet Jeseph went, with those who   accompanied him from the other side to  the banks of the river, to return home.    While waiting for the ferry-boat, a  man of the world, knowing of the mir-  acles which had been performed, came  to him and asked him if he would not   go and heal two twin children of his  about five months old, who were both  lying sick nigh unto death.    They were some two miles from Mon-  trose.    The Prophet said he could not go;  but, after pausing some time, he said   he would send some one to heal them;  and he turned to me and said: "You go   with the man and heal his children."    He took a red silk handkerchief out   of his pocket and gave it to me, and   told me to wipe their faces with the   handkerchief when I administered to   them, and they should be healed. He  also said unto me: "As long as you will  keep that handkerchief, it shall remain  a league between you and me.''    I went with the man, and did as the  Prophet commanded me, and the chil-  dren were healed.    I have possession of the handkerchief   unto this day.    On the first of July, 1839, Joseph  Smith and his counselors, Sydney Rig-  don and Hyrum Smith, crossed the river   to Montrose, to spend the day with the   Twelve, and set them apart and bless   them, before they started upon their  missions. There were twelve of us who   met there, and we all dined in my   house.    After dinner, we assembled at Brother   Brigham Young's house for our meeting.    Brother Hyrum Smith opened by   prayer; after which the Presidency laid  their hands upon our heads and gave  each of us a blessing.    President Rigdon was mouth in bless-  ing me, and also blessed Sisters Young,   Taylor and Woodruff.    The prophet Joseph promised us if we   would be faithful, we should be blessed  upon our mission, have many souls as   seals of our ministry, and return again  in peace and safety to our families and  friends; all of which was fulfilled.    Brother Hyrum advised me to preach    [Column 2]  the first principles of the gospel; he  thought that was about as much as this  generation could endure.    Then Joseph arose and preached some   precious things of the kingdom of God   unto us, in the power of the Holy Ghost;   some of which I here copy from my   journal:    "Ever keep in exercise the principle   of mercy, and be ready to forgive our   brethren on the first intimation of their  repentance and desire for forgiveness;  for our Heavenly Father will be equally  as merciful unto us. We also ought to   be willing to repent of and confess our   sins, and keep nothing back. Let the   Twelve be humble and not be exalted,  and beware of pride and not seek to ex-  cel one another, but act for each other's  good, and honorably make mention of   each other's names in prayer before the   Lord and before your fellow-men. Do   not backbite or devour a brother. The   elders of Israel should seek to learn by  precept and example in this late age of  the world and not be obliged to learn   everything we know by sad experience.   I trust the remainder of the Twelve will  learn wisdom and not follow the example  of those who have fallen. When the   Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus  Christ, stand before the congregations  of the earth, and they preach in the   power and demonstration of the Holy   Ghost, and the people are astonished  and confounded at the doctrine, and say  'That man has preached a powerful ser-  mon,' then let that man or those men  take care that they do not ascribe the   glory unto themselves, but be careful  that they are humble, and ascribe the  glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by   the power of the Holy Priesthood and  the Holy Ghost that they have the power  thus to speak.    "Who art thou, O man, but dust! and   from whom dost thou receive thy power  and blessings, but from God?    "Then let the Twelve Apostles and   Elders of Israel observe this key, and be  wise: Ye are not sent out to be taught,   but to teach.    "Let every man be sober, be vigilant,   and let all his words be seasoned with  grace, and keep in mind it is a day of   warning, and not of many words.    "Act honestly before God and man;   beware of sophistry, such as bowing and

"I wish to say to the Twelve and all   the Saints, to profit by this important  key, that in all your trials, troubles,  temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprison-  ments and deaths, see to it that you do  not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not  betray the revelations of God, whether  in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doc-  trine and Covenants, or any of the   words of God.    "Yea, in all your troubles, see that   you do not this thing, lest innocent   blood be found upon your skirts, and ye   go down to hell.    "We may ever know by this sign that   there is danger of our being led to a fall   and apostasy when we give way to the  devil, so as to neglect the first known   duty; but whatever you do, do not be-  tray your friend."    The foregoing are some of the instruc-  tions given to the Twelve by the Prophet  Joseph, before they started upon their  missions.    Inasmuch as the devil had been in a  measure thwarted by the Twelve going  to Far West, and returning without  harm, it seemed as though the destroyer   was determined to make some other at-  tempt upon us to hinder us from per-  forming our missions; for it seemed that   as soon as any one of the Apostles began   to prepare for starting, he was smitten   with chills and fever or sickness of some  kind.    Nearly all of the quorum of the  Twelve or their families began to be  sick, so it still required the exercise of a  good deal of faith and perseverance to  start off on a mission.    On the 25th of July, for the first time  in my life, I was attacked with chills and   fever; and this I had every other day,  and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-  trate.    My wife, Phoebe, was also soon taken   down with the chills and fever, as were   quite a number of the Twelve.    I passed thirteen days in Montrose   with my family, after I was taken sick,   before I started on my mission.    The 7th of August was the last day I   spent at home in Montrose, and although  sick with the chills and fever the most of  the day, I made what preparations I    [Column 2]  could to start on the morrow on a mis-  sion of four thousand miles, to preach   the gospel to the nations of the earth,  and this, too, without purse or scrip,   with disease resting upon me, and a  stroke of fever and ague once every two   days.    Early upon the morning of the 8th of   August, I arose from my bed of sickness,   laid my hands upon the head of my   sick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I   then departed from the embrace of my  companion, and left her almost without  food or the necessaries of life.    She parted from me with the fortitude  that becomes a Saint, realizing the re-  sponsibilities of her companion. I quote  from my journal:    "Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer;   remember me in your prayers. I leave   these pages for your perusal when I am   gone. I shall see thy face again in the  flesh. I go to obey the commands of  Jesus Christ."    Although feeble, I walked to the  banks of the Mississippi river. There   President Young took me in a canoe  (having no other conveyance) and pad-  dled me across the river.    When we landed, I lay down on a  side of sole leather, by the post office,   to rest.    Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God,   came along and looked at me.    "Well, Brother Woodruff," said he,  "you have started upon your mission."    "Yes," said I, "but I feel and look   more like a subject for the dissecting  room than a missionary."    Joseph replied: "What did you say  that for? Get up, and go along; all   will be right with you!"    I name these incidents that the reader   may know how the brethren of the  Twelve Apostles started upon their mis-  sions to England, in 1839.    Elder John Taylor was going with me,  and we were the first two of the quorum  of the Twelve who started on their  mission.    Brother Taylor was about the only   man in the quorum that was not sick.    Soon a brother came along with a  wagon, and took us in. As we were   driving through the place, we came to  Parley P. Pratt, who was stripped to the  shirt and pants with his head and feet 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  bare. He was hewing a log, preparing  to build a cabin.    He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have   no money, but I have an empty purse,  which I will give you..' He brought it   to me, and I thanked him for it.    We went a few rods further, and met  Brother Heber C. Kimball, in the same   condition, also hewing a log, towards   building a cabin.    He said: "As Parley has given you a   purse, I have got a dollar I will give you   to put in it."    He gave me both a dollar and a bless-  ing.    We drove sixteen miles across a prairie,   and spent the night with a Brother Mer-  rill. The day following we rode ten   miles, to a Brother Perkins', and he took  us in his wagon to Macomb, and from  thence to Brother Don Carlos Smith's.    I rode four hours during the day over  a very rough road of stones and stumps,   lying on my back in the bottom of the  wagon, shaking with the ague, and I   suffered much.    We held a meeting in a grove near   Don Carlos Smith's, and here Elder   Taylor baptized George Miller, who   afterwards was ordained a bishop.    At the meeting the Saints gave us nine  dollars, and George Miller gave us a   horse to help us on our journey.    I rode to Rochester with Father Col-  trin, where I had an interview with   several families of the Fox Island Saints,   whom I had brought up with me from   Fox Islands in 1838. I spent several   days with them and at Springfield, where  Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred   copies, in pamphlet form, of a brief   sketch of the persecutions and sufferings  of the Latter-dav Saints, inflicted by the  inhabitants of Missouri.    We sold our horse, and in company   with Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor and   myself left Springfield, and continued  our journey.    I had the chills and fever nearly every  other day, which made riding in a lum-  ber wagon very distressing to me, es-  pecially when I shook with the ague.    On the 24th of August, we rode to   Terre Haute, and spent the night with  Dr. Modisett. I suffered much with the  chills and fever.    Elder John Taylor up to this time had   appeared to enjoy excellent health, but    [Column 2]  the destroyer did not intend to make  him an exception to the rest of the   Apostles. On the 28th of August, he   fell to the ground as though he had been  knocked down. He fainted away, but  soon revived. On the following day,   however, the enemy made a powerful   attack upon his life. He fainted away  several times, and it seemed as though  he would die. We stopped several hours   with him at a house by the wayside.   We then took him into the wagon and   drove to Horace S. Eldredge's, and   spent the remainder of the day and night   doctoring him.    In the morning Brother Taylor was so   far recovered that he thought he would  be able to ride. So we started on our   journey on the morning of the 30th, and   we traveled forty miles, to Louisville,   and spent the night with the family of   Brother James Townsend.    We felt terribly shaken up, being in   such a weak state. Brother Townsend   was away from home, but we were kindly  entertained by Sister Townsend.    In the morning Elder Taylor, though   very weak, felt disposed to continue his  journey. We traveled fourteen miles to   Germantown. He was quite sick at   night, and the bilious fever seemed to   settle upon him. I was also very feeble,   myself.    On the day following, September 1st,   being Sunday, Brother Taylor concluded  to remain there for the day, and hold a  meeting.    It was a German settlement. He   wished me to speak, and I spoke upon   the first principles of the gospel. He   followed me, and spoke until he was ex-  hausted.    After we returned to the inn where we   were stopping, I was taken with a chill   and fever, and had a very bad night.   Brother Taylor was also very sick.    The following day, September 2nd, was   a painful day to my feelings. It was   evident that Brother Taylor had a settled   fever upon him, and would not be able   to travel.    Father Coltrin was resolved to con-  tinue his journey, and, in conversing   with Brother Taylor, he thought it better   for one sick man to be left than for two,   as I was so sick with the chills and fever   that I was not able to render him any   assistance, nor, indeed, to take care of 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE    [Column 1]  myself. Under these circumstances,   Brother Taylor advised me to continue   my journey with Brother Coltrin, and   make the best of my way to New York.    After committing Elder Taylor into  the hands of the Lord, though painful   to me, I gave him the parting hand and  started. I left him in Germantown,   Wayne County, Indiana, in the hand sof  a merciful God and a kind and benevo-  lent family, who promised to do every-  thing in their power to make him com-  fortable until his recovery.    This they did, though he passed   through a severe course of the billious  fever, and was sick nigh unto death.  Through the mercy of God, however,   he recovered from his sickness, and con-  tinued his journey. We next met in the   City of New York.    I continued my journey with Father   Coltrin, and we reached Cleveland on  the 18th of September. We there took  steamer for Buffalo, but were three days   and a night in a storm before we made   the harbor. We landed at midnight,   and in doing so we ran into a schooner,   and stove it in.    From Buffalo I traveled to Albany in   a canal boat, and had a stroke of the   ague daily.    While on my journey, at Albany, I   took a stage in the night, and rode to  my father's home in Farmington, on the  21st of September.    I was glad to meet with my father's   family and the other members of the  small branch of the Church which ex-  isted there upon this occasion, as I found   them all strong in the faith of the gos-  pel, and glad to meet with me.    I was still suffering with the ague  daily.    On the 27th of September, my grand-  mother (on my mother's side), Anna  Thompson, died at Avon. She was   eighty-four years of age.    It was a singular coincidence that she  with her husband, Lot Thompson, also   Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thomp-  son, all of one family, died when they  were eighty-four years of age. I was  not able to attend my grandmother's   funeral.    On the 4th of October, 1839, my   uncle, Adna Hart, died, aged forty-three   years. I had visited him in his sickness,  and preached the gospel to him, and he    [Column 2]  was believing. I had also been associated   with him from my youth up.    On his death-bed he sent me a request   that I would preach his funeral sermon.  I was having the chills and fever  daily at the time, attended with a very   severe cough, so much so, that my father  thought that I would never leave his   home alive. But when they brought me  the request of my dying uncle, and the   day came for his burial, I told my father  to get his horse and buggy ready, for I   was going to attend the funeral.    He thought I was very reckless in re-  gard to my own life, as I had suffered   with the chills and fever some fifteen   days, and to attempt to speak in my   weak state, and to begin at the same  hour that my chill was to come on,   seemed to him foolhardy.    My parents were quite alarmed, yet  according to my request my father got   up his team, and I rode with him and   my stepmother five miles, through a   cold, chilly wind, and I commenced   speaking to a large congregation, at the  same hour that my chill had been in the   habit of coming on.    I spoke over an hour with great free-  dom, and my chill left me from that   hour, and I had no more attacks for  many days.    On the Monday following, October   17th, I felt sufficiently restored to health   to continue my journey. I took leave of   my father and sister, and left for New   York, where I arrived on the morning   of the 8th of November.    I spent two months and seven days   after my arrival in New York, in travel-  ing and preaching in that city, New  Jersey and Long Island, a portion of the  time with Parley and Orson Pratt. I   had frequent attacks during this time of   the chills and fever, but I preached al-  most daily.    On the 13th of December I attended  our conference in New York City, with   Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder   John Taylor arrived in our midst, and it   was a happy meeting.    He had passed through a severe siege  of sickness after we parted, but through  the mercy of God had been preserved,  and was able to continue his journey.   He also informed us that others of the  Twelve had suffered a great deal of sick-

After spending six days in New York,   Elder John Taylor, in company with   Elder Theodore Turley and myself sailed   out of New York Harbor for Liverpool,   on board the packet ship Oxford, on the  19th of December, 1839.    We took steerage passage, which cost   fifteen dollars each. We had storms and   rough weather, but most of the winds   were favorable for a quick passage.    While on the ship, a Methodist min-  ister got into a discussion with some Cath-  olics who were in the company, and the   arguments of the minister ran rather   more into abuse than sound argument.    Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-  ister that he did not think it was becom-  ing in a daughter to find so much fault   with the mother as they did, for as the   Methodists came out of the Catholics,   Elder Taylor thought the mother had as  much right to enjoy her religion un-  molested as the daughter had. That   ended the argument.    Our company consisted of 109 souls,  composed of Americans, English, Scotch,  Irish, Welsh and Dutch.    We arrived in Liverpool dock on the   11th day of January, 1840, having made  the voyage from New York in twenty-  three days.    On January 13th, 1840, after visiting   Mr. George Cannon, the father of Presi-  dent George Q. Cannon, and his family,   we took cars in the evening, and arrived   in the midst of the Preston branch of   the Saints, built up in 1837, by Elders   Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and   Willard Richards.    We very soon had a pleasant interview  with Elder Willard Richards, who had   remained in Preston to take care of the   Church, while the rest had returned   home to America.    We spent three days at Preston in   visiting the Saints, and on the 17th we  held a council at Elder Richards' home  in that place.    After consulting upon the best course  for us to pursue, it was finally resolved   that Elder John Taylor and Joseph   Fielding go to Liverpool, Elder Wood-  ruff to Staffordshire Potteries, Theodore   Turley to Birmingham, Elder Richards   wherever the Spirit might direct him,    [Column 2]  and that William Clayton preside over  the branch in Manchester.    After various principles of the Church  had been expounded by the Apostles   present, the council adjourned.    Elder Willard Richards had been   called to be one of the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles, but had not yet re-  ceived his ordination.    On the day following I parted with  Elders Taylor and Fielding, who went  to Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,  who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley   and I went to Manchester.    It was the first time I ever visited that   city. I here first met with Elder Wm.   Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-  tion to him, he informed me that one of   the sisters in that place was possessed of   the devil, and he asked me to go and   cast it out of her, thinking that one of   the Twelve Apostles could do anything  in this line he might wish to.    However, I went with him to the   house where the woman lay, in the hands   of three men, in a terrible rage, and   trying to tear her clothing from her.    I also found quite a number of Saints   present, and some unbelievers, who had   come to see the devil cast out and a  miracle wrought.    If I had acted upon my own judg-  ment I should not have attempted to ad-  minister to her with the company pres-  ent, but as I was a stranger there, and   Brother Clayton presided over the   branch, I joined him in administering to   the woman. But the unbelief of the   wicked present was so great, we could   not cast the devil out of her, and she   raged worse than ever.    I then ordered the room to be cleared,   and when the company left the house,   except the few attending to her, we laid   hands upon her, and I commanded the   devil to come out of her, in the name of   Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and   she was entirely cured and fell asleep.    The next day being the Sabbath, she   came before a large congregation of peo-  ple, and bore testimony to what the   Lord had done for her. We had a large  assemblage through the day and evening,   to whom I preached the gospel.    On Monday morning, the devil, not   being satisfied with being cast out of the  woman, entered into her little child,   which was but a few months old. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  I was called upon to visit the child.   I found it in great distress, writhing  in its mother's arms. We laid hands upon  it and cast the devil out of it, and the   evil spirits had no power over the house-  hold afterwards.    This was done by the power of God,   and not of man. We laid hands upon  twenty in Manchester who were sick,   and they were mostly healed.    On the 21st, I arrived in Burslem by   coach, and met, for the first time, with  Elder Alfred Cordon. This being my   field of labor, I stopped and commenced   work.    Elder Turley stopped in the pottery   district some eight days, then went to   Birmingham, his field of labor.    I received a letter on the 10th of Feb-  ruary, from Elder John Taylor, who was   at Liverpool, saying they had commenced   there and baptized ten persons.    I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries,   in Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Lane End,   and several other villages, from the 22nd,   of January until the 2nd of March,   preaching every night in the week and   two or three times on the Sabbath.    I baptized, confirmed and blessed   many, and we had a good field open for   labor. Many were believing, and it ap-  peared as though we had a door open to  bring many into the Church in that part   of the vineyard.    March 1st, 1840, was my birthday,   when I was thirty-three years of age. It   being Sunday, I preached twice through   the day to a large assembly in the City   Hall, in the town of Hanley, and ad-  ministered the sacrament unto the  Saints.    In the evening I again met with a large  assembly of the Saints and strangers, and   while singing the first hymn the Spirit of   the Lord rested upon me, and the voice   of God said to me, "This is the last   meeting that you will hold with this peo-  ple for many days."    I was astonished at this, as I had   many appointments out in that district.    When I arose to speak to the people,   I told them that it was the last meeting   I should hold with them for many days.   They were as much astonished as I was.    At the close of the meeting four   persons came forward for baptism, and   we went down into the water and bap-  tized them.    [Column 2]  In the morning I went in secret before  the Lord, and asked Him what His will   was concerning me.    The answer I got was, that I should   go to the south, for the Lord had a great   work for me to perform there, as many   souls were waiting for the word of the  Lord.    On the 3rd of March, 1840, in fulfill-  ment of the word of the Lord to me, I   took coach and rode to Wolverhampton,  twenty-six miles, and spent the night  there.    On the morning of the 4th I again   took coach, and rode through Dudley,   Stourbridge, Stourport and Worcester,   and then walked a number of miles to   Mr. John Benbow's, Hill Farm, Castle   Frome, Ledbury, Herefordshire. This   was a farming country in the south of   England, a region where no Elder of the  Latter-day Saints had visited.    I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy   farmer, cultivating three hundred acres  of land, occupying a good mansion, and  having plenty of means. His wife, Jane,   had no children.    I presented myself to him as a mission-  ary from America, an Elder of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints, who had been sent to him by the   commandment of God as a messenger of   salvation, to preach the gospel of life   unto him and his household, and the in-  habitants of the land.    Mr. Benbow and his wife received me   with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It   was in the evening when I arrived, hav-  ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach   and on foot during the day, but after  receiving refreshments we sat down to-  gether, and conversed until two o'clock  in the morning.    Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoiced   greatly at the glad tidings which I   brought unto them of the fulness of the  everlasting gospel, which God had re-  vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,  Joseph Smith, in these last days.    I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.  Benbow gave me, that there was a   company of men and women—over six   hundred in number—who had broken off   from the Wesleyan Methodists, and taken  the name of United Brethren. They   had forty-five preachers among them,   and had chapels and many houses that 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  were licensed according to the law of the  land for preaching in.    This body of United Brethren were  searching for light and truth, but had   gone as far as they could, and were con-  tinually calling upon the Lord to open   the way before them, and send them   light and knowledge that they might  know the true way to be saved.    When I heard these things I could   clearly see why the Lord had command-  ed me, while in the town of Hanley, to   leave that place of labor and go to the   south, for in Herefordshire there was a   great harvest-field for gathering many   Saints into the kingdom of God.    I retired to my bed with joy after   offering my prayers and thanksgiving to   God, and slept sweetly until the rising   of the sun.    I arose on the morning of the 5th,   took breakfast, and told Mr. Benbow I   would like to commence my Master's   business, by preaching the gospel to the   people.    He had a large hall in his mansion   which was licensed for preaching, and he  sent word through the neighborhood   that an American missionary would   preach at his house that evening.    As the time drew nigh many of the   neighbors came in, and I preached my  first gospel sermon in the house. I also   preached on the following evening at the  same place, and baptized six persons,   including Mr. John Benbow and his wife,  and four preachers of the United Brethren.    I spent most of the following day in   clearing out a pool of water, and   preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw  many to be baptized there. I afterwards  baptized six hundred in that pool of   water.    On Sunday, the 8th, I preached at   Frome's Hill in the morning, at Stand-  ley Hill in the afternoon, and at John   Benbow's, Hill Farm, in the evening.    The parish church that stood in the   neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, pre-  sided over by the rector of the parish,   was attended during the day by only fif-  teen persons, while I had a large congre-  gation, estimated to number a thousand,   attend my meeting through the day and  evening.    When I arose in the evening to speak   at Brother Benbow's house, a man en-  tered the door and informed me that he    [Column 2]  was a constable, and had been sent by  the rector of the parish with a warrant   to arrest me.    I asked him "For what crime?"    He said, "For preaching to the peo-  ple."    I told him that I, as well as the rec-  tor, had a license for preaching the gos-  pel to the people, and that if he would   take a chair I would wait upon him after  meeting.    He took my chair and sat beside me.   I preached the first principles of the  everlasting gospel for an hour and a   quarter. The power of God rested upon   me, the Spirit filled the house, and the   people were convinced.    At the close of the meeting I opened  a door for baptism, and seven offered  themselves. Among the number were   four preachers and the constable.    The latter arose and said, "Mr. Wood-  ruff, I would like to be baptized."    I told him I would like to baptize   him. I went down to the pool and bap-  tized the seven. We then met together   and I confirmed thirteen, and broke   bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced   together.    The constable went to the rector and   told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff   taken up for preaching the gospel, he  must go himself and serve the writ, for   he had heard him preach the only true  gospel sermon he had ever listened to in   his life.    The rector did not know what to make   of it, so he sent two clerks of the Church   of England as spies, to attend our meet-  ing, and find out what we did preach.    But they were both pricked in their   hearts and received the word of the   Lord gladly, and were baptized and con-  firmed members of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints.    The rector became alarmed and did   not dare to send anybody else.    The ministers and rectors of the South   of England called a convention and   sent a petition to the Archbishop of   Canterbury, to request parliament to  pass a law prohibiting the Mormons   from preaching in the British dominion.    In this petition the rector stated that   one "Mormon" missionary had baptized   fifteen hundred persons, mostly members  of the English church, during the last   seven months. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  But the archbishop and council, know-  ing well that the laws of England gave  free toleration to all religions under the   British flag, sent word to the petitioners  that if they had the worth of souls at   heart as much as they had the ground   where hares, foxes and hounds ran, they   would not lose so many of their flock.    I continued to preach and baptize   daily.    On the 21st day of March I baptized   Elder Thomas Kingston. He was super-  intendent of both preachers and members   of the United Brethren.    The first thirty days after my arrival   in Herefordshire, I had baptized forty-  five preachers and one hundred and   sixty members of the United Brethren,   who put into my hands one chapel and   forty-five houses, which were licensed   according to law to preach in.    This opened a wide field for labor,   and enabled me to bring into the   Church, through the blessings of God,   over eighteen hundred souls during eight  months, including all of the six hundred   United Brethren except one person; also   including some two hundred preachers  of various denominations.    This field of labor embraced Hereford-  shire, Gloucestershire and Worcester-  shire, and formed the conference of Gar-  way, Gadfield Elm and Frome's Hill.    I was visited by President Young and   Dr. Richards.    Brother Benbow furnished us with   £300 to print the first Book of Mor-  mon that was published in England: and   on the 20th of May, 1840, Brigham   Young, Willard Richards and I held a  council on the top of Malvern Hill, and   there decided that Brigham Young go  direct to Manchester and publish 3,000  copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000   copies of the Book of Mormon, this  being the first publication of these books  in England.    The power of God rested upon us and   upon the mission.    The sick were healed, devils were cast   out, and the lame were made to walk.    One case I will mention: Mary Pitt,   who died in Nauvoo, sister to Wm. Pitt,   who died in Salt Lake City, had not   walked upon her feet for eleven years.   We carried her into the water and I bap-  tized her.    On the evening of the 18th of May,    [Column 2]  1840, at Brother Kingston's house in   Dymock, Elders Brigham Young, Wil-  lard Richards and I laid hands upon her  head and confirmed her.    Brigham Young, being mouth, re-  buked her lameness, and commanded  her to arise and walk, in the name of  the Lord. The lameness then left her,   and she never afterwards used a staff or   crutch.    She walked through the town of Dy-  mock next day, which created a stir  among the people; but the wicked did  not feel to give God the glory.    The whole history of this Hereford-  shire mission shows the importance of   listening to the still small voice ot the   Spirit of God and the revelations of the  Holy Ghost.    The Lord had a people there prepared   for the gospel. They were preparing for  light and truth, and the Lord sent me to  them, and I declared the gospel of life   and salvation unto them, and some   eighteen hundred souls received it, and   many of them have been gathered to   Zion in these mountains. Many of them  have also been called to officiate in the  bishopric, and have done much good in   Zion. But in all these things we should   ever acknowledge the hand of God, and   give Him the honor, praise and glory,   forever and ever. Amen.    On the 17th of August 1840, I took  the parting hand of the Saints in Here-  fordshire and started on a mission to   London, in company with Apostles   Heber C. Kimball and George A.  Smith. We rode from Leigh to Chel-  tenham, where we tarried for the night  and in the morning took coach and rode  forty miles through a most delightful   country, which everywhere wore the   golden hue of a plentiful harvest, passed  through Oxfordshire, in sight of Stowe,   the family residence of the Duke of   Buckingham, and at Farmington Station,   took train for London where we arrived  at 4 p. m. We changed conveyance  to the center of the city by omnibus,   walked across London Bridge into the   Borough, and called upon Mrs. Allgood  the sister of Elder Theodore Turley's   wife. She treated us with kindness,   gave us refreshments and then directed   us to a public house, the King's Arms,   King Street, Borough. Here we tarried   for the night. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  We were now in England's great met-  ropolis to sound to it the first procla-  mation of the Latter-day Work: for Heber  C. Kimball, George A. Smith, and my-  self were the three first elders in London  to preach the Gospel and establish the  Church of Latter-day Saints.    We took a walk into the city, passed   London Bridge twice, and returned and   spent the night at the King's Arms.    On the following day we called   upon the Rev. J. E. Smith, Lin-  coln's Inn Fields, also visited John  Pye, 16 Curiosity Street, Chancery  Lane. He was a strong believer in the  prophecies of Joanna Southcott and was   one of the society. We then returned   and had a view of St. Paul's Cathedral,   the largest in the world except St. Peter's   at Rome. We crossed London Bridge,   took tea at 19 King Street, and then   went to Union Chapel, Waterloo Road,   and heard a comical sermon delivered   by an Aitkenite preacher. I spent the   night at 58 King Street at Mrs. Loftus.    The next day, August the 21st, was   the most interesting sight-seeing day in   my life, as far as viewing the splendid   works of man. I started in company   of Elders Heber C. Kimball and George  A. Smith for a walk over the City of   London. We crossed London Bridge,  passed through King William Street,   and several other streets, and visited  Covent Garden; then through St. Mar-  tin Street and Court, Leicester Square,   Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Pica-  dilly, Glass House Street and through   most of Regent Street,—one of the   most splendid streets in the world. We   passed through Langham Place, and All   Souls Church, which has a spire naked   from its base to the top, then through   Oxford Street, and returned by way of   St. Paul's, ending our sight-seeing of the   day by visiting the noted monument   erected in commemoration of the great  fire in London in 1666, and built under  the direction of that famous architect,   Sir Christopher Wren. We entered a   door at its base, paid six pence on enter-  ing, and ascended three hundred and   forty-five black marble steps, which  brought us up two hundred feet into the  air and about one hundred feet higher   than the highest houses. We stepped on  the outside of the pillar, which is sur-  rounded by an iron railing, and here we    [Column 2]  had presented to our view an indescrib-  able scenery on every hand of the great-  est city in the world, which can boast of   a history of nearly two thousand years.   At our feet, as it were, lay a historical   panorama, stretching out to our view   around.    We were situated so as to overlook   nearly every part of the city. East of   us lay the ancient Tower of London;   east of us also lay the Mint; north the   Mansion House of the Lord Mayor of   London; north-west, St. Paul's Church;   west, Westminster Abbey and the House  of Parliament; south lies the River   Thames with five of the large bridges  across in full view and one not seen from  the Monument, making six. These six   bridges are fine sights in themselves.   They are the architectural monuments  of the Thames, and our view of them   from our high pinnacle with their crowds  of moving and ever changing human   masses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages,  drays, etc., which dash along, presented   to us a picturesque sight. In addition  to all this, within our view, was London  Borough, on the south of the river, and   all around us hundreds of churches,   chapels, and spires, standing in the   midst of one universal mass of buildings,  covering about six square miles of   ground. While viewing this prospect on  a clear day, we conversed with a Prussian   traveler, a citizen of Berlin, who had   traveled much over Europe and Asia and  other parts of the world, and he declared   that we could not find another spot on   the face of the earth that would present  to our view so grand a scenery as the   one before us.    August 23rd we went to Zion's chapel   and heard the celebrated Rev. Robert   Aitken preach two sermons. He de-  livered a powerful warning to the   Gentiles, and presented some of the  most sublime truths I ever heard from a   sectarian priest; but he was building   without the foundation.    On the 24th we removed our lodgings  to Mr. Robert Merryfields, No. 15   Gloucester Row, Grange Road, where   we obtained a room for all three of us.    On the 25th of August we attended a   meeting of the Temperance Society, at   their hall, which we engaged, but could   not have it until the 7th of the next   month. Brother Smith made a short 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  speech. On the following day, we  started out to try to get some doors   opened for preaching. Brother Kimball  went to one part of the city and Brother  Smith and myself to another. We called   upon two Baptist ministers and asked   one for his chapel. In the evening we   attended a Methodist meeting in Long   Lane.    Next day we again went to the Tem-  perance Hall, in St. George's Road near   the Elephant and Castle, and by the re-  request of the committee I addressed the  meeting upon the subject of temperance,  followed by George A Smith. We gave  out an appointment to preach the Gos-  pel at that place September 7th.    The day after, we all started out to go  through the city of London to see if we   could find a man with the Spirit of God,  and after wandering through the city,   not knowing whither we went, we came  upon a man and stopped him and spoke  to him. Brother Kimball asked him  if he was a preacher? He said   he was. He seemed to have a good   spirit, and informed us that he had been  to America, and had come to London  for the purpose of going to South Aus-  tralia, but had just buried one child and   another lay at the point of death. Broth-  er Kimball told him his child should   live. He gave us some information   where we could preach. On the same  day we called upon him and found his   child better, but he was not at home.   We then went and heard a Calvinist   preach, and he gave us an invitation to  call and see him.    Next day we again went over the city  to see if we could find any of the chil-  dren of God. We found one man and   his household who received our testi-  mony, and he opened his doors for us to   preach. We appointed a meeting at his   house for Sunday evening. His name   was Corner, and he lived at 52 Iron-  monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near  the church.    We had spent twelve days in going to   and fro through London, trying to find  a people willing to receive our testi-  mony, but finding the doors shut against   us, we determined in the name of God   to go into the streets and lift up our  voices.    Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith,   and myself started out on Sunday morn-    [Column 2]  ing, August the 30th, walked three miles   and stopped in Tabernacle Square, Old   Street, where we found an Aitkenite   preaching to the people, who was fol-  lowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the   latter was about to begin, Elder Kimball  informed him that there was a preacher  from America present who would like to  speak when he got through. The preacher   then informed the people that there was   an American minister present, and pro-  posed that he should speak first. Elder   George A. Smith then got into the chair,  and spoke about twenty minutes, and  then the Presbyterian spoke. George A.  had informed the people that there were  two other American preachers present   who would like to address them, and,   when the Presbyterian closed, Elder   Kimball asked him if there would be any   objection to our preaching there at three  o'clock. He answered, "No, not at all.   What denomination do you belong to?''   "To the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints," was the reply.    "Oh, I have heard of them," he said.  "They are a bad people; they have done   much hurt; they divide churches; we   don't want to hear you."    He then mounted the chair again and   said to the people, "I have just heard  that the last man who spoke belongs to  the Latter-day Saints," and he began to  rail against us.    Elder Kimball asked him to let him   step into the chair to give out an ap-  pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, but  he would not let him. Brother Kimball   then raised his voice and informed the  people that some American preachers   would preach there at 3 o'clock.    At the appointed time we were at the   place. The conduct of the preacher and  the excitement upon the subject brought   a large congregation to hear us. I   opened the meeting by singing and  prayer and spoke about twenty minutes,   from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. I. 8-9 v.##, and was followed by   Elder Kimball for about the same length   of time. The people gave good attention  and seemed to be much interested in   what they heard.    After meeting, Mr. Corner invited us  home; but soon after we arrived, at his   house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to   return to the place of preaching. When   he got there he found a large company   talking about the things which they had 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  heard, and they wished him to speak to   them again. He did so and addressed  them at considerable length, and after-  ward several invited him home to their   houses.    While he was away a man who had   been a preacher came to Mr. Corner's;   I gave him a brief account of the great   work of God in the last days and they   received the things which I spake unto  them. Mr. Corner offered himself for   baptism. This was the first man in the   city of London who offered himself for  the ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-  pointed the next evening to administer  the ordinance of baptism unto him.  After supping with him we returned   home. I was weary and unwell during  the night, but felt thankful unto the   Lord for the privilege of preaching to  the inhabitants of this great city and to  have gained one soul as a seal to our   ministry.    On the 31st of August we reaped the   first fruits of our labors and laid the first   living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ  in England's great metropolis.    We walked into the city and called   upon Mr. Corner, who went forward  with us to the public baths and received  the initiatory ordinance of the Gospel.  He was baptized by Brother Kimball.    Returning to the house of Brother  Corner, Elders Kimball, Smith and my-  self laid our hands upon his head and  confirmed him a member or the Church.   We returned to our homes that night,   thankful unto God for his goodness in  blessing our labors even thus much.    On the 2nd of September I was quite  ill. I had been unwell for several days,   but now I was obliged to keep to my   room; but Elders Kimball and Smith   went into the city to visit the people and   found some who hearkened to them favor-  ably. We had by this time found that   London was the hardest place for a mis-  sion that we had ever undertaken, but   we did not feel discouraged in the least,   and were determined in the name of the  Lord to set up the standard of the King-  dom in that city.    The following day I was still confined  to my room most of the time, but on  the next, Elders Kimball and Smith went   to Debtford, and I took a walk into the   city, called upon Brother Corner and   found him in good spirits. I also called    [Column 2]  upon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,  Basin, who was a director of a Methodist  chapel. I asked him for the chapel to   preach in. He said he had a school   house which would hold two hundred,   and that I might have that on Sunday.   So I gave out an appointment at Bowl   Court, 137 Shordeitch. I conversed   with several others who received my tes-  timony, and one woman said she would  be baptized.    Sunday, September the 6th, I preached   in the morning at Bowl Court, 137  Shoreditch, and was followed by Elders  Kimball and Smith. We also held a   meeting in Tabernacle Square, at 3   o'clock in the afternoon, at which Elders  Kimball and Smith preached and I bore   my testimony to their words. One man   arose and opposed us, and was angry be-  cause of the truth of God. He continued   opposing, until the police stopped the   conversation.    We met again in the evening at Bowl   Court, to preach to the people, but   when we got there we found a plan con-  trived by several of the preachers for   one of them to preach, lest some should   believe our testimony. We went our   way and found four persons who re-  ceived our testimony and offered them-  selves for baptism.    Next day I wrote to Elder Browett of   my Herefordshire field of labor, and   walked to Brother Corner's and visited   several other friends. Two offered them-  selves for baptism. I visited St. Paul's   and then returned home. Elders Kim-  ball and Smith had just returned from a  visit to the Rev. Robert Aitken. He   received them kindly, acknowledged  their doctrine true, but was afraid of   deception. His mind was in a disturbed   state.    In the evening we held a meeting in  the Temperance Hall; but we had al-  most the bare walls to preach to, there   being only about thirty present. I   preached to the few present for about an  hour, and Elder Kimball followed me.   After paying seven shillings and six   pence for the use of the hall we returned   to our lodgings.    On September the 9th I paid my bills   and called upon the friends, in company   of Brothers Kimball and Smith, and on  the day following I parted from the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE    [Column 1]  brethren and friends in London to re-  turn to Herefordshire.    We had spent twenty-three days in   that great Babylon of modern times and   had found it harder to establish the   Church there than in any place where  we had ever been. We had baptized  one man, and ordained him a priest;   and six others had given in their names  to be baptized on the following Sunday;   and at this time there was some little   prospect of the Rev. Robert Aitken re-  ceiving the work. I, therefore, left   London feeling that our mission and  labors had not been altogether in vain.    I was rejoiced on my return to the   churches to find that the work was uni-  versally and rapidly progressing in Here-  fordshire. In some cases it was even   reaching the nobility, and a lady of   title had become convinced of the work   of God through our ministry.    Lady Roberts was of the nobility of   England and a lady of wealth, and had   withdrawn from the Church of England   and had traveled much in search of truth  looking for the fulfillment of the Pro-  phets.    She became acquainted with the ful-  ness of the Gospel through a female  servant in the employ of Squire Dowds-  well. She began to investigate the sub-  ject; the Spirit of God rested upon her  and convinced her of the truth of the   work. She obtained the four numbers   published of the Millennial Star, and,   fearing that she should not be able to   obtain them for herself, copied the   whole of them with her pen. She also   read the Book of Mormon and copied a   part of that, and became perfectly con-  vinced of the truth of the work of   which she read, and said she would go a  thousand miles but what she would see   some of the Twelve and be baptized   under their hands. Hearing that I was   in London she was about to take a   journey there to see me, and the other  brethren, and be baptized. She had   two brothers, ministers of the Church of   England.    On the 21st of September, 1840, we   held the Frome's Hill Conference, at   which were represented 24 churches,   with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,  9 teachers and 1 deacon. The Bran   Green and Frome's Hill Conferences  were now composed of 40 churches,    [Column 2]  1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests,   15 teachers and one deacon.    These two conferences, with their  forty branch churches, and over a thou-  sand organized members, under the di-  rection of one hundred and thirteen   ordained officers, had been raised up  within six months and a half. Surely  the work of Godhad been marvelous,   unparalleled perhaps in the history of  any new religious movement.    I meditated upon these things, and in   my journal of date September 21st,   1840, I wrote thus:    "This has been a busy day with me.  After standing upon my feet from morn-  ing till evening I am called to shake   hands with hundreds of Saints with glad  hearts and cheerful countenances. It is   with no ordinary feelings that I meditate   upon the cheering fact that a thousand   souls have been baptized into the new  and everlasting covenant in about half a   year in one field which God has enabled  me to open. I pray him to accept the  gratitude of my heart for his mercies   and blessings unto me in this thing, and  enable me to stand with these Saints  and all the righteous in His celestial   kingdom."    This day I had stood upon my feet   eight hours in conference, conversed   much of the time in suggesting, speak-  ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about  thirty, confirmed some, healed many   who were sick, shook hands with about  four hundred Saints, walked two miles,  and ended with about four hours chim-  ney corner preaching. I then laid down  to rest and dreamt of catching fish.    The church ministers at this time were   very much stirred up in this region be-  cause of the success of the work of God  in the midst of the people, and every   exertion was made by them to stay its  progress. They were finding that the   Lord was delivering their flocks out of  their hands and giving them unto the   shepherds of the Church of the Saints.   They were alarmed and were holding   conventions and meetings to contrive  plans and adopt means to overthrow the  latter-day work of God, which they un-  derstood not, and believed not, yet   feared its power. And well indeed they  might, for in some instances they did   not have more than ten or fifteen at their 
 [Column 1]  churches on the Sabbath, while around  them on every hand they had seen forty  branches of two organized conferences   of the Church of Latter-day Saints   spring up in about six months, with over  a thousand members and between one   and two hundred officers ordained to  scatter the seed of the Gospel every-  where in this prolific field.    On the 25th, I again took leave of the   Saints in my Herefordshire field of labor    [Column 2]  to attend the conference at Staffordshire,   which was held at Hanley.    The day after the conference I bap-  tized one and preached at Tunstell, and   on the next evening at Burslem to a   crowded audience, and the power of  God rested upon me. Great solemnity   pervaded the congregation. The Spirit   of God was moving the people and they  felt that the Lord was doing a work in  their midst.    -[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  CHAPTER III.    CONTINUATION OF MY MISSION TO ENG-  LAND. ORGANIZATION OF THE LON-  DON CONFERENCE. I BID FAREWELL  TO THE HEREFORDSHIRE SAINTS.   RETURN TO AMERICA.    On the 6th of October, 1840, a   general conference of the British mission   was held at Manchester. There were   present of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham   Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard Rich-  ards, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith and   Wilford Woodruff. The presiding officers   of the mission represented twenty-seven  conferences, besides other churches not  yet organized into conferences. The  number of membership was 3,621, being   an increase since the last general con-  ference of 1,113 members.    The next evening we attended a dis-  cussion held between a sectarian minister   and Elder Alfred Cordon on the subject   of the Book of Mormon. There were   present 1,500 people. This was the first   discussion of any note on Mormonism  held in Great Britain.    I left Manchester on the 14th of October  to return to my labors in London; and   on my way, with Elder Alfred Cordon,  I visited the Staffordshire Potteries and   Birmingham. On the 17th I arrived in   London, where I found Elder George A.  Smith, and we were glad to meet each   other once again.    We hired lodgings, board and sitting   room at No. 40 Ironmonger Row, St.   Luke's. Everything was dear, and we   found with the greatest economy we   could not do with much less than a pound   per week each. What few Saints there   were in London were very poor and    [Column 2]  unable to assist us. Most of the means   used in my labors in London was sup-  plied by my converts of Herefordshire.    The prospect in London at that time   was the darkest I had ever been in since  entering the vineyard, but the Lord was  with us and we were not discouraged.    Sunday we met with the Saints at   Brother Corner's three times, read in the   Book of Mormon, gave instruction and  broke bread unto them. We had a good   time, though there was only about half   a dozen present. I felt the spirit bear  testimony that there would be a work  done in London.    I fell asleep, having retired to rest in   good season, and slept until midnight,  when I awoke and meditated upon the  things of God until 3 o'clock in the morn-  ing, and while forming a determination  to warn the people in London and over-  come the power of darkness by the assist-  ance of God, a person appeared unto me   whom I consider was the prince of dark-  ness. He made war upon me and at-  tempted to take my life. He caught me by   the throat and nearly choked me to death.  He wounded me in my forehead and I   also wounded him in a number of places  in the head. As he was about to over-  come me I prayed to the Father in the   name of Jesus Christ for help. I then  had power over him and he left me,  though much wounded. Afterwards  three persons dressed in white came to   me and prayed with me and I was im-  mediately healed of all my wounds and  delivered of all my troubles.    During the following week we visited  the British Museum and other notable  places, and also attended a Wesleyan   Methodist mission meeting over which  the Lord Mayor presided; while in the 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  performance of our own missionary  labors we circulated and posted hand-  bills. The following is a copy of the  first placard of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints posted in  England's great metropolis.    "He that judgeth a matter before he heareth is  not wise."    THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS meet for pub-  lic worship at Mr. J. Barrett's Academy,  57 King's Square, Goswell Road—(en-  trance door in President Street) every   Sabbath at 3 and half past 6 o'clock p. m.;  also on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings,   each week at 8 o'clock.    LECTURES  will be delivered by Elders Woodruff  and Smith (late from America), who re-  spectfully invite the citizens of London  to attend.    The first principles of the Everlasting  Gospel in its fullness. The gathering of  Israel. The second coming of the Savior   and "the restitution of all things'' spoken  of by all the holy prophets, will be among   the subjects illustrated.    The Latter-day Saints Millenial Star,   published monthly, and other publications  can be had at 52 Ironmonger Row, St.  Luke's. (City press, Long Lane, Doud-  ney & Seryngour.)     The following Sunday we preached for  the first time in Barrett's Academy at  3 o'clock. There were present about   fifty persons, unto whom I preached and   Elder Smith preached in the evening;   but it was the hardest matter to awaken  an interest upon the subject that I had   ever found.    Next day I received a package of letters  from America, one from my wife an-  nouncing the death of my little daughter,  Sarah Emma.    There is so much going on in this great   modern Babylon to draw the attention of   the people that it seemed almost to re-  quire the trumpet's blast from heaven to   awaken the attention of the inhabitants  to our proclamation of the restoration of   the fullness of the Gospel.    We were here like the Apostles of old  without purse or script to warn the City  of London, where we had to pay high  for everything we required, and to pay  for a place to preach in. We were at  this time about out of money, but still  we felt to trust in God.    [Column 2]  November 1st I preached in the after-  noon in the Academy to about thirty,   and in the evening to about fifty. We   broke bread unto the Saints, and this  evening there seemed to be some interest   manifested in inquiring into the work.    We preached again on the following   Sunday. During the week we received  counsel from our brethren of the Twelve  for George A. Smith to go immediately  to the Potteries and spend his time with   the churches there. After his departure  I felt very lonely for several days, but  Elder William Pitt from Dymock came   and labored with me for a short time,  after which he took a mission to Ipswich.    Brother Hulme, a captain of one of   the "Pickford's Boats" on the London   Canal, was present at my next preaching  after the departure of Elder Pitt, and   with him were two of his hands whom  he had baptized. On the following day  I dined with him and the two brethren  on board their boat.    On the afternoon and evening of Sun-  day, the 22nd of October, I held public  meeting at the Academy, when four   offered themselves for baptism; and on  the following Sunday I again preached  twice and baptized and confirmed three  more. These were the first fruits of my  labors in London.    Next day I took a very interesting  walk with Dr. Wm. Copeland through   every part of the College of Surgeons at  Lincoln's Inn Fields, and on my return  home I was soon joined by Elders Brig-  ham Young and Kimball, who had come   to spend a week or two in London. This   was the first time ever President Brigham  Young was in the metropolis of Eng-  land.    We met for service at the Academy   Wednesday evening, when Brother Brig-  ham preached, followed by Brother   Heber. We had a good time.    In company with Presidents Young   and Kimball on the 3rd of December I   visited the Tower of London, without   seeing which the traveler would lose a   capital page of the history of his travels  in Europe, and during the week also   visited St. Paul's, Buckingham Palace,  Westminster Abbey, the Queen's stables,   and saw many other noted sights of   London.    Sunday we held public meeting at the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  Academy, at which there were about fifty  present. Brother Kimball preached.    An Independent minister invited me  home to take tea with him. I accepted   his invitation, had an interesting time  and preached the Gospel to him and he  received my testimony and offered me his  chapel, which would hold 800. He said he  thought he would be baptized and would  try and get his society to do the same.    We met again in the evening and had   more at our meeting than ever before.  Brother Brigham Young preached and   was followed by Brothers Kimball, Wil-  liams, Corner, Hulme and myself.    We had a very interesting time and   one offered himself for baptism. There  were some of the Aikenites present, one   of whom purchased a hymn book. They   wished us to call upon them and thought  they would be baptized. We then met   at Father Corner's and communed with  the Saints and had a good time.    I rejoiced at the prospect which was   opening before us, for we labored a long   time and the work had gone slow, but   now a wide opening was being made to   roll on the work of the Lord in the me-  tropolis of England.    Having spent about ten days in Lon-  don President Young left for Cheltenham.  On the same day I visited Mr. James   Albon, a minister of the Independent  order, who with his household believed   our doctrine, and on the Sunday we found   more than ever an interest being awak-  ened in London, and our prayer meeting  the next evening was attended by the   Reverend James Albon, who received our   testimony. We walked home with him   and found his household growing in the   faith and ready for the work of the Lord.    Two days after in the evening we bap-  tized four, two of whom were Mr. and  Mrs Morgan, with whom we lodged,   Christopher, Smith their apprentice, and  Henry Corner, Jun.    The afternoon of the following day  Dr. Copeland spent with us, and he re-  ceived our testimony, and in the evening   we preached at our meeting place.    I had visited the Rev. James Albon   several times and given him an account   of the rise and progress of the Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   He believed in our mission and offered   me his chapel to preach in, which would   seat about a thousand.    [Column 2]  Sunday morning we accompanied our   reverend friend and convert to his chapel  and were introduced to the committee,   one of whom was a preacher who had  traveled much in Russia and other parts   of the world. At the close of the meet-  ing the Rev. James Albon gave out an   appointment for us to preach on the next   Sabbath evening.    In the afternoon we met with the  Saints, confirmed four and had a full   house, and in the evening we preached  again and a good feeling prevailed.    After meeting the Rev. James Albon   called upon us at our room and told us   that he had given out our appointment  to preach in his chapel and had informed  his congregation that he was a Latter-day   Saint, and should be baptized and join   our Church, and that they need not  longer consider him a member of their   body unless they with him joined the  Saints. He told us this made a division   among the committee; some were for   going with him and some against follow-  ing their pastor into the true fold which   he had found.    The Sunday following in the evening   we preached, by the appointment of its  minister, in the Independent chapel to  the largest congregation we had ever dis-  coursed before in London. There were    present priests and people of many de-  nominations. I addressed them for  about the space of one hour. A Wes-  leyan minister arose and opposed me,  which had a good effect, for the congre-  gation seeing the spirit he was of turned   against him, and the committee refused   him the permission to speak there any   more. I was much bound by the oppos-  ing spirit, still the conduct of the enemy   gave us friends.    The next evening we attended what   was said to have been the largest temper-  ance meeting ever held in London, and   the next two days brought us to the  close of the year.

Traveled 4,469 miles;   held 230 meetings, and established 53  places for preaching; I planted 47   churches and jointly organized them.  These churches were chiefly comprised  in the two conferences raised up in Here-  fordshire, consisting of about 1,500   Saints, 28 elders, no priests, 24 teachers,   and 10 deacons.    The baptisms of the year were three   hundred and thirty-six persons under my   own hands, and I assisted in the baptism  of eighty-six others. I baptized 57   preachers, mostly of the connection of   the United Brethren, and also 2 clerks of  the Church of England. I confirmed   420, and assisted in confirming 50 others.  I ordained 18 elders, 97 priests, 34   teachers and 1 deacon. I blessed 120   children, and administered to 120 sick   by prayer, anointing and the laying on   of hands, and in many instances the   sick were healed, and devils cast out. I   assisted in procuring £1,000 for the pub-  lication of 3,000 copies of the hymn   book, 5,000 copies of the Book of Mor-  mon, and for the printing of the Mil-  lennial Star, and to assist two hundred  Saints to emigrate to Nauvoo. I wrote   200 letters and received 112.    The new year, 1841, found Elder   Kimball and myself in the metropolis of   England in the enjoyment of good   health. We celebrated New Year's day  by baptizing two into the fold of Christ.   The church in London now numbered  twenty-one members.    The next Sunday we held a meeting in  the Academy, confirmed two, and par-  took of the sacrament.    During the week I baptized the   daughter of the Rev. James Albon, and   the day after Elder Kimball started to   Woolwich to break up new ground. On  the Sunday he preached there for the   first time, when four persons offered   themselves for baptism. Next day they  came to London, and we immediately   repaired to our private bath in Taber-  nacle Square, and Elder Kimball bap-  tized five persons, one of whom was Dr.   Wm. Copeland.    This was indeed an interesting occa-  sion and we felt thankful to God to see  the cloud beginning to break, for we had   struggled hard to do the little which had   been done.    [Column 2]  On the 15th of the month we baptized   three more of Brother Morgan's house-  hold, and on the following Sunday I   preached to a full house and to many  new hearers. Several offered themselves   for baptism, and there had been during   the week added unto the Church seven   souls.    Next day Elder Kimball received a   letter from Elder Young, who wished us  to be ready to set sail for home early in   April.    Several days later I baptized the Rev.   James Albon and Mr. Hender, and be-  fore the close of January I baptized three  others into the Church.    I visited Greenwich and Woolwich,   where Elder Kimball had raised up a   small branch of the Church. I returned  to London with Elder Kimball. On the   Sunday we communed with the Saints,  and in the evening we both preached to  a full congregation.    On the 8th of February, having re-  ceived a package of twenty Books of   Mormon and two dozen hymn books.  Heber C. Kimball and myself went to   Stationer's Hall and secured the copy-  right of the Book of Mormon in the   name of Joseph Smith, Jr. We left five   copies of the book, and paid three shil-  lings for the copyright.    In the evening we baptized four per-  sons, one of whom was the wife of Rev.   James Albon, who had already received   the Gospel.    Elder Brigham Young, per letter, in-  formed us of the large emigration of  that season. There were to go on one   ship 235, and on another 100.    To the reader acquainted with the im-  mense emigrations of the Saints in later   years, our consideration of the sailing of   three or four hundred as a large emigra-  tion will be noteworthy.    Elder Lorenzo Snow arrived in Lon-  don on the 11th, to take charge of the   Church after our departure. I was truly  glad to once more greet him for I had   not seen him since 1837.    On the same day Elder Wm. Pitt also   arrived at our lodgings, and we had an  interesting meeting in the evening.   Brother Snow preached, and Elder Kim-  ball and myself followed him, and the   next day Brothers Heber and Lorenzo   went to Woolwich to give impetus to 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  the work of God in that important town.    MINUTES  of the First London Conference, held at  the Academy, 57 King's Square, Goswell  Road, February 14th, 1841.    There were present of officers of the   Church, Elders H. C. Kimball, Wilford   Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow and Wm. Pitt,  besides 4 priests.    The meeting was called to order by   Elder H. C. Kimball, at 2 o'clock p. m.,  Sunday, the 14th of February, 1841,   when it was moved by Elder Kimball,   and seconded by Elder Pitt, that Wilford   Woodruff be the president of the Con-  ference.    Moved by Elder Kimball and seconded   by Elder Woodruff, that Dr. Wm. Cope-  land be the clerk. Carried unanimously.    The meeting was then opened by sing-  ing, and prayer from Elder Kimball.    The president then called for the   representation of the branches of the  London Conference.    The Church at Bedford was represented   by Priest Robert Williams, containing   42 members and one priest; seven re-  moved, and two dead.    The Church at Ipswich, represented   by Elder Wm. Pitt, consisted of 12   members, 1 elder, 1 priest and 1 teacher.    The Church at Woolwich, represented  by Priest John Griffith, consisted of 6   members and 1 priest.    The Church at London, represented   by H. C. Kimball, consisted of 46 mem-  bers, 1 elder and 2 priests. Excellent   prospect of continued increase.    ORDINATIONS.  Moved and seconded by Elders Kim-  ball and Woodruff, that James Albon be  ordained an elder; moved and seconded  by Elders Kimball and Snow, that   Thomas Barnes be ordained a teacher;  moved and seconded by Elders Kimball   and Pitt, that Robert Williams be or-  dained an elder to oversee the Church at   Bedford; moved and seconded by Elders   Robert Williams and Pitt, that Wm.   Smith, at Bedford, be ordained a priest;   moved and seconded by Elders Kimball   and Pitt, that Richard Bates be ordained   a priest in the Woolwich branch; moved   and seconded by Elders Robert Williams  and Pitt, that John Sheffield be ordained   a teacher at Bedford; moved and sec-    [Column 2]  onded by Elder Kimball and Brother  Griffith, that Brother A. Painter be or-  dained a teacher at Woolwich. These   motions were carried unanimously, and  those present were then ordained under  the hands of Elders Kimball, Woodruff   and Snow.    Afterward Elder Kimball moved and   Elder Woodruff seconded that Elder   Lorenzo Snow be appointed president of  this Conference and to lake the superin-  tendency of the Church in London.    Much valuable instruction was given   by Elders Kimball and Woodruff in re-  lation to the duties of official members,   and afterward it was moved by Elder  Kimball and seconded by Elder Snow   that this Conference be adjourned till   Sunday the 16th of May, 1841; after   which the Conference closed.    WILFORD WOODRUFF, President.  DR. WM. COPELAND, Clerk.    During this Conference meeting we   also broke bread with the Saints and con-  firmed four. At half-past 6 in the evening,   we met again and had the largest con-  gregation which had assembled at our   preaching place. One came forward for  baptism.    This was a day which we had long de-  sired to see, for we had labored exceed  ingly hard to establish a Church in Lon-  don and at times it seemed as though we  should have to give it up, but by holding   on to the work of our Divine Master and   claiming the promises of God, we were   now to leave an established London Con-  ference with a prosperous Church planted  in the metropolis, under the care of our   beloved Brother Lorenzo Snow.    Brother Kimball, on the 15th, received  a letter from his wife, informing us that  the Prophet Joseph had written for the   Twelve to come immediately home.    At this time there was a prospect of   war between America and England, over   the imprisonment of McCloud, a British  officer, by the State of New York, and   the northeastern boundary question.   In consequence of this prospect the   Prophet Joseph wrote for the Twelve to   come home, after first thoroughly organ-  izing the British mission and calling out   a number of native elders to send in  every direction throughout Great Britain.    I spent the 25th of February in visit-  ing the Saints previous to my departure   and in the evening preached for the last 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    [Column 1]  time in London before my return to  Nauvoo. Next day I parted from Lor-  enzo Snow and the London Saints and   took train for Bristol, to visit the branch   which had been raised up there by my  convert Elder Thomas Kington, who it   will be remembered was the superin-  tendent of the Frome's Hill Circuit of  United Brethren.    Leaving Bristol I visited the churches  which I had raised up, for the purpose of   holding conferences and bidding farewell  to the Saints, hundreds of whom I had   myself baptized.    When I arrived at Monmouth, Elder   James Morgan was waiting my coming,   and had given out an appointment for  me to preach in the town at 7 o'clock, at  the house of Robert Davis. There was a   crowded meeting and many could not get  into the house. Four offered themselves  for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me  that there would many embrace the Gos-  pel in Monmouthshire, and I said, "the  harvest is great and the laborers few."    I arose in the morning refreshed by  sleep, and having taken breakfast with   Mr. Matton, I walked ten miles through  mud and water in a driving March rain  storm to sister Mary Morgan at Little  Garway, where I found a pleasant family   of the Saints. We were drenched with   rain but found a good fire and spent the  day comfortably and in the evening I had  an interesting interview with Elder Little-  wood; the next day at Sister Morgan's,   reading the history of Rome, with much  interest, and in the evening I met the   officers of the Church there in council and   had a good time. Sunday I preached in  the morning at the house of Brother  Thomas Rood, and in the evening at the  Kitchen upon the Book of Mormon, and   had the place full.    The Garway Conference, held March   8th, 1841—I met the Garway conference  at the Kitchen. Elder Levi Richards was  chosen president and Elder James Mor-  gan, clerk. There were present one of   the Quorum of the Twelve, one High   Priest, seven Elders, eleven Priests, two  Teachers and one Deacon. The meeting   opened with prayer by Elder Woodruff,   after which the churches were represented  as follows: Members, 134; Elders, 4;  Priests, 5; Teachers, 3; Deacons, 1.    After the representation it was moved   that John Needham be ordained elder,    [Column 2]  William Morris priest and Thomas Rough  teacher. These were ordained under the   hands of Elders Woodruff and Richards.  The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and  one person was baptized.    In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards   spoke and I followed him. After meet-  ing the Saints contributed one pound to   help me, and sold them three books of   Mormon and fifty addresses to the citi-  zens of London. I then walked five   miles with Brother Richards to Brother   Holley's and spent the night. This was   the first time I had seen Brother Levi for   about two years.    Next day in company of Elders Levi  Richards and Thomas Pitt I walked to   the city of Hereford, where Elder Ray   and others had been preaching.    On Sunday a preacher arose before two   or three thousand people in the market  house and informed the multitude that  he had a fresh letter direct from America,   showing the origin of the Book of Mor-  mon. So he read the old Spaulding  story. When he got through Elder Levi   Richards arose and informed the people  that instead of its being a new story it  had been published for seven years   throughout the United States and in  England. This caused a great uproar, for   while some were for driving the man out  of the place for lying, others were crowding  around Elders Richards and Ray to hear   them preach. The crowd, however, was so   excited that they left the ground with   hundreds following them. There never   was a time when the people were so much  stirred up and eager to hear the Latter-  day Saints as at the present, and it was  expected that we should not get through  the city without having crowds around  us. We did, however, and had a view of   Hereford Cathedral as we passed along   and reached Sister Bufton's.    There was at this time a small branch  of the Church at Hereford, numbering  seven members. We parted from Brother  Pitt at Hereford, and continued to Lug-  wardine, where I met with the Church for  the last time and preached from the ##Isaiah 24|24th##   of Isaiah.    On the morrow I walked to Shucknell   Hill and had an interesting meeting with  the Saints and preached upon the gather-  ing to Zion and Jerusalem. It was my  last meeting with them and I bid them  farewell. Next day I walked to Standley 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  Hill and dined with Brother Ockey, whom  I was truly glad to see once more. We   went together through Standley Hill and  called upon the Saints. Six months had  passed since I had parted from the   churches in this region, but now I was   again in the field where the Lord by His   blessing and the power of the Holy  Ghost had made my labors so abundantly  fruitful.    Next day I went to Greenway and   preached, blessed a child, confirmed a  member and administered the ordinance  of the Gospel to five sick persons; and  on the morrow continued to Turkey Hill.   Here on the Sunday I communed with   the saints and preached to a large con-  gregation upon the gathering. I found  the Saints in the region around very de-  sirous to gather to the body of the   Church, but they were poor and had not  the means.    Conference at Gadfield Elm Chapel.—   On the 15th day of March, 1841, the   Bran Green and Gadfield Elm con-  ference again assembled, when the meet-  ing was called to order by Elder Wood-  ruff.    There were present one of the quorum   of the Twelve Apostles, 1 high priest; 10   elders 21 priests 6 teachers and 1  Deacon, besides the congregation of the  Saints. There were represented nineteen  churches; 367 members, 8 elders, 33   priests, 11 teachers, 1 deacon, removed  41, died 1, expelled 2.    WILFORD WOODRUFF, President.   JOHN HILL, Clerk.    We had a very interesting time at the   conference and a large assembly of the   Saints. It was the last time that I should   attend in that part of my old and beloved   field of labor, during my present mission  to England, and whether or not I should   ever meet here in a conference assembly   of Saints again was one of the secrets of   my future life for time to reveal. We   had held our meeting without disturbance  from the mob who were present, for  they were kept quiet by the police in at-  tendance who were in disguise.    No sooner had the meeting closed than  multitudes of the Saints crowded around  me and hands were presented me on   every side, to bid me farewell. Many  called for me to bless them before I de-  parted. Others cried out, "Lay hands  upon me and heal me before you go."    [Column 2]  One came with, "Brother Woodruff, I am   turned out of doors for my religion;   what shall I do?'' Another with, "I am   ready to go to Zion, but my wife won't go   with me; shall I leave her to gather with  the Saints?" A wife in turn says, "My   husband beat me and turned me out of   doors because I have been baptized. I   have money enough to carry me and the  children to Zion; will you let me go with-  out him?" "Brother Woodruff, my   mother is over 80 years of age and has   willed me 60 pounds at her death, but   will not emigrate with me; must I stay   for her to die or leave her now to go with   the Saints?" One said, "I have sold   my little place and shall have 30 pounds   to-morrow, but must go out into the  street. I have not enough to carry my  family to America; can you help me to a   few pounds or tell me what to do?" And  an Elder cried out, "How much longer   must I preach in England before you will  let me go to America?" "Brother Wood-  ruff, would you come and preach in Chel-  tenham?" "My head is in great pain,   would you heal me? " "I want you to   consecrate this bottle of oil before you  go?" "Will you write to me?" "I   have been waiting a long time to get a   chance to speak to you; good by, remem-  ber me to Mrs. Woodruff, good by! God   bless you!''    Thus was I for more than an hour after   the close of the meeting assailed with   the affectionate outbursts and adieus and   a host of perplexities of these Saints who  crowded around me as children to their  father.    Many of the Saints parted from me  in tears and many followed me to   Turkey Hill where I spent the night and   they filled the house until a late hour,   begging counsel and instruction of me.  One of these was a Baptist minister who   had just been baptized into the Church.    On the morrow, in company with El-  der Needham, I walked to Keysend   Street, where I preached to a crowded   congregation of Saints. On the follow-  ing day I walked to Wind Point, where  I visited the Saints, and thence con-  tinued to Colwall. Here I met with a  large congregation of Saints and   preached to them upon the gathering.    Next day, with Elder Levi Richards, I   walked over Malvern Hill and called   upon Elder Samuel Jones; thence

[Column 1]  through Great Malvern to Crowcat; I   held a meeting at Brother George Brooks'  and had an interesting time with a large   number of Saints whom I had baptized   about a year before. I went to Dunclose   the day after, visiting many of the Saints  by the way, laying hands upon the sick,   and blessing and counseling others of the  flock. They all were happy to see me,   for I had baptized most of them when I   first opened that field of labor. Next   day we traveled to Frome's Hill, and   visited the Saints by the way.    At Frome's Hill I met with the Saints   on Sunday morning, and had a crowded   house; in the afternoon we held a meet-  ing at Standley Hill, where I communed   with the church. At the close of the  meeting I had a busy time shaking hands   with the Saints and parting from them.   Many of them wished me to bless them,  and others to heal them. I spent the  night with Brother Levi Richards at   Elder Edward Ockey's, and on the mor-  row we held the Frome's Hill conference  at Standley Hill.    There were present of the traveling   high council, 2 high priests, 20 elders,   30 priests, 9 teachers, and 2 deacons.    After calling the meeting to order, I   moved that Elder Levi Richards should   preside over the conference, and he was  sustained by the meeting. I was chosen   clerk.    After singing and prayer, the presi-  dent called upon the officers for the rep-  resentation of the various branches,   which was given as follows: branches,   33; members, 957; elders, 24; priests,   68; teachers, 27; deacons, 8.    Robert Gummery, Edward Philips and   John Spires were ordained to the office  of elder, under the hands of Elders   Richards, Kington and myself; Thomas  Bishop to the office of priest, and Wm.   Rowley to the office of deacon.    In the afternoon, after speeches from  Elders Richards and Kington, I delivered   my farewell address and pronounced the  benediction on the conference.    After the meeting was dismissed, I was  almost three hours shaking hands with  the Saints, healing the sick and giving   counsel to the multitude who surrounded   me, many of whom were in tears when   we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to ask  me to take them to Zion, when I had not  means to take myself. I, however, gave    [Column 2]  Sister Foxal five pounds to help her and   her husband and children to the land of   America. She had made every exertion   for six months to save money to gather   with the Saints, and had raised thirty   pounds. The five pounds I gave to her  was a donation from Elder Edward   Ockey, who was imparting of his sub-  stance to help the poor of the church to  gather.    After bidding the multitude of Saints  farewell, I went to Elder Ockey's, to   spend the night, accompanied by Elders  Richards, Kington and Ray.    We had been in the house but a short   time when three of Edward Ockey's   brothers came in for the purpose of hav-  a contest, because their brother and sis-  ter had embraced the gospel and was  about to gather with the Saints. They   manifested much wrath against me, and,   after conversing with them about three   hours, they left the house, and we were  once more in peace.    After conversing together until the  third watch of the night, we retired to   rest, closing one of the busiest days of  my life.    I arose in the morning, refreshed by   sleep, and, after conversing several hours   with Elders Richards, Kington, Kay,   Ockey and others, I was under the ne-  cessity of parting with the Saints in this   region.    In bidding them farewell I found in   our hearts and memory of our associa-  tion many ties which bound me to those  I were leaving behind and among the  faithful ones were the Ockeys.    Brother Edward Ockey and his sister   Ann were of a good and wealthy family.   They had many trials to pass through to   do the will of God and to gather with   the Saints, for their brothers were exceed-  ingly set against them. But Brother   Edward had maintained his integrity like  a man of God and was making every  preparation to gather with the Saints, but  his sister Ann had fears that her brothers   would hinder her gathering.    Having bid farewell to the Saints of   Standley Hill, I walked to Frome's Hill  and conversed with the elders until two   o'clock, when I took the parting hands   of Elders Richards, Kington, Ray and  others, and with my carpet bag with about   20 pounds weight in it, walked fifteen   miles to Worcester in four hours. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    [Column 1]  When I arrived there I was so very  lame and weary with my heavy load and  fast walking that I could scarcely walk  at all. I then took rail and arrived in  Birmingham at 10 o'clock at night, but  was exceedingly lame and weary. I   spent the night with Elder James Riley,   24 Park Street.    I had now fairly ended my Hereford-  shire mission, and bidden a last farewell   to that field of labor where the Lord had  blessed me beyond all my expectations.    I now left three conferences in the re-  gion which I opened one year before, on  the 5th of the same month that I left this   vineyard, planted all over with churches,   numbering fifteen hundred Saints.    The minutes which I have recorded   will show at a glance the rise and pro-  gress of the churches in Herefordshire,   and the regions around.    On Sunday, the 28th of March, the   Staffordshire conference met, and there   were present of the Twelve, George A.   Smith and Wilford Woodruff, with 1   high priest, 13 elders, 28 priests, 10   teachers, and 8 deacons. The confer-  ence was held in the Magistrate's Assem-  bly Room.    At the close of the conference it was  voted that "this conference grant unto   Elders Woodruff and George A. Smith a   letter of recommendation manifesting  that the Church in this region accept of   their labors and consider that they have  filled their mission with honor and dig-  nity."    We had a very interesting time on this   occasion. The conference was held in a  place which would hold 800 and it was   crowded; but there was perfect order   and much good feeling manifested dur-  ing the day. There was prospect of a  continued increase in the Potteries.    George A. Smith was the president of   the conference and T. J. Fitcher and O.  Shaw, clerks.    Next day George A. Smith and my-  self met the officers in council at the  Hanley Meeting Rooms and gave such  advise as we deemed wisdom, and then   took our farewell.    On the following day we also parted   from the Saints at Burslem, took coach  to Manchester, and called upon Parley  P. Pratt, 47 Oxford Street, and found  him and his family enjoying good health.    On the 6th of April, 1841, the general    [Column 2]  conference of the British mission was  held in Carpenter's Hall, Manchester, at  which there were present nine of the  quorum of the Twelve, namely: Presi-  dent Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,   Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Orson  Pratt, Willard Richards, Wilford Wood-  ruff, John Taylor, and George A. Smith.   The total members of the British mission   at that time was represented as 5,814, and  800 besides had emigrated to America  under the shipping arrangements of the  Church. At this conference the Twelve  blessed and set apart Orson Hyde for his   mission to Jerusalem to which he had   been called by the Prophet Joseph.    This was the first and only time in this   dispensation that the Twelve Apostles sat   in conference as a quorum in a foreign   land.    Immediately after the general confer-  ence, those of the Twelve who were   about to return home hastened to Liver-  pool and embarked for America on the   20th of April, on board of the ship  Rochester. Next day, the wind being  favorable, the ship weighed anchor.   There were on board Brigham Young,   Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, George   A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, Willard   Richards and John Taylor, of the Twelve,   with Elder Reuben Hedlock and 120 of  the British Saints.    On our passage across the Atlantic we   had some very tempestuous weather and   became familiar with "a storm at sea."    On the 20th of May we landed in New   York, and on the next day George A.   Smith and myself took up our abode for   a few days at Brother Foster's. While   here I met my brothers-in-law, Ezra and   llus Carter, and also Dr. Charles Fabyan,   my wife's relative.    On the 22nd of May, at the house of   Brother Foster and in the presence of the   quorum of the Twelve, I performed the   service of marriage between Mr. Edward   Ockey and Miss Eliza Brewer, both of   them my converts of Castle Frome.   This was the first marriage ceremony at   which I officiated.    On the 2nd of June I arrived at   Scarborough per stage, and was per-  mitted to embrace my wife, and also my   first born son, whom I had not before  seen. After two years of separation  from my wife, it was a happy reunion   indeed. Here I staged with my father- 
 [Column 1]  in-law until the 5th of July, and then  left for my native place, Farmington,  where I arrived the third day after.    While tarrying at my father's house I  married my sister Eunice Woodruff to  Mr. Dwight Webster. At my sister's  marriage there were between forty and  fifty persons, mostly our relatives. This  was on the 4th of August, 1841.    A few days afterwards my aunt Bulah  Hart was baptized into the Church, and  on the 18th of the month I bade fare-  well to my father's house after a stay of  forty-one days. This was a longer visit  than I had paid to any of my friends for  the last ten years.    On the 9th of September, a little  company, consisting of myself, wife and  son, and four others,started on board the  boat Sandusky for Albany. Our ulti-  mate destination was Nauvoo, where we  arrived on the 5th of the next month.    When I left Nauvoo, two years before,  there were not more than a dozen houses    [Column 2]  in the place, but, on my return to the  city, there were several hundred.    We passed by the Temple, then build-  ing, and had a view of it; we then  called at the house of Elder Brigham  Young, and there spent the night.    Brother Brigham was sick, and Heber  C. Kimball and Willard Richards were  with him. We laid hands upon him and  he soon recovered.    I saw many of my old friends and ac-  quaintances, and was informed that others  of them were dead.    I met with many friends on the day  after my return to Nauvoo, and also sat  in counsel with the Twelve and was  happy once more to meet with my  quorum. I moved my things to Elder  Kimball's. My wife and child were sick.    On the 30th of October the city coun-  cil met and among its business I was ap-  pointed one of the city council of  Nauvoo.    -[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 Afternoon Session, 2 p.m  _____  President W. Woodruff  Stepped forward to the breastwork   of the stand and said: Before dis-  missing this Conference I want to   say a few words to the Latter-day   Saints. The Lord has said by reve-  lation, to those who hold the   keys of the Kingdom of God:   "Whomsoever thou shalt bless   I will bless and whomsoever   thou shalt curse I will curse."    I have traveled something like a   hundred and seventy-five thousand   miles in my day and time, and I   have preached the Gospel to the   nations, to the islands of the sea and   to my own country. I have met,   in some instances, men who pro-  fessed to have faith in God and to   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,   who have stood up before me and   cursed the Prophet of God, Joseph   Smith and blasphemed the name of   God. But in the midst of all these   things, I have never seen a moment   of my life when I felt to curse any-  body. I hope I never shall. But I   have told these men, under these   circumstances, that the curse of God   would overtake them; and in no   instance, when I have been moved   upon to say that, has it ever fallen   unfulfilled; for they have been   marked cases of the judgments   of God overtaking them. But   with regard to blessing, I will   say, if there was ever an   hour in my life that I felt to bless   the Latter-day Saints, it is at the   present time. My heart is drawn   out with love and gratitude towards   God and my brethren with whom I   am surrounded. I have been sus-  tained as a weak instrument in the   hands of God as the President of   this Church. Since I have been   called to this office I have been sus-  tained by the Latter-day Saints,   and for over fifty years of my life   as an Apostle. Why should not   my heart be drawn out in love to-  ward such a people? The world   know not the love of the Latter-day   Saints. They do not comprehend   it. It never entered into their   souls. I am surrounded here with   Prophets, Apostles, Elders and   Saints of the living God; and in the   morning of the resurrection, when   they come out of their graves, they   will pass by the Gods and the   angels who are set there to watch   the interests of the celestial world;   they will go to those thrones, king-  doms, principalities and powers   which have been ordained of God   for them to occupy – those who   dwell in this dispensation as well as   in other ages of the world. If I am   faithful, I shall meet you there; I   shall meet this people there; I shall  meet these Saints of the Living God   there. Therefore, I feel it is my   privilege to bless the Latter-day   Saints. I cannot go abroad, as a   man, and spread this Gospel to the   world and administer to them the   ordinances thereof, to have any   effect, without the Holy Priesthood;   and I, as a man, cannot bless the   inhabitants of the earth, so that the   Lord is bound to acknowledge it,   only by the power of the Holy   Priesthood; and that power I feel   to exercise at the present time in   blessing my brethren and sisters.    In the name of the Lord Jesus   Christ, I feel to bless my Councillors   – Presidents Geo. Q. Cannon and   Jos. F. Smith. They have stood by   me in all the labors of life, as far as   we have been associated, since we   have entered into the new and ever-  lasting covenant. On the same prin-  ciple, I feel to bless these Apostles   who surround me. We have been   united. We are united in the Gospel   of Jesus Christ, and they have the   gratitude of my heart for the labors   of love and life which they have   carried out in their day and time.   I feel to bless the Presidents of the   Seventies, with all their quorums in   this Church, with every blessing that   I have power to bestow upon them,   as a servant of the Living God.   I feel to bless the High Priests,   who bear the high and   Holy Priesthood after the order of   Melchisedec – their Presidents and all   who belong to the quorums. I also   feel to bless the thousands of the   Elders of Israel who have entered   into covenant with the Lord, who   have received a portion of the Mel-  chisedec Priesthood, and who have   gone forth and been faithful in the   ordinances of the House of God. I  feel to bless the Bishopric and the  Lesser Priesthood, which is after  the order of Aaron - the first Priest-  hood sealed upon the heads of Jo-  seph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by  John the Baptist, who held it, and  who laid down his own life for the  word of God and testimony of Jesus  Christ. I feel to bless these Latter-  day Saints, as fathers and mothers,   as borthers and sisters, in  all the ordinance of the House 
 of God. I feel to bless them   and their families, and their flocks,   and in their herds, and in all they   put their hands unto. As far as I   have the power to bless, they have   the blessings of my heart and my   spirit, in every sense of the word.   And I say to all Israel, God bless   you.    Let us live, brethren and sisters,   that when we have finished our   work and our testimony, as other   generations have done, we will re-  ceive the same exaltation and   glory. The world do not know you.   The world do not know this work.   They do not understand it. They   have not entered into the spirit of it;   they never will, except they obey   the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the   law of the celestial kingdom. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Truth and Liberty.    No. 7 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, FEBRUARY 3, 1894. Vol. XLVIII.    THE POWER OF FAITH.    Discourse Delivered at the Sixty-fourth  Semi-Annual Conference, of the  Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake  City, Sunday Afternoon, October  8th, 1893, by    PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER    I have never attended a conference   since I have been a member of this   Church—now nearly sixty years—at   which I have refused, when called upon   by the proper authority and the Spirit   of God, to speak and to bear my testi-  mony according to the light that I had   in me, and I disliked to pass over this   conference without saying something.   I have been in poor condition for public   speaking, having had a severe cold upon   my lungs during the past week, which   has prevented me from doing almost   any kind of business.    I have been deeply interested in the   testimonies of the servants of God who   have addressed us during this confer-  ence. They have laid before us many   great truths. My mind rests upon the   subject of faith. Faith is the first prin-  ciple of the Gospel. What is faith?   Paul, in writing to the Hebrews, under-  takes to explain it He says that "faith   is the substance of things hoped for, the   evidence of things not seen;" and to   prove this he goes on to tell what dif-  ferent men accomplished through faith.  (See xi chap. of Hebrews). I look upon   faith as one of the most important prin-  ciples that God ever revealed to man.   Here we have four temples in these   mountains, and hundreds of people are   laboring in them. Who for? Both for   the living and the dead. Why do they   labor for the dead? Have they ever   seen the resurrection of the dead? No,   except by vision or revelation. But   they have faith in it, and as an evidence   of that faith they perform this work.   They look forward to the resurrection   and eternal judgment, to the celestial   kingdom and the great blessings which   God has revealed for the salvation and   exaltation of the children of men. They   do this by faith, and it is by this power   that they have accomplished what they   have during the last sixty years. By   faith this tabernacle has been built,   these temples have been reared, and   these people have been gathered from   the nations of the earth.  Thousands of   Elders have been called, not from col-  leges, but from the various occupations   of life, and sent forth into the world to   preach the Gospel without money and   without price. Now for many years   they have gone forth and preached this   Gospel. Men have listened to them,    and some spirit or power has convinced   them that the testimony which these   Elders have borne was true. These   humble men of God have gone forth   and said: &quot;The fullness of the ever-  lasting Gospel has been revealed by the   administration of angels; the Lord has   raised up prophets and inspired men;   He has organized the Church on the   earth as it was in the days of Jesus   Christ and the Apostles; we have   brought you this Gospel; hearken to it,   and we promise you, in the name of the   Lord Jesus Christ, if you will receive   our testimony, repent of your sins, go   down into the water and be baptized   for the remission of your sins, you shall   receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, that   shall bear record and witness unto you   that what we say is true." What has   been the result of this? Thousands have   believed that testimony and proved that   it was true. These Elders labored by   faith; they traveled by faith; they worked   by faith. It was faith that sustained   them all the way through. They trav-  eled without purse and scrip, and through   their faith the God of heaven fed and   clothed them, and opened the way be-  fore them. This has been the case now   for sixty years. And many people be-  lieved the testimony of these simple   men. They repented of their sins, were   baptized for the remission of them, in   the name of the Father, and of the Son,   and of the Holy Ghost; they received   that Holy Ghost, and it bore testimony   to them of the truths of the Gospel.    Brethren and sisters, it is by faith that   you are here today, gathered from the   nations of the earth. By that power you   have been sustained, until you have ac-  complished these things that are now   before you in your history. We ought   to look at these things as they are. We   ought to have faith, not only in what is   past but in what is to come. It is by   faith that we look forward to the resur-  rection of the dead. Our forefathers are   in the spirit world. They died without   the Gospel. They never saw the face of   a prophet or an apostle. They laid   down their bodies, and their spirits went   into the spirit world. There they have l  istened to the Gospel of Christ. Jesus   taught the Gospel in the spirit world   while His body lay in the tomb. Joseph   Smith, Hyrum Smith and those Elders   of Israel who have been martyred and   who have died for the word of God and   testimony of Jesus have gone to preach   this Gospel there. Spirits in prison have   received their testimony. The prison   doors have been opened. These spirits   will come forth in the morning of the   resurrection, and they will receive these   blessings and glories, the same as if they   had heard and received the Gospel in   the flesh. And these Latter-day Saints   have built these temples and gone to    work in them with just as much assur-  ance of the truth of these things as   though it had been sounded in their ears   by the trump of the archangel of God.   They have had this faith, and they will   not be disappointed.    That is the condition the Latter-day   Saints are in today. As to opposition,   we may expect that, because the arch-  enemy has labored against the work of   God in all ages of the world. But we   have reason to rejoice and to be thank-  ful to our Heavenly Father that we are   as well as we are today before Him. I   want the Latter-day Saints to bear in   mind that the ancient patriarchs and   prophets spoke as they were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost, and they spoke   the truth. The Lord has said just what   He meant, and meant what He said.   The word of the Lord will never fall un-  fulfilled. If you want to know what is   coming to pass, read the revelations of   God in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon   and in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants. The revelations of the Lord   through the Prophet Joseph Smith are   glorious revelations. What the Lord   promised in the commencement of this   work has been fulfilled to the very letter   up to the present. So it will continue.   We should lay these things to heart.    There has been a good deal said with   regard to our temporal affairs. That is   all right. What the brethren have said   concerning our temporal condition is of   importance to us. I still am of the   opinion that inasmuch as Zion is going   to be built up on the earth, it is the   mind and will of God that we should do   something for ourselves. We ought to   cultivate the earth. We ought not to   wait for the world to come and   plant and dig our potatoes, or   plant and harvest our wheat, or   to build railroads and carry them on.   The Presidency of the Church have   shouldered a very heavy load connected   with this sugar factory. Why should we   not make sugar? Utah sends a very   great amount every year out of the   Territory for sugar. This should not   be. The soil is here and the talent is   here to raise beets and to make sugar.   Why should not the Latter-day Saints   do this and keep their money at home?   Is there any sin in this? Not at all; the   more of these things we would do, the   better, I think, the Lord would be pleas-  ed with us. I know there has been   quite a feeling one way or another, be-  cause we have burdened ourselves with   these labors. But it is our duty to try   to get the Latter-day Saints to cultivate   the earth and to produce what they eat   and drink and what they wear. We have   tried to do this. It is true, it cost a great   deal to establish the sugar plant, and the   Church had to shoulder a great measure   of responsibility in connection with it, 
 in order to carry it out. I do not think   we have done wrong in that. When I   go before my Father in heaven I am   willing to bear my part of the respon-  sibility, because if there is anything on   earth that I was ever moved upon by the   Spirit to do it was to unite in that enter-  prise with my brethren. I believe it is   our duty to manufacture what we use,   as far as we can, at home. We refer to   these temporal things because they are   and always will be connected with us.    I feel to rejoice myself that we are as   well off as we are. There has never   been a period when we have been any   better off than we are today. I look   back to the days when we came here.   We found a barren desert. The man   that led us here was Brigham Young.   He was a prophet, seer and revelator.   He was never destitute of revelation   from the day that I first knew him until   his body was laid in the tomb. He was   a great man—a man of God. We see   the result of his work here. He was   our architect, so to speak. He fulfilled   his mission in a great and wonderful   manner, and when he laid his body   down he went to mingle with his breth-  ren and the Gods.    The Gospel of Christ is true. The   Zion of God is true. We are here in   fulfilment of the revelations and visions   of the ancient patriarchs and prophets.   Read Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other   prophets, and see what they said. We   came here by the revelations of God.   Many of the brethren felt it hard to   leave our beautiful Nauvoo and to go to   the mountains. Had we not done this,   some of the revelations of God would   have fallen unfulfilled. I say to the   Latter-day Saints, have faith. Let us   have faith in the promises and revela-  tions of God. Do you comprehend   what is manifest in the earth today? The   seeds of destruction are everywhere.   The judgments of God are beginning to   go forth. But who acknowledges the   hand of God in these things? I rejoice   that the cloud of darkness is being lifted   from the eyes of our countrymen in re-  gard to the Latter-day Saints, and that   they are manifesting kindness towards   us. Speaking of our visit East, I con-  fess it was marvelous in my eyes to see   how different these things are today to   what they have been in the past. They   begin to see that the people in the moun-  tains of Israel are white men, and that   they have some talent. I thank God   for these things. I thank Him for the   kindness we have received at the hands   of the friends of our nation. My prayer   to God is that His blessings may rest   upon our nation and upon the leaders   thereof, and that the spirit of liberty, of   law, of righteousness and of truth may   rest upon all American citizens and   everybody that dwells under this great   government. It is one of the greatest   governments God ever raised upon the   earth. What has it been raised up for?   That in the midst of it the Lord might   establish His Zion and His work.    Brethren and sisters, let us be true and   faithful to our duties and to our God.   Let us look forward to the exaltation   and the blessings that God has in store   for those who keep His commandments.   Every man will be judged according to   the deeds done in the body. There are   laws celestial, laws terrestrial, and laws   telestial. We speak of the celestial   glory and of the heavenly hosts. Who   are the heavenly hosts? They are those   who have tabernacled on this earth, been   faithful to God, and passed behind the   veil. And they are interested in the   welfare of the inhabitants of the earth.   They are interested in the salvation of   the human family. They have labored   for it in the flesh; they do so today in   the spirit world. These are the people   we look to by faith. We are here upon   a mission. We are trying to fulfill that   mission. I hope we may be true and   faithful to it.    I am thankful before the Lord for the   blessings that I have enjoyed in this con-  ference and for the testimonies I have   heard from these Apostles. They speak   as men having authority, inspired by the   Spirit of God, and they speak the truth.   Many of our friends that have labored   with us have passed away. We our-  selves shall pass away in our time. I   may say that if it had not been for the  prayers of these thousands of Latter-  day Saints, I today should have been   mingling with my brethren in the spirit   world. I know that I have been preser-  ved by the prayers of my brethren and   sisters, and I am still with you. I feel   very weak, and hardly qualified to mag-  nify my calling as an Apostle, as the   leader of the people of Israel; in fact, no   man is, only as moved upon by the   power of God. What little time I may   stay here I hope my heart will not be set   on the riches of this world, but on doing   the will of God and uniting with my   brethren in bearing off the great work   and responsibility resting upon us. If   we will do this, all will be right. When   we get to the other side of the veil, we   shall know something. We now work   by faith. We have the evidence of   things not seen. The resurrection, the   eternal judgment, the celestial kingdom,   and the great blessings that God has   given in the holy anointings and endow-  ment in the temples, are all for the   future, and they will be fulfilled, for   they are eternal truths. We will never   while in the flesh, with this veil over us,   fully comprehend that which lies before   us in the world to come. It will pay   any man to serve God and to keep His   commandments the few days he lives   upon the earth. With regard to our   position before we came here, I will say  that we dwelt with the Father and with   the Son, as expressed in the hymn, "O   my Father," that has been sung here.   That hymn is a revelation, though it was   given unto us by a woman—Sister Snow.   There are a great many sisters have the   spirit of revelation. There is no reason   why they should not be inspired as well   as men. We dwelt in the presence of   God before we came here, and we have   been sent here upon a mission, and I do   not want to live any longer myself than   I can magnify that calling. What bene-  fit is it to any man to dwell here and to   miss the object for which he was sent,   even eternal life? Therefore, it does   not pay any man to sin. When a man   sins it is because he yields to the enemy,   not because the devil has power over   him irrespective of his agency. The   devil is laboring for the destruction of   the human family. But the Gospel is   sent into the world to save them.    Brethren and sisters, God bless you.   I am glad to meet with you and to have   a little time to speak to you. I hope   and trust we may be true and faithful to t  he end of our days, that we may be   satisfied when we get through with our   work; that our hearts may not be set up-  on anything that perisheth, but that we  may do what we can to build up Zion    and bring forth salvation to mankind as   far as we have the opportunity while we   dwell in the flesh. God bless us and   guide us all i our work, for Jesus'   sake. Amen 
 Various Short Blessings 
 every fool to stay at home and let the steamboats and  captain's alone and let the peace officers alone. How can  we keep off mobs and keep inocent blood from being  shed? By striking a blow at everything which  rises up in disorder and I will wage an eternal  war with those who oppose me while I am labouring  in behalf of the city.    A man has been writing to the   New York Tribune. I will not mention his name.  He says that much has been spent for other  purposes which was appropriated for the building of  the Temple; but I will pledge myself that any  man who has paid any old shoes harness or  anything else if he will come I will show him  on book that everything ^farth[ing]^ has been appropriated for  the building of the Temple.    There are many men in our  midst who are trying to build up themselves at  our expence and others who are watching for iniquity  and who will make a man an offender for a  word. But I will give way and, rest myself for  others".    President Hyrum Smith then made  some costed remarks upon the lawyers.    A brother of Dr Foster threatened the  Mayor and the Mayor fined him ten dollars.    President Joseph Smith's views of the  Government was then read and he was by universal  applause nominated by the Saints as a candidate for   the Presidency of the United States. An article was  read entitled a "Voice of Inocence from Nauvoo" and  a meeting of the "Female Relief Society appointed to  attend to the issue of this article. 
 During the intermission which followed the  Twelve met with the Seventies and they passed a resolution  to build the Hall of the Seventies one story higher for the Presidency.    In the afternoon President Brigham Young addressed  the assembly. In the course of his remarks he said    "I wish to speak of the duty of lawyers classing  myself with the lawyers in the House of Israel. When any man  who is a lawyer takes a course to break peace instead of making   it he is out of the way of his duty. A doctor of the law  should study the law and make peace.    The grand object we have before us is to build  the Temple this season. We have had the effects of  slander and want a cure and balm. I carry one  with me all the while and I want you to do the same  I will tell you what it is. It is to mind our own  business and let others alone and suffer wrong rather  than do wrong. If any one will take your property  away let him alone and have nothing to do with  him.    A spirit has been manifested to   divide the Saints. This was manifest in the last  election. It was said if they did not look out  the Saints on the flat would beat the Saints on  the hill. Great God! How such a thing  looks that the Saints should be affraid of beating  one another in the election or being beat?    I would ask who built up this  city? Would steamboats have landed here if   the Saints had not come or could speculators  have sold their lands for anything here? If the  Saints had not come they might have sold for a  few bear and wolf skins but not for money. Can  these speculators sell all their lands to the Saints 
 for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhere  else. I tell you nay for know it ye people that Israel  is here and that they are the head and not the tail and the  people must learn it. All those who have gone from us  have gone from the head to the tail. But if any of you  wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up  then butter it both sides and it will fall so. Uppose  this work and it will roll over you. When did this  work ever stop since it began? Never. The only  thing the Saints now want to know is what does   the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Well  then build the Temple of the Lord; keep the law of  God ye Saints and the hypocrit and scoundral will   flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of God  will be ^too^ hot for them".    Joseph the Prophet & the Presidential Chair    Elder John Taylor followed Brigham Young in an address  upon government and political matters and Joseph in an  address after said    "As to politics I care but little about  the Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much for  the office as I would for the one I now hold; but as the  world have used the power of government to oppress and  persecute us it is right for us to use it for the protection  of our rights. When I get hold of the eastern papers  ^and^ I see how popular I am, I am affraid myself that I shall  be elected; but if I should be ^ellected^ I would not say your  cause is just but I cannot do anything for you 
 What I said in relation to the  Anexation of Texas    is with some unpopular. The people are opposed to it.  I will take this objection away. The opposition is because   it is filled up with slavery. Now I wish to turn the  argument. It is the very reason why they ought to be  received in order to watch over them. Of the two evils  we should reject the greatest. The President of Texas  says if you do not receive us in the United States we  will go to the British. This would certainly be bad  policy for this nation. The British are now throughout  the whole country trying to bribe all they can. How  much better it is to be to a little expence than to have  the Indians and British upon us. We should grasp  all the Territory we can. I know much which I  do not tell. I have had bribes offered to me but I   have rejected them. The government will not receive  anything from me. They are self-sufficient; but they  must go to Hell and work out their own salvation  with fear and trembling. As soon as Texas  ^was^ is anexed I would liberate two are three States  and Gipay them for their slaves and let them go  to Mexico where they are mixed blacks &c. I would  also receive Canadia and stand by it."    Next day March the 8th I met in  council with the Twelve and First Presidency when the  subject of nominating a candidate for the vice Presidency   of the U.S. came up. They had nominated  General Arlington Bennet not knowing that he was  a native of Ireland. The final decision was for  me to write to Col. Solomon Copeland ^of Tennessee^ to invite him  to visit us and see if he would suffer his name 
 to run for the Vice Presidency and I wrote to him accordingly.    On the seventh ^tenth^ day of this month Bro  King Follet was buried under Masonic honours. He  was killed while in a well by having a bucket of stone  fall on him.    A large Assembly of the Saints [m]et at  the Temple and was addressed by Joseph upon    The Work Calling & Spirit of Elias Elijah & Messiah    There is a difference between the spirit and  office of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I   wish first to speak off. And in order to come to   the subject I will bring some of the testimony from  the Scripture and give also my own.    In the first place suffice it to say  that I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayer  His will concerning me and I saw an angel and he  laid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be a  Priest after the order of Aaron and to hold the keys of this  Priesthood which office was to preach repentance and baptism  for the remission of sins and also to baptize. But  I was informed that this office did not extend to the  laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and that  that office was a greater work and was to be given afterward  but that my ordination at that time was a preparatory  work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for   the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way  for the greater. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-70##]    This was the case with John the Baptist.  He came crying from the wilderness "Prepare ye the the  way of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people 
 were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of Elias.  John was very particular to tell the people he was not that light  but was sent to bear witness thereof. [##John 1:7-8##] He told them that his  mission was to preach repentance and baptism with water  but that it was he who should come after him who should  baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been   an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds   and undertook to have performed ordinances which did not  belong to the office and calling under the spirit of Elias.    The spirit of Elias is to prepare the   way for a greater revelation of God. This is the Priesthood   of Elias or the Priesthood unto which Aaron was ordained.  And when God sends a man into the world to Prepare  for a greater work he holds the Keys of the power of  Elias. It was called the doctrine of Elias even  from the early ages of the world.    John's mission was limited to preaching  and baptizing but what he did was legal and when  Jesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptized  them with fire and the Holy Ghost.    We find the Apostles endowed  with greater power than John. Their office was more  under the Spirit and power of Elijah than of Elias.  In the case of Philip when he went down to Samaria  under the Spirit of Elias he baptized both men and   women but when Peter and John heard of it they went  down and laid their hands on them and they received  the Holy Ghost. [##Acts 8:5-17##] This shows the distinction between  the two powers. When Paul came to certain disciples  he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. They  answered, "No." "Who baptized you then?"  "We were baptized unto John's baptism." "No John  did not baptize your for he did his work right." [##Acts 19:1-5##] 
 So Paul baptized them over again for he knew what the true  doctrine was and he knew that John had not baptized them  and it is strange to me that men who have read the Scrip[tures]  of the New Testament are so far from these principles.    What I want to impress upon your  mind is the difference of power in different parts of the  Priesthood so that when any man comes among you saying  I have the Spirit of Elias you may know whether he be  true or false for any man coming having the spirit   and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. [##Luke 1:17##] John  did not transcend his bounds but faithfully performed  that part belonging to his office. And every portion of  the great building should be prepared rightly and assigned   to its proper place.    It is necessary to know who holds  the Keys of power and who do not or we may be likely  to be deceived. That person who holds the keys of   Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend   much more time in conversing about the spirit of  Elias I shall not have time to do justice to the spirit  and power of Elijah who is the Elias spoken of in the  last days. And here is the rock upon which many  split thinking the time was past in the days of  Jesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of   Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefor[e]  I speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrine  is true.    Now for Elijah. The spirit power   and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold   the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowm[ents]  of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and of  the Kingdom of God on the earth and to receive and  perform all the ordinances of the Kingdom of God 
 even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and  the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are   in heaven.    Malachi says, "I will send Elijah  before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and He  shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the hearts  of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earth  with a curse. [##Malachi 4:5-6##]    Now what I am after is the knowledge  of God and I take my own course to obtain it. What  are we to understand by this ^the mission of Elijah^ in the last days. In the  days of Noah God destroyed the world by a flood and  he has promised to destroy it by fire in the last  days. But before it takes place Elijah shall first   come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &c  Now comes the point. What is the office and work   of Elijah? and this is one of the most important subjects  that God has revealed.    He shall send Elijah to seal the  fathers to the children and the children to the fathers!  Now was this merely confined to the living to settle  difficulties with families on earth? By no means.  It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would   you do were you here? Would you confine your   work to the living alone. No. I would refer you  to the Scripture where the subject is manifest.  "Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without   them." [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:15##] the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.    I wish you to understand this subject   for it is important and if you will receive it this is the  spirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connect  ourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and seal  up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection 
 And here we want the power of Elijah to seal those who  dwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This is  the power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of Jehovah.    Let us suppose a case. Suppose the  great God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himself  to Father Cutler here and tell him I offer up a decree  that whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will I  seal in heaven. You have power then? Can it be  taken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by   the power ^keys^ of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this is  the power of Elijah and herein is the difference between  the ^spirit and^ power of Elias and Elijah for while the spirit of  Elias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficient  to make our calling and election sure; and it is  the same doctrine where we are exhorted to go on  unto perfection not laying again the foundation of   repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands  the resurrection of the dead &c. [##Matthew 18:18##] We cannot be perfect  without the Fathers &c. We must have revelation  then and we can see that the doctrine of revelation as  far transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all as  knowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalled  from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existance    This spirit of Elijah was manifest  in the days of the Apostles in delivering certain ones  over to the buffettings of Satan that they may be  saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were  sealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of   hell until the day of the Lord or revelation of  Jesus Christ.    Here is the doctrine of election that  the world have quarrelled so much about but they  do not know anything concerning it. The doctrine 
 that the Preysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much about  namely once in grace always in grace and on the other side the  falling away from grace I will say a word about. They are  both wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeterian  says once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist says  you can have grace to day fall from it to-morrow next  day have grace again and so follow it on. But the   doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of Elijah would  show them both false and take the road between.  According to the Scriptures if a man has received the good  word of God and tasted of the powers of the world to come  if he shall fall away it is impossible to renew him  again seeing that he has crucified the Son of God  afresh and put him to an open shame    So there is a possibility of falling  ^away^ yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannot  seal against this sin for this is a reserve made in the  seals and power of the Priesthood.    I will make every doctrine plain  that I present and it shall stand upon a firm basis  and I am at the defiance of the world for I will take  shelter under the broad cover of the wings of the work  in which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all   hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the crackling of  the thorns under the pot    A murderer for instance—one  who has shed inocent blood cannot have forgiveness  David sought repentance at the hand of God carefully  with tears; but he could only get it through hell. He  obtained a promise that his soul should not be left in   hell. [##Acts 2:25-31##] Although David was king he never did obtain   the Spirit and Power of Elijah and the fulness of  the Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and 
 and the throne and kingdom of David are to be taken from  him and given to another by the name of David in  the last days raised up out of his lineage.    Peter refered to the same subject  on the day of Penticost but the multitude did not get  the endowment which Peter had; but several days after  the people asked "what shall we do?" Speaking of their  crucifying the Lord Peter said "I wot that through ignorance  ye did it as did also your rulers" He did not say to  them repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins  but he said "Repent ye therefore and be converted that your  sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing  shall come from the presence of the Lord." [##Acts 2:37-38##] This is the  case with murderers. They could not be baptized for   the remission of sins for they had shed inocent blood    Again to the doctrine of the sealing  power of Elijah. is that If you have power to seal on earth  and in heaven then you should be wise. The first thing  you do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters unto  yourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal glory  and go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftiness  and seal all you can and when you get to heaven tell  your father ^that^ what you sealed on earth should be sealed in  heaven. I will walk through the gate of heaven and  claim what I seal and those that follow me and my  counsel.    The Lord once told me that what I asked  for I should have. I have been afraid to ask God to  kill my enemies lest some of them should peradventure  repent. I asked a short time since for the Lord to  deliver me out of the hands of the Governor of Missouri  and if needs be to accomplish it to take him away  and the next news which came pouring down from 
 there was that Governor Reynolds had shot himself    I would now say Beware O Earth how you  fight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the days  of Elijah when his enemies came upon him fire ^was^ called down from  heaven and destroyed them [##1 Kings 1:10-12##]    The Spirit of Elias is first Elijah second  and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way  and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding the  keys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placing  the seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house of  Israel and making all things ready. Then Messiah  comes to his Temple which is last of all    Messiah is above the spirit and power   of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritual  rock unto Moses in the wilderness. Elijah was to come  and prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the   coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit of  Elias was to begin it.    I have asked the Lord concerning his  coming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign and  said "In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens as  a sign and token. In any year that the bow shall be  seen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead time  and harvest during that year. But whenever you see the  bow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall be  famine pestelence and great distress among the nations [##Genesis 9:13-16##]    But I will take the responsibility upon   myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christ  will not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seen  the bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord that  Christ will not come in forty years and if ever the Lord   spake by my mouth he will not come in that time  Jesus never did reveal to any man the precise time 
 that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and you  cannot find any part which specifies the exact time of his  coming and all who say so are false teachers. There are   some important things concerning the office of the Messiah  in the organization of the kingdom of God ^world^ of which I   will speak hereafter."    [FIGURE]    The Sunday fortnight ^two weeks^ when I arrived at  the Temple Joseph was speaking. He said    "I have been informed by two gentlemen  that a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purpose  of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his family  and all the Smith family and also the heads of the  Church. One of the gentlemen will give his name  to the public and the other wishes it to be hid for  the present. They will both testify to it on oath  and make an affadavit upon it. The names of the   persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are Chaucy  Higby Dr Foster Mr Jackson and William and Wilson Law  And the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundation  is—he says that I had mens heads cut off in Missouri  and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the  people whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.    I wont sware out a warrant against  them for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare   off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity  that I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready to  bear it. There is honour among enemies. I am  willing to do anything for the good of the people. I  will give the name of one of the gentlemen who have  devulged the plot. His name is Eaton. He will  sware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said 
 a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhow  As concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about it  now but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tell  all I know about them"    Orson Spencer and Sidney Rigdon followed with  addresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose and  remarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He said    In relation to the power of ^over^ the minds  of mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequence  of the power ^of truth^ in the doctrines which I have been an instru-  ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them and  not because of any compusion on my part. I will ask  if I ever got any of it unfair?—if I have not reproved you   in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion over  any man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelieving  any doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do not  my enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? They  cannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voice  of one crying in the wilderness. "Repent of your sins  and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man  for the Kingdom of God has come unto you and   hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the tree  and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit God  Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down   and cast into the fire"    Twelve days later I attended the  dedication of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge. This was  the first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The   procession was composed of about five hundred members  and the whole was grand and imposing    In the fore part of the day President  Joseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon 
 of King Follet one of the Masonic Brotherhood but in consequence  of ill health he omitted it and called upon Elder Amasa Lyman  to address the multitude who had assembled on purpose to   hear the funeral discourse from Joseph.    The day following this was the anniversary  of the Church which opened our anual General Conference    General Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Christ of L. S. D [L. D. S.]  held at Nauvoo  April 6th A.D. 1844.    Conference commenced at 10 am. President Brigham   Young called the Conference to order. The Prophet  then said that he should not occupy time in speaking  of any differences which might have occurred in our  midst. He said he was not a Fallen Prophet  and never sustained a nearer relationship to God than  at the present time and would show before the  conference closed that God was with him    Sidney Rigdon afterwards spoke  and during the Conference of the several days he  delivered three important discourses of which I reported a  synopsis in my journal and which will be found embodied  in the History of Joseph Smith    On the 3rd Sunday of the ^2nd day of con^   Sunday the 7th in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph   delivered one of the most important discourses of his  life to about ten ^twenty^ thousand souls upon the subject   of the death of King Follet. 
 of the Almighty.    Go then to the beginning that you may  understand. I ask this congregation what kind of a  being is God? Turn your thoughts in your own  hearts and say have any of you seen or heard Him  or communed with Him. This is a question which  may occupy your attention. The scriptures informs us  that this is eternal life to know thee the only true and  living God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. If  any enquire What kind of a being God is I would say  if you do not know Him you have not eternal life  Go back and find out what kind of a being God is.  If I am the man that shows you what kind of being   God is then let every man and woman sit in silence  and never lift up the hand against me again. If I  do not this I will make no more pretentions to  inspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like the  rest of the world a false teacher and you would want  to take my life. But you might just as well  take the lives of other false teachers as mine if I  was false. But meddle not with any man for his  religion. Every Government ought to protect ^permit^ every man  to enjoy his religion    I will show the world is wrong by  showing what God is. I am going to enquire  after Him so that you may know God that persecution  may cease concerning me. I will go back to the  beginning to show what kind of a being God was. I  will tell you and hear it O Earth! God who sits in  Yonder heavens is a man like unto yourselves.  That God if you were to see Him to day who holds  the worlds you would see Him like a man in form  like yourselves. Adam was made in His 
 image and talked and walked with Him    In order to understand the dead for the  consolation of those who mourn I want you to understand God and  how he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God   from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take away  the veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principles  to know that we may converse with Him. He was once a  man like unto us and the Father was once on an earth  like us, and I wish I was in a suitabll place to tell it    The scriptures inform us, mark it, that  Jesus Christ said "As the Father hath power in Himself so  hath the Son power in Himself." STo do what? That Father did even  to lay down my ^his^ body and take it up again. Do you believe  it? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell and  earth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to become  yourself ^a^ God king and priest by going from a small capacity  to a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and to  dwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn the  first principle of this order    How consoling to the mourners when  they part with their friends to know that though they lay down  this body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burning  to be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ  enjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive at  the station of a God    What did Jesus Christ do? "The  same as I see the Father do." See the Father do what?  "Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I will  give it up to the Father which will add to His glory  He will then take a higher exaltation and I shall   take His place and be also exalted"    These are the first principles of   the Gospel. It will take a long time after the 
 grave to understand the whole    If I should say anything but what was in  the Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will then  go to the Bible and will make a comment on the very  first sentence of the history of the Creation—Berosheit. I want  to analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everything  else. Rosh, the head; sheit, gramatical termination  When the inspired man wrote it he did not put the baith  there; an old Jew without any authority added the word: he  thought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat at   first "The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods": that is  the true meaning of the words. Baurau signifies to  bring forth. If you do not believe it you do not   believe the learned man of God. Learned men can  teach you no more than what I have told you. Thus   the head God brought forth the Gods in the Grand Council  I will transpose it in the English language. I want you to  know and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.  The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated the  Creation of the world. Some will say the scriptures  ^say^ so and so; but I will show you a test out of an old  edition of the New Testament in the Hebrew Latin  German and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of the  fourth ch. of Mathew our common translation says  James the Son of Zebedee but this old book in my  possession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of the  four languages—the Hebrew Latin German and Greek  The doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if you  preach anything not according to the Bible we will cry  treason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye   escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimony  of four against one—the present translation. I have the oldest  book in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank God  for the old book but more for the Holy Ghost. 
 In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council of  the Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and people  it. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we knew   how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.    Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they account it   blasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made the  world out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in the  things of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost does  anyhow and he is within me and comprehends more than all the world and I will  associate myself with him. They infer from the word create that the world must  have been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word Baurau  and does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would organize  materials to build a ship. Element had an existance from the time God had It can be organized  and reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt man  It is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead—namely, the soul  the mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it come  from? The learned say God made it in the beginning  But it is not so. I know better. God has told me  If you do not believe it that will not make the truth  without effect. God was a self-existing being Man  exists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacle  and put the spirit into it and man became a human  soul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equal  with God Himself.    You who mourn the loss of friends  are only seperated from them but for a moment.  The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are   conversant with each other as we are on earth. I am  dwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of man  It is logic to say the Spirit of man had a beginning  and yet has no end? It does not have either a  beginning or end. My ring is like the existance  of the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. If  it were cut in two there would be both a beginning  and an end. So with man. If he had a beginning   he would also have an end.    If I am right I might say God never  had power to create the Spirit of man. God Himself  could not create himself. Intelligence is eternal 
 and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvement  The relationship we sustain with God places us in a situation  to advance in knowledge. God has power to institute laws  to instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exalted  with Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes good  I can taste the principles of eternal life. So can you  They are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ  and I know you believe it. All that which God  sees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known his  will to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies  at all and those revelations which will save our spirits will  also save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which rests  upon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have not  obeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or be  damned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in which  to tell you all; I would let you know that I am not  'a fallen Prophet.'    The greatest responsibility laid upon us in this  life is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says they  without us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary that  the sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our children  and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times—  a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ  before the foundation of the world for the Salvation of man  It is necessary that those who are gone before and those who are come  after us should have Salvation in common with us and thus  has God made it obligatory upon man. Hence he has said  I will send Elijah the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. [##Malachi 4:5-6##]    From before the foundation of the world God hath  made provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, "All  sins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost should  be forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in this  world or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable 
 sin. [##Matthew 12:31##] God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be  saved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friends  can be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternity  can save him if he has not committed the unpardonable sin.    A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the  dissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If a  man has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guilty  of great sins he is punished for them. When he consents to  obey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.    A man's own mind damns him. I  have no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The torment  of disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burning  with fire and brimstone. I    No man can commit the unpardonable  sin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must be  done in this world and cannot be committed after the  dissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus   Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devil  for even he stood up as a Saviour. All who ^must^ suffer until  they obey Christ himself.    The contention in heaven was Jesus said  there would be souls who would not be saved and the Devil  said he could save them all and laid his plans before the  grand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus Christ  So the devil rose up in rebellion against God and was cast  down with all who put up their hands for him.    Jesus Christ will save all except the Sons   of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the unpar-  unpardonable sin. He must receive the Holy Ghost have  the heavens opened to him and know God and then sin  against Him. After a man has sinned against the  Holy Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got to  say the Sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to 
 to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him and  to deny the plan of Salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from   that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostates  of the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for my  blood; they have the Spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord of  Life—the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannot  save them. They make open war like the Devil.    If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say   that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Be  cautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the same  is of the devil.    I could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning the  relationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into the  eternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my Fathers  Kingdom and Paul says there is one glory of the sun another of the moon  another of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory  So also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us in  relation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We   have seen them walk worthily in our midst and sink ^fall^ asleep in  the arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are now  in the celestial Kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrection  of the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who will  have to wait myri[a]ds of years before they can receive the like  blessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the   Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait for  your friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.  Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph glorious  in the celestial world while their murderers shall dwell in torment for  ages until they have paid the uttermost farthing.    I have a father brothers children and friends who ^have^ gone to a   world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meet  again. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When we  depart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love who  have fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &c. It will be an  eternity of felicity.    A question may be asked will mothers have their  children in eternity. Yes Yes mothers. You shall have your children 
 for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaiting  them. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead and  be forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the child  in the same precise form as it appeared before it died out of its mothers  arms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions of  glory and exercise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternity  is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones of  glory with not one cubit added to their stature.    I will leave this subject here and make a few remarks  upon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism of  fire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. An  individual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the Kingdom  of God. In German the text bears me out the same as the revelations which  I have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. You  will find it in the declaration of [Baptist, John the (NT)|[John the Baptist.  -[reads from the German]-  John says "I baptize you with water, but when Jesus comes who has the  power (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost."    There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling one  baptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptism  not being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay the  foundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at the  defiance of the world to contradict me if they can.    Hear it all ye ends of the earth—all ye Priests—all ye sinners  and all men—Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for your  religion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.  There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hell  but I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven  in this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those   who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to Gnolom, to dwell in  hell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world so  they shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstone  Some shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlasting  burnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness  which is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone.    I have no enmity against any man. I love you all but  I hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons miss  their mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates me  he is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sisters.    I rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my aged  friends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. No  man knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall never  undertake it. I dont blame any one for not believing my   history. If I had not experienced what I have I could not  have believed it myself. I never did harm any man since  I was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.    I cannot lie down until all my work is finished.  I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellow  man. When I am called by the trumph of the archangel  and weighed in the balance you will all know me then.    I add no more God bless you all. Amen. 
 Conference reassembled the next day April the 8th  when Joseph arose and said it was impossible for him to  continue the subject of the previous day in consequence of the  weakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks was  one of the most important revelations of the age. He said    Yet I have    A Great Proclamation    It is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for the  Elders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of   South & North America is Zion and the mountain of the  Lord's house is in the centre of North and South America  When the House is done the baptismal font erected  and finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &  ^ordained^ kings and priests which must be done in this life—  and when the place is prepared you must also go through  all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and if  you have any dead relations for them also the same  as for yourselves—then the Elders are to go through all  America and build up Churches until all Zion is built  up.    But this is not to commence until this Temple   is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forth  and accomplish the work and build up stakes in  all North and South America. There will be some  place ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I think  this will be the one."    He also remarked that this proclamation  was the greatest ever made to us as all could not  come here but it was necessary that enough should  come to build up the Temple and get an endowment so  that the work could spread abroad.    Joseph's lungs failed him and he called  upon George J. Adams to occupy the forenoon. 
 At the close of the morning's meeting President Joseph  Smith turned over the Conference into the hands of the Twelve  and it continued through the next day under the presidency  of Brigham Young and then adjourned to the following  Saturday to re-assemble at 2 o clock to hear a political  address from Elder John Taylor.    During this Conference ^244^  Elders volunteered ^were called^ to go into the vineyard that season to preach   the gospel.    On the 4th of May I moved into my  new brick house and felt truly thankful to have a  comfortable dwelling for the first time to leave my  family in while I went out again on mission.    Next day I spent with my family  preparing for my Summer's mission and I called  my family together and blessed them and Phebe washed  my feet that I might be clean every whit.    A number of Apostates on the same   day which was Sunday the 5th met together and organized  a new Church and took a strong stand against  the Prophet the Twelve and the Church. The leaders  were Wm. and Wilson Law R.D. Foster Chauncy  and Francis Highby James Blakesley and others.    Five days later which was ^[unclear]^  May  the 9th I arose in the morning arranged some domestic  affairs and parted from my wife and children for the  purpose of taking my summer's mission through the  United States to attend the General Conferences  For the last ten years of my life with the exception of  one it had been my lot to be in the vineyard every  Summer. I left Nauvoo in company with  Elders George A Smith J. M. Grant and Ezra Thayer 
 and his son.    This was the last mission ever Joseph  the Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensation  He wished none of us to remain with the exception of Willard  Richards. He told John Taylor he wanted hism to  go especially on this mission with his quorum and he  spoke with much earnestness. He also turned to me  and said brother Woodruff I want you to go and if  you do not you will die. It rested with weight upon   my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thought  since when musing over the awful catastrophy of his & Hyrums  martyrdom how true his words might have been had I  remained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and Willard  Richards the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo where  with him in prison at his assassination. Had more  of us been there with him in Nauvoo we might some  of us have met the death which Elder John Taylor  but barely escaped. having received    It might have been that Willard Richards who was the  only one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of the  Twelve was also the only one of us who could stay with  him unhurt ^safely^ and he passed through that awful scene   of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safe  from personal harm.    I took the parting hand of Joseph  and Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph was  standing in his own entery when I took his hand to  bid him farewell. Brother J. M. Grant was with  me. As he took me by the hand he said  "Brother Woodruff, you are now about to start upon  your mission." I answered "Yes." He looked  me steadily in the eye for a time without speaking  He looked as though he would penetrate my very 
 soul but at the same time seemed unspeakably sorrowful as  though he was weighed down with a foreboding of something  dreadful in the future. He finally spoke in a mournful  voice—"God bless you Brother Woodruff! Go in peasce!"  I turned and left him with a sorrowful heart partaking  of the same spirit that rested upon him. This was the   last time I ever saw his face or heard his voice again [x].    During the following week we journeyed  on our mission held meetings and on the 18th in Newark  Kendall Co George A Smith and myself of the Twelve  held our first Conference at which were present various other   officers of the Church. At the close of the Conference  Elders Charles C. Rich David Fulmer and Henry Jacobs  arrived from Nauvoo    Next evening we all met at the school  House to deliver a political lecture. I called the meeting  to order and introduced to the assembly Mr Henry Jacobs  who arose and read General J Smiths views of the policy  and powers of the United States Government after  which I introduced ^Mr^ David Fulmer who addressed the  assembly in an effective manner showing the policy  of Joseph and then I urged our claims and right to vote  for our own president and George A Smith closed with  a spirited political address. The next evening we  also held another meeting for the same object and had   quite a time in political spirit ^matter^ and the impression   made on the people was good. We had rode on this  day thirty miles to hold our meeting in a large School  room in Juliett    We continued from place to place  holding meetings reading the views of General Joseph   Smith to public assemblies making political speeches  and placing Joseph before the public as a fitting 
 candidate for the Presidency of the United States    On the 1st of June we held the Kalamazoo  Conference in Comstock Kalamazoo Co. Michigan. There  were present 2 of the quorum of the Twelve—Wilford  Woodruff and George A Smith; 3 High Priests ^Council^—S. Bent  Charles C. Rich and D. Fulmer; 5 of the High Priest  quorum—H Green, Z Coltrin Moses Smith, E Thayer  and G. Coltrin and also 8 of the Seventies, 14 Elders  2 Priests and 1 Deacon.    The Conference was called to order by  Elder Charles C. Rich when Elder Wilford Woodruff  was chosen to the chair and Elders C. Dunn and  E M Webb as clerks of the Conference.    The various Branches were represented  & President C. C. Rich in Council with the Officers after  the close of the Conference appointed the Elders to their  stations in the different Counties of the State and   he manifested much wisdom in arranging his plans in   carrying out his work both on politics and religion in the  State of Michigan that Season.    On the 8th we held the Pleasant Valley  Conferance and on the 15th another Conference was held  by us in Franklin Oaklin Co.    On the 26 alone I arrived at  Boston and next day had an interview with Elder Brigham  Young. We spent the forepart of the day together    Early in the evening he took cars for  Salem. This was on    The Day of the Martyrdom    Elder Brigham Young and myself were setting together in  the railway Station at the time that Joseph and his brother 
 Hyrum were assassinated. This was June the 27th at a quarter past   five at Carthage the place of the fiendish tragedy and half past six p.m.  at Boston where Elder Young and myself were. Brigham as we  sat together in the Station was very sorrowful and depressed in spirit  without knowing the cause. This was the time that the direst blow  which Satan had struck since the Son of God was crucified sent the  spirits of the Prophet and Patriarch to join the martyred host of God's servants  Too well we afterwards knew why all the Twelve wherever they were  on that day and at that time were like the President of our quorum  very sorrowful and burdened in spirit without knowing why.    Two days afterwards we held the    Boston Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Latter-Day Saints  at Franklin Hall  June 29, 1844.    There was present a majority of the quorum of the   Twelve—namely, Brigham Young its President Heber  C. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson Pratt William Smith  Lyman Wight and Wilford Woodruff; and also a  large number of Elders. Brigham Young  presided.    The Conference continued for two days  and was addressed by Orson Hyde Brigham Young  H. C. Kimball Lyman Wight Orson Pratt and  Wilford Woodruff.    The Conference was well attended  the meeting spirity and the discourses instructive  and effectual. 
 State Convention of Jeffersonian Democracy.    Ticket: General Joseph Smith for the Presidential Chair  Sidney Rigdon Vice President    The Convention met at 10 o clock a.m. July 1st  in the Melodian [Melodeon] at Boston, and was organized as  follows    The Hon Brigham Young of Nauvoo President  The Hons William Smith and Gen. Lyman Wight  vice Presidents  The Hon Wilford Woodruff and Professor O Pratt  of Illinois A McAllister Esq of Boston  and N H Felt Esq of Salem Secretaries.    The Convention was addressed with much  animation and patriotism during the day and evening   by the President Hons Orson Hyde Daniel Spencer William  Smith and Professor Pratt all of Illinois and George B  Wallace of Boston.    A Preamble and many important  Resolutions were adopted all of which together with the   proceedings of the meeting were published in the Boston  Times of July 2nd 1844.    The Melodian was crowded in  the evening and it was soon evident that a large number  of rowdies were in the galleries and disposed to make  disturbance. Among others Abby Folsom made her   appearance and arose and commenced speaking while  the President of the Convention was addressing the 
 meeting. A young man soon afterwards arose and began rowdy conduct  in which he was encouraged by his companions until confusion became  general in the gallery. The police came in to take the  young man out but they were badly beaten by a set of   young desperadoes. After much hard fighting however the  officers succeeded in clearing the gallery of the rowdies but the  meeting was also soon broken up.    The Convention was adjourned until the next  day at 4 o'clock at Bunker Hill. Heber C. Kimball  and George B Walace were appointed delegates to the Baltimore  national Convention.    We met at 8 o clock a.m. on the 2nd of  July held a council and devided ourselves off into different  parts of the Vineyard and each one took several Conferences  to attend to.    The same night I left the city in  company with Milton Holmes and old companion  and fellow labourer in the ministry whom I had not   met for five years. We left Boston at 7 o clock p.m.    Next day we arrived at Father  Carter's early in the afternoon and found my wifes   father and mother and her brother Fabyan and family  all well.    I descovered on my arrival that brother  S. B. Stoddard and had given out an appointment  for our Conference which was held in Scarboro on  the 6th and 7th in a Presbyterian Meeting House.    There were present of the Elders  Wilford Woodruff S. B. Stoddard Milton Holmes  Elbridge Tufts and Samuel Parker. On the  Sunday afternoon we had an audience of about six  hundred. 
 In company of Father Carter and Milton Holmes  I left Scarboro on the 9th and rode to Portland and dined  with my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and was about to take  steam boat in the evening for Thomastown and Fox Islands  but in the afternoon we obtained the Boston Times  containing the solemn information of the assassination of the  Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum.    Next day I took the cars for Boston  and on the following met with the Saints. They mourned  the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meeting  they were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of the  Spirit was with us so that we had a good time together.    On the morrow I wrote a letter  to the Editor of the Prophet published in New York  by the friends of our martyred leader giving a word  of exhortation to the Saints abroad to maintain their  integrity and keep the faith and paitence of the  saints unto death.    The following morning we obtained  information from Quincy as late as June 29th giving  full accounts of the horrid affair at Carthage and the  tremendious loss which the Church had sustained.  The Governor himself acknowledged the death of Joseph  and Hyrum to be a wanton murder. The State of  Illinois was in commotion and Governor Ford had  made Quincy his head quarters and issued a Proclamation  to the citizens of the State. The news of the day  stated that the Mormon Leaders in Nauvoo had done  all they could to restrain the disciples of the martyred  Prophet from vengeance still there was evidently a  disposition of both the people and the troops to destroy  Nauvoo lest the Mormons should hold a fearful  reckoning in the State in their desperation and despair 
 at the loss and assassination of the Prophet and Patriarch of the Church  The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth.    I again held meeting with the Boston Saints  on Sunday the 14th preached to them in the forenoon ^from Rev Ch VI verse 9, 10, 11, & 12;^ administered   the sacrament in the afternoon and preached again in the evening  I was the only one of the Twelve at that time in Boston.    We had not heard from any of our brethren  of the calamity which had fallen upon us in the great breerevement  of the Church but as I arose on the morning of the 16th two  letters were handed to me one from Erastus Snow and the other  from John E. Page confirming the martyrdom of the Prophet   and Patriarch.    I immediately wrote three letters to Brigham   Young and sent one to Peterboro N. H. one to Lowell  and one to Bradford Mass. I then went direct to the  Post Office and took out a letter directed to G. A. Smith from  his wife in which Mrs Woodruff wrote a few lines to me  which was the first intelligence I had from her since I left   home. She related to me a dream which Joseph had  a few days before he sealed his testimony with his blood.    He thought that William and Wilson  Law bound him and cast him into a pit or well  like as Joseph was anciently. He struggled hard  and got up so that he could look out and he saw  the Laws a little distance off one of them in the  grasp of a tigar and the other in that of a snake  They called to him to come and help them but he told them  they had bound him and he could not; and he thought  in his dream that a brother soon came along and took  him out of the pit.    On the following day July 17th  Elder Brigham Young arrived in Boston. I walked   with him to 57 Temple Street and called upon 
 Sister Vose. Brother Young took the bed and I the arm  chair and here we veiled our faces and gave vent to our  grief. Until now I had not shed a tear since I heard  of the death of the Prophet but my soul had felt nerved  up like steael. After giving vent to our grief in tears  we felt more composed. Brother Brigham left the  city again on the same day.    On the following day Elders Orson Hyde  Heber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt arrived in the city  and President Brigham Young also returned and we met  together and held a council. I wrote a letter to the   Prophet advising the Elders who had families in  Nauvoo to go immediately to them and for all the  authorities of the Church to forthwith assemble at  Nauvoo for a Council: "By order of the Quorum of  the Twelve. Wilford Woodruff clerk; Brigham   Young President. -[Published in Deseret News Vol VII. No 44]-    That night there was a meeting in a   hall in Washington Street opposite Boydston Hall.  Elder Orson Hyde had advertized to preach on the murder  of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the close of which a  collection was to be taken up to pay his expences  home.    I reported a synopsis of his address and  recorded it in my Journal.    At the close of Elder Hyde's discourse  President Brigham Young arose and said he felt disposed  to add his testimony.    "Be of good cheer. The testimony is  not in force while the Testator liveth: when he died  it was in force: so it is with Joseph. On the day  of Pentecost there were but one hundred and twenty of  the Saints but at that time there was added three  thousand Souls. When God sends a man to do a 
 work all the devils in hell cannot kill him until he gets through  his work: So with Joseph. He prepared all things gave the keys  to men on the earth and said I may soon be taken from you."    I left Boston on the 20th and arrived at my  father's house in Farmington two days later. I found my father  and stepmother alone, not a child with them in their decline of  life to watch over them    I had but twenty four hours to stay  and I happily improved the time. My father was 67 years  of age and I might never have seen him again in mortality  and my mind had been deeply impressed of late that I  had something to do for my parents.    As the sable shades of a serene night  drew her curtain over the earth and stilled the cares of day  we met alone: none but congenial spirits were there. I  arose and with the Spirit like that of Joseph towards his  father Jacob opened my heart to my father and he reciprocated  my sentiments. [##Genesis 46:29##] I then laid my hands upon his head and  according to the authority of the Priesthood and Apostleship  (confered upon me under the hands of the Twelve Apostles  upon the corner stone of the house of the Lord in Far West  President Brigham Young being mouth) I ordained my  father Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an High  priest and Patriarch after the order of Melchezedic and   I placed upon his head the seals of the covenant in connection  with Bulah Thompson and Azubah Hart—my own   mother and stepmother and sealed him up unto eternal  life. I shall never forget the deep satisfaction and   heavenly spirit of that night beneath my father's roof  Sleep departed from me and I was wrapt in the  meditations and visions of by gone days and the days  to come and of this life and the one hereafter. 
 The next day I again left my father's house  and arrived in New York on the next  ^following^ morning. I then  took steamboat and found on board Elders Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt  We were bound for Albany at which place when we arrived  we took the rail for Buffaloo and on the way at chSchenectady  we joined Elders B. Young H. C. Kimball and Lyman Wight  making six of our quorum journeying homewards together.    We reached Buffaloo on the 25 and next  morning took steam boat and in 24 hours reached Cleavland  but Orson Hyde left us at Fairport to visit his family in  Kirtland.    Arriving at Detroit we spent the night of the  27th at the railroad Hotel and the next morning took steamboat  propeller Hercules for Chicago.    This was Sunday. I spent a part of   the day in writing. We had good State rooms and was  comfortable. We spoke much of our famlies and the death  of Joseph and Hyrum, and we felt anxious to get home.    President Young expressed his feelings to  me upon a variety of subjects and among other things he said  he wished me to keep an account of things as he should  look to me for his Journal some day. I had an  interesting time with Lyman Wight talking over old times  and looking forward to new ones.    Joseph's Presentiment that he would not see the Age of Forty.    During our conversation Lyman Whight informed me  that Joseph told him while they were in Gaol [jail] together ^in^ that he  Missouri that he should not live to see his fortieth year  of age but bid him not to reveal it until he was dead.    Two nights before our arrival in Nauvoo  Elder Kimball had a dream which he related to us. He 
 thought he was preaching to a large congregation upon the policy of the nation  and of the work of God, and he said Joseph had laid the foundation and we  should have to carry out his measures. Joseph was himself present and heard all  and sanctioned it. All seamed perfectly natural    We stoped at various places going down the Mississippi:  among others the town of Burlington. We then prepared our  minds to once more behold the City of Nauvoo and embrace  our families and friends.    August the 6th We were landed at the upper stone  house at 8  oin the evening and were welcomed with joy  by all the citizens we met. We hired a coach and I  accompanied my brethren to their families after which I  was conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to once  more meet with my wife children and friends.    When we landed in the city of Nauvoo  a deep gloom seemed to rest over it which we never experienced  before. This was August the 6th    The next morning I went through the  city of Nauvoo saw many friends and met in Council with  the quorum of the Twelve at Elder Taylor's whom we found  recovering from his wounds received at the massacre of the  Prophet and Patriarch of the Church.    We felt to rejoice at again having   the privilege of meeting together in council in Nauvoo  after passing through such trying scenes and to be welcomed  by the Saints who considered it Providential for the Twelve  to arrive at this Particular juncture when their minds were  agitated their hearts sorrowfull and darkness seemed to  cloud their path feeling like sheep without a shepherd their  beloved Prophet having been taken away.    We spent the forepart of the day in  Council at brother Taylor's and in the afternoon at 4 o'clock  the Twelve the High Council and the High Priests met  at the Seventies Hall. 
 After prayer by Wm Marks President of the   stake President Brigham Young called upon President Rigdon  to make a statement to the Church concerning his message to  the Saints and the vision and revelation he had received.    President Rigdon said, The object of my mission  is to visit the Saints and offer myself to them as a Guardian  I had a vision at Pittsburg June the 27th. This was presented  to my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuation  of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.    It was shown to me that this Church must  be built up to Joseph and that all the blessings we receive  must come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesman  to Joseph and I must come to Nauvoo and see that the  Church is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustains the  same relationship to this Church as he has always done. No  man can be the Succcessor of Joseph.    The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ  through Joseph. There must be revelation still. The  martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum   should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations  I have been consecrated a Spokesman to Joseph and I  was commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized  though our head is gone.    We may have a diversity of feelings  on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto  Joseph and I want to build up the Church unto him and  if the People want me to sustain this place I want it upon  the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for  himself.    I propose to be a Guardian to the people  In this I have discharged my duty and done what God has  commanded me and the people can please themselves  whether they accept me or not." 
 President Brigham Young said, "I do not care who  leads the Church even though it were Ann Lee; but one thing  I must know and that is what God says about it. I have   the Keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on  the subject.    I know there are those in our midst who  will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Joseph  and Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulness  of the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the   priesthood may remain.    Joseph confered upon our heads all the  keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he  himself held before he was taken away and no man or  set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in  this world or in the world to come.    How often has Joseph said to the Twelve  I have laid the foundation and you must build thereon  for upon your shoulders the kingdom rests.    The Twelve as a quorum will not be  permitted to tarry here long. They will go abroad and  bear off the Kingdom to the nations of the earth and baptize  the people faster than mobs can kill them off. I would  like were it my privilege to take my valise and travel and  preach until we had a people gathered who would be true.    My private feelings would be to let   the affairs of men and women alone & only go and preach  and baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet whatever  duty God places upon me in His strength I intend to fulfill  it.    I want to see this people with the various quorums  of the Priesthood assemble together in Special Conference  on Tuesday next at 10 o clock a.m." (which was carried  unanimously by vote) 
 At the request of William Marks who was  then Presiding over the Stake a special meeting was held next  morning at 10 o'clock to choose a Guardian or President and  Trustee. Sidney Rigdon took his position in a waggon  about two rods in front of the Stand and harangued the  Saints for about an hour and a half upon chosing a  Guardian for the Church. The meeting was then dismissed  when President Brigham Young gave out an appointment  for the brethren to assemble at 2 o'clock.    At the appointed time the brethren  came together. Present of the Twelve—Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Willard  Richards Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  The several quorums were organized on and around the   Stand according to order.    The meeting being opened President  Brigham Young arose and said, Attention all!  This congregation makes me think of the days of king   Benjamin the multitude being so great that all could  not hear. [##Mosiah 2:7-8##] I request the brethren not to have any feeling  for being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. We  want you all to be still and give attention that all may  hear. Let none complain because of the situation of  the congregation. We will do the best we can.    For the first time in my life—for the  first time in your lives—for the first time in the  Kingdom of God in the nineteenth Century without a  prophet at our head do I step forth to act in my calling  in connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles  of Jesus Christ unto this generation—Apostles whom  God has called by revelation through the Prophet Joseph  who are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of   the kingdom of God in all the world. 
 This people have hitherto walked by sight and not by  faith. You have had the Prophet in your midst. Do you all  understand? You have walked by sight and without much  pleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.  Heretofore you have had a Prophet as the mouth of the Lord to  speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;  and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith and  not by sight.    The first position I take in behalf of the Twelve   and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter-  day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want to  choose a Prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet   and Patriarch are taken from our midst do you want  some one to guard to guide and lead you through this  world into the Kingdom of God or not? All that want  some person to be a guardian or a Prophet a Spokesman  or something else signify it by raising the right hand  -[No votes]-    When I came to this stand I had peculiar  feelings and impressions. The faces of this people  seemed to say we want a Shepherd to guide and lead us  through this world. All who want to draw away  a party from the Church after them let them do it  if they can but they will not Prosper.    If any man thinks he has influence among  this people to lead away a party let him try it and he  will find out that there is power with the Apostles which   will carry them off victorious through all the world and  build up and defend the Church and Kingdom of God    What do the people want? I feel as  though I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn for  thirty days at least, then rise up shake myself  and tell the people what the Lord wants of them 
 Although my heart is too full of mourning to launch forth into  business transactions and the organization of the Church I feel   compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those duties  God has placed upon me.    I now wish to speak of the organization  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the  Church is organized and you want to know how it is   organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do   you want me to tell your feelings?    Here is President Rigdon who was Counselor  to Joseph. I ask, where are Joseph and Hyrum?  They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wants  to act as his counselor he must go beyond the veil where   he is.    There has been much said about President  Rigdon being President of the Church and leading the  people, being the head &c &c. Brother Rigdon has  come 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do for  you. If the people want President Rigdon to lead them  they may have him; but I say unto you that the  quorum of the Twelve have the Keys of the Kingdom  in all the world.    The Twelve are appointed by the finger   of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?  Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest   of the Twelve an indipendant body who have the  Keys of the Priesthood—the Keys of the Kingdom of  God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help  me God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the   First Presidency of the Church.    I do not know whether my enemies will   take my life or not and I do not care for I want to be  with the man I love. 
 You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer and  Revelator: God must do this. You are like children without  a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint  any man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordain  him. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if you  do want any other man or men to lead you take them and  we will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in all  the world.    I know who are Joseph's friends and who are  his enemies. I know where the keys of the Kingdom are  and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man  to be a Prophet; You cannot take Elder Rigdon and place   him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by them.    I tell you there is an over anxiety to hurry  matters here. You cannot take any man and put him  at the head; You would scatter the Saints to the four   winds; You would sever the Priesthood. So long as we  remain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operation  with us; and if you go out of that course God will have  nothing to do with you.    Again some perhaps think that our   beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured—would not  be looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remains  faithful he will not act against our counsel nor we against  his but act together and we shall be as one    I again repeat, no man can stand  at our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I have  spared no pains to learn my lesson of the kingdom in  this world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not so  I could go and live in peace; but for the Gospel and your  sakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to be  killed all the day long. You have never lived by faith.    Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid

 the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have never  seen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation  laid and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in the  world: we can build a Kingdom faster that Satan can kill the  Saints off.    What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch for  the whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing. If brother  Samuel H Smith had been living it would have been his  right and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to Joseph and  Hyrum; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and he  can waft himself with his brothers his friends and the Saints.    Do you want a Patriarch? Here is brother William  left; here is uncle John Smith, uncle to the Prophet Joseph left  It is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongs  to Joseph's family.    Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has there  been a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is his  business? To take charge of the temporal affairs so that  the Twelve and the Elders may go on their business. Joseph  condescended to do their business for them. Joseph  condescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the United  States and it was a great condescension.    Do you want a spokesman? Here  are Elder Rigdon brother Amasa Lyman (whom Joseph  expected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you want  the Church properly organized or do you want a spokesman  to be a chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to be  spokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but can  he now act in that office? If he wants now to be a  Spokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side   of the veil for the prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Why  will Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthood  or of the organization of the Kingdom of God? I am plain.

 Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want to  clip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the Keys go  and build up the Kingdom in all the world wherever the people will  hear them?    If there is a spokesman, if he is King and Priest let  him go and build up a Kingdom unto himself. That is his right. It  is the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.    I want to live on the earth and spread truth through  all the world. You Saints of Latter-days want things right. If  ten thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet Joseph Smith's  shoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you have  a right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Church  is organized.    Now if you want Sidney Rigdon or William Law  to lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but I  tell you in the name of the Lord that no man can put  another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. Why?  Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committed  into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last   dispensation for all the world. Don't put a thread  between the Priesthood of God.    I ask who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum?  I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a head  and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of   Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of that  Apostleship.    Brother Rigdon was at his side—not above.  No man has a right to councisel the Twelve but Joseph Smith  Think of these sayings ^things^. You cannot appoint a Prophet but   if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keys  of the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairs  of the Church and direct all things aright.    Now all this does not lessen the character of

 President Rigdon. Let him magnify his calling and Joseph will  want him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what   he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assunder  May God bless us all."    Much more was said by President Young  which I did not write.    Amasa Lyman said: I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratified  with the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seen  the relation I bear to my desceacsed brother. I never did conceive it gave  me precedance to go before the Twelve.    I do not make any exceptions to anything he has   said. I beleive there is no power or officer or means wanted to  carry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied that  no man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelve  as has been said.    There is one thing to secure the salvation of  this people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to know  the right and be united—it has been presented by President Young  All I design to do is to redeem my pledge.    President Young has stood next to the Prophet  Joseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I will  stand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith and  will be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will be  saved.    There is no nead of a President. We have a head  here. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostles  are that head. We now see the necessitty of the Apostleship.    I might rise up as well as any other man to  ask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering my  salvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvation  through all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it—the   first one called to do the same in all the world. If Joseph  had any power to bear off the Kingdom of God the Twelve

 have the same.    I could not advocate the choosing of a President and myself a candidate  so then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as the  Twelve did to Joseph either on one side or the other. I do not want to go before  them or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our united  faith and efforts."    President Rigdon called upon W. W. Phelps to speak in  his behalf as he could not speak himself.    W. W. Phelps arose and said: With the knowledge I have  I cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believe  enough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to act.    I have known many of them for 14 years and I have  always known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the Church  I have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in their  hands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer I  have seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts blood  and that is an evidence that they will walk by counsel.    I am happy to see this little lake of faces and  to see the same disposition and spirit manifested here to day as  it was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and Hyrum  Smith was brought home dead to this city: then you submitted to  the law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. And  I see the same thing here to day. You are now determined as  one man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I cam happy  that the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submit  themselves to the authority of the Priesthood.    I have feelings about this especially for President  Rigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve   belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I brought  President Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. I  could not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the world  he did receive part and I hope he will submit.    I want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on

 the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them go  on and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in a  guardian of the Church.    We have hitherto walked by sight and if any man  wanted to know anything he had only to go to brother Joseph.  Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortless.    I want to say that brother Joseph came and  enlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me the  same as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me in  his own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I asked  ^if the building was on wheels?^ He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove all  round the hills and Valleys. He then told the drivers to drive  on over the hill into Iowa. I told him Devil Creek was before  us. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creek  or any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.    There is a combination of persons in this city who  are in continual intercourse with William and Wilson Law who are  at the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Joseph  and there are persons now in this city who are only wanting power  to murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead and  build up the Temple and then you will be endowed: when the  Temple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel will  be endowed as well as the Elders.    If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;  If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your duty  and you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as I  have breath.    When Joseph was going away he said he was going  to die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am now  alive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to live.    I want you all to recolect that Joseph and   Hyrum have only been removed from the earth and they now  counsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder

 and ball.    Parley P. Pratt remarked: What has been said has been well  said. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they will  cease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If I  exchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to be  faithful.    If there are wicked men here it is because we support them  Stop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?  No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.    I am willing to do good to all men especially  to the household of faith Our enemies will cease to dwell here when  you cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will cease  when you cease to support them. I know we can all live and  be happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wants  a doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he can  find. I would die a natural death sooner than I would have  a wicked doctor to healp me off. I would go without sueing all  the days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I will  not say anything about the merchants because you all know them.    President Brigham Young again arose and said:  "There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we can  accomplish all we want to have done without without calling  this convention of the whole Church. I am going to present to  you the leading items.    I do not ask you to take my counsel or advise  alone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother Rigdon  is the person you want to lead you vote for him but not  unless you intend to follow him and support him any as  you did Joseph. Do not say so unless you mean to  take his counsel hereafter.    And I would say the same for the  Twelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unless  you intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not
