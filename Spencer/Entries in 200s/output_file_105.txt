Marsh an account of my labors upon Fox islands and the eastern country.30th, I left Scarborough and returned to the islands,I preached several times to large congregations in the Methodist meeting house, in East Thomastown, and in the town hall in Cambden, before crossing to the islands, where I arrived Augt. 79th, I received a letter from Thomas B. Marsh informing me of my appointment to fill the place of in the Quorum of the Twelve, of one who had fallen, and I was requested to come to Far West as soon as possible to prepare for a mission to England in the Spring. I immed-iately visited all the Saints upon both islands, and earnestly exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselvesto accompany me to the body of the church in Missouri.Several immediately sold, but many were poor.  Bro Nath.Thomas said he would furnish means to help off all the poor saints who would desired to go, and for this purpose went with me to the main land on the 13th, and I assisted him in procuring ^purshasing^ two thousand dollars worth of horses, ^harness,^ wagons, & tents &c. ^camp^ for the company, he paid about $1,500 of the expenses himself, $1,000 of which went to furnish conveyance for the poor, after purchasing the outfit for the company, and ^I^ urginged the importanceof their starting as soon as possible, not later than the first of Sep.Aug. 19, I left the town of Camden where we had prepared our outfit, and returned to Scarborough, to prepare my family for the journey, expecting to see the company in a few days, but here I

We hadbefore us, at this late period, a gloomy land journey of two thousandmiles, from Maine to Missouri; we continued to travel throughrain, mud, cold, frost and snow, until I ^we^ arrived in Rochester,Sangammon Co., Illinois, Dec. 19, where I stopped and settled my family and company for the winter ^being unable to proceed further,^; my wife had passedthrough a severe course of the brain fever while upon the journey,and her suffering had been very great, her spirit had left herbody twice to all human appearance, and only been called backthrough the prayer of faith and the power of God. Our childhad also been very sick and I had become so thoroughlychilled through my whole system, in crossing the bleak prairies,that it was two months after I stopped before I got sufficientlywarmed to feel natural.Bro. Thomas buried one child, and nearly all thecompany had been sick through exposure; some of them had stoppedby the way side.I spent the winter laboring with my hands for thesupport of my family.March 8th, 1839 I attended a conference at Springfield, Ills.,

 Joseph from time to time, as I had opportunity.July 22nd. I was with Prest. Joseph Smith and his council and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the prProphet., H^h^e healed many who were sick nigh unto death, among whom were Elijah Fordham and Joseph B. Nobles; even the wicked rabble followed to see the sick healed; as Joseph was about to cross the river a man came to him and asked him if he would go about 3 miles and heal two of his small children, who were twins, about 3 months old, and were sick nigh unto death; he was a man of the world, he had never heard a sermon preached by a latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but he would send a man, after a momen hesitating a moment, he turned to me and said you go with this man and heal his children, at the same time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and said, after you lay hands upon them, wipe their faces with it and they shall be healed; and as long as you will keep that handerkerchief it shall ever remain as a league between you and me: I went and did as I was told commanded, and the children wasere healed.On the 25th I was attacked with the chills and fever; I had a chill every other day and was very sick.On the ^Augt.^ 8th Octr. I laid my hands upon my wife and children, blessed them, committed them into the hands of God, and started upon my English mission, leaving my family sick, and with not more than 4 days provisions. Bro. Brigham Young rowed me across the river ^Mississippi^ in a boat; I was sick and feeble; when I landed I laid down upon the bank of the river on a side of Sole leather; the Prophet Joseph came along and looked at me and said, "You are starting on your mission";  I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a missionary, I look more fit for a hospital or dis^s^ecting room than a mission; he replied "what do you say that for, go ahead in the name of the Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed

 on your mission".  I thanked him. A Bro., came along with a wagon and carried me a few miles on my road, I startedwithout purse or scrip; I ^&^ passed by Parley P. Pratt who was hauling ^e^ ^hewing^ logs for a house, he was bare-foot, bare-headed, with-out coat or vest on, he said "I have no money but I have an empty purse, I will give you that." I went a few rods and found Elder ^H. C.^ Kimball building a log cabin, he said"I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse" he blessed me and I went my way, accompanied by Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the ague every other day,and lay on the bottom of the wagon while I traveled.We staid with Samuel ^H.^ and ^Don^ Carlos Smith at Macomb & held a meeting with the Saints, in that ^place whereo^ they contributed $9 to ^our^ necessities, and Geo. Miller gave us a horse.Father Coltrin was going East, he took us into his wagon to help us along; we spent five days in Springfield *[paper inserted over page]*where Elder Taylor had printed fifteen hundred copies of a thepamphlet, upon the Missouri persecution; also ^had^ had a trialwith Elder Babbitt ^who^ having prefered a charge against himfor improper conduct. We sold our horse[end of paper inserted over page]we administered to him, and he revived; on the follow-ing day he fell again, and fainted several times, it seemed as though the destroyer would take his life; we traveled with him 4 days after he was taken sick. His sickness proved to be an attack of the billious fever, we stopped with him two days, at a Mormon ^German^Tavern in Germantown, Wayne Co., Indiana, with a kind family, with whom he was acquainted; Father Coltrin would stay no longer; I proposed to remain with bro. Taylor, but as I was sick with fever & ague,and not able to take care of myself, bro. Taylor advised me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, saying"it is easier to take care of one sick man, than two." 
 I committed him into the hands of God; and the family promised to do all in their power to make him comfortable; I parted with ^from^ him with a heavy heart.Sep. On the 2nd, Novr. I continued my journey with Father Coltrin to Cleveland, Ohio, I there took steamer on the 10th for Buffalo; had a severe gale and did not reach Buffalo until the 12th. I traveled to Albany on a canal boat, had the ague daily, was very sick, had no com-panion except a sectarian priests who wasere daily lyinglying about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany for Farmington Ct. on the night of the 19th, and rode all night and the following day, suffered severely with fever and ague; I arrived at my father's house in Farmington on the 21st, quite sick; I found my father and family all well.On the 27th Sep., 1839, my Maternal Grand-mother, Anna Thompson, died aged 84; I was too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular incident, that my Grandfather , Lot Thompson, and Anna Thompson, his wife, Samuel Thompson and Mercy Thompson all of one family died in their 84th year.On the 4th October, Adnera Hart, died, bro^ther^ to my step mother, ^died,^ aged 43, he requested me to preach his funeral sermon; I had been sick at my father's house with the ague for fifteen days, attended with a severe cough, and the hour appointed for the funeral to take place was the time for my ague, yet I gave out the appointment,attended the funeral, and preached, an hour and a halfand I had no more ague for many days,. I left on the 7th, [blank] and visited New York, Long Island, ^&^ New Jersey; but was in very poor health.Nov 1st, I assisted Elders Clark, Wright and Mullinerto set sail for England. Elder John Taylor, ^had^ recovered from his sickness, and arrived in New York on the 13th Decr,

 1839On the 19th, Decr in company with Elders John Taylor & Theodore Turley I went on board the packet ship "Oxford"and sailed for Liverpool, where I landed January 11th, 1840, ingood health and spirits. When I left my Father, he gave mesome money to assist in paying my passage, also gave mefive dollars which he requested me to keep until I arrivedin Liverpool, saying, I would there need it; this I foundto be true after landing; that money was all we hadto pay our expenses to Preston; and we had two pence left.We arrived in Preston on the 13th had a happy interviewwith Bro. Willard Richards; held a council and agreedthat Elder Taylor go to Liver-pool, Turley to Birminghamand I go to Staffordshire Potteries.18th, I arrived in Manchester; met Elder Wm. Claytonwho presided over that branch, numbering 164 members, I was immediately called upon to visit a woman possessedwith the Devil; she was raging and foaming, and hadto be held by four men, the more we rebuked the Devil theworse she raged; we continued to pray and administeruntil we conquered and cast the Devil out of her, shearose and gave thanks to the Lord. The Devil then enteredinto a young child and we cast the Devil ^him^ out of thechild. I preached several times and laid hands ontwenty eight persons. I then went to Burslem on the 21stand met with Elder Alfred Cordon, President of the Burslembranch, which numbered 66. I commenced preaching inthe Staffordshire Potteries, Elder Taylor^urley^ left for Birminghamon the 29th. I remained in the Potteries some forty days, preachingdaily, baptizing, confirming and blessing children.On the 1st March ^1,^ as I met in the evening with alarge assembly in Hanly, the Lord revealed unto methat it would be the last time meeting that I would holdwith the Saints in the Potteries for many days; I told

A second Court was held on the 5th uponthe Same matterOn the 7th Mrs Woodruff andmyself met with the quorum and we had an interestingtime of instruction. I spoke during the day uponthe relationships which we sustain to our posterity andprogenitures in the Resurrection. We returned homeand offered up prayers for the Salvation of our friendsand retired to rest.During the month of January Elder Taylor

 TULLIDGE'SQUARTERLY MAGAZINE.No. I. OCTOBER, 1883. VOL. III.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF[Column 1]CHAPTER I.FAMILY SKETCH. MY EARLY DAYS AND MINISTRY.In tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family for more than three generations.My great grandfather, Josiah Woodruff, lived nearly one hundred years, and pos-sessed an iron constitution, and per-formed a great amount of manual labor nearly up to the time of his death. His wife's name was Sarah; she bore to him nine children as follows:—Josiah, Apple-ton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda, Phebe, and two names not given.My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of Josiah. He was born in Farmington, Hartford County, Connecti-cut, in 1751; he also possessed a strong constitution; it was said that he per-formed the most labor for several years of any man in Hartford County, and from over exertion in hewing timber he was attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, which caused severe lameness, for several years before his death. He mar-ried Dinah Woodford, by whom he had seven children, viz:—Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, and Ozem.Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Eliz-abeth, Amasa Frisby; Samuel, Miss Case; Aphek, Beulah Thompson and Azubah Hart; Titus, Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos Wheeler; and Ozem, Acksah Merrill and Hannah Hart; all of whom had large families.My grandfather died in Farmington, with the spotted fever in 1806, aged 55 years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in 1824, in the same place, with a cancer in the left breast; her sufferings were very great.My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born[Column 2]in Farmington, November 11th, 1778; he married Beulah Thompson (who was born in 1782) November 29th, 1801. She bore three sons, namely:—Azmon, born No-vember 29th, 1802; Ozen Thompson, born December 22nd, 1804; myself, born March 1st, 1807.My mother died with the spotted fever, June 11th, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving me fifteen months old. My father's second wife, Azubah Hart, was born July 31st, 1792; they were married November 9th, 1810; they had six children, viz: Philo, born November 29th, 1811, and died by poison administered by a physician No-vember 25th, 1827; Asahel Hart, born April 11th, 1814, and died in Terrahaute, October 18th, 1838; Franklin, born March 12th, 1816, and died June 1st; Newton, born June 19th, 1818, drowned September, 1820; Julius, born April 22nd, 1820, and died in infancy; Eunice, born June 19th, 1821. I married her to Dwight Webster in Farmington, Connecticut August 4th, 1841.My father was a strong constitutioned man, and has done a great amount of labor. At eighteen years of age, he com-menced attending a flouring and saw mill, and continued about 50 years; most of this time he labored eighteen hours a day.He never made any profession of re-ligion, until I baptized him with all his household into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the first day of July, 1838. He was a man of great charity, honesty, integrity and truth, and made himself poor by giving to the poor, and accommodating his fellow men by loan-ing money and becoming surety for his neighbors, and always saying yes, to every man who asked a favor at his hand.I was born in the north part of the town of Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut, March 1st, 1807. I assisted my father in attend- 
 much time to save and redeem their dead and gathertogether their living relatives that they may be savedalso before the earth will be smitten and the condemnationdecreed falls upon the worldI would advise all the Saints to goto with all their might and gather together all their livingrelations to this place that they may be sealed and saved that they may be prepared against the day whenthe Destroying Angel goes forth.If the whole Church should go towith all their might to save their dead, seal theirposterity and gather their living friends and spendnone of their time in behalf of the world theywould hardly get through when Night would comewhen no man could workMy only trouble at the presenttime is concerning ourselves—that the Saints willbe divided and broken up and scattered before weget our salvation secure; for their are so many foolsin the world for the Devil to operate upon it giveshim the advantage of ten timesThe question is frequently askedcan we not be saved without going through withall these ordinances? I would answer no; notwith the fulness of salvationJesus said there were manymansions in his Father's Kingdom and he wouldgo and prepare a place for them. ("House" in thetext should have been translated Kingdom). Anyperson who is exalted to the highest mansion has toabide a celestial law and the whole law too; buthere has been a great diffuculty in getting anythinginto the hearts of this generation. It has been 
 like splitting hemlock Knotts with a corn dogger [dodger] for a wedgeand a pumpkin for a beetle. Even the Saints are slow to understand. I have tried for a number of years to preparethe minds of the Saints to receive the things of God; butwe frequently see some of them after suffering all ^that^ they havefor the work of God fly to pieces like glass as soon as anythingcomes that is contrary to their traditions. They cant standthe fire at all. How many will be able to abide acelestial law and go through and recieve their exaltationI am unable to say; but many are called and feware chosen."

 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]ing the Farmington Mills, until I was twenty years of age.In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill of my aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I at-tended three years. In May, 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr. Col-lins, the ax manufacturer, in South Can-ton, Connecticut. At the end of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery. In March, 1831, I took charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. Richard B. Cowles, of New Hart-ford, Connecticut. In the spring of 1832, in company with my oldest brother, Azmon, I went to Richland, Oswego County, New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill, and settled in business.At an early age my mind was exercised upon religious subjects, although I never made a profession until 1830. I did not then join any church, for the reason that I could not find any denomination whose doctrines, faith or practice, agreed with the gospel of Jesus Christ, or the ordin-ances and gifts which the Apostles taught. Although the ministers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordinances, which the ancient saints en-joyed, were done away and no longer needed, I did not believe it to be true, only as they were done away through the unbelief of the children of men. I be-lieved the same gifts, graces, miracles and power would be manifest in one age of the world as in another, when God had a church upon the earth, and that the church of God would be re-estab-lished upon the earth, and that I should live to see it. These principles were riv-eted upon my mind from the perusal of the Old and New Testament, with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man: and the whisperings of the Spirit of the Lord for the space of three years, taught me that he was about to set up his church and kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I was taught these things from my youth by Robert Mason, an aged man, who lived in Simsbury, Con-necticut, who was frequently called the old prophet Mason; he taught me many things which are now coming to pass. He did not believe that any man had authority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith, prayer and fast-[Column 2]ing, to heal the sick, and cast out devils by the laying on of hands, which was the case under his administration, as many could testify.In 1832, I was inspired to go to Rhode Island; my brother, Asahel, was also directed by the Spirit of God to go to the same place. When we met, we both told our impressions, and it caused us to marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we had made preparations to move to the west, we let outward circumstances con-trol us, and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Island, we went to Richland, Oswego County, New York, and there remained until December 29th, 1833, when I heard Elders Zerah Pulsipher and Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Az-mon and I believed their testimony, en-tertained the elders, and offered ourselves for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon, and I re-ceived a testimony that it was true.We soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, for at the time we were warned to go there, two of the elders were preaching there, and had we gone, we should have embraced the work at that time.December 31st—I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me the same evening.January 2nd, 1834—I was ordained a teacher, and my brother Azmon, an elder, and a small branch was organized of 12 members by Elder Pulsipher.In February following, in company with Elder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the town of Fabius, to attend an evening meeting of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pulsipher was presid-ing; I saw the book of commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith, and I believed them with all my heart and rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-eral days, and holding several meetings, we returned home rejoicing.During the winter, we were visited by several of the elders. February 1st, Elder Parley P. Pratt called upon us and in-structed the branch till midnight; we had a precious time. I accompanied brother Pratt to Jefferson County, and told him my circumstances; he said it was my duty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and join the Camp of Zion. I immediately settled my business.

W. Phelps and he relatedto us the following dream"I was standing on a peninsula inthe midst of a large body of water where there appearedto be a large harbour or a pier built out for boatsto come into. I was surrounded by my friends and while looking at this harbour I saw a Steam-boat approaching it. There were bridges on the pier for persons to cross and there came up a windand drove the Steam-boat under one of the bridgesand upset it.I ran up to the boat expecting thepersons would all drown^ed^ and wishing to do somethingto assist them. I put my hand to the side of the boatand with one surge I pushed it under the bridge and itrighted it up and I told them to take care of themselves. 
 But it was not long before I saw them starting out into thechannel or main body of water again. The storms wereraging and the waters rough. I said to my friends thatif they did not understand the signs and the times andthe spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It wasbut a few moments after when we saw the waves breakover the boat and she soon foundered and went downwith all on board and perishedThe storm amd waters were still very rough; yet I told my friends around me thatI believed I could stem those waves and storm andswim in the waters better than the steam boatdid and that at any rate I was determined to tryit. But my freinds laughed at me and told me that I could not stand the storm at allbut should be drowned.The waters looked clear and beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that I beleived I could swim and that I would try itanyhow. They said I should drown. I answeredthat I would have a frolic on the water first if  I did and I drove ^dived^ off into the raging waves. I hadswam but a short distance when a towering waveoverwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myselfupon the top of it. I met the second wave inthe same way and for a while I struggled hard to live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmedthe torrent better and better. I soon had powerto swim with my head out of water so the wavesdid not break over me at all and I found that I swam a great distance. In looking aboutme I saw my brother Samuel by my side 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]April 11th, 1834—With my horses and wagon I took Brothers Harry Brown and Warren Ingles and started for Zion. I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch and other elders on the way, and ar-rived in Kirtland on the 25th day of April, 1834.The Prophet Joseph invited me to make his house my home; I accepted his offer, and staid with him about one week. I became acquainted with many of the high priests, elders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many of the elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.The first day of May, 1834, was ap-pointed for the Camp of Zion to start from Kirtland to go up to Missouri for the redemption of their brethren. Only a small portion of the Camp was ready. The Prophet told those who were ready, to go to New Portage and wait for the remainder. I left, in company with about twenty men, with the baggage wagons. At night we pitched our tents. I went to the top of the hill and looked down upon the Camp of Israel. I knelt upon the ground and prayed. I rejoiced and praised the Lord that I had lived to see some of the tents of Israel pitched, and a company gathered by the command-ment of God to go up and help redeem Zion.We tarried at New Portage until the 6th, when we were joined by the Prophetand eighty-five more men. The day be-fore they arrived, while passing through the village of Middlebury, the people tried to count them; but the Lord multi-plied them in the eyes of the people; sothat those who numbered them said therewere four hundred of them.On the 7th, Brother Joseph organized the camp, which consisted of about one hundred and thirty men. On the follow-ing day we continued our journey. We pitched our tents at night and had prayers night and morning. The Prophet told us every day what we should do.We were nearly all young men, gath-ered from all parts of the country, and strangers to each other; but we got ac-quainted very soon, and had a happy time together.It was a great school for us to be led by a Prophet of God a thousand miles,[Column 2]through cities, towns, villages, and through the wilderness.When persons stood by to count us they could not tell how many we num-bered; some said five hundred, others one thousand.Many were astonished as we passed through their towns. One lady ran to her door, pushed her spectacles to the top of her head, raised her hands, and exclaimed: "What under heavens has broken loose?" She stood in that posi-tion the last I saw of her.The published history of Zion's Camp gives an account of the bones of a man we dug out of a mound. His name was Zelph. The Lord showed the Prophet the history of the man in a vision. The arrow by which he was killed was found among his bones. One of his thigh bones was broken by a stone slung in battle. The bone was put into my wagon, and I carried it to Clay County, Missouri, and buried it in the earth.The Lord delivered Israel in the days of Moses by dividing the Red Sea so they went over dry shod. When their enemies tried to do the same, the water closed upon them and they were drowned. [##Exodus 14:21-31##]The Lord delivered Zion's Camp from their enemies on the 19th of June, 1834, by piling up the waters in Fishing River forty feet in one night, so our enemies could not cross. He also sent a great hail-storm, which broke them up and sent them seeking for shelter.The Camp of Zion arrived at Brother Burk's, in Clay County, Missouri, on the 24th of June, 1834, and we pitched our tents on the premises. He told some of the brethren of my company that he had a spare room that some of us might occupy if we would clean it. Our com-pany accepted the offer, and, fearing that some other company would get it first, left all other business and went to work, cleaning out the room, and imme-diately spread down our blankets, so as to hold a right to the room. It was but a short time afterwards that our brethren, who were attacked by cholera, were brought in and laid upon our beds. None of us ever used those blankets again, for they were buried with the dead. So we gained nothing but experi-ence by being selfish, and we lost our bedding.After Joseph, the Prophet, had led 
 I asked him how he liked it and he said first rate and I thought so too. I was soon enabled to swim with my head and shoulders out of water and I could swimas fast as any steamboat. In a little time it became calm and I could rush through the water onlygoing in up to my loins. Soon I only went in upto my knees and finally I could tread upon the top of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrowI said to Samuel se[e] how swift I can go and thought it was great pleasure to travel with such speed and I awoke."I continued to meet from time to timewith my quorum for the giving of the [redacted][redacted].Why Joseph was candidate for the Presidential ChairA congregation of the citizens met in the room over Joseph's Store to hear his views upon the affairsof government which had been written and was read by W. W. Phelps.Joseph gave his reasonsfor permitting his name to go forth as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. He said"I would not have suffered my name to have been used by my friends on anywiseas President of the United States or candidate for that office if I and my friends could have had the privilege of enjoying our religious and civil rights as American citizens even those rights which 
 And the Apostls taught.

 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]Zion's Camp to Missouri, and we had passed through all the trials of that jour-ney, and had buried a number of our brethren, as recorded in history, the Prophet called the Camp together, and organized the Church in Zion, and gave much good counsel to all.He advised all the young men, who had no families, to stay in Missouri, and not return to Kirtland. Not having any family, I stopped with Lyman Wight, as did Milton Holmes and Heman Hyde. We spent the summer together, laboring hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, making brick, or anything else we could find to do.In the Fall I had a desire to go and preach the gospel. I knew the gospel which the Lord had revealed to Joseph Smith was true, and of such great value that I wanted to tell it to the people who had not heard it. It was so good and plain, it seemed to me I could make the people believe it.I was but a Teacher, and it is not a Teacher's office to go abroad and preach. I dared not tell any of the authorities of the Church that I wanted to preach, lest they might think I was seeking for an office.I went to the woods where no one could see me, and I prayed to the Lord to open my way so that I could go and preach the gospel. While I was praying, the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and told me my prayer was heard and that my request should be granted.I felt very happy, and got up and walked out of the woods into the trav-eled road, and there I met a high priest who had lived in the same house with me some six months.He had not said a word to me about preaching the gospel; but now, as soon as I had met him, he said, "the Lord has revealed to me that it is your privi-lege to be ordained, and to go and preach the gospel."I told him I was willing to do what-ever the Lord required of me. I did tell him I had just asked the Lord to let me go and preach.In a few days a council was called at Lyman Wight's, and I was ordained a Priest and sent on a mission into Ar-kansas and Tennessee, in company with an elder. This mission was given us by[Column 2]Elder Edward Partridge, who was the first Bishop ordained in the Church.The law of God to us in those days was to go without purse or scrip. Our journey lay through Jackson County, from which the Saints had just been driven, and it was dangerous for a Mor-mon to be found in that part of the State.We put some Books of Mormon and some clothing into our valises, strapped them on our backs, and started on foot. We crossed the ferry into Jackson County, and went through it.In some instances the Lord preserved us, as it were by miracle, from the mob.We dare not go to houses and get food, so we picked and ate raw corn, and slept on the ground, and did any way we could until we got out of the county.We dared not preach while in that county, and we did but little preaching in the State of Missouri. The first time I attempted to preach was on Sunday, in a tavern, in the early part of December, 1834. It was snowing at the time and the room was full of people. As I com-menced to speak the landlord opened the door, and the snow blew on the peo-ple; and when I inquired the object of having the door opened in a snow storm, he informed me that he wanted some light on the subject. I found that it was the custom of the country.How much good I did in that sermon I never knew, and probably never shall know until I meet that congregation in judgment.In the southern part of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, in 1834, there were but very few inhabitants.We visited a place called Harmony Mission, on the Osage River, one of the most crooked rivers in the west. This mission was kept by a Presbyterian min-ister and his family.We arrived there on Sunday night at sunset. We had walked all day with nothing to eat, and were very hungry and tired. Neither the minister nor his wife would give us anything to eat, nor let us stay over night, because we were Mormons, and the only chance we had was to go twelve miles further down the river, to an Osage Indian trading post, kept by a Frenchman named Jereu. And this wicked priest, who would not 
 the Constitution guarantee unto all her citizens alike. Butthis we as a people have been denied from the beginningPersecution has rolled upon our heads from time to timefrom portions of the United States like peels of thunderbecause of our religion and no portion of the Governmentas yet has steped forward for our relief and underview of these things I feel it to be my right andprivilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfullyin the United States for the protection of injuredinocence and if I loose my life in a good cause Iam willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue righteousnessand truth in maintaining the laws and Constitution ofthe United States if need be for the general good ofmankind."Many other interesting remarks weremade. He was followed by Elders Hyde and Taylorand a unanimous vote was passed by the assembly to support Joseph.On the 20th I met in Councilin the morning with the Presidency and Twelve. Twomessengers arrived from the Pine Count^r^y with wordfrom Lyman Wight wanting counsel concerning preachingto the Indians. Joseph thought it wisdom notto do it and said that if Lyman Wight did ithe must do it upon his own responsibility and concludednot to send him any counsel but to let him actwith the best wisdom he had.Next day I again ^on the 21st of Feb^ met with thequorum of the Twelve at Joseph's store and accordingto Joseph's counsel we sellected a company to goon an exploring expedition to California and selecta spot to build a city.

 and Elders Yerslay Emmett [ink changes] were named for that expeditionWhile we were holding this council the Rev D. Wolfe an Episcopalian clergyman was preaching toa congregation of Saints in the other room. Whenhe closed President Joseph Smith followed and amongother remarks he said"Men may preach and practice everythingexcepting that which God commands us to do and theywill be damned at last. We may tithe our 'rue''annis' and 'caummin' and still not obey the commandmentsof God. The object with me is to obey and teachothers to obey God in just what He tells us todo. It mattereth not whether the principle is popularor unpopular I will always maintain a trueprinciple even if I stand alone in it."On the evening of Sunday the 25I met with the quorum and had an interesting timeWe had received information concerning the death ofJoseph Duncon and Governor Reynolds of Missouriwho shot himself through the head. They weretwo of the most inveterate enemies against theLatter-day Saints. This called forthA Notable Prophecy of JosephHe prophesied that within five years we shouldbe rid of our old enemies whether they were apostatesor of the world and wished us to record it thatwhen it came to pass we nead not say we had forgotton his saying.By special appointment a large assembly of Saints met on Thursday the 7th of Marchfor the purpose of advancing the progress of the

It is about time to draw our meeting to a close, and before closing I would like to say a very few words:Our attention has been drawn through the day to the travels of the missionaries, which is all very well, but before closing I wish to say to the people, I do not wish you to lose sight of the duties of saints; I want to have the Latter Day Saints keepin view the work in which they are engaged at home, and not forget it. We are engaged in what is termed a reformationhere in Great Salt Lake City. There are missionaries sentout through this City, who are sent out by the authorities to labor amoung the people, and do them good.I just wish to say to the brethren that I want to have yoube faithful, and look to the counsel we have received, and carry it out. I want to have the Bishops and missionaries, when they meet, unite themselves together in the spirit of the Lord. We donot wish to hear of any difference between the Bishops and missionaries. 
 W. W. feel as tho wanted to say a few words. it has seemedgood for missioneries, to be called, but we have notmet associated with the Bishops. I stand connected withyou as a missionary—the coy—here should be the lightof the Lord, never felt more responsibility.

 [Column 1]give us a piece of bread, lied to us about the road, and sent us across the swamp, and we wallowed knee-deep in mud and water till ten o'clock at night in trying to follow this crooked river. We then left the swamp, and put out into the prairie, to lie in the grass for the night.When we came out of the swamp, we heard an Indian drumming on a tin pail and singing. It was very dark, but we traveled towards the noise, and when we drew near the Indian camp quite a num-ber of large Indian dogs came out to meet us. They smelt us, but did not bark nor bite.We were soon surrounded by Osage Indians, and kindly received by Mr. Jereu and his wife, who was an Indian. She gave us an excellent supper and a good bed, which we were thankful for after the fatigue of the day.As I laid my head upon my pillow, I felt to thank God from the bottom of my heart, for the exchange of the bar-barous treatment of a civilized Presby-terian priest for the humane, kind and generous treatment of the savage Osage Indians.May God reward them both according to their deserts.We arose in the morning, after a good night's rest. I was somewhat lame, from wading in the swamp the night before. We had a good breakfast. Mr. Jereu sent an Indian to see us across the river, and informed us that it was sixty miles to the nearest settlement of either white or red men.We were too bashful to ask for any-thing to take with us to eat; so we crossed the river and started on our day's journey of sixty miles without a morsel of food of any kind.We started about sunrise and crossed a thirty-mile prairie, apparently as level as a house floor, without shrub or water. We arrived at timber about two o'clock in the afternoon. As we approached the timber a large black bear came out towards us. We were not afraid of him, for we were on the Lord's business, and had not mocked God's prophets as did the forty-two wicked children who said to Elisha "Go up thou bald head," for which they were torn by bears. [##2 Kings 2:23-24##]When the bear got within eight rods of us he sat on his haunches and looked at us a moment, and then ran away;[Column 2]and we went on our way rejoicing. We had to travel in the night, which was cloudy and very dark, so we had great difficulty to keep the road. Soon a large drove of wolves gathered around, and followed us. They came very close, and at times it seemed as though they would eat us up.We had materials for striking a light, and at ten o'clock, not knowing where we were, and the wolves becoming so bold, we thought it wisdom to make a fire; so we stopped and gathered a lot of oak limbs that lay on the ground, and lit them, and as our fire began to burn the wolves left us.As we were about to lay down on the ground—for we had no blankets—we heard a dog bark.My companion said it was a wolf; I said it was a dog: but soon we heard a cow bell. Then we each took a fire-brand and went about a quarter of a mile, and found the house, which was sixty miles from where we started that morning.It was an old log cabin, about twelve feet square, with no door, but an old blanket was hung up in the door-way. There was no furniture except one bed-stead, upon which lay a woman, several children and several small dogs. A man lay on the bare floor with his feet to the fire-place, and all were asleep. I went in and spoke to the man, but did not wake him. I stepped to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder. The moment he felt the weight of my hand he jumped to his feet, and ran around the room as though he was frightened; but he was quieted when we informed him we were friends.The cause of his fright was, he had shot a panther a few nights before, and he thought its mate had jumped upon him.He asked us what we wanted; we told him we wished to stop with him all night, and would like something to eat. He informed us we might lay on the floor as he did, but that he had not a mouthful for us to eat, as he had to de-pend on his gun to get breakfast for his family in the morning. So we lay on the bare floor, and slept through a long, rainy night, which was pretty hard after walking sixty miles without anything to

 Nov 23, 18563The Missionaries are sent abroad in connection with the Bishopsto labor for the welfare of the people. The missionaries needthe Holy Spirit, and the Bishops and their Counselors need the Holy Spirit that when we meet together one man need notthink because any ^other^ man is trmbling in his words he is abovehim— and not let any feelings rise in our breast that,one is greater than the other, and we must spend an hour to know who is to preside: and when we meet in a ward, no matterwho opens the meeting, or who calls for singing; whoever does this, let all unite with him.He have been called upon by the President to reform our-selves.My feelings are like this, I want to keep this in viewbefore the people; let us all rise up and endeavor to lighten theburden that is on the shoulders of these men: we can do it bythe aid of the spirit of God. ^As men who labor in Israel^ Our only object should be todo the people good. As missionaries we should not thinkthat we have to pound, as with a sledge all the time.I do hope as I am satisfied that there is a reformation;people do begin to repent, they do feel the necessily of waking 
 Temple &c. The quorum of the Twelve and Temple Committewere present with about seven or eight thousand SaintsHymns were sung and prayer offered up byParley P.

He saidThe object of this meeting is to stirup your minds by way of remembrance. It is necessaryto have a starting point to build the Temple. With theassistance of the sisters we expect to get the nails andglass and with the assistance of the brethren we intendto do the rest. I will proclaim in public and privatethat the Sisters bought the glass and nails by pennysubscription. Choose ye this day whom yewill serve!We shall call upon this vastmultitude for a donation to buy powder and fuse ropeto blast the rocks in the quarry. We want thebrethren to do as much as the sisters. We donot intend to finish the Nauvoo House thisseason but to finish the Temple or the wallsof it this Summer get the roof on by Decemberand do the inside next winter and in about ayear from this Spring we will dedicate itWe can do anything we undertake We havepower and we can do great thingsIn five years to come the workwill progress more than it has in ten years of the past.

 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]eat. That was the hardest day's work of my life.The man's name was Williams. He was in the mob in Jackson County: and after the Saints were driven out, he, with many others, went south.We got up in the morning and walked in the rain twelve miles to the house of a man named Bemon, who was also one of the mob from Jackson County. They were about sitting down to breakfast as we came in.In those days it was the custom of the Missourians to ask you to eat even if they intended to cut your throat as soon as you got through; so he asked us to take breakfast, and we were very glad of the invitation.He knew we were Mormons; and as soon as we began to eat he began to swear about the Mormons. He had a large platter of bacon and eggs, and plenty of bread on the table, and his swearing did not hinder our eating, for the harder he swore the harder we ate, until we got our stomachs full; then we arose from the table, took our hats, thanked him for our breakfast, and the last we heard of him he was still swear-ing.I trust the Lord will reward him for our breakfast.In the early days of the Church, it was a great treat to an Elder in his travels through the country to find a Mormon; it was so with us. We were hardly in Arkansas when we heard of a family named Akeman. They were in Jackson County in the persecutions. Some of the sons had been tied up there and whipped on their bare backs with hickory switches by the mob. We heard of their living on Petit Jean River, in the Ar-kansas Territory, and we went a long way to visit them.There had recently been heavy rains, and a creek that we had to cross was swollen to a rapid stream of eight rods in width. There was no person living nearer than two miles from the crossing, and no boat. The people living at the last house on the road, some three miles from the crossing, said we would have to tarry till the water fell before we could cross. We did not stop, feeling to trust in God.Just as we arrived at the rolling flood a negro, on a powerful horse, entered[Column 2]the stream on the opposite side and rode through it. On our making our wants known to him, he took us, one at a time, behind him and carried us safely over, and we went on our way rejoicing.We arrived that night within five miles of Mr. Akeman's, and were kindly entertained by a stranger. During the night I had the following dream:I thought an angel came to us, and told us we were commanded of the Lord to follow a certain straight path, which was pointed out to us, let it lead us wherever it might. After we had walked in it awhile we came to the door of a house, which was in the line of a high wall running north and south, so that we could not go around. I opened the door and saw the room was filled with large serpents, and I shuddered at the sight. My companion said he would not go into the room for fear of the serpents. I told him I should try to go through the room though they killed me, for the Lord had commanded it. As I stepped into the room the serpents coiled them-selves up, and raised their heads some two feet from the floor, to spring at me. There was one much larger than the rest in the centre of the room, which raised his head nearly as high as mine and made a spring at me. At that instant I felt as though nothing but the power of God could save me, and I stood still. Just before the serpent reached me he dropped dead at my feet; all the rest dropped dead, swelled up, turned black, burst open, took fire and were consumed before my eyes, and we went through the room unharmed, and thanked God for our deliverance.I awoke in the morning and pondered upon the dream. We took breakfast, and started on our journey on Sunday morning, to visit Mr. Akeman. I re-lated to my companion my dream, and told him we should see something strange. We had great anticipations of meeting Mr. Akeman, supposing him to be a member of the Church. When we ar-rived at his house he received us very coldly, and we soon found that he had apostatized. He brought railing accusa-tions against the Book of Mormon and the authorities of the Church.Word was sent through all the settle-ments on the river for twenty miles that two Mormon preachers were in the place. 
 4up to their duty, but there is still room for us to reformfor you and me to get now of the Holy Spirit, and thenwe have less labor for these missionaries, and never ceasebefore we do feel justified before we do feel justified before theLord, that we have done our duty to our God and to all toall men. Wherein there is any thing for us to make rightlet us never cease until that is done. Let us get the HolySpirit and carry it with us wherever we go, that we may beguided any governed by that spirit, and when we do thisno matter in what capacity we labor, there will be a good influence felt; The people will feel that we can do themgood, they will feel that our only object is to [soley] to benefitthem. Let the missionaries and bishops be united in the spirit of God when they meet, and let their only object beto benefit the people; let every man unite, and pray allthe time that these men may have the spirit of God, and gift of the Holy Ghost.There is room yet for us to reformand obtain more of the spirit of the Lord.

I apologize fornot coming sooner.I have had so much on mymind since I saw you that I hardly know whereto begin; but one of the grand objects which I hadin view in calling this meeting was to make afew remarks relative to the laws and ordinancesand the building of the Temple.The reason I want to speak ofthe laws is that the officers have difficulties inadministering the laws.

Another says, she has seen youhave intercourse with a woman, and can you sayyou have not had intercourse with this woman.We want you to confess it. We do not want youto tell a lie before God, men, holy Angels, and thedevil for if you lie the Judgments of Godwill fall upon you. 
 W. Woodruff. I realize our missionary meetings in onesense of the word are the most uninteresting of any we hold inthe city; but they are very necessary. I will explain myself.We have to sit here from six o'clock to nine to hear thesereports; a man merely has to give a very short item of the Stateof his ward things in his ward: but nevertheless it seems to be 
 Elder Woodruffs Speech delivered at a Council ofthe Seventies held at the Seventies Council Hall, Decr 22nd, 1856Elder Woodruff rose and declared, that, he lived as long as he will, and see iniquity and not rebuke it, and his feelings he declardunto God and the Holy Ghost. Who does not know that Judge Stiles haslied against God, the Holy Ghost, the holy Angels and these his Brethren.The women have acknowledged the crimes they were guilty of, and have insome measure redeemed themselves. He wanted to say to these Brethrenthat were round him; these Presidents of Seventies; that, it was timewe rose up and rebuked sin. The time has come when the Seventiesshould get the gift and power of the Holy Ghost for God requires thatthey rise up and get rid of these adulterers and adultresses. He hadlearned too much of the gift of God and the power of the Holy Ghost, &say a man was not guilty when he was. We had now got to standup in defense of the principles of truth. Let Br Jedediah who has spokenand warned these Presidents bear witness that, if we do not wake up,the Judgments of God will be upon us. He loved these Presidents. Br Pulsipher was the first man he heard preach the Gospel. He had baptized him and ordained him a teacher. He wanted to see him wake up, alsothese Presidents. There was a great responsibility resting upon them. He addressing them, ^he^ saying^id^ Rise up my Brethren in the majesty of your calling;then, when any man speaks, you may know whether he has the Spirit and 
 6necessary that we do meet. I name this because I do not want the brethren to be discouraged. In another senseit is not uninteresting to know the feelings in the minds of the Saints, but there is a sameness. I hope that samenesswill all be by & bye of the best kind.I have a few items that I want to speak of, thatI have taken as I passed along. The first is what BrotherHaven said with regard to catechising the people by those ^in^ families. I would prefer to adopt a unifaorm system inthis we go into a family and ask the man; he has half a dozenwives and twenty children: you ask that man, are you willingto be catechised together. The man feeling perhaps that he hasnot done anything he is afraid to have his wives know: perhapsone of his wives may be guilty of adultery, or stealing, and therest of the family not guilty. The moment that woman saysshe wants to be catechised alone, the whole of the rest of the familyare suspicious of it. You will all see that you go into afamily, a woman has been guilty of committing adultery Itmay be the moment that man knows that it is a dagger 
 virtue to them they will oppose it. If you preach the MethodistGod to them they will oppose that also ore anything else andif there is any case tried they want it appealed to Carthage.Mr Boswicks case had to go there. Our lawyers willsend anything to Carthage.I want to know if the citizens willsustain me when my hands are raised to heaven for thepeople. I will arraign the person before the peoplewho acts against the interest of the city and I shall havethe voice of the people which is republican and as likelyto be the voice of God.As long as I have a tongue to speakI will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wickedmen. I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling overof Hell nor its thunders and forked lightning.I despise the man who will betray you with a kiss. Here is Hyrum Kimball. He hasset at naught the ordinances of the city by saying thathe owns the warf, and steamboats need not pay them.Wherefore? This body is the highest court. Whatappeal to Carthage? I would not appeal there if Idied a thousand deaths. Neither Kimball norMorrison owns the warfage. Water street runsalong the beach and belongs to the city and not individuals.I will reprove the lawyers anddoctors. Jesus did and every prophet has and if I am a prophet I shall also do it. At any rateI shall do it for I profess to be a Prophet.The laws and Constitution of the United States have ceded the right to corporated cities to regulate all warfage of shiping and steamboats &cAll laws of taxation are subject to the city and not to individuals; and I want from this time forth 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]A mob was soon raised, and warning sent to us to leave immediately or we would be tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail and hanged. I soon saw where the serpents were. My companion wanted to leave; I told him no, I would stay and see my dream fulfilled.There was an old gentleman and lady, named Hubbel, who had read the Book of Mormon and believed. Father Hub-bel came to see us, and invited us to make our home with him while we stayed in the place. We did so, and labored for him some three weeks with our axes, clearing land, while we were waiting to see the salvation of God.I was commanded of the Lord by the Holy Ghost to go and warn Mr. Ake-man to repent of his wickedness. I did so, and each time he railed against me, and the last time he ordered me out of his house. When I went out he followed me and was very angry. When he came up to me, about eight rods from the house, he fell dead at my feet, turned black and swelled up, as I saw the ser-pents do in my dream.His family, as well as ourselves, felt it was the judgment of God upon him. I preached his funeral sermon. Many of the mob died suddenly. We stayed about two weeks after Akeman's death and preached, baptized Mr. Hubbel and his wife, and then continued on our journey.We concluded to go down Arkansas River and cross into Tennessee. We could not get passage on the boat, be-cause of the low water, so we went on the bank of the river and cut down a sound cottonwood tree, three feet through, and cut off a twelve-foot length from the butt end ; and in two days we dug out a canoe. We made a pair of oars and a rudder, and on the 11th of March, 1835, we launched our canoe, and commenced our voyage down the Arkansas River, without provisions.The first day we sailed twenty-five miles, and stopped at night with a poor family who lived on the bank of the river. These kind folks gave us supper and breakfast, and, in the morning, gave us a johnny-cake and a piece of pork to take with us on our journey.We traveled about fifty miles that day, and at night stopped at an old tavern, in a village called Cadron, which was de-[Column 2]serted because it was believed to be haunted by evil spirits.We made a fire in the tavern, roasted a piece of our pork, ate our supper, said our prayers, went into a chamber, lay down on the bare floor, and were soonasleep.I dreamed I was at my father's house in a good feather bed, and I had a good night's rest. When I awoke the bed vanished, and I found myself on the bare floor and well rested, not having been troubled with evil spirits or anything else.We thanked the Lord for His good-ness to us, ate the remainder of our pro-visions and continued our journey down the river to Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas, which then consisted of only a few cabins.After visiting the place, we crossed the river and tied up our canoe, which had carried us safely one hundred and fifty miles.We then took the old military road, leading from Little Rock to Memphis, Tennessee. This road lay through swamps, and was covered with mud and water most of the way, for one hundred and seventy miles. We walked forty miles in a day through mud and water knee-deep.On the 24th of March, after traveling some ten miles through mud, I was taken lame with a sharp pain in my knee, I sat down on a log.My companion, who was anxious to get to his home in Kirtland, left me sit-ting in an alligator swamp. I did not see him again for two years. I knelt down in the mud and prayed, and the Lord healed me, and I went on my way rejoicing.On the 27th of March, I arrived at Memphis, weary and hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I told him I was a stranger and had no money. I asked him if he would keep me over night.He inquired of me what my business was.I told him I was a preacher of the gospel.He laughed and said that I did not look much like a preacher.I did not blame him, as all the preachers he had ever been acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine car- 
 and power of God on him or not. When a man rises up to cover hissins, there is no salvation there. He for one would be true to thosemen who lead him if it cost him his life. He wanted to take offthe incubus that had been resting so long upon his Brethren thePresidency. He was glad Br Hyde and the Twelve were he[re], for they would search Zion as with a lighted candle. There w aisa perfect stream of corruption coming up constantly, and if Godand his servants wanted friends to assist them it was day. He called upon his Brethren of the Twelve and the Seventies to standas a Bulwark between the Presidency and the Church of God. Menhave betrayed women, and if men and women commit whore-doms, he would say let somebody draw the sword, and let themgo to hell. If these Brethren will take hold as Quorums, and as the heart of one man we will sustain ourselves.(2 Speech of) Elder Woodruff wanted to back up those thingsspoken by Br Richards for the Lord knows it they are true. Hewanted the Brethren to call their Quorums together, andtake the Catechism and weigh their Quorums by that Catechismand root out from their Quorums the iniquity that was amongthem. He loved the Presidents of these Quorums.What Br Richards said was true. The Twelve Apostles hadgot to wake up, and if these Brethren do not wake up, they will be removed. He thanked God that his Brethren of the

BOX 1678.Salt Lake City, Utah, [blank] 189Terre-haute Oct. 18, 1838; Franklin, born March 12, 1816, died June 1; Newton, born June 19, 1818, drowned Sept. 1820; Julius, born April 22, 1820, died in infancy; Eunice, born June 19, 1821. I married her to Dwight Webster, in Farmington,Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.My father at 18 worked in a flouring & saw mill, and continued about 50 years, laboring 18 hours a day most of the time.I baptized him and all his house-hold into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints July 1, 1838. He was very honest & very charitable, freely loaning ^to neighbors,^ or giving to the poor,always saying yes to those who asked a favor.I was born in north part of Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford county, Conn. March 1, 1804. I worked with my father till 20 years old. In April 1827 I took the flouring mill of 
 7to his heart all the days of his life: just so with a womanlet her know that her husband has been guilty of adultery.Don't you see you destroy families the moment you pursuethat course. We can all see the wisdom of taking themindivually to catechise them. The more I see the operation ofit:, the more I see the wisdom of it, and then we do not createany suspicion.Again I want to say; in the organization of thismissionary operation; we have not organized the missionariesfor the whole Territory, although some of the missionaries didgo out. We have not to the present day organized the missionariesabroad, so that we do not feel that there is any use censureto any of the Brethren abroad, because they have not beencounselld to do it.Again concering the remarks that Bro(Geo. D.) Grant made with regard to the 11th & 12th wards I feelsatisfied with it, to let those Bishops, if they desire to take it upon themselves, that they should go and catechise their wards; and if the Bishops feel disposed to liberate the missionaries from that. Those Bishops are qualified; to know ^but when^ 
 Quorum of the Twelve were with him. He felt to tremblewhen he considered that these ^were^ Forty Quorums of Seventyshere, and these Presidents can't get power enough to trim them up. The powers of the Kingdom of Heavenare ready, and we cannot stand any longer in the wayof the rolling of the Ark of the Kingdom of God. Josephand Hyrum, and David and Jedde, and a host of others are at our back and ready for us, and if hecould do any thing, he would do it if it cost him hislife. Let all your Quorums work and fast andpray until they get the Spirit of God. We, of the Twelve are willing to be with you; also Br Hyde with his fan in his hand and we will kindle a fire here.These ^Brethren of^ Presidents Breth have not got the spirit of theirApostleship upon them. They should rise up, or go toBr Brigham, and make their feelings known to himin this matter. He was glad to meet them here to night.Go to battle either spiritually or temporally.Dont sleep under this matter. Visit every tree planted in your Quorum, and God will bless you, and dont be afraidand he will be with you with his free spirit which is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 
 8anything is revealed to them they should not reveal it to any man, and if it is any thing that they do not feel ^able^ to handlelet them bring it to us, and if we can't handle it, we willtake it to President Young. I feel to impress that upon the minds of the brethren, when a matter is revealed to you, neverreveal it to any mortal man again.There is another subject; concerning these relief societies;now President Young recommended these female relief societies:that the societies should takeI have not heard of much being done with regard to it.The 14th ward organized that society, and it is a great relief to the Bishop poor. They have sustained the poor; they have takenevery case from the hands of the Bishop: as the poor have comein they have gone to this society. The sisters get together andmake up their quilts and clothing, and appropriate a littlewithout feeling it much. I thought I would name this tothe missionaries: It would be a good plan for them to keepthis in mind, it may probably do some good--good will growsout of it. 
 9Another thing was on any mind with regard to the wardswhere they are so scattered crowded. weI waent into the Seventiesbut they were three tier deep through, as full as people can be; itis so in many of the wards, and many of the ward have to go home. My feelings have been, if I could manage it I would have male and female meetings, and block meetings;or take a part of the ward, and give the people the privilege, for every Thursday have the ward as to leave or crowd in tillthe house is filled to Suffocation. The Bishop in Provo, itwas in the beginning. He told them the time would comewhen a seat in this House will be an item here in Provo. Theyhave seen that day, and after the have a house full, andlet the people out, there is another congregation ready to rushinto it; and it is so in many other places. We shouldtry to do something for the relief of the people, and I wouldrecommend that you change those meetings so that they can allget out to some meeting. These were about the items I wantedto name.With regard to the law of consecration as that subject 
 10came up--the law of consecration; there is no law upon it;when President Young took that subject up there was nocommandment; he did not require it unless the peoplefelt disposed to do it; but it is one of the first laws, Godrevealed. He called upon them to consecrate their all in the Kingdom of God. The Twelve and leading men of thisChurch and Kingdom counted it a glorious blessing to walkup and consecrate all that they haved. If I could put intoit my wives and children I would have done it. I should haveput every thing I could think of, and if the Lords wantsanything we have, it is all right. If this people really understand what their privileges are, there is not one of youthem but what would desire to consecrate all youthey have, because it is one of the first laws of God. A great many of the people have gone forward and done it. This is all I want to say upon this matter. Some of the Brethren would tell aboutthe reformation among the Children. I would like to say, we arelittle children, and should be humble, and be capable to be somethingthat will do some good. 
 11I want to say when people turn their attention fromloafering, and turn their attention to something that willbring some good to pass; ^from^ that moment they donot feelthey could throw away one solitary moment, if they onlyhad the spirit of the most High God upon them, to see whatthey were made for: and we as priests, apostles, and Elders,take us as a body, if our lives eyes had been opened as they arenow in a measure there is not one of us but what would feelwe have no time to spend in folly and nonsense, but to bringabout all the good we can. I remember a remark Josephmade, said he Be artful here, in speaking of the endownments, you should go to work and use your privileges, and not spenda whole life, and get no blessing sealed upon you; watch everynook and corner where you can get a blessing sealed upon you. Let us as missionaries--our work is not done wehave only just begun. A remark was made with regardto taking care of the oil and wine, and alluding to saving everybody that can be saved; and with regard to people confessing 
 12their sins: what does it do? It opens the field, and shows to us something that we never saw, and hardly expected to see;this shows a scenery of things to us. What are we going to do? We are going to try to save every body that can be saved.There is no man but what has failed somewhere; you canhardly find a man in all Israel, but you put him in thescale and he will righteously way up every where. We haveall been subject to temptation; we have had a failing heare, and another there, and we have all, the very best of us, done thingsin our life we have been sorry for, and had it not been for thetemptation we never would have done it. There are a greatmany men in Israel, that have done this thing that was wrong,and they are good men and women, and have been overcomein a moment of temptation. If we were to go to work, and destroy every body that has done wrong you would have nobodyto be saved. The idea is, as long as the Lord says, we willforgive this people. The President, who holds the keys, says, I will forgive this people; we will do just so too, as long as we 
 13see the people willing to repent, but I do want the missionariesto impress this one thing upon men who confess heinous sins:they should not be so lightly passed over that they do nothave any feeling about time it; if they have not had theweight upon them so that they have had a godly sorrow, they should have something to make them; they should have a a repentance that will not be repented of, and that the Almightywill give him the Holy Spirit. When we meet with people thatare willing to forsake their sins, we should be very careful of themand try to save them. I go in for this principle to save thepeople. You have gone to work here in the City of Salt Lake asa body of saviors in Mount Zion. Well now, no doubt but youhave been instruments in the hands of God of freeing the heartsof a great many. You will find men & women that are stillcommitting Adultery, and the devil holds that up to them allthe time & tells them that they cannot do anything: the deviltakes that advantage, the missionaries should strike thatdown, and tell them to tell the devil to go away and letthem forsake their sins, and rise up and get the spirit, and let 
 15that are not willing, but go right into the corn you wlill see they will go by the board.There is one thing that is a consolation to me it is the officers in the Church and Kingdom; that is their element,universally, get hold of this spirit and see the necessityof being saved. You will see a few men that will coverin a measure their sin; you will see a few that do not seethe importance of it. The majority of this people are beginning to feel the importance of it; how different the element was when you first began in your wards: how different it is with me when I go among the Seventies andHigh Priests, it seemed as if I wanted to call upon twentymen to lift the roof off the house, it is not so now, we donotfind the same element we did a few months ago. The peopleare beginning to feel the spirit; the Bishops, Missionaries, and all are beginning to feel it, & When you go to a man or woman full of faith in that you can do them good. We shouldall try to do one another good. I feel as though you will see the 
 156fruits of your labors. I do not believe you will see thisKingdom settle back and go to sleep; if it does we maytake our knapsacks, and go into the wilderness. TheLord will not wait upon this people any longer if they goto sleep again, you will see judgement laid right straightto the line, and justice will walk up, and mercy will standright back; this is the way I feel about it, and I do feel the missionaries will should impress it upon every man either in this Territory or abroad. If you will see a man that willconfess his sins, and ^he^ should feel impression upon him thatthat must be the last time, if he does not, he will inherit sorrowunto himself, that he will not get right off as easily as he has.Men have gone and said, wYou are forgiving all manner of sinexcept the sin against the Holy Ghost. Says I so do I, and theLord says he will too. No man will get right rid of payingfor his sins, I never commited a sin in my life but what costsme more, ten times more than it was worth; every man has topay for his sins; there is no trifling with them. The Lord in 
 17mercy has come out and told us from the heavens, with the voice of the prophet, I will forgive your sins, they shallnot be brought against you any more. What more does a people ask for. Give them to understand if they areever catechised hereafter it will be from the winter of1856-[185]7, and if they commit sins hereafter they will be brought to judgement, and it will be laid to the line, &there will not be the mercy that is now shown.Well, I pray that God may bless you, and may bless us all, and fill us with revelation, with the Holy Spiritof God. Go into a ward and the spirit of God willreveal every thing that is around you. If a man lies to youyou should know it, it is your privilege so to do.

 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met atFather Cornors & held three meetings through the day and eveningwe red in the Book of Mormon, broke bread to theSaints. I felt the Spirit of God bare testimony tome that there would be a great work in LondonWe retired to rest in good season. I felt well inmy mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at nightI awoke and meditated upon the things of God untillabout 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a determina-tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcomethe powers of darkness which were besetting us day byday and trying to overcome us. As I was formingthis determination in my own mind a personage appearedunto me which I considered was the prince of darkessdarkness or the Devil, he made war with me and attemptedto take my life he laid hold of me like a strongarmed man, I felt like the wait of a heavy manlying upon my body and he caught me by the throatwith a strong grip and choaked me nearly to deathI struggled with him as one man would struggledwith another I, felt as though this destroyer would overcomme & that I must die as I saw no way that I couldescape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to mewhy do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help, I thenasked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliverme from the power of the Devil & preserve my lifeinstantly three personages came throught the door dressedin white with considerable light surrounding them theycame up to the bed side while I was lying in the graspof the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & inthe twinkling of an eye I was liberated & the spirit of Godvibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the soulsof my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a highstate of persperation water stood upon ^me^ in drops. As soonas I could speak I spoke to Brother G. A. Smith &I found that he had been labering under the same

One MrBarrett had tried hard for a length of time to getsome of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him, thoughhis continued teazing [president] Brigham Young told himthe Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject withhim but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonismhe would appo[in]t some body to meet him, as Mr Barryttwould not take no for an answer Brother Alfred Cordonwas appo[in]ted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were wasa beardless boy yet he had been ordained an Elder &received much of the Spirit of the Lord and they metfor this purpose at early candle light, the Stand wasoccupied on one side by my Methodist Priest, & on theother side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lytedby 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighthed withgass there were some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-self to prove th Book of Mormon false & water baptism^not^ essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon plegedhimself to prove the Book of Mormon true & waterbaptism essential to Salvation.  As Mr Barrytt arose& declyaired to the Assembly that he would prove the Book ofMormon false & water baptism not essential toSalvation 4 glass chimneys in each of the chanderliers burst 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the CongregationAnd the man who had tended the gass in the Hall saidfor twenty years said he had never knownany [wei[r]der] of the kind. the chimneys were replaced& the discussions went on I set by the side of DoctorW Richards, and at the commencement of the meetinga very interesting old gentleman appeared in the congrega-tion he sat at the end of a seat joing the ally nearthe platform, He made me think of what he s is said ofthe Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & restedin a large white roll upon his shoulders, he was a noblelooking man he eyed us with great interest &penetration, he occupied his seat to our view thensome half an hour I called the attention of DoctorRichards to him we both looked at him with feelingsof both interest, some little disturbance in another partof the Home attracted our attention & when wereturned our eyes to the seat of our interesting visitorwe found his seat vacant, & he had disappearedthere for the first time we felt that we had beenvisited by John the Revelator or one of the threeAncient Nephite, however the discussion went onMr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordon greivedthe victory, & quite a number of the methodist who attended that discussion, was baptized & joined the LatterDay Saints 
 Autobiography of Wilford WoodruffThe remaining months ofthe year 1841 was spent by theTwelve, after their return fromthis successful mission in Gto Great Britain, in settlingtheir families in Nauvoo andtaking charge of the affairs ofthe affairs Church. Severalnoteworthy events took place at thistime among which were thededication of the baptismal fontin the Temple by the Prophet andthe Twelve and the first adminis-trations of the ordinance of 
 baptism for the dead, both ofwhich occurred on Sunday Nov 21st,1841. A large congregationassembled and Elders BrighamYoung, Heber C. Kimball andJohn Taylor baptized about fortyand persons and Elders WillardRichards, George A Smith andWilford Woodruff confirmed them.During the following weeka company of about 200 Saintsarrived from England, and I wasnow again in the midst ofhundreds whom I had baptizedin America, the "Islands of the Sea"and England and Wales. 
 Just before the April Conferencethe Prophet administered theordinance of rebaptism to theChurch, baptizing many himself,among whom were the Twelve,who afterwards assisted himin baptizing and confirmingthe multitude. This was thefirst time I was rebaptized. Atsince my [ent] the ProphetJoseph administeredthe close of the administrationthe Prophet lifted up his handsto heaven and blessed the people and the Spirit of 
 God rested upon the congregationAt the April Conferencethere were 275 ordained tothe office ^under the hands^ of Elders, BrighamYoung, Heber C Kimball,Orson Pratt, Lyman Wight,Willard Richards, George ASmith and Wilford Woodruff.offi While these ordinations weregoing on Elder John Taylor wasin the stand delivering adiscourse to the multitude,while others of the Elders werebaptizing and confirmingat the font and elsewhere. 
 afterwards this was done by the power of Godand not of man. We laid hands upon twentyin Manchester who were sick and they were ^mostly^ healedOn the 21 I arrived in Burslem by coach andmet for the first time with Elder Alfred CordonThis being my field of labor I stoped and commencedwork Elder Turly stoped in the pottery Districtsome 8 days then went to Birmingham his field oflabor in preaching baptizing bonfirming & blessing childrenI received a letter on the 10 Feb from Elder JohnTaylor at Liverpool saying they had commenced there andbaptized 10 person, I labored in the Staffordshirepotteries in Burslem, Hanly Stoke Lane End andseveral other villages from the 22 Jan untill the2nd day of March one month & 7 days preachingery night in the week and two or 3 times on the Sabbath I baptized, confirmed, & blessed many childrenand we had a good field open for laborand many were believing, and it appeared as thoughwe had a door open to bring many into the Churchin that part of the vineyard 
 On the 23 of July I startedfor St Louis to purchase a stockof paper for the "Times & Seasons"and arrived at St Louis onthe 2nd of August after a veryuncomfortable voyage duringwhich I took a very severecold which settled into biliousfever.See book marks 3 
 March 1, 1840 was my birth day I being 33years of age. It being on Sunday I preachedtwice through the day to a large assembly in theCity Hall in the Town of Hanly and broke breadunto the Saints again in the evening I ^again^ met with alarge assemble of the Saints and strangers and whilesinging the first Hymn the spirit of the Lord rested uponme and the voice of the Lord said to me this is the last meeting that you will hold with this peoplefor many ^days^ I was asstonished at this as I had manyappointments out in that district, when I arose tospeak to the people I told them that it was thelast meeting I should hold with them for many daysthey were as much asstonished as I was In theat the close of the meeting several four came forwardfor baptism and we went down into the watter & baptized them. In the morning I went in secretbefore the Lord and asked him what his will wasconcerning me and the ownly answer I got was togo to the South for the Lord had a great work forme to perform there as many souls were there waitingfor the word of the Lord 
 Chapter 6. My journey to Herefordshire. Interviewedwith John Benbow. The word of the Lord fulfilledto me. The greatest gathering into the Church known among theGentiles since the organization of the Church in thisdespensationOn the 3rd of March 1840 in fulfillment of the wordof the Lord to me I took coach & rode to Wolverham-pton 26 miles & spent the night on the morning of the4 I again took coach & rode through Dudley Stourbridge, Kideministon, Stourport, andWorcester and then walked a number of miles toMr John Benbows, Hill Farme, Castle Froome,Ledbury Hereforshire Mr Benbow this was inthe South of England a farming country, a regionwhere No Morm Elder of the Latter Day Saints hadvisited, I found Mr Benbow a wealthy farmer cultivating300 acres of land, occupying a good mansion and a plentyof means. His wife Jane had no children, I presented my-self to them as a missionary from America an Elderof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had beensent to him by the commandment of God as a messengerof Salvation to preach the Gospel of Life & Salvation 
 unto him and his houshold and the Inhabitants ofthe land. Mr Benbow & his wife wife received me withglad hearts and thanksgiving, it was in the evening whenI arrived having traveled during the day 48 mils by coach &on foot, but after receiving refreshments we sat downtogether & conversed untill two oclock in the morning, Br& Sister Benbow rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings ofgreat joy which I brought unto them of the fullnessof the Everlasting Gospel which God had revealed throughthe mouth of his prophet Joseph Smith in theselast days, and I rejoiced greatly at the joyful newsthat BMr Benbow gave me, that I was standing in themidst of a company of men & women over 600 inNumber who had broaken of[f] from the WesleyanMethodist and taken the name of United BrethrenHad 45 preachers as ^among^ their number, had Chapels &many Homes licensed according theto the Law of the landfor preaching in, and this Body of United Brethren were searching for light and truth but had gone as faras they could, and were earnistly ^earnestly^ calling upon theLord to open the way before them, and send themlight and knowledge that they might know the true 
 way to be saved, when I learned these things I couldclearly see why the Lord had commanded me whilein the town of Hanly to leave that field of laborand go to the South, for I could could clearlysee in Herefordshire a great harvest field forgathering many saints into the Kingdom of God, I retiredto my bed with joy & rejoicing after offering my prayer& thanksgiving to God, & slept sweetly until therising of the Sun; I arose in the morning of the 5th took breakfastand told Mr Benbow I would like to commence myMasters business by preaching the Gospel to the peopleHe had a large hall in his mansion which was licensedfor preaching, and he sent word through the Neighborhoodthat an American Missionary would preach at his homethat evening, the time came, many of the Neighbors came in& I preached my first Gospel sermon in ^his home^ the home. I alsopreached on the following evening March 6, at his homeand baptized 6 persons including Mr John Benbow& wife 4 of four of the six were preachers of the UnitedOrder ^Brethren^, I spent most of the following day in cleancleaning out a nice pool of water and prepared itfor baptizing in as I saw many were to be baptized 
 there. ^I afterwards baptized 600 in this pool of water^ On Sunday the 8, I preached at Frooms Hillin the morning, at Standly Hill in the afternoonand at John Benbows Hill farm in the evening. It wasa remarkable incident that the parrish Church thatstood in the Neiborhood of Br Benbow and occupiedby the rector of the parrish had but 15 personsattended his Church during the day while I had a largecongregation judged to be a thousand attended mymeetings through the day & evening, and as I arose inthe evening to speak at John Benbows house a manentered the door and approached me and informed mehe was a constable sent by the rector of the parrishwith a warrant to arest me I asked him for whatcrime, he said for preaching to the people, I told himI had a license for the preaching ^of^ the Gospel to the peopleas well as the rector, and if he would take a chairI would wait upon him after meeting, he took mychair & sat beside of me, I preached the firstprinciples of the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel foran hour & a quarter the power of God rested upon methe spirit of God filled the home the people were convincedat the close of the meeting I opened a door for 
 baptism seven offered themselves, 4four were preachers, among the number ^offered^ offered for baptism was the constable. He arose &said Mr Woodruff I would like to be baptized, I told him I would like to to baptize him, I went down to the pool & baptized the seven we then met together and I confirmed thirteen, & broak bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced together. The constable wentto the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr Woodruff taken up for preaching the Gospel he must go himself and serve the writ, for he had ^heard^ her him preach the ownly true gospel sermon he had ever heard in his life. The rector did not know what to make of it, and he sent two clerks of the Church of England ads ^as^ spies to attend our meeting to see what we did preach but they were both pricked in their hearts, and received the word of God gladly & were baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the rector became alarmed & dare not send any body ^els^ but the Ministers & rectors of the Church of Englandof the South of England called a convention and sent a petition to the Lord Bishop of Canterbury to petitionparliment to pass a Law to prohibit the Mormons 
 [page covered] [fr]om preaching in the British dominions in this [p]etition the rector stated that one MormonAmerican Missionary [had] baptized fifteen hundred mostly members of the English Church during the last seven months, but the Lord Bishop & Council understanding very well, that the laws of England gave free toleration to all religions under the British flag sent word to the petitioners that if they [loved] the worth of souls at least as much as they did the ground where hares foxes & hounds run they would not loose as many of their flock. I continued to preach and baptize daily. On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder Thomas Kington. He was the superintendant of both preachers & members of the United Brethren, the first thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire I had baptized forty five preachers, & 160 members of the United Brethrenwhich put into my hands one Chapel & 45 homes licensed according to law to preach in, this opened a wide field for labor, this enabled me to bring into the Church through the blessings of God over eighteen hundred souls during eight month labor including all of the 600 united Brethren exept one persons it also included 
 some two hundred preachers of the various denominations This field of labor embraced Herefordshire Glostershire & Worstershire and formed these Conferences Garway ^Garway^, Gadfield Elm & Frooms Hill, I was visited by president ^young^ & Dr Richards, Brother Benbow furnished  us with £300, to print the first Book of Mormon that we published in England and on the 20 day of May 1840 B Young, W Woodruff & W Richards held a council on the top of Malv Malvern Hill, and there decidedthat president Young go dirct ^direct^ to Manchester & publish 3000 copies of the Hymn Book, & 3000 copies of the Book of Mormon this being the first of the publishing of these Books in England. The power of God rested upon us upon this Mission, the sick were healed, Devils were cast out, the lame was made to walk one notible case I will mention MaryPitt who died in Nauvoo sister to Wm Pitt who died in Salt Lake City she had not walked upon her feet for eleven years we carr[i]ed her unto the water where I baptized her. On the evening of the 18 May 1840 at Br Kingtons house in Ledbury 
 Dymock Elders B. Young, W Richards & W Woodruff laid hands upon her head & confirmed her, BrYoung being mouth and rebuked her lameness& commanded her to rise & walk in the Name of the Lord and she was made whole and never used a staff or cruch to the day of her death she walked through the town of Dymock next day which created a stir among the people but the wicked did not feel to give God the glory. The whole History of this Herefordshire Mission shows us the importance of carefully ^listening^ listeninig to the still small voice of the spirit of God, to listen ^to^ the revelations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord had a people there prepared for the Gospel, they were praying for light & truth, the Lord sent me to them I declared the Gospel of Life and Salvation unto them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it and many of them have been gathered to Zion in theseMountains and many of them have been called to officiate in the Bishoppric Bishopricks 
 and done much good in Zion, but for all these things we should ever acknowledgethe Hand of God therein and give him the honor praise & glory forever & ever Amen

He wanted to see if I could preach.I must confess that by this time I be-came a little mischievous, and pleadedwith him not to set me preaching.The more I plead to be excused, the more determined Mr. Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and the landlady got me a good supper.I sat down in a large hall to eat sup-per. Before I got through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich and fashionable of Memphis, dressed in their broadcloth and silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after traveling through the mud as I had been.When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the corner of the room, with a stand having a Bible, hymn book and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with thelandlord in the centre.There were present some five hundred persons who had come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some fun.I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would sing a word.I told them I had not the gift of sing-ing; but with the help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His Spirit and to show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord in my prayer I would deliver to that congregation whatever He would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half and it was one of the best sermons of my life.The lives of the congregation were open to the vision of my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed I was the only person in the room.Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room adjoining a large one in which were assembled many of the men whom I had[Column 2]been preaching to. I could hear their conversation.One man said he would like to know how that Mormon boy knew of their past lives.In a little while they got to disputing about some doctrinal point. One sug-gested calling me to decide the point. The landlord said, "no; we have had enough for once.''In the morning, I had a good break-fast. The landlord said if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long as I might choose.After leaving Memphis, I traveled through the country to Benton County, and preached on the way as I had oppor-tunity.I stopped one night with a Squire Hardman, an Episcopalian.Most of the night was spent by the family in music and dancing.In the morning, at the breakfast table, Mr. Hardman asked me if we believed in music and dancing.I told him we did not really consider them essential to salvation.He said he did, and therefore should not join our Church.On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the happy privilege of meeting Elder War-ren Parrish at the house of Brother Frys. He had been preaching in that part of Tennessee, in company with David W. Patten, and had baptized a number and organized several small branches.Brother Patten had returned home, and Brother Parrish was laboring alone. I joined him in the ministry, and we labored together three months and nine-teen days, when he was called to Kirt-land.During the time we were together we traveled through several counties in Ten-nessee for the distance of seven hundred and sixty miles, and preached the gospel daily, as we had opportunity. We bap-tized some twenty persons.By the counsel of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder, and left me to take charge of the branches that had been raised up in that neighborhood.As soon as I was left alone I extended my circuit and labors. For a season I had large congregations; many seemed to believe and I baptized a number.On the 15th of August I had an ap- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]pointment at the house of Brother Tay-lor, the step-father of Abraham O. Smoot.I had to cross Bloody River, which I had to swim in, in consequence of heavy rains. While crossing, my horse became entangled in a tree-top, and almost drowned; but I succeeded in getting him loose.We swam to the shore separately. He reached the shore first, and waited till I came out. I got into the saddle, and went on my way in good spirits, and had a good meeting.On the 20th of October I baptized three Campbellites, one of whom was a deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr. Greenwood's, who was eighty years old, and had been a soldier under General Washington. His wife, who was ninety-three years old, I found quite smart, and busy carding wool. I preached at their house and baptized both of them.On the following day I preached at the house of Benjamin L. Clapp, and bap-tized seven Campbellites and one Bap-tist.On the 16th of November, I preached at Brother Camp's, and baptized three. On the day following, it being Sunday, I preached again at Brother Clapp's, and baptized five. At the close of the meet-ing I mounted my horse to ride to Clark's River, in company with Seth Utley, four other brethren and two sis-ters. The distance was twenty miles.We came to a stream, which was so swollen by rains, that we could not cross without swimming our horses. To swim would not be safe for the females, so we went up the stream to find a ford. In the attempt we were overtaken by a se-vere storm of wind and rain, and lost our way in the darkness, and wandered through creeks and mud. But the Lord does not forsake his Saints in any of their troubles. While we were in the woods suffering under the blast of the storm, groping like the blind for the wall, a bright light suddenly shone around us, and revealed to us our dan-gerous situation on the edge of a gulf. The light continued with us until we found the road; we then went on our way rejoicing, though the darkness re-turned and the rain continued.We reached Brother Henry Thomas' in safety about nine o'clock at night,[Column 2]having been five hours in the storm and forded streams many times. None of us felt to complain, but were thankful to God for His preserving care.On the following day I preached in Damon Creek, and organized a branch called the Damon Creek Branch, and ordained Daniel Thomas a teacher.On the 19th of December I again preached at the house of Brother Clapp, and baptized five persons; one was a Campbellite preacher.On the following day I preached at the house of Brother Henry Thomas, when a mob of about fifty persons ccl-lected, headed by a Baptist preacher, who, after asking one question, advised the mob not to lay hands on any man on account of his principles. The advice was good and well taken.At the close of the meeting I baptized three persons, one seventy-eight years old.This brings the year 1835 to a close— the first year of my mission—during which time I had traveled three thousand two hundred and forty-eight miles, held one hundred and seventy meetings, bap-tized forty-three persons—three of whom were Campbellite preachers—assisted Elder Parrish to baptize twenty more, confirmed thirty-five, organized three branches, ordained two teachers and one deacon, procured thirty subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate, one hun-dred and seventy-three signers to the petition to the governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done the Saints in Jackson County, had three mobs rise against me—but was not harmed—wrote eighteen letters, received ten, and, finally, closed the labors of the year 1835, by eating johnny-cake, butter and honey, at brother A. O. Smoot's.I spent the fore part of January, 1836, (the weather being very cold) at the house of A. O. Smoot, in Kentucky, studying Kirkham's English Grammar.I continued to travel and preach in Ken-tucky and Tennessee and baptized all that would believe my testimony.On the 26th of February we held a conference at the house of Brother Lewis Clapp (father of B. L. Clapp). There were represented one hundred and three members in that mission. I ordained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyston elders, and Daniel Thomas and Benja- 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]min L. Clapp priests. I also ordained one teacher and two deacons.After conference I took Brothers Smoot and Clapp with me to preach. The former traveled with me constantly till the 21st of April, when we had theprivilege of meeting with Elder David W. Patten, who had come direct from Kirtland, and who had been ordained one of the Twelve Apostles.It was a happy meeting. He gave us an account of the endowments at Kirt-land, the glorious blessings received, the ministration of angels, the organization of the Twelve Apostles and Seventies, and informed me that I was appointed a member of the second quorum of Seventies. All of this was glorious news to me, and caused my heart to rejoice.On the 27th of May we were joined by Elder Warren Parrish, direct from Kirtland. We had a happy time to-gether.On the 28th, we held a conference at Brother Seth Utley's, where were repre-sented all the branches of the Church in the South.I was ordained on the 31st of May a member of the second quorum of Seven-ties under the hands of David W. Patten and Warren Parrish.At the close of the conference we separated for a short time. Elders Pat-ten and Parrish labored in Tennessee, Brother Smoot and myself in Kentucky. On the 9th of June we all met at Damon Creek Branch, where Brother Patten baptized two. One was Father Henry Thomas, who had been a revolutionarysoldier under General Washington. and father of Daniel and Henry Thomas.A warrant was issued, on the oath of a priest, against D. W. Patten, W. Par-rish and myself. We were accused in the warrant of the great "crime" of testifying that Christ would come in this generation, and that we promised the Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized. Brothers Patten and Parrish were taken on the 19th of June. I, being in another county, escaped being arrested. The brethren were put under two thousand dollars bonds to appear at court. Albert Petty and Seth Utley were their bonds-men.They were tried on the 22nd of June. They pleaded their own cause. Although men came forward and testified they did[Column 2]receive the Holy Ghost after they were baptized, the brethren were condemned; but were finally released by paying the expenses of the mob court.There was one peculiar circumstance connected with this trial by a mob court, which was armed to the teeth. When the trial was through with, the people were not willing to permit more than one to speak. Warren Parrish had said but few words, and they were not willing to let David Patten speak. But he, feeling the injustice of the court, and being filled with the power of God, arose to his feet and delivered a speech of about twenty minutes, holding them spell-bound while he told them of their wickedness and the abominations that they were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited them, if they did not repent, for taking up two harmless, in-offensive men for preaching the gospel of Christ.When he had got through his speech the judge said, "You must be armed with secret weapons, or you would not talk in this fearless manner to an armed court."Brother Patten replied; "I have weapons that you know not of, and they are given me of God, for He gives me all the power I have."The judge seemed willing to get rid of them almost upon any terms, and offered to dismiss them if their friends would pay the costs, which the brethren pres-ent freely offered to do.When the two were released, they mounted their horses and rode a mile to Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had left, the court became ashamed that they had been let go so easily and the whole mob mounted their horses to follow themto Utley's.One of the Saints, seeing the state of affairs, went on before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they had time to ride into the woods near by.They traveled along about three miles to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to bed. The night was dark, and they fell asleep.But Brother Patten was warned in a dream to get up and flee, as the mob would soon be there. They both arose, saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining county.The house they had just left was soon 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]surrounded by the mob, but the brethren had escaped through the mercy of God.I was invited to hold a meeting at a Baptist meeting house on the 27th of June. On my arrival I met a large con-gregation; but, on commencing meeting, Parson Browning ordered the meeting to be closed. I told the people I had come ten miles to preach the gospel to them, and was willing to stand in a cart, on a pile of wood, on a fence, or any other place they would appoint, to have that privilege.One man said he owned the fence and land in front of the meeting house, and we might use both, for he did not be-lieve Mormonism would hurt either.So the congregation crossed the road, took down the fence and made seats of it, and I preached to them one hour and a half. At the close Mr. Randolph Alexander bore testimony to the truth of what had been said. He invited me home with him, bought a Book of Mor-mon, and was baptized, and I organizeda branch in that place.On the 18th of July, Brother A. O. Smoot and I arrived at a ferry on the Tennessee River, and, as the ferryman was not at home, the woman kindly gave us permission to use the ferryboat. We led our horses on board, and took the oars to cross the river. Brother Smoot had never used an oar, and I had not for some years, so we made awkward work of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let another fall overboard, which left us only one broken oar to get to shore with. We narrowly escaped running into a steamboat. We struck shore half a mile below the landing place, tied up the boat, jumped on the bank with our horses, and went on our way with blis-tered hands, thankful to get off so well.On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O.Smoot and I preached at Mr. David Crider's, Weakly County, Tennessee. After the meeting Mr. Crider was bap-tized. A mob gathered and threatened us, and poisoned our horses so that the one I rode, belonging to Samuel West, died a few days after. This horse had carried me thousands of miles while preaching the gospel.I continued to travel with Brothers Smoot, Patten and Parrish in Tennessee and Kentucky, and we baptized all who would receive our testimony.[Column 2]On the 2nd day of September we held a general conference at the Damon Creek Branch. Elder Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Twelve Apostles, pre-sided. All the branches in Tennessee and Kentucky were represented.Brothers Randolph Alexander, Benja-min L. Clapp and Johnson F. Lane were ordained elders and Lindsay Bradey was ordained to the lesser priesthood.I assisted President Marsh to obtain .fifteen hundred dollars from the Southern brethren, to enter land in Missouri for the Church. The brethren made me a present of fifty dollars, which I sent by President Marsh to enter forty acres of land for me. Elder Smoot and I were released from the Southern mission with permission to go to Kirtland.Having returned from my Southern mission in the autumn of 1836, in com-pany with Elders A. O. Smoot and Jesse Turpin, I spent the following winter in Kirtland. During this time I received my endowments and attended the school of Professsor Haws, who taught Greek, Latin and English grammar. I confined my studies mostly to Latin and English grammar.This winter and the following spring, in some respects, may be regarded as one of the most interesting periods of the history of the Church, when we con-sider the endowments and teachings given in the temple, and the great apos-tasy which followed.I was married to Miss Phoebe Whit-more Carter, on the 13th of April, 1837, and received my patriarchal blessing under the hands of Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch, two days later.I felt impressed by the Spirit of God to take a mission to the Fox Islands, sit-uated east of the Maine shore, a country I knew nothing about. I made my feel-ings known to the Apostles, and they advised me to go.Feeling that it was my duty to go upon this mission, I did not tarry at home one year after having married a wife, as the law of Moses would have allowed. On the contrary, I started just one month and one day after that important event, leaving my wife with Sister Hale, with whom she expected to stay for a season.I left Kirtland in good spirits, in com-pany with Elder Jonathan H. Hale, and walked twelve miles to Fairport, where 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]we were joined by Elder Milton Holmes. There we went aboard the steamer San-dusky, and made our way to Buffalo, and proceeded thence to Syracuse, by way of the Erie Canal. We then walked to Richland, Oswego County, New York, where I met my two brothers, whom I had not seen for several years.After spending one night there, we continued our journey to Sackett's Har-bor, and crossed Lake Ontario on the steamer Oneida, to Kingston, Upper Canada, and from there also by steamer along the canal to Jones' Falls, whence we walked to a place called Bastard, Leeds County.Here we found a branch of the Church, presided over by John E. Page and James Blakesly. We accompanied them to their place of meeting, and attended a conference with them, at which three hundred members of the Church were represented.Thirty-two persons presented them-selves for ordination, whom I was re-quested to ordain, in company with Elder William Draper. We ordained seven elders, nine priests, eleven teachers and five deacons.We spoke to the people several times during this conference, and at its close we were called upon to administer to a woman who was possessed of the devil. At times she was dumb, and greatly afflicted with the evil spirits that dwelt in her. She believed in Jesus and in us as His servants, and wished us to adminis-ter to her. Four of us laid our hands upon her head and commanded the devil, in the name of Jesus Christ, to depart out of her. It was immediately done, and the woman arose with great joy, and gave thanks and praise unto God; for, according to her faith, she was made whole from that hour.A child, also, that was sick, was healed by the laying on of hands, ac-cording to the word of God.We walked thirty miles to visit another branch of the Saints at Leeds, where we met with John Gordon and John Snider. Here we held a meeting and bore our testimony to the people.A Sister Carns here came to us and requested to have the ordinance for the healing of the sick performed for two of her children who were afflicted. One was a suckling child, which was lying at[Column 2]the point of death. I took it in my arms and presented it before the elders, who laid their hands upon it, and it was made whole immediately, and I handed it back to the mother entirely healed.We afterwards laid hands upon the other, when it was also healed. It was done by the power of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, and the parents praised God for His goodness.After leaving the Saints in this place, we returned to Kingston, and crossed Lake Ontario in company with Isaac Russel, John Goodson and John Snider.Brother Russell seemed to be con-stantly troubled with evil spirits, which followed him when he subsequently went on a mission to England, where Apostles Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball, when administering to him, had a severe contest with them, as Brother Kimball has related in his history.Brothers Russell, Goodson and Snider continued with us to Schenectady, where they left us to proceed to New York, to join Elders Kimball and Hyde to go upon their mission to England.After leaving these brethren we traveled by rail to Albany, and walked from there to Canaan, Connecticut, where we found a branch of the Church, including Jesse and Julian Moses and Francis K. Bene-dict.We held a two-days' meeting with the Saints in Canaan, and I ordained Julian Moses and Francis K. Benedict elders.After holding several meetings in the town of Colebrook, and visiting my half sister, Eunice Woodruff, who taught school there, I proceeded to Avon, the place of my birth. There I visited many of my former neighbors and rela-tives, and the grave of my mother, Beulah Woodruff, who died June 11th, 1808, when twenty-six years of age. The fol-lowing verse was upon her tombstone:A pleasing form, a generous heart, A good companion, just without art; Just in her dealings, faithful to her friend, Beloved through life, lamented in the end.At the close of the day I walked six miles to Farmington, where my father, Aphek Woodruff, was living, and I had the happy privilege of once more meet-ing with him and my step-mother, whom I had not seen for seven years. They greeted me with great kindness, and it was a happy meeting. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]After visiting with my father a day or two, I returned to Avon, where most of my relatives lived, and held meetings with them, and on the 12th of June, 1837, I baptized my uncle, Ozem Wood-ruff, his wife Hannah, and his son John, and we rejoiced together, for this was in fulfillment of a dream I had in 1818, when I was eleven years of age.On the 15th of July I had an appoint-ment to preach at the house of my uncle, Adna Hart. While there I had the happy privilege of meeting with my wife,Phoebe W. Woodruff, who had come from Kirtland to meet me and accom-pany me to her father's home in Scar-boro, Maine.Those who had assembled to hear me preach were relatives, neighbors and for-mer friends. After meeting, we returned to Farmington to my father's home, where I spent the night with my father, step-mother, sister and wife. Elder Hale was also with us.On the 19th of July, Elder Hale left us to go to his friends in New Rowley, Massachusetts, and on the same evening ing house in the town of Farmington. I had a large congregation of citizens, with whom I had been acquainted from my youth. My parents, wife and sister attended the meeting. The congrega-tion seemed satisfied with the doctrines I taught, and they requested me to hold another meeting; but I felt anxious to continue my journey, and on the 20th of July I parted from my father, step-mother and sister, and took stage for Hartford with my wife.On my arrival at Hartford, not having money to pay the fare of both of us, I paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Massa-chusetts, where there was a branch of the Church, presided over by Brother Nathaniel Holmes, father of Jonathan and Milton Holmes, and I journeyed on foot.The first day I walked fifty-two miles, the second day forty-eight, and the third day thirty-six miles, and arrived at Row-ley at two o'clock, making one hundred and thirty-six miles in a little over two and a half days.I spent eight days at New Rowley, holding meetings and visiting the Saints, including the Holmes family, and left there on the 1st of August.[Column 2]On the 8th of August, in company with my wife and Elder Hale, I visited my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his family in Scarboro, Maine, it being the first time I had ever seen any of her relatives. We were very kindly received. My wife had been absent from her father's home about one year.I spent eight days with Father Carter and household, and one day I went out to sea with Fabian and Ezra Carter, my brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with hooks. We caught two hundred and fifty cod, haddock and hake, and we saw four whales, two at a time, it being the first time in my life I had ever seen the kind of a fish which is said to have swallowed Jonah.On the 18th of August, 1837, 1 parted with my wife and her father's household, leaving her with them, and, in company with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the mission that I had in view when I left Kirtland.We walked ten miles to Portland, and took passage on the steamboat Bangor, which carried us to Owl's Head, where we went on board of a sloop which landed us on North Fox Island at 2 o'clock, A.M., on the 20th.The town of Vinal Haven includes both North and South Fox Islands, in latitude 44° north, and longitude 69° 10' west. The population numbered, at the time of my visit, about 1,800. The in-habitants were intelligent and indus-trious, and hospitable to strangers. They got most of their wealth and living by fishing. The town fitted out over one hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides smaller craft.North Fox Island is nine miles long by two miles in width and had a popula-tion of 800. They had a post office, one store, a Baptist church and meeting house, four school houses and a tide grist mill.The land was rather poor, yet there were some good farms. The products were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes and grass. The principal timber was fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. Raspberries and gooseberries grew in great abun-dance, and some up-land cranberries were raised. The principal stock of the island were sheep.South Fox Island comes as near being without any definite form as any spot on 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]earth I ever saw. It would be difficult for any person to describe it. It is about ten miles in length by five in width, and is one universal mass of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut up into necks and points to make room for the coves and harbors that run through and through the island.The population was 1,000. The in-habitants got their living entirely by fishing. There is no chance for farming upon the island, and but a few garden patches, which are cultivated at great expense. Some few sheep are raised there.Many of the inhabitants fish in the region of Newfoundland, and bring their fish home and cure them on flakes and prepare them for the market. They supply the market with great quantities of cod, mackerel and boxed herring.Upon this island there were two stores,three tide saw mills, six school houses and a small branch of the Methodist church, presided over by a priest.What timber there is upon this island,such as pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and birch, and the whortleberries, raspberriesand gooseberries, mostly grow out of the cracks of the rocks.Great quantities of fish, and in almost endless variety, inhabit the coves and harbors around the islands. The whale, blackfish, shark, ground shark, pilot-fish, horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, hali-but, cod, polleck, tom cod, hake, had-dock, mackerel, shad bass, alewife,herring, pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost-fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, skid, cusk, blueback, scollop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five-fingers, monkfish, horsefish, sunfish, swordfish, thrasher, cat, scuppog, tootog, eyefish, cunner, ling, also the eel, lobster, clam, muscle, periwinkle, porpoise, seal, etc., are found there.Thus I have given a brief descriptionof Vinal Haven. It was quite dark when we landed there, without a farthingin money. We made our way over the rocks and through the cedars the best way we could, until we found a house, when we rapped at the door. A womanput her head out of the window and asked who was there and what was wanted.I told her we were two strangers, and wanted a bed to lie down upon until morning.[Column 2]She let us in and gave us a bed, and we slept until quite late, it being Sunday morning. When we came out and took breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked her what she charged for our entertain-ment, and she replied that we were wel-come.I then asked her if there was any religion or minister or church on the island.She informed me there was a Baptist minister, by the name of Newton, who had a congregation and meeting house about five miles from there.We thanked her for her kindness, walked to the meeting house and stepped inside the doorway. We stood there until a deacon came to the door, when I asked him to go and tell the minister in the pulpit that there were two servants of God at the door, who had a messageto deliver to that people and wished the privilege of delivering it.He sent for us to come to the pulpit, so we walked through the congregation with our valises under our arms, and took a seat by the side of the minister, who was about to speak as we came to the door.He arose and delivered his discourse to the people, occupying about half an hour. When he closed he asked me what was my wish.1 told him we wished to speak to the people at any hour that would suit his or their convenience; so he gave notice that there were two strangers presentwho would speak to the people at fiveo'clock that evening.We were quite a source of wonder-ment to the people, as they had no idea who we were.Mr. Newton asked us home to tea with him, and we gladly accepted the invitation. When we arrived at his house I opened my valise and took out the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doc-trine and Covenants, laid them upon the table, and took my seat.Mr. Newton took up the books and looked at them, but said nothing. I then asked him if there were any school houses upon the island. and if so, whether they were free to preach in. He answered that there were four, num-bered respectively from one to four, and that they were free.Mr. Newton and family accompanied 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]us to the meeting-house, where we met a large congregation, none of whom knew who we were, or anything about our profession, except the minister.Elder Hale and I went to the stand, and I arose with peculiar feelings and addressed the congregation for one hour, taking for my text ##Galatians 1:8-9|Galatians i. 8–9.##This was the first time that I or any other elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had (to my knowledge) attempted to preach the the fullness of the gospel and the Bookof Mormon to the inhabitants of any island of the sea.I had much liberty in speaking, and informed the people that the Lord had raised up a prophet and organized His Church as in the days of Christ and the ancient apostles, with prophets, apostles, and the gifts as anciently, and that He had brought forth the Book of Mormon.At the close of my remarks Elder Hale bore testimony.I gave liberty for any one to speak that might wish to. As no one re-sponded, I announced that we would hold meetings the next four evenings at the school-houses, beginning at No. I.During the first thirteen days of our sojourn upon the island we preached seventeen discourses, being invited by the people to tarry with them. I left a copy of the Doctrine and Covenants with Mr. Newton for his perusal.He read it, and the Spirit of God bore testimony to him of its truth. He pondered over it for days, and he walked his room until midnight trying to decide whether to receive or reject it. He and his family attended about a dozen of my first meetings, and then he made up his mind, contrary to the dictation of the Spirit ol God to him, to reject the testi-mony and come out against me. How-ever, we commenced baptizing his flock.The first two we baptized were a sea captain, by the name of Justin Eames, and his wife. Brother Jonathan H. Hale went down into the sea and bap-tized them on the 3rd of September, and these were the first baptisms performed by proper authority upon any of the islands of the sea (to my knowledge) in this dispensation.Before we left Kirtland some of the leading apostates there had tried to dis-courage Brother Hale about going on his[Column 2]mission, telling him he would never bap-tize any one, and he had better remain at home. When Captain Eames offered himself for baptism, I told Brother Hale to go and baptize him, and prove those men false prophets, and he did so.On the following Sabbath I baptized his brother, Ebenezer Eames, another sea captain, and a young lady.Mr. Newton, the Baptist minister, now commenced a war against us, and sent to the South Island for a Mr. Douglas, a Methodist minister (with whom he had been at variance for years) to come over and help him put down "Mormonism."Mr. Douglas came over, and they got as many people together as they could and held a conference. He railed againstJoseph, the prophet, and the Book of Mormon, and, taking that book in his hand, with out-stretched arm, declared that he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon him for re-jecting it as the word of God, (I never heard what his sentiments upon this sub-ject were at the end of his term of fourteen years' imprisonment in the Thomaston Penitentiary, for an outrage upon his daughter, the judgment of which was given upon the testimony of his wife and daughter.)I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' speech upon this occasion, and took minutes of the same. When he closed I arose and informed the people that I would meet with them next Sunday in the meeting-house, and answer Mr. Douglass, and wished him, as well as the people to be present.I informed the people that Mr. Doug-lass had made many false statements against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saints, with whom he had no acquain-tance, and he had misquoted much Scrip-ture, all of which I could correct.We continued to baptize the people on the North Island until we baptized every person who owned an interest in the Baptist meeting-house. I then followed Mr. Douglass home to the South Island, and preached the gospel to and baptized nearly all the members of his church.The excitement became great on both islands, and on Sunday, the 17th of September, I met a large assembly from both islands, and took the same subject that Mr. Douglass had dwelt upon in his 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE[Column 1]remarks against the Book of Mormon and our principles.I spoke two and a half hours, and an-swered every objection against the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, or our prin-ciples.I had good attention and the people seemed satisfied. At the close of the meeting Elder Hale administered the ordinance of baptism.Mr. Newton, in order to save his cause, went to the mainland and brought over several ministers with him and held a protracted meeting. They hoped by this to stop the work of God, but all to no avail, for the whole people would attend our meeting and receive the word of God, and we continued to baptize.We visited the dwellings of most of inhabitants during our sojourn there.Upon one occasion, while standing upon Mr. Carver's farm, on the east end of the North Island, we counted fifty-five islands in that region, the majority of which were not inhabited. We also saw twenty ships under sail at the same time.We had no lack for food while upon the island, for if we did not wish to trouble our friends for a dinner, we only had to borrow a spade or a hoe, and a kettle and go to the beach and dig a peck of clams. These, when boiled, would make a delicious meal, which we often availed ourselves of.One day Elder Hale and I ascended to the top of a high granite rock on the South Island, for prayer and sup-plication. We sat down under the shadeof a pine tree which grew out of a fis-sure in the rock, and Elder Hale read the ##Jeremiah 16:16|sixteenth chapter## of Jeremiah, where mention is made of the hunters and fishers that God would send in the last days to gather Israel.Of a truth here we were upon an island of the sea, standing upon a rock where we could survey the gallant ships and also the islands, which were as full of rocks, ledges, and caves as any part of the earth. And what had brought us here? To search out the blood of Ephraim,the honest and meek of the earth, and gather them from those islands, rocks, holes, and caves of the earth unto Zion.We prayed, and rejoiced together. The Spirit of God rested upon us; we spoke of Christ and the ancient prophets[Column 2]and apostles in Jerusalem; of Nephi, Alma, Mormon, and Moroni in America; Joseph, Hyrum, Oliver, and the apostles in our own day, and we rejoiced that we were upon the islands of the sea search-ing out the blood of Israel.While being filled with these medita-tions and the Spirit of God, we fell upon our knees and gave thanks to the God of heaven, and felt to pray forall Israel.After spending most of the day in praise and thanksgiving, we descended to the settlement and held a meeting with the people.On the 6th of September we called upon Captain Benjamin Coombs, and visited his flakes, where he had onethousand quintals of codfish drying for the market. They had mostly been caught in the region of Newfoundland. While we were passing Carvey's Wharf our attention was called to a large school of mackerel playing by the side of the wharf. Several men were pitching them out with hooks. We also flung in a hook and caught all we wanted, then went on our way.We continued to labor, preaching and baptizing, and organized a branch of the Church upon each island, and, finally, on the second of October, we parted with the Saints on the North Island to return to Scarboro for a short time.We walked from Thomaston to Bath, a distance of forty-six miles, in one day, and at the latter place attended a Bap-tist convention. I also preached there to a large congregation in the evening, and the people gave good attention and wished to learn more about our doc-trines.On the following day we walked thirty-six miles to Portland, and the next day to Scarboro. Here I again met with my wife and her father's family.The time had come for me to give the parting hand to Brother Jonathan H. Hale. We had traveled during the sea-son over two thousand miles together, with our hearts and spirits well united.He felt it his duty to return to his family at Kirtland, but duty called me to return to my field of labor upon the islands.On the 9th of October I accompanied Brother Hale one mile upon his journey. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]We retired to a grove and knelt down and prayed together, and had a good time, and, after commending each other to God, we parted, he to return to Kirt-land and I to Fox Islands.I spent fourteen days visiting the Saints and friends, and holding meetings among them, and on the 28th of Octo-ber I took leave of Father Carter and and family, and in company with my wife rode to Portland, and spent the night with my brother-in-law, Ezra Carter.A severe storm arose, so we could not go to sea until November 1st, when we took steamer to Owl's Head, carriage to Thomaston and sloop to Fox Islands.My second visit to these islands was made under very different circumstances to the first. On my first visit I was an entire stranger to the people, and they were strangers to the gospel, but upon my second I met many Saints who had received the gospel, and who hailed me, and my companion also, with glad hearts.On Sunday, the 5th of November, I met with a large assembly of Saints and friends, and again commenced baptizingsuch as would receive my testimony.After visiting the North Island and holding meetings with the Saints there,and baptizing two after meeting, I em-barked on board a sloop, with Captain Coombs, for another island called the Isle of Holt. We arrived at noon, and I preached to the people at night in their school house, and had an attentive audience. I spent the night with John Turner, Esq., who purchased a copy of the Book of Mormon.On the following day we returned to Fox Islands, and as St. Paul once had to row hard to make the land in a storm, we had to row hard to make it in a calm.After preaching on the North Island again and baptizing two persons at the close of the meeting, I returned again to the mainland in company with Mrs. Woodruff and others, where I spent fif-teen days, during which time I visited among the people, held twelve meetings and baptized several persons.On the 13th of December I returned again to the North Island, where I held several meetings, and then crossed over to the South Island.[Column 2]On the 20th of December I spent an hour with Mr. Isaac Crockett in clearing away large blocks of ice from the water in a cove, in order to baptize him, whichI did when the tide came in. I alsobaptized two more in the same place on the 26th, and again two others on the27th.On the 28th I held a meeting at a school house, when William Douglass,the Methodist minister, came and wanted me to work a miracle, that he might be-lieve, and otherwise railed against me.I told him what class of men asked for signs, and that he was a wicked and adulterous man, and predicted that the curse of God would rest upon him, and that his wickedness would be made mani-fest in the eyes of the people. (While visiting these Islands several years after-wards I learned that the prediction had really been fulfilled, and that he was serving out a fourteen years' term of imprisonment for a beastly crime).Mrs. Woodruff crossed the thorough-fare in a boat and walked ten miles, the length of the island, to meet me, on the last day of the year. I held a meetingthe same day in the school house, and at the close of the meeting baptized two persons in the sea, at full tide, before alarge assembly.January 1st, 1838, found me standing upon one of the islands of the sea, a minister of the gospel of life and salva-tion unto the people, laboring alone, though blessed with the society of Mrs. Woodruff, my companion. I had been declaring the word of the Lord through the islands many days, the Spirit of God was working among the people, preju-dice was giving way, and the power of God was manifest by signs following those who believed.I spent this New Year's Day visiting the Saints and their neighbors, and met a congregation at Captain Charles Brown's,where I spoke to them for awhile, and at the close of my remarks led three per-sons down into the sea and baptized them. Two of these were sea captains, namely, Charles Brown, and Jesse Coombs, and the third was the wife of Captain Coombs. After confirming them we spent the evening in preaching, sing-ing and praying.I held meetings almost daily with the Saints up to the 13th, when I crossed to 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]the North Island. Here I found that the seed I had sown was bringing forth fruit. Six persons were ready for bap-tism.But my mission to these islands was not an exception to the general rule: success did not come without many obstacles presenting themselves. Those who rejected the word were frequently inspired by the evil one to make an attempt at persecution.Some of those who felt to oppose me went down to the harbor and got a swivel and small arms, and planted them close by the school house, near the sea shore, and while I was speaking they commenced firing their cannon and guns. I continued speaking in great plainness, but my voice was mingled with the re-port of musketry.I told the people my garments were clear of the blood of the inhabitants of that island, and asked if any wished to embrace the gospel. Two persons came forward and wished to be baptized, and I baptized them.On the following day when I went down to the seaside to baptize a man, the rabble commenced firing guns again, as on the previous night. I afterwards learned that notices were posted up, warning me to leave the town, but I thought it was better to obey God than man, and, therefore, did not go.The next day I baptized three persons, and two days subsequently a couple of others.I had ample evidence of the fact that lying spirits had gone out into the world, for three persons whom I had baptized had been visited by Mr. Douglass, who told them that I denied the Bible and could not be depended upon; and they yielded to his insinuations until the devil took possession of them, and they were in a disaffected condition, and sent for me.When I met them they were in great affliction, but when I instructed them in regard to the principles of the gospel, and administered to them, they were delivered from the evil influence and rejoiced.On the 15th of February I again crossed to the North Island, and after remaining there seven days visiting, we returned to Camden. Here I met Brother James Townsend, who had just arrived from Scarboro.[Column 2]I ordained Brother Townsend to the office of an elder, and we concluded to take a journey to Bangor, and offer the gospel to the inhabitants of that city.We undertook the journey on foot in the dead of winter, when the snow was very deep, and the first day broke the road for seven miles to Scarsmont. The day following, it being Sunday, we held two meetings, preached the gospel to the people, and were kindly entertained.On the evening of the next day we wallowed through snowdrifts for a mile, to meet an appointment to preach in a schoolhouse, and I got one of my ears frozen on the way; but notwithstanding the severity of the weather, we had a large and attentive audience. We also spent the next two days with the people there and held meetings.On the evening of the 21st of Febru-ary, as we came out of the school-house, a light appeared on the northeastern horizon, and spread to the west, and soon rolled over our heads. It had the appearance of fire, blood, and smoke, and at times resembled contending ar-mies. The heavens were illuminated for the space of half an hour. It seemed at times as though the veil was about to rend in twain, and the elements were contend-ing with each other.We looked upon it as one of the signs in the heavens predicted by the prophets of old, as to appear in the last days. We were wading through deep snowdrifts most of the time while witnessing this remarkable scene.The following day we walked fifteen miles through deep snow to Belfast, and, after being refused lodging for the night by eight families, we were kindly enter-tained by a Mr. Thomas Teppley.There was an interesting incident con-nected with our stay at his house. After eating our supper, it being late in the evening. Mr. Teppley placed a stand before me with a Bible upon it, asking me to read a chapter and have prayers with them, he being a religious man.I opened the Bible mechanically, when the ##Matthew 25|25th chapter## of Matthew being the first to catch my eye, I read it, and as I closed the book Mr. Teppley turned to his wife and said, "Is not this a strange thing?" Then he explained to us that he had just read that chapter and closed the book when we rapped at the door, 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]and he felt impressed to say, "Walk in, gentlemen."There is probably no other chapter in the whole book that would have the same influence in causing any one to feed a person who professed to be a servant of God and asked for bread.After becoming acquainted with his circumstances I thought it providential that we were led to his house, for al-though he was a professor of religion and a Methodist, he was in a state of despair, believing that he had committed the un-pardonable sin.However, I told him what the unpar-donable sin was, and that he had not committed it, but that it was a trick of the devil to make him think so, in order to torment him. He then acknowledged that he went down to the wharf a few evenings before, with the intention of drowning himself, but when he looked into the cold, dark water, he desisted and returned home, and had said nothing previous to anyone about it.I taught him the principles of the gospel, which proved a comfort to him. We spent the following day in visiting the people of Belfast, and in the evening preached in a brick school house, pro-vided by Mr. Teppley, and many wished to hear more from us.We next visited Northport and Frank-fort, holding meetings at both places, and on the 1st of March, 1838, we en-tered Bangor, which at that time had a population of ten thousand. This was my birthday, I being thirty-one years of age.I visited some of the leading men of Bangor, and they granted me the use of the City Hall, where I preached to good audiences for two successive evenings. This was the first time a Latter-day Saint Elder had preached in that town. Many were anxious to learn more about our principles, but our visits through all the towns from Thomaston to Bangor were necessarily brief, owing to our ap-pointments upon the Islands. It was like casting our bread upon the waters and trusting in God for the result.On the 5th of March we sailed from Penobscot for the Isle of Holt, where I held a meeting on the following evening.The next day I took passage on the mail boat for the North Island, where I again had the privilege of meeting with[Column 2]the Saints for prayer and praise before the Lord.On my arrival I received a package of letters from friends abroad. One was from Kirtland, and gave an account of the apostasy and tribulations which the Saints were passing through. Joseph the Prophet and others, with their fam-ilies, had gone to Far West, and the Saints were following him.Brother Townsend returned home and I was again left alone in the ministry.On the afternoon of the 22nd of March, Brother Sterrett and I, accompanied by our wives, went several hundred yards from the shore to a sand-bar (it being now low tide), to dig clams. The ground near the shore was much lower than the bar we were on, and while we were all busy digging clams and talking Mormonism, the dashing of the waves of the incoming tide against the shore suddenly made us conscious that we had fifty yards of water between us and the shore.The surf waves also added to our diffi-culty, and as we had no boat, our only alternattve was to cross our four arms, thus forming a kind of arm chair for our wives to sit upon, and carry them in turn to the shore, wading through two and a half feet of water.By the time that we got our wives and clams safely landed, the truth of the old saying was firmly impressed upon our minds, that "Time and tide wait for no man," not even for a preacher of the gospel.On the 28th of March I received a letter from Zion, requesting me to coun-sel the Saints I had baptized to sell their property and gather up to Zion.About this time the Lord was mani-festing himself upon the islands in vari-ous ways, by dreams, visions, healings, signs and wonders. I will relate one peculiar circumstance of this kind that occurred.Mr. Ebenezer Carver had been inves-tigating our doctrines for quite a length of time, and, having a great desire to know the truth of our religion, he walked to the sea shore, wishing that he might have some manifestation in proof of its truth.The passage of Scripture came to his mind that there would be no sign given "but the sign of the prophet Jonas." 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]While this thought was in his mind a large fish arose to the top of the water, a distance from him in the sea, and sud-denly sank out of sight. He much de-sired to see it again, and soon it arose to the top of the water, accompanied by another fish of about the same size, and one of them swam on the water in a straight line towards Mr. Carver as he stood upon the shore. It came as near to him the water would permit, and then stopped and gazed at him with a penetrating eye, as though it had a mes-sage for him. It then returned to its mate in the ocean, and swam out of sight.Mr. Carver retraced his steps home-ward, meditating upon the scene and the wonderful condescension of the Lord.It is proper to remark that this was at a season of the year when fish of that size are never known upon those shores or seas, and they are never, at any sea-son, known to come ashore as in the case mentioned.Mr. Carver was convinced that it was intended by the Lord as a sign to him.Two days after this event I visited Mr. Carver at his house, and found his wife confined to her bed with a fever, and she requested me to administer to her. I placed my hands upon her head, the power of God rested upon me, and I commanded her in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and walk.She arose and was healed from that instant, and she walked down to the sea and I baptized her in the same place where the fish visited her husband. I confirmed her there, and she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and returned to her home rejoicing.I now called the people together and exhorted them to sell their property and prepare to accompany me to the land of Zion. I had labored hard for many days for the temporal and spiritual welfare of the inhabitants of those islands, and the Lord had blessed my labors and given me many souls as seals of my ministry, for which I felt to praise Him; and now I felt to labor quite as zealously to gather out those who had embraced the gospel, and lead them to Zion.The worst difficulty which the Saints had to contend with in that day was from false brethren. Warren Parrish, who had been a prominent elder in the Church, and had labored with me as a[Column 2]missionary, had apostatized and been cut off from the Church. Learning that I was building up branches of the Church upon the island, he and other apostates conspired to block up my way by writing lies to the people and stirring up a spirit of mobocracy upon the islands.They succeeded in exerting a strong influence with the wicked, but I knew they could not hinder the work of God.On the 6th of April I held a meeting at Brother Ebenezer Carver's, and, though the hearts of the wicked were stirred up in bitterness against me, the Spirit of God was with me, and at the close of the meeting I baptized three persons. One of these was Mrs. Abi-gail Carver, the mother of Ebenezer Carver, who was seventy years of age and in poor health. She had not so much as visited a neighbor's house for six years, but upon this occasion she walked with boldness to the sea shore and I baptized her, and she returned rejoicing.On the 11th of April I had the happy privilege of again meeting with Elders Milton Holmes, James Townsend and Abner Rogers, who had come to theislands to attend conference with me.We held our conference on the 13th of April, on North Fox Island, and had a representation of the different branches on the islands. We also preached and bore our testimony, ordained several and baptized one person at the close of the meeting.On the 17th of April Mrs. Woodruffleft the islands to return to her father's home in Scarboro, Maine, and a few days afterwards I called the Saints of the North Island together and communed with and instructed them. I also in-formed them that the Spirit of God bore record to me that it was our duty to leave the islands for a season and take a western mission. They had been faith-fully warned and the Saints were estab-lished in the truth, while the wicked were contending against us, and some were disposed to take our lives if they had the power.On the 28th of April we left the island in an open sail-boat and made our way to Owl's Head, and then walked twenty miles. The following day we walked forty miles and suffered some with weary limbs and blistered feet, but we felt that 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]it was for the gospel's sake and did notchoose to complain. The next day a walk of thirty miles brought us to Scar-boro, where we spent the night at FatherCarter's.On the 8th of May I parted with Mrs. Woodruff and Father Carter and family, and in company with Milton Holmes walked thirty-three miles towards Ports-mouth, which city we reached the fol-lowing day and spent several hours there, visiting the navy yard. We then walked to Georgetown, formerly New Rowley, and spent the night with Father Na-thaniel Holmes.On the 11th of May I visited Charles-ton and Bunker Hill monument, and alsospent several hours in the city of Boston, which then contained a population ofone hundred thousand. I ascended to the cupola of the court house, from which I had a fine view of the city. I visited several of the Saints in the city,and walked over the long bridge to Cambridge and Cambridgeport.I visited the jail there in order to havean interview with Brother A. P. Rock-wood, who had been cast into prison onthe plea of debt, in order to trouble and distress him, because he was a Mormon. This was the first time we had ever met. The jailor permitted me to enter the room where he was. It was the first timein my life I had ever entered a prison. The jailor turned the key upon us and locked us both in.I found Brother Rockwood strong in the faith of the gospel. He had the Bible, Book of Mormon, Voice of Warn-ing and Evening and Morning Star as his companions, which he read daily.We conversed together for three hoursin this solitary abode. He informed meof many things which had transpired while he was confined there as a prisoner.Among other things, he mentioned that the jail had taken fire a few days previous to my visit. He said it looked a littlelike a dark hour. The fire was roaringover his head, while uproar and confu-sion were upon every hand. Fire engines were rapidly playing around the build-ing, with water pouring into every room.The people were hallooing in the streets.Prisoners were begging for mercy's saketo be let out, or they would be consumedin the fire. One was struggling in the agonies of death, while others were[Column 2]cursing and swearing. Brother Rock-wood said he felt composed in the midst of it until the fire was extinguished.At eight o'clock the jailor unlocked theprison door to let me out, and I gavethe parting hand to the prisoner of hope.We had spent a pleasant time together,and he rejoiced at my visit; and who would not, to meet with a friend in alonely prison? I left him in good spirits, and wended my way back to Boston.I spent several days in Boston, hold-ing meetings with the Saints there, and then walked to Providence, Rhode Island, preaching by the way.I there took steamer and arrived inNew York on the 18th of May, where I met with Elder Orson Pratt and his family, and Elijah Fordham and near one hundred Saints who had been bap-tized in the city of New York.I spent three days in New York visit-ing the Saints and holding meetings. Several new converts were baptized whileI was there.Leaving New York, I traveled through New Jersey, and returned to Farming-ton, Connecticut, the residence of myfather. I arrived at his house on the12th of June.It was with peculiar sensations that I walked over my native land, where I spent my youth, and cast my eyes over the Farmington meadows and the hillsand dales where I had roamed in myboyhood with my father, step mother, brothers and half-sister.On my arrival at my father's home I had the happy privilege of again takingmy parents and sister by the hand, alsomy uncle, Ozem Woodruff, who was among the number I had baptized theyear before.After spending an hour in conversa-tion, we sat down around our father's table and supped together and were re-freshed. Then we bowed upon our knees together in the family circle andoffered up the gratitude of our hearts toGod for preserving our lives and reunit-ing us.I spent the next eighteen days inFarmington and Avon, visiting my father's household, my uncles, aunts cousins, neighbors and friends, preach-ing the gospel of Jesus Christ unto themand striving to bring them into thekingdom of God. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]On the 1st of July, 1838, one of the most interesting events transpired of mywhole life in the ministry.When Father Joseph Smith gave me my patriarchal blessing, among the many wonderful things of my life, he promised me that I should bring my father's house-hold into the kingdom of God, and I felt that if ever I obtained the blessing,the time had come for me to perform it.By the help of God, I preached thegospel faithfully to my father's house-hold and to all that were with him, as well as to my other relatives, and I had appointed a meeting on Sunday, the 1st of July, at my father's home.My father was believing my testimony, as were all in his household, but upon this occasion the devil was determinedto hinder the fulfillment of the promiseof the patriarch unto me.It seemed as though Lucifer, the son of the morning, had gathered togetherthe hosts of hell and exerted his powers upon us all. Distress overwhelmed the whole household, and all were temptedto reject the work. And it seemed asthough the same power would devourme. 1 had to take to my bed for an hour before the time of meeting. I there prayed unto the Lord with my wholesoul for deliverance, for I knew thepower of the devil was exercised to hin-der me from accomplishing what Godhad promised me.The Lord heard my prayer and an-swered my petition, and when the hourof meeting had come I arose from my bed, and could sing and shout for joy to think I had been delivered from thepower of the evil one.Filled with the power of God, I stood up in the midst of the congregation and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ untothe people in great plainness.At the close of the meeting we assem-bled on the banks of the FarmingtonRiver, "because there was much waterthere," and I led six of my friends into the river and baptized them for the re-mission of their sins.All of my father's household were in-cluded in this number, according to thepromise of the Patriarch. They wereall relatives except Dwight Webster, who was a Methodist class-leader and was boarding with my father's family.I organized the small number of nine[Column 2]persons, eight of whom were my relatives, into a branch of the Church, and or-dained Dwight Webster to the office of a priest and administered the sacramentunto them.It was truly a day of joy to my soul. My father, stepmother, and sister wereamong the number baptized. I after-wards added a number of relatives. Ifelt that this day's work alone amply re-paid me for all my labors in the min-istry.Now, as my mission to my native land was accomplished, which I felt im-pressed to take while I was upon theislands, I felt it my duty to return here.Monday, July 2nd, 1838, was the last day and night I spent at my father'shome while upon this mission. At thesetting of the sun I took the last walk with my sister I ever had with her while in my native State. We walked by thecanal and viewed the river and the fields, and conversed upon our futuredestiny.After evening prayer with the family, my father retired to rest, and I spent a season with my stepmother, who had reared me from my infancy. In conver-sation we felt sensibly the weight of the power of temptation, out of which the Lord had delivered us.I also spent a short time with my sis-ter Eunice, the only sister I was ever blessed with in my father's family. I had baptized her into the Church andKingdom of God, and we mingled oursympathies, prayers, and tears togetherbefore the throne of grace.How truly are the bonds of consan-guinity and of the blood of Christ united in binding the hearts of the Saints ofGod together, and "how blessings brighten as they take their flight."This being the last night I was to spend beneath my father's roof while upon this mission, I felt the weight of it, and my prayer was, "O, Lord, protectmy father's house, and bring him to Zion!" (which prayer was granted.)On the morning of July 3rd, I took leave of my relatives and my nativeland, and started on my return toMaine.I arrived in Scarboro on the 6th, and on the 14th my first child—a daughter—was born at Father Carter's house. We named her Sarah Emma. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]On the 30th of July, I left my wife and child at Father Carter's and startedonce more to visit Fox Islands.While holding meeting with the Saints at North Vinal Haven on the 9th of August, I received a letter from Thomas B. Marsh, who was then President of theTwelve Apostles, informing me thatJoseph Smith, the Prophet, had receiveda revelation, naming as persons to bechosen to fill the places of those who had fallen: John E. Page, John Taylor, Wil-ford Woodruff and Willard Richards.President Marsh added, in his letter, "Know then, Brother Woodruff, by this,that you are appointed to fill the place of one of the Twelve Apostles, and that it is agreeable to the word of the Lord, given very lately, that you should comespeedily to Far West, and, on the 26th of April next, take your leave of the Saints here and depart for other climesacross the mighty deep."The substance of this letter had beenrevealed to me several weeks before, butI had not named it to any person.The time having now come for me toprepare for leaving the islands, I had a desire to take with me all the Saints I could get to go to Zion. There had al-ready been a line drawn upon the islandsbetween the Saints and those who had rejected the gospel, and the enemieswere very bitter against me and the workof God I had labored to establish. They threatened my life, but the Saints were willing to stand by me.I spent four days with the Saints visit-ing them, holding meetings and encour-aging them, while the devil was raging upon every hand.I had baptized and organized into the Church nearly one hundred persons whileupon the islands, and there seemed a prospect of gathering about half of them with me, but the devil raged to such an extent that quite a number were terri-fied.The inhabitants of the islands had butlittle acquaintance with the managementof horses or wagons; in fact, most ofthem knew more about handling a sharkthan a horse. However, in company with Nathanial Thomas, who had soldhis property and had money, I went tothe mainland and purchased ten new wagons, ten sets of harness and twentyhorses. When I got everything prepared[Column 2]for the company to start, I left the affairs with Brother Thomas, and went on ahead of the company to Scarboro, to prepare my own family for the journey.The outfit which I purchased for the company cost about two thousand dollars.Before leaving Brother Thomas, I coun-selled him in regard to the course to pur-sue, and charged him not to be laterthan the 1st of September in startingfrom the mainland.I arrived at Father Carter's on the 19th of August, and waited with great anxiety for the arrival of the company from theislands, but instead of reaching there by the 1st of September they did not arrive till the 3rd of October; and when they did arrive the wagon covers were all fly-ing in the breeze. It took a good day's work to nail down the covers, paint thewagons and get prepared for the journey.On the afternoon of the 9th of Octo-ber, we took leave of Father Carter andfamily, and started upon our journey of two thousand miles at this late season ofthe year, taking my wife with a suckling babe at her breast with me, to lead a company of fifty-three souls from Maine to Illinois, and to spend nearly threemonths in traveling in wagons, throughrain, mud, snow and frost. It was sucha trial as I never before had attempted during my experience as a minister of thegospel.On our arrival at Georgetown we were joined by Elder Milton Holmes. We traveled each day as far as we could go, and camped wherever night overtook us.On the 13th of October, while cross-ing the Green Mountains, I was attacked with something resembling the cholera.I was very sick. I stopped at a housefor about two hours, but the Elders ad-ministered to me, and I revived.On the 24th I was again taken sick, and my wife and child were also strickendown. We also had several others sick in the company, through the exposure of the journey.On the 31st we had our first snow storm, and the horses dragged our wagonsall day through mud, snow and water.On the 2nd of November Elder MiltonHolmes left us, and took steamer forFairport; and two days afterwards a lit-tle child of Nathaniel Thomas', about six years of age, died, and we had tobury it at Westfield. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]The roads finally became so bad and the cold so severe that Nathaniel Thomas and James Townsend concluded to stopfor the winter. We parted with them on the 21st of November, near New Portage, Ohio.On the 23rd of November my wife, Phoebe, was attacked with a severe head-ache, which terminated in brain fever. She grew more and more distressed daily as we continued our journey. It was a terrible ordeal for a woman to travel in a wagon over rough roads, afflicted asshe was. At the same time our child was also very sick.The first of December was a tryingday to my soul. My wife continued tofail, and in the afternoon, about four o'clock, she appeared to be struck with death. I stopped my team, and it seemed as though she would breath herlast lying in the wagon. Two of the sisters sat beside her, to see if they coulddo anything for her in her last moments.1 stood upon the ground, in deep af-fliction, and meditated. I cried untothe Lord, and prayed that she might liveand not be taken from me. I claimed thepromises the Lord had made unto me through the prophets and patriarchs, andsoon her spirit revived, and I drove a short distance to a tavern, and got herinto a room and worked over her and herbabe all night, and prayed to the Lord to preserve her life.In the morning the circumstances were such that I was under the necessity of removing my wife from the inn, as therewas so much noise and confusion at the place that she could not endure it. Icarried her out to her bed in the wagonand drove two miles, when I alighted at a house and carried my wife and her bed into it, with a determination to tarrythere until she recovered her health oror passed away. This was on Sunday morning, December 2nd.After getting my wife and things intothe house and wood provided to keep upa fire, I employed my time in taking care of her. It looked as though she had but a short time to live.She called me to her bedside in theevening and said she felt as though afew moments more would end her exist-ence in this life. She manifested great confidence in the cause she had em-braced, and exhorted me to have confi-[Column 2]dence in God, and to keep his com-mandments.To all appearances she was dying. I laid hands upon her and prayed for her,and she soon revived and slept some dur-ing the night.December 3rd found my wife very low. I spent the day in taking care of her, and the following day I returned to Eaton to get some things for her. She seemed to be gradually sinking, and inthe evening the spirit apparently left her body, and she was dead.The sisters gathered around her body,weeping, while I stood looking at her insorrow. The spirit and power of God began to rest upon me until, for the firsttime during her sickness, faith filled mysoul, although she lay before me as one dead.I had some oil that was consecratedfor my anointing while in Kirtland. I took it and consecrated it again beforethe Lord for anointing the sick. I thenbowed down before the Lord and prayedfor the life of my companion, and I anointed her body with the oil in thename of the Lord. I laid my handsupon her, and in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuked the power of death andthe destroyer, and commanded the sameto depart from her and the spirit of lifeto enter her body.Her spirit returned to her body, and from that hour she was made whole; and we all felt to praise the name of God, and to trust in Him and keep His com-mandments.While this operation was going on with me (as my wife related afterwards) her spirit left her body, and she saw it lying upon the bed, and the sisters weep-ing. She looked at them and at me, and upon her babe, and, while gazingupon this scene, two personages cameinto the room, carrying a coffin, and toldher they had come for her body. Oneof these messengers told her she mighthave her choice—she might go to rest in the spirit world, or, on one condition she could have the privilege of returning toher tabernacle and continuing her laborsupon the earth. The condition was, if she felt that she could stand by her hus-band, and with him pass through all the cares, trials, tribulations and afflictions of life which he would be called upon topass through for the gospel's sake unto 
 [Column 1]the end. When she looked at the situ-ation of her husband and child she said: "Yes, I will do it."At the moment that decision wasmade the power of faith rested upon me, and when I administered unto her, her spirit entered her tabernacle, and she saw the messengers carry the coffin outof the door.On the morning of the 6th of Decem-ber, the Spirit said to me, "Arise and continue thy journey," and through themercy of God my wife was enabled to arise and dress herself, and walked to thewagon, and we went on our way re-joicing.On the night of the 11th I stoppedfor the night at an inn, the weather be-ing very cold. I there learned of thesudden death of my brother, Asahel H. Woodruff, a merchant of Terre Haute,Indiana.I had anticipated a joyful meeting with this brother on the following day. Instead of this, I only had the privilege of visiting his grave, in company withmy wife, and examining a little into hisbusiness.I was offered the position of admin-[Column 2]istrator of his affairs, but I was leadinga company of Saints to Zion, and couldnot stop to attend to his temporal busi-ness. Strangers settled his affairs and took possession of his property. His relatives obtained nothing from his effects but a few trifling mementos.I left this place and crossed intoIllinois on the 13th of December, andarrived at Rochester on the 19th, and, getting information of the severe perse-cutions of the Saints in Missouri, and the unsettled state of the Church at that time, we concluded to stop at Rochesterand spend the winter.Thus ended my journey of two monthsand sixteen days, leading the Fox Island Saints to the west, through all the perilsof a journey of nearly two thousand miles, in the midst of sickness and greatseverity of weather.I took my family in the spring and removed to Quincy, Illinois, where I could mingle with my brethren, and Ifelt to praise God for His protecting careover me and my family in all ourafflictions.TO BE CONTINUED. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]CHAPTER II.ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP—MY MIS-SION TO ENGLAND.Joseph Smith, the Prophet, asked theLord what His will was concerning theTwelve, and the Lord answered in a revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in whichHe says: "Let them take leave of my Saints in the city Far West, on the 26thday of April next, on the building spot of my house, saith the Lord. Let my servant John Taylor, and also my ser-vant John E. Page, and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be appointed to fill the places of those who have fallen, and be officially notified of their appoint-ment.'"It will be observed that this differsfrom nearly all other revelations in this respect: a fixed day and a stated placewere given for the commencement of the mission. When the revelation wasgiven, all was peace and quietude in FarWest, Missouri, the city where most of the Latter day Saints dwelt; but before the time came for its fulfillment, theSaints of God had been driven out of the State of Missouri into the State ofIllinois, under the edict of Governor Boggs; and the Missourians had swornthat if all the other revelations of JosephSmith were fulfilled, that should not be. It stated the day and the place where theTwelve Apostles should take leave of theSaints, to go on their missions across the great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-souri had declared that they would see that it should not be fulfilled.It seemed as though the Lord, havinga foreknowledge of what would take place, had given the revelation in thismanner to see whether the Apostles would obey it at the risk of their lives.When the time drew near for the ful-fillment of this commandment of the Lord, Brigham Young was the President of the Twelve Apostles; Thomas B.Marsh, who was the senior Apostle, had fallen. Brother Brigham called togetherthose of the Twelve who were then at Quincy, Illinois, to see what their minds would be about going to Far West, tofulfill the revelation. The Prophet Jos-[Column 2]eph and his brother Hyrum, Sidney Rig-don, Lyman Wight and Parley P. Prattwere in prison in Missouri at the time; but Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch,was at Quincy, Illinois. He and others who were present did not think it wis-dom for us to attempt the journey, as our lives would be in great jeopardy. They thought the Lord would take thewill for the deed. But when President Young asked the Twelve what our feel-ings were upon the subject, we all of us, as the voice of one man, said the Lord God had spoken, and it was for us to obey. It was the Lord's business to takecare of His servants, and we would ful-fill the commandment, or die trying.To fully understand the risk theTwelve ran in making this journey, myreaders should remember that Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-souri, had issued a proclamation, in which all the Latter-day Saints were re-quired to leave that State or be exter-minated. Far West had been captured by the militia, who were really only anorganized mob; the citizens had beencompelled to give up their arms; all the leading men who could be got hold ofhad been taken prisoners; the rest of the Saints—men, women and children— had to flee as best they could out of the State to save their lives, leaving all their houses, lands and other property which they could not carry with them to be taken by the mob. In fact they shot down the cattle and hogs of the Saints wherever they could find them, and robbed them of nearly everything theycould lay their hands upon. Latter-daySaints were treated with merciless cruelty and had to endure the most outrageous abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-culty that many of them got out of the State, especially the prominent men; forthere were many men of that State at that time, who acted as though they thought it no more harm to shoot a Mormon than a mad dog. From this brief explanation you will be able to un-derstand why some of the brethren thought we were not required to go back to Far West to start from there upon ourmission across the ocean to Europe.Having determined to carry out the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]requirement of the revelation, on the 18th of April, 1839, I took into my wagon Brigham Young and Orson Pratt: and Father Cutler took into his wagon John Taylor and George A. Smith, andwe started for Far West.On the way we met John E. Page, who was going with his family to Quincy,Illinois. His wagon had turned over, and when we met him he was trying togather up a barrel of soft soap with his hands. We helped him get up his wagon.He drove down into the valley below, left his wagon, and accompanied us on our way.On the night of the 25th of April, we arrived at Far West, and spent the night at the home of Morris Phelps, whowas not there, however, himself; he,having been taken prisoner by the mob, was still in prison.On the morning of the 26th of April,1839, notwithstanding the threats of our enemies that the revelation which was tobe fulfilled this day should not be, and notwithstanding that ten thousand of theSaints had been driven out of the State by the edict of the governor, and though the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hy-rum Smith, with other leading men were in the hands of our enemies, in chainsand in prison, we moved on to the tem-ple grounds in the city of Far West, and held a council, and fulfilled the revela-tion and commandment given unto us, and we performed many other things at this council.We excommunicated from the Church thirty-one persons, who had apostatizedand become its enemies.The "Mission of the Twelve" was sung, and we then repaired to the south-east corner of the temple ground, and,with the assistance of Elder Alpheus Cutler, the master workman of the building committee, laid the southeastchief corner stone of the temple, accord-ing to revelation.There were present of the Twelve Apostles: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, John E. Page, and John Taylor, who proceeded toordain Wilford Woodruff and GeorgeA. Smith to the Apostleship.The Twelve then took their leave of, and gave the parting hand to the follow-ing Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.Butler, Elias Smith, Norman Shearer,[Column 2]William Burton, Stepen Markham, Shad-rach Roundy, William O. Clark, John W. Clark, Hezekiah Peck, Darwin Chase, Richard Howard, Mary Ann Peck, Artimesia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah Granger, Theodore Turley, Hi-ram Clark, and Daniel Shearer.Bidding good-by to the small remnant of the Saints who remained on the templeground to see us fulfill the revelation and commandments of God, we turned ourbacks on Far West and Missouri, andreturned to Illinois. We had accom-plished the mission without a dog movinghis tongue at us, or any man saying,"Why do you do so?"We crossed the Mississippi river on thesteam ferry, entered Quincy on the 2nd of May, and all had the joy of reaching our families once more in peace andsafety.There was an incident connected withour journey that is worthy of record.While we were on our way to fulfill the revelation, Joseph, the Prophet, andhis companions in chains had been liber-ated, through the blessings of God, fromtheir enemies and prison, and they passedus. We were not far distant from each other, but neither party knew it. They were making their way to their familiesin Illinois, while we were traveling to Far West into the midst of our enemies.So they came home to their families and friends before our return.May the 3rd was a very interesting day to me, as well as to others. In companywith five others of the quorum of the Twelve, I rode four miles out of town toMr. Cleveland's, to visit Brother Joseph Smith and his family.Once more I had the happy privilege of taking Brother Joseph by the hand. Two years had rolled away since I had seen his face. He greeted us with great joy, as did Hyrum Smith and Lyman Wight, all of whom had escaped fromtheir imprisonment together. They had been confined in prison six months, and had been under sentence of death three times; yet their lives were in the hands of God, and He had delivered them,and they were now mingling with theirwives, children and friends, and out ofthe reach of the mob. Joseph was frank, open and familiar as usual, and our rejoicing was great.No man can understand the joyful sen- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]sations created by such a meeting, ex-cept those who have been in tribulation for the gospel's sake.After spending the day together, wereturned to our families at night.On the day following, May 4th, wemet in conference at Quincy, the ProphetJoseph presiding, which caused great joyand rejoicing to all the Saints.On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smithaddressed the assembly, followed bySidney Rigdon and the Twelve Apostles.The Spirit of the Lord was poured outupon us, and we had a glorious day.On May 6th, I met with the Seventies,and we ordained sixty men into the quorums of elders and seventies. Brother Joseph met with the Twelve, bishops andelders, at Bishop Partridge's house; andthere were a number with us who were wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them was Isaac Laney, who had been in com-pany with about twenty others, at themill, when a large armed mob fired among them with rifles and other weapons, and shot down seventeen of the brethren, and wounded more. Brother Laney fled from the scene, but theypoured a shower of lead after him, whichpierced his body through and through. He showed me eleven bullet holes in hisbody. There were twenty-seven in hisshirt, seven in his pantaloons, and hiscoat was literally cut to pieces. Oneball entered one arm-pit and came outat the other.Another entered his back and came out at the breast. A ball passed througheach hip, each leg and each arm. All these shots were received while he was running for life, and, strange as it may appear, though he had also one of hisribs broken, he was able to outrun hisenemies, and his life was saved. We can only acknowledge this deliverance to be by the power and mercy of God.President Joseph Young was alsoamong the number. He also fled, andalthough the balls flew around him likehail, he was not wounded. How myste-rious are the ways of the Lord!Before starting on our missions toEngland, we were under the necessityof settling our families. A place calledCommerce, afterwards named Nauvoo, was selected as the place at which ourpeople should settle.I left Quincy, in company with[Column 2]Brother Brigham Young and our familieson the 15th of May, and arrived in Commerce on the 18th. After an inter-view with Joseph we crossed the river at Montrose, Iowa. President Brigham Young and myself, with our families, occupied one room about fourteen feet square. Finally Brother Young obtainedanother room and moved into it by him-self. Then Brother Orson Pratt and family moved into the same room with myself and family.While I was living in this cabin in theold barracks, we experienced a day of God's power with the Prophet Joseph.It was a very sickly time and Joseph hadgiven up his home in Commerce to thesick, and had a tent pitched in his door-yard and was living in that himself. The large number of Saints who hadbeen driven out of Missori, were flock-ing into Commerce; but had no homes to go into, and were living in wagons,in tents, and on the ground. Many, therefore, were sick through the ex-posure they were subjected to. Bro-ther Joseph had waited on the sick,until he was worn out and nearly sickhimself.On the morning of the 22nd of July,1839, he arose reflecting upon the sit-uation of the Saints of God in theirpersecutions and afflictions, and he called upon the Lord in prayer, and thepower of God rested upon him mightily,and as Jesus healed all the sick aroundHim in His day, so Joseph, the Prophetof God, healed all around on this occa-sion. He healed all in his house anddoor-yard, then, in company with SidneyRigdon and several of the Twelve, he went through among the sick lying onthe bank of the river, and he com-manded them in a loud voice, in thename of Jesus Christ, to come up and be made whole, and they were all healed.When he healed all that were sick on the east side of the river, they crossedthe Mississippi river in a ferry-boat tothe west side, to Montrose, where we were. The first house they went into was President Brigham Young's. Hewas sick on his bed at the time. TheProphet went into his house and healedhim, and they all came out together.As they were passing by my door, BrotherJoseph said: "Brother Woodruff, fol-low me." These were the only words 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]spoken by any of the company from the time they left Brother Brigham's housetill we crossed the public square, and entered Brother Fordham's house. Bro-ther Fordham had been dying for anhour, and we expected each minutewould be his last.I felt the power of God that wasoverwhelming His Prophet.When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,and took him by the right hand; in hisleft hand he held his hat.He saw that Brother Fordham's eyeswere glazed, and that he was speechless and unconscious.After taking hold of his hand, he looked down into the dying man's faceand said: "Brother Fordham do younot know me?" At first he made no reply; but we could all see the effect of the spirit of God resting upon him.He again said: "Elijah, do you notknow me?"With a low whisper, Brother Ford-ham answered, "Yes!"The Prophet then said, "Have you not faith to be healed?"The answer, which was a little plainerthan before, was: "I am afraid it is toolate. If you had come sooner, I thinkit might have been."He had the appearance of a man wak-ing from sleep. It was the sleep of death.Joseph then said: "Do you believethat Jesus is the Christ?""I do, Brother Joseph," was the re-ponse.Then the Prophet of God spoke witha loud voice, as in the majesty of the Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, inthe name of Jesus of Nazareth, to ariseand be made whole!''The words of the Prophet were not like the words of man, but like the voiceof God. It seemed to me that thehouse shook from its foundation.Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was manifested in every act.His feet were done up in Indian meal poultices. He kicked them off his feet, scattered the contents, and then called for his clothes and put them on. Heasked for a bowl of bread and milk, andate it; then put on his hat and followed[Column 2]us into the street, to visit others whowere sick.The unbeliever may ask: "Was there not deception in this?"If there is any deception in the mind of the unbeliever, there was certainly none with Elijah Fordham, the dying man, nor with those who were presentwith him, for in a few minutes he wouldhave been in the spirit world, had he not been rescued. Through the bless-ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in which year he died in Utah, while all who were with him on that occasion,with the exception of one, are in thespirit world.Among the number were Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, BrighamYoung, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt. Wilford Woodruff is the only one living who was present at that time, and he will soon mingle with those who havegone.As soon as we left Brother Fordham'shouse, we went into the house of JosephB. Noble, who was very low and danger-ously sick.When we entered the house, BrotherJoseph took him by the hand, and com-manded him, in the name of JesusChrist, to arise and be made whole. He did arise and was immediatelyhealed.While this was going on, the wickedmob in the place, led by one Kilburn,had become alarmed, and followed us into Brother Noble's house.Before they arrived there, Brother Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-ham to offer prayer.While he was praying, the mob en-tered, with all the evil spirits accom-panying them.As soon as they entered, Brother Fordham, who was praying, fainted and sank to the floor.When Joseph saw the mob in thehouse, he arose and had the room clearedof both that class of men and their at-tendant devils. Then Brother Fordhamimmediately revived and finished his prayer.This case of Brother Noble's was thelast one of healing upon that day. It was greatest day for the manifestation ofthe power of God through the gift of 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]healing since the organization of the Church.When we left Brother Noble, theProphet Jeseph went, with those who accompanied him from the other side tothe banks of the river, to return home.While waiting for the ferry-boat, aman of the world, knowing of the mir-acles which had been performed, cameto him and asked him if he would not go and heal two twin children of hisabout five months old, who were bothlying sick nigh unto death.They were some two miles from Mon-trose.The Prophet said he could not go;but, after pausing some time, he said he would send some one to heal them;and he turned to me and said: "You go with the man and heal his children."He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handkerchief when I administered to them, and they should be healed. Healso said unto me: "As long as you willkeep that handkerchief, it shall remaina league between you and me.''I went with the man, and did as theProphet commanded me, and the chil-dren were healed.I have possession of the handkerchief unto this day.On the first of July, 1839, JosephSmith and his counselors, Sydney Rig-don and Hyrum Smith, crossed the river to Montrose, to spend the day with the Twelve, and set them apart and bless them, before they started upon theirmissions. There were twelve of us who met there, and we all dined in my house.After dinner, we assembled at Brother Brigham Young's house for our meeting.Brother Hyrum Smith opened by prayer; after which the Presidency laidtheir hands upon our heads and gaveeach of us a blessing.President Rigdon was mouth in bless-ing me, and also blessed Sisters Young, Taylor and Woodruff.The prophet Joseph promised us if we would be faithful, we should be blessedupon our mission, have many souls as seals of our ministry, and return againin peace and safety to our families andfriends; all of which was fulfilled.Brother Hyrum advised me to preach[Column 2]the first principles of the gospel; hethought that was about as much as thisgeneration could endure.Then Joseph arose and preached some precious things of the kingdom of God unto us, in the power of the Holy Ghost; some of which I here copy from my journal:"Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready to forgive our brethren on the first intimation of theirrepentance and desire for forgiveness;for our Heavenly Father will be equallyas merciful unto us. We also ought to be willing to repent of and confess our sins, and keep nothing back. Let the Twelve be humble and not be exalted,and beware of pride and not seek to ex-cel one another, but act for each other'sgood, and honorably make mention of each other's names in prayer before the Lord and before your fellow-men. Do not backbite or devour a brother. The elders of Israel should seek to learn byprecept and example in this late age ofthe world and not be obliged to learn everything we know by sad experience. I trust the remainder of the Twelve willlearn wisdom and not follow the exampleof those who have fallen. When the Twelve, or any other witnesses of JesusChrist, stand before the congregationsof the earth, and they preach in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, and the people are astonishedand confounded at the doctrine, and say'That man has preached a powerful ser-mon,' then let that man or those mentake care that they do not ascribe the glory unto themselves, but be carefulthat they are humble, and ascribe theglory to God and the Lamb; for it is by the power of the Holy Priesthood andthe Holy Ghost that they have the powerthus to speak."Who art thou, O man, but dust! and from whom dost thou receive thy powerand blessings, but from God?"Then let the Twelve Apostles and Elders of Israel observe this key, and bewise: Ye are not sent out to be taught, but to teach."Let every man be sober, be vigilant, and let all his words be seasoned withgrace, and keep in mind it is a day of warning, and not of many words."Act honestly before God and man; beware of sophistry, such as bowing and 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]scraping unto men in whom you have noconfidence. Be honest, open, and frank in all your intercourse with mankind."I wish to say to the Twelve and all the Saints, to profit by this importantkey, that in all your trials, troubles,temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprison-ments and deaths, see to it that you donot betray Jesus Christ, that you do notbetray the revelations of God, whetherin the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doc-trine and Covenants, or any of the words of God."Yea, in all your troubles, see that you do not this thing, lest innocent blood be found upon your skirts, and ye go down to hell."We may ever know by this sign that there is danger of our being led to a fall and apostasy when we give way to thedevil, so as to neglect the first known duty; but whatever you do, do not be-tray your friend."The foregoing are some of the instruc-tions given to the Twelve by the ProphetJoseph, before they started upon theirmissions.Inasmuch as the devil had been in ameasure thwarted by the Twelve goingto Far West, and returning withoutharm, it seemed as though the destroyer was determined to make some other at-tempt upon us to hinder us from per-forming our missions; for it seemed that as soon as any one of the Apostles began to prepare for starting, he was smitten with chills and fever or sickness of somekind.Nearly all of the quorum of theTwelve or their families began to besick, so it still required the exercise of agood deal of faith and perseverance tostart off on a mission.On the 25th of July, for the first timein my life, I was attacked with chills and fever; and this I had every other day,and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-trate.My wife, Phoebe, was also soon taken down with the chills and fever, as were quite a number of the Twelve.I passed thirteen days in Montrose with my family, after I was taken sick, before I started on my mission.The 7th of August was the last day I spent at home in Montrose, and althoughsick with the chills and fever the most ofthe day, I made what preparations I[Column 2]could to start on the morrow on a mis-sion of four thousand miles, to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth,and this, too, without purse or scrip, with disease resting upon me, and astroke of fever and ague once every two days.Early upon the morning of the 8th of August, I arose from my bed of sickness, laid my hands upon the head of my sick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I then departed from the embrace of mycompanion, and left her almost withoutfood or the necessaries of life.She parted from me with the fortitudethat becomes a Saint, realizing the re-sponsibilities of her companion. I quotefrom my journal:"Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer; remember me in your prayers. I leave these pages for your perusal when I am gone. I shall see thy face again in theflesh. I go to obey the commands ofJesus Christ."Although feeble, I walked to thebanks of the Mississippi river. There President Young took me in a canoe(having no other conveyance) and pad-dled me across the river.When we landed, I lay down on aside of sole leather, by the post office, to rest.Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God, came along and looked at me."Well, Brother Woodruff," said he,"you have started upon your mission.""Yes," said I, "but I feel and look more like a subject for the dissectingroom than a missionary."Joseph replied: "What did you saythat for? Get up, and go along; all will be right with you!"I name these incidents that the reader may know how the brethren of theTwelve Apostles started upon their mis-sions to England, in 1839.Elder John Taylor was going with me,and we were the first two of the quorumof the Twelve who started on theirmission.Brother Taylor was about the only man in the quorum that was not sick.Soon a brother came along with awagon, and took us in. As we were driving through the place, we came toParley P. Pratt, who was stripped to theshirt and pants with his head and feet 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]bare. He was hewing a log, preparingto build a cabin.He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have no money, but I have an empty purse,which I will give you..' He brought it to me, and I thanked him for it.We went a few rods further, and metBrother Heber C. Kimball, in the same condition, also hewing a log, towards building a cabin.He said: "As Parley has given you a purse, I have got a dollar I will give you to put in it."He gave me both a dollar and a bless-ing.We drove sixteen miles across a prairie, and spent the night with a Brother Mer-rill. The day following we rode ten miles, to a Brother Perkins', and he tookus in his wagon to Macomb, and fromthence to Brother Don Carlos Smith's.I rode four hours during the day overa very rough road of stones and stumps, lying on my back in the bottom of thewagon, shaking with the ague, and I suffered much.We held a meeting in a grove near Don Carlos Smith's, and here Elder Taylor baptized George Miller, who afterwards was ordained a bishop.At the meeting the Saints gave us ninedollars, and George Miller gave us a horse to help us on our journey.I rode to Rochester with Father Col-trin, where I had an interview with several families of the Fox Island Saints, whom I had brought up with me from Fox Islands in 1838. I spent several days with them and at Springfield, whereElder Taylor published fifteen hundred copies, in pamphlet form, of a brief sketch of the persecutions and sufferingsof the Latter-dav Saints, inflicted by theinhabitants of Missouri.We sold our horse, and in company with Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor and myself left Springfield, and continuedour journey.I had the chills and fever nearly everyother day, which made riding in a lum-ber wagon very distressing to me, es-pecially when I shook with the ague.On the 24th of August, we rode to Terre Haute, and spent the night withDr. Modisett. I suffered much with thechills and fever.Elder John Taylor up to this time had appeared to enjoy excellent health, but[Column 2]the destroyer did not intend to makehim an exception to the rest of the Apostles. On the 28th of August, he fell to the ground as though he had beenknocked down. He fainted away, butsoon revived. On the following day, however, the enemy made a powerful attack upon his life. He fainted awayseveral times, and it seemed as thoughhe would die. We stopped several hours with him at a house by the wayside. We then took him into the wagon and drove to Horace S. Eldredge's, and spent the remainder of the day and night doctoring him.In the morning Brother Taylor was so far recovered that he thought he wouldbe able to ride. So we started on our journey on the morning of the 30th, and we traveled forty miles, to Louisville, and spent the night with the family of Brother James Townsend.We felt terribly shaken up, being in such a weak state. Brother Townsend was away from home, but we were kindlyentertained by Sister Townsend.In the morning Elder Taylor, though very weak, felt disposed to continue hisjourney. We traveled fourteen miles to Germantown. He was quite sick at night, and the bilious fever seemed to settle upon him. I was also very feeble, myself.On the day following, September 1st, being Sunday, Brother Taylor concludedto remain there for the day, and hold ameeting.It was a German settlement. He wished me to speak, and I spoke upon the first principles of the gospel. He followed me, and spoke until he was ex-hausted.After we returned to the inn where we were stopping, I was taken with a chill and fever, and had a very bad night. Brother Taylor was also very sick.The following day, September 2nd, was a painful day to my feelings. It was evident that Brother Taylor had a settled fever upon him, and would not be able to travel.Father Coltrin was resolved to con-tinue his journey, and, in conversing with Brother Taylor, he thought it better for one sick man to be left than for two, as I was so sick with the chills and fever that I was not able to render him any assistance, nor, indeed, to take care of 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE[Column 1]myself. Under these circumstances, Brother Taylor advised me to continue my journey with Brother Coltrin, and make the best of my way to New York.After committing Elder Taylor intothe hands of the Lord, though painful to me, I gave him the parting hand andstarted. I left him in Germantown, Wayne County, Indiana, in the hand sofa merciful God and a kind and benevo-lent family, who promised to do every-thing in their power to make him com-fortable until his recovery.This they did, though he passed through a severe course of the billiousfever, and was sick nigh unto death.Through the mercy of God, however, he recovered from his sickness, and con-tinued his journey. We next met in the City of New York.I continued my journey with Father Coltrin, and we reached Cleveland onthe 18th of September. We there tooksteamer for Buffalo, but were three days and a night in a storm before we made the harbor. We landed at midnight, and in doing so we ran into a schooner, and stove it in.From Buffalo I traveled to Albany in a canal boat, and had a stroke of the ague daily.While on my journey, at Albany, I took a stage in the night, and rode tomy father's home in Farmington, on the21st of September.I was glad to meet with my father's family and the other members of thesmall branch of the Church which ex-isted there upon this occasion, as I found them all strong in the faith of the gos-pel, and glad to meet with me.I was still suffering with the aguedaily.On the 27th of September, my grand-mother (on my mother's side), AnnaThompson, died at Avon. She was eighty-four years of age.It was a singular coincidence that shewith her husband, Lot Thompson, also Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thomp-son, all of one family, died when theywere eighty-four years of age. I wasnot able to attend my grandmother's funeral.On the 4th of October, 1839, my uncle, Adna Hart, died, aged forty-three years. I had visited him in his sickness,and preached the gospel to him, and he[Column 2]was believing. I had also been associated with him from my youth up.On his death-bed he sent me a request that I would preach his funeral sermon.I was having the chills and feverdaily at the time, attended with a very severe cough, so much so, that my fatherthought that I would never leave his home alive. But when they brought methe request of my dying uncle, and the day came for his burial, I told my fatherto get his horse and buggy ready, for I was going to attend the funeral.He thought I was very reckless in re-gard to my own life, as I had suffered with the chills and fever some fifteen days, and to attempt to speak in my weak state, and to begin at the samehour that my chill was to come on, seemed to him foolhardy.My parents were quite alarmed, yetaccording to my request my father got up his team, and I rode with him and my stepmother five miles, through a cold, chilly wind, and I commenced speaking to a large congregation, at thesame hour that my chill had been in the habit of coming on.I spoke over an hour with great free-dom, and my chill left me from that hour, and I had no more attacks formany days.On the Monday following, October 17th, I felt sufficiently restored to health to continue my journey. I took leave of my father and sister, and left for New York, where I arrived on the morning of the 8th of November.I spent two months and seven days after my arrival in New York, in travel-ing and preaching in that city, NewJersey and Long Island, a portion of thetime with Parley and Orson Pratt. I had frequent attacks during this time of the chills and fever, but I preached al-most daily.On the 13th of December I attendedour conference in New York City, with Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder John Taylor arrived in our midst, and it was a happy meeting.He had passed through a severe siegeof sickness after we parted, but throughthe mercy of God had been preserved,and was able to continue his journey. He also informed us that others of theTwelve had suffered a great deal of sick- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]ness, and that it was with difficulty thatthey could travel.After spending six days in New York, Elder John Taylor, in company with Elder Theodore Turley and myself sailed out of New York Harbor for Liverpool, on board the packet ship Oxford, on the19th of December, 1839.We took steerage passage, which cost fifteen dollars each. We had storms and rough weather, but most of the winds were favorable for a quick passage.While on the ship, a Methodist min-ister got into a discussion with some Cath-olics who were in the company, and the arguments of the minister ran rather more into abuse than sound argument.Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-ister that he did not think it was becom-ing in a daughter to find so much fault with the mother as they did, for as the Methodists came out of the Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the mother had asmuch right to enjoy her religion un-molested as the daughter had. That ended the argument.Our company consisted of 109 souls,composed of Americans, English, Scotch,Irish, Welsh and Dutch.We arrived in Liverpool dock on the 11th day of January, 1840, having madethe voyage from New York in twenty-three days.On January 13th, 1840, after visiting Mr. George Cannon, the father of Presi-dent George Q. Cannon, and his family, we took cars in the evening, and arrived in the midst of the Preston branch of the Saints, built up in 1837, by Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and Willard Richards.We very soon had a pleasant interviewwith Elder Willard Richards, who had remained in Preston to take care of the Church, while the rest had returned home to America.We spent three days at Preston in visiting the Saints, and on the 17th weheld a council at Elder Richards' homein that place.After consulting upon the best coursefor us to pursue, it was finally resolved that Elder John Taylor and Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool, Elder Wood-ruff to Staffordshire Potteries, Theodore Turley to Birmingham, Elder Richards wherever the Spirit might direct him,[Column 2]and that William Clayton preside overthe branch in Manchester.After various principles of the Churchhad been expounded by the Apostles present, the council adjourned.Elder Willard Richards had been called to be one of the quorum of theTwelve Apostles, but had not yet re-ceived his ordination.On the day following I parted withElders Taylor and Fielding, who wentto Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley and I went to Manchester.It was the first time I ever visited that city. I here first met with Elder Wm. Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-tion to him, he informed me that one of the sisters in that place was possessed of the devil, and he asked me to go and cast it out of her, thinking that one of the Twelve Apostles could do anythingin this line he might wish to.However, I went with him to the house where the woman lay, in the hands of three men, in a terrible rage, and trying to tear her clothing from her.I also found quite a number of Saints present, and some unbelievers, who had come to see the devil cast out and amiracle wrought.If I had acted upon my own judg-ment I should not have attempted to ad-minister to her with the company pres-ent, but as I was a stranger there, and Brother Clayton presided over the branch, I joined him in administering to the woman. But the unbelief of the wicked present was so great, we could not cast the devil out of her, and she raged worse than ever.I then ordered the room to be cleared, and when the company left the house, except the few attending to her, we laid hands upon her, and I commanded the devil to come out of her, in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and she was entirely cured and fell asleep.The next day being the Sabbath, she came before a large congregation of peo-ple, and bore testimony to what the Lord had done for her. We had a largeassemblage through the day and evening, to whom I preached the gospel.On Monday morning, the devil, not being satisfied with being cast out of thewoman, entered into her little child, which was but a few months old. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]I was called upon to visit the child. I found it in great distress, writhingin its mother's arms. We laid hands uponit and cast the devil out of it, and the evil spirits had no power over the house-hold afterwards.This was done by the power of God, and not of man. We laid hands upontwenty in Manchester who were sick, and they were mostly healed.On the 21st, I arrived in Burslem by coach, and met, for the first time, withElder Alfred Cordon. This being my field of labor, I stopped and commenced work.Elder Turley stopped in the pottery district some eight days, then went to Birmingham, his field of labor.I received a letter on the 10th of Feb-ruary, from Elder John Taylor, who was at Liverpool, saying they had commenced there and baptized ten persons.I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries, in Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Lane End, and several other villages, from the 22nd, of January until the 2nd of March, preaching every night in the week and two or three times on the Sabbath.I baptized, confirmed and blessed many, and we had a good field open for labor. Many were believing, and it ap-peared as though we had a door open tobring many into the Church in that part of the vineyard.March 1st, 1840, was my birthday, when I was thirty-three years of age. It being Sunday, I preached twice through the day to a large assembly in the City Hall, in the town of Hanley, and ad-ministered the sacrament unto theSaints.In the evening I again met with a largeassembly of the Saints and strangers, and while singing the first hymn the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and the voice of God said to me, "This is the last meeting that you will hold with this peo-ple for many days."I was astonished at this, as I had many appointments out in that district.When I arose to speak to the people, I told them that it was the last meeting I should hold with them for many days. They were as much astonished as I was.At the close of the meeting four persons came forward for baptism, and we went down into the water and bap-tized them.[Column 2]In the morning I went in secret beforethe Lord, and asked Him what His will was concerning me.The answer I got was, that I should go to the south, for the Lord had a great work for me to perform there, as many souls were waiting for the word of theLord.On the 3rd of March, 1840, in fulfill-ment of the word of the Lord to me, I took coach and rode to Wolverhampton,twenty-six miles, and spent the nightthere.On the morning of the 4th I again took coach, and rode through Dudley, Stourbridge, Stourport and Worcester, and then walked a number of miles to Mr. John Benbow's, Hill Farm, Castle Frome, Ledbury, Herefordshire. This was a farming country in the south of England, a region where no Elder of theLatter-day Saints had visited.I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy farmer, cultivating three hundred acresof land, occupying a good mansion, andhaving plenty of means. His wife, Jane, had no children.I presented myself to him as a mission-ary from America, an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who had been sent to him by the commandment of God as a messenger of salvation, to preach the gospel of life unto him and his household, and the in-habitants of the land.Mr. Benbow and his wife received me with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It was in the evening when I arrived, hav-ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach and on foot during the day, but afterreceiving refreshments we sat down to-gether, and conversed until two o'clockin the morning.Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoiced greatly at the glad tidings which I brought unto them of the fulness of theeverlasting gospel, which God had re-vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,Joseph Smith, in these last days.I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.Benbow gave me, that there was a company of men and women—over six hundred in number—who had broken off from the Wesleyan Methodists, and takenthe name of United Brethren. They had forty-five preachers among them, and had chapels and many houses that 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]were licensed according to the law of theland for preaching in.This body of United Brethren weresearching for light and truth, but had gone as far as they could, and were con-tinually calling upon the Lord to open the way before them, and send them light and knowledge that they mightknow the true way to be saved.When I heard these things I could clearly see why the Lord had command-ed me, while in the town of Hanley, to leave that place of labor and go to the south, for in Herefordshire there was a great harvest-field for gathering many Saints into the kingdom of God.I retired to my bed with joy after offering my prayers and thanksgiving to God, and slept sweetly until the rising of the sun.I arose on the morning of the 5th, took breakfast, and told Mr. Benbow I would like to commence my Master's business, by preaching the gospel to the people.He had a large hall in his mansion which was licensed for preaching, and hesent word through the neighborhood that an American missionary would preach at his house that evening.As the time drew nigh many of the neighbors came in, and I preached myfirst gospel sermon in the house. I also preached on the following evening at thesame place, and baptized six persons, including Mr. John Benbow and his wife,and four preachers of the United Brethren.I spent most of the following day in clearing out a pool of water, and preparing it for baptizing in, as I sawmany to be baptized there. I afterwardsbaptized six hundred in that pool of water.On Sunday, the 8th, I preached at Frome's Hill in the morning, at Stand-ley Hill in the afternoon, and at John Benbow's, Hill Farm, in the evening.The parish church that stood in the neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, pre-sided over by the rector of the parish, was attended during the day by only fif-teen persons, while I had a large congre-gation, estimated to number a thousand, attend my meeting through the day andevening.When I arose in the evening to speak at Brother Benbow's house, a man en-tered the door and informed me that he[Column 2]was a constable, and had been sent bythe rector of the parish with a warrant to arrest me.I asked him "For what crime?"He said, "For preaching to the peo-ple."I told him that I, as well as the rec-tor, had a license for preaching the gos-pel to the people, and that if he would take a chair I would wait upon him aftermeeting.He took my chair and sat beside me. I preached the first principles of theeverlasting gospel for an hour and a quarter. The power of God rested upon me, the Spirit filled the house, and the people were convinced.At the close of the meeting I openeda door for baptism, and seven offeredthemselves. Among the number were four preachers and the constable.The latter arose and said, "Mr. Wood-ruff, I would like to be baptized."I told him I would like to baptize him. I went down to the pool and bap-tized the seven. We then met together and I confirmed thirteen, and broke bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced together.The constable went to the rector and told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff taken up for preaching the gospel, hemust go himself and serve the writ, for he had heard him preach the only truegospel sermon he had ever listened to in his life.The rector did not know what to make of it, so he sent two clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meet-ing, and find out what we did preach.But they were both pricked in their hearts and received the word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and con-firmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.The rector became alarmed and did not dare to send anybody else.The ministers and rectors of the South of England called a convention and sent a petition to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to request parliament topass a law prohibiting the Mormons from preaching in the British dominion.In this petition the rector stated that one "Mormon" missionary had baptized fifteen hundred persons, mostly membersof the English church, during the last seven months. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]But the archbishop and council, know-ing well that the laws of England gavefree toleration to all religions under the British flag, sent word to the petitionersthat if they had the worth of souls at heart as much as they had the ground where hares, foxes and hounds ran, they would not lose so many of their flock.I continued to preach and baptize daily.On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder Thomas Kingston. He was super-intendent of both preachers and members of the United Brethren.The first thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire, I had baptized forty-five preachers and one hundred and sixty members of the United Brethren, who put into my hands one chapel and forty-five houses, which were licensed according to law to preach in.This opened a wide field for labor, and enabled me to bring into the Church, through the blessings of God, over eighteen hundred souls during eightmonths, including all of the six hundred United Brethren except one person; also including some two hundred preachersof various denominations.This field of labor embraced Hereford-shire, Gloucestershire and Worcester-shire, and formed the conference of Gar-way, Gadfield Elm and Frome's Hill.I was visited by President Young and Dr. Richards.Brother Benbow furnished us with £300 to print the first Book of Mor-mon that was published in England: and on the 20th of May, 1840, Brigham Young, Willard Richards and I held acouncil on the top of Malvern Hill, and there decided that Brigham Young godirect to Manchester and publish 3,000copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000 copies of the Book of Mormon, thisbeing the first publication of these booksin England.The power of God rested upon us and upon the mission.The sick were healed, devils were cast out, and the lame were made to walk.One case I will mention: Mary Pitt, who died in Nauvoo, sister to Wm. Pitt, who died in Salt Lake City, had not walked upon her feet for eleven years. We carried her into the water and I bap-tized her.On the evening of the 18th of May,[Column 2]1840, at Brother Kingston's house in Dymock, Elders Brigham Young, Wil-lard Richards and I laid hands upon herhead and confirmed her.Brigham Young, being mouth, re-buked her lameness, and commandedher to arise and walk, in the name ofthe Lord. The lameness then left her, and she never afterwards used a staff or crutch.She walked through the town of Dy-mock next day, which created a stiramong the people; but the wicked didnot feel to give God the glory.The whole history of this Hereford-shire mission shows the importance of listening to the still small voice ot the Spirit of God and the revelations of theHoly Ghost.The Lord had a people there prepared for the gospel. They were preparing forlight and truth, and the Lord sent me tothem, and I declared the gospel of life and salvation unto them, and some eighteen hundred souls received it, and many of them have been gathered to Zion in these mountains. Many of themhave also been called to officiate in thebishopric, and have done much good in Zion. But in all these things we should ever acknowledge the hand of God, and give Him the honor, praise and glory, forever and ever. Amen.On the 17th of August 1840, I tookthe parting hand of the Saints in Here-fordshire and started on a mission to London, in company with Apostles Heber C. Kimball and George A.Smith. We rode from Leigh to Chel-tenham, where we tarried for the nightand in the morning took coach and rodeforty miles through a most delightful country, which everywhere wore the golden hue of a plentiful harvest, passedthrough Oxfordshire, in sight of Stowe, the family residence of the Duke of Buckingham, and at Farmington Station, took train for London where we arrivedat 4 p. m. We changed conveyanceto the center of the city by omnibus, walked across London Bridge into the Borough, and called upon Mrs. Allgoodthe sister of Elder Theodore Turley's wife. She treated us with kindness, gave us refreshments and then directed us to a public house, the King's Arms, King Street, Borough. Here we tarried for the night. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]We were now in England's great met-ropolis to sound to it the first procla-mation of the Latter-day Work: for HeberC. Kimball, George A. Smith, and my-self were the three first elders in Londonto preach the Gospel and establish theChurch of Latter-day Saints.We took a walk into the city, passed London Bridge twice, and returned and spent the night at the King's Arms.On the following day we called upon the Rev. J. E. Smith, Lin-coln's Inn Fields, also visited JohnPye, 16 Curiosity Street, ChanceryLane. He was a strong believer in theprophecies of Joanna Southcott and was one of the society. We then returned and had a view of St. Paul's Cathedral, the largest in the world except St. Peter's at Rome. We crossed London Bridge, took tea at 19 King Street, and then went to Union Chapel, Waterloo Road, and heard a comical sermon delivered by an Aitkenite preacher. I spent the night at 58 King Street at Mrs. Loftus.The next day, August the 21st, was the most interesting sight-seeing day in my life, as far as viewing the splendid works of man. I started in company of Elders Heber C. Kimball and GeorgeA. Smith for a walk over the City of London. We crossed London Bridge,passed through King William Street, and several other streets, and visitedCovent Garden; then through St. Mar-tin Street and Court, Leicester Square, Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Pica-dilly, Glass House Street and through most of Regent Street,—one of the most splendid streets in the world. We passed through Langham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire naked from its base to the top, then through Oxford Street, and returned by way of St. Paul's, ending our sight-seeing of the day by visiting the noted monument erected in commemoration of the greatfire in London in 1666, and built underthe direction of that famous architect, Sir Christopher Wren. We entered a door at its base, paid six pence on enter-ing, and ascended three hundred and forty-five black marble steps, whichbrought us up two hundred feet into theair and about one hundred feet higher than the highest houses. We stepped onthe outside of the pillar, which is sur-rounded by an iron railing, and here we[Column 2]had presented to our view an indescrib-able scenery on every hand of the great-est city in the world, which can boast of a history of nearly two thousand years. At our feet, as it were, lay a historical panorama, stretching out to our view around.We were situated so as to overlook nearly every part of the city. East of us lay the ancient Tower of London; east of us also lay the Mint; north the Mansion House of the Lord Mayor of London; north-west, St. Paul's Church; west, Westminster Abbey and the Houseof Parliament; south lies the River Thames with five of the large bridgesacross in full view and one not seen fromthe Monument, making six. These six bridges are fine sights in themselves. They are the architectural monumentsof the Thames, and our view of them from our high pinnacle with their crowdsof moving and ever changing human masses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages,drays, etc., which dash along, presented to us a picturesque sight. In additionto all this, within our view, was LondonBorough, on the south of the river, and all around us hundreds of churches, chapels, and spires, standing in the midst of one universal mass of buildings,covering about six square miles of ground. While viewing this prospect ona clear day, we conversed with a Prussian traveler, a citizen of Berlin, who had traveled much over Europe and Asia andother parts of the world, and he declared that we could not find another spot on the face of the earth that would presentto our view so grand a scenery as the one before us.August 23rd we went to Zion's chapel and heard the celebrated Rev. Robert Aitken preach two sermons. He de-livered a powerful warning to the Gentiles, and presented some of themost sublime truths I ever heard from a sectarian priest; but he was building without the foundation.On the 24th we removed our lodgingsto Mr. Robert Merryfields, No. 15 Gloucester Row, Grange Road, where we obtained a room for all three of us.On the 25th of August we attended a meeting of the Temperance Society, at their hall, which we engaged, but could not have it until the 7th of the next month. Brother Smith made a short 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]speech. On the following day, westarted out to try to get some doors opened for preaching. Brother Kimballwent to one part of the city and BrotherSmith and myself to another. We called upon two Baptist ministers and asked one for his chapel. In the evening we attended a Methodist meeting in Long Lane.Next day we again went to the Tem-perance Hall, in St. George's Road near the Elephant and Castle, and by the re-request of the committee I addressed themeeting upon the subject of temperance,followed by George A Smith. We gaveout an appointment to preach the Gos-pel at that place September 7th.The day after, we all started out to gothrough the city of London to see if we could find a man with the Spirit of God,and after wandering through the city, not knowing whither we went, we cameupon a man and stopped him and spoketo him. Brother Kimball asked himif he was a preacher? He said he was. He seemed to have a good spirit, and informed us that he had beento America, and had come to Londonfor the purpose of going to South Aus-tralia, but had just buried one child and another lay at the point of death. Broth-er Kimball told him his child should live. He gave us some information where we could preach. On the sameday we called upon him and found his child better, but he was not at home. We then went and heard a Calvinist preach, and he gave us an invitation tocall and see him.Next day we again went over the cityto see if we could find any of the chil-dren of God. We found one man and his household who received our testi-mony, and he opened his doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his house for Sunday evening. His name was Corner, and he lived at 52 Iron-monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, nearthe church.We had spent twelve days in going to and fro through London, trying to finda people willing to receive our testi-mony, but finding the doors shut against us, we determined in the name of God to go into the streets and lift up ourvoices.Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith, and myself started out on Sunday morn-[Column 2]ing, August the 30th, walked three miles and stopped in Tabernacle Square, Old Street, where we found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who was fol-lowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about to begin, Elder Kimballinformed him that there was a preacherfrom America present who would like tospeak when he got through. The preacher then informed the people that there was an American minister present, and pro-posed that he should speak first. Elder George A. Smith then got into the chair,and spoke about twenty minutes, andthen the Presbyterian spoke. George A.had informed the people that there weretwo other American preachers present who would like to address them, and, when the Presbyterian closed, Elder Kimball asked him if there would be any objection to our preaching there at threeo'clock. He answered, "No, not at all. What denomination do you belong to?'' "To the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints," was the reply."Oh, I have heard of them," he said."They are a bad people; they have done much hurt; they divide churches; we don't want to hear you."He then mounted the chair again and said to the people, "I have just heardthat the last man who spoke belongs tothe Latter-day Saints," and he began torail against us.Elder Kimball asked him to let him step into the chair to give out an ap-pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, buthe would not let him. Brother Kimball then raised his voice and informed thepeople that some American preachers would preach there at 3 o'clock.At the appointed time we were at the place. The conduct of the preacher andthe excitement upon the subject brought a large congregation to hear us. I opened the meeting by singing andprayer and spoke about twenty minutes, from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. I. 8-9 v.##, and was followed by Elder Kimball for about the same length of time. The people gave good attentionand seemed to be much interested in what they heard.After meeting, Mr. Corner invited ushome; but soon after we arrived, at his house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to return to the place of preaching. When he got there he found a large company talking about the things which they had 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]heard, and they wished him to speak to them again. He did so and addressedthem at considerable length, and after-ward several invited him home to their houses.While he was away a man who had been a preacher came to Mr. Corner's; I gave him a brief account of the great work of God in the last days and they received the things which I spake untothem. Mr. Corner offered himself for baptism. This was the first man in the city of London who offered himself forthe ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-pointed the next evening to administerthe ordinance of baptism unto him.After supping with him we returned home. I was weary and unwell duringthe night, but felt thankful unto the Lord for the privilege of preaching tothe inhabitants of this great city and tohave gained one soul as a seal to our ministry.On the 31st of August we reaped the first fruits of our labors and laid the first living stone of the Church of Jesus Christin England's great metropolis.We walked into the city and called upon Mr. Corner, who went forwardwith us to the public baths and receivedthe initiatory ordinance of the Gospel.He was baptized by Brother Kimball.Returning to the house of BrotherCorner, Elders Kimball, Smith and my-self laid our hands upon his head andconfirmed him a member or the Church. We returned to our homes that night, thankful unto God for his goodness inblessing our labors even thus much.On the 2nd of September I was quiteill. I had been unwell for several days, but now I was obliged to keep to my room; but Elders Kimball and Smith went into the city to visit the people and found some who hearkened to them favor-ably. We had by this time found that London was the hardest place for a mis-sion that we had ever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in the least, and were determined in the name of theLord to set up the standard of the King-dom in that city.The following day I was still confinedto my room most of the time, but onthe next, Elders Kimball and Smith went to Debtford, and I took a walk into the city, called upon Brother Corner and found him in good spirits. I also called[Column 2]upon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,Basin, who was a director of a Methodistchapel. I asked him for the chapel to preach in. He said he had a school house which would hold two hundred, and that I might have that on Sunday. So I gave out an appointment at Bowl Court, 137 Shordeitch. I conversed with several others who received my tes-timony, and one woman said she wouldbe baptized.Sunday, September the 6th, I preached in the morning at Bowl Court, 137Shoreditch, and was followed by EldersKimball and Smith. We also held a meeting in Tabernacle Square, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, at which EldersKimball and Smith preached and I bore my testimony to their words. One man arose and opposed us, and was angry be-cause of the truth of God. He continued opposing, until the police stopped the conversation.We met again in the evening at Bowl Court, to preach to the people, but when we got there we found a plan con-trived by several of the preachers for one of them to preach, lest some should believe our testimony. We went our way and found four persons who re-ceived our testimony and offered them-selves for baptism.Next day I wrote to Elder Browett of my Herefordshire field of labor, and walked to Brother Corner's and visited several other friends. Two offered them-selves for baptism. I visited St. Paul's and then returned home. Elders Kim-ball and Smith had just returned from avisit to the Rev. Robert Aitken. He received them kindly, acknowledgedtheir doctrine true, but was afraid of deception. His mind was in a disturbed state.In the evening we held a meeting inthe Temperance Hall; but we had al-most the bare walls to preach to, there being only about thirty present. I preached to the few present for about anhour, and Elder Kimball followed me. After paying seven shillings and six pence for the use of the hall we returned to our lodgings.On September the 9th I paid my bills and called upon the friends, in company of Brothers Kimball and Smith, and onthe day following I parted from the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE[Column 1]brethren and friends in London to re-turn to Herefordshire.We had spent twenty-three days in that great Babylon of modern times and had found it harder to establish the Church there than in any place wherewe had ever been. We had baptizedone man, and ordained him a priest; and six others had given in their namesto be baptized on the following Sunday; and at this time there was some little prospect of the Rev. Robert Aitken re-ceiving the work. I, therefore, left London feeling that our mission andlabors had not been altogether in vain.I was rejoiced on my return to the churches to find that the work was uni-versally and rapidly progressing in Here-fordshire. In some cases it was even reaching the nobility, and a lady of title had become convinced of the work of God through our ministry.Lady Roberts was of the nobility of England and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawn from the Church of England and had traveled much in search of truthlooking for the fulfillment of the Pro-phets.She became acquainted with the ful-ness of the Gospel through a femaleservant in the employ of Squire Dowds-well. She began to investigate the sub-ject; the Spirit of God rested upon herand convinced her of the truth of the work. She obtained the four numbers published of the Millennial Star, and, fearing that she should not be able to obtain them for herself, copied the whole of them with her pen. She also read the Book of Mormon and copied a part of that, and became perfectly con-vinced of the truth of the work of which she read, and said she would go athousand miles but what she would see some of the Twelve and be baptized under their hands. Hearing that I was in London she was about to take a journey there to see me, and the otherbrethren, and be baptized. She had two brothers, ministers of the Church of England.On the 21st of September, 1840, we held the Frome's Hill Conference, at which were represented 24 churches, with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,9 teachers and 1 deacon. The Bran Green and Frome's Hill Conferenceswere now composed of 40 churches,[Column 2]1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests, 15 teachers and one deacon.These two conferences, with theirforty branch churches, and over a thou-sand organized members, under the di-rection of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers, had been raised upwithin six months and a half. Surelythe work of Godhad been marvelous, unparalleled perhaps in the history ofany new religious movement.I meditated upon these things, and in my journal of date September 21st, 1840, I wrote thus:"This has been a busy day with me.After standing upon my feet from morn-ing till evening I am called to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with gladhearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinary feelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact that a thousand souls have been baptized into the newand everlasting covenant in about half a year in one field which God has enabledme to open. I pray him to accept thegratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessings unto me in this thing, andenable me to stand with these Saintsand all the righteous in His celestial kingdom."This day I had stood upon my feet eight hours in conference, conversed much of the time in suggesting, speak-ing, motioning, etc.; ordained aboutthirty, confirmed some, healed many who were sick, shook hands with aboutfour hundred Saints, walked two miles,and ended with about four hours chim-ney corner preaching. I then laid downto rest and dreamt of catching fish.The church ministers at this time were very much stirred up in this region be-cause of the success of the work of Godin the midst of the people, and every exertion was made by them to stay itsprogress. They were finding that the Lord was delivering their flocks out oftheir hands and giving them unto the shepherds of the Church of the Saints. They were alarmed and were holding conventions and meetings to contriveplans and adopt means to overthrow thelatter-day work of God, which they un-derstood not, and believed not, yet feared its power. And well indeed theymight, for in some instances they did not have more than ten or fifteen at their 
 [Column 1]churches on the Sabbath, while aroundthem on every hand they had seen fortybranches of two organized conferences of the Church of Latter-day Saints spring up in about six months, with overa thousand members and between one and two hundred officers ordained toscatter the seed of the Gospel every-where in this prolific field.On the 25th, I again took leave of the Saints in my Herefordshire field of labor[Column 2]to attend the conference at Staffordshire, which was held at Hanley.The day after the conference I bap-tized one and preached at Tunstell, and on the next evening at Burslem to a crowded audience, and the power ofGod rested upon me. Great solemnity pervaded the congregation. The Spirit of God was moving the people and theyfelt that the Lord was doing a work intheir midst.-[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]CHAPTER III.CONTINUATION OF MY MISSION TO ENG-LAND. ORGANIZATION OF THE LON-DON CONFERENCE. I BID FAREWELLTO THE HEREFORDSHIRE SAINTS. RETURN TO AMERICA.On the 6th of October, 1840, a general conference of the British mission was held at Manchester. There were present of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard Rich-ards, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith and Wilford Woodruff. The presiding officers of the mission represented twenty-sevenconferences, besides other churches notyet organized into conferences. Thenumber of membership was 3,621, being an increase since the last general con-ference of 1,113 members.The next evening we attended a dis-cussion held between a sectarian minister and Elder Alfred Cordon on the subject of the Book of Mormon. There were present 1,500 people. This was the first discussion of any note on Mormonismheld in Great Britain.I left Manchester on the 14th of Octoberto return to my labors in London; and on my way, with Elder Alfred Cordon,I visited the Staffordshire Potteries and Birmingham. On the 17th I arrived in London, where I found Elder George A.Smith, and we were glad to meet each other once again.We hired lodgings, board and sitting room at No. 40 Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's. Everything was dear, and we found with the greatest economy we could not do with much less than a pound per week each. What few Saints there were in London were very poor and[Column 2]unable to assist us. Most of the means used in my labors in London was sup-plied by my converts of Herefordshire.The prospect in London at that time was the darkest I had ever been in sinceentering the vineyard, but the Lord waswith us and we were not discouraged.Sunday we met with the Saints at Brother Corner's three times, read in the Book of Mormon, gave instruction andbroke bread unto them. We had a good time, though there was only about half a dozen present. I felt the spirit beartestimony that there would be a workdone in London.I fell asleep, having retired to rest in good season, and slept until midnight,when I awoke and meditated upon thethings of God until 3 o'clock in the morn-ing, and while forming a determinationto warn the people in London and over-come the power of darkness by the assist-ance of God, a person appeared unto me whom I consider was the prince of dark-ness. He made war upon me and at-tempted to take my life. He caught me by the throat and nearly choked me to death.He wounded me in my forehead and I also wounded him in a number of placesin the head. As he was about to over-come me I prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ for help. I thenhad power over him and he left me,though much wounded. Afterwardsthree persons dressed in white came to me and prayed with me and I was im-mediately healed of all my wounds anddelivered of all my troubles.During the following week we visitedthe British Museum and other notableplaces, and also attended a Wesleyan Methodist mission meeting over whichthe Lord Mayor presided; while in the 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]performance of our own missionarylabors we circulated and posted hand-bills. The following is a copy of thefirst placard of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints posted inEngland's great metropolis."He that judgeth a matter before he heareth isnot wise."THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS meet for pub-lic worship at Mr. J. Barrett's Academy,57 King's Square, Goswell Road—(en-trance door in President Street) every Sabbath at 3 and half past 6 o'clock p. m.;also on Tuesday and Thursday Evenings, each week at 8 o'clock.LECTURESwill be delivered by Elders Woodruffand Smith (late from America), who re-spectfully invite the citizens of Londonto attend.The first principles of the EverlastingGospel in its fullness. The gathering ofIsrael. The second coming of the Savior and "the restitution of all things'' spokenof by all the holy prophets, will be among the subjects illustrated.The Latter-day Saints Millenial Star, published monthly, and other publicationscan be had at 52 Ironmonger Row, St.Luke's. (City press, Long Lane, Doud-ney & Seryngour.) The following Sunday we preached forthe first time in Barrett's Academy at3 o'clock. There were present about fifty persons, unto whom I preached and Elder Smith preached in the evening; but it was the hardest matter to awakenan interest upon the subject that I had ever found.Next day I received a package of lettersfrom America, one from my wife an-nouncing the death of my little daughter,Sarah Emma.There is so much going on in this great modern Babylon to draw the attention of the people that it seemed almost to re-quire the trumpet's blast from heaven to awaken the attention of the inhabitantsto our proclamation of the restoration of the fullness of the Gospel.We were here like the Apostles of oldwithout purse or script to warn the Cityof London, where we had to pay highfor everything we required, and to payfor a place to preach in. We were atthis time about out of money, but stillwe felt to trust in God.[Column 2]November 1st I preached in the after-noon in the Academy to about thirty, and in the evening to about fifty. We broke bread unto the Saints, and thisevening there seemed to be some interest manifested in inquiring into the work.We preached again on the following Sunday. During the week we receivedcounsel from our brethren of the Twelvefor George A. Smith to go immediatelyto the Potteries and spend his time with the churches there. After his departureI felt very lonely for several days, butElder William Pitt from Dymock came and labored with me for a short time,after which he took a mission to Ipswich.Brother Hulme, a captain of one of the "Pickford's Boats" on the London Canal, was present at my next preachingafter the departure of Elder Pitt, and with him were two of his hands whomhe had baptized. On the following dayI dined with him and the two brethrenon board their boat.On the afternoon and evening of Sun-day, the 22nd of October, I held publicmeeting at the Academy, when four offered themselves for baptism; and onthe following Sunday I again preachedtwice and baptized and confirmed threemore. These were the first fruits of mylabors in London.Next day I took a very interestingwalk with Dr. Wm. Copeland through every part of the College of Surgeons atLincoln's Inn Fields, and on my returnhome I was soon joined by Elders Brig-ham Young and Kimball, who had come to spend a week or two in London. This was the first time ever President BrighamYoung was in the metropolis of Eng-land.We met for service at the Academy Wednesday evening, when Brother Brig-ham preached, followed by Brother Heber. We had a good time.In company with Presidents Young and Kimball on the 3rd of December I visited the Tower of London, without seeing which the traveler would lose a capital page of the history of his travelsin Europe, and during the week also visited St. Paul's, Buckingham Palace,Westminster Abbey, the Queen's stables, and saw many other noted sights of London.Sunday we held public meeting at the 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]Academy, at which there were about fiftypresent. Brother Kimball preached.An Independent minister invited mehome to take tea with him. I accepted his invitation, had an interesting timeand preached the Gospel to him and hereceived my testimony and offered me hischapel, which would hold 800. He said hethought he would be baptized and wouldtry and get his society to do the same.We met again in the evening and had more at our meeting than ever before.Brother Brigham Young preached and was followed by Brothers Kimball, Wil-liams, Corner, Hulme and myself.We had a very interesting time and one offered himself for baptism. Therewere some of the Aikenites present, one of whom purchased a hymn book. They wished us to call upon them and thoughtthey would be baptized. We then met at Father Corner's and communed withthe Saints and had a good time.I rejoiced at the prospect which was opening before us, for we labored a long time and the work had gone slow, but now a wide opening was being made to roll on the work of the Lord in the me-tropolis of England.Having spent about ten days in Lon-don President Young left for Cheltenham.On the same day I visited Mr. James Albon, a minister of the Independentorder, who with his household believed our doctrine, and on the Sunday we found more than ever an interest being awak-ened in London, and our prayer meetingthe next evening was attended by the Reverend James Albon, who received our testimony. We walked home with him and found his household growing in the faith and ready for the work of the Lord.Two days after in the evening we bap-tized four, two of whom were Mr. andMrs Morgan, with whom we lodged, Christopher, Smith their apprentice, andHenry Corner, Jun.The afternoon of the following dayDr. Copeland spent with us, and he re-ceived our testimony, and in the evening we preached at our meeting place.I had visited the Rev. James Albon several times and given him an account of the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He believed in our mission and offered me his chapel to preach in, which would seat about a thousand.[Column 2]Sunday morning we accompanied our reverend friend and convert to his chapeland were introduced to the committee, one of whom was a preacher who hadtraveled much in Russia and other parts of the world. At the close of the meet-ing the Rev. James Albon gave out an appointment for us to preach on the next Sabbath evening.In the afternoon we met with theSaints, confirmed four and had a full house, and in the evening we preachedagain and a good feeling prevailed.After meeting the Rev. James Albon called upon us at our room and told us that he had given out our appointmentto preach in his chapel and had informedhis congregation that he was a Latter-day Saint, and should be baptized and join our Church, and that they need notlonger consider him a member of their body unless they with him joined theSaints. He told us this made a division among the committee; some were for going with him and some against follow-ing their pastor into the true fold which he had found.The Sunday following in the evening we preached, by the appointment of itsminister, in the Independent chapel tothe largest congregation we had ever dis-coursed before in London. There were  present priests and people of many de-nominations. I addressed them forabout the space of one hour. A Wes-leyan minister arose and opposed me,which had a good effect, for the congre-gation seeing the spirit he was of turned against him, and the committee refused him the permission to speak there any more. I was much bound by the oppos-ing spirit, still the conduct of the enemy gave us friends.The next evening we attended what was said to have been the largest temper-ance meeting ever held in London, and the next two days brought us to theclose of the year.SYNOPSISof the Travels and Labors of Wilford Woodruff, in 1840.Places Visited or Labored in—Liver-pool, Preston, Manchester, Newcastle,Tunstell, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Long-ton, Stafford, Wolverhampton, Birming-ham, Worcester, Hereford, Ledbury, 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]Malvern Hill, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Oxford, London. Traveled 4,469 miles; held 230 meetings, and established 53places for preaching; I planted 47 churches and jointly organized them.These churches were chiefly comprisedin the two conferences raised up in Here-fordshire, consisting of about 1,500 Saints, 28 elders, no priests, 24 teachers, and 10 deacons.The baptisms of the year were three hundred and thirty-six persons under my own hands, and I assisted in the baptismof eighty-six others. I baptized 57 preachers, mostly of the connection of the United Brethren, and also 2 clerks ofthe Church of England. I confirmed 420, and assisted in confirming 50 others.I ordained 18 elders, 97 priests, 34 teachers and 1 deacon. I blessed 120 children, and administered to 120 sick by prayer, anointing and the laying on of hands, and in many instances the sick were healed, and devils cast out. I assisted in procuring £1,000 for the pub-lication of 3,000 copies of the hymn book, 5,000 copies of the Book of Mor-mon, and for the printing of the Mil-lennial Star, and to assist two hundredSaints to emigrate to Nauvoo. I wrote 200 letters and received 112.The new year, 1841, found Elder Kimball and myself in the metropolis of England in the enjoyment of good health. We celebrated New Year's dayby baptizing two into the fold of Christ. The church in London now numberedtwenty-one members.The next Sunday we held a meeting inthe Academy, confirmed two, and par-took of the sacrament.During the week I baptized the daughter of the Rev. James Albon, and the day after Elder Kimball started to Woolwich to break up new ground. Onthe Sunday he preached there for the first time, when four persons offered themselves for baptism. Next day theycame to London, and we immediately repaired to our private bath in Taber-nacle Square, and Elder Kimball bap-tized five persons, one of whom was Dr. Wm. Copeland.This was indeed an interesting occa-sion and we felt thankful to God to seethe cloud beginning to break, for we had struggled hard to do the little which had been done.[Column 2]On the 15th of the month we baptized three more of Brother Morgan's house-hold, and on the following Sunday I preached to a full house and to manynew hearers. Several offered themselves for baptism, and there had been during the week added unto the Church seven souls.Next day Elder Kimball received a letter from Elder Young, who wished usto be ready to set sail for home early in April.Several days later I baptized the Rev. James Albon and Mr. Hender, and be-fore the close of January I baptized threeothers into the Church.I visited Greenwich and Woolwich, where Elder Kimball had raised up a small branch of the Church. I returnedto London with Elder Kimball. On the Sunday we communed with the Saints,and in the evening we both preached toa full congregation.On the 8th of February, having re-ceived a package of twenty Books of Mormon and two dozen hymn books.Heber C. Kimball and myself went to Stationer's Hall and secured the copy-right of the Book of Mormon in the name of Joseph Smith, Jr. We left five copies of the book, and paid three shil-lings for the copyright.In the evening we baptized four per-sons, one of whom was the wife of Rev. James Albon, who had already received the Gospel.Elder Brigham Young, per letter, in-formed us of the large emigration ofthat season. There were to go on one ship 235, and on another 100.To the reader acquainted with the im-mense emigrations of the Saints in later years, our consideration of the sailing of three or four hundred as a large emigra-tion will be noteworthy.Elder Lorenzo Snow arrived in Lon-don on the 11th, to take charge of the Church after our departure. I was trulyglad to once more greet him for I had not seen him since 1837.On the same day Elder Wm. Pitt also arrived at our lodgings, and we had aninteresting meeting in the evening. Brother Snow preached, and Elder Kim-ball and myself followed him, and the next day Brothers Heber and Lorenzo went to Woolwich to give impetus to

WM. COPELAND, Clerk.During this Conference meeting we also broke bread with the Saints and con-firmed four. At half-past 6 in the evening, we met again and had the largest con-gregation which had assembled at our preaching place. One came forward forbaptism.This was a day which we had long de-sired to see, for we had labored exceedingly hard to establish a Church in Lon-don and at times it seemed as though weshould have to give it up, but by holding on to the work of our Divine Master and claiming the promises of God, we were now to leave an established London Con-ference with a prosperous Church plantedin the metropolis, under the care of our beloved Brother Lorenzo Snow.Brother Kimball, on the 15th, receiveda letter from his wife, informing us thatthe Prophet Joseph had written for the Twelve to come immediately home.At this time there was a prospect of war between America and England, over the imprisonment of McCloud, a Britishofficer, by the State of New York, and the northeastern boundary question. In consequence of this prospect the Prophet Joseph wrote for the Twelve to come home, after first thoroughly organ-izing the British mission and calling out a number of native elders to send inevery direction throughout Great Britain.I spent the 25th of February in visit-ing the Saints previous to my departure and in the evening preached for the last 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]time in London before my return toNauvoo. Next day I parted from Lor-enzo Snow and the London Saints and took train for Bristol, to visit the branch which had been raised up there by myconvert Elder Thomas Kington, who it will be remembered was the superin-tendent of the Frome's Hill Circuit ofUnited Brethren.Leaving Bristol I visited the churcheswhich I had raised up, for the purpose of holding conferences and bidding farewellto the Saints, hundreds of whom I had myself baptized.When I arrived at Monmouth, Elder James Morgan was waiting my coming, and had given out an appointment forme to preach in the town at 7 o'clock, atthe house of Robert Davis. There was a crowded meeting and many could not getinto the house. Four offered themselvesfor baptism. The Spirit witnessed to methat there would many embrace the Gos-pel in Monmouthshire, and I said, "theharvest is great and the laborers few."I arose in the morning refreshed bysleep, and having taken breakfast with Mr. Matton, I walked ten miles throughmud and water in a driving March rainstorm to sister Mary Morgan at LittleGarway, where I found a pleasant family of the Saints. We were drenched with rain but found a good fire and spent theday comfortably and in the evening I hadan interesting interview with Elder Little-wood; the next day at Sister Morgan's, reading the history of Rome, with muchinterest, and in the evening I met the officers of the Church there in council and had a good time. Sunday I preached inthe morning at the house of BrotherThomas Rood, and in the evening at theKitchen upon the Book of Mormon, and had the place full.The Garway Conference, held March 8th, 1841—I met the Garway conferenceat the Kitchen. Elder Levi Richards waschosen president and Elder James Mor-gan, clerk. There were present one of the Quorum of the Twelve, one High Priest, seven Elders, eleven Priests, twoTeachers and one Deacon. The meeting opened with prayer by Elder Woodruff, after which the churches were representedas follows: Members, 134; Elders, 4;Priests, 5; Teachers, 3; Deacons, 1.After the representation it was moved that John Needham be ordained elder,[Column 2]William Morris priest and Thomas Roughteacher. These were ordained under the hands of Elders Woodruff and Richards.The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock andone person was baptized.In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards spoke and I followed him. After meet-ing the Saints contributed one pound to help me, and sold them three books of Mormon and fifty addresses to the citi-zens of London. I then walked five miles with Brother Richards to Brother Holley's and spent the night. This was the first time I had seen Brother Levi for about two years.Next day in company of Elders LeviRichards and Thomas Pitt I walked to the city of Hereford, where Elder Ray and others had been preaching.On Sunday a preacher arose before two or three thousand people in the markethouse and informed the multitude thathe had a fresh letter direct from America, showing the origin of the Book of Mor-mon. So he read the old Spauldingstory. When he got through Elder Levi Richards arose and informed the peoplethat instead of its being a new story ithad been published for seven years throughout the United States and inEngland. This caused a great uproar, for while some were for driving the man outof the place for lying, others were crowdingaround Elders Richards and Ray to hear them preach. The crowd, however, was so excited that they left the ground with hundreds following them. There never was a time when the people were so muchstirred up and eager to hear the Latter-day Saints as at the present, and it wasexpected that we should not get throughthe city without having crowds aroundus. We did, however, and had a view of Hereford Cathedral as we passed along and reached Sister Bufton's.There was at this time a small branchof the Church at Hereford, numberingseven members. We parted from BrotherPitt at Hereford, and continued to Lug-wardine, where I met with the Church forthe last time and preached from the ##Isaiah 24|24th## of Isaiah.On the morrow I walked to Shucknell Hill and had an interesting meeting withthe Saints and preached upon the gather-ing to Zion and Jerusalem. It was mylast meeting with them and I bid themfarewell. Next day I walked to Standley 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]Hill and dined with Brother Ockey, whomI was truly glad to see once more. We went together through Standley Hill andcalled upon the Saints. Six months hadpassed since I had parted from the churches in this region, but now I was again in the field where the Lord by His blessing and the power of the HolyGhost had made my labors so abundantlyfruitful.Next day I went to Greenway and preached, blessed a child, confirmed amember and administered the ordinanceof the Gospel to five sick persons; andon the morrow continued to Turkey Hill. Here on the Sunday I communed with the saints and preached to a large con-gregation upon the gathering. I foundthe Saints in the region around very de-sirous to gather to the body of the Church, but they were poor and had notthe means.Conference at Gadfield Elm Chapel.— On the 15th day of March, 1841, the Bran Green and Gadfield Elm con-ference again assembled, when the meet-ing was called to order by Elder Wood-ruff.There were present one of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, 1 high priest; 10 elders 21 priests 6 teachers and 1Deacon, besides the congregation of theSaints. There were represented nineteenchurches; 367 members, 8 elders, 33 priests, 11 teachers, 1 deacon, removed41, died 1, expelled 2.WILFORD WOODRUFF, President. JOHN HILL, Clerk.We had a very interesting time at the conference and a large assembly of the Saints. It was the last time that I should attend in that part of my old and beloved field of labor, during my present missionto England, and whether or not I should ever meet here in a conference assembly of Saints again was one of the secrets of my future life for time to reveal. We had held our meeting without disturbancefrom the mob who were present, forthey were kept quiet by the police in at-tendance who were in disguise.No sooner had the meeting closed thanmultitudes of the Saints crowded aroundme and hands were presented me on every side, to bid me farewell. Manycalled for me to bless them before I de-parted. Others cried out, "Lay handsupon me and heal me before you go."[Column 2]One came with, "Brother Woodruff, I am turned out of doors for my religion; what shall I do?'' Another with, "I am ready to go to Zion, but my wife won't go with me; shall I leave her to gather withthe Saints?" A wife in turn says, "My husband beat me and turned me out of doors because I have been baptized. I have money enough to carry me and thechildren to Zion; will you let me go with-out him?" "Brother Woodruff, my mother is over 80 years of age and has willed me 60 pounds at her death, but will not emigrate with me; must I stay for her to die or leave her now to go with the Saints?" One said, "I have sold my little place and shall have 30 pounds to-morrow, but must go out into thestreet. I have not enough to carry myfamily to America; can you help me to a few pounds or tell me what to do?" Andan Elder cried out, "How much longer must I preach in England before you willlet me go to America?" "Brother Wood-ruff, would you come and preach in Chel-tenham?" "My head is in great pain, would you heal me? " "I want you to consecrate this bottle of oil before yougo?" "Will you write to me?" "I have been waiting a long time to get a chance to speak to you; good by, remem-ber me to Mrs. Woodruff, good by! God bless you!''Thus was I for more than an hour after the close of the meeting assailed with the affectionate outbursts and adieus and a host of perplexities of these Saints whocrowded around me as children to theirfather.Many of the Saints parted from mein tears and many followed me to Turkey Hill where I spent the night and they filled the house until a late hour, begging counsel and instruction of me.One of these was a Baptist minister who had just been baptized into the Church.On the morrow, in company with El-der Needham, I walked to Keysend Street, where I preached to a crowded congregation of Saints. On the follow-ing day I walked to Wind Point, whereI visited the Saints, and thence con-tinued to Colwall. Here I met with alarge congregation of Saints and preached to them upon the gathering.Next day, with Elder Levi Richards, I walked over Malvern Hill and called upon Elder Samuel Jones; thence 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.[Column 1]through Great Malvern to Crowcat; I held a meeting at Brother George Brooks'and had an interesting time with a large number of Saints whom I had baptized about a year before. I went to Dunclose the day after, visiting many of the Saintsby the way, laying hands upon the sick, and blessing and counseling others of theflock. They all were happy to see me, for I had baptized most of them when I first opened that field of labor. Next day we traveled to Frome's Hill, and visited the Saints by the way.At Frome's Hill I met with the Saints on Sunday morning, and had a crowded house; in the afternoon we held a meet-ing at Standley Hill, where I communed with the church. At the close of themeeting I had a busy time shaking hands with the Saints and parting from them. Many of them wished me to bless them,and others to heal them. I spent thenight with Brother Levi Richards at Elder Edward Ockey's, and on the mor-row we held the Frome's Hill conferenceat Standley Hill.There were present of the traveling high council, 2 high priests, 20 elders, 30 priests, 9 teachers, and 2 deacons.After calling the meeting to order, I moved that Elder Levi Richards should preside over the conference, and he wassustained by the meeting. I was chosen clerk.After singing and prayer, the presi-dent called upon the officers for the rep-resentation of the various branches, which was given as follows: branches, 33; members, 957; elders, 24; priests, 68; teachers, 27; deacons, 8.Robert Gummery, Edward Philips and John Spires were ordained to the officeof elder, under the hands of Elders Richards, Kington and myself; ThomasBishop to the office of priest, and Wm. Rowley to the office of deacon.In the afternoon, after speeches fromElders Richards and Kington, I delivered my farewell address and pronounced thebenediction on the conference.After the meeting was dismissed, I wasalmost three hours shaking hands withthe Saints, healing the sick and giving counsel to the multitude who surrounded me, many of whom were in tears when we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to askme to take them to Zion, when I had notmeans to take myself. I, however, gave[Column 2]Sister Foxal five pounds to help her and her husband and children to the land of America. She had made every exertion for six months to save money to gather with the Saints, and had raised thirty pounds. The five pounds I gave to herwas a donation from Elder Edward Ockey, who was imparting of his sub-stance to help the poor of the church togather.After bidding the multitude of Saintsfarewell, I went to Elder Ockey's, to spend the night, accompanied by EldersRichards, Kington and Ray.We had been in the house but a short time when three of Edward Ockey's brothers came in for the purpose of hav-a contest, because their brother and sis-ter had embraced the gospel and wasabout to gather with the Saints. They manifested much wrath against me, and, after conversing with them about three hours, they left the house, and we wereonce more in peace.After conversing together until thethird watch of the night, we retired to rest, closing one of the busiest days ofmy life.I arose in the morning, refreshed by sleep, and, after conversing several hours with Elders Richards, Kington, Kay, Ockey and others, I was under the ne-cessity of parting with the Saints in this region.In bidding them farewell I found in our hearts and memory of our associa-tion many ties which bound me to thoseI were leaving behind and among thefaithful ones were the Ockeys.Brother Edward Ockey and his sister Ann were of a good and wealthy family. They had many trials to pass through to do the will of God and to gather with the Saints, for their brothers were exceed-ingly set against them. But Brother Edward had maintained his integrity likea man of God and was making everypreparation to gather with the Saints, buthis sister Ann had fears that her brothers would hinder her gathering.Having bid farewell to the Saints of Standley Hill, I walked to Frome's Hilland conversed with the elders until two o'clock, when I took the parting hands of Elders Richards, Kington, Ray andothers, and with my carpet bag with about 20 pounds weight in it, walked fifteen miles to Worcester in four hours. 
 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.[Column 1]When I arrived there I was so verylame and weary with my heavy load andfast walking that I could scarcely walkat all. I then took rail and arrived inBirmingham at 10 o'clock at night, butwas exceedingly lame and weary. I spent the night with Elder James Riley, 24 Park Street.I had now fairly ended my Hereford-shire mission, and bidden a last farewell to that field of labor where the Lord hadblessed me beyond all my expectations.I now left three conferences in the re-gion which I opened one year before, onthe 5th of the same month that I left this vineyard, planted all over with churches, numbering fifteen hundred Saints.The minutes which I have recorded will show at a glance the rise and pro-gress of the churches in Herefordshire, and the regions around.On Sunday, the 28th of March, the Staffordshire conference met, and there were present of the Twelve, George A. Smith and Wilford Woodruff, with 1 high priest, 13 elders, 28 priests, 10 teachers, and 8 deacons. The confer-ence was held in the Magistrate's Assem-bly Room.At the close of the conference it wasvoted that "this conference grant unto Elders Woodruff and George A. Smith a letter of recommendation manifestingthat the Church in this region accept of their labors and consider that they havefilled their mission with honor and dig-nity."We had a very interesting time on this occasion. The conference was held in aplace which would hold 800 and it was crowded; but there was perfect order and much good feeling manifested dur-ing the day. There was prospect of acontinued increase in the Potteries.George A. Smith was the president of the conference and T. J. Fitcher and O.Shaw, clerks.Next day George A. Smith and my-self met the officers in council at theHanley Meeting Rooms and gave suchadvise as we deemed wisdom, and then took our farewell.On the following day we also parted from the Saints at Burslem, took coachto Manchester, and called upon ParleyP. Pratt, 47 Oxford Street, and foundhim and his family enjoying good health.On the 6th of April, 1841, the general[Column 2]conference of the British mission washeld in Carpenter's Hall, Manchester, atwhich there were present nine of thequorum of the Twelve, namely: Presi-dent Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, OrsonPratt, Willard Richards, Wilford Wood-ruff, John Taylor, and George A. Smith. The total members of the British mission at that time was represented as 5,814, and800 besides had emigrated to Americaunder the shipping arrangements of theChurch. At this conference the Twelveblessed and set apart Orson Hyde for his mission to Jerusalem to which he had been called by the Prophet Joseph.This was the first and only time in this dispensation that the Twelve Apostles sat in conference as a quorum in a foreign land.Immediately after the general confer-ence, those of the Twelve who were about to return home hastened to Liver-pool and embarked for America on the 20th of April, on board of the shipRochester. Next day, the wind beingfavorable, the ship weighed anchor. There were on board Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, Willard Richards and John Taylor, of the Twelve, with Elder Reuben Hedlock and 120 ofthe British Saints.On our passage across the Atlantic we had some very tempestuous weather and became familiar with "a storm at sea."On the 20th of May we landed in New York, and on the next day George A. Smith and myself took up our abode for a few days at Brother Foster's. While here I met my brothers-in-law, Ezra and llus Carter, and also Dr. Charles Fabyan, my wife's relative.On the 22nd of May, at the house of Brother Foster and in the presence of the quorum of the Twelve, I performed the service of marriage between Mr. Edward Ockey and Miss Eliza Brewer, both of them my converts of Castle Frome. This was the first marriage ceremony at which I officiated.On the 2nd of June I arrived at Scarborough per stage, and was per-mitted to embrace my wife, and also my first born son, whom I had not beforeseen. After two years of separationfrom my wife, it was a happy reunion indeed. Here I staged with my father- 
 [Column 1]in-law until the 5th of July, and thenleft for my native place, Farmington,where I arrived the third day after.While tarrying at my father's house Imarried my sister Eunice Woodruff toMr. Dwight Webster. At my sister'smarriage there were between forty andfifty persons, mostly our relatives. Thiswas on the 4th of August, 1841.A few days afterwards my aunt BulahHart was baptized into the Church, andon the 18th of the month I bade fare-well to my father's house after a stay offorty-one days. This was a longer visitthan I had paid to any of my friends forthe last ten years.On the 9th of September, a littlecompany, consisting of myself, wife andson, and four others,started on board theboat Sandusky for Albany. Our ulti-mate destination was Nauvoo, where wearrived on the 5th of the next month.When I left Nauvoo, two years before,there were not more than a dozen houses[Column 2]in the place, but, on my return to thecity, there were several hundred.We passed by the Temple, then build-ing, and had a view of it; we thencalled at the house of Elder BrighamYoung, and there spent the night.Brother Brigham was sick, and HeberC. Kimball and Willard Richards werewith him. We laid hands upon him andhe soon recovered.I saw many of my old friends and ac-quaintances, and was informed that othersof them were dead.I met with many friends on the dayafter my return to Nauvoo, and also satin counsel with the Twelve and washappy once more to meet with myquorum. I moved my things to ElderKimball's. My wife and child were sick.On the 30th of October the city coun-cil met and among its business I was ap-pointed one of the city council ofNauvoo.-[TO BE CONTINUED.]- 
 Afternoon Session, 2 p.m_____President W. WoodruffStepped forward to the breastwork of the stand and said: Before dis-missing this Conference I want to say a few words to the Latter-day Saints. The Lord has said by reve-lation, to those who hold the keys of the Kingdom of God: "Whomsoever thou shalt bless I will bless and whomsoever thou shalt curse I will curse."I have traveled something like a hundred and seventy-five thousand miles in my day and time, and I have preached the Gospel to the nations, to the islands of the sea and to my own country. I have met, in some instances, men who pro-fessed to have faith in God and to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who have stood up before me and cursed the Prophet of God, Joseph Smith and blasphemed the name of God. But in the midst of all these things, I have never seen a moment of my life when I felt to curse any-body. I hope I never shall. But I have told these men, under these circumstances, that the curse of God would overtake them; and in no instance, when I have been moved upon to say that, has it ever fallen unfulfilled; for they have been marked cases of the judgments of God overtaking them. But with regard to blessing, I will say, if there was ever an hour in my life that I felt to bless the Latter-day Saints, it is at the present time. My heart is drawn out with love and gratitude towards God and my brethren with whom I am surrounded. I have been sus-tained as a weak instrument in the hands of God as the President of this Church. Since I have been called to this office I have been sus-tained by the Latter-day Saints, and for over fifty years of my life as an Apostle. Why should not my heart be drawn out in love to-ward such a people? The world know not the love of the Latter-day Saints. They do not comprehend it. It never entered into their souls. I am surrounded here with Prophets, Apostles, Elders and Saints of the living God; and in the morning of the resurrection, when they come out of their graves, they will pass by the Gods and the angels who are set there to watch the interests of the celestial world; they will go to those thrones, king-doms, principalities and powers which have been ordained of God for them to occupy – those who dwell in this dispensation as well as in other ages of the world. If I am faithful, I shall meet you there; I shall meet this people there; I shallmeet these Saints of the Living God there. Therefore, I feel it is my privilege to bless the Latter-day Saints. I cannot go abroad, as a man, and spread this Gospel to the world and administer to them the ordinances thereof, to have any effect, without the Holy Priesthood; and I, as a man, cannot bless the inhabitants of the earth, so that the Lord is bound to acknowledge it, only by the power of the Holy Priesthood; and that power I feel to exercise at the present time in blessing my brethren and sisters.In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I feel to bless my Councillors – Presidents Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith. They have stood by me in all the labors of life, as far as we have been associated, since we have entered into the new and ever-lasting covenant. On the same prin-ciple, I feel to bless these Apostles who surround me. We have been united. We are united in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and they have the gratitude of my heart for the labors of love and life which they have carried out in their day and time. I feel to bless the Presidents of the Seventies, with all their quorums in this Church, with every blessing that I have power to bestow upon them, as a servant of the Living God. I feel to bless the High Priests, who bear the high and Holy Priesthood after the order of Melchisedec – their Presidents and all who belong to the quorums. I also feel to bless the thousands of the Elders of Israel who have entered into covenant with the Lord, who have received a portion of the Mel-chisedec Priesthood, and who have gone forth and been faithful in the ordinances of the House of God. Ifeel to bless the Bishopric and theLesser Priesthood, which is afterthe order of Aaron - the first Priest-hood sealed upon the heads of Jo-seph Smith and Oliver Cowdery byJohn the Baptist, who held it, andwho laid down his own life for theword of God and testimony of JesusChrist. I feel to bless these Latter-day Saints, as fathers and mothers, as borthers and sisters, inall the ordinance of the House 
 of God. I feel to bless them and their families, and their flocks, and in their herds, and in all they put their hands unto. As far as I have the power to bless, they have the blessings of my heart and my spirit, in every sense of the word. And I say to all Israel, God bless you.Let us live, brethren and sisters, that when we have finished our work and our testimony, as other generations have done, we will re-ceive the same exaltation and glory. The world do not know you. The world do not know this work. They do not understand it. They have not entered into the spirit of it; they never will, except they obey the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the law of the celestial kingdom. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 7 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, FEBRUARY 3, 1894. Vol. XLVIII.THE POWER OF FAITH.Discourse Delivered at the Sixty-fourthSemi-Annual Conference, of theChurch, in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity, Sunday Afternoon, October8th, 1893, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTERI have never attended a conference since I have been a member of this Church—now nearly sixty years—at which I have refused, when called upon by the proper authority and the Spirit of God, to speak and to bear my testi-mony according to the light that I had in me, and I disliked to pass over this conference without saying something. I have been in poor condition for public speaking, having had a severe cold upon my lungs during the past week, which has prevented me from doing almost any kind of business.I have been deeply interested in the testimonies of the servants of God who have addressed us during this confer-ence. They have laid before us many great truths. My mind rests upon the subject of faith. Faith is the first prin-ciple of the Gospel. What is faith? Paul, in writing to the Hebrews, under-takes to explain it He says that "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;" and to prove this he goes on to tell what dif-ferent men accomplished through faith.(See xi chap. of Hebrews). I look upon faith as one of the most important prin-ciples that God ever revealed to man. Here we have four temples in these mountains, and hundreds of people are laboring in them. Who for? Both for the living and the dead. Why do they labor for the dead? Have they ever seen the resurrection of the dead? No, except by vision or revelation. But they have faith in it, and as an evidence of that faith they perform this work. They look forward to the resurrection and eternal judgment, to the celestial kingdom and the great blessings which God has revealed for the salvation and exaltation of the children of men. They do this by faith, and it is by this power that they have accomplished what they have during the last sixty years. By faith this tabernacle has been built, these temples have been reared, and these people have been gathered from the nations of the earth.  Thousands of Elders have been called, not from col-leges, but from the various occupations of life, and sent forth into the world to preach the Gospel without money and without price. Now for many years they have gone forth and preached this Gospel. Men have listened to them,and some spirit or power has convinced them that the testimony which these Elders have borne was true. These humble men of God have gone forth and said: &quot;The fullness of the ever-lasting Gospel has been revealed by the administration of angels; the Lord has raised up prophets and inspired men; He has organized the Church on the earth as it was in the days of Jesus Christ and the Apostles; we have brought you this Gospel; hearken to it, and we promise you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you will receive our testimony, repent of your sins, go down into the water and be baptized for the remission of your sins, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, that shall bear record and witness unto you that what we say is true." What has been the result of this? Thousands have believed that testimony and proved that it was true. These Elders labored by faith; they traveled by faith; they worked by faith. It was faith that sustained them all the way through. They trav-eled without purse and scrip, and through their faith the God of heaven fed and clothed them, and opened the way be-fore them. This has been the case now for sixty years. And many people be-lieved the testimony of these simple men. They repented of their sins, were baptized for the remission of them, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; they received that Holy Ghost, and it bore testimony to them of the truths of the Gospel.Brethren and sisters, it is by faith that you are here today, gathered from the nations of the earth. By that power you have been sustained, until you have ac-complished these things that are now before you in your history. We ought to look at these things as they are. We ought to have faith, not only in what is past but in what is to come. It is by faith that we look forward to the resur-rection of the dead. Our forefathers are in the spirit world. They died without the Gospel. They never saw the face of a prophet or an apostle. They laid down their bodies, and their spirits went into the spirit world. There they have listened to the Gospel of Christ. Jesus taught the Gospel in the spirit world while His body lay in the tomb. Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and those Elders of Israel who have been martyred and who have died for the word of God and testimony of Jesus have gone to preach this Gospel there. Spirits in prison have received their testimony. The prison doors have been opened. These spirits will come forth in the morning of the resurrection, and they will receive these blessings and glories, the same as if they had heard and received the Gospel in the flesh. And these Latter-day Saints have built these temples and gone towork in them with just as much assur-ance of the truth of these things as though it had been sounded in their ears by the trump of the archangel of God. They have had this faith, and they will not be disappointed.That is the condition the Latter-day Saints are in today. As to opposition, we may expect that, because the arch-enemy has labored against the work of God in all ages of the world. But we have reason to rejoice and to be thank-ful to our Heavenly Father that we are as well as we are today before Him. I want the Latter-day Saints to bear in mind that the ancient patriarchs and prophets spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the truth. The Lord has said just what He meant, and meant what He said. The word of the Lord will never fall un-fulfilled. If you want to know what is coming to pass, read the revelations of God in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon and in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-nants. The revelations of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith are glorious revelations. What the Lord promised in the commencement of this work has been fulfilled to the very letter up to the present. So it will continue. We should lay these things to heart.There has been a good deal said with regard to our temporal affairs. That is all right. What the brethren have said concerning our temporal condition is of importance to us. I still am of the opinion that inasmuch as Zion is going to be built up on the earth, it is the mind and will of God that we should do something for ourselves. We ought to cultivate the earth. We ought not to wait for the world to come and plant and dig our potatoes, or plant and harvest our wheat, or to build railroads and carry them on. The Presidency of the Church have shouldered a very heavy load connected with this sugar factory. Why should we not make sugar? Utah sends a very great amount every year out of the Territory for sugar. This should not be. The soil is here and the talent is here to raise beets and to make sugar. Why should not the Latter-day Saints do this and keep their money at home? Is there any sin in this? Not at all; the more of these things we would do, the better, I think, the Lord would be pleas-ed with us. I know there has been quite a feeling one way or another, be-cause we have burdened ourselves with these labors. But it is our duty to try to get the Latter-day Saints to cultivate the earth and to produce what they eat and drink and what they wear. We have tried to do this. It is true, it cost a great deal to establish the sugar plant, and the Church had to shoulder a great measure of responsibility in connection with it, 
 in order to carry it out. I do not think we have done wrong in that. When I go before my Father in heaven I am willing to bear my part of the respon-sibility, because if there is anything on earth that I was ever moved upon by the Spirit to do it was to unite in that enter-prise with my brethren. I believe it is our duty to manufacture what we use, as far as we can, at home. We refer to these temporal things because they are and always will be connected with us.I feel to rejoice myself that we are as well off as we are. There has never been a period when we have been any better off than we are today. I look back to the days when we came here. We found a barren desert. The man that led us here was Brigham Young. He was a prophet, seer and revelator. He was never destitute of revelation from the day that I first knew him until his body was laid in the tomb. He was a great man—a man of God. We see the result of his work here. He was our architect, so to speak. He fulfilled his mission in a great and wonderful manner, and when he laid his body down he went to mingle with his breth-ren and the Gods.The Gospel of Christ is true. The Zion of God is true. We are here in fulfilment of the revelations and visions of the ancient patriarchs and prophets. Read Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other prophets, and see what they said. We came here by the revelations of God. Many of the brethren felt it hard to leave our beautiful Nauvoo and to go to the mountains. Had we not done this, some of the revelations of God would have fallen unfulfilled. I say to the Latter-day Saints, have faith. Let us have faith in the promises and revela-tions of God. Do you comprehend what is manifest in the earth today? The seeds of destruction are everywhere. The judgments of God are beginning to go forth. But who acknowledges the hand of God in these things? I rejoice that the cloud of darkness is being lifted from the eyes of our countrymen in re-gard to the Latter-day Saints, and that they are manifesting kindness towards us. Speaking of our visit East, I con-fess it was marvelous in my eyes to see how different these things are today to what they have been in the past. They begin to see that the people in the moun-tains of Israel are white men, and that they have some talent. I thank God for these things. I thank Him for the kindness we have received at the hands of the friends of our nation. My prayer to God is that His blessings may rest upon our nation and upon the leaders thereof, and that the spirit of liberty, of law, of righteousness and of truth may rest upon all American citizens and everybody that dwells under this great government. It is one of the greatest governments God ever raised upon the earth. What has it been raised up for? That in the midst of it the Lord might establish His Zion and His work.Brethren and sisters, let us be true and faithful to our duties and to our God. Let us look forward to the exaltation and the blessings that God has in store for those who keep His commandments. Every man will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. There are laws celestial, laws terrestrial, and laws telestial. We speak of the celestial glory and of the heavenly hosts. Who are the heavenly hosts? They are those who have tabernacled on this earth, been faithful to God, and passed behind the veil. And they are interested in the welfare of the inhabitants of the earth. They are interested in the salvation of the human family. They have labored for it in the flesh; they do so today in the spirit world. These are the people we look to by faith. We are here upon a mission. We are trying to fulfill that mission. I hope we may be true and faithful to it.I am thankful before the Lord for the blessings that I have enjoyed in this con-ference and for the testimonies I have heard from these Apostles. They speak as men having authority, inspired by the Spirit of God, and they speak the truth. Many of our friends that have labored with us have passed away. We our-selves shall pass away in our time. I may say that if it had not been for theprayers of these thousands of Latter-day Saints, I today should have been mingling with my brethren in the spirit world. I know that I have been preser-ved by the prayers of my brethren and sisters, and I am still with you. I feel very weak, and hardly qualified to mag-nify my calling as an Apostle, as the leader of the people of Israel; in fact, no man is, only as moved upon by the power of God. What little time I may stay here I hope my heart will not be set on the riches of this world, but on doing the will of God and uniting with my brethren in bearing off the great work and responsibility resting upon us. If we will do this, all will be right. When we get to the other side of the veil, we shall know something. We now work by faith. We have the evidence of things not seen. The resurrection, the eternal judgment, the celestial kingdom, and the great blessings that God has given in the holy anointings and endow-ment in the temples, are all for the future, and they will be fulfilled, for they are eternal truths. We will never while in the flesh, with this veil over us, fully comprehend that which lies before us in the world to come. It will pay any man to serve God and to keep His commandments the few days he lives upon the earth. With regard to our position before we came here, I will saythat we dwelt with the Father and with the Son, as expressed in the hymn, "O my Father," that has been sung here. That hymn is a revelation, though it was given unto us by a woman—Sister Snow. There are a great many sisters have the spirit of revelation. There is no reason why they should not be inspired as well as men. We dwelt in the presence of God before we came here, and we have been sent here upon a mission, and I do not want to live any longer myself than I can magnify that calling. What bene-fit is it to any man to dwell here and to miss the object for which he was sent, even eternal life? Therefore, it does not pay any man to sin. When a man sins it is because he yields to the enemy, not because the devil has power over him irrespective of his agency. The devil is laboring for the destruction of the human family. But the Gospel is sent into the world to save them.Brethren and sisters, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you and to have a little time to speak to you. I hope and trust we may be true and faithful to the end of our days, that we may be satisfied when we get through with our work; that our hearts may not be set up-on anything that perisheth, but that wemay do what we can to build up Zionand bring forth salvation to mankind as far as we have the opportunity while we dwell in the flesh. God bless us and guide us all i our work, for Jesus' sake. Amen

But I will give way and, rest myself forothers".President Hyrum Smith then madesome costed remarks upon the lawyers.A brother of Dr Foster threatened theMayor and the Mayor fined him ten dollars.President Joseph Smith's views of theGovernment was then read and he was by universalapplause nominated by the Saints as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. An article wasread entitled a "Voice of Inocence from Nauvoo" anda meeting of the "Female Relief Society appointed toattend to the issue of this article. 
 During the intermission which followed theTwelve met with the Seventies and they passed a resolutionto build the Hall of the Seventies one story higher for the Presidency.In the afternoon President Brigham Young addressedthe assembly. In the course of his remarks he said"I wish to speak of the duty of lawyers classingmyself with the lawyers in the House of Israel. When any manwho is a lawyer takes a course to break peace instead of making it he is out of the way of his duty. A doctor of the lawshould study the law and make peace.The grand object we have before us is to buildthe Temple this season. We have had the effects ofslander and want a cure and balm. I carry onewith me all the while and I want you to do the sameI will tell you what it is. It is to mind our ownbusiness and let others alone and suffer wrong ratherthan do wrong. If any one will take your propertyaway let him alone and have nothing to do withhim.A spirit has been manifested to divide the Saints. This was manifest in the lastelection. It was said if they did not look outthe Saints on the flat would beat the Saints onthe hill. Great God! How such a thinglooks that the Saints should be affraid of beatingone another in the election or being beat?I would ask who built up thiscity? Would steamboats have landed here if the Saints had not come or could speculatorshave sold their lands for anything here? If theSaints had not come they might have sold for afew bear and wolf skins but not for money. Canthese speculators sell all their lands to the Saints 
 for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhereelse. I tell you nay for know it ye people that Israelis here and that they are the head and not the tail and thepeople must learn it. All those who have gone from ushave gone from the head to the tail. But if any of youwish to know how to have your bread fall butter side upthen butter it both sides and it will fall so. Upposethis work and it will roll over you. When did thiswork ever stop since it began? Never. The onlything the Saints now want to know is what does the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Wellthen build the Temple of the Lord; keep the law ofGod ye Saints and the hypocrit and scoundral will flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of Godwill be ^too^ hot for them".Joseph the Prophet & the Presidential ChairElder John Taylor followed Brigham Young in an addressupon government and political matters and Joseph in anaddress after said"As to politics I care but little aboutthe Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much forthe office as I would for the one I now hold; but as theworld have used the power of government to oppress andpersecute us it is right for us to use it for the protectionof our rights. When I get hold of the eastern papers^and^ I see how popular I am, I am affraid myself that I shallbe elected; but if I should be ^ellected^ I would not say yourcause is just but I cannot do anything for you 
 What I said in relation to theAnexation of Texasis with some unpopular. The people are opposed to it.I will take this objection away. The opposition is because it is filled up with slavery. Now I wish to turn theargument. It is the very reason why they ought to bereceived in order to watch over them. Of the two evilswe should reject the greatest. The President of Texassays if you do not receive us in the United States wewill go to the British. This would certainly be badpolicy for this nation. The British are now throughoutthe whole country trying to bribe all they can. Howmuch better it is to be to a little expence than to havethe Indians and British upon us. We should graspall the Territory we can. I know much which Ido not tell. I have had bribes offered to me but I have rejected them. The government will not receiveanything from me. They are self-sufficient; but theymust go to Hell and work out their own salvationwith fear and trembling. As soon as Texas^was^ is anexed I would liberate two are three Statesand Gipay them for their slaves and let them goto Mexico where they are mixed blacks &c. I wouldalso receive Canadia and stand by it."Next day March the 8th I met incouncil with the Twelve and First Presidency when thesubject of nominating a candidate for the vice Presidency of the U.S. came up. They had nominatedGeneral Arlington Bennet not knowing that he wasa native of Ireland. The final decision was forme to write to Col. Solomon Copeland ^of Tennessee^ to invite himto visit us and see if he would suffer his name 
 to run for the Vice Presidency and I wrote to him accordingly.On the seventh ^tenth^ day of this month BroKing Follet was buried under Masonic honours. Hewas killed while in a well by having a bucket of stonefall on him.A large Assembly of the Saints [m]et atthe Temple and was addressed by Joseph uponThe Work Calling & Spirit of Elias Elijah & MessiahThere is a difference between the spirit andoffice of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I wish first to speak off. And in order to come to the subject I will bring some of the testimony fromthe Scripture and give also my own.In the first place suffice it to saythat I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayerHis will concerning me and I saw an angel and helaid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be aPriest after the order of Aaron and to hold the keys of thisPriesthood which office was to preach repentance and baptismfor the remission of sins and also to baptize. ButI was informed that this office did not extend to thelaying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and thatthat office was a greater work and was to be given afterwardbut that my ordination at that time was a preparatorywork or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the wayfor the greater. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-70##]This was the case with John the Baptist.He came crying from the wilderness "Prepare ye the theway of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people 
 were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of Elias.John was very particular to tell the people he was not that lightbut was sent to bear witness thereof. [##John 1:7-8##] He told them that hismission was to preach repentance and baptism with waterbut that it was he who should come after him who shouldbaptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds and undertook to have performed ordinances which did notbelong to the office and calling under the spirit of Elias.The spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater revelation of God. This is the Priesthood of Elias or the Priesthood unto which Aaron was ordained.And when God sends a man into the world to Preparefor a greater work he holds the Keys of the power ofElias. It was called the doctrine of Elias evenfrom the early ages of the world.John's mission was limited to preachingand baptizing but what he did was legal and whenJesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptizedthem with fire and the Holy Ghost.We find the Apostles endowedwith greater power than John. Their office was moreunder the Spirit and power of Elijah than of Elias.In the case of Philip when he went down to Samariaunder the Spirit of Elias he baptized both men and women but when Peter and John heard of it they wentdown and laid their hands on them and they receivedthe Holy Ghost. [##Acts 8:5-17##] This shows the distinction betweenthe two powers. When Paul came to certain discipleshe asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. Theyanswered, "No." "Who baptized you then?""We were baptized unto John's baptism." "No Johndid not baptize your for he did his work right." [##Acts 19:1-5##] 
 So Paul baptized them over again for he knew what the truedoctrine was and he knew that John had not baptized themand it is strange to me that men who have read the Scrip[tures]of the New Testament are so far from these principles.What I want to impress upon yourmind is the difference of power in different parts of thePriesthood so that when any man comes among you sayingI have the Spirit of Elias you may know whether he betrue or false for any man coming having the spirit and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. [##Luke 1:17##] Johndid not transcend his bounds but faithfully performedthat part belonging to his office. And every portion ofthe great building should be prepared rightly and assigned to its proper place.It is necessary to know who holdsthe Keys of power and who do not or we may be likelyto be deceived. That person who holds the keys of Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend much more time in conversing about the spirit ofElias I shall not have time to do justice to the spiritand power of Elijah who is the Elias spoken of in thelast days. And here is the rock upon which manysplit thinking the time was past in the days ofJesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefor[e]I speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrineis true.Now for Elijah. The spirit power and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowm[ents]of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and ofthe Kingdom of God on the earth and to receive andperform all the ordinances of the Kingdom of God 
 even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children andthe hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are in heaven.Malachi says, "I will send Elijahbefore the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and Heshall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the heartsof the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earthwith a curse. [##Malachi 4:5-6##]Now what I am after is the knowledgeof God and I take my own course to obtain it. Whatare we to understand by this ^the mission of Elijah^ in the last days. In thedays of Noah God destroyed the world by a flood andhe has promised to destroy it by fire in the lastdays. But before it takes place Elijah shall first come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &cNow comes the point. What is the office and work of Elijah? and this is one of the most important subjectsthat God has revealed.He shall send Elijah to seal thefathers to the children and the children to the fathers!Now was this merely confined to the living to settledifficulties with families on earth? By no means.It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would you do were you here? Would you confine your work to the living alone. No. I would refer youto the Scripture where the subject is manifest."Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without them." [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:15##] the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.I wish you to understand this subject for it is important and if you will receive it this is thespirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connectourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and sealup our dead to come forth in the first resurrection 
 And here we want the power of Elijah to seal those whodwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This isthe power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of Jehovah.Let us suppose a case. Suppose thegreat God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himselfto Father Cutler here and tell him I offer up a decreethat whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will Iseal in heaven. You have power then? Can it betaken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by the power ^keys^ of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this isthe power of Elijah and herein is the difference betweenthe ^spirit and^ power of Elias and Elijah for while the spirit ofElias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficientto make our calling and election sure; and it isthe same doctrine where we are exhorted to go onunto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works but of laying on of handsthe resurrection of the dead &c. [##Matthew 18:18##] We cannot be perfectwithout the Fathers &c. We must have revelationthen and we can see that the doctrine of revelation asfar transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all asknowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalledfrom heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existanceThis spirit of Elijah was manifestin the days of the Apostles in delivering certain onesover to the buffettings of Satan that they may besaved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They weresealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of hell until the day of the Lord or revelation ofJesus Christ.Here is the doctrine of election thatthe world have quarrelled so much about but theydo not know anything concerning it. The doctrine 
 that the Preysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much aboutnamely once in grace always in grace and on the other side thefalling away from grace I will say a word about. They areboth wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeteriansays once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist saysyou can have grace to day fall from it to-morrow nextday have grace again and so follow it on. But the doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of Elijah wouldshow them both false and take the road between.According to the Scriptures if a man has received the goodword of God and tasted of the powers of the world to comeif he shall fall away it is impossible to renew himagain seeing that he has crucified the Son of Godafresh and put him to an open shameSo there is a possibility of falling^away^ yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannotseal against this sin for this is a reserve made in theseals and power of the Priesthood.I will make every doctrine plainthat I present and it shall stand upon a firm basisand I am at the defiance of the world for I will takeshelter under the broad cover of the wings of the workin which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the crackling ofthe thorns under the potA murderer for instance—onewho has shed inocent blood cannot have forgivenessDavid sought repentance at the hand of God carefullywith tears; but he could only get it through hell. Heobtained a promise that his soul should not be left in hell. [##Acts 2:25-31##] Although David was king he never did obtain the Spirit and Power of Elijah and the fulness ofthe Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and 
 and the throne and kingdom of David are to be taken fromhim and given to another by the name of David inthe last days raised up out of his lineage.Peter refered to the same subjecton the day of Penticost but the multitude did not getthe endowment which Peter had; but several days afterthe people asked "what shall we do?" Speaking of theircrucifying the Lord Peter said "I wot that through ignoranceye did it as did also your rulers" He did not say tothem repent and be baptized for the remission of your sinsbut he said "Repent ye therefore and be converted that yoursins may be blotted out when the times of refreshingshall come from the presence of the Lord." [##Acts 2:37-38##] This is thecase with murderers. They could not be baptized for the remission of sins for they had shed inocent bloodAgain to the doctrine of the sealingpower of Elijah. is that If you have power to seal on earthand in heaven then you should be wise. The first thingyou do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters untoyourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal gloryand go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftinessand seal all you can and when you get to heaven tellyour father ^that^ what you sealed on earth should be sealed inheaven. I will walk through the gate of heaven andclaim what I seal and those that follow me and mycounsel.The Lord once told me that what I askedfor I should have. I have been afraid to ask God tokill my enemies lest some of them should peradventurerepent. I asked a short time since for the Lord todeliver me out of the hands of the Governor of Missouriand if needs be to accomplish it to take him awayand the next news which came pouring down from 
 there was that Governor Reynolds had shot himselfI would now say Beware O Earth how youfight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the daysof Elijah when his enemies came upon him fire ^was^ called down fromheaven and destroyed them [##1 Kings 1:10-12##]The Spirit of Elias is first Elijah secondand Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the wayand the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding thekeys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placingthe seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house ofIsrael and making all things ready. Then Messiahcomes to his Temple which is last of allMessiah is above the spirit and power of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritualrock unto Moses in the wilderness. Elijah was to comeand prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit ofElias was to begin it.I have asked the Lord concerning hiscoming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign andsaid "In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens asa sign and token. In any year that the bow shall beseen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead timeand harvest during that year. But whenever you see thebow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall befamine pestelence and great distress among the nations [##Genesis 9:13-16##]But I will take the responsibility upon myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christwill not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seenthe bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord thatChrist will not come in forty years and if ever the Lord spake by my mouth he will not come in that timeJesus never did reveal to any man the precise time 
 that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and youcannot find any part which specifies the exact time of hiscoming and all who say so are false teachers. There are some important things concerning the office of the Messiahin the organization of the kingdom of God ^world^ of which I will speak hereafter."[FIGURE]The Sunday fortnight ^two weeks^ when I arrived atthe Temple Joseph was speaking. He said"I have been informed by two gentlementhat a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purposeof taking the life of President Joseph Smith his familyand all the Smith family and also the heads of theChurch. One of the gentlemen will give his nameto the public and the other wishes it to be hid forthe present. They will both testify to it on oathand make an affadavit upon it. The names of the persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are ChaucyHigby Dr Foster Mr Jackson and William and Wilson LawAnd the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundationis—he says that I had mens heads cut off in Missouriand that I had a sword run through the hearts of thepeople whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.I wont sware out a warrant againstthem for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquitythat I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready tobear it. There is honour among enemies. I amwilling to do anything for the good of the people. Iwill give the name of one of the gentlemen who havedevulged the plot. His name is Eaton. He willsware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said 
 a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhowAs concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about itnow but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tellall I know about them"Orson Spencer and Sidney Rigdon followed withaddresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose andremarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He saidIn relation to the power of ^over^ the mindsof mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequenceof the power ^of truth^ in the doctrines which I have been an instru-ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them andnot because of any compusion on my part. I will askif I ever got any of it unfair?—if I have not reproved you in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion overany man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelievingany doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do notmy enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? Theycannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voiceof one crying in the wilderness. "Repent of your sinsand prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Manfor the Kingdom of God has come unto you and hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the treeand every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit GodAlmighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down and cast into the fire"Twelve days later I attended thededication of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge. This wasthe first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The procession was composed of about five hundred membersand the whole was grand and imposingIn the fore part of the day PresidentJoseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon 
 of King Follet one of the Masonic Brotherhood but in consequenceof ill health he omitted it and called upon Elder Amasa Lymanto address the multitude who had assembled on purpose to hear the funeral discourse from Joseph.The day following this was the anniversaryof the Church which opened our anual General ConferenceGeneral Conferenceof theChurch of Jesus Christ of L. S. D [L. D. S.]held at NauvooApril 6th A.D. 1844.Conference commenced at 10 am. President Brigham Young called the Conference to order. The Prophetthen said that he should not occupy time in speakingof any differences which might have occurred in ourmidst. He said he was not a Fallen Prophetand never sustained a nearer relationship to God thanat the present time and would show before theconference closed that God was with himSidney Rigdon afterwards spokeand during the Conference of the several days hedelivered three important discourses of which I reported asynopsis in my journal and which will be found embodiedin the History of Joseph SmithOn the 3rd Sunday of the ^2nd day of con^ Sunday the 7th in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph delivered one of the most important discourses of hislife to about ten ^twenty^ thousand souls upon the subject of the death of King Follet. 
 of the Almighty.Go then to the beginning that you mayunderstand. I ask this congregation what kind of abeing is God? Turn your thoughts in your ownhearts and say have any of you seen or heard Himor communed with Him. This is a question whichmay occupy your attention. The scriptures informs usthat this is eternal life to know thee the only true andliving God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. Ifany enquire What kind of a being God is I would sayif you do not know Him you have not eternal lifeGo back and find out what kind of a being God is.If I am the man that shows you what kind of being God is then let every man and woman sit in silenceand never lift up the hand against me again. If Ido not this I will make no more pretentions toinspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like therest of the world a false teacher and you would wantto take my life. But you might just as welltake the lives of other false teachers as mine if Iwas false. But meddle not with any man for hisreligion. Every Government ought to protect ^permit^ every manto enjoy his religionI will show the world is wrong byshowing what God is. I am going to enquireafter Him so that you may know God that persecutionmay cease concerning me. I will go back to thebeginning to show what kind of a being God was. Iwill tell you and hear it O Earth! God who sits inYonder heavens is a man like unto yourselves.That God if you were to see Him to day who holdsthe worlds you would see Him like a man in formlike yourselves. Adam was made in His 
 image and talked and walked with HimIn order to understand the dead for theconsolation of those who mourn I want you to understand God andhow he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take awaythe veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principlesto know that we may converse with Him. He was once aman like unto us and the Father was once on an earthlike us, and I wish I was in a suitabll place to tell itThe scriptures inform us, mark it, thatJesus Christ said "As the Father hath power in Himself sohath the Son power in Himself." STo do what? That Father did evento lay down my ^his^ body and take it up again. Do you believeit? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell andearth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to becomeyourself ^a^ God king and priest by going from a small capacityto a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and todwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn thefirst principle of this orderHow consoling to the mourners whenthey part with their friends to know that though they lay downthis body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burningto be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christenjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive atthe station of a GodWhat did Jesus Christ do? "Thesame as I see the Father do." See the Father do what?"Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I willgive it up to the Father which will add to His gloryHe will then take a higher exaltation and I shall take His place and be also exalted"These are the first principles of the Gospel. It will take a long time after the 
 grave to understand the wholeIf I should say anything but what was inthe Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will thengo to the Bible and will make a comment on the veryfirst sentence of the history of the Creation—Berosheit. I wantto analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everythingelse. Rosh, the head; sheit, gramatical terminationWhen the inspired man wrote it he did not put the baiththere; an old Jew without any authority added the word: hethought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat at first "The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods": that isthe true meaning of the words. Baurau signifies tobring forth. If you do not believe it you do not believe the learned man of God. Learned men canteach you no more than what I have told you. Thus the head God brought forth the Gods in the Grand CouncilI will transpose it in the English language. I want you toknow and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated theCreation of the world. Some will say the scriptures^say^ so and so; but I will show you a test out of an oldedition of the New Testament in the Hebrew LatinGerman and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of thefourth ch. of Mathew our common translation saysJames the Son of Zebedee but this old book in mypossession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of thefour languages—the Hebrew Latin German and GreekThe doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if youpreach anything not according to the Bible we will crytreason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimonyof four against one—the present translation. I have the oldestbook in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank Godfor the old book but more for the Holy Ghost. 
 In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council ofthe Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and peopleit. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we knew how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they account it blasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made theworld out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in thethings of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost doesanyhow and he is within me and comprehends more than all the world and I willassociate myself with him. They infer from the word create that the world musthave been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word Baurauand does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would organizematerials to build a ship. Element had an existance from the time God had It can be organizedand reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt manIt is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead—namely, the soulthe mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it comefrom? The learned say God made it in the beginningBut it is not so. I know better. God has told meIf you do not believe it that will not make the truthwithout effect. God was a self-existing being Manexists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacleand put the spirit into it and man became a humansoul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equalwith God Himself.You who mourn the loss of friendsare only seperated from them but for a moment.The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are conversant with each other as we are on earth. I amdwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of manIt is logic to say the Spirit of man had a beginningand yet has no end? It does not have either abeginning or end. My ring is like the existanceof the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. Ifit were cut in two there would be both a beginningand an end. So with man. If he had a beginning he would also have an end.If I am right I might say God neverhad power to create the Spirit of man. God Himselfcould not create himself. Intelligence is eternal 
 and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvementThe relationship we sustain with God places us in a situationto advance in knowledge. God has power to institute lawsto instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exaltedwith Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes goodI can taste the principles of eternal life. So can youThey are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christand I know you believe it. All that which Godsees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known hiswill to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodiesat all and those revelations which will save our spirits willalso save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which restsupon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have notobeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or bedamned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in whichto tell you all; I would let you know that I am not'a fallen Prophet.'The greatest responsibility laid upon us in thislife is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says theywithout us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary thatthe sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our childrenand our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times—a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christbefore the foundation of the world for the Salvation of manIt is necessary that those who are gone before and those who are comeafter us should have Salvation in common with us and thushas God made it obligatory upon man. Hence he has saidI will send Elijah the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. [##Malachi 4:5-6##]From before the foundation of the world God hathmade provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, "Allsins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost shouldbe forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in thisworld or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable 
 sin. [##Matthew 12:31##] God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can besaved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friendscan be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternitycan save him if he has not committed the unpardonable sin.A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after thedissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If aman has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guiltyof great sins he is punished for them. When he consents toobey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.A man's own mind damns him. Ihave no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The tormentof disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burningwith fire and brimstone. INo man can commit the unpardonablesin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must bedone in this world and cannot be committed after thedissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devilfor even he stood up as a Saviour. All who ^must^ suffer untilthey obey Christ himself.The contention in heaven was Jesus saidthere would be souls who would not be saved and the Devilsaid he could save them all and laid his plans before thegrand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus ChristSo the devil rose up in rebellion against God and was castdown with all who put up their hands for him.Jesus Christ will save all except the Sons of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the unpar-unpardonable sin. He must receive the Holy Ghost havethe heavens opened to him and know God and then sinagainst Him. After a man has sinned against theHoly Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got tosay the Sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to 
 to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him andto deny the plan of Salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostatesof the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for myblood; they have the Spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord ofLife—the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannotsave them. They make open war like the Devil.If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Becautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the sameis of the devil.I could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning therelationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into theeternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my FathersKingdom and Paul says there is one glory of the sun another of the moonanother of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glorySo also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us inrelation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We have seen them walk worthily in our midst and sink ^fall^ asleep inthe arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are nowin the celestial Kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrectionof the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who willhave to wait myri[a]ds of years before they can receive the likeblessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait foryour friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph gloriousin the celestial world while their murderers shall dwell in torment forages until they have paid the uttermost farthing.I have a father brothers children and friends who ^have^ gone to a world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meetagain. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When wedepart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love whohave fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &c. It will be aneternity of felicity.A question may be asked will mothers have theirchildren in eternity. Yes Yes mothers. You shall have your children 
 for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaitingthem. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead andbe forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the childin the same precise form as it appeared before it died out of its mothersarms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions ofglory and exercise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternityis full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones ofglory with not one cubit added to their stature.I will leave this subject here and make a few remarksupon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism offire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. Anindividual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the Kingdomof God. In German the text bears me out the same as the revelations whichI have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. Youwill find it in the declaration of [Baptist, John the (NT)|[John the Baptist.  -[reads from the German]-John says "I baptize you with water, but when Jesus comes who has thepower (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost."There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling onebaptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptismnot being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay thefoundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at thedefiance of the world to contradict me if they can.Hear it all ye ends of the earth—all ye Priests—all ye sinnersand all men—Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for yourreligion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hellbut I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgivenin this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to Gnolom, to dwell inhell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world sothey shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstoneSome shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlastingburnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthinesswhich is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone.I have no enmity against any man. I love you all butI hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons misstheir mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates mehe is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sisters.I rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my agedfriends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. Noman knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall neverundertake it. I dont blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have I could nothave believed it myself. I never did harm any man sinceI was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.I cannot lie down until all my work is finished.I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellowman. When I am called by the trumph of the archangeland weighed in the balance you will all know me then.I add no more God bless you all. Amen. 
 Conference reassembled the next day April the 8thwhen Joseph arose and said it was impossible for him tocontinue the subject of the previous day in consequence of theweakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks wasone of the most important revelations of the age. He saidYet I haveA Great ProclamationIt is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for theElders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of South & North America is Zion and the mountain of theLord's house is in the centre of North and South AmericaWhen the House is done the baptismal font erectedand finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &^ordained^ kings and priests which must be done in this life—and when the place is prepared you must also go throughall the ordinances of the house of the Lord and ifyou have any dead relations for them also the sameas for yourselves—then the Elders are to go through allAmerica and build up Churches until all Zion is builtup.But this is not to commence until this Temple is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forthand accomplish the work and build up stakes inall North and South America. There will be someplace ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I thinkthis will be the one."He also remarked that this proclamationwas the greatest ever made to us as all could notcome here but it was necessary that enough shouldcome to build up the Temple and get an endowment sothat the work could spread abroad.Joseph's lungs failed him and he calledupon George J. Adams to occupy the forenoon. 
 At the close of the morning's meeting President JosephSmith turned over the Conference into the hands of the Twelveand it continued through the next day under the presidencyof Brigham Young and then adjourned to the followingSaturday to re-assemble at 2 o clock to hear a politicaladdress from Elder John Taylor.During this Conference ^244^Elders volunteered ^were called^ to go into the vineyard that season to preach the gospel.On the 4th of May I moved into mynew brick house and felt truly thankful to have acomfortable dwelling for the first time to leave myfamily in while I went out again on mission.Next day I spent with my familypreparing for my Summer's mission and I calledmy family together and blessed them and Phebe washedmy feet that I might be clean every whit.A number of Apostates on the same day which was Sunday the 5th met together and organizeda new Church and took a strong stand againstthe Prophet the Twelve and the Church. The leaderswere Wm. and Wilson Law R.D. Foster Chauncyand Francis Highby James Blakesley and others.Five days later which was ^[unclear]^  Maythe 9th I arose in the morning arranged some domesticaffairs and parted from my wife and children for thepurpose of taking my summer's mission through theUnited States to attend the General ConferencesFor the last ten years of my life with the exception ofone it had been my lot to be in the vineyard everySummer. I left Nauvoo in company withElders George A Smith J. M. Grant and Ezra Thayer 
 and his son.This was the last mission ever Josephthe Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensationHe wished none of us to remain with the exception of WillardRichards. He told John Taylor he wanted hism togo especially on this mission with his quorum and hespoke with much earnestness. He also turned to meand said brother Woodruff I want you to go and ifyou do not you will die. It rested with weight upon my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thoughtsince when musing over the awful catastrophy of his & Hyrumsmartyrdom how true his words might have been had Iremained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and WillardRichards the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo wherewith him in prison at his assassination. Had moreof us been there with him in Nauvoo we might someof us have met the death which Elder John Taylorbut barely escaped. having receivedIt might have been that Willard Richards who was theonly one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of theTwelve was also the only one of us who could stay withhim unhurt ^safely^ and he passed through that awful scene of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safefrom personal harm.I took the parting hand of Josephand Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph wasstanding in his own entery when I took his hand tobid him farewell. Brother J. M. Grant was withme. As he took me by the hand he said"Brother Woodruff, you are now about to start uponyour mission." I answered "Yes." He lookedme steadily in the eye for a time without speakingHe looked as though he would penetrate my very 
 soul but at the same time seemed unspeakably sorrowful asthough he was weighed down with a foreboding of somethingdreadful in the future. He finally spoke in a mournfulvoice—"God bless you Brother Woodruff! Go in peasce!"I turned and left him with a sorrowful heart partakingof the same spirit that rested upon him. This was the last time I ever saw his face or heard his voice again [x].During the following week we journeyedon our mission held meetings and on the 18th in NewarkKendall Co George A Smith and myself of the Twelveheld our first Conference at which were present various other officers of the Church. At the close of the ConferenceElders Charles C. Rich David Fulmer and Henry Jacobsarrived from NauvooNext evening we all met at the schoolHouse to deliver a political lecture. I called the meetingto order and introduced to the assembly Mr Henry Jacobswho arose and read General J Smiths views of the policyand powers of the United States Government afterwhich I introduced ^Mr^ David Fulmer who addressed theassembly in an effective manner showing the policyof Joseph and then I urged our claims and right to votefor our own president and George A Smith closed witha spirited political address. The next evening wealso held another meeting for the same object and had quite a time in political spirit ^matter^ and the impression made on the people was good. We had rode on thisday thirty miles to hold our meeting in a large Schoolroom in JuliettWe continued from place to placeholding meetings reading the views of General Joseph Smith to public assemblies making political speechesand placing Joseph before the public as a fitting 
 candidate for the Presidency of the United StatesOn the 1st of June we held the KalamazooConference in Comstock Kalamazoo Co. Michigan. Therewere present 2 of the quorum of the Twelve—WilfordWoodruff and George A Smith; 3 High Priests ^Council^—S. BentCharles C. Rich and D. Fulmer; 5 of the High Priestquorum—H Green, Z Coltrin Moses Smith, E Thayerand G. Coltrin and also 8 of the Seventies, 14 Elders2 Priests and 1 Deacon.The Conference was called to order byElder Charles C. Rich when Elder Wilford Woodruffwas chosen to the chair and Elders C. Dunn andE M Webb as clerks of the Conference.The various Branches were represented& President C. C. Rich in Council with the Officers afterthe close of the Conference appointed the Elders to theirstations in the different Counties of the State and he manifested much wisdom in arranging his plans in carrying out his work both on politics and religion in theState of Michigan that Season.On the 8th we held the Pleasant ValleyConferance and on the 15th another Conference was heldby us in Franklin Oaklin Co.On the 26 alone I arrived atBoston and next day had an interview with Elder BrighamYoung. We spent the forepart of the day togetherEarly in the evening he took cars forSalem. This was onThe Day of the MartyrdomElder Brigham Young and myself were setting together inthe railway Station at the time that Joseph and his brother 
 Hyrum were assassinated. This was June the 27th at a quarter past five at Carthage the place of the fiendish tragedy and half past six p.m.at Boston where Elder Young and myself were. Brigham as wesat together in the Station was very sorrowful and depressed in spiritwithout knowing the cause. This was the time that the direst blowwhich Satan had struck since the Son of God was crucified sent thespirits of the Prophet and Patriarch to join the martyred host of God's servantsToo well we afterwards knew why all the Twelve wherever they wereon that day and at that time were like the President of our quorumvery sorrowful and burdened in spirit without knowing why.Two days afterwards we held theBoston Conferenceof theChurch of Jesus Latter-Day Saintsat Franklin HallJune 29, 1844.There was present a majority of the quorum of the Twelve—namely, Brigham Young its President HeberC. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson Pratt William SmithLyman Wight and Wilford Woodruff; and also alarge number of Elders. Brigham Youngpresided.The Conference continued for two daysand was addressed by Orson Hyde Brigham YoungH. C. Kimball Lyman Wight Orson Pratt andWilford Woodruff.The Conference was well attendedthe meeting spirity and the discourses instructiveand effectual. 
 State Convention of Jeffersonian Democracy.Ticket: General Joseph Smith for the Presidential ChairSidney Rigdon Vice PresidentThe Convention met at 10 o clock a.m. July 1stin the Melodian [Melodeon] at Boston, and was organized asfollowsThe Hon Brigham Young of Nauvoo PresidentThe Hons William Smith and Gen. Lyman Wightvice PresidentsThe Hon Wilford Woodruff and Professor O Prattof Illinois A McAllister Esq of Bostonand N H Felt Esq of Salem Secretaries.The Convention was addressed with muchanimation and patriotism during the day and evening by the President Hons Orson Hyde Daniel Spencer WilliamSmith and Professor Pratt all of Illinois and George BWallace of Boston.A Preamble and many importantResolutions were adopted all of which together with the proceedings of the meeting were published in the BostonTimes of July 2nd 1844.The Melodian was crowded inthe evening and it was soon evident that a large numberof rowdies were in the galleries and disposed to makedisturbance. Among others Abby Folsom made her appearance and arose and commenced speaking whilethe President of the Convention was addressing the 
 meeting. A young man soon afterwards arose and began rowdy conductin which he was encouraged by his companions until confusion becamegeneral in the gallery. The police came in to take theyoung man out but they were badly beaten by a set of young desperadoes. After much hard fighting however theofficers succeeded in clearing the gallery of the rowdies but themeeting was also soon broken up.The Convention was adjourned until the nextday at 4 o'clock at Bunker Hill. Heber C. Kimballand George B Walace were appointed delegates to the Baltimorenational Convention.We met at 8 o clock a.m. on the 2nd ofJuly held a council and devided ourselves off into differentparts of the Vineyard and each one took several Conferencesto attend to.The same night I left the city incompany with Milton Holmes and old companionand fellow labourer in the ministry whom I had not met for five years. We left Boston at 7 o clock p.m.Next day we arrived at FatherCarter's early in the afternoon and found my wifes father and mother and her brother Fabyan and familyall well.I descovered on my arrival that brotherS. B. Stoddard and had given out an appointmentfor our Conference which was held in Scarboro onthe 6th and 7th in a Presbyterian Meeting House.There were present of the EldersWilford Woodruff S. B. Stoddard Milton HolmesElbridge Tufts and Samuel Parker. On theSunday afternoon we had an audience of about sixhundred. 
 In company of Father Carter and Milton HolmesI left Scarboro on the 9th and rode to Portland and dinedwith my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and was about to takesteam boat in the evening for Thomastown and Fox Islandsbut in the afternoon we obtained the Boston Timescontaining the solemn information of the assassination of theProphet Joseph and his brother Hyrum.Next day I took the cars for Bostonand on the following met with the Saints. They mournedthe loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meetingthey were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of theSpirit was with us so that we had a good time together.On the morrow I wrote a letterto the Editor of the Prophet published in New Yorkby the friends of our martyred leader giving a wordof exhortation to the Saints abroad to maintain theirintegrity and keep the faith and paitence of thesaints unto death.The following morning we obtainedinformation from Quincy as late as June 29th givingfull accounts of the horrid affair at Carthage and thetremendious loss which the Church had sustained.The Governor himself acknowledged the death of Josephand Hyrum to be a wanton murder. The State ofIllinois was in commotion and Governor Ford hadmade Quincy his head quarters and issued a Proclamationto the citizens of the State. The news of the daystated that the Mormon Leaders in Nauvoo had doneall they could to restrain the disciples of the martyredProphet from vengeance still there was evidently adisposition of both the people and the troops to destroyNauvoo lest the Mormons should hold a fearfulreckoning in the State in their desperation and despair 
 at the loss and assassination of the Prophet and Patriarch of the ChurchThe wicked fleeth when no man pursueth.I again held meeting with the Boston Saintson Sunday the 14th preached to them in the forenoon ^from Rev Ch VI verse 9, 10, 11, & 12;^ administered the sacrament in the afternoon and preached again in the eveningI was the only one of the Twelve at that time in Boston.We had not heard from any of our brethrenof the calamity which had fallen upon us in the great breerevementof the Church but as I arose on the morning of the 16th twoletters were handed to me one from Erastus Snow and the otherfrom John E. Page confirming the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch.I immediately wrote three letters to Brigham Young and sent one to Peterboro N. H. one to Lowelland one to Bradford Mass. I then went direct to thePost Office and took out a letter directed to G. A. Smith fromhis wife in which Mrs Woodruff wrote a few lines to mewhich was the first intelligence I had from her since I left home. She related to me a dream which Joseph hada few days before he sealed his testimony with his blood.He thought that William and WilsonLaw bound him and cast him into a pit or welllike as Joseph was anciently. He struggled hardand got up so that he could look out and he sawthe Laws a little distance off one of them in thegrasp of a tigar and the other in that of a snakeThey called to him to come and help them but he told themthey had bound him and he could not; and he thoughtin his dream that a brother soon came along and tookhim out of the pit.On the following day July 17thElder Brigham Young arrived in Boston. I walked with him to 57 Temple Street and called upon 
 Sister Vose. Brother Young took the bed and I the armchair and here we veiled our faces and gave vent to ourgrief. Until now I had not shed a tear since I heardof the death of the Prophet but my soul had felt nervedup like steael. After giving vent to our grief in tearswe felt more composed. Brother Brigham left thecity again on the same day.On the following day Elders Orson HydeHeber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt arrived in the cityand President Brigham Young also returned and we mettogether and held a council. I wrote a letter to the Prophet advising the Elders who had families inNauvoo to go immediately to them and for all theauthorities of the Church to forthwith assemble atNauvoo for a Council: "By order of the Quorum ofthe Twelve. Wilford Woodruff clerk; Brigham Young President. -[Published in Deseret News Vol VII. No 44]-That night there was a meeting in a hall in Washington Street opposite Boydston Hall.Elder Orson Hyde had advertized to preach on the murderof Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the close of which acollection was to be taken up to pay his expenceshome.I reported a synopsis of his address andrecorded it in my Journal.At the close of Elder Hyde's discoursePresident Brigham Young arose and said he felt disposedto add his testimony."Be of good cheer. The testimony isnot in force while the Testator liveth: when he diedit was in force: so it is with Joseph. On the dayof Pentecost there were but one hundred and twenty ofthe Saints but at that time there was added threethousand Souls. When God sends a man to do a 
 work all the devils in hell cannot kill him until he gets throughhis work: So with Joseph. He prepared all things gave the keysto men on the earth and said I may soon be taken from you."I left Boston on the 20th and arrived at myfather's house in Farmington two days later. I found my fatherand stepmother alone, not a child with them in their decline oflife to watch over themI had but twenty four hours to stayand I happily improved the time. My father was 67 yearsof age and I might never have seen him again in mortalityand my mind had been deeply impressed of late that Ihad something to do for my parents.As the sable shades of a serene nightdrew her curtain over the earth and stilled the cares of daywe met alone: none but congenial spirits were there. Iarose and with the Spirit like that of Joseph towards hisfather Jacob opened my heart to my father and he reciprocatedmy sentiments. [##Genesis 46:29##] I then laid my hands upon his head andaccording to the authority of the Priesthood and Apostleship(confered upon me under the hands of the Twelve Apostlesupon the corner stone of the house of the Lord in Far WestPresident Brigham Young being mouth) I ordained myfather Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an Highpriest and Patriarch after the order of Melchezedic and I placed upon his head the seals of the covenant in connectionwith Bulah Thompson and Azubah Hart—my own mother and stepmother and sealed him up unto eternallife. I shall never forget the deep satisfaction and heavenly spirit of that night beneath my father's roofSleep departed from me and I was wrapt in themeditations and visions of by gone days and the daysto come and of this life and the one hereafter. 
 The next day I again left my father's houseand arrived in New York on the next  ^following^ morning. I thentook steamboat and found on board Elders Orson Hyde and Orson PrattWe were bound for Albany at which place when we arrivedwe took the rail for Buffaloo and on the way at chSchenectadywe joined Elders B. Young H. C. Kimball and Lyman Wightmaking six of our quorum journeying homewards together.We reached Buffaloo on the 25 and nextmorning took steam boat and in 24 hours reached Cleavlandbut Orson Hyde left us at Fairport to visit his family inKirtland.Arriving at Detroit we spent the night of the27th at the railroad Hotel and the next morning took steamboatpropeller Hercules for Chicago.This was Sunday. I spent a part of the day in writing. We had good State rooms and wascomfortable. We spoke much of our famlies and the deathof Joseph and Hyrum, and we felt anxious to get home.President Young expressed his feelings tome upon a variety of subjects and among other things he saidhe wished me to keep an account of things as he shouldlook to me for his Journal some day. I had aninteresting time with Lyman Wight talking over old timesand looking forward to new ones.Joseph's Presentiment that he would not see the Age of Forty.During our conversation Lyman Whight informed methat Joseph told him while they were in Gaol [jail] together ^in^ that heMissouri that he should not live to see his fortieth yearof age but bid him not to reveal it until he was dead.Two nights before our arrival in NauvooElder Kimball had a dream which he related to us. He 
 thought he was preaching to a large congregation upon the policy of the nationand of the work of God, and he said Joseph had laid the foundation and weshould have to carry out his measures. Joseph was himself present and heard alland sanctioned it. All seamed perfectly naturalWe stoped at various places going down the Mississippi:among others the town of Burlington. We then prepared ourminds to once more behold the City of Nauvoo and embraceour families and friends.August the 6th We were landed at the upper stonehouse at 8  oin the evening and were welcomed with joyby all the citizens we met. We hired a coach and Iaccompanied my brethren to their families after which Iwas conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to oncemore meet with my wife children and friends.When we landed in the city of Nauvooa deep gloom seemed to rest over it which we never experiencedbefore. This was August the 6thThe next morning I went through thecity of Nauvoo saw many friends and met in Council withthe quorum of the Twelve at Elder Taylor's whom we foundrecovering from his wounds received at the massacre of theProphet and Patriarch of the Church.We felt to rejoice at again having the privilege of meeting together in council in Nauvooafter passing through such trying scenes and to be welcomedby the Saints who considered it Providential for the Twelveto arrive at this Particular juncture when their minds wereagitated their hearts sorrowfull and darkness seemed tocloud their path feeling like sheep without a shepherd theirbeloved Prophet having been taken away.We spent the forepart of the day inCouncil at brother Taylor's and in the afternoon at 4 o'clockthe Twelve the High Council and the High Priests metat the Seventies Hall. 
 After prayer by Wm Marks President of the stake President Brigham Young called upon President Rigdonto make a statement to the Church concerning his message tothe Saints and the vision and revelation he had received.President Rigdon said, The object of my missionis to visit the Saints and offer myself to them as a GuardianI had a vision at Pittsburg June the 27th. This was presentedto my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuationof the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.It was shown to me that this Church mustbe built up to Joseph and that all the blessings we receivemust come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesmanto Joseph and I must come to Nauvoo and see that theChurch is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustains thesame relationship to this Church as he has always done. Noman can be the Succcessor of Joseph.The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christthrough Joseph. There must be revelation still. Themartyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrationsI have been consecrated a Spokesman to Joseph and Iwas commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganizedthough our head is gone.We may have a diversity of feelingson this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman untoJoseph and I want to build up the Church unto him andif the People want me to sustain this place I want it uponthe principle that every individual shall acknowledge it forhimself.I propose to be a Guardian to the peopleIn this I have discharged my duty and done what God hascommanded me and the people can please themselveswhether they accept me or not." 
 President Brigham Young said, "I do not care wholeads the Church even though it were Ann Lee; but one thingI must know and that is what God says about it. I have the Keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God onthe subject.I know there are those in our midst whowill seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Josephand Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulnessof the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the priesthood may remain.Joseph confered upon our heads all thekeys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which hehimself held before he was taken away and no man orset of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve inthis world or in the world to come.How often has Joseph said to the TwelveI have laid the foundation and you must build thereonfor upon your shoulders the kingdom rests.The Twelve as a quorum will not bepermitted to tarry here long. They will go abroad andbear off the Kingdom to the nations of the earth and baptizethe people faster than mobs can kill them off. I wouldlike were it my privilege to take my valise and travel andpreach until we had a people gathered who would be true.My private feelings would be to let the affairs of men and women alone & only go and preachand baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet whateverduty God places upon me in His strength I intend to fulfillit.I want to see this people with the various quorumsof the Priesthood assemble together in Special Conferenceon Tuesday next at 10 o clock a.m." (which was carriedunanimously by vote) 
 At the request of William Marks who wasthen Presiding over the Stake a special meeting was held nextmorning at 10 o'clock to choose a Guardian or President andTrustee. Sidney Rigdon took his position in a waggonabout two rods in front of the Stand and harangued theSaints for about an hour and a half upon chosing aGuardian for the Church. The meeting was then dismissedwhen President Brigham Young gave out an appointmentfor the brethren to assemble at 2 o'clock.At the appointed time the brethrencame together. Present of the Twelve—Brigham YoungHeber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt WillardRichards Wilford Woodruff and George A SmithThe several quorums were organized on and around the Stand according to order.The meeting being opened PresidentBrigham Young arose and said, Attention all!This congregation makes me think of the days of king Benjamin the multitude being so great that all couldnot hear. [##Mosiah 2:7-8##] I request the brethren not to have any feelingfor being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. Wewant you all to be still and give attention that all mayhear. Let none complain because of the situation ofthe congregation. We will do the best we can.For the first time in my life—for thefirst time in your lives—for the first time in theKingdom of God in the nineteenth Century without aprophet at our head do I step forth to act in my callingin connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostlesof Jesus Christ unto this generation—Apostles whomGod has called by revelation through the Prophet Josephwho are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world. 
 This people have hitherto walked by sight and not byfaith. You have had the Prophet in your midst. Do you allunderstand? You have walked by sight and without muchpleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.Heretofore you have had a Prophet as the mouth of the Lord tospeak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith andnot by sight.The first position I take in behalf of the Twelve and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter-day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want tochoose a Prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet and Patriarch are taken from our midst do you wantsome one to guard to guide and lead you through thisworld into the Kingdom of God or not? All that wantsome person to be a guardian or a Prophet a Spokesmanor something else signify it by raising the right hand-[No votes]-When I came to this stand I had peculiarfeelings and impressions. The faces of this peopleseemed to say we want a Shepherd to guide and lead usthrough this world. All who want to draw awaya party from the Church after them let them do itif they can but they will not Prosper.If any man thinks he has influence amongthis people to lead away a party let him try it and hewill find out that there is power with the Apostles which will carry them off victorious through all the world andbuild up and defend the Church and Kingdom of GodWhat do the people want? I feel asthough I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn forthirty days at least, then rise up shake myselfand tell the people what the Lord wants of them 
 Although my heart is too full of mourning to launch forth intobusiness transactions and the organization of the Church I feel compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those dutiesGod has placed upon me.I now wish to speak of the organizationof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If theChurch is organized and you want to know how it is organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do you want me to tell your feelings?Here is President Rigdon who was Counselorto Joseph. I ask, where are Joseph and Hyrum?They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wantsto act as his counselor he must go beyond the veil where he is.There has been much said about PresidentRigdon being President of the Church and leading thepeople, being the head &c &c. Brother Rigdon hascome 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do foryou. If the people want President Rigdon to lead themthey may have him; but I say unto you that thequorum of the Twelve have the Keys of the Kingdomin all the world.The Twelve are appointed by the finger of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest of the Twelve an indipendant body who have theKeys of the Priesthood—the Keys of the Kingdom ofGod to deliver to all the world: this is true, so helpme God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the First Presidency of the Church.I do not know whether my enemies will take my life or not and I do not care for I want to bewith the man I love. 
 You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer andRevelator: God must do this. You are like children withouta father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appointany man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordainhim. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if youdo want any other man or men to lead you take them andwe will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in allthe world.I know who are Joseph's friends and who arehis enemies. I know where the keys of the Kingdom areand where they will eternally be. You cannot call a manto be a Prophet; You cannot take Elder Rigdon and place him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by them.I tell you there is an over anxiety to hurrymatters here. You cannot take any man and put himat the head; You would scatter the Saints to the four winds; You would sever the Priesthood. So long as weremain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operationwith us; and if you go out of that course God will havenothing to do with you.Again some perhaps think that our beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured—would notbe looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remainsfaithful he will not act against our counsel nor we againsthis but act together and we shall be as oneI again repeat, no man can standat our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I havespared no pains to learn my lesson of the kingdom inthis world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not soI could go and live in peace; but for the Gospel and yoursakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to bekilled all the day long. You have never lived by faith.Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid

 the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have neverseen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundationlaid and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in theworld: we can build a Kingdom faster that Satan can kill theSaints off.What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch forthe whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing. If brotherSamuel H Smith had been living it would have been hisright and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to Joseph andHyrum; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and hecan waft himself with his brothers his friends and the Saints.Do you want a Patriarch? Here is brother Williamleft; here is uncle John Smith, uncle to the Prophet Joseph leftIt is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongsto Joseph's family.Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has therebeen a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is hisbusiness? To take charge of the temporal affairs so thatthe Twelve and the Elders may go on their business. Josephcondescended to do their business for them. Josephcondescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the UnitedStates and it was a great condescension.Do you want a spokesman? Hereare Elder Rigdon brother Amasa Lyman (whom Josephexpected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you wantthe Church properly organized or do you want a spokesmanto be a chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to bespokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but canhe now act in that office? If he wants now to be aSpokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side of the veil for the prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Whywill Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthoodor of the organization of the Kingdom of God? I am plain.

 Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want toclip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the Keys goand build up the Kingdom in all the world wherever the people willhear them?If there is a spokesman, if he is King and Priest lethim go and build up a Kingdom unto himself. That is his right. Itis the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.I want to live on the earth and spread truth throughall the world. You Saints of Latter-days want things right. Iften thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet Joseph Smith'sshoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you havea right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Churchis organized.Now if you want Sidney Rigdon or William Lawto lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but Itell you in the name of the Lord that no man can putanother between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. Why?Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committedinto their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last dispensation for all the world. Don't put a threadbetween the Priesthood of God.I ask who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum?I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a headand that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of thatApostleship.Brother Rigdon was at his side—not above.No man has a right to councisel the Twelve but Joseph SmithThink of these sayings ^things^. You cannot appoint a Prophet but if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keysof the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairsof the Church and direct all things aright.Now all this does not lessen the character of

 President Rigdon. Let him magnify his calling and Joseph willwant him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assunderMay God bless us all."Much more was said by President Youngwhich I did not write.Amasa Lyman said: I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratifiedwith the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seenthe relation I bear to my desceacsed brother. I never did conceive it gaveme precedance to go before the Twelve.I do not make any exceptions to anything he has said. I beleive there is no power or officer or means wanted tocarry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied thatno man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelveas has been said.There is one thing to secure the salvation ofthis people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to knowthe right and be united—it has been presented by President YoungAll I design to do is to redeem my pledge.President Young has stood next to the ProphetJoseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I willstand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith andwill be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will besaved.There is no nead of a President. We have a headhere. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostlesare that head. We now see the necessitty of the Apostleship.I might rise up as well as any other man toask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering mysalvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvationthrough all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it—the first one called to do the same in all the world.

 have the same.I could not advocate the choosing of a President and myself a candidateso then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as theTwelve did to Joseph either on one side or the other. I do not want to go beforethem or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our unitedfaith and efforts."President Rigdon called upon W. W. Phelps to speak inhis behalf as he could not speak himself.W. W. Phelps arose and said: With the knowledge I haveI cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believeenough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to act.I have known many of them for 14 years and I havealways known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the ChurchI have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in theirhands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer Ihave seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts bloodand that is an evidence that they will walk by counsel.I am happy to see this little lake of faces andto see the same disposition and spirit manifested here to day asit was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and HyrumSmith was brought home dead to this city: then you submitted tothe law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. AndI see the same thing here to day. You are now determined asone man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I cam happythat the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submitthemselves to the authority of the Priesthood.I have feelings about this especially for PresidentRigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I broughtPresident Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. Icould not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the worldhe did receive part and I hope he will submit.I want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on

 the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them goon and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in aguardian of the Church.We have hitherto walked by sight and if any manwanted to know anything he had only to go to brother Joseph.Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortless.I want to say that brother Joseph came andenlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me thesame as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me inhis own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I asked^if the building was on wheels?^ He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove allround the hills and Valleys. He then told the drivers to driveon over the hill into Iowa. I told him Devil Creek was beforeus. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creekor any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.There is a combination of persons in this city whoare in continual intercourse with William and Wilson Law who areat the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Josephand there are persons now in this city who are only wanting powerto murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead andbuild up the Temple and then you will be endowed: when theTemple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel willbe endowed as well as the Elders.If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your dutyand you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as Ihave breath.When Joseph was going away he said he was goingto die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am nowalive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to live.I want you all to recolect that Joseph and Hyrum have only been removed from the earth and they nowcounsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder

 and ball.Parley P. Pratt remarked: What has been said has been wellsaid. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they willcease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If Iexchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to befaithful.If there are wicked men here it is because we support themStop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.I am willing to do good to all men especiallyto the household of faith Our enemies will cease to dwell here whenyou cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will ceasewhen you cease to support them. I know we can all live andbe happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wantsa doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he canfind. I would die a natural death sooner than I would havea wicked doctor to healp me off. I would go without sueing allthe days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I willnot say anything about the merchants because you all know them.President Brigham Young again arose and said:"There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we canaccomplish all we want to have done without without callingthis convention of the whole Church. I am going to present toyou the leading items.I do not ask you to take my counsel or advisealone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother Rigdonis the person you want to lead you vote for him but notunless you intend to follow him and support him any asyou did Joseph. Do not say so unless you mean totake his counsel hereafter.And I would say the same for theTwelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unlessyou intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not
