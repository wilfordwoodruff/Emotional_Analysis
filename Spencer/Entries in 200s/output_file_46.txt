 1897the marriage ceremony on behalf of my daughter Alice and William McEwan my wife Emma & several of our friends also present. After I performed the sealing ordin-ance and before the couple arose from the altar, I addressed them as follows: You are now husband and wife, having entered into this covenant, and promisishave been made to you for time and eternity. Now if you honor God, yourselves and your parents through all time, and keep the commandments of God and thecovenants you have entered into, I will promise you that you will be trueand faithful throughout all eternity, and I will tell you the reason why. Whilehere you and all of us are surrounded by temptations, because we are wheredevils dwell, they are all around us and have the power to tempt us, andhere is the place where they work. But there is no man or woman who has been true and faithful here until death that will ever be disturbed orannoyed by them after death for the reason that when the faithfulSaints receive their resurrected bodies, they will occupy a place in the Celestial Kingdom, and there is where the devils do not dwell; and therefore when you get there, there will be no one to tempt or lead astray, and for that reason, if you are true and faithful here, you willbe true and faithful there throughout all eternity. Here iswhere your trouble lies. We have them to contend with in thiscity and this Territory, and there are plenty of them in the midstof the Latter-day Saints. As to the number of them I do not know, but there are plenty of them. They are continually working for our distruction, and they do all they can against us. When those who are guided by these evil spirits die, they go where they are, and the evil spirits will still have power over them. While they will have nopower over faithful Saints who have learned to resist them in theflesh."  This evening we had a marriage reception at the house

Woodruff.Salt Lake CityUtah.My Dear Brother: â€” I enclose letter frommy old Country which is self explanatory. Doubtlessyou will remember last September I received a letterof inquiery in relation to me filling a Mission to mynative home Switzerland I frankly laid before you thecirconstances of my aged Mother, invalid Sister and alsofully explained the course I propose to persue Vis: get myMother confortably situated, save money and depart abroad,soon after this a New feature made its appearance, vismy wife infedelity, her marriage etc., the abuse of the new husband to my two children etc. I wrote fully to you allof the aforesaid Circonstances.Now I have worked exceedingly hard and have on handto day something like $90 or $100 to start on, and see methrough my mission, which amount will barely carry meto my field of Labor.Brethren, I dont by any means wish to be understoodas offering the foregoing as excuses, for God knows I desireto honorably fill my mission, the only trouble is as yousee, my own flesh and blood are apparantly left to themercy of a Cold hearted people. If I send $100 as suggestedin the letter Enclosed, this leaves me without one Cent toproceed to preach the Gospel.
