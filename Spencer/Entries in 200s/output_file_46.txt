 June 24, 1894  The question for you. Wherever the Eternal   Everlasting and Holy Priesthood or its influence  Dwells there is Protection and salvation and  Nowhare Els. For the ritghts of the Priesthood are   inseparably connected with the Heavens and the Heavens  can ownly be controlled upon the principles of righteousness  The Lord Revealed to Joseph Smith the Prophet   and said that Angels were standing in the Temple   in Heaven holding in their hands sharp sickles and crying   unto God dDay & night saying let us go down and   reap down the fields. But the Lord [said] unto them pluck not  up the tares while the Blade is yet tender Lest you   destroy the wheat also wait untill the wheat is gathered   and the tares bound in Bunddles then the field rem-  aineth to be burned I now bear testimony to this  Assembly that that day has come. These destroying  Angels are sent forth to visit the Earth and have   commencd to poor out the Judgments of God   upon the wicked and will continue untill the   scene is wound up and all fulfilled that God   has promised. Therefore Judgment awaits  the wicked. President Cannon followed and  bore his Testimony upon the same subject      See 86 section of D.C. 5 6 & 7 verses. W Woodruff  Also Testified that the Prophet Joseph sealed upon   the Heads of the Twelve Apostles All the Keys of the kingdom [of]  God that God had sealed upon him And commanded them   to bear off the Kingdom of God or they would be Damed

Woodruff is  an outside place with a mixed population and re-  quires all the care the Authorities can give it. Also  the Co op Store of the Town has been badly managed,  but is now under the direction of Bro Jacobsen who  has the confidence of the people and I understand  of the Z. C. M. I. who would I think probably close  out the Store if Bro Jacobsen (whom they know)  goes off and such action would cause much dissatis-  faction.    I feel it to be my duty to state the foregoing,  and ask if it can consistently be done that Bro

 1897  the marriage ceremony on behalf of my daughter Alice and William McEwan my   wife Emma & several of our friends also present. After I performed the sealing ordin-  ance and before the couple arose from the altar, I addressed them as follows: You are   now husband and wife, having entered into this covenant, and promisis  have been made to you for time and eternity. Now if you honor God, yourselves and   your parents through all time, and keep the commandments of God and the  covenants you have entered into, I will promise you that you will be true  and faithful throughout all eternity, and I will tell you the reason why. While  here you and all of us are surrounded by temptations, because we are where  devils dwell, they are all around us and have the power to tempt us, and  here is the place where they work. But there is no man or woman who has   been true and faithful here until death that will ever be disturbed or  annoyed by them after death for the reason that when the faithful  Saints receive their resurrected bodies, they will occupy a place in the   Celestial Kingdom, and there is where the devils do not dwell; and   therefore when you get there, there will be no one to tempt or lead astray,   and for that reason, if you are true and faithful here, you will  be true and faithful there throughout all eternity. Here is  where your trouble lies. We have them to contend with in this  city and this Territory, and there are plenty of them in the midst  of the Latter-day Saints. As to the number of them I do not know,   but there are plenty of them. They are continually working for our   distruction, and they do all they can against us. When those who   are guided by these evil spirits die, they go where they are, and the   evil spirits will still have power over them. While they will have no  power over faithful Saints who have learned to resist them in the  flesh."  This evening we had a marriage reception at the house

My Dear Brother: â€” I enclose letter from  my old Country which is self explanatory. Doubtless  you will remember last September I received a letter  of inquiery in relation to me filling a Mission to my  native home Switzerland I frankly laid before you the  circonstances of my aged Mother, invalid Sister and also  fully explained the course I propose to persue Vis: get my  Mother confortably situated, save money and depart abroad,  soon after this a New feature made its appearance, vis  my wife infedelity, her marriage etc., the abuse of the new   husband to my two children etc. I wrote fully to you all  of the aforesaid Circonstances.    Now I have worked exceedingly hard and have on hand  to day something like $90 or $100 to start on, and see me  through my mission, which amount will barely carry me  to my field of Labor.    Brethren, I dont by any means wish to be understood  as offering the foregoing as excuses, for God knows I desire  to honorably fill my mission, the only trouble is as you  see, my own flesh and blood are apparantly left to the  mercy of a Cold hearted people. If I send $100 as suggested  in the letter Enclosed, this leaves me without one Cent to  proceed to preach the Gospel.

 The desire of my heart is to do my duty and  I confess I am between two large blazes, my flesh & blood  on one side demanding my attention, the cries of suffering  humaty for the truth at the other, if I had means I  should decide to depart at once, but now I dont know  what to do. Prest: Ricks is away hence I appeal to you  for councel, What shall I do? and how shall I do it?  I can land myself to my field, but have no source  to get one cent while away, if I send money for my Children  I cant go on my Mission this spring at least, and to  think of going and my Children not emancipated almost  crushes me to the heart. Again I ask, What Shall I Do?    Trusting you will excuse my troubling you I beg  to remain    Yours in the Gospel    C. E. Luthy    B. I Enclose stamp, please return the letter  of Elder J. J. Scharrer, when you reply    Let him send for his children and  postpone his mission till some  time in the future when he is  again prepared for that Labor.  J. F. S.
