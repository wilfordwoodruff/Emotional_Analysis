THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY, COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'S GREAT BOOK  REFORM,  An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of the United States, showing Dangers, Defects and Remedies.  Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.  The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I. Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion; VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United States Army. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the Swiss Confederation.  The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, from an independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only the welfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart. The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of the present period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The style of the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chaste and may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehend by all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.  The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Army to fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service, will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interesting topics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to other European systems.  The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of the principal staff officers of the U.S. Army:  San Francisco, October 11, 1894.  "I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book on the POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchant and vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history, vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of the day. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusal and study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully as any sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."  The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, please send your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco, Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.

THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY, COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'S GREAT BOOK  REFORM,  An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of the United States, showing Dangers, Defects and Remedies.  Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.  The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I. Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion; VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United States Army. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the Swiss Confederation.  The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, from an independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only the welfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart. The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of the present period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The style of the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chaste and may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehend by all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.  The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Army to fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service, will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interesting topics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to other European systems.  The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of the principal staff officers of the U.S. Army:  San Francisco, October 11, 1894.  "I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book on the POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchant and vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history, vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of the day. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusal and study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully as any sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."  The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, please send your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco, Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.

ENDENTRY John C. Dalton July 18 1894  ENDENTRY REFORM.—Colonel Ralph de Clairmont, a master of languages, a traveler and writer, who for many years has been a resident of this city, has just issued a book of over 260 pages, which is an essay on the political, financial and social condition of the United States. The essay is bold and it points to dangers and defects and sug- gest remedies for existing evils. The writer, who has devoted to the subject of his book a great deal of close attention, and has studied it from every point of view. gives his impression in plain but comprehensive language in different chap- ters which treat of caveat patria, law and justice, legislation, the press, education, religion, finance, the Federal Government and the United States army. He dwells upon the various abuses that he has en- countered in the pursuit of his subject and for each has a suggestion for a correction of the same. With a view to compariosn, the author presents the constitution of the United States together with the one of the Republic of Switzerland. The latter is based on that of the United STates. In it are lacking features which the Moun- tain Republic has, after many years of careful watching, concluded could be omitted and for which it has substituted others which are deemed superior. In the chapter on the army there are many valu- able suggestions. San Francisco: Pub- lished for the author. ENDENTRY Eden March 25th 1894  President Woodruff Der. Brother.

Would you be so kind br Woodruff as to ascertain how it is with her and if you could get her a place with a family wanting help, that for her services would bring her with them to the valley, she could serve them till it was sufficient, till they were satisfied; you would be doing good perhaps saving a soul from death and I should feel myself under lasting obligation to you and be most happy to reciprocate your kindness in any way which opportunity might present. The family all belong to the church and were of excellent moral character which I hope still is the case. Be so kind as write me at all events to the Star Office Liverpool as soon as you are prepared to give me what information you may obtain about Lucy's situation, and chances of going west.

July 25th, 1894.  President W. Woodruff,  Dear Brother:—  I am informed that Bro. David Loveland, of Honeyville, is to go on a mission to the Southern States in the month of September. And I felt it my duty as presiding elder of that ward to inform you of his financial situation.  I signed the letter which he wrote to you some time ago, but having only just been called there to preside, his financial situation was misrepresented to me by himself and I thought it my duty to inform you how he is situated at the present time.  He has quite a large family to support and they have nothing to depend upon only what he earns by laboring for other people by days' work having scarcely any land of his own, and he is in debt about $200.00 for the house and land where he resides at the present time and I know that his family is quite destitute at the present time both for food and clothing, and I realize his wife would not be able to send him any means during his absence from home. And having found out his true situation I felt it my duty to inform you.  Hoping this will be satisfactory to you, and not having any desire to do Bro. Loveland any injury.

No other valley within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won- derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15  miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000 souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mild winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories in the west, the best shoe and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Franklin, where is being turned out a class of yarns, blankets and linseys etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en- joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.
