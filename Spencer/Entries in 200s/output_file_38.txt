But with deepest regrett, must inform you, that it seems  to me impossible to partake of this privilege, and to respond  to the call, at as early a date as the 18th of this month, as I  havent got the ready means on hand, and it looks very  doubtful, wether I'd be able to obtain the necessary means  by that time. I have got some means coming to me, should  I receive the same before the 29th of August, I would  gladly and willingly respond to the call, if not, I would  kindly ask you for a little more time.    I shall do the best of my ability, and with the help of the  Lord, hope to be enabled, to comply with the request very soon.

 Merreott, Weber Co Utah Nobr 29th 1891    President W. Woodruff,    Dear brother!    For some time I have had on my mind to  write you a letter & present a few things  just as I find them when traveling amongst  the people & make a sugestion like this:    Because prayer in familys is much neclegted I  would suggest that each ward be divided into ^(say)^ four  districts & that in each of these districts be held a  prayer meeting once every two weeks & that the  object of these meetings be prayer & very little  preaching in order to encourage a Spirrit of  prayer. This would have a tendency to turn the hearts  of the people in that direction. I was, at one time,  precsent in a meeting where pretty much all prayed  who wanted to, first one, and than another &  there was a Spirit & power precsent like a burning  fire and greate rejoycing. Many such meetings would  undoubtedly prove ^to be^ a greate blessing to the people in  general. There is ^yet^ people, who think that we ar doing   wrong in giving ^up^ principles in order to please the  Government, people, who thinks the Lord would speedily

 have come to our deliverance had we only held to   our principle. To all such I would say that they   need not be allarmed becouse the Lord makes things   a little easmore easy for awhile;  c. the final test is   yet to come if I have got the Spirit of the truth   & all will have a chance to show their integrety  & after that test is over the kingdom ^of God^ will be in   power. One man went so far as to say that the   Savior would not come for the first two   thousand years & that we would give up everthing   to avoid percsecution, that the Church of Christ   anciently became a beast * & that a second beast   was to come up of the earth to take the place of   this church before the final establishment of the   the kingdom of God on the earth. A greate mistake.   I have heard about one dussin instances that people   have seen in their dreams armies arrayed against   Zion and a batle fought. One young man has knowledge   that he will be shot in that batle but the army   was destroied as if by a whirlwind. One man saw  this three times in one night. A woman sa[w] a batle and   at once she saw an army come down from heaven   dressed in white and they came bewixt us and our   enimies & the enemy disappeared.

I hope we will   have the Salt Lake Temple didicated before that  scene becouse when that Temple is didicated I   know we shall have increaced power. Our power   is not in the arm of flesh it is in the holy one  in Israel and he will reveal himself in that   Temple.

You  know as well as I do, that we have  had several chastisements during  the last fifty years: Should not our  age and experience prove beneficial  at this time; My age being over 73 years.    You know the Lord  will not permit Isreal to do that  which other nations are doing. They  are ignorant of the designs and pur-  poses of God our Father; but Israel  has been taught, His laws, and will  be the instruments in His hands, to do  this great work, and perform this stra-  nge act. Accordingly we must not  grieve the good spirit by our neglect  in obeying the laws given to Israel.

North Temple Street    Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 29, 1891    President Wilford Woodruff:   Dear Brother    In reply to the call   made of me as a missionary to go to the   Sandwich Islands, I will say that I am   ever willing to respond to the calls made of   me by the Priesthood of God. My finantial   circumstances, however, are not in as favor-   able a condition as I would like to leave them   in, as I will be oblidged to pay intrest on   borrowed money during my absence, and will   necessairily have to sell some of my intrest   in the firm with which I am connected in   order to go. However, I am on hand to go,   but if it meets your approval, I would rather   not leave until the first of December in   order that I may have more time to   streighten my affairs.    Respectfully your brother   Matthew Noall    Give him the   time he needs. J. F. S.

 3d     You know King David a man after  Gods own heart, made a mistake when  he numbered Israel, & would have  given the glory to them which belonged  to God. If left to ourselves we are  sure to make mistakes.    We must be fit temples  for this holy spirit or we are not worthy  instruments to do this work, and  when accomplished who has the  praise or glory. Is it not the operator.  What would our efforts accomplish  without His help.    We read in Doc. & covenants  In the secret chambers they are   planing your destruction and  you know it not. Yet we know  the God of heaven and earth overrules  our destiny, yet we must be humble and  give heed to the wisdom given us.    We read in Luke 10 chap  when the seventies returned saying, Lord  the devils are subject to us through  thy name. Jesus said rejoice but  not that they are subject to you,  but rejoice that your names are written  in heaven.

Sept 1st. 189    Mr. Wilford Woodruff,  President Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    Salt Lake City.    Dear Sir:    The Irrigation Congress, which is to meet in Salt  Lake City, on September 15th, 16th, and 17th, 1891, ais  attracting wide-spread interest and promises to be very largely  attended by representative people from all of the western states  and many others from the east. In order that strangers in the  city at that time, may be given a proper idea of Salt Lake City  and her people, the General Committee of Arrangements has thought   that there would be no better way of accomplishing that result  and at the same time, affording our visitors an enjoyable  event, than to have the Choral Society and other musical  organizations of the city, give a grand Musical Festival,  in the great tTabernacle, on the noight of Thursday, September  17th, 1891.    With that idea in view, the Directors of the Choral  Society have been requested to arrange a Festival, this they have  consented to do, provided the consent of yourself and  associates can be obtained for the use of the Tabernacle on  that occasion.    Accordingly we take pleasure in requesting that you will  grant the use of the Tabernacle as above indicated. This  Musical Festival is to be complimentary to members attending  the Congress and in order that they may cover expenses the  Choral Society merely wishes the privilege of charging a  nominal popular price of admission.    Hoping that this request may meet with your favorable  consideration, we remain,    Yours Most Respectfully  Jno W. Donnellan  Chairman General Committee of Arrangements.    Frank K. Gillespie.

Dear Brother:    In the latter part of the summer I was  asked if ^I^ would accept a mission to  Scandinavia to labor in the literary department.  I answered yes, and was thereupon informed  to report to you as soon as I was ready after  the 1st of Nov.; I therefore feel it a duty to  give an account of myself. In the intervening  time I have, upon a complaint sworn to by  marschal St John, been arrested for unlawful  cohabitation and put under $1000 bonds. I  waived examination before the Commissioner  and the case is now before the Grand Jury.  They have no case and I do not fear the is-  sue; but for the time being I am, of course, not  at liberty. When that time again arrive I will  take pleasure in so informing you.    The girl, who they claim is my plural wife,

They spit  upon him; and bound him with  cords & put him in prison without  food for days. Yet he firmly believed  the Lord would give him success.  He did so. The understanding of those  Lamanites was touched by the Spirit  of the Lord; they saw the subject in  its own true light. They repented &  buried their weapons of war. They  would suffer death rather than sin  by sheding blood. Now Ammon could  not do this, yet he was the instrument  by which the Lord could do it, and  we give God the glory.

I have explained matters to Prest. Lor.  Snow, who will probably see you at an early date.    Whatever you brethren think best in re-  gard to the proposed mission, I will try to  meet to the best of my ability.    I can take the general missionary labor,  in which I have spent nearly 6 years previously,  as well as not; but if the mission selected for  me is still open, I would prefer it on account of  the literary training it affords, and it will also  allow of some missionary labor at intervals.    Circumstances do not force me abroad,  but I leave it entirely with you as to mission or no  mission, and where, when, and what.    Yours in the Gospel,  N. P. Anderson.    [sideways text] Bro.

Snow hasve  explained matters relative to my mission to you  before this time. Some of the brethren here are  considering the advisability of me leaving my  public obligations in the present shape, as it  appears that none is prepared to relieve me, and  a little confusion might result from the change.  Another view is that if I should decline to "run"  again at the next election, when my term is  out, that would create susspicion; provided I  am around home. So far as, I am personally  concerned I wish only to say, that I have made  up my mind to do the will of the ^Lord^ and what-  ever He dictate through His servants shall be  my choice. I do not believe I say too much,   if I say that several of the brethren here wishes

I did not feel so dis-  posed, for, if I had dodged the issue, I would  had been considered guilty of all the crimes de-  fined in the Edmund-Tucker bill, and because  the prosecution had no chance to try the case,  it would, to some extend be charged to  the people, who support me in my official capa-  city, which would be very unfair.

We can love him as we ever have done  without this image, which would be  cap sheaf; a head of Isreal of old, who  never made an image for this purpose.    Will not the Lord withdraw  His spirit from us, as he did from Solomon  when he entered into Idolatry; then all  will be vanity and vexation of spirit  when we are left alone with our enemies    No we can not endure this:  rather let us cling to the iron rod which  teaches us, that God is the same yesterday  and forever.

 Your Brother in the Gospel,  Niels Jensen.    If bro. Jensen had sufficient  faith, no doubt he could  accomplish a good work  in his native land as a missionary,  and the Lord would strengthen  and perhaps heal him.    Unless he has faith to go, trust-  ing in God for health and  the good spirit to guide him  it would be useless for him  to go. And in that event I think  he should be released from  this call. J. F.
