 Merreott, Weber Co Utah Nobr 29th 1891President W.

This would have a tendency to turn the heartsof the people in that direction. I was, at one time,precsent in a meeting where pretty much all prayedwho wanted to, first one, and than another &there was a Spirit & power precsent like a burningfire and greate rejoycing. Many such meetings wouldundoubtedly prove ^to be^ a greate blessing to the people ingeneral. There is ^yet^ people, who think that we ar doing wrong in giving ^up^ principles in order to please theGovernment, people, who thinks the Lord would speedily

One man went so far as to say that the Savior would not come for the first two thousand years & that we would give up everthing to avoid percsecution, that the Church of Christ anciently became a beast * & that a second beast was to come up of the earth to take the place of this church before the final establishment of the the kingdom of God on the earth. A greate mistake. I have heard about one dussin instances that people have seen in their dreams armies arrayed against Zion and a batle fought. One young man has knowledge that he will be shot in that batle but the army was destroied as if by a whirlwind. One man sawthis three times in one night. A woman sa[w] a batle and at once she saw an army come down from heaven dressed in white and they came bewixt us and our enimies & the enemy disappeared. Now if I have* meaning a beast took is place

Theyare ignorant of the designs and pur-poses of God our Father; but Israelhas been taught, His laws, and willbe the instruments in His hands, to dothis great work, and perform this stra-nge act.

In order that strangers in thecity at that time, may be given a proper idea of Salt Lake Cityand her people, the General Committee of Arrangements has thought that there would be no better way of accomplishing that resultand at the same time, affording our visitors an enjoyableevent, than to have the Choral Society and other musicalorganizations of the city, give a grand Musical Festival,in the great tTabernacle, on the noight of Thursday, September17th, 1891.With that idea in view, the Directors of the ChoralSociety have been requested to arrange a Festival, this they haveconsented to do, provided the consent of yourself andassociates can be obtained for the use of the Tabernacle onthat occasion.Accordingly we take pleasure in requesting that you willgrant the use of the Tabernacle as above indicated. ThisMusical Festival is to be complimentary to members attendingthe Congress and in order that they may cover expenses theChoral Society merely wishes the privilege of charging anominal popular price of admission.Hoping that this request may meet with your favorableconsideration, we remain,Yours Most RespectfullyJno W.

They spitupon him; and bound him withcords & put him in prison withoutfood for days. Yet he firmly believedthe Lord would give him success.He did so. The understanding of thoseLamanites was touched by the Spiritof the Lord; they saw the subject inits own true light. They repented &buried their weapons of war. Theywould suffer death rather than sinby sheding blood. Now Ammon couldnot do this, yet he was the instrumentby which the Lord could do it, andwe give God the glory.
