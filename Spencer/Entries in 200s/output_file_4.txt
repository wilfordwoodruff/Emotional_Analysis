We repeated to him what we had be- fore said in letters respecting money that had been advanced to him, that we were startled when he asked for Twenty-five thousand dollars more, without giving us the least idea as to what had been done with the Fifteen thousand which he had already re- ceived, or even making plain to us how the Twenty-five thousand was to be expended. Forty thousand dollars was a large sum of money, and in our position we could not possibly advance it without understanding more about it than we did. He expressed himself that our present line of action was not likely to be favorable for admission this session, or even next session. It is clear from what he said that he thinks our ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, January 22nd, 1896.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff and Counselors, City,  Dear Brethren:  Since our conversation with you yesterday, and the agree- ment which was then made for the formation of a syndicate, and having heard the expressions of yourselves and Brethren that you desired some arrangements made whereby your mining properties in Southern Nevada might no longer be a burden to you, which they have thus far been, we have given the subject careful consideration, and hereby make the follow- ing proposition to you for the management of the Sterling and Confidence  properties:  We will assume charge of both of these companies if you desire it on the following conditions:  (1) You are to temporarily carry the financial obligations which you have already contracted for this property, allowing us such reason- able time as you may think proper to allow for us to place the mines under competent supervision and management, when we guarantee to gradual- ly relieve you of the debts incurred on these properties.  (2) We are to receive the unsold treasury stock for division among the four members of the syndicate who now have no fincancial interest in the company, viz: Frank J. Cannon and Abraham H. Cannon, who are to receive equal shares of this stock, which amounts to about four thousand shares; also an equal share in any other stocks which they^,^ with your moral influence^,^ can induce Brothers Orson Smith and J. E. Langford to donate, in view of the fact that we are to assume all financial burdens with your heo^l^p, and to take active manage- ment of the company's affairs.  (3) The sale of any or all of the property is only to occur with your full approval and under your advice.  Our intention is, should this proposition be acceptable to you, to immediately secure capable men to locate at Sterling and Confidence. These men we would expect to for^e^see and provide for all necessities of  the company so that the mills might be kept in constant operation. We would expect weekly reports from them, and all accounts, either for wages or supplies would be paid direct from this city, where the accounts,  ENDENTRY and Wilson, upon receiving your telegram requesting an answer, a reply was sent rather favoring the employment of Mr. Wilson. Afterwards, on receiving your communi- cation and seeing the shape things were assuming in Washington, we thought it would be better not to employ him at the present time, if you had not already done so. We presume, however, that you probably had done so before we sent the second telegram.  We gather from your remarks that Brother John W. Young has had several persons whom he has retained, and to whom he has been giving pay. It is just as well that you should keep as clear from them as you can consistently with the honorable fulfillment of any arrangements that he may have made.  As for Mr. Curtis, we think that his connection with us had better cease at the close of the year, which, we suppose, will be on the 15th May, ac- cording to his statement. It would be well probably for Bro. F. S. Richards to notify him to this effect,  ENDENTRY present method of operations will not result in accomplish- ing the end we have in view. He thought political re- sources ought to be exhausted before missionary work should be engaged in. Upon being interrogated as to what he meant by this, he spoke in a vague sort of a way about the nine Senators who had met at Senator Call's, and that they ought to have been kept together and more added to them, and they made missionaries for us, to convert others; and in this connection alluded to excursions which they frequently took and dinners which they often had together, and that they ran in "sets", and that in this way one might be made to convert the other. We could not see why the present action of the brethren in visiting Members and Senators and enlightening them concerning the true position of affairs in Utah should interfere in the least with such a plan as he had in view, and asked him how this could interfere; why the two plans could not work harmoniously. Upon this point we did not get ENDENTRY you can.  The land boom here is the chief excitement we have among us at the present time. It amounts to almost a craze in some quarters. The city is full of people buying land or talking about it. Real estate agents are multiplying on every hand. Prices have gone up wonderfully. Some idea of the infatu- ation that has seized upon the people can be formed by noticing an item in last Sunday's Herald, in which it was stated that 32 acres near Geo. Q. Cannon's were sold for $600.00 an acre. You know what kind of land it is in that vicinity and how little value it possesses intrinsically for farming or for residences.  The Legislative Assembly had a very pro- tracted legislative day; it did not close until just after midnight on Saturday night, the 10th inst. While the Assembly were not able to gain every point they wished, still, on the whole, there is reason to be satisfied ENDENTRY Nauvoo May 16th, 1843  Dear Father  I have had it in my heart for a long time to write a Letter to you and express my  feelings to you upon a few Items but I have delayed it untill the present time.

Seth is the man that they have been urging and are still desirous to obtain; but it was suggested that if he was likely to miss, another man should be put forward that could be relied upon. Whether this man is the one or not we cannot say; but we shall learn as quickly as possible.  We are glad that the brethren are able to reach such men as Senators Pugh and McPherson and correct the misconceptions which they entertained concerning us and our conduct, and we trust that the effect will be better upon them than the interview with Senator Davis appears to have had on him  We meet on all sides expressions of regret at the utterances of the speakers at Conference.

It is amid such reflections that I take up my pen to address you in answer to a letter  that fell into my hands last Evening which I re^a^d which I  with  great Delight and thanksgiving to God to again hear from you and learn  that you and the rest of my friends were in the land of the living. The  l^e^tter alluded to from under the hand of my Mother Dated June 20th  was interesting to me I was truly rejoiced to hear from so many of  my friends and in answering your letter I asked my Heavenly  Father in the name of Jesus Christ FIGURE to inspire my heart and pen while I write for who does not need wisdom to write and speak when all of  their words will be recorded upon the Archives of heaven to be read in the day of Eternity. Firstly I would say I am still enjoying the best of  health which blessing I am sorry to hear my Mother is depreived of. Also my peace is like a river and my my righteousness be like the waves  of the Sea allthough persecution of a dark aspect threatens me with  a bold front upon my right and left yea scourgeings and death we  are threatened with we have to contend with with idolatry, superstition, liings,  Prejudice, Priestcraft, and spiritual wickedness in high places yea in places whare I have been preaching the fulness of the gospel of Jesus  Christ and nothing els the County Clerks Sheriff's co^n^stables, Esqrs, Priests of different denominations with drunkerds thiefs murderers manslayers are combined together in the face of all law human or Divine against me and my Brethren with me in the ministry  in this country for no other reason but preaching the true gospel  of the Son of God and some of them in their blind zeal have falsly sworn  things against me the date of which was months before I step'd  into the State. But none of these things moove me for I know  that my Redeemer lives and while kind heaven sends me breath and a dying people to be warned I will not shun to declare the whole council of God. Perhaps the question may arise in your minds why all  this opposition to me and to others belonging the Church of Latter Day Saints if  we are the people of God the question Answer is at hand because God hath chosen us out of the world theirfore they hate us as they always have the Saints ##John 15:19|John XV:19##.

He evidently thinks, and so expressed himself, that money is the all-important factor to be used. Upon this our views were expressed with great frankness, that we did not believe in a money campaign; we had not money enough, we thought, to spend in  the way he indicated. While money is doubtless nec- essary for various purposes, and might be used judiciously to aid men who are in straits, to use it as he proposed was entirely contrary to our feelings and we think it most impolitic. It would undoubtedly make the "lobby" hungry, and it would come to the knowledge of these acute fellows that we were spending money. No man could receive it scarcely without somebody being aware of it. He did not agree with us on this; he thought that his method of using means would only be known to himself and the parties. He appeared to think that the great difficulty with him was that he could not sit down and write and explain things as other men did; he was more for action; and it was to this that ENDENTRY with the success which they had with the Governor. He yielded more than our folks did, and most of the members felt very well satisfied with what they gained. There has been a disposition, however, to expend more lavishly than our funds would altogether warrant; but one heavy expense was cut off—that asked for by the Directors of the Insane Asylum. The members were firm in resisting this, though the Governor had been lobbied with by friends of the Asylum to veto the  Appropriation bill unless the amount they asked for should be inserted. Doubtless the action of these lobbyists contributed to the veto in the first place of the Reform School bill and the Agricultural College appropriation. The banking bill passed, but not in as good shape as we would like; still it is thought we can organize under it.  Steps will be taken to have proper credentials sent down for our sisters to represent our Territory in the approaching convention. ENDENTRY Our friends declare that great injury has been done by what was said, and they expressed a feeling of shame, because these utterances seem to put them in the position of having made false statements. No one could have been more surprised at these utterances than ourselves and a number of the brethren of the Twelve, because it was understood that care would be exercised upon these points.  We have just received a letter, signed by your- self, Bros. Richards, in relation to getting delegates to the National Convention. The suggestions which you make about Hadley D. Johnson have been considered; but it would be impracticable, it is thought, to use him. We are taking other steps to see if we can effect something in the direction which you mention. We think it very important that this matter should be attended to, and that no pains should be spared to prevent the insertion into the Democratic Platform of anything reflecting upon us.  ENDENTRY he attributed his lack of explanations concerning funds and other matters. He freely acknowledged that he had not done right, and that he could not blame us, under the circumstances.  Just before we parted he mentioned that he had in contemplation the organization of a  National Bank in Utah. He said that he had had  conversation with the Comptroller and had endeavored to get the privilege of calling it the National Bank of the State of Utah; but that for political reasons this had been deemed unwise. He said that he had much to say on this subject; but as we had not time to listen, it was deferred. He intimated, however, that the little bank and his bank might work in har- mony and control affairs. Of course, we had very little to say upon this subject, as we did not know enough about his plans to answer except in a general way. We feel as you do, that all his transactions here should be explained, and we shall do what we  ENDENTRY blank ENDENTRY It has been amid these Reflections that I have desired in my heart that my Sister, and Kindred  might not ownly stand in the Everlasting Covenant but be gathered with the Saints and inasmuch as they sleep that thay may sleep in the burial place of the Saints that we may lie down together and rise up together in the morn of the first Resurrection.

W Woodruff ENDENTRY AN EPISTLE OF THE TWELVE, TO THE BTETHREN SCATTERED ABROAD ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA, GREETING: BELOVED BRETHREN,   It seemeth good to us to write unto you at this time  concerning the great things of the kingdom of our God,  and more especially as we have been called upon by the  late General Conference so to do; that the work may  not be hindered, but that all may understand their privi lege and duty in this day of glorious events, so that by  exercising themselves therein, they may attain unto  those blessings which God has in store for his people in the last days.   We have abundant occasion, and we rejoice exceed- ingly at the privilege we have had of beholding so many  thousands of our brethren and sisters as were assembled at the late conference, and for the most perfect harmony  and good feeling that prevailed throughout all their  deliberations; for the great amount of valuable instruc- tions by President Joseph Smith and others; and for the  disposition which we have seen manifested by all who  were present to carry into effect all those noble plans  and principles which were derived from heaven, and  have been handed down to earth, to carry forward the great and glorious work which is already commenced, and which must be consummated to secure the salvation of Israel.   While the minutes of the General Conference are be- fore you, which will be read with interest by every lo- ver of Zion, we shall recapitulate some items, and detail  more particularly to the understanding of those who had not the privilege of being present on that interest- ing occasion, the past, present and future situation and  prospects of the church, and the stakes, and those things which immediately concern their best interests.   A short time since and the saints were fleeing before  their enemies. Whips, imprisonments, tortures and death stared them in the face, and they were compelled  to seek an asylum in a land of strangers. They sought they found it within the peaceful bosom of Illinois; a  State whose citizens are inspired with a love of liberty; whose souls are endued with those noble principles of charity and benevolence which ever bid the stranger  welcome and minister to his wants: in this State, whose  soil is vieing with its citizens in all that is good and lovely, the saints have found a resting place, where,  freed from tyranny and mobs, they are beginning to real- ize the fulfilment of the ancient prophets, "they shall  build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat  the fruit thereof, having none to molest or make afraid."   In this city the church has succeeded in securing sev- eral extensive plots of land, which have been laid out in city lots, a part of which have been sold, a part has  been distributed to the widows and orphan, and a part remains for sale. These lots are for the inheritance of the saints, a resting place for the church, a habitation for the God of Jacob; for here he has commanded a house to be built unto his name where he may manifest himself unto his people as in former times, when he caused the  temple to be reared, and the cloud and the fire to rest down thereon; and not that the temple be built only, but that it be completed quickly, and  that no more general conference be held, till it shall be  held therein; and that the Nauvoo House be finished for the  accommodation of the brethren from afar, and the stran ger who shall come up hither to inquire after the work of the Lord and worship in his Temple.   Scores of brethren in this city, have offered to board one and two labourers each till the Temple is completed; many have volunteered to labour continually, and the brethren generally are giving one-tenth part of their  time, or one-tenth part of their income, according to cir- cumstances; while those sisters, who can do nothing more, are knitting socks and mittens, and preparing gar- ments for the laborers, so that they may be made as com- fortable as possible during the coming winter. In view of these things we would invite our brethren for many  miles distant around us, to send in their teams for draw- ing stone, lumber, and materials for the buildings; and at the same time load their wagons with all kinds of grain and meat, provision and clothing, and hay and provender  in abundance, that the laborer faint not, and the teams be made strong; also that journey men stone cutters, andc. come, bringing their tools with them, and enlist in the glorious enterprise.   Most of the plats in this city before referred to, as well as several farms and large lots of land in this and the ad- joining counties are paid for. and are secured to the church by good and sufficient titles; while the town plat for the town of Warsaw, is secured on  such conditions that the brethren can be accommodated  with lots on very reasonable terms; but the large plat in Nauvoo, purchased by Messrs. Tuttle and Co. of New Haven, Conn., remains unpaid for, and the time has now arrived, when it is very desirable on the part of the church, as well as on the part of the gentlemen of whom it was purchased, that payment should be made and a warrantee title secured; to accomplish which we have been called upon by the united voice of the Gene- ral Conference to address the churches in the eastern states, to advise with the brethren in those regions, and devise ways and means whereby this debt may be liqui- dated, Hotchkiss and Co. satisfied, the plat secured to the church, and the brethern in the east at the same time transfer their real estate from the place where it now is, to this city or region of country, according to their de- sire.   The contract for the "Hotchkiss purchase" in Nauvoo, consisting of upwards of five hundred acres, was entered into, on, or about the 9th of August. 1839, for the specified sum of fifty three thousand five hundred dollars, and se- curity was given to Messrs. R. H. Hotchkiss, Smith Tut- tle, and John Gillet, for the amount of the same in two notes of equal amount, one payable in ten years, and the other in twenty years from the date thereof, signed by Messrs. Sidney Rigdon. In August last, interest to the amount of six thousand dollars or upwards, had accumulated on sailnotes which it has not been in the power of the church to pay up to the present time. The nature of this purchase, and the situation of the church is such, that it is necessary that the notes should be taken up, the interest stopped, and a  warrantee title secured immediately; and a correspon- dence is now in progress with Messrs. Hotchkiss and Co. to effect this thing, and bring forward a final settlement.   But, say you, what can we do to accomplish this great and desirable object? Let the brethren in the eastern states, who have lands which they wish to dispose of, so that they may remove hither and secure to themselves an inheritance among the saints, either in the cities or farms in the vicinity, and are willing to have their lands in the east made over to Messrs. Hotchkiss and Co. towards the payment of the foregoing notes, communicate with us immediately, at this place,stating to us the extent and  value of their property. Then as soon as we shall have received communications concerning property sufficient to cancel the obligations, and the necessary prelimina- ries are understood with Messrs.Hotchkiss and Co. we will dispatch an agent to New Haven, to complete the nego- ciation, transfer your property, take up the notes, and secure a deed; and those whose property is thus trans- ferred can have the value thereof here, in city lots, or lands in the vicinity; and thus your property will prove  to you as good as money, inasmuch as you desire to emi- grate, and you will no longer be obliged to tarry afar off, because that money is so scarce you cannot sell and get your pay. If there are those among you to whom God has given in abundance, and they desire to appropriate some portion thereof for the beenfit of his people, for the redemption of Zion; for a blessing to the widows of those  who have been slain for the word of God, and been bu- ried in a well, for a sustenance for their fatherless chil dren, and provide for them a habitation, they cannot do it more effectually than by devoting a portion of their sustenance towards liquidating this claim.   To those brethren who live so far distant that they cannot send in their loaded teams,and yet desire to assist  in building the Lord's house, we would say, gather  yourselves together and bring of your substance, your silver, and gold, and apparel, and of your superabundance cast into the treasury of the Lord and see if he will not pour you out a blessing till there is not room enough to  ceive it.   Brethren, the blessings of the kingdom are for you, for  the body of Christ, for all the members, and God will  help those who help themselves, and bless those  who will bless each other, and do as they would be done  unto. The gold and the silver is the Lords; all the trea- sures of the earth, the flocks and the herds of the fields and the cattle of the thousand hills are his; if he were  hungry would he crave thy food, or thirsty would he  ask thy drink? Nay: he would only ask that which was his own, he would feast on his own flocks, and quench  his thirst at his own springs. This God is the God of  the saints; he is your God, and he has made you stewards of all that has been committed to you, and will require  his own with usury; and will you not be faithful in a  little that you may be made rulers over many cities?  Yes, you will, we know you will.   The journeyings and gatherings, and buildings of the saints are nothing new, and as they are expecting, look ing, and praying for the completion of the dispensation  of the fullness of times, they must also expect that their  progress will be onward or they will be of no avail, for  what is not of faith is sin, and can you believe that God  will hear your prayers, and bring you on your journey,  gather you, and build your houses, and you not put forth  one hand or make one exertion to help yourselves? No; therefore inasmuch as the saints believe that father  Abraham journeyed to a distant land, at the command of the Highest, where himself and household (whose house- hold we are, if we keep the commandments) might en- joy the fruits of their labors unmolested, and worship  the God of heaven according to the dictates of their own conscience and his law. That his seed afterwards gath- ered to David was  commanded to build a house, where the son of man  might have a place to lay his head, and the disciples be  endued with power from on high, and were with one ac- cord in one place; they must also believe that this dis- pensation comprehends all the great works of all former  dispensations; and that the children must gather as did  the fathers; must build a house, where they may be en- dued, and be found together worshipping and doing as  their fathers did, when Jehovah spake and the angels of  heaven ministered unto them; and if these things are  not in this generation, then we have not arrived at the dispensation of the fullness of times as we anticipate, and our faith and prayers are vain.   Is it possible that we labour in vain, and toil for nought,  and that we shall be disappointed at the last? No, we  know assuredly that the set time to favor Zion has come and her sons and daughters shall rejoice in her glory.  The time has come when the great Jehovah would have a  resting place on earth, a habitation for his chosen, where  his law shall be revealed, and his servants be endued from on high, to bring together the honest in heart from  the four winds; where the saints may enter the baptis- mal font for their dead relations, so that they may be judged according to men in the flesh, and live according to God in the spirit, and come forth in the celestial king- dom; a place over which the heavenly messengers may watch and trouble the waters as in days of old, so  that when the sick are put therein they shall be made  whole; a place where all the ordinances shall be made  manifest and the saints shall unite in the songs of Zion,  even praise, thanksgiving, and hallelujahs to God and  the Lamb, that he has wrought out their deliverance, and bound Satan fast in chains.   What then shall we do? Let us all arise, and with one united mighty exertion, by the strength of Israel's  God, oppose the powers of darkness, and every being  and principle that may rise up against us, and complete  the work already commenced. Let us not for a moment  lend an ear to evil and designing men who would sub- vert the truth, and blacken the character of the servant  of The Most High God, by publishing abroad that the pro- phet is enriching himself on the spoils of the brethren.  When brother Joseph stated to the general conference the amount and situation of the property of the church, of which he is trustee in trust by the united voice of the church, he also stated the amount of his own possessions on earth; and what do you think it was? We will tell  you. His old horse Charley, given him in Kirtland; two pet deer; two old turkeys, and four young ones; the  old cow given him by a brother in Missouri, his old Ma- jor, dog; his wife, children, and a little household furni- ture; and this is the amount of the great possessions of that man whom God has called to lead his people in these last days; this the sum total of the great estates, the splendid  mansions and noble living of him who has spent a life of  toil and suffering, of privation and hardships, of impris- onments and chains, of dungeons and vexations suits,  and every kind of contumely, and contempts ungodly men could heap upon him, and last of all report him as  rolling in wealth and luxury which he had plundered  from the spoils of those for whose good he had thus toil- ed and suffered. Who would be willing to suffer what he has suffered, and labour near twenty years as he has done, for the wealth he is in possession of?   Brethren, in view of all these things let us be up and  doing. Let those in the eastern States use all diligence in communicating to us their ability to assist in the Hotchkiss payment, being assured that no exertion they can make, will equal what has already been made for you and the church generally;and let all the saints come up to the places of gathering, and with their mites and their abundance, as God has given them in trust, help to  build up the old waste places, which have been thrown down for many generations, knowing, that when they  are completed, they will belong unto the people of the  Most High God, even the meek, the honest in heart, he shall possess all things in the due time of the Lord. Be not covetous, but deal in righteousness, for what the saints shall not possess by purchase and in righteous- ness they shall not possess, for no unrighteous thing  can enter into the kingdom; therefore, beloved breth- ren, deal justly, love mercy, walk humbly before God, and whatever your hands find to do, do it with your  might, keeping all the commandments, and then, whether  in life or in death, all things will be yours, whether they be temples or lands, houses or vineyards, baptisms or  enduements, revelations or healings, all things will be yours, for you will be Christ's and Christ is God's.   BRIGHAM YOUNG, HEBER C. KIMBALL, ORSON PRATT, LYMAN WIGHT, JOHN TAYLOR, WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEO. A. SMITH, WILLARD RICHARDS. Nauvoo, Oct. 12th, 1841. ENDENTRY To the Bishops and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Residing in the various Settlements throughout these Mountains:  BELOVED BRETHREN AND SISTERS:  The Temple at St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory, rapidly approaches completion. Already some portions of it are in a condition to be used, and in a few weeks we expect to be administering ordinances therein for the living and the dead. The General Con- ference of the Church was adjourned on the 8th instant to hold its next session at 10 A.M. on the 6th of April in the Temple at St. George. We hope the entire building will be com- pleted by that time and that we shall be able to dedicate it to the Lord, our God. In the days of our poverty, and while we had no Temple in which to administer ordinances for the dead and to give endowments and to perform sealings and other ordinances for the living, the Lord permitted us to erect an city. This we have used for many years, and many ordinances have been administered therein; but there are other important ordi- nances which have not been, and cannot be, administered, except in a Temple built and dedi- cated to the Most High for that purpose. Such a Temple we now have so far completed at St. George that we can commence attending to these ordinances there. The mind of the Spirit to us has been that we should, for the present at least, discontinue in the Endowment House in this city the work of baptisms for the dead, of giving endowments and of sealing, and that, hereafter, these ordinances should be performed in the Temple, or the Temples that shall be built. This announcement we have made to the Saints. They have been profoundly moved thereat. They are aroused to action. They now begin to appreciate how precious are the  opportunities they have had. Never before has there been such an anxiety displayed for the privileges of the Endowment House. The prospect of it being closed causes the people to think of their baptisms, endowments and sealings. They now perceive, as probably they never did before, how convenient it would be to have a Temple completed in this part of the Territory. This would save them the lengthy journey to and from St. George. The want of Temples at other convenient points to which the Saints can repair to receive their ordinances will now be felt at other places besides Salt Lake City. Especially will this be the case where persons wish to marry. The Lord has taught us how important it is that our marriages should be solem- nized according to the laws He has given, in holy places, where wives can be joined to hus- bands for time and all eternity. What Latter-day Saint can be satisfied with any marriage or authority less than this? Which of them, if he understands the laws of God, can feel indifferent as to whether his wife shall be his for eternity or for time only; or whether his children shall be born in the covenant and be legal heirs to the priesthood or have to become such by adoption? It is for these and other ordinances that we are commanded of the Lord to build Temples. We are now abundantly able to build them, and in them should the ordi- nances be administered which have been acceptable only in the days of our poverty in other places. At an holy altar in the Temple of the Lord can ordinances be administered to those who are deemed worthy which they cannot receive elsewhere.  We feel led to say to the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains: Let us arise and build Temples unto our God at such places as He shall designate, into which we and our children can enter and receive those blessings that He has in store for us. Let the Bishops of the settlements in San- pete and Juab Counties call the people of their Wards together and ascertain from them how much each one is willing to subscribe in labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annual- ly, towards the erection of a Temple at Manti, Sanpete County. Let the Bishops of the  Wards in Weber Counties call the people of their Wards together and ascertain from them how much each one will donate in labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annually, towards the completion of the Temple in this city. Let the Bishops of the various Wards in Rich Counties in Utah Territory, and in the Counties of Idaho Territory, call public meetings and learn from the people what each one is willing to do, monthly, quarterly or an- nually, towards the erection of a Temple at Logan, Cache County. And at these meetings the amount each person shall subscribe should be placed opposite his or her name, so that what can be depended upon may be known in writing. Each Bishop can then make a state- ment over his own signature to the President's Office of the amount of labor and means that his Ward will furnish in the aggregate and that he will be responsible for.

Elder Adams is I understand a going to hold a debate in Backellon and then return to Nauvoo ENDENTRY In proposing the erection of new Temples, it is not expected that the work now being done upon the Temple in this city by individuals and by the various quorums shall cease. The labor upon the Temple here will continue to be pushed forward by those now en- gaged in it until sites are selected for, and work shall be commenced by the different quorums upon, other Temples. These Temples which we now propose to build will not be costly struc- tures. They will be for Endowment purposes, and can be easily and quickly erected by the people from whom the labor is required. You will perceive, by the anxiety of the Saints to avail themselves of the privileges of the Endowment House in this city, and the manner in which they are now crowding here, how necessary and desirable it is that these buildings should be speedily completed, so that the facilities for sealing and the administration of other ordinances should be placed within the reach of all who are worthy of them without their be- ing compelled to travel to and from St. George to the Temple there. When the Saints were required to build the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, they were few in number and poor in means; at Nauvoo also, when the Temple was erected there the Saints were not numerous, and their circumstances, as contrasted with ours in these valleys, were those of great poverty. But in rearing those Temples the people were greatly blessed. The Lord increased their substance, provided ways of deliverance from their enemies, and bestowed gifts and knowledge upon them which are beyond all earthly price. So it will be now, if we will arise in the majesty and strength of our calling as the people of God, and build these Temples with willing hearts and  liberal hands, the Lord will pour out His blessings upon us to an extent we have never here- tofore known. Our children will multiply and increase in faith, and though Satan may rage, as he and his servants always do when the work of building Temples is being urged forward, yet we will prosper and grow stronger and stronger until the redemption of Zion shall be fully accomplished. Peace be with you, and Lord bless you.  Salt Lake City, U. T., 25th October, 1876.  BRIGHAM YOUNG,  JOHN W. YOUNG, DANIEL H.

President Joseph F. Smith, Washington, D. C.  Dear Brother Joseph F.:  We have just sent you a dispatch concerning Brother Franklin S. Richards. His help is needed here very much. We did not, however, wish to  ask him to return without consulting you, and shall be governed by your answer. It ap- pears probable that every piece of property that the Receiver can by any possibility es- tablish a shadow of claim for will be seized by him. Besides the gas and the street rail- road stock, suit is entered for the part of the Tithing Office block sold by the Weber Stake Association. Suits have also been entered for the house occupied by Brother L. W. Shurtliff, and the Tabernacle square. There is a note given by Brother Shurtliff in fa- vor of Richard J. Taylor, upon which there is still $2000.00 due, with interest. This will doubtless be seized by the Receiver if he can get possession of it. We are informed that he intends to attack the Daniel H. Wells lot, no doubt with the design to claim that, and also the Council House corner and the old Constitution lot, and perhaps the Museum. Parley L. Williams is familiar with our business through his former connection with Le Grand Young and his general intimacy with our real estate transactions. The piece of land sold by Angus M. Cannon's name, has already been sued for. Where this will end it is difficult to say; but we feel the need of more ef- ficient help here. We are not strong in legal help, and our defence seems very feeble  ENDENTRY considering the magnitude of the interest involved.  We have just received Alopeke's proposition which you sent to us. We have it under consideration. It seems like a long time, however, to wait until after the election before he enters heartily into the work. We shall advise you as to our conclusions as quickly as possible.  As you will see by the papers, it has been decided to dedicate the Manti Temple on the 21st. inst. We do not expect there will be so large a gathering there as there was at Logan, because of the difficulty in reaching there, there being 15 miles of travel after leaving the terminus of the railway. There will doubtless be a heavy turnout from the Sanpete Stakes and other parts of the  Temple District. We ^, the council,^ have decided to place the Temple in charge of Brother Daniel H. Wells, and, if there shall be no objection, Brother Anton H. Lund will be his assistant. We think that Brother Wells can attend to this with good assistance, and that he will enjoy his labors. Of course, his health is not in a condition to admit of his doing very much labor; but his past familiarity with temple ordinances will enable him to render effic- ient service in directing affairs.  The "boom" does not excite the attention that it did awhile ago. In fact, we suppose it is dying out. Still a great many n^a^ncicipate a revival when the summer fairly opens and we have an influx of visitors. Up to the present, how- ever, it has been considerable of a bubble, though some have realized large prices for sales they have made.  Brother Erastus Snow has been very low, and for a time ENDENTRY his life was despaired of; in fact, it was freely said by the doctors that he would not  leave his room again alivi^e^. Those who administered to him, however, had a different faith; still his condition remained very critical. Brothers Seymour B. Young and a gentile doctor had tried to draw his water from him and had given it up or concluded that there was none to draw. Afterwards Drs. Benedict made him a visit, and Dr. Benedict succeeded in drawing upwards of half a gallon from him, which relieved him immensely, and under his skilful treatment Brother Snow has continued to improve, and the prospect is that he may live for many years yet.  Of course, you will see by the papers the result of the attempt of our brethren to affiliate with the Democratic party. Such treatment is  not very encouraging to our people. There are a great many worthless people connected  with the party, and in Ogden we are told that the Republican element is far superior to the Democratic in respectability.  The weather at the present time is very pleasant. The health of the people is good. We constantly remember you in our prayers and take deep interest in all that you write to us.

President Joseph F. Smith, Washington, D. C.  Dear Brother Joseph F.:  Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. we received upon our return from Manti, whither we went on the evening of the 13th. by special train to Nephi and from Nephi by carriage to Manti. Our purpose in going to Manti was to hold a private dedication of the Temple on the 17th. We reached there on Tues- day morning about four o'clock, and were occupied in attending to business, making preparations and in meetings until Thursday, when we met at ten o'clock and had a prayer circle, and at twelve I -President Woodruff- read the dedication prayer, there being twenty-nine persons present, including all the Apostles in the Territory except- ing Brothers John W. Taylor. We had a very delightful season, and everyone enjoyed himself exceedingly. We remained there until Friday at noon and then returned, leaving the brethren who could appear above ground to attend to the public dedication. The Temple is beautifully finished and reflects great cred- it upon all engaged in the labor of constructing it, and also those who furnished the means. It is a cause of unbounded joy to think that the privilege has been granted to us of completing another structure like this, in which the servants of God can enter to attend to the ordinances for the living and the dead.

Presidency and High Council of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion.  Dear Brethren:  It having been brought informally to the attention of the First Presidency that a paper had been prepared by the High Council of the Salt Lake Stake which Bros. Geo. M. Spencer were required to sign, and which paper Bro. Lambert, at  least, objected to sign for the reason that it would stultify him, it was deemed prudent under the circumstances by the First Presidency to get those of the Apostles who were convenient to join them in listening to a printed document which had been circulated among the stockholders of the South Jordan Canal Company by the three brethren above named; and to listen to a paper which had been prepared by the High Council for these three brethren to sign. Accordingly the First Presidency and President John Henry Smith, of the Twelve Apostles met at President Woodruff's Office on Monday, June 21st, and listened patiently to the reading of these two documents. Before doing so,  however, there were verbal statements made to them concerning both  sides of the question involved so as to throw light upon the position of affairs and the causes which led to the publication of this report by an auditing committee consisting of the three brethren above named. It appears from the printed document itself that this report which they made was rejected at a meeting held for the purpose of hearing it, by ENDENTRY been appointed by the Council to preside, with Brother Anton H. Lund as his assistant, and Brother D. D. McArthur and St. George to attend the dedication, and they will remain to assist for a short time until everything is got into working order. The Temple will pe opened for ordinances on the 28th. of May.  In my other letter to-day I expressed my feelings con- cerning the return of Brother Richards and St. Louis to attend the Con- vention. I need not therefore repeat in this letter respecting that matter. Whether Brother John W. Young will attend or not we do not know. He would like to be appointed  to go there, but we have not said anything to him upon the subject. If he should go, it will be because he desires to himself.  Upon receiving your dispatch for the umi tausani we telegraphed you that elima tausani had been given to C. for the same purpose with elima haneri for his private use. We thought it better to send you this information that you might be fully aware of what was being done and be able to represent the same to No. 3. We think you did well in putting the responsibilitu^y^ on them.  We hope that we shall get a good Chief Justice. We have heard of Roger Sherman before. The Bowers concerning whom you write, me think,  must be Powers, who, we hear, is being favored by Don Dickinson. We sincerely trust that he will never obtain another appointment to the bench or any other office in our Territory; for he is a most dangerous man because of his want of principle. ENDENTRY Brother George Teasdale has been terribly exercised over emigration matters, and his letters are full of descriptions of the anguish which he has suffered in consequence of the attempt to change the route. He seems to think that our attempt on this side to do business is a reflection on him, and that we have not that confidence in him that we have had in others at the same place. I hope you will write fully to him on this subject and keep him thoroughly advised, as  a good deal of the feeling that he has is due, we think, to misapprehension.  The health of Brother Erastur^s^ Snow is very precarious. We visited him last night and administered to him; but the description that we got from his wives of his condition and urine is really alarming. However, we exercise all the faith we can, and shall struggle for him to be spared to us. The presence and la- bors of such men are of exceeding value to us.  It seems that the Receiver is determined to get pos- session of everything that ever belonged to the Church, and they are pursuing their work with great vigor and an apparent determination to strip us of all they can.  We are having delightful weather at the present time, and the health of the people generally is good.

One of the views taken by the First Presidency and  Apostles was that the High Council in taking up this case had perhaps transcended the bounds assigned it, as this was a case in which legal questions were involved, the Canal Company being an incorporated company;  but this suggestion did not preevent the First Presidency and Apostles from listiening to the documents. After hearing them and exchanging  views it was deeply regretted by all present that this rejected report of the auditing committee ghad been put into print and circulated. Nothing appeared before us, however, to invaldiate the truth of the report,  especially in view of the statement made: that those who were accused of  handling the funds improperly had since made arrangements for strainght- ening out the accounts complained of by the committee; neithder did any- thing appear before us as a reason why this report had been rejected by the stockholders' meeting above referred to. It is reasonable to suppose that as nothing appears making the correctness of the printed report at all questioenable, the committee which made it based it upon the fullest information at their command. Nothing appears, from all that is known, that this report was a false report; and while we regret  its publication, ^because^ we think the stockholders might have been informed of  all the facts without putting them into print; but, while expressing  ourselves to this effect concerning the publication of this report, we do not feel that the committee should be required to sign the paper that has been prepared by the High Council for their signature. We would ourselves shrink from signing such a paper under the circumstances; for  while it may be a fact that the reputation of some of the officers of the canal company has been damaged by the printing of this report; on the other hand, in correcting that wrong, if it be viewed as a  wrong, in the way proposed, we do not think it wise to create another ENDENTRY Miss Vedi Woodruff  My Dear Grand child We got your Loving Letter and was glad to hear from you and all the Children We took a ride on a small boat of 25 Mils in some 4 Hours I wish you had all been with us so you could see how fast a small boat could go through the sea All our Grand children would have been pleased with it if they had not been Frightened I hope you are all getting along Well at home We are Eating oysters, Clams and fish and some mutton chop living Well I have been out to the seal Rocks twice.

We think this would be injurious to them, and two wrongs never did make a right.  Our view, therefore, is that this matter should be arranged so as to correct whatever evil may have been done by the circulation of this printed document, and at the same time not injure the men who audited the books and who made the report from the books as they found them.

I am informed that my family is tolerably well for which I roejoice.  I had intended to answer your letter yesterday but I concluded to wait. I thank you for the council contained in your last.  Have not said any thing to the council concerning bro Arthurs case, but I think I shall have to do it yet. He seems to grow worse, last night bro Green proposed at his meeting a subs-cription to be entered into for Sarhah Duckwortah, a few shillings was collected. at the close of the meeting arthur stepped forward and said he would have nothing to do with it. The box he said was put in the room for those things and if they would break the order andc. they might take it into their own hands I thought it best not to notice him then, and went out to supper. when I returned again I found him railing amongst them andc. I told him that was not the place to complain of such things, we would hear it at the council friday eve andc. he shewed a very bad spirit—he is not one with us, but I want to be just and merciful. If you have any thing more on this subject it will be thankfully recieved before the council Have not yet took his licence.  Feel sorry to learn that there is something unpleasant at P again.  To your questions, I give council at your request according to the measure of the spirit and wisdom which God hath given me—If I err, Tis but me. To the first— "If a sister letts evil reports andc" and having been visited according to order by Elders yet will give no satisfaction either to them or the church" I feel to say I dont see how those Elders can be justified in not bringing the case before the council at least. I should say if they would not, they will be guilty of unfaithfulness andc 2nd The partys desiring the case to be put off—2 or more wks—when a case of transgression is clearly proved against them. They ought to be suspended from fellowship— untill satisfaction is made to the church.  3rd I should say it is not the privilege of any member who is known to be under transgression to partake of the sacrement untill satisfaction is made. And if an officer administers sacrement to such knowing the case andc. ought he himself not to be brought before the council.  4—If my wife was under transgression andc. I dare not plead her off—no more than any other member ENDENTRY such would be the council I should give, from the idea I have of the statement. Burslem and I am happy to say I received a letter on friday—the substance of which I will lay before you.  "We had a cold windy ride and got to B about 1/2 past 9 oweighs was conducted to Elder Cordons by a sister—was much pleased with my interview with the Saints—find bro Cordon very faithful and all the official members so far as I know. They have baptised 22 sinse potteries 66. Total confirmed 58. last week, (2 wk to night) their opposers flung the candles and candlesticks at their heads but notwithstanding one came to be baptised Bro Alfred baptised a Gentleman and Lady—on sunday morning and their servant a few days before. They keep a provision wharehouse in Hanley. We are again trying to get a door opened at Hanley. Do not know how much more warning the people will have in the potteries, neither do I know how long I shall tarry here. I feel as though the spirit will soon send one of us to Birmingham, can tell better in a few days. Love andc—Elder Turley—love—had quite a sore throat the day after their arrival. Yours andc. Willford Woodruff  This A.M. have recieved a letter from bro Taylor—tis quite a lengthy epistle— commences with love and blessing, after refers to the state in which he finds things in England, he refers to the sufferings of the Saints in America. Then states thus on Sunday morning they went to Aitkins Chapel and after the preaching bro Taylor asked permission to speak a little—they answered he had better speak to the leaders in the vestry. After meeting they retired into the vestry—They asked what sect he belonged to andc. He then gave his testimony andc in plain mild language and asked permission to preach in their chapel andc. They told him they has not authority to permit him andc. Many seemed affected. He stated they would hold a meeting last eve in owe of Aitkins preachers hereses. I suppose they have wrote you I have also got 2 letters from Lavender writes as follows "B. Jany 25—Dear brethren, my soul is grieved very much from what I hear about James Lea. Mr Rawlins has given me a letter written by a gentleman at Liecester who appears to have been a friend to Lea it reads as following. Sir I have read over a little of Lea's proceedings. he left Leicester with not less than from 30 to 40 soveriens of your money. when he went to pay Simpson his last rent he declared he saw as much as I have stated. Limpson Simpson said while Lea was ill he pleaded so much poverty and distress that he thought he had not one halfpenny to help himself. So I sent him several dinners and a bottle of wine thinking it was a deed of charity. Simpson said Lea on one occasion when taking his purse from his pocket, took out a handful of sovereins to the amount stated and said, Simpson I have a great many enemies in this place and I will leave it this day and I do not care a dam not a buggars for its vary name of the lot for I have plenty of money to carry me out of Leicester. Yours andc I find Dear brethren this is a task for me. Lea was a servant to Mr Rawlins ENDENTRY he expected Lea to give a proper account of what he had left him in charge wihth that at his coming he might recieve his own with usury. I feel I am not my own I am bought with a price even the blood of Jesus Christ, and as a servant I must soon give up my accounts. I desire and strive brethren to keep my accounts right with the Lord every day that I may meet him with joy. Lea could get away from his master but I feel always in the presense of mine and my desire is to live nearer still that I may be ready at any hour to give up my accounts. Last sabbath was a day for fasting and prayer with us. The Lord gave us a spirit to pray for bro and sis Lea and we hope after all they will repent like Peter. I think it will be the means of doing us good and makeing us watchful. The brethren and sisters appear to be doing well at this time and are looking out almost every day for one of the Elders who have come from America or our father Richards. We are but few and very poor yet we hope to see them soon if the Lord will. I find in the book of Doc and Cov that when a bro or sis breaks the laws of the land we are to deliver them up to the same. Mr Rawlins has been to me this day to know where Lea is and what he is doing and how he can write to him. I said I knew he was at Manchester a little time ago but I know nothing of him now. I sasid I will write down to know where he is and will call upon you in a feew days. So I depend upon you for this information by return of post that I may fulfil my promise I will enclose a letter written or posted by Lea on the 4 Dec last to show you how a man can act out of sight (yes a priest in the church of Christ) remember this his conduct at Leicester and the other his writing to me nearly at the same time had I not seen the accounts and letters and insolent notes that he sent to Mr Rawlins I could not have believed it but it is so plain I am compelled to believe it. Be pleased to tell bro and sis Lea I hope they will set at once and macke up the breach Love andc  Here follows an extract from the letter sent by bro Lea to Mr Rawlins Lavender Dear brethren and sisters in Christ—have many times rejoiced with you at Bedford andc but since that time I have many times ben led to ask myself what am I doing here doing the Devils work when called to labour in the Lord's vineyard with the servants of the Lord. I have many times dear bro as you wrote to me about drinking asmoking, singing and swearing and said if I was but out of this and enjoying myself with my Dear brethren and sisters singing the praises of God. After stating his grief on account of his present situation and epxpresing a hope of deliverance—he says I hope this has learned me a lesson not to give ear to man again knowing that the heart of man is decietful above all things and that the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. When I look at what I am brought to by giving bear to wicked men I take it as the judgement of God upon me. I know that I have sinned against my heavenly Father and I feel along way from heaven but I hope the Lord will bring me back again. after adverting to the wicked state of the world and their unpleasant situation and again expressing a hope that they will soon be delivered he concludes—Lov andc—  This is substance of the enclosed letter— ENDENTRY I have not time to look it over andc but I intend to give you a copy of the whole letter when I here from you again if you require it I intend writing to bro Fielding this P.

Dec 3rd 1844  President B. Young  Beloved Brother  Impressed with a deep sens of Duty toward God, toward you, and the quorum of Twelve and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I cannot leave the shores of America without unbosoming my feelings to you more fully than I have hitherto done; their has been a fire in my bosom that I have tried to smother in my communications to you concerning affairs in the Eastern Churches. I have done it fearing that you might think me an accusor of my bretheren, and that I should bring difficulty upon myself; but when I see an influence carrying Death in all its march instead of life, yea death like the upas tree, knowing the vary vitals of the Twelve and the Church, Laying the foundation of our cause, shall I hold my peace, No God forbid. It is true I spoke plain in my former letters but I ^feel to^ speak tplainer still. Their has been a time since the death of Joseph and Hiram and still is when we want men in the vy vineyard that are men of God that will act wisely, build the kindom, strengthen the weak, Deal with mildness act in concert with the Council in Nauvoo, and not acknowledge the head to be whare it is, But I must say that I do not believe Elders Wm Smith and G. J. Adams to be such men. I believe their whole influence has gone throughout the Eastern Churches to gratify their own propensities, rob the Churches for themselves, set themselves up as great men, to gain an influence unto themselves, crushed evry man that would not assist them to accomplish their end, ordain High priest and Exhalt men that would go with them and tried to the fulest Extent to have the power of the eastern Churches in the hands of men that would give them the influence. I have some reason to believe they have spent hundreds of Dollars of Temple money for their own use, and I believe the prophet in New York has been an Engine in their hands to accomplish the same End. The Churches they have visited the most are the worst of, and the Rigdon party have got more out of such Churches than any where els. A principle that they call the spiritual wife Doctrin is so instilled into the minds of most of the Elders whare they have been, that if any one says any thing against prattizing or preaching ENDENTRY Winter Quarters, Saturday Morn.

I have been in the midst of a number of fires in this Eastern Land. I have had to contend against Rigdon and his party on the one hand, and stretch out my hand on the other side with the greatest wisdom I could get to try to save the Church and the Elders from that that vortex of Recklessness unto which they seemed to be plunging through the influence of Adams. And all these things the quorum of the Twelve have to hear. I feel bad about the eastern Churches they are not out of Danger, the New York Church is in a bad situation, and to cop the climax Wm wrote a peace accusing Winchester of having a hand in murdering his brothers, and he has got out warrants for him, are about to take Brannan for printing it and have taken ^Elder^ Grant for selling the papers and he has been hand over to appear at court under $1000 dollars bond, and Adams has taken Winchester for Slander and all these cases will come up and be investigated to the fulest Extent the character of Hiram and the Twelve will be made as black through falshood as the Lawyers can make them and all Hell is raked over to ge testimony against the Twelve, and others Esspecially Wm Smith and Adams, and any imprudence that those men have to been been guilty of or any one els the Twelve have to learn it.  Wm and  Adams at times talk much about sustaining the Twelve but I think it ^is^ for Effect more than any thing els. Wm Smith told Elder Grant that the Twelve had not sustained him nor had he risen through their influence but on his own, neither should be ^fool himself bound hereafter to defend the character^ sustains ^of^ the Twelve or be ^Br Grant thinks he was some excited when he made these remarks^ accountable to that quorum but he was led by visions and revelations for himself and he said he and Adams was sworn friends and that Adams existance depended upon his. Wm has tried to gain an influence by saying that he was the last of the Smith family left that had land the foundation of the Church andc. But by careful observations I can see things crouding out that is leading to Apostacy and acting against our interest, God knows I dont want to Injure Br Smith nor Br Adams for the sake of the Smith family I went Wm said it possible But I know that you ought to be apprised of things as they are, and this is the reason why I thus write.

In those Churches whare they have held sway I could get but little or no assistance to help us on our mission If I could have borrowed the money I would not have asked for a dollar when I arrived in New York. we had ownly means enough to secure our passage but nothing to get provisions with and the N. York church raised us $2.50 two dollars and fifty cents to help us but they could help other men I ownly spent the sabbath with them, came to Philadelphia to hold one meeting with Elder Grant. I found him just right, with us with all his heart. and notwithstanding the former difficulthes the philadelphia Church is in the best order or as good as any man one East of the mountains that Adams and Wm has visited, and it is in a better state than ever has been since Winchester fraction. Elder Grant is a man after my own heart he is true in all things. his spirit is not congenal with Adams and Wm but goes with Brigham and the Twelve. Has Elder Smith sent up the $150 for the Temple from the Peterboro Church, and money he has collected from all the Eastern Churches, $20 or $25 from Vinson Shirtliff of Westfield. Elder Grant asked me if he should leave for Washington, or anywhere els, I think he has saved the Church in philadelphia I advised him to remind a little untill the difficulties are a little more over. give him council as you see fit, he will go whare you say. Beloved Brother I must close. I have written what I believe, keep an eye upon Br. Wm and Adams. When I get to England if men fight Rigdon and his party, introduce and practice the spiritual wife doctrin, for either of these if they dont repent I will cut them off. I will go with you, give me such council as you think best. I will follow it. If I am doing wrong in any thing tell me of it I will repent of it and leave it. (please take care of this letter let it not hurt me) my respects to  the quorum and all who inquire. Yours in the Love of God  W.  Elder. Young. the statements of Br.

I thank you for your kind feeling towards me. I prize the love of my family and wish to do what I can to make them comfortable but being called of God and the presidt of the Church to officiate in the spiritual things of the Kingdom it of course deprives me of takeing all the time for my family and spending my time with them. But I am satisfied that my mission to St George this winter will be of much benefit to me in many Respects. I was so worn down when I left home that I needed Rest, and the Blessing one may that I had received since I had ben here, the following are some of them. I had had the privilege of Dedicating the Temple on the lower portion of it unto the Lord. I have had the privilege of doing the first Baptzing, confirming ordaining giving the 2nd Anointings in the temple and have organized the working company, and am presiding over the Temple at in the labor therof. I have been an instrument in the hands of the  Lord in Revolutionizing the moral spirit of the City of St George when I came here there had not been but one Prayer Meeting, attended in the City for a year the was one a week, at ENDENTRY February 1, 1877  To Alice, My beloved children:  You have again the privilege of enjoying the society of your mother, and I am thankful for this. I want to give you all a word of council considering the signs of the times, the persecutive of our nation against us and at my own age you cannot reasonably expect to enjoy much more of my society as your father in this life, but you have with you your mother.  Now if it was the last testimony I was to give you on earth I want to  say be kind to your mother. You cannot always expect to have her with you, altho she may live a score of years or more, time will be short. Do not give way to anger, or say or do anything that you will be sorry for but I pray you be united with your mother and with each other and look after each others  interest.  Again I wish to say to you by children, thatIknow that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world, and he shed his blood to redeem us from death, and God raised up Joseph Smith as a true pro- phet of God, who brought forth the Book of Mormon, and laid the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth with which the Lord is well pleased. And the Church of Christ, and the Zion and Kingdom of God has been organized.  It is on the earth for the last time, and this church and Kingdom of God will stand and fill the whole earth and be thrown down no more forever.  Now you all hold this Church and Kingdom of God on earth, and I want you all  to pursue a course, so as to never be separated from the Church in time or Eternity, and as your father has been called to the apostleship which office I have held near 49 years and have also been called to stand as the President ENDENTRY with aboutt 2000 people inside I offerd the first dedication prays didicating all the lower part of the Erastus Snow, the room also and Young was so lame in his feet that He had to be carried  in a chair By 3 men all through the house but at last before we closed the power of God came upon him He arose from his chair walked unto the stand and spoke 30 Minuts in the power of God in the last sentence He uttered he struck the lowar stand with his hickory cane full of knots that sunk the knots into the solid wood so deep that they will remain there for a generation if their holes are not filled up.

Rev May 3 1861 file in our pigeon hole  end of sideways text  Sacramento, Cal. April 13 1861  Dear Brother Woodruff  I mail to day a letter to Pres. Clawson.  It is in accordance with my design, when  I set out, to limit my correspondence with  the city to br. Young; and indeed my oppor- tunities will not permit me to extend it; — therefore, dear brother, I do not sit down to  write you a letter; — not doubting but that  you will be informed of the contents of the  one addressed to the office; but to enclose  a newspaper slip, which came to my hand  after mailing the above letter. The article  "Brigham Young, and Louis Napoleon — a parallel," is a mere squib; and apparently hardly de- serving of attention; but it has some little  ENDENTRY significance to my mind, which may not be uninteresting to mention. In my frequent dis- cussions with the editors of this journal; and other editors of San Francisco, concerning the  political condition of the country; I have  had occasion to point out the "Chief of  Utah," sometimes in a jocular, sometimes in  an earnest manner, as the mood of the com- pany would permit, as the only man showing capacity to ride on the whirlwind of revolution,  and still the political storm. And I have  listened to frequent recognitions on the part of thinking individuals, that he was the  "only man for the times." This little newspa- per article, is the utterance of an editor, be- lieving more fully in the mission of sove- reignty of Brigham Young, than he dare express. You may expect startling revo- lutions in public opinions in California. Do not consider this a letter; but a postscript to Pres. Young's. Your bro. in the Gospel. W. M.

But I will appropriate these first few moments which I have been able ^to^ catch from my num- erous calls—to answer your very interesting questions? Let me say to you I am glad you took the liberty to propose them. I shall al- ways be ready to listen to any similar re- quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.  Your first question respects the Sabbath and its change.  God having finished his work of Creation in six days, ceased or rested therefrom on the seventh, and set it apart for the more solemn worship of him self by men, and as an emblem and pledge of their eternal blessedness. ##Genesis 2:1-2|Gen II 1.2.##  The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath, though we have no particular account of it.  The "End of days," when Abel offered their oblations, and The day when the sons of God met together in Job I.6## and ##Job 2:1|II.1.##  When Gods ancient people were fed with manna from  Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a double portion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbath which should be gathered and that none should be gathered on the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. ##Exodus 16:23|Exodus. 16.23## ENDENTRY Lines on the death of an Infant  How short is life! Tis but a transient glow, That's often dim'd by sublunary woe:— So short is life— So feeble is its beam, It scarcely glimmers ere its end is seen!  We've seen the Aged 'neath a weight of years, Resign their breath, and leave this vale of tears— We've seen amidst their glory and their prime, Dear friends, remov'd from all the scenes of time— We've seen the Youth both beautiful and gay, By sickness seiz'd, and borne by death away We've seen sweet Babes their tender eyelids close, Forget to weep—and sink in still repose: Cecilia too,— Dear Babe!— Her journey's o'er! She breath'd—she wept;— but she shall weep no more.  How short her time by providence assign'd! But fourteen days she was on earth confin'd ! Angelic bands her spirit did convey, To happier realms in everlasting day: Though latest born, she's first ariv'd at home, To see the splendor of the eternal throne.  Like some fair plant to chilling winds expos'd, (Before the tender bud its leaves disclos'd) Which pluck'd by gentle hands, was borne away, To some fair clime to bloom in bright array, ENDENTRY Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re- garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai. But to mark the perpetual and universal obligations of the observance of the Sabbath, God proclaimed the law of it from Sinais wrote it in a table of stone, a long with the rest which are allowed to be moral, ##Exodus 20:8-11|Exodus XX 8-11##. Injunctions to keep it and threatenings for the breach of it, are every where found in the law and  the prophets.  The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation— How is it changed from the seventh to the first day of the week?  In answering this question I would observe I. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh part of his time, rather than any particular day.  It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, kept the same day which they kept after that event.  Now it is certain that the same cronology was obser- ved at the giving of the law at Sinia, which had been observed before and after the flood.  But however cronology might alter, a seventh- part of the time would be the same in all ages.  II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORD of the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the First day of the week.  To mark the devine authority of this change, he on that day, made repeated visits to his de- ciples—##John 20:19-26|John XX. 19.26##. On that day he bestowed the mirac ulous gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost. ##Acts 2|Acts II.1##. ENDENTRY page torn she, thrice happy Babe By hands Divine, Was rais'd to bloom in a more healthful clime, Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, nor pain; But peace and joy uninterupted reign: Remote from ills, secure from earthly woe, Where chilling blasts are never to blow.  Cecilia! Lovely Babe!— Her infant frame No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain. She only sleeps!— Tho' motionless she lies, Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall rise, To shine in bliss most exquistitely bright,  Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.  And is she dead? O no! She enter'd life The moment she escape'd this world of strife: For here by tegious tedious flight the mind aspires, And thro' the sense all its skill acquires; And waits imprison'd, till by slow degrees, The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees, Or feels (by means of sense) the things around, Or harks, delighted, to the pleasing sound. But now from earth remov'd, her soul expands, And by the throne in holy rapture stands; Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streams, And basks delighted, in unsully'd beams; Now hears with wonder the melodious strain, And joins to celebrate Messiah's name; Her mind illumin'd, now with glad surprise, Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes. ENDENTRY III. This is called the LORDs day.  The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christ arose and to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation— says, This is the day which the LORD hath made let us rejoice and be glad therein.  John the Revelater calls the first day the LORDs day. ##Revelation 1:10|Rev. 1–10##.  IV The primitive christians met for public wor- ship and made their collections for the poor on the first day of the week. ##Acts 20:7|Acts 20.7##. ##1 Corinthians|Cor. 16##.  They also met on the evening of the first day of the ^week^ and their devine LORD repeatedly met with them.  I close these remarks by observing—That there is an alarming laxness among christian pro- fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. O that we might all awake to righteousness, on this subject.  In answer to your second question of^n^ the subject of miracles—I answer in general.  I. Miracles were wrought for a definite purpose—in the apostolic age—summari ly to establish the devine authenticity of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus. That object has been accomplished. The evi- dence arising from miracles alone, is clear— ENDENTRY Tho' while on earth, unnotic'd by her mind Were all the splendid scenes of human kind, She now perhaps from Sion's height sublime, Looks down and views the simple things of time; Or, if permitted, to the earth descends, And gladly mingles with her earthly friends: Altho' unseen, her happy spirit near, May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear, May with concern behold maternal grief, And fondly wish to soothe and give relief.  Sigh not surviving friends—let sorrow cease— She now inherits everlasting peace Tho' now you grieve, your grief shall turn to joy, And loftiest praise shall all your pow'rs employ: For when with you all earthly things are o'er, Beyond old Jordan's flood, on Caanan's shore, Your lovely Babe, with rapture fill'd shall stand, And shout your welcome to the promis'd land!  Douglas, 7 March, 1831. R. C. ENDENTRY convincing and overwhelming.  II If we should exercise strong faith in God, and live at the fountain head of holy influence that is—should we watch unto prayer, and pray without ceasing—should we daily fear to sin and daily deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow christ—should all professors of religion persue this course—doubtless a wonderfull change would be effected at once in the state of the church, but even in that case I do not see that the church would have any authority to attempt to perform such miracles, as were performed in the apostolic age.  They doubtless would shed their holy influence all around and be instrumen- tal in the conversion of thousands of souls, and the glorious Gospel would be spedily be preached to all who dwell upon the earth. For christians would feel that all they possessed is christ's and they would most cheerfully devote themselves their time, talents, property privileges, spirits, souls and bodyies—with their present all and all they ever expected—to the service of their dear LORD and master. Let us pray fervently my dear brother, that ENDENTRY The LORD would hasten this glorious state of the church.

I have not seen any of them or learned any of their names ^yet^ and report says that  there are 30 families more in Cincinata Ohio, on their way to Commerce. I was truly glad  to hear from you of your health and the prosperity of the work with you—your last  letter before this came to hand the middle of June dated April 24 you say you  sent me 4 letters since you arrive in Eng. I have received them all and have sent you 6 before this am verry sorry you have not received more  of them particularly my Jan. one in that I spare you a more particular acc- -ount of my situation and how things were with and around me and I  commenced this morn with a determination to tell you something more but  what shall I say I am almost inclined to pass over the past but as if I  cannot tell my dear Willford about my troubles who can I tell while those  around you me say I dont write anything to make him uneasey but I will give you a brief sketch of the situation of things with me who since you left me. — For 2 week after you left me I ejoyed quite good health then was taken with the fever and ague in a few days I was moved that is my bed and some other things out to brother Smoots where I had ^the best^ attention the house could afford although it had no floor in it or door or window—I was sick with the chills about 3 months and  little Sarah was verry sick to for days together I was not able to sit up to  have my bed made. I was reduced so low I remained there 8 or 9 weeks and  sister Smoot was taken sick my house was not done and it was with the utmost exertion that I could get any thing done to it if sister Taylor had  not moved into my room with sister Pratt in Montrose I thought of going there  but I did not blame her in the least about it I think she could not help it  as she was situated—about the forepart of Nov. they called it done it had no  door or window or loft in it the roof verry poorly laid on so that the snow and  rain came in verry plentifully the snow would be a number of inches deep and  mostly over the floor thus was my house finished when I moved into it and  I had the chill and fever then and could not sit up only apart of the  time and Sarah was unwell to I had a young girl with me 2 weeks then  she left me and then I had to do as I could with little Sarah cow and all  I did not sit up all day thong but got much slandered for haveing that girl so long ENDENTRY my house was exceeding cold with much of the daubing out of it and I was much troubled for wood I suffered much with my dear little Sarah for want of wood brother Avery in this neighbourhood was appointed bishop and when I asked him for any thing he was cross and would complain, so one day when my floor  was covered with snow and I had not one stick of wood or more fire than  could be put into a pint cup nor had I had any for about one week accept  some little sticks the children had picked up for me. I was sitting close in  one corner with a shawl on and my child under it to keep her from the snow which then came in on us and the weather was severe cold brother Pesly Clark called to see me and saw my situation he went home and told  his father and he sent for me immediately to come and make it my home at his house and made me as welcome as my fathers house he took my cow and  calf and kept them through through the winter—the people in Loovely street  was tired with me for not selling my calf some of them talked of making  me sell my clothes to provide for myself—but I trust those days are over  and they are kind to me here their family is large and I thought you would  certainly be home this fall but I am now fearful of it father Clark still tells  me to stay there untill you come home. My health grew better soon after  I went there and the most of the time I was comfortable through the winter sat up most of the time—On the 22 of march my babe was born for 2 weeks  I was comfortable then was taken with the chills which lasted me untill June in the time my babe was verry sick and had the hooping cough and seamed  near dying he has since that had 2 verry sick turns and is verry low now  I think it verry uncertain whether you ever see him in this world or not of the 16th of July our little darling Sarah was taken sick and died on the  17 as I have told you the particulars in a letter sent by L. Snow—since June my health has been quite good—before little Sarah's death I felt quite  reconciled to your absence although I have had almost one continued scene of  trouble since you left me—but since her death I cannot feal reconciled to  my situation I feell far more lonely than I have at all particularly now my  babe is so sick I have to bear my trouble alone no Willford or relative to  sympathise with me and can you tell me my dear companion who has  a better ^right to^ share to a part of your attention and kindnes than your best friend your absence renders me miserable indeed since last July had you been at  home I think our dear child might have been living but I forbear for  this is a heart rending subject to dwell upon. I must say that I want  you to come home exceedingly this fall if you do not know of a certainty that the Lord requires you to be there if so I suppose I must submit to it and if I  live, live through another cold lonely winter.

And as your papers have  been brought here and I am now about to take charge of them  I wish an understanding with you upon the subject  All that I have written to you heretofore upon that  subject I have said according to the statements made to  me by Elders Ward I know nothing about it  more than what they have said. In a letter I got from  Nauvoo I was informed that some one told you from Scotland that if he had known they were in this country he  could have sold them all. I dont know who the person was but who ever he might be I think he was mistake in that. I do  not know how great a little exertion the Brethren have  made here to sell them but they advertised them several times in the Star and Elder Hedlock says that in his travels through England and Scotland in all his conference, He spoke of them The Stars speak for thousands upon that subject.

Concerning the  Bell for the Temple I will to say that I will do all in my  power upon that ^subject^ I have made an appeal to all the Elders through the Star, and also made diligent Enquiry concerning the praice of the Bell and Duties on the same and we have also concluded to  try to furnish a clock as well as a Bell if it will be a agreeable. We will endeavor to furnish means to pay for both as soon as possible but now the question arises whether we these things canot be furnished to much better advantage in  America than in England for the Duties are vary high  they are 30 per cent I can get a Brass Bell 2000 lbs weight for about £140 about $600 dollars the duties on that in the United State a landing would be about £42 pounds or $204, this you see is a heavy amount for Duty, the whole would be £182, or— $about $800. We can the price of an Iron Bell would be about £20 $100 but I have no Idea that the Lord wants an  Iron Bell. As to a clock as to the price of a clock it would  depend upon what kind of one it was, whether it should have  one face or four whether lighted or dark some have thought that  one of the first quality would cost £100 or $500 but as you  said nothing about a clock I dont know whether you think of having  one or not, or whether you have made arangements for one  els whare. Now Br Young I wish you would ascertain what  a Bell can be obtained for in the United States and if by purchasing it there the duty can be secured so much the Better as it  will save $200 if the Bell can be purchased there we will forward ENDENTRY out of the preston Saints.

Elders L Hardy are the ownly Americans that are going home now the others I shall hold on to untill I get some more help, the work is generally much better than I could expect considering the few labourers in the Country. Ione or two Rigdonites has been through this country of late trying to esstablish Rigdonism but  every place as yet they have visited they have gone out of it as soon as they went in their care has been so prompty attended to by all Elders they have met that they consider their pilgramage a hand are getting weak in their faith and begin to deny their own calling at least are trying to palm themselfes off as Saints if others do not faire any better than those that have come it will not pay them for their trouble the truth is Rigdonism will  find hard work to ever find a foot hold in this land the Judgments of God are still in the Earth in the Easten world a dreadful whirlwind has desolated a spot in fFrance of late many lives and much property was lost. Asia Minor is desolated by famine ENDENTRY one of which I give to the Treasuer of each Branch or to each person that sends a donation to me if not through the book of the treasurer I also keep a duplicate of the same which remains in the Book, Besids this all the names is taken down in another Book with the sum each has given and as  much of it is penny and happing subscription it makes much writing then we have to draw a copy of the same to send to the Trustees in Nauvoo each 3 or 6 months as the case may be it is a vary safe but laborious way of doing business I have been stiring them up of late on the Clock and Bell and am in hopes they will be rather more liberal than they have been for I do not think they have been as forward in all respects in this county in the tithing as in America though I realized they are tithed and taxed and taxed and tithed from many others sourses than from the Lord  or his Saints, and then again they do not realize the importance as fully as they do in America as the Elders that are over the most of the Conferences and Branches do not feel as we do we have but few labourers in the field here at the prestent time that understand it properly we have but about half a dozen Americans in these whole dominions we want men who have recieved their Endowment. I have not been able as yet to travel a great deal among the churches wharever I have been I have strirred them up upon these subjets I have often thought I wished I had Elder Clayton with me to assist in business matters as well as preaching I recieved your request in a letter a long time since to send you a peace of linen and a Black Lace veil ENDENTRY Elder Ward has sold the Stars Bound for 3/6 and 4/ the  cvenants Bound are sold for 3/6 and all publications are  cheeper in England than in America and when they come to  see 9/ charge for the Times and Seasons ^unbound^ it frightens them  and as you allow for sale evry 10th Vol to agents I have  thought if you would allow them to be sold for 8/ I  would throw in my own trouble and try to get agents  that sell in the conferences and churches ^to^ do the same which  would mostly make up the loss. I wish you to informe  me as soon as you get this after considering all these things what you are willing to do whether you are willing to have them sold at 8/ or not  if you require 9/ per Vol for them I think it will take many years to dispose of  them for they have now been here over two years and ownly  £ 3,3,0 worth have been sold while the expenses and Duty  has been £ with the £ 5, sent you £22,13,9. If it was  my care property I would far prefer to sell them at 8/ or even some less than to have them lie on hand as they  probably would at 9/ but when you come to consider all these things if you say hold on to them at 9/ I  will do so. I will do by them as well as I would if  they were my own. I hope Br Taylor will not think  that I am wishing to dictate him concerning his property But I have done as I would wish to be done by in  making these statements.

I look upon it myself as a great omin of and evidence that the  time had come to favor Zion and that her Land  and light must and will sped spedily go forth propelled by the spirit and strength of the God of Israel untill Zion arises will all her strength power beauty and glory untill she fully accomplishes all that the Ancient  prophets anticipated yea I rejoice in the prosperity of all of which your letters speak My prayers have assended day and night before God that he would not ENDENTRY the means as fast as it can be obtained to pay for  the same as soon as you assertain please forward me  word. You will see in all my addresses and teaching that we published in the Star that I have thoroughly urged the necessity of all the Saints in this kingdom strictly abiding by the Laws of the land which agrees  with your council. As to News in this country I will say as a general thing we are prospering inevry part  of the vineyard before what we could expect considering the Extent of the field and the few Experienced Elders that  are in it there are still some few Conferences yet  that are some out of order and behind the time but in  all such cases it is for the want of a change of  officers to preside over the conferences but we have  no time for a Elders on hand to make the change with  four out of Eleven thousand Saints Scattered over such  a vast field we have ownly about six American Elders  to supply the whole with except 2 or 3 of us in Liverpool  and nearly all that are here else expecting soon to  leave for America to be in Nauvoo in the Spring and if we can hold our own untill we get 50  or 100 good wise Judicious men next spring after the  Endowment to our help we shall do well. O how I should  rejoice to think back with a company of such men  on these shores. For I am now in one servis alone though surrounded by many. The Lord has been with ENDENTRY Ah! she, thrice happy Babe,—By hands Divine,  Was raised to bloom in a more healthful clime, Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, p nor pain, But peace and joy uninterupted reign: Remote from ill, secure from earthly woe, Where chilling blasts are never known to blow.  Yes Sarah Lovely Babe! Her infant frame No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain. She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies, Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall rise To shine in bliss most exquisitly bright, Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.  And is she dead? O no! She enter'd life  The moment she escaped this world of strife: For here by tedious flight tehe mind aspires, And though, the senses all its skill acquires; And waits imprisoned 'till by slow degrees, The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees, O feels (by meanes of sense) the things around, O harks, delightd delight'd, to the pleasing sound, But now from earth removed; her soul expands,  And by the throne in holy rapture stands; Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames, And basks delighted, in unsully'd beames; Now hears with wonder the melodious strain, And joins to celebrate Messiahss name; Her mind illumin'd now with glad surprise, Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes, ENDENTRY being complete I suppose from the counting of them that  it was intended for 400 copies of each Vol but they very may materially as they now stand the following is a true  account of them as they come into my hands  sideways text     Vol 4th  Vol 5th      1- 356 1- 393   2- 361 2- 383   3- 362 3- 400   4- 361 4- 391   5- 366 5- 289   6- 362 6- 413   7- 351 7- 390   8- 362 8- 392   9- 362 9- 385—   10- 356=9 10- 388   11- 353=7 11- 389   12- 362 12- 382   13- 360 13- 368   14- 308 14- 381   15- 374 15- 399   16- 362 16- 390   17- 362 17- 382   18- 367 18- 394   19- 368     20- 366     21- 367     22- 374     23- 368     24- 366      end of sideways text  Thus you see the lowest Number of the 4th Vol is 308 while 15 and 22 are as high as 374. Also Vol 5th No 5 as low as 289 while No 6 as high as 413. Many of the 5th Vol were  just as they were when they came from Nauvoo not opened at all  and still they served in their Numbers as much as any other. Their has bean som bad managemet some whare in  counting them out but the list I have given you is Just  as they now stand I had two hard days work counting them  over and I found in Vol 4th No's 11= and 10 7 numbers of the first part of No 11 and the last part of No 10 was put together which spoiled  7 numbers of both 10 and 11. Before I left the office the Times  and Seasons were all counted out and we found a good many spare Numbers more than would make full  volumes if you could send me 43 extra Numbers of the  14th No of the 4th Vol it would make 43 full volumes more  than what we now have here and whare you see any of  these Numbers deficient on this list and you have any of the same ENDENTRY time to time. I pubished some Extracts in the last Star from your letters But fleft out any items that I did not wish to pubished to the world yet they were good news to me. please send us some good wisle faithful Americans when they get their Endowment that will act in consont with me in this land and I shall rejoice therein Broth pYoung please answer me the following question in some of your communications to me  When a person is cut off the second time for Adultery is their any way whareby He can be restored to the Church? the Doctrins and Covenants conveys an idea that they cannot but if their is any exceptions to that rule please informe me of it. my councils has been asked in one or two cases of this kind in this country but I do not give any council to the Saints that comes in  contact with the face of the covenants and my concil has been not to recieve such into the church. I received a letter from Elder Dan Jones yesterday saying that for the last month he had Been meeting from one End of the principality to the ENDENTRY and in fact many judgments are begining to be poured out upon the world. I am Enjoying a tolerable degree of health as is my wife and children my little Joseph is a fine child and doing well All the American Elders are well as far as  I know. We hear good News from the City of Joseph all the while for which I feel thankful I suppose you have interesting times continually with you. as to myself I can say of a truth  in no stage of the Chuch or of my labours have my cares been as great as since I have been heree in fact some of them are of such a nature that it makes me grow old and poor But with the Blessings of God I think I shall weather it all and live to again see my my Native country.  give my love to Sister Father and all who inquire after me, Also Mrs Woodruff writes to be remembered to all  As Ever I reman Your Friend and Brother  W.

All the Conferences are Replying many whare American Elders are labouring Manchster is doing exceding well under Elder Preston has ^Ben^ Baptized 45 the last 3 months under Elder Hardy and nearly all the Branches throughout the kingdom are on the increase, some few Rigdonite missionaries have visited this land but for some reason or other their stay has been exceding short, and they are now trying to get back to America it does not take root in this land they know nothing about the Stranger the judgments of God are ENDENTRY in your early youth, kneel down before you go to bed and pray for  your Father and Mother, and Sisters and Brother that we may all live to come home to see our Dear Wilford do not forget your Pa and Ma if we live we will come and see you again some timee write  us a few lines in Uncle and aunt Benbow's letter and you will much oblige your Dear Fathr and Mother  Wilford Woodruff Phebe W.

We are all well at present our youngest son is two months old the largest and healthiest child we ever had of his age. All is going on as well as can  be expected is this country considering all things the few wise labourers andc. Elder Jones I think is doing well in  Wales he has laboured faithfully, sown much seed that  is now taking root and begining to bring forth much fruit, within a few days past they have Baptized two Campbellite Evangelist or ministers and they are ordained priest I ordained one of them and a prospect of ther doing much good Br Jones has preached vary extensively in the largest cities and towns though that Welch domain and said their was nearly a hundred added tho the Branches in that land a few weeks before he  left, ^to pay me a visit^ I have held on to what few Americans their is in this land according to your request exept  Elders Georgetown Mass they had settled their affairs and about ready to sail when your letter arived and Elder Hardys family is  in such a cituation He is obliged to go home  so I did not stop them but I think we can ENDENTRY me on this mission thus far, and have been enabled to perfect much of a union in many conferences and  Branches and at the present time they are Baptising through most of the confrences. One Rigdonite Missionary  has made his arival and we understand others are following I have not yet been able to get the name of the  one that has come, he has been careful to keep away  from me, his stay in Liverpool was of vary short duration for though he tried hard but he said he could do no good  He went to Manchester Conference and he met with equal poor success he has now gone to Ireland and if those  that follow him do not have better success they will  not get pay for their trouble for the Saints in  this land have nothing to do with Sidney Rigdon or his followers for they are strangers. We are pretty well  prepared for any Rigdonites that may visit this country the bars we will put up. While I was in London Elder  Ward to put his address before  the High priest quorum and send him the prophets for he was  poor, so I found his pamphlet in print on my return to  Liverpool 1500 copies, so thes pamphlets will be circulated abroad among the chuches which will help block up Rigdonism. we were Blessed with a fine son aon the 18th of Aug July  I Blessed him on the 8th day and call him Joseph myself and  family are all well.

Sigh not surviveing friends - let sorrow cease— She now inherits everlasting peace. Tho' now you grieve, your grief shall turn to joy, And loftiest praise shall all your powers employ: For when - with you all earthly things are over, Beyond old Jordans flood, on Cannan's shore, Your lovely Babe, with rapture filled shall stand,  And shout you welcome to the promised land! ENDENTRY it would be be well to take good care of them  and not dispose of them as they will make full volumes with what we have here. I have been looking for Elder  Fielding for a long for a long time and expected the  remainder of the 5th Vol commencing with the 19th No as we have the 18th here. I have not thought proper to break the 5th vol or sell a part of it untill the whole  arived, but I think I have said quite sufficient upon  this subject. I have no doubt but that you are  quite busy but still I hope you will steal time  enough to duly consider this subject and give me an  answer. As to news in this county I will merely  touch upon a few items. the 18 of July brought us a fine Son. I blessed him on the 8th day, his name is Joseph. Father Son and Daughters all well. The Acader Brought us  Times and Seasons May 1st Neighbor July 2nd, 1st No of the  N. York Messenger letters from Philadelphia, and Connecticut and brought grand news I hope you will  continue to forward me the Times and Neighbor and when you  cannot find any thing els to do write a letter, all the American  Elders Here ^are^ well but what few we have got here are expecting  most of them to go home soon. The work is prosprous throughout  this country are generally well united and in the increase The  Liverpool Branch is in better order than it has been for years Elder McGuffee that has been apostizing for more than a  year and we cut him off. But he has since been ^in^ hell and is now  broke down is as humble as a child has made a most humble confession and is now coming into the church again. One Rigdon Missionary has arived and more we understand are comeing but unless  those that follow have better success than the one that is now  in England that will not get pay for their trouble.
