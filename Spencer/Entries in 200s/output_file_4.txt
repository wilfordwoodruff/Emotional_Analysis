 The names of virtues with their precepts were      1st Temperance—Eat not to dulness; drink not to elevation      2nd Silence—Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself  avoid trifling conversation      3rd Order—Let all your things have their places. let each part  of your business have its time      4th Resolution—Resolve to perform what you ought perform  without fail what you resolve      5 Frugality—Make no expens but to do good to others or yourself  that is waste nothing      6th Industry—Lose no time be always employed in somthing useful  cut off all unnecessary action      7th Sincerity—Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly  And if you speak speak accordingly      8th Justice—wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits  that are your duty      9th Moderation—Avoid extremes forbear resenting injuries so much  as you think they deserve      10 Cleanliness—Tolerate no uncleanliness in boby, clothes or  habitation      11th Tranquility—Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents  common or unavoidable      12 Chastity . . . . .      13 Humility—Imitate Jesus and Socrates      Says Franklin: My intention being to acquire the habit  of all these virtues I judged it would be well not to distract  my attention by attempting the whole at once but to fit  it on one of them at a time & when I should be master of  that, then to procede to another, & so on till I should have  gone through the 13. And as the previous acquisition of some  might facilitate the acquisition of certain others I aranged  them with this view as they stand above. Temperance first  as it tends to procure that cooleness & clearness of head   which is so necessary whare constant vigilance was to be up  and a guard maintained against the unremiting attraction  of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.      This being acquired and esstablished. Silence would be more  easy and my desire begiing to gain knowledge at the same time  that I improved in virtue & considering that in conver-  sation it was obtained rather by the use of the ear than of  the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was  getting unto of prattling, punning, and jesting which ownly  made me acceptable to trifling company. I gave silence the  second place this and the next order I expected would  allow me more time for attending to my project and my   studies. Resolution once become habitual would keep me  firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues  Frugality and industry releiving me from my remaining debt  and producing affluence and independance would make more     
 easy the practice of sincerity & Justice &c &c      conceiving then that agreeable to the advice of   Pythagoras in the golden verses daily examination   would be nessary, I contrived the following method for  conducting that examination. I made a little Book  in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues I   ruled each page with red ink so as to have seven columns  One for each day of the week, marking each column  with a letter for the day I crossed these columns with  13 red lines marking the begining of each line with the  first letter of one of the virtues on which line on which   line and in its proper column I might mark by a little  black spot every fault I found upon examination to have  been committed respecting that virtue upon that day      Form of the Pages      TEMPERANCE  Eat not to dulness, drink not to elevation      Sun M. T W Th F S      Tem  Sil ****  Ord *****  Res **  Fru **  Ind *  Sinc  Jus  Mod  Clea  Tran  Chas  Hum      I determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the  virtues successively. thus in the first week I could my  great guard was to avoid even the least offence against  temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance  ownly marking evry evening the faults of the day.     
 Thus ^if^ in the first ^week^ I could keep my first line marked T  clear of spots I supposed the habit of that virtue so  much strengthend and its opposite weakened that I  might venture extending my attention to include the  next and for the following week keep both lines  clear of spots proceding thus to the last I could get  through a course complete in 13 weeks and four courses  in a year. And like him who having a garden to weed  does not attempt to eradicate all the bad barbs at once  which wood exced his reach and his strength but  works on one of the beds at a time and having acco-  mplished the first proceds to a second so I should  have I hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on  my pages the progress made in virtue by clearing success-  fully my lines of their spots till in the end by a num-  ber of courses I should be happy in viewing a clean  Book after a thirteen weeks daily examination      This my little Book had for its motto these lines from Addisons Cato      Here will I hold if there's a power above us  And that there is all nature cries aloud  Through all her works He must delight in virtue  And that which he delights in must be happy      Thus I have copied so much out of the life of Franklin think-  ing it an excellent & worthy example, and hoping it may  do me or my children or some other persons some good.  Another principle of Dr Franklins life & recommendation  is vary good under many circumstances in life He recom  mends to all persons in the pulpit, at the bar, in debate,  in conversation to take the modarate ground in Phrase-  ology to say I think or apprehend, I believe or I am  of the opinion that things are thus & so. And not that I  know, I declare, I affirm, that things are thus and so      February 7, 1854  ~ Tuesday      7th I spent the day at home with my children      February 8, 1854 ~ Wednesday to February 11, 1854  ~ Saturday      8 9 10 & 11 I spent the time in school with my children  I attended meeting in the 14 ward with the children  on the 8th & had a good time we are now holding meet-  ings in the different wards through the city with  [FIGURE] the children we get all the children over  8 yards years of age together & learn them to pray  & speak of the things of God and it is having a  good influence their is a great responsibility resting  upon the parents towards their children      February 12, 1854 ~ Sunday      12 Sunday John Taylor addressed the saints in the  forenoon And President Young in the afternoon He delivered  one of the most interesting discourses ever delivered to the people  I did not report eit but others did and it will be printed      February 13, 1854 ~ Monday to February 14, 1854 ~ Tuesday      13th 14th I spent the time with my children in school

E T Benson  followed & made a spirited speech followed By F. D. Richards  A Lyman A song from E. Snow, W. Woodruff followed  Orson Hyde who Blessed Jane & the Twelve W. Woodruff  said, I feel like saying a few words to Jane Blackhurst  In the History of the whole world I do not know of a woman  occupying the position of Sister Jane. A woman once fed  one Prophet Elisha in time of Famine & the prophet increased the  cruse of Oil & a measure of meal through the famine [##2 Kings 4:1-7##] & one or  two women was last at the cross [##John 19:25##] & Earliest at the grave of   Jesus. [##Mark 16:1-9##] But Jane Blackhurst has made a feast for the Presid-  ency & Twelve, some fifteen Apostles & Prophets annually  for the last fifteen years although she is a poor crippled  woman, therefore I will say unto Sister Jane in the name  of Jesus Christ as an Appostle that all the Blessings which     
 Dec 28  which have been promised you by the Apostles shall be fulfilled  upon your head & when you get through with the toils of this life  you shall come forth in the Morning of the first resurrection  clothed with glory immortality & Eternal Life, & you shall have  the privilege of associating in the Celestial kingdom of God with  these vary Apostles & Prophets whom you have been feasting  Annually for the last fifteen years (Brother & Sister Blackhurst  came over the sea with the Twelve in the ship Rochester in 1841)  I will also say to the Twelve concerning the Kingdom of God whom  you are called to build up, that when the Lord sent the Angel to visit  Joseph Smith to deliver unto him the Book of Mormon. The devil  done all in his power to destroy the work in the butd & stop the organ-  ization of the church upon the Earth this was before there was any  church or kingdom of God or Prophet or Appostle upon the Earth  yet the Lord watched vover the work & frustrated the power of the  devil & has contained to do it untill to day in spite of Earth  & Hell, will not the Lord continue to watch over his church  kingdom &work & people untill the End. will he not hear & answer  the prayers of the Prophets, Appostles, & Saints, whose Prayers  are asscending into the Ears of the Lord of Saboath daily. yes  he assuredly will. He will sustain Zion & his Kingdom upon  the Earth untill the Law shall go forth of Zion & the world of the  Lord from Jerrusalem & he will destroy his Enemies &   those that fight against Mount Zion. The God of Israel  suffered Joseph Smith the Prophet to be martered & his brother  Hiram that they might be crowned in the presence of God  & the Nation was worthy to shed Innocent Blood, who slew  them & they will be destroyed & cast down to Hell. Ye  Apostles of the Lamb still remain upon the Earth to build  upon the foundation which the prophet Joseph has laid  you have labored & toiled many years to build up Zion & to  bring souls into the kingdom of God. You have been Blessed  & shall be unto the End & you shall overcome your Enemies  I care not what Congress or the Nation attempts to  do against us God will overthrow them & hege up their  way other remarks were made by the speakers     
 Dec 22nd 1865  Elder Taylor followed & backed up the Testimony of those  who had spoke He was followed by Elder Cannon, all the  Twelve present spoke & much of the spirit of God rested  upon us & we were Blessed & felt it good to be there  Elder Taylor Prophesyed that the Twelve should be delivered  from the bondage of the poverty under which they had  been weltering for years.

 Dec 11, 1869      Man of a Higher Priesthood then He would her But Even  A man Holding the office of a deacon may magnify that   calling so that he would be more worthy & have a higher  Exaltation than many High Priest it is not so much the office  a Man Holds as it is of the magnifying of that portion of the   office He does hold. Some ordinances cannot Be given without  A temple All children Born Before Parents are sealed to the   Altar will have to be sealed to their Parents in order to make them   Legal heirs those who are Born after the parents are sealed are legal  heirs. Man also will have to be sealed to Man untill the chain is united  from Father Adam down to the last saint this will be the work of the  Millennium & Joseph Smith will be the Man to attend to it or to dictate  it He will not administer in person But He will receive his resurrected  Body & will dictate to those who dwell in the flesh & tell what   is to be done for He is the Last Prophet who is called to lay the   foundation of the great Last dispensation of the fullness of times   some have thought it strange what I have said concerning Adam  But the period will come when this people of faithful will be willing  to adopt Joseph Smith as their prophet seer Revelator & God But not  the father of their spirits for that was our Father Adam Many  questions are asked about divorces I will say that many men  & women want to be sealed that should not be for they will not stay  together. But if I was to stop it there would be a fulss now what is  to be done they will be sealed & then they will separate some   give them Bills of divorce I charge Nothing for sealing But   I charge $10 for Bills of divorce if they will Break the comma-  ndments & make me Break them they shall Pay $10 for [it] President  Joseph Young asked President Young if He was Justified in giving  these Bills of Divorce President Young says yes I am I do not force  them to separate I give them good council & tell them what to do  No man has a right to put away a wife Except for adultry But  when a woman will leave a man against his will He does not  not put her away; but she puts herself away & he that Marries  her commits adultery as Jesus says. I am Justified in giving   these Bills of Divorce for they will separate against my council  & the woman othertakes the responsibility upon herself & not me

Rich in the Afternoon 30 Minutes &  President Young spoke one hour much to the Edification  of the saints. I met with the Presidency & Twelve for Prayer  I Preached in the 19 ward in the Evening & laid Hands upon  Samuel Kimball son of Heber C Kimball He had been  kicked By a mule & his skul broke in & a peace of his skol  taken out & He appears to be getting better although it is a Miricle      December 27, 1869 ~ Monday to December 30, 1869 ~ Thursday      27, 28, 29 & 30. I spent the time laboring with my Hands      December 31, 1869 ~ Friday      31. The last day of the year I spent at home A synopsis of   My labors will be found on the following leaf. Thus Ends 1869   and it has Been a vary important year in many respects  The great National Highway, the Union Pacific, & Central   Pacific was built during this year also the Utah Central   Rail Road was Built from Ogden to Salt Lake City The first   Rail Road Built By the Latter Day Saints & owned By Them, And   the first Rail Road Built in America. Built By working men   without Assistance from Government, or large capitalist, this   is Built By the Poor Saints & owned By them without assistance from   any one Expcept the Lord. This opens a communication wi   Between Salt Lake City & all the world. We Emigrated about  3000 Saints during this year. We have Lost during the past  year One of our Number of the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles Viz Ezra Taft Benson & Albert Carrington was   Appointed in his stead. President Brigham Young G A. Smith   D. H. Wells & the Twelve Apostles have travelled from St Charles     
 Bear lake valley to St George in Washington County &  President Brigham Young Preached during these Journies 43 Hours  & 12 minutes according to the time I kept as recorded in my   Journal. We also Esstablished the Joint Merchantile Coop-  eration as a general whole sale store also ward stores.   we have had sent unto us By the general Government the   most wicked set of Judges & all government officers that  have Ever Been sent in Utah Territory, they are doing  all they can to stir up the general Government to make war   war upon us & to destroy us from off the Earth. We have  had some Aposticy from the Church. L. E. Harrison  Wm S. Godby Henry W Lawrence Eli B. Kelsey & some   others have Been cut off from the Church for Aposticy &   they have formed themselve into a New Church the  same as other Apostates Have at different times and   they have Become Spiritualist & pretend to receive Rev-  ilations. Wickedness is increasing throughout this   whole Nation & Exhertions are making to try to destroy   the kingdom of God. The Nations of the Earth are becoming   more & more fearful of the signs of the times & of the future   Events which await them. We have had peace in these   vallies since we came here as pioneers in 1847 with the  Exception of the Buchannan war which cost the Nation   $40,000000 dollars & cost us 40 miles travel & Back again  we have also had some Indians wars which has cost   some lives & considerable property. The wicked of this  Nation are determined if possible to destroy & scatter   the saints during the year 1870 But the Saints are in the   Hands of God as they Ever have Been, & God will   defend them & fight their Battles if they will ownly be  faithful & trust in him. 1870 will be an Eventful  year in many respects. In fact Every year is Eventful   now in this fast age God has set his hand to Esstablish  Zion & his Kingdom & he will accomplish in spite of   Earth & Hell, wicked men & devils He will overthrow   the wicked the, scorners, the Hipocritt, & unbelievers & save his Saints

A Bill is Before Congress to deprive the Latter   Day Saints, of keeping the commandments of God the Lord  has revealed the Law on the Patriarchal order of Marriage &  the Lord says we shall be damned if we do not obey it &  Congress says we shall be damned if we do so it its the Lord  & Congress for it I would rather obey the Lord than Congress      January 7, 1870 ~ Friday      7.

 June 12, 1870      They are visited by the whites who profess to know more than   the Lamanites do yet they introduce all the sins & corruptions of the  age to them & degrade them more than they naturally are yet we  acknowledge them Human beings & think them wicked when  they kill any one, or steal, yet the soldiers & whites will kill  them with impunity & they be Extoled for it & that is wrong  Now our Boys will trade with them swap horses, run races, &   wrestle with them, we should not descend so low as to do such   things. the Christians do it but we should not. An English  Lord came to me he did not look as though he knew Enough to gam-  ble but he went to Calafornia & met with their gamblers & took  their Money but we should not gamble nor do any such thing, a  gentleman os one that Behaves well at all times.

Elders many times are vain & trifling & seem to forget their  calling & their position on the Earth But we should realize  we have the Priesthood & are set as an example to all men  and we should magnify our callings & walk with dignity  before the Lord.

 June 22nd 1870 ~ Wednesday      B Young Jr Prayed President Young spoke 38 M[inutes] He said If I   was to ask how many there are here today who was in Jackson   Co I think there would be but few, or in Kirtland or far west   but few I contrast the groth of this people with these days  In the days of Joseph it was a hard Matter to get the people   to believe in Revelation. But I told the people the day would come   when the world would be flooded with Revelation, but from  the devil. This began by a woman being put to sleep & gave  Revelation. Spiritualism began in this way all their Revel-  ations go to deny Jesus Christ, the gospel & the Atonement  There are a few thousands who do know that God lives I   with this people know it & are witnesses of it, & there never  was a people as much blessed as this people on Earth  We have the privilege of Attending to the ordinances of the House of  God for the dead, did the Zion of Enoch Or Adam, Abram   Isaac, or Jacob, or the Twelve Apostles in the days of Christ  No they did not. But we are the people that are called  to do this work. What other people have been called to do this   work I do not know of any, if this is our work what state   of Mind are we in, are we after the world & the things of the  world this should not be. those who have turned away from   their callings & seek for the things of the world will turn  away from the Church & Apostitize. The world are com-  bined against & seek our destruction. they do not see the   things of God, but we do, this is the difference between them and   us. We know the things of God, but they do not, it is our duty   to gather the poor & build up Zion, while they seek to destroy   us. God will save all the Inhabitants of the Earth in some kingdom  except the Sons of perdition. We are called to do that that  No other people were Ever called to do. We are called to   keep the Celestial Law of God upon Mount Zion All   the Merchants who have got riches among us I cannot controll   them, & if they do not repent they will be damned & go  to Hell. Can you not see your position that you are called  to Redeem the dead. In the days of Joseph He felt vary   Bad to see a Man Apostitize But now I feel if a man     
 June 22nd 1870      wants to Apostitize I say let him go. Cut the thread  & the least we say about the Apostates or the officers of Government   the Better, & Mr Grant has been on a bed of Nettles  to know what the Mormons were agoing to do if they   Passed the Collum Bill. I have told them I did not  know but God will tell us what to do & if we do it He  will protect us in all things. We have No time to spare  Not a Moment do all in our power to save ourselves  & redeem our dead. you may think things are going   slow but we are doing all we can. Now be kind to   your families dont scold at them But pray in your  families & do your duty to them. D H Wells spok 51 M[inutes]  W Woodruff spoke 17 Minutes & said we did not realize our   Privileges, if none of the Ancients Redeemed the dead we still   have a greater work to do. I would not like to go into the   spirit world & meet my friends who have died without the  gospel & have them reproach me for not doing my duty towards  them it is a great reponsibility to be a Prophet, Apostle or   Elder. the saints should take the council given them, the  Ancients are not Perfect without us nor we without them  then let us labor diligently to fulfill our mission & do our   duty & not sell our Birthright or make ship wreck of faith.  John Taylor ^afternoon^ spoke 63 Minutes read the 38 chapter of Job & spoke   upon it. spoke of the afflictions Job received at the hand of   the Devil. xx F D Richards spoke 36 Minutes.   I attended a party in the Evening we laid hands upon Elder   Preston President Young Blessed him      June 23, 1870 ~ Thursday      23 We Met at 10 oclok A M. Musser Prayed L. Snow   spoke 45 Minutes He spoke of the Exhaltation of the Saints, the  Lord does not intend for the Saints to always live in dens &  caves of the Earth but to build good fine Houses & Mansions  when the Lord comes He will not Expect to Meet a Dirty lazy   People But expects to Meet the Zion of God with Refinement   & Glory as the Bride the Lambs wife already this zion is  attracting the Attention of the world we should continue to  improve when we were called to go South I continued to     
 June 23rd 1870      improve untill the last Moment Expecting to burn Every thing up  Except what we took south with us & I wanted to burn as much  as I could, but when we returned from Provo I Believed we   were on our return to Jackson Co, & I shall still believe it untill  I learn to the contrary. Those who follow Brigham Young will be   much richer than those who do not we should feel that all we   have is on the Altar to build up the Kingdom of God with.  there is Nothing more glorious than to see an old man who  has grown Gray in the service of God, & in building up his work  as we grow older we should grow better & more kind to our fam-  ily. President Young says Politeness is in the heart & not in Bowing  & scraping. When Moses came out the people came out to see   him & did not come out with Banners & flags flying to greet  him as they do President Young. When we were called to go   South we united as the Heart of one Man & were ready to   Burn up Evry thing we had, the Lord tryed us in this  But when He found we would do as we were told he with-  held our hand from burning up our property & restored it  to us again in this I acknowlede the Hand of God in all things  I was drowned in the Pacific & it cured me of a Head   ake I had from my childhood. B Young jr spoke 32 M[inutes]  spoke of the improvements since we came here Said there was 47   families in St Thomas, & 43 Babies, & one death last year.  The U. S. Government sent an Army to drive us out of these M  Mountains & in three years they had a war that cost a   Million of lives & $4,00000000000 dollars & the Army   who came here turned traitors to the Government & did fight  against the North. some people are anxious to keep cattle   to go back to Jackson Co Mo with we shall not go  with ox teams but By Rail Road. R T Burton spoke   23 Minutes. In continually feasting there is danger of   Eating to Much, But no danger of Getting to much spiritual   food. In Nauvoo the Temple was built with gun ^trowel^ in one hand   & the sword in the other & what Peace we have here is in   consequence of our being ready to defend ourselves the first  council given was to build forts in Evry settlement the     
 June 23rd 1870      the Neglect of this has cost this Territy Millions of   Dollars & many lives. Can we ask God to defend our   families, while we Neglect the council given us.  we should keep the word of wisdom & keep our arms   & amunition in good order we should set a good  Example in Zion & not be seen chewing tobaco & with a  pipe in our Mouth or drinking whiskey.

Those who say they cannot  keep the word of wisdom it shows they cannot, those  who say they can such can keep the word of wisdom  The word of wisdom if carried out would add   to the lives of the rising generation 20 to 30 years how glorious  it would be to talk with an intelligent Man 100 years old  I say to my family & to my sisters if they would give  up their tea & coffee, they would be much better off I  want to say to the people Now go to & save all of your  wheat that you can & lay it up & dont sell it. I dont  think the Month of March has found me with less than  7 years of Bread on hand but I have had to let it go to men   who have let there wheat go for a song. When the people came   to these Mountains many had not Bread Enough to last  a week. But would say Brother Young will not let us starve  it is time you laid up your grain I know as God lives  that if we had done right, laid up our grain as we have  been councilled, we should not have been visited by the  grass hoppers. Our Brethren sent their flour to Mon-  tania for Nothing & I tryed to guide it, & I fear if the  people do not do Better there is a worse scourge to come  & Now sisters I want you to take hold & raise a   fiactiongry & you will soon Accomplish it if you will say the

"What have the people come  together for, for the worship of God, who are you worshiping  do you know his character, if you worship the Lord  with lip service without the Heart your lip service will be   in vain. In the days of Christ why did not the people  believe in him, his doctrin was good and still is but   the people did not Believe on him the reason is the people   walk in the dark & not in the light & are at Enmity against  God. The Devil rules over the people, but few have the spirit   of God to Believe his doctrin & follow him. But few do  so in this day but few are in the light of Christ today   to receive the Gospel. the light of Christ shines upon all  Men or strives with them in a measure, to lead them to God  But the Devil influences them to that degree that they

All men are  not capaciated alike to receive the light & truth from   God or to receive the same Exhaltation all will be rew-  arded according to his deeds. The honorable Men of the  world will not reject the light of God but the wicked  will reject it & fight against God & destroy his people   if they can and they sin unto death and will not   have foregiveness we are here the Saints of God with  the kingdom of God will you receive it or reject it, let   the spirit of God dwell in your hearts.

 November 27, 1871 ~ Monday      Nov 27, 1871      [FIGURES] This was quite an important day day with me I arose in the morn-  ing & found the snow 3 feet deep on the level & still snowing furiously  & I could see no way to find deliverance for myself & team unless the   Lord opened the way. Evry thing was glomy I had to wallow to my arms  pits in snow to go to my horses or any whare Els. Mr Haven had sent  to Evanston for a car for me the night before by my request but  how to get my waggon & team on to it was the great question I  talked with Mr Haven in the Morning concerning the prospect of Getting  on board of a car. He did not see how it could be done. My waggon   was covered with snow, & some 300 yards from the Depo & No help to  get it there except the Chimamen in the Hands of Carpenter who  was Employed to keep the rail road track clear of snow. I talked  with Carpenter & he said he had no right to take his men from   the rail Road to dig a span of Horses & waggon out of the snow to  get them on board of the cars it was under these circumstances that  I wallowed through 3 feet of snow some 300 yards to My Horses in  the storehouse I went to them rubed them down carressed them  but could not feed them except as it were a morsel I knelt down  & prayed Earnestly to the Lord to Deliver me & my team, it might  be thought a small matter to leave a team to starve to Death & take  the cars & save my own life but my team had saved mine, had wallowed  through the snow some 12 miles to save mine & I felt it my duty to do  all in my power to save theirs. I prayed Earnestly to the Lord to   Deliver me & save my Animals from starvation. The spirit of the  Lord came upon me while Praying & I had a testimony while  praying that my Prayers would be answered & that I should be delivered  I arose from my knees & wallowed some 60 rods through 3 feet of  snow to the Telegraph office & talked with Mr Haven the operator  & Agent at wasatch. I told him he must Help Me. The spirit of  the Lord rested upon him & he said he would do all in his   power for my deliverance & we went together to see Mr Carpenter  the same spirit same upon him & he said he would do all He  could he had ten Chinamen with him he told them to take  their shovels & follow him we all went to whare the Horses & waggon   was & it took us some 5 Hours to dig out the waggon & open a road some  400 yards to the Depo & to get our Horses & waggon there we then had to     
 Nov 27, 1871      build a stageing some 10 feet high out of plank to get the Horses up  & covered it with coal sinders when I brought the Horses to it they would  not go up. I them went [t]o Mr Hammer an Apostate Mormon & bitter  at that who had the ownly hay in the place & asked him to sell me 50 cts  worth of Hay. He caught the same spirits of the others went & put up the  hay & carried it for me to the Depo I laid it on the platform at   the Head of the stageing & both of My Horses readily went to it I led  them inside we then went to work & had to take the waggon all to  peaces & lift it up a wheel to [at a] time some 8 feet perpendicular to get it in-  to the store house. when the freight train came along Mr Haven stoped   it & had the Engineer take his Engine & bring up the car 100 yards to the  platform for me to load my Horses & waggon in. I got my Horses in without  difficulty but in trying to get my Box in with the Bows & cover on we got  stuck fast with one End on the platform & the other against the side of the car the  Engineer would not wait any longer but started on with his train &  left me Mr Haven telegraphed to Evanston to send him another Engine  we went to work took the cover & Bows of the waggon Box & got it loaded  & when I got all my things on board & got on board with my  Horses & waggon & myself an Engine came Down from Evanston  & Mr Haven ordered the Engineer to hitch on to that car &  take it to Ogden & he done so but did not like it much as He  had to travel something like 160 miles to go to Ogden & back just to take  me down when the car started I bid my Friends good by &   knelt down by the side of My Horses & felt to return harty thanks  to God my Heavenly Father for the Deliverance he had wrought out  for me I had wallowed in the snow all day untill I was wet to my   armpits I changed my clothing in the car & rode in the car 65 M[iles]  to Ogden without a fire I arived in Ogden abot 10 oclok I went   to Bishop Herricks & spent the night      November 28, 1871 ~ Tuesday      28 I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep Bishop Herrick loand  me $25 to pay my Bill at the Rail Road & received his pay again  in Salt Lake City the same day.

Pratt spoke first & refered to the time he first  [FIGURES] saw Joseph Smith in the same house whare the first Branch of the  Church was organized said he wished that there could be a small  plain history of Joseph Smith written by some one who had a good  Memory by some one who could remember the circumstances as they  were. said he received a testimony there that he knew the work was of  God it was not by the Administration of Angels or open vision but  by the Holy Ghost He made other remarks. He was followed By W. Woodruff  I said there was one subject I wished to speak upon & that was writing   & keeping a Journal of the dealings of God with us I have many times   thought the Quorum of the Twelve & others considered me rather enthu-  siastic upon this subject But when the Prophet Joseph organized the  Quorum of the Twelve he Commanded them to write & keep a Journal  or History of their lives & gave his reasons why they should do it I think  the Twelve Apostles & all the Elders of Israel who bear the Holy Priesthood  should keep a Journal of their official acts & the dealings of God with them  I would be glad to read the Acts of My forefathers if they had never   herd of a God. But esspecially when men are called to stand at the  head of a Great dispensation like this & to build up the kingdom of God on   the Earth to remain forever, they of all men on Earth ought to write   & keep a true & correct History of the rise & progress of that Kingdom,  of the Revelations of Jesus Christ & his dealings with us as we travel     
 Jan 20, 1872      along in our pilgrimage. I have had this spirit upon me since I first   Entered this Chirch I was Baptized the first sermon I herd & from   that day untill now I have kept a daily Journal whenever I have herd  Joseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I have always felt it my duty   to write it. I have always felt uneasy I could not Eat drink or sleep  in peace untill I did write it & my mind has been so Exercised upon  this subjects that when I herd Joseph Smith teach & I had not pen-  cil & paper I would go home & set down & write that whole sermon  almost word for word & sentence By sentence as it was deliver & when  I had written it, it was taken from me I remembered it no more  this was the gift of God to me & the question has often rested me why are  these things so, why has this subject rested upon me more than other men  again another Question has rested upon my mind many times? why  has the devil sought to take my life from the day I was born untill   now more than other men, for I been a marked victim for the  devil from the day I was born untill now, and I can find but   one answer & that is the devil knew if I got into the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I would write the History of the  Church & leave on Record the doings, works, & teachings of the prophets  & Apostles Elders & Saints in the latter days, & that I would attend to  the Ordinances of the House of God. For my Fathers Household & Friends  both for the living & the dead. I am the ownly person in all the lineage  of my Fathers Household Either on my Father or Mothers side who  has been in the Church & in a situation to do any thing for my  Fathers House I Baptized my Father & all his household that He had   with him at the time including my step Mother & half sister  I am the ownly person that has attended to any of the ordinances   of the Church for my Dead. Again I have recorded nearly all  the sermons & teachings that I Ever herd Joseph Smith deliver & many   of the Quorum of the Twelve I have in my Journals scores of sermons   of President Brigham Young that He does not know that Exist on   Earth so of Orson Hyde, Parley Pratt, Orson Pratt, & others, one  reason I have Been moved upon to write in Early days was  nearly all the Historians appointed in the Early History of the Church  Apostitized & took the Journals away with them which in a measure   were lost to the Church. I still keep a daily Journal but I have not     
 Jan 20, 1872      reported sermons much for many years for we have had scribes   & reporters to keep a record of the sayings of the Prophets & Apostles &  I rejoice & thank God for it does my soul good to look upon these  little Boys sons of Brother George Q Cannon & others set at the reports   table & report the sermons as they are delivered from the mouth of   the Prophets & Apostles I would there were 10 whare their is but one  Another Subject I wish to say a few words upon & that is the spirit  of God to man, the Holy Ghost which is given to the saints, The   inspiration of the Almighty which giveth the spirit of man under-  standing it is the greatest testimony man can possess, his Eyes & Ears   may be deceived in seeing the miracles such as the magicians in the  days of Moses or such as the fals Prophets & beasts of the last day will   perform wbut when the Elect receive the Holy Ghost they will not be deceived [##Exodus 7:22##]  but man is apt to look to high or Expect too great things so that they  often times mistake the spirit of God & the inspiration of the Almighty  it is not in the Thunder or whirlwind that we should look for the spirit   of God but in the still small voice "The wind Bloweth whare it listeth  & ye hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether   it goeth so all is the spirit saith Jesus" [##John 3:8##] We should all become acquainted   with this spirit & obey its voice for it hath preserved the prophets Apostles  & Elders for the last 40 years in their travels upon the Earth. We have  all Experienced this from time to time our lives have been preserved  by listning to the whisperings of that still small voice. When I was going   to Boston in the spring of 1848 with my family I drove into the door  yard of one of the Brethren tied my Mules to a large oak tree & went   to Bed in my carriage with my carriage ^family^ the spirit came upon   me & told me to get up & move my ^carriage^ & my mules I did so & it was but   a short time untill a whirlwing took that oak tree broak it into nom   the ground & brought it some 12 rods & laid it prostrate in that dooryard   & the body of fall whare my carriage stood & if I had not moved it   I should have been killed with my family. Again when I was bri-  nging the Eastern Saints to this valley when I arived in Pitsburgh   I chartered a steemboat to take the saints to St Louis as soon as  I had done it the spirit said to me dont go abord of that Boat. the  Captain released me & I chartered another the steemer that   I first chartered started down the river soon took fire burned     
 Jan 20, 1872      the wheel cha ropes into & nearly all the passenger Either burned  to death or drowned many in this Church have Experienced these   things, & in all the travels & Emigrations of the saints for the last   40 years the preserving care of our Hevenly Father has been over   us & we as a people have been preserved while the wicked have  been destroyed upon Evry hand, the destruction of the saluda   is the ownly case whare the saints have met with disaster in their  Emigration, and if Eli B. Kelsey who was the leader of the company  had had the spirit of God & his office upon him he never would  have gone on board of that Boat or taken the saints on board of it  I would Exhort all the Saints to get the spirit of God & keep  it & live under its influence, & then they are always safe. And   "this is the condemnation of the world that light has come  into the world & men love darkness rather than light because their  deeds are Evil      Elder G. Q. Cannon followed in some remarks the spirit of God  rested upon us & we had a good meeting      January 21, 1872 ~ Sunday      21.
