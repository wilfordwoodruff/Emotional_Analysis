 The names of virtues with their precepts were1st Temperance—Eat not to dulness; drink not to elevation2nd Silence—Speak not but what may benefit others or yourselfavoid trifling conversation3rd Order—Let all your things have their places. let each partof your business have its time4th Resolution—Resolve to perform what you ought performwithout fail what you resolve5 Frugality—Make no expens but to do good to others or yourselfthat is waste nothing6th Industry—Lose no time be always employed in somthing usefulcut off all unnecessary action7th Sincerity—Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justlyAnd if you speak speak accordingly8th Justice—wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefitsthat are your duty9th Moderation—Avoid extremes forbear resenting injuries so muchas you think they deserve10 Cleanliness—Tolerate no uncleanliness in boby, clothes orhabitation11th Tranquility—Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidentscommon or unavoidable12 Chastity . . . . .13 Humility—Imitate Jesus and SocratesSays Franklin: My intention being to acquire the habitof all these virtues I judged it would be well not to distractmy attention by attempting the whole at once but to fitit on one of them at a time & when I should be master ofthat, then to procede to another, & so on till I should havegone through the 13. And as the previous acquisition of somemight facilitate the acquisition of certain others I arangedthem with this view as they stand above. Temperance firstas it tends to procure that cooleness & clearness of head which is so necessary whare constant vigilance was to be upand a guard maintained against the unremiting attractionof ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.This being acquired and esstablished. Silence would be moreeasy and my desire begiing to gain knowledge at the same timethat I improved in virtue & considering that in conver-sation it was obtained rather by the use of the ear than ofthe tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I wasgetting unto of prattling, punning, and jesting which ownlymade me acceptable to trifling company. I gave silence thesecond place this and the next order I expected wouldallow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution once become habitual would keep mefirm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtuesFrugality and industry releiving me from my remaining debtand producing affluence and independance would make more 
 easy the practice of sincerity & Justice &c &cconceiving then that agreeable to the advice of Pythagoras in the golden verses daily examination would be nessary, I contrived the following method forconducting that examination. I made a little Bookin which I allotted a page for each of the virtues I ruled each page with red ink so as to have seven columnsOne for each day of the week, marking each columnwith a letter for the day I crossed these columns with13 red lines marking the begining of each line with thefirst letter of one of the virtues on which line on which line and in its proper column I might mark by a littleblack spot every fault I found upon examination to havebeen committed respecting that virtue upon that dayForm of the PagesTEMPERANCEEat not to dulness, drink not to elevationSun M. T W Th F STemSil ****Ord *****Res **Fru **Ind *SincJusModCleaTranChasHumI determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of thevirtues successively. thus in the first week I could mygreat guard was to avoid even the least offence againsttemperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chanceownly marking evry evening the faults of the day. 
 Thus ^if^ in the first ^week^ I could keep my first line marked Tclear of spots I supposed the habit of that virtue somuch strengthend and its opposite weakened that Imight venture extending my attention to include thenext and for the following week keep both linesclear of spots proceding thus to the last I could getthrough a course complete in 13 weeks and four coursesin a year. And like him who having a garden to weeddoes not attempt to eradicate all the bad barbs at oncewhich wood exced his reach and his strength butworks on one of the beds at a time and having acco-mplished the first proceds to a second so I shouldhave I hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing onmy pages the progress made in virtue by clearing success-fully my lines of their spots till in the end by a num-ber of courses I should be happy in viewing a cleanBook after a thirteen weeks daily examinationThis my little Book had for its motto these lines from Addisons CatoHere will I hold if there's a power above usAnd that there is all nature cries aloudThrough all her works He must delight in virtueAnd that which he delights in must be happyThus I have copied so much out of the life of Franklin think-ing it an excellent & worthy example, and hoping it maydo me or my children or some other persons some good.Another principle of Dr Franklins life & recommendationis vary good under many circumstances in life He recommends to all persons in the pulpit, at the bar, in debate,in conversation to take the modarate ground in Phrase-ology to say I think or apprehend, I believe or I amof the opinion that things are thus & so.

A woman once fedone Prophet Elisha in time of Famine & the prophet increased thecruse of Oil & a measure of meal through the famine [##2 Kings 4:1-7##] & one ortwo women was last at the cross [##John 19:25##] & Earliest at the grave of Jesus. [##Mark 16:1-9##] But Jane Blackhurst has made a feast for the Presid-ency & Twelve, some fifteen Apostles & Prophets annuallyfor the last fifteen years although she is a poor crippledwoman, therefore I will say unto Sister Jane in the nameof Jesus Christ as an Appostle that all the Blessings which 
 Dec 28which have been promised you by the Apostles shall be fulfilledupon your head & when you get through with the toils of this lifeyou shall come forth in the Morning of the first resurrectionclothed with glory immortality & Eternal Life, & you shall havethe privilege of associating in the Celestial kingdom of God withthese vary Apostles & Prophets whom you have been feastingAnnually for the last fifteen years (Brother & Sister Blackhurstcame over the sea with the Twelve in the ship Rochester in 1841)I will also say to the Twelve concerning the Kingdom of God whomyou are called to build up, that when the Lord sent the Angel to visitJoseph Smith to deliver unto him the Book of Mormon. The devildone all in his power to destroy the work in the butd & stop the organ-ization of the church upon the Earth this was before there was anychurch or kingdom of God or Prophet or Appostle upon the Earthyet the Lord watched vover the work & frustrated the power of thedevil & has contained to do it untill to day in spite of Earth& Hell, will not the Lord continue to watch over his churchkingdom &work & people untill the End. will he not hear & answerthe prayers of the Prophets, Appostles, & Saints, whose Prayersare asscending into the Ears of the Lord of Saboath daily. yeshe assuredly will. He will sustain Zion & his Kingdom uponthe Earth untill the Law shall go forth of Zion & the world of theLord from Jerrusalem & he will destroy his Enemies & those that fight against Mount Zion. The God of Israelsuffered Joseph Smith the Prophet to be martered & his brotherHiram that they might be crowned in the presence of God& the Nation was worthy to shed Innocent Blood, who slewthem & they will be destroyed & cast down to Hell. YeApostles of the Lamb still remain upon the Earth to buildupon the foundation which the prophet Joseph has laidyou have labored & toiled many years to build up Zion & tobring souls into the kingdom of God. You have been Blessed& shall be unto the End & you shall overcome your EnemiesI care not what Congress or the Nation attempts todo against us God will overthrow them & hege up theirway other remarks were made by the speakers

Some ordinances cannot Be given withoutA temple All children Born Before Parents are sealed to the Altar will have to be sealed to their Parents in order to make them Legal heirs those who are Born after the parents are sealed are legalheirs. Man also will have to be sealed to Man untill the chain is unitedfrom Father Adam down to the last saint this will be the work of theMillennium & Joseph Smith will be the Man to attend to it or to dictateit He will not administer in person But He will receive his resurrectedBody & will dictate to those who dwell in the flesh & tell what is to be done for He is the Last Prophet who is called to lay the foundation of the great Last dispensation of the fullness of times some have thought it strange what I have said concerning AdamBut the period will come when this people of faithful will be willingto adopt Joseph Smith as their prophet seer Revelator & God But notthe father of their spirits for that was our Father Adam Manyquestions are asked about divorces I will say that many men& women want to be sealed that should not be for they will not staytogether.

I spent the time laboring with my HandsDecember 31, 1869 ~ Friday31. The last day of the year I spent at home A synopsis of My labors will be found on the following leaf. Thus Ends 1869 and it has Been a vary important year in many respectsThe great National Highway, the Union Pacific, & Central Pacific was built during this year also the Utah Central Rail Road was Built from Ogden to Salt Lake City The first Rail Road Built By the Latter Day Saints & owned By Them, And the first Rail Road Built in America. Built By working men without Assistance from Government, or large capitalist, this is Built By the Poor Saints & owned By them without assistance from any one Expcept the Lord. This opens a communication wi Between Salt Lake City & all the world. We Emigrated about3000 Saints during this year. We have Lost during the pastyear One of our Number of the Quorum of the TwelveApostles Viz Ezra Taft Benson & Albert Carrington was Appointed in his stead. President Brigham Young G A. Smith D. H. Wells & the Twelve Apostles have travelled from St Charles 
 Bear lake valley to St George in Washington County &President Brigham Young Preached during these Journies 43 Hours& 12 minutes according to the time I kept as recorded in my Journal. We also Esstablished the Joint Merchantile Coop-eration as a general whole sale store also ward stores. we have had sent unto us By the general Government the most wicked set of Judges & all government officers thathave Ever Been sent in Utah Territory, they are doingall they can to stir up the general Government to make war war upon us & to destroy us from off the Earth. We havehad some Aposticy from the Church. L. E. HarrisonWm S. Godby Henry W Lawrence Eli B. Kelsey & some others have Been cut off from the Church for Aposticy & they have formed themselve into a New Church thesame as other Apostates Have at different times and they have Become Spiritualist & pretend to receive Rev-ilations. Wickedness is increasing throughout this whole Nation & Exhertions are making to try to destroy the kingdom of God. The Nations of the Earth are becoming more & more fearful of the signs of the times & of the future Events which await them. We have had peace in these vallies since we came here as pioneers in 1847 with theException of the Buchannan war which cost the Nation $40,000000 dollars & cost us 40 miles travel & Back againwe have also had some Indians wars which has cost some lives & considerable property. The wicked of thisNation are determined if possible to destroy & scatter the saints during the year 1870 But the Saints are in the Hands of God as they Ever have Been, & God will defend them & fight their Battles if they will ownly befaithful & trust in him. 1870 will be an Eventfulyear in many respects. In fact Every year is Eventful now in this fast age God has set his hand to EsstablishZion & his Kingdom & he will accomplish in spite of Earth & Hell, wicked men & devils He will overthrow the wicked the, scorners, the Hipocritt, & unbelievers & save his Saints

We dedicate this Rail Road unto thee, the Lord our Godwe pray that thy Blessings may rest upon it, and upon those whohave Erected &and labored upon it.

 June 22nd 1870 ~ WednesdayB Young Jr Prayed President Young spoke 38 M[inutes] He said If I was to ask how many there are here today who was in Jackson Co I think there would be but few, or in Kirtland or far west but few I contrast the groth of this people with these daysIn the days of Joseph it was a hard Matter to get the people to believe in Revelation. But I told the people the day would come when the world would be flooded with Revelation, but fromthe devil. This began by a woman being put to sleep & gaveRevelation. Spiritualism began in this way all their Revel-ations go to deny Jesus Christ, the gospel & the AtonementThere are a few thousands who do know that God lives I with this people know it & are witnesses of it, & there neverwas a people as much blessed as this people on EarthWe have the privilege of Attending to the ordinances of the House ofGod for the dead, did the Zion of Enoch Or Adam, Abram Isaac, or Jacob, or the Twelve Apostles in the days of ChristNo they did not. But we are the people that are calledto do this work. What other people have been called to do this work I do not know of any, if this is our work what state of Mind are we in, are we after the world & the things of theworld this should not be. those who have turned away from their callings & seek for the things of the world will turnaway from the Church & Apostitize. The world are com-bined against & seek our destruction. they do not see the things of God, but we do, this is the difference between them and us. We know the things of God, but they do not, it is our duty to gather the poor & build up Zion, while they seek to destroy us. God will save all the Inhabitants of the Earth in some kingdomexcept the Sons of perdition. We are called to do that thatNo other people were Ever called to do. We are called to keep the Celestial Law of God upon Mount Zion All the Merchants who have got riches among us I cannot controll them, & if they do not repent they will be damned & goto Hell. Can you not see your position that you are calledto Redeem the dead. In the days of Joseph He felt vary Bad to see a Man Apostitize But now I feel if a man 
 June 22nd 1870wants to Apostitize I say let him go. Cut the thread& the least we say about the Apostates or the officers of Government the Better, & Mr Grant has been on a bed of Nettlesto know what the Mormons were agoing to do if they Passed the Collum Bill. I have told them I did notknow but God will tell us what to do & if we do it Hewill protect us in all things. We have No time to spareNot a Moment do all in our power to save ourselves& redeem our dead. you may think things are going slow but we are doing all we can. Now be kind to your families dont scold at them But pray in yourfamilies & do your duty to them. D H Wells spok 51 M[inutes]W Woodruff spoke 17 Minutes & said we did not realize our Privileges, if none of the Ancients Redeemed the dead we still have a greater work to do. I would not like to go into the spirit world & meet my friends who have died without thegospel & have them reproach me for not doing my duty towardsthem it is a great reponsibility to be a Prophet, Apostle or Elder. the saints should take the council given them, theAncients are not Perfect without us nor we without themthen let us labor diligently to fulfill our mission & do our duty & not sell our Birthright or make ship wreck of faith.John Taylor ^afternoon^ spoke 63 Minutes read the 38 chapter of Job & spoke upon it. spoke of the afflictions Job received at the hand of the Devil. xx F D Richards spoke 36 Minutes.

Snow spoke 45 Minutes He spoke of the Exhaltation of the Saints, theLord does not intend for the Saints to always live in dens &caves of the Earth but to build good fine Houses & Mansionswhen the Lord comes He will not Expect to Meet a Dirty lazy People But expects to Meet the Zion of God with Refinement & Glory as the Bride the Lambs wife already this zion isattracting the Attention of the world we should continue toimprove when we were called to go South I continued to 
 June 23rd 1870improve untill the last Moment Expecting to burn Every thing upExcept what we took south with us & I wanted to burn as muchas I could, but when we returned from Provo I Believed we were on our return to Jackson Co, & I shall still believe it untillI learn to the contrary. Those who follow Brigham Young will be much richer than those who do not we should feel that all we have is on the Altar to build up the Kingdom of God with.there is Nothing more glorious than to see an old man whohas grown Gray in the service of God, & in building up his workas we grow older we should grow better & more kind to our fam-ily. President Young says Politeness is in the heart & not in Bowing& scraping. When Moses came out the people came out to see him & did not come out with Banners & flags flying to greethim as they do President Young. When we were called to go South we united as the Heart of one Man & were ready to Burn up Evry thing we had, the Lord tryed us in thisBut when He found we would do as we were told he with-held our hand from burning up our property & restored itto us again in this I acknowlede the Hand of God in all thingsI was drowned in the Pacific & it cured me of a Head ake I had from my childhood. B Young jr spoke 32 M[inutes]spoke of the improvements since we came here Said there was 47 families in St Thomas, & 43 Babies, & one death last year.The U. S. Government sent an Army to drive us out of these MMountains & in three years they had a war that cost a Million of lives & $4,00000000000 dollars & the Army who came here turned traitors to the Government & did fightagainst the North. some people are anxious to keep cattle to go back to Jackson Co Mo with we shall not gowith ox teams but By Rail Road. R T Burton spoke 23 Minutes. In continually feasting there is danger of Eating to Much, But no danger of Getting to much spiritual food. In Nauvoo the Temple was built with gun ^trowel^ in one hand & the sword in the other & what Peace we have here is in consequence of our being ready to defend ourselves the firstcouncil given was to build forts in Evry settlement the 
 June 23rd 1870the Neglect of this has cost this Territy Millions of Dollars & many lives. Can we ask God to defend our families, while we Neglect the council given us.we should keep the word of wisdom & keep our arms & amunition in good order we should set a goodExample in Zion & not be seen chewing tobaco & with apipe in our Mouth or drinking whiskey.Afternoon Prayer By F.

But would say Brother Young will not let us starveit is time you laid up your grain I know as God livesthat if we had done right, laid up our grain as we havebeen councilled, we should not have been visited by thegrass hoppers.

Pratt spoke first & refered to the time he first[FIGURES] saw Joseph Smith in the same house whare the first Branch of theChurch was organized said he wished that there could be a smallplain history of Joseph Smith written by some one who had a goodMemory by some one who could remember the circumstances as theywere. said he received a testimony there that he knew the work was ofGod it was not by the Administration of Angels or open vision butby the Holy Ghost He made other remarks. He was followed By W. WoodruffI said there was one subject I wished to speak upon & that was writing & keeping a Journal of the dealings of God with us I have many times thought the Quorum of the Twelve & others considered me rather enthu-siastic upon this subject But when the Prophet Joseph organized theQuorum of the Twelve he Commanded them to write & keep a Journalor History of their lives & gave his reasons why they should do it I thinkthe Twelve Apostles & all the Elders of Israel who bear the Holy Priesthoodshould keep a Journal of their official acts & the dealings of God with themI would be glad to read the Acts of My forefathers if they had never herd of a God. But esspecially when men are called to stand at thehead of a Great dispensation like this & to build up the kingdom of God on the Earth to remain forever, they of all men on Earth ought to write & keep a true & correct History of the rise & progress of that Kingdom,of the Revelations of Jesus Christ & his dealings with us as we travel 
 Jan 20, 1872along in our pilgrimage. I have had this spirit upon me since I first Entered this Chirch I was Baptized the first sermon I herd & from that day untill now I have kept a daily Journal whenever I have herdJoseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I have always felt it my duty to write it. I have always felt uneasy I could not Eat drink or sleepin peace untill I did write it & my mind has been so Exercised uponthis subjects that when I herd Joseph Smith teach & I had not pen-cil & paper I would go home & set down & write that whole sermonalmost word for word & sentence By sentence as it was deliver & whenI had written it, it was taken from me I remembered it no morethis was the gift of God to me & the question has often rested me why arethese things so, why has this subject rested upon me more than other menagain another Question has rested upon my mind many times? whyhas the devil sought to take my life from the day I was born untill now more than other men, for I been a marked victim for thedevil from the day I was born untill now, and I can find but one answer & that is the devil knew if I got into the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter day Saints I would write the History of theChurch & leave on Record the doings, works, & teachings of the prophets& Apostles Elders & Saints in the latter days, & that I would attend tothe Ordinances of the House of God. For my Fathers Household & Friendsboth for the living & the dead. I am the ownly person in all the lineageof my Fathers Household Either on my Father or Mothers side whohas been in the Church & in a situation to do any thing for myFathers House I Baptized my Father & all his household that He had with him at the time including my step Mother & half sisterI am the ownly person that has attended to any of the ordinances of the Church for my Dead. Again I have recorded nearly allthe sermons & teachings that I Ever herd Joseph Smith deliver & many of the Quorum of the Twelve I have in my Journals scores of sermons of President Brigham Young that He does not know that Exist on Earth so of Orson Hyde, Parley Pratt, Orson Pratt, & others, onereason I have Been moved upon to write in Early days wasnearly all the Historians appointed in the Early History of the ChurchApostitized & took the Journals away with them which in a measure were lost to the Church. I still keep a daily Journal but I have not 
 Jan 20, 1872reported sermons much for many years for we have had scribes & reporters to keep a record of the sayings of the Prophets & Apostles &I rejoice & thank God for it does my soul good to look upon theselittle Boys sons of Brother George Q Cannon & others set at the reports table & report the sermons as they are delivered from the mouth of the Prophets & Apostles I would there were 10 whare their is but oneAnother Subject I wish to say a few words upon & that is the spiritof God to man, the Holy Ghost which is given to the saints, The inspiration of the Almighty which giveth the spirit of man under-standing it is the greatest testimony man can possess, his Eyes & Ears may be deceived in seeing the miracles such as the magicians in thedays of Moses or such as the fals Prophets & beasts of the last day will perform wbut when the Elect receive the Holy Ghost they will not be deceived [##Exodus 7:22##]but man is apt to look to high or Expect too great things so that theyoften times mistake the spirit of God & the inspiration of the Almightyit is not in the Thunder or whirlwind that we should look for the spirit of God but in the still small voice "The wind Bloweth whare it listeth& ye hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether it goeth so all is the spirit saith Jesus" [##John 3:8##] We should all become acquainted with this spirit & obey its voice for it hath preserved the prophets Apostles& Elders for the last 40 years in their travels upon the Earth. We haveall Experienced this from time to time our lives have been preservedby listning to the whisperings of that still small voice. When I was going to Boston in the spring of 1848 with my family I drove into the dooryard of one of the Brethren tied my Mules to a large oak tree & went to Bed in my carriage with my carriage ^family^ the spirit came upon me & told me to get up & move my ^carriage^ & my mules I did so & it was but a short time untill a whirlwing took that oak tree broak it into nom the ground & brought it some 12 rods & laid it prostrate in that dooryard & the body of fall whare my carriage stood & if I had not moved it I should have been killed with my family. Again when I was bri-nging the Eastern Saints to this valley when I arived in Pitsburgh I chartered a steemboat to take the saints to St Louis as soon asI had done it the spirit said to me dont go abord of that Boat. theCaptain released me & I chartered another the steemer that I first chartered started down the river soon took fire burned 
 Jan 20, 1872the wheel cha ropes into & nearly all the passenger Either burnedto death or drowned many in this Church have Experienced these things, & in all the travels & Emigrations of the saints for the last 40 years the preserving care of our Hevenly Father has been over us & we as a people have been preserved while the wicked havebeen destroyed upon Evry hand, the destruction of the saluda is the ownly case whare the saints have met with disaster in theirEmigration, and if Eli B. Kelsey who was the leader of the companyhad had the spirit of God & his office upon him he never wouldhave gone on board of that Boat or taken the saints on board of itI would Exhort all the Saints to get the spirit of God & keepit & live under its influence, & then they are always safe. And "this is the condemnation of the world that light has comeinto the world & men love darkness rather than light because theirdeeds are EvilElder G. Q. Cannon followed in some remarks the spirit of Godrested upon us & we had a good meetingJanuary 21, 1872 ~ Sunday21.
