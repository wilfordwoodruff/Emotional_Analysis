You wish to know how I feel. I am now forty years old, and have very little education, having never had any schooling.  My knowledge of the gospel, I fear, is less than of other things; having never had any desire for a mission. I have not posted myself, and living so much of my time on the ranch, have never officiated in any capacity, or addressed an audience of any kind. I firmly believe in the prin- ciples of the gospel, as far as I do under stand them, and wish to have my son as he grows up, well educated and pre- pared for the missionary field.

With regard to your appointing a presiding Elder over the remains  of the Eastern churches before you leave, I would say that you, are acquainted with the conditions of things there better than I am, and you have unquestionably got your Eye upon some person as the individual to fill that place, should you deem it expedient to appoint a presiding Elder.
