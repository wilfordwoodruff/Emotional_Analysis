Father Smith was sick and he asked us to lay hands on him. We did so and I Blessed him. The lasttime I saw Mother Smith she asked to have a Blessing at my hands Ifelt to Bless her. Before I started for St George in the spring I felt to BlessBr Pratt with an Apostles Blessing as far as I had the right & Power to do so. I laid my hands upon his head and blessed him as I felt led bythe spirit of the Lord. And when I am dead and gone all those Blessingsrecorded will be found in my Journals. I want to say I cannot say mourn over the death of Br Pratt. My friends who have been acquaintedwith my views know this. I cannot mourn over Apostles Prophets orinspired men, who have died in the faith of the Gospel of Christ. Any Man or woman who has kept the Celestial law of God on the Earth and have diedin the faith, will open their Eyes to a scene of Glory and Blessings andEternal Life that man cannot obtain upon any other principle. If Br Orson Pratt could speak today to this assembly what would be his voiceafter opening his Eyes in the spirit world after meeting with Joseph Smith, with Apostles, with Prophets, with the Elders of Israel and the Saints of God

 April 6, 1881time we may spend of these precious moments before this vast Assem-bly that we may satisfy ourselves, that we may satisfy our friend But O my soul when I think of this Eternal & immortal spirit that is chained up in these chains of mortality, that while the soul of man pants to mingle with those Eternal principles and Eternal intel-ligences which dwell around the throne of God and the Lamb, still we are confined here, limited, with all the inspirations we can get. sometimesI feel when I realize these things it would be a relief if I could break these bands as Brother Orson Pratt has done and open my Eyes in thespirit world and partake of the glory and blessings that await that manbut then again we must submit, we should be patient, we should besatisfied in regard to our condition on the Earth, in our Mortalstate, it will last but a vary little while. Now the few moments wehave to spend with yoo Brethren & sisters in speaking upon thisoccasion, what can we do, what do you expect we are going to giveyou a history of Orson Pratt? If we had a month with all the inspiration we could get from God in our mortal state we could not tell you the one thousandth part of the Glory, the exaltation, the power, the blessings and the Kingdoms, thrones and principalities that awaitthat man, and Every other Man that has kept the same Law. We cannot do it. No Eye hath seen, no Ear hath [heard] neither hath it Entered into the heart of man to conceive the glories that await the Saints of the living God. Now while I spent a few moments in talkingto the living I also Expect to refer to the dead, but it will take the trump of the sixth angel to sound to reveal the history of Orson Pratt to an assembled world. You cannot do it, I cannot doit, it is not in our power There are a great many things concerning Br Pratt that have not been written and never will be

After we left Monterey we passed througha piece of woods where the Methodists hold their camp meetings, and the frames of their canvas houses stood ready to be occupied when the summer-time should come again. We got backto the salt water swimming baths at half past eleven.Mr Badlam informed us that the ocean water is rather too cold, as a general thing, for bathing. It comes down along the coast from the Arctic RegionsThis bath-house, which has been arranged by the Southern Pacific Co. is an elegant place for bathing. There are three large plunge baths under the one roof divided by partitions. One compartment con-tains cold sea water, the next to it, water a little warmer, and the next to that, water still warmer. The bather can take his choice. The baths are surrounded by seats, flowering shrubs, and various adornments, and is beautifully lighted. There are private rooms where the bathers undress, and bathing dresses are furnished them.Both sexes indulge in these baths, and we were told that there are ladies who perform astonishing feats as divers and swimmers, who frequently are seen in the baths. Our carriage came for us. We returned to the hotel andat one o'clock took lunch, and from there went to the station to meet the train at two o'clock to carry us back toSan Francisco. Everything that wealth can command to make this place that we visited charming and attractive had been 
 After mingling with [them] what would be his voice to us? He would say "O ye Apostles of the Lamb of God, who occupy these seats, O ye fivethousand seventies, messengers to the Nations of the Earth. O ye six thou-sand High Priest, who hold the Melchesedec Priesthood of the order of the Son of God. O ye ten thousand Elders who occupy these Rocky mountains, And the Lesser Priesthood, And the hundred and fifty thousands Saints who have gathered to Zion can you afford to spend onde day or one hour to the neglect of the Kingdom of Good togather unto yourselves riches, or the honors of this world No he would say you cannot do it with safety, before the heavens, Before the Gods nor before one another. That would bye the voice of Bro Orson Prattto these Latter Day Saints could he speak to us. Now as far as I am concerned I need say but vary little more with regard to Bro Orson Pratt. He is what we call dead, his body is here before us His immortal soul, This Embryo of the God Head is in the spirit world, it is alive, it will live as long as Our Heavenly Father lives. Bro Pratt haspassed through many scenes of life in his Early ministrations he has many a time travelled through Illinois & Indianna preaching the gospelwhen He was vary sick from the ague yet though sick he would go out at night and Preach. He travelled thousands of miles in those Early days in this way in bearing his testimony of the gospel of Christ His Testimony is closed, His voice is hushed in death you nor Iwill not hear his voice any more untill we meet him in the spirit world and that will not be a great while at least for some of us. I wantto say to the Living let this admonition have its Effect upon us. what-ever we have got to do let us work while the day lasts. The Lord tells us in this code of revelations, in this testiment which He has givenunto us what awaits this generation if they will not repent 
 April [October] 6, 1881on this side of the veil. They are however recorded on the other side of the veil, he will meet his history there. I havebeen associated with Br Pratt, a good many years. The firstsermon I Ever herd him preach was in Aprail 1834, in a house in Kirtland. it was there I listened to the first Testimony I everheard from him also from Brigham Young, Oliver CowdryHyram Smith & Joseph Smith the Prophet and one or two others. I was associated with him then for this was Just beforewe started in Zions Camp for Missouri. Their are a few membersof Zions Camp here to day. Their is a small remnant of them leftAll those brethren who were in the camp, our travelling a thousandmiles led by a Prophet of God will remember the scenes we were called upon to pass through we were visited by the Cholera The first circumstance of the kind that we as a company ever experience. Br Orson Pratt whose body lies before us lay at thepoint of Death as also George A Smith and a number of others while some twenty of the Brethren were laid in the grave. TheLord took whom he would take, and preserved those whom Hewould preserve according to the council of his own will No man could pass through a much worse sickness than the Cholera, men weighing near towo hundred pounds were reduced to seventy or one hundred pounds in a vary short time. Br Pratt as I have said lay at the point of death, yet during his sickness hemanifested that indomitable determination that has governedhis whole life from that day to this. while death as it were soughtto overcome him, he rolled over upon his back closed his Eyes clasped his teeth and shut his hands and apparently said now death do your worst I defy you for in the name of Israels

 He tells us of the great Judgments that are to be poured out upon the Earthand the great responsibility we are under as the servants of the most High God in delivering our testimony and Preaching the Gospel. Bro Orson Prattmakes the ninth Apostle who have opened their Eyes in the spirit world since we came through Emigration Canyon on the 24 July in 1847. These things give me vary peculiar reflections it says varyloudly to Bro Woodruff Bro Taylor and a great many others "be ye also ready." It says to all these Apostles and all these Elders of Israel "Be ye also ready" whatever you have to do, do it whilethe day lasts. Be true and faithful to your God, to your covenants, to your Priesthood and to the mighty responsibility resting upon your head. This is the voice of the spirit of God unto us. I thank God for the gospel. I thank God for the promises of Eternal life which havebeen revealed unto us. I thank God for the Holy Priesthood.

Bro Orson Pratt has lived in this Church longer than any other man who has been in itPerhaps He has lived longer in it than vary few men ever will live in the Church and Kingdom of God in the fleshHe has crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times And hastravelled more miles than any other man in the Church. Hehas preached more sermons. He had brought many thousandsinto the Church. He had this revelation given to him whichI have read in your hearing he has lifted up his voice long &loud. He has declaired the words of life and salvation to thisGeneration, his garments are clean from the blood of theinhabitants of the Earth and his testimony will rise againstthis generation to condemn them. I believe there is no man living, I do not say it is so but give it as my belief that there is no man living to day in the whole gentile world that hasaccumulated By hard study and labor without the assistance ofteachers the same amount of mathematical, Philosphical and Astrionom-ical Knowledge that Br Orson Pratt obtained. He has probably publishedand written more upon science, astronomy, mathematics and upon the gospel of Christ than any other man in our Church if not in theUnited States.

I leaned upon the arm of Brother Wilcken who aided me greatly by assistingme up the mountain. It gave Brother Wilcken a good sweating to do so. We descended by another path, which was much easier than the one we climbed.It is remarkable that all these geyser springs are all on the one side of the creek. We spent the day very quietly.
