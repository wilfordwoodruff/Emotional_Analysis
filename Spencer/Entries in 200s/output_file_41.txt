I have already revealed my   will co[nce]rning the Natiaon through the mouth of my  servant Joseph, who sealed his Testimony with  his own Blood, which Testimony has been in force   upon all the world from the hour of his death. What I  the Lord have revealed in that Testiment and decreed  upon this Nation, and all the Nations of the Earth   shall be fulfilled, saith the Lord of Hosts.

The hour is at the door when   my wrath and indignation shall be poured out upon  the wicked of this Nation. Their murders, blas-  phemies, Lyings, whoredoms and abominations  have come up before my face and before the heavens  and the wrath of mine indignation is full. I have   decreed Plagues to go forth and lay waste mine  Enemies, and not many years hence they shall not  be left to pollute mine herraitage.

These revela-  tions and testimonies you have before you. Let my Saints  search the word of the Lord and treasure up wisdom and  be prepared for that which is to come As I have decreed  so shall my Judgments begin at the House of God.

The blood  of my servant Joseph & Hyrum and of mine Apostles  and Elders which have been shed for the word of God &  Testimony of Jesus Christ cries from the ground for   vengeance upon the Nation who have shed their blood  but that Blood shall spedily be avenged and shall scease  to cry unto me for the hour of Gods Judgmet is fully  come and shall be poured out without measure upon  the wicked.

As I told all the House of Israel by  my servant Moses that they should ask at my hand   for all those blessing which I the Lord had promised  Unto Israel in the Latter Days. And as I the Lord   Ordained mine Apostles who were with me in my  ministry, and Promised them that they should sit  upon Twelve Thrones Judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel [##Matthew 10:1##] [##Matthew 19:28##]  So I say unto you mine Apostles whom I have raised  up in these last days that I have ordained you to bear

 9  Myself, for I take whom I will take and preserve  in life them whom I will preserve according to  the council of my own will. And while my   servant John Taylor is your President I wish to  ask the rest of my servants of the Apostles the  Question Although you have one to Preside over  your Quorum and over the Church which is the order  of God in all Generations. Do you not all of you hold   the Apostleship which is the Highest Authority ever given  to man on Earth? You do. Therefore you hold in  commothen the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world  you each of you have power to unlock the Veil of  Eternity and hold convers[ation] with God the Father and  his Son Jesus Christ, and to have the Administration  of Angels. It is your right privailege & duty to inquire  of the Lord his mind & will concerning yourselves the inhab-  itants of Zion and their interest And whenever any   one of you receive the word of the Lord Let it be written and  presented in your councils and whatever by a united consent  you deem wisdom to be presented unto the people let it be presented   by the President my servant John Taylor as the word of the Lord, in  this way you will uphold him & strengthen his hands as all the  burthen [burden] should not rest upon one man. For thus saith the Lord  All of mine Apostles should be full of the Holy Ghost of Inspiration and  Revelation and know the mind & will of God and be prepared for that which   is to come Therefore let mine Apostles keep my commandments and obey my  laws And the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against you Fear not for lo I am with  you intill I come I come quickly Even so Amen.

 2  Home unto Zion in the Mountains of Israel For therse things   O our Father we feel to praise thy Holy Name. Thou hast made us many  promises through the mouth of thy servant Moses, and through many  of the ancient Prophets and Apostles who by inspiration and revelation   saw our day. Thou hast also made us many promises through the mouth  of thy servant Joseph whom thou hast raised up to lay the foundation  of thy Church and Kingdom in this last dispensation, and who has sealed   his testimony with his own blood. Thou hast also commanded us to  ask the Father in the name of thy Son Jesus Christ for all blessings prom-  ised onto us. There fore O Our Father, we come before thee for this  purpose Thou hast commanded us O Our God through the mouth of thy   Servant Joseph Smith the Prophet, that whenever any Nation or  people or house or individual rejects us or our testimony of Jesus   Christ or his gospel we should go alone by ourselves and clenanse our  feet with water pure water whether in heat or in cold and bear   testimony against that Nation, or man, or house, or people before thee   our Father and thy Son Jesus Christ and the Heavenly hosts Now our Father  who art in heaven we baeraer bear testimony unto thee that from the  hour that Moroni gave into the hands of thy servant Joseph the sacred  Record from the hill Cumorah wicked and ungodly men sought his life  and continued to persecute him up to the hour of his death and  finally shed his Blood and martered him with his Brother Hyram  in Carthage Jail for the word of God & Testimony of Jesus Christ and   the wicked of this Nation have continued to persecute thy servants  from th time to time, untill the present hour. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59-61##] [##Doctrine and Covenants 135:1-2##] The wicked of this Nation have  driven thy people from town to town from state to state and finally driven  them from the Nation into the wilderness, into these Mountains of Irsrael  and now our Enemies are not satisfied because we still live and prosper

 Dec 31, 1885  Thus Ends the year of 1885 I have written in my   Daily Journals for fifty one years since Jan 1, 1834  I have recorded many Events in the Church and kingdom   of God on Earth in these last days concerning our per-  secutions and Afflictions in the rise & Progress of the   Church. This year Ends with the prision crouded   with the Leading Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter Day Saints Because of Obeying the Celestial  Law of God in the Patriarchal Order of Marriage   And the presidency of the Church and Twelve Apostles  & Many other Leading Men are in Exile for our   Religion And we are now Approaching 1886   with the whole United States Government united  at war against us including the supreme court   President, Cabinet & both Houses of Congress seaem   now Determined to Mob us under the form of Law   The Edmunds Bill take away all the civil political   & Religious rights of the Latter Day Saints And   Nothing but the God of Heaven can safve us But   the God of Heaven will save his people and protect  his Church Zion & Kingdom and Fight the battles of  his Saints and Destroy our Enemies in his own  time & way He has said it & He will do it.

 Oct 3rd 1885  But the Dimocratit Judg Powers dont want to be out done by   a Republican Judge so he de[c]ides the Law will allow him to   bring in an Indictmen for Every day during the 3 years, which   would make 1095 indictments which would make  6570 months imprisionments or 547 1/2 years and $300 dollars  fine for Each Indictment would be $328,500 dollars   so they by this ruling they will imprision a Latter Day   Saint During Life & take all the property He has. Now comes  the last & trials of the saints. These Judges have formed a  platfore for the Elders of the church to stand upon & deside  which they will serve Either God or Baal And as they   come to trial some take one side & some the other out of   the whole Number so far up to date has been five persons   whove Deserted their wives & children, Broaken their covenants  Denyed thir religion & dishonored God, viz Arnold C. V. Spencer   Bishop John Sharp T O Angel Jr & Septmas W Sears  while Bishop Clawson ^& Son^ A. M. Cannon A. M. Musser P. P. Pratt   Brown of Ogen Watson & many others prefer to go to prision  with Honor than to have Liberty with Dishonor and this  is now the test which is to try all the Elders of Israel who  have obeyed the Celestial Law of Marriage. As a Historian  I would say I would rather be shot dead, in the streets, or  struck with lightnigng, than to Desert my children Break  my covenants turn my wives into the street & desert  them with whom I have made sacred Covenants, Deny   my religion & Dishonor God. The decision Iwe now make  will decide our Destiny for all time & Eternity. We   have but a short time to live here but a long Eternity to

I have been looking for his death for months, the last  time that I saw President Joseph Smith the Patriarch I was on my way to  England. Bro George A. Smith was with me. Father Smith was sick and he   asked us to lay hands on him. We did so and I Blessed him. The last  time I saw Mother Smith she asked to have a Blessing at my hands I  felt to Bless her. Before I started for St George in the spring I felt to Bless  Br Pratt with an Apostles Blessing as far as I had the right & Power   to do so. I laid my hands upon his head and blessed him as I felt led by  the spirit of the Lord. And when I am dead and gone all those Blessings  recorded will be found in my Journals. I want to say I cannot say   mourn over the death of Br Pratt. My friends who have been acquainted  with my views know this. I cannot mourn over Apostles Prophets or  inspired men, who have died in the faith of the Gospel of Christ. Any Man or   woman who has kept the Celestial law of God on the Earth and have died  in the faith, will open their Eyes to a scene of Glory and Blessings and  Eternal Life that man cannot obtain upon any other principle. If Br   Orson Pratt could speak today to this assembly what would be his voice  after opening his Eyes in the spirit world after meeting with Joseph   Smith, with Apostles, with Prophets, with the Elders of Israel and the Saints of God

 April 6, 1881  time we may spend of these precious moments before this vast Assem-  bly that we may satisfy ourselves, that we may satisfy our friend   But O my soul when I think of this Eternal & immortal spirit that   is chained up in these chains of mortality, that while the soul of   man pants to mingle with those Eternal principles and Eternal intel-  ligences which dwell around the throne of God and the Lamb, still we are   confined here, limited, with all the inspirations we can get. sometimes  I feel when I realize these things it would be a relief if I could break   these bands as Brother Orson Pratt has done and open my Eyes in the  spirit world and partake of the glory and blessings that await that man  but then again we must submit, we should be patient, we should be  satisfied in regard to our condition on the Earth, in our Mortal  state, it will last but a vary little while. Now the few moments we  have to spend with yoo Brethren & sisters in speaking upon this  occasion, what can we do, what do you expect we are going to give  you a history of Orson Pratt? If we had a month with all the   inspiration we could get from God in our mortal state we could not   tell you the one thousandth part of the Glory, the exaltation, the power,   the blessings and the Kingdoms, thrones and principalities that await  that man, and Every other Man that has kept the same Law. We cannot   do it. No Eye hath seen, no Ear hath [heard] neither hath it Entered into the   heart of man to conceive the glories that await the Saints of the   living God. Now while I spent a few moments in talking  to the living I also Expect to refer to the dead, but it will take the   trump of the sixth angel to sound to reveal the history of Orson   Pratt to an assembled world. You cannot do it, I cannot do  it, it is not in our power There are a great many things   concerning Br Pratt that have not been written and never will be

After we left Monterey we passed through  a piece of woods where the Methodists hold their   camp meetings, and the frames of their canvas   houses stood ready to be occupied when the   summer-time should come again. We got back  to the salt water swimming baths at half past eleven.  Mr Badlam informed us that the ocean water is   rather too cold, as a general thing, for bathing. It   comes down along the coast from the Arctic Regions  This bath-house, which has been arranged by the   Southern Pacific Co. is an elegant place for bathing.   There are three large plunge baths under the one   roof divided by partitions. One compartment con-  tains cold sea water, the next to it, water a little warmer,   and the next to that, water still warmer. The bather   can take his choice. The baths are surrounded by seats,   flowering shrubs, and various adornments, and   is beautifully lighted. There are private rooms where the   bathers undress, and bathing dresses are furnished them.  Both sexes indulge in these baths, and we were told that   there are ladies who perform astonishing feats as divers   and swimmers, who frequently are seen in the baths.   Our carriage came for us. We returned to the hotel and  at one o'clock took lunch, and from there went to the   station to meet the train at two o'clock to carry us back to  San Francisco. Everything that wealth can command to make   this place that we visited charming and attractive had been     
 After mingling with [them] what would be his voice to us? He would say   "O ye Apostles of the Lamb of God, who occupy these seats, O ye five  thousand seventies, messengers to the Nations of the Earth. O ye six thou-  sand High Priest, who hold the Melchesedec Priesthood of the order   of the Son of God. O ye ten thousand Elders who occupy these   Rocky mountains, And the Lesser Priesthood, And the hundred   and fifty thousands Saints who have gathered to Zion can you afford   to spend onde day or one hour to the neglect of the Kingdom of Good to  gather unto yourselves riches, or the honors of this world No he would   say you cannot do it with safety, before the heavens, Before the Gods   nor before one another. That would bye the voice of Bro Orson Pratt  to these Latter Day Saints could he speak to us. Now as far as I   am concerned I need say but vary little more with regard to Bro   Orson Pratt. He is what we call dead, his body is here before us   His immortal soul, This Embryo of the God Head is in the spirit world, it   is alive, it will live as long as Our Heavenly Father lives. Bro Pratt has  passed through many scenes of life in his Early ministrations he has   many a time travelled through Illinois & Indianna preaching the gospel  when He was vary sick from the ague yet though sick he would go out   at night and Preach. He travelled thousands of miles in those Early   days in this way in bearing his testimony of the gospel of Christ   His Testimony is closed, His voice is hushed in death you nor I  will not hear his voice any more untill we meet him in the spirit world   and that will not be a great while at least for some of us. I want  to say to the Living let this admonition have its Effect upon us. what-  ever we have got to do let us work while the day lasts. The Lord tells   us in this code of revelations, in this testiment which He has given  unto us what awaits this generation if they will not repent     
 April [October] 6, 1881  on this side of the veil. They are however recorded on the   other side of the veil, he will meet his history there. I have  been associated with Br Pratt, a good many years. The first  sermon I Ever herd him preach was in Aprail 1834, in a house   in Kirtland. it was there I listened to the first Testimony I ever  heard from him also from Brigham Young, Oliver Cowdry  Hyram Smith & Joseph Smith the Prophet and one or two   others. I was associated with him then for this was Just before  we started in Zions Camp for Missouri. Their are a few members  of Zions Camp here to day. Their is a small remnant of them left  All those brethren who were in the camp, our travelling a thousand  miles led by a Prophet of God will remember the scenes we   were called upon to pass through we were visited by the Cholera   The first circumstance of the kind that we as a company ever   experience. Br Orson Pratt whose body lies before us lay at the  point of Death as also George A Smith and a number of others   while some twenty of the Brethren were laid in the grave. The  Lord took whom he would take, and preserved those whom He  would preserve according to the council of his own will No man   could pass through a much worse sickness than the Cholera, men   weighing near towo hundred pounds were reduced to seventy   or one hundred pounds in a vary short time. Br Pratt as I   have said lay at the point of death, yet during his sickness he  manifested that indomitable determination that has governed  his whole life from that day to this. while death as it were sought  to overcome him, he rolled over upon his back closed his Eyes   clasped his teeth and shut his hands and apparently said   now death do your worst I defy you for in the name of Israels

 He tells us of the great Judgments that are to be poured out upon the Earth  and the great responsibility we are under as the servants of the most High   God in delivering our testimony and Preaching the Gospel. Bro Orson Pratt  makes the ninth Apostle who have opened their Eyes in the spirit   world since we came through Emigration Canyon on the 24 July   in 1847. These things give me vary peculiar reflections it says vary  loudly to Bro Woodruff Bro Taylor and a great many others "be   ye also ready." It says to all these Apostles and all these Elders   of Israel "Be ye also ready" whatever you have to do, do it while  the day lasts. Be true and faithful to your God, to your covenants,   to your Priesthood and to the mighty responsibility resting upon your   head. This is the voice of the spirit of God unto us. I thank God for   the gospel. I thank God for the promises of Eternal life which have  been revealed unto us. I thank God for the Holy Priesthood.   Yes we should be faithful we should magnify our calling that [we]   may in vary deed become saviors upon Mount Zion. There   are other Brethren to follow me and I do not wish to occupy any   more time But if I could speak to Brother Orson so that   He could hear me I would say      [written in red ink] Sleep on Brother Orson, But Ere long from this  The conquored tomb shall yield its captive prey  Then with thy Quorum Thou shalt reign in Bliss  An Apostle, A King and Priest to an Eternal Day [end of red ink]      I looked over my Journal and recorded on the following Page A syonopsis of my labors

Everything is gazed at and   measured according to the observer's idea as to their position   in life. We saw nature in her most beautiful aspects. We   saw places that made one thingk of Eden. Pride of life was   there. The love of the world; the lust for the things of the   world were there, but the love of God, reverence for Him   and His laws and His righteousness we did not see.

In the name of Jesus Christ I  am going to stand in the flesh and bear my testimony   of the Gospel of Christ to the Nations of the Earth That was  about the way he acted from that moment he began to recover  and He has lived with us since that day forty seven years  His history is before you, it is before the world as far as written  as far as we can obtain it. Bro Orson Pratt has lived in   this Church longer than any other man who has been in it  Perhaps He has lived longer in it than vary few men ever   will live in the Church and Kingdom of God in the flesh  He has crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times And has  travelled more miles than any other man in the Church. He  has preached more sermons. He had brought many thousands  into the Church. He had this revelation given to him which  I have read in your hearing he has lifted up his voice long &  loud. He has declaired the words of life and salvation to this  Generation, his garments are clean from the blood of the  inhabitants of the Earth and his testimony will rise against  this generation to condemn them. I believe there is no man   living, I do not say it is so but give it as my belief that there   is no man living to day in the whole gentile world that has  accumulated By hard study and labor without the assistance of  teachers the same amount of mathematical, Philosphical and Astrionom-  ical Knowledge that Br Orson Pratt obtained. He has probably published  and written more upon science, astronomy, mathematics and upon   the gospel of Christ than any other man in our Church if not in the  United States. He has done a great work, He has done a good work  [written in red ink] Continued on page Dec 31, 1881 [end of red ink]

When we reached Clover Dale it was with difficulty   I got to the house. I was suffering from a deadly   faintness. Brother Cannon laid his hands upon my   head and administered in prayer. I received   much benifit therefrom, as well as a cup of tea which   I drank. After dinner we took stage for 16 miles   to the Geysers. There were four horses on the stage  and twelve passengers and the driver. The road is   a canyon road, and in places is very dangerous.

He could play the   piano and was a very good singer, while the team   stopped to water at one place there was an old couple  who had what appeared to be a favorite dog.

 April 20, 1889  said to the old gentleman "look out for your dog!" at the   same time Mr Swan made cries such as a dog would   utter if he were run over. It was very laughable to see   the faces of the old people. They thought their dog was being   killed under the wheels of the coach. We reached the   Geysers at about 4 pm. We took dinner at 6:15 at  the Hotel and staid all night.      April 21, 1889 ~ Sunday      Sunday April 21st 1889   Mr Badlam and Mr Swan started off early up  the creek fishing. The rest of the party started up   the opposite ^side^ of the mountain, and examined all   the geyser springs, which were very interesting.   Steam issued from crevices from the sides of the  mountain to a great extent, other places boiling   water came forth, and in other places there were pools   when the water boiled with violence, as it would in a   pot over a very hot fire. I leaned upon the arm of   Brother Wilcken who aided me greatly by assisting  me up the mountain. It gave Brother Wilcken a   good sweating to do so. We descended by another path,   which was much easier than the one we climbed.  It is remarkable that all these geyser springs are   all on the one side of the creek. We spent the day   very quietly. Mr Badlam and Mr Swan returned   with about a hundred trout, which they had caught  in time for dinner, which we ate about six oclock.  Before dinner, Bro. Cannon & Bro. Wilcken & myself took a bath.

It was a dangerous journey in some respects  From the summitt we had a very extended view.   On clear days the driver said he could see the ocean.   Our descent was rapid, and we passed through   a beautiful country, reaching Calistoga a little   before one o'clock. This place was at one time con-  sidered a very fine watering place.
