The past week has been very warm, and wheat is running fast; many brethren are in high glee, and are calculating to commence cutting wheat about the 20th of June. The cut worm is devouring a portion of the wheat and corn crops. The peas are beginning to bloom beautifully; the potatoes and other crops are growing fine. At the same time we have the music of the gulls as they fly over our heads seeking for grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects, but they find very few to feed upon. There is a greater abundance of grass in all the valleys and mountains than we have had for two years.

The power of God has rested upon him, and his whole Soul has been filled with mercy, charity &amp; brotherly kindness towards this people, and his heart has been made glad, and his Spirit cheered to see the people rise up en masse and manifest a strong determination to live their religion, repent and forsake all their sins, and put away evil of every kind out of the midst of Israel. The people appear to feel the importance of awakening to a realizing sense of their duties, and magnifying their calling in the Holy Gospel and Priesthood. The Tabernacle on the Sabbath has been crowded to overflowing during the winter, and hundreds have to re- turn home who cannot get a chance to either sit or stand in the house. The assembly has been addressed during the winter mostly by the Presidency &amp; Twelve, and the Spirit and power of Revelation inspiration, teaching and counsel has rested upon them, and the hearts of thousands who were honest before God have been made glad through their words, while the wicked and ungodly have been made to fear and quake and fearfulness has surprized the hypocrite, because of the plainness of the word of God which has been made manifest in Zion. President Brigham Young has not been able to attend in the Tabernacle since he attended the funeral of J. M.

Wells who spoke much to the edification of the people all of which will appear in the Deseret News. For several sabbaths previous, the assembly has been addressed by President Kimball, who has spoke upon several subjects in great plainness, without any regard to any false tra- ditions which the people may have imbibed, and the people have been much instructed and benefitted in the plain teachings which they have received this winter. The Twelve have gone forth at the head of the Missionaries throughout every ward in this city during the winter, attending Ward meetings and meetings with the various quorums of the church in the Reformation, and I have spent one of the most interesting scenes of my life. I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for three months, and the Lord has labored with us and we think much good has been done.

We want to get enough Indigo seed for over two acres as a trial.

After hearing from him such explanations as he could furnish, in addition to the written evidence, we have decided:   Nathan Tanner, Jr., made to them from the decision of Bishop McQuarrie and Councilors upon the case decided by them July 22nd, 1891, by referring it back without hearing to the Bishop's court, to be there further disposed of, they should have entertained the appeal of Brother Nathan Tanner, and acted upon it.   complaint, in that he had a decision rendered against him without the formality of a hearing, and without having any opportunity to make a defense or justification or explanation of his conduct.   the ill-treatment which he alleges he had received from Brother Job Pingree; and thought he did not make a formal charge, it was somewhat in the nature of a charge, and was construed as a complaint against Brother Pingree.   But we have the decision, and in that decision Brother Tanner is condemned   Tanner has reason for feeling dissatisfied therewith, because he was not present at the trial of the case, and did not have an opportunity to defend himself, or to make an explanation.   of the irregularity of the proceedings before the Bishop's court. We think that no man's case should be tried without his having the fullest opportunity to defend himself; neither should judgment be pronounced against him, as in this case, without his having an opportunity to be heard and make an explanation.   ing Brother Tanner to recall the charges he had made, and apologise to Brother Pingree. In pursuance of that resolu- tion, the minutes state that Brother Tanner said he thought he had done so. "He had intended to do so to meet the resolution." He then said "I now here unqualifiedly recall every word that I have said with regard to that subject, and will now say that I regret that I ever used it. I regret that any reference was made to the subject here in this case, and I ask Brother Pingree's forgiveness." The minutes futher state that at the conclusion of Brother Tanner's  retraction, President Shurtliff asked Brother Pingree if that was satisfactory, and Brother Pingree answered in the negative. One of the councilors also said that it was not satisfactory to him.   Tanner, Jr., it has seemed to us that Brother Pingree should have been satisfied with that which he said, and not pushed the matter any further. He had unqualifiedly recalled every word he had said, he had regretted the reference that had been made to the subject, and he had asked forgiveness. Our judgment is that, that request of his should have been granted, and it should have been accepted as satisfactory, under the circumstances.   ward and make acknowledgment before the ward, and also before his quorum, for the things he has said in this case that have been signified by the Council as improper       counselors, that being the place where the statements were made.   counselors, and not in public, then it appears clear to us that he should not be required to go before the public in the ward and make acknowledgments, but that his acknowledgment should be confined to the place where the statements complained of were made, and to those who heard him in that place. Of this, we are not in a position to decide, be- cause we do not know whether his statement is sustained by evidence that he was only before the council when he made these allegations. But the last paragraphs in Section 42 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenents make very clear the point that a confession of wrong doing shall be confined to those who have heard or witnessed the wrong doing, and shall not be made more public than this.   Brothers Tanner and Pingree ought, in the most humble manner, to confess the wrongs that each has done, not only to each other, but to the Church, and to the quorum to which they belong, and show by their humility that they are sorry for the scandal which their conduct has created in the midst of the saints. We say this without entering into any ar- gument concerning the right or wrong of either party. It is very evident that a bad spirit has been engendered, and the saints have had their feelings hurt. Even at this distance from the scene we have been made to painfully feel that these brethren in their disputes were bringing discredit to the cause of Christ. One may say that the other was the origin or cause of all this, and that he was provoked to say and do certain things, because of the words or actions of the other. But even if this be true, it is not a sufficient justification for all that has been said and done in this dispute or difficulty between these brethren. They both should humble themselves before the Lord, and obtain his forgiveness, and endeavor to remove whatever bad impression their words or acts may have made upon their brethren and sisters in the Church.
