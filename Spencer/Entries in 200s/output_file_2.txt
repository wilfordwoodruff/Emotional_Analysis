and others. I am very much pleased with the appearance of the Standard; it is ably conducted, and I think it will prove a benefit to the Saints, and help to keep at bay some of our vile columniators who will not be so bare faced in their attacks when they see we have a paper that will defend our cause.  We learn by the late mails that there is much trouble in Oregon and Washington Territories; the Indians are having it pretty much all their own way. I am happy to say by recent articles from our missionaries in East Oregon, that all is peace with them. Prest. Young has talked of sending up about 14 Wagons to bring back loads of dried salmon to help out the scanty supplies of food in this country. Bro C. C. Rich is also making calculations to furnish some grain for this Territory in case we get too tightly pinched; but we feel thankful to our Heavenly Father for his gracious mercies in sending us a beautiful shower every week since Prest. J. M. Grant spoke upon "the dry moon", and exhorted the brethren to exercise faith for rain, which you may remember, when it commenced raining while he was preaching. The past week has been very warm, and wheat is running fast; many brethren are in high glee, and are calculating to commence cutting wheat about the 20th of June. The cut worm is devouring a portion of the wheat and corn crops. The peas are beginning to bloom beautifully; the potatoes and other crops are growing fine. At the same time we have the music of the gulls as they fly over our heads seeking for grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects, but they find very few to feed upon. There is a greater abundance of grass in all the valleys and mountains than we have had for two years. We can say the brethren continue busy planting corn and late crops, and all the old broke land is being cropped, which shows an untiring zeal in those who remain to secure for themselves ENDENTRY Historian's Office, G S L.

We hope that a light has arisen in the Post office department sufficient to cause the anxious wives of Missionaries not to despair of receiving letters from their absent, loving husbands, and give them an opportunity of writing by return mail.  The weather for the past month has been generally warm, but some days we have had a boisterious wind, but very little rain. The ground in many places is parched up. The wheat heading out a few inches from the ground which will not pay the expense of cutting. Some fields are ripening which gives a pleasing hope that there will be a portion harvested this season; we hope sufficient for all who profess to be Saints. The potatoes in many places are savaged by the tobacco worm, which strips the hills of all the leaves: but even these are turned to some advant- age, for the people gather them in buckets andc. and feed them to the chickens and pigs.  The drouth has done some good, for the people have been urged on by the prospect of scanty crops to labor incessantly so that a canal has been made to take the water from the Big Cottonwood Creek, which now is made ENDENTRY 10 Decem. 1856  Dft.

Editor of the Western Standard  Dear brother, After so much of a hard and snowy winter, un- equalled since we settled in these mountains, the past few days of sunny weather almost make us believe Spring has commenced; over 8 feet of snow has fallen this winter in our city. The snow has been 2 and 3 feet deep in our streets during the month of January; Northward it has been deeper: In Utah valley South there has not been so much. The cattle and sheep have been brought from the island where snow is about 3 feet deep, and many have been driven into the city from the ranges North Few have died in comparison to last year.  The abundance of snow in the mountains will be of much benefit the coming year for irrigation, and with such a gradual warm thaw as is going on at present, the land must receive a thorough soaking, which is cheering prospects to a community whose primary and chief dependence is Agricultural.  The Eastern mail for January made an attempt at crossing the mountains for the East, but only got up the first mountain where on finding the snow so very deep it was considered impracticable to proceed further. They returned finding one carrier froze to death in the snow.  Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weather would permit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake, and the mouths of Jordan, and to find what navigation is practicable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is at present making arrangements to boat fire wood from Black rock, from which point it can easily be drawn into the city.

The Bishops of the various Wards are making their calculations to finish off the Canal this Spring, so that the waters of the Big Cottonwood can be used on our farming land and in the city.  The reformation is progressing throughout this city and Territory with great interest; President Young has given much valuable information during the winter to both the Elders and people. The power of God has rested upon him, and his whole Soul has been filled with mercy, charity and brotherly kindness towards this people, and his heart has been made glad, and his Spirit cheered to see the people rise up en masse and manifest a strong determination to live their religion, repent and forsake all their sins, and put away evil of every kind out of the midst of Israel. The people appear to feel the importance of awakening to a realizing sense of their duties, and magnifying their calling in the Holy Gospel and Priesthood. The Tabernacle on the Sabbath has been crowded to overflowing during the winter, and hundreds have to re- turn home who cannot get a chance to either sit or stand in the house. The assembly has been addressed during the winter mostly by the Presidency and Twelve, and the Spirit and power of Revelation inspiration, teaching and counsel has rested upon them, and the hearts of thousands who were honest before God have been made glad through their words, while the wicked and ungodly have been made to fear and quake and fearfulness has surprized the hypocrite, because of the plainness of the word of God which has been made manifest in Zion. President Brigham Young has not been able to attend in the Tabernacle since he attended the funeral of J. M. Grant on the 4th December until last Sunday the 1st inst. when his appearance in the stand created a deep sensation throughout the vast assembly, who were congregated in the ENDENTRY This page is the reverse of previous page ENDENTRY He addressed the people for about one hour and a half with the power of God and his discourse was very instructive, and edifying, and the people deeply felt the force of his teachings upon practical religion, honoring God, bringing ourselves in subjection to the law of God, and rightly prizing the blessings which he bestows upon us. The loss man will meet with by committing sin, breaking his covenants and disobeying his H.  C. Kimball and D. H. Wells who spoke much to the edification of the people all of which will appear in the Deseret News. For several sabbaths previous, the assembly has been addressed by President Kimball, who has spoke upon several subjects in great plainness, without any regard to any false tra- ditions which the people may have imbibed, and the people have been much instructed and benefitted in the plain teachings which they have received this winter. The Twelve have gone forth at the head of the Missionaries throughout every ward in this city during the winter, attending Ward meetings and meetings with the various quorums of the church in the Reformation, and I have spent one of the most interesting scenes of my life. I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for three months, and the Lord has labored with us and we think much good has been done. The fruits of it are manifest among the people, and we are enjoying a healthy atmosphere, and the people seem determined to practice virtue and holiness and to put down vice and iniquity in all its forms.  I wish to give our friend Wm. C. Dodge credit for forwarding me a bottle of Quince cuttings, and a few black prince Strawbury roots, not having received any line or note with them, I had no explanation what  kind of Quinces the were, we have but few Quinces growing as yet in our city, we will graft them into what we have.

He has been dissatisfied with the decisions rendered, and has taken an appeal to us, as the first presidency of the Church. The evidence in the cases has been furnished by Brother A. W. Millgate your clerk.  We have carefully gone through all that has been submitted to us, and not entirely satisfied with the written evidence, we took the liberty of sending for President L. W. Shurtliff, to obtain information from him upon points which were not clear to us in the evidence submitted. After hearing from him such explanations as he could furnish, in addition to the written evidence, we have decided:  First—That instead of the Presidency of the stake and the High Council acting upon the appeal which Brother Nathan Tanner, Jr., made to them from the decision of Bishop McQuarrie and Councilors upon the case decided by them July 22nd, 1891, by referring it back without hearing to the Bishop's court, to be there further disposed of, they should have entertained the appeal of Brother Nathan Tanner, and acted upon it.  It appears clear from the evidence, so far as we can understand it, that Brother Tanner had a well grounded complaint, in that he had a decision rendered against him without the formality of a hearing, and without having any opportunity to make a defense or justification or explanation of his conduct.  It appears from the record that Brother Tanner had brought to the attention of the Bishop and his councilors the ill-treatment which he alleges he had received from Brother Job Pingree; and thought he did not make a formal charge, it was somewhat in the nature of a charge, and was construed as a complaint against Brother Pingree.  The record as submitted to us, does not contain the proceeding which took place before the Bishop's court.  But we have the decision, and in that decision Brother Tanner is condemned  While there may have been sufficient grounds for this decision against Brother Tanner, we think that Brother Tanner has reason for feeling dissatisfied therewith, because he was not present at the trial of the case, and did not have an opportunity to defend himself, or to make an explanation.  In expressing our judgemnt upon this point, we do not pronounce upon the merits, or demerits of the case, but of the irregularity of the proceedings before the Bishop's court. We think that no man's case should be tried without his having the fullest opportunity to defend himself; neither should judgment be pronounced against him, as in this case, without his having an opportunity to be heard and make an explanation.  Second,—In a trial before you on blank a resolution was adopted by the High Council requir- ing Brother Tanner to recall the charges he had made, and apologise to Brother Pingree. In pursuance of that resolu- tion, the minutes state that Brother Tanner said he thought he had done so. "He had intended to do so to meet the resolution." He then said "I now here unqualifiedly recall every word that I have said with regard to that subject, and will now say that I regret that I ever used it. I regret that any reference was made to the subject here in this case, and I ask Brother Pingree's forgiveness." The minutes futher state that at the conclusion of Brother Tanner's  retraction, President Shurtliff asked Brother Pingree if that was satisfactory, and Brother Pingree answered in the negative. One of the councilors also said that it was not satisfactory to him.  Of course, we can only judge by the minutes that are before us, but upon reading these words of Brother N. Tanner, Jr., it has seemed to us that Brother Pingree should have been satisfied with that which he said, and not pushed the matter any further. He had unqualifiedly recalled every word he had said, he had regretted the reference that had been made to the subject, and he had asked forgiveness. Our judgment is that, that request of his should have been granted, and it should have been accepted as satisfactory, under the circumstances.  Third—Brother Tanner appeals against the decision of the Presidency and Council that he should go before the ward and make acknowledgment before the ward, and also before his quorum, for the things he has said in this case that have been signified by the Council as improper  Brother Tanner in his appeal assigns as reasons for not complying with this, and appealing from the decision:  First.—Because he does not feel that an apology is due.  Second.—Because, if due at all, in his opinion the proper place would be before the council or the bishop and his counselors, that being the place where the statements were made.  If it be true that the statements which were objected to were made before the council or the bishop and his counselors, and not in public, then it appears clear to us that he should not be required to go before the public in the ward and make acknowledgments, but that his acknowledgment should be confined to the place where the statements complained of were made, and to those who heard him in that place. Of this, we are not in a position to decide, be- cause we do not know whether his statement is sustained by evidence that he was only before the council when he made these allegations. But the last paragraphs in Section 42 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenents make very clear the point that a confession of wrong doing shall be confined to those who have heard or witnessed the wrong doing, and shall not be made more public than this.  Now after thus deciding upon these points that have been submitted to us, it is clear to our minds that both Brothers Tanner and Pingree ought, in the most humble manner, to confess the wrongs that each has done, not only to each other, but to the Church, and to the quorum to which they belong, and show by their humility that they are sorry for the scandal which their conduct has created in the midst of the saints. We say this without entering into any ar- gument concerning the right or wrong of either party. It is very evident that a bad spirit has been engendered, and the saints have had their feelings hurt. Even at this distance from the scene we have been made to painfully feel that these brethren in their disputes were bringing discredit to the cause of Christ. One may say that the other was the origin or cause of all this, and that he was provoked to say and do certain things, because of the words or actions of the other. But even if this be true, it is not a sufficient justification for all that has been said and done in this dispute or difficulty between these brethren. They both should humble themselves before the Lord, and obtain his forgiveness, and endeavor to remove whatever bad impression their words or acts may have made upon their brethren and sisters in the Church.  With kindest regards, we remain, your Brethren,  W. WOODRUFF, GEO. Q. CANNON, JOS. F. SMITH.  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Dear Brother:  The time having arrived when we deem it advisable to release President Ward E. Pack from the duties of the presidency of the Sandwich Islands Mission to return home to his family and friends in Zion, we have deemed it wise and proper to appoint you to succeed him in that important position. We have instructed Elder Pack to turn over to you all books, papers and accounts, and to give you all information necessary to enable you to understandingly take hold of the duties of your new calling.  He will also transfer to you all properties, etc., as is usual on such occasions.  We believe Elder Pack has labored with great diligence and zeal in the performance of his duties, and in the guidance of the Church. We trust you will in like manner be blessed of the Lord; and that you will have s^m^uch success in your labors both temporal and spiritual, and that you will be enabled to bring many souls to a knowledge of the truth. To this end we pray God to abundantly bless you, to preserve you from all evil, and in due time bring you home in safety to the association of the people of God in Zion.

A perfect unity of sentiment was manifest throughout all our actions, each one felt well and appeared to enjoy a good degree of the Holy Spirit, it was a time long to be remembered by those who were there.

I asked him How this thing was going to come out. he replied if the Brethern would Let him Manage the Business; there should be no blood shed, but if not it would be the hardest Blow the Church ever had or would receive, that if he and Hyrum were ever taken again they Would be Massacread or he was not a Prophet of God, he said he wanted to Save Hyrum to avenge his Blood, he said that Hyrum was determined Not to Leave him but die with him, he told me to go and call Bro Hyrum Bro John Taylor and several others that I do not now recolect their Names, then he and I turned and walked up close to the Mansion, as we were walking along we heard the sound of a company of Horses and Men; as it was now dark he sent me ahead to see what they were on getting up I found a company of 20 Men from Carthage for about 17 ^having a Writ^ for some 17 Men. I talked with them a few Minutes and found out what they wanted and returned and Told Joseph, he told me to return and tell them he would see them the Next day at 10 Oclock, then I called the above named council togather and we went up to Joseph Chamber, there we talked over the subject of the Writ andc andc, and Joseph said it was the voice of the Spirit for him to go to the West ^among the Navives Natives^ and Take Hyrum and several others along with him and Look out a place for the Church  (NB. While siting on the Bank of the River he said he wanted Bro Hyrum to go aboard of the Maid of Iowa and Take Both their famalies to Ohio and Leave him to fight the Battles, at this time he said he wanted to save Hyrum to avenge his Blood). When the council was dismissed about 4 A.M. we all went out to Josephs West gate, there several of us halted. Joseph Turned and said something to me Like this Bro Markham I want to Leave you to Take charge of the Legion. thin I replied I will do as you want me whatever it may be.

Some who had been baptised we were unable to get any clue to whatever. They are so unsettled in their habits and are so continualy on the move from one Island to another that it is very difficult to keep track of them  For the last few months there has been but little interest manifested on these lands in regard to mormonism yet at places we have succeeded in awakening some interest among the people, but I think probably the great excitment is past, for mormonism is becoming pretty much of an old story. Almost anything new or strange will engage the interests of this people but the excitement soon wears off, when they again fall into their accostomed lethergy untill something else comes along to arouse their sleeping faculties.  The gathering has went on but slowly in consequence of the crops being cut off by worms, the past winter has been uncommonly dry, so that between the worms and the drought there will be but very little rained on this place this season.  The debts of the mission have been considerably lightened since last conference but are not entirely liquidated, the failure of the crops and other circumstances have rather been against us, but yet the Lord has been mindfull of us, and opened up the way before us in an unexpected manner, and I have no doubt but all will come out right. The Saints at this place feel well—better than at any other place where I have been on the Islands, but the best of them have many weaknesses and often times a person's patience is tried with them. When we get them into meeting they will feel first rate, one would think they could never intentionly do ^anything^ wrong, but they soon forget all that was told them, which makes it necessary to continue to tell them what is right and use the patience of a Job.
