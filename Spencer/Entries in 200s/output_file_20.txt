 1 The following is a copy of the Testimony of the Apostle Wilford Woodruff to be published to the whole worldSt George Temple Feb 22 1879To the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints throughout Zion and throughout the world GreetingI feel desireous to once more while in the flesh, By the word of God and Testimony of Jesus Christ to bear mytestimony unto you as the Church and Kingdom of God Esstablished on the Earth By the God of Heaven in this last dispensation and fullness of times. I also wish to bear my testimony to all Nations under heavens Emperors Kings, Presidents, Statesmen, Govornors, Judges, all Rulers and the Rulled, Jew and Gentile who dwell upon the face of the whole Earth My Testimony is this unto all Men and Nations. That you live in the day and hour of the Judgments of God Almighty. You live in the day and generation when the God of Israel has set his hand to perform his work his strange work in the Latter daysYoy live in the age in which God will bring to pass the fulfillment of that flood of Prophesy and Revelation which has been spoken by all the Prophets since the worldbegan, which stands recorded in the Sacred Books of Divine truth, And the fullfillment of those Revelationswill involve the Destiny of the whole world Jew and Gentile Rich and poor, High and low, saint and sinner Babylon and Zion. Therefore prepare yourselves O ye inhabitants of the Earth for the hour of Gods Judgments is at the doorAs it was in the days of Noah and Lot so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of man. [##Matthew 24:37##] First tothe Saints of God who have Entered into covenant with 
 2 the Lord and have been ordained unto the Holy Priesthood. if you are living your religion and Enjoying the spirit of inspiration which is your Dutyyou know as God Lives, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that He received the Administration of Angels, that He brought forth the Book of Mormon and translated it By the power of God. you know He received the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel, and the Holy Priesthood, and Apostleship, and the Keys there off, and He organized the Church of Christ the ownly true and living Churchupon the face of the whole Earth with its gifts and gracesthereoff with which the Lord is well pleased; youalso know Joseph Smith the Prophet left his testiment upon the Earth, and sealed that testiment with his own life and Blood, and that testiment is in force upon all the world. And that Testiment is filled with the Revelations of God that stands upon its pages like flames of Living fire, ready to be fulfilled upon all the inhabitants of the Earth. In this testiment the Lord has commanded his servants to go to all the world and Preach this gospel of the Kingdom to Every creature as far as doors can be opened. He has also commanded his servants to visit New York, Albany, & Boston, and all the Notible cities and villages of the world, and reproving them of their ungodly deeds and warning themof the Desolation and utter abolishment which awaits them if they reject the servants of God or their testimonyfor with you saith the Lord Almighty I will rend 
 3their Kingdoms. I will shake not ownly the Earth but the starry Heaven shall tremble you cannot see it now but soon you shall see it and know that I an Godye Latter Day Saints do ye not know these things are true. You do, and so do I, for the spirit of God bears Record, and the record is truth, and truth abideth foreverunder these circumstances what manner of men and women ought we to be [##3 Nephi 27:27##] are we prepared as a people for thesse great Events whichawait us as a people. Judge Ye, what is our duty as saints of the Living God. It is our duty to humble ourselves befor the Lord and call upon his name untill we are filled with the Holy Ghost and the spirit of Inspiration, walk in the Light of Christ, Pay our Tigesthes and offerings, keep thecommandments of God, and have faith in his word, remem-ber and honor our covenants, obligations, and ordinan-ces we hav Entered into in the Holy Places and Temples of our God. We should unite ourselves together in a temporal as well as spiritual point of view, as directed by the wise men of Israel. We should seek to build up the kingdomof God and Zion and not alone ourselves. When we do thiese theings then we are prepared as a people to let our Prayers ascend into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth fromone End of Heaven to the other, and they will be heard and answered upon our heads. Again this Testiment which Joseph Smith has left contains a Revelation and Commandment from God out of Heaven concerning the Patriarchal order of Marriage. The Lord has commanded us to have ^our^ wives and children sealed to us for time and Eternity that we may 
 4have them with us in our family organization in the Resurrection to dwell with us forever in the Eternal worlds that we may have an increas of posterity foreverin connextion with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the Ancient Patriarch's And God Our Heavenly Father Knowing that this was the ownly Law ordained by the Gods o[f] Eternity that would Exhalt Immortal Beings to Kingdoms, Thrones, Principalities, Powers and dominions and heirs of God, and Joint heirs of Jesus Christ to a fulness of Celestial Glory. I say the God of Israel knowing these things commanded Joseph Smiththe Prophet and the Latter Day Saints to obey this Law or you shall be damned Saith the Lord. Now after obeying this law for many years. The Congress of the United States, and the Supreme Judges of the Nation theyn stand forth and say you shall be damned if you do obey it. Now Ye Latter Day Saintswhat are you going to do under these circumstancesGod says we shall be damned of we do not obey the Law, Congress says we shall be damned if we do.It places us precisely in the same position that it did the Hebrews in the firey furnice [##Daniel 3##], or Daniel in the Den of Lions [##Daniel 6##}. The Enemies of Daniel counciled togetherand said we cannot find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the Law of his God. Our Enemies have persued the same cource and the Law makers and Judges have Joined with them, and made it a Law of Offence to obey one of the 
 5Laws of Our god Now who shall we obey God or Man. My voice is we shall obey God, we have but a short time to live here we have a long Eternity to liveon the other side of the Veil. This position takes the Matter ouentirely out of our hands, the warefare now is between God and the Nation. I am an American Citizen I was born and raised in the State of ConnecticutI wish to Ask the Law Makers and Judges a few questions. By what power was Columbus inspired to plead before the courts of Europe to assist him to fit outa fleet to cross the ocean, to find a western continentBy what power was He protected untill He accomplishedthis. By what Power was our forefathers inspired to crossthe ocean to inherit this land, and when they had inher-ited the land, and the yoak of bondage laid upon their necksby their Mother Country to grieveious to be bourrn they rose up as a Nation and Declaired there independanceand passed through an Eight years war at the Expensof much Blood and treasure, and finally maintained their Independance and Esstablished a free and Independant Government which was acknowledged by the Nations of the Earth. By what power was the Constitution of the United States inspired formed framed, and Adopted as the Supreme Law of the Land to be handed down as a rich Legacy to their posterity from Generation to Generation All these Blessings have been obtained by the Inspiration of Almighty God, and the will of heaven. This glorious instrument 
 7from the consequences thereof a, And all Rulers ofthis Nation as well as other Nations will have to give an account to the Judge of all the Earth for theUse they make of the power put into their handsVirtue Exhalteth a Nation while sin is a reproach toany People. The question was asked the Hebrews what God is there that is able to deliver you out of theHands of King Nebuchadnezzar A righteous answerof faith was given. We do not know that our God will deliver us out of your hands, But be it known unto theO King that we will not serve thy Gods, men worship the goldenImage which thou hast set up. [##Daniel 3:15-18##] So I say as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ I will not desert my wifvesand my children, and Disobey the commandments ofGod, for the sake of accomidating the public clammers ofa generation steeped in sin and Ripened for the Damnationof Hell I would rathr go to prision and to Death * ^see page^ 13I wish in this testimony to say to the Jews to the Rothchilds, to Diserillaand all rich Jews take your gold, and your silver from the hands of the Gentiles and Buy Jerrusalem, and all the Holy land and allthe Land given to Abraham your great Progenitor. Go to and Rebuild your city Jerrusalem and Temple for your deliveranceis at the door. Gather together your Brethren the Jews from all the Gentile Nations, for the fullness of the Gentiles has come in And the Lord has decreed that the Jews shall be gathered from all the Gentile Nations whether they have been driven into thereown land in fulfillment of the words of Moses your Law-Giver And this the will of your Great Eloheem And 
 8whenever you turn your hand to this work the Godof Israel will help you. You have a great future and destinybefore you and you cannot avoid fulfilling it You are the royal chosen seed and the God of your fathers have kept you distinct as a Nation for Eighteen hundred years under all the oppression of the whole Gentile world. Therefor Arise O Judah and return homewe ask you not to wait untill you believe in Jesus of Nazareth, but when you meet with Shilo your Kingyou will know him. Your Destiny is marked is marked out, you cannot avoid it. It is true that after you returnand gather your Nation home and rebuild your cityand Temple that the Gentiles may gather together theirarmies to go against you to Battle for to take a preyand to take a spoil which they will do for the words ofyour Prophets must be fulfilled. But when this afflictioncomes the same God that Lead Moses through the wildernesswill deliver you and your Shilo will come and s^t^and in your midst and will fight your Batteles and you willKnow him. And the affliction of the Jews will have an Endwhile the destruction of the Gentilesles will be so great that itwill take the whole house of Israel who are gathered about Jerres-alem seven months to bury the Dead of their EnemiesAnd the weapons of war will last them seven years for fuel so they need not go to any forest for wood. These are Tremendious sayings who can bear then Never-theless they are true and will be fulfilled according to thesayings of Ezekiel, Zachariah and other prophets though 
 9the Heavens and Earth Pass away not one jot or tittlewasll [will] fall unfulfilled. I would say to the Lamanits if I could speak to their understanding that you are alsoa Branch of the House of Irsrael, and once Belonged toPleasant Ephraim, and your forefathers have fallen through the same Example of unbelief and sin, as havethe Jews, and you areas their posterity have wandered in sin and darkness for Many Generations, and youlike the Jews have been driven and tramplled underthe feet of the Gentiles, and put to death through yourwars with Each other and with the white man,untill you are almost annihilated from off the EarthBut there is still a redemption and salvation for a Remnant of you in the Latter Days. It is time for you toscease your warefare with each other and sheding each others Blood, or making war upon your fellow mencease to shed Blood, learn to cultivate the Earth, and raise your food from the Earth. Call upon the great spiritto protect you and deliver you from Bondage and Darkness, and the Great Spirit will hear you and deliver you, and a Remnant of you will again becomea Delightsome people as your Forefathers were whenthey kept the commandments of God. Could I speakto the Ten Tribes of Israel in that North Country I would say call upon the God of your Fathers of Abraham Isaac & Jacob That your Prophets may come in Rememberance before God. That they may hear his voice, And no longer stay themselves but 
 10smite the rocks that the Mountains of Ice mayflow down at their presence. An high way shall becast up in the midst of the Great Deep [##Doctrine and Covenants 133:27##]. Their Enemies shall become a prey unto them. Bring forth yourRecords and Rich treasures unto three children of Ephraim the servants of the Lord in the Land of Zion, And theboundaries of the everlasting Hills shall tremble at your presence, And you shall fall down and be crowned with Glory Even in Zion by the Hands of the servantsof the Lord Ephr Even the chrilden of Ephraim, Andyou shall be filled with Songs of Everlasting JoyBehold this is the Blessing of the Everlasting God uponthe tribes of Israel, And the richer blessing upon the head of Ephraim and his fellows. These Eventsrefered to, are but a vary limited portion of the Revelations of God which are about to be fulfilledupon the heads of this Generation. I wish to warn allNations of the judgements of God which are at thereirdoor. Thrones will be cast down, Nations will beoverturned, Anarchy will reign, all barriers of Law will be trampled in the dust. You are about to be visitedwith war, the sword, famine, pestilence Plague Earthquakeswhirlwinds, tempest and with the flame of Devouringfire. For By fire and the sword will the Lord plead withall flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many [##Isaiah 66:16##]. The sword of the Lord is bathed in heaven and is about to fall [on] Idumea [##Isaiah 34:5##] or the world for his anger is kindled and the slain of the Lord will be many and who is able to abide these things 
 11And who will stand when He appeareth. The fig trees areleaving, and the signs of all heavens and Earth indicate the Coming of the Son of Man. The seals are about to be opened,the plagues to be poured forth, Your river and seas will be turned to Blood [##Revelation 16:3-4##], and to gaul, and the inhabitants of the Earthwill die of those plagues. And the unbelief of Great Babylonwith the whole Christian world will not make the truths ofGod without Effect. Let the world for an example look at the Ancient Cities of the Nations, whare is Thebes, Tyre,Sidon, Nineveh, And Babylon the Great which were builtto defy all time and all power but God himself? They were laid in the dust, and their inhabitants destroyed when they wereripened in iniquity and that to in fulfillment of the word of God unto them through the voice of humble men, who spakeas they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. In like mannerwas Jerrusalem destroyed and the Jews scattered among the Gentiles in fulfillment of the words of Moses and JesusChrist. Will the Lord any more spare the cities of theGentiles and Great Babylon than the ancient cities and the cities of the Jews? No, verrily No. The question may beasked why are these Judgments coming upon the world in the last days. I answer because of the wickedness ofthe inhabitants thereof. The vary Proclamation of the Angel of God when He delivered the fulness of the Gospel as recorded in the Revelations of St John, was "crying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of GodsJudgment is come". [##Revelation 14:7##] ^and when that proclamation was made to Joseph Smith the prophet it was half a centaury ago^ Light has come into the world andMen love darkness rather than the light because their deeds are Evil [##John 3:19-21##] 
 12The Lord has raised up Prophets And Apostleswho have cryed aloud to this Generation with the proc-lamation of the gospel for half a centaury and warned them of the Judgments which were to come, And theinhabitants of the Earth have rejected this Testimonyand shed the Blood of the Lords Anointed, and persecuted the Saints of God, And the consequence is that darkness covers the Earth, and gross darkness the people and theLord is withholding his spirit from the inhabitantsof the Earth and the Devil is ruling over his own Kingdom and sin wickedness and abominations of Every kind have increased a hundred fold within the last few years untill the whole Earth is filled with Murder whoredom Blasphemies and Every crime in the Black cataloguethat was manifest in the Antideluvian world or Sodem and Gomorrah untill the whole Earth groans under itsabominations, and the Heavens weep and all Eternityis pained And the Angels are waiting the Great command to go forth and reap down the Earth. This testimony I bear to all Nations under Heavens. This is my faith, my belief, and my opinion. I know they are true by theinspiration of Almighty God. And the decree of the supremecourt of the United States, bears me out in the opinion thatthe Constitution gives me the privilege of Enjoying my Belief, faith, and opinion in Religion if I do not act. Therefore the action, and Execution of ^all^ these TremendiousEvents I leave for the God of Heaven to Execute which He mostassuredly will. 
 13What I have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not myself And though the Heavens and [Earth] pass away my wordswill not pass away [##Matthew 24:35##] but will all be fulfilled saith the Lord of HostsI subscribe myself an Apostle of the Lord Jesus ChristAnd a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day SaintsThe following page was omitted in copy Wilford Woodruff* If I would not I would never be fit to associate with the prophetsand Patriarchs of old, and I could not But despise in my heart any man who professed to be a latter day saint who would dootherwise. Why should ^we^ fear man who ownly has power to kill the Body more than him who has power to cast both bodyand soul into Hell. Christ says when men speak all manners of Evil against you and persecute you for Righteousness sakerejoice and be Exceding Glad for so persecuted they the Prophets and Apostles who were before you [##Matthew 5:11-12##] I would say toall Israel treat your wives and children Kindly and keep the Commandments of God and trust in him and He will fightyour battles And I will say in the Name of Jesus Christ the son of the living God That Mormonism will Live and prosper, Zion will flourish, And the Kingdom of God will stand in Power, Glory, and Dominion as Davidsaw it when this Nation is broaken in peaces as a pottersvessel and laid in the dust and brought to Judgment orGod never spake by my mouth. Therefore I say to all theSaints throughout the world be faithful and tru to your GodTo your religion to your families and to yourselvesJesus of Nazereth has suffered death on the cross for 
 14 Feb 27, 1879the redemption of the world And his Apostles followedhis Example for the word of God and the Testimony of JesusChrist. And Joseph Smith has proved to the Heaven & EarthTo God Angels and Men that He would abide in his Covenant Even unto Death And none of us will ever be called to do any thing more. Any of us would certainly be ashamed to deny the faith to accomodate our Enemies then meet theProphets and Apostles in the spirit world. May God forbidthat this should be the case with any of the Blood of EphraimFebruary 27, 1879 ~ ThursdayFeb 27.

SpencerThe Myriads of Dead they often comeA mighty multitude in thought to meThey come from heaven Their lot to try on EarthThey come a brief time past, they died and leftNaught but a record that they had been hereSome Names are mighty, in a worldly senseAnd stand forth blazoned by the trump of FameWhile some are noted for the good they didTheir honest upright Philanthropic lives 
 Though many humble have sunk in deathUnto their names has fame lent not a BreathBut they are not forgotten Time has flungThe portals of the world unseen ajarAnd those that lived are stepping up and onTo exaltation by the help of FriendsThat living in mortality can aidThe dead and gone. The Plan of LifeAnd of salvation has been wisely laidThat all that will obey may enter inTo joy and to salvation blessed stateFor this we gather here as day By dayRolls on to join Endless EternityTo work for some Though humble they may beThat they can have their blessings whare they areFor this we gather on thy natal dayTo cheer thy heart and Bless the ones that areOf Kindred to thee, for the work is greatBut when all lend a helping hand in timeThy record will be finished and thy dead Redeemedwe wish the Joy and Peace this dayAnd all the comforts of this life we liveAnd all the blessings that our Lord can giveThat Blessed in time and in EternityThy soul shall cry Theirs nothing lacked by mewe humbly ask our Father and our GodTo ratify these words in heaven aboveAnd give thee all that mortals can receiveIn heaven above or while thou still shalt LiveAnd many days like this mayst thou still seeWhile we delight to help and honor thee

They have kept their Blood pure & separate fromall other tribes & People for generations All their women and girls were virtuous and the most reserved people to be found on the continent of America. They do not permit any white men to go into the presence of their wives & daughtersif they can help it.

This old Patriarch gave us a roomfacing the public square and furnished us with and fruit during our stay He said the Americans had called them wild men He said if they were they were virtuous He said among them for generations had been Death to any man who committed adultery, or seduced a wife or Daughter among them and it was vary seldom ever Done But when the Americans came they bring Christian Civilization with them and whordom & corruption and now if a man was put to death for seduction the Christian would call it murder and hang us for it.

 Oct 23 1881 [1879]of these seven villages raise large fields of corn, beansmellons & squashes & Peach orchards down on the Earthbelow them without Irrigation or water ownly what falls from heaven which is but vary little and they raisevary good crops. we find that sand holds moisturemuch better in a dry season than clay and soil. we wenton stone stepts & foot paths, some 500 feet to the Oribe village containing 1000 people with quite a quantity of children.This village was compackly built of rock laid up inmortar some four stories high all thes villages are builtOn the top of the highest rocks for defence in time of warThis village was about a quarter of a mile around. The day before our arival they had their great Dance whichkept up untill late at night and the people were rather stupid. we went on to the top of a four story housewhare we could get a good survey of the surrounding country. I found the men done the spining and a gooddeal of knitting. There was about to be a marriage in the village and all the men were gathered into the workshops to spin cotton warp for a pair of Blanketsfor the marriage couple, they spun on spindles they heldin their hands and rolled the spindle on their legs they raised the cotton themselves and when the Blanketis used the pair sleep under it the first night then laidaway as a sacred garment & never used again until the man dies then he is buried in it. The men werein their underground work shops I could not getthen to come out to hear Preaching so I went down 
 Oct 23, 1879into two of their work shops and spoke to them when they were at work but found them more interested intheir work than hearing the gospel Preached I spoke to one company of 20 to another of 30, and Ira Hatch interpeted it I saw one white Indian called Albinos man vary white There are some of this clan in nearly all of the villages. They are milk white much whiter than Amer-icans whether they are Blood of the Anicient Nephites or a freek of Nature I cannot say they are not vary popular among the Indians. After going through the village and on top of the Houses most of which are flat on top and covered with Ears of corn to dry from pure white to jet black, The Black was generally the bestthere was read yellow & blue. we then left the villagewe then travelled 12 miles over vary rough ground and camped for the night 5 M[iles]October 24, 1879 ~ Friday24 [FIGURES] Moqui village Arizona Br Lot Smith took the carriage around the bottom and Br Ira Hatch and myself took the riding horse Button throough theHe was quitesick with the Distemper we took the Indian trail and went onto the Mountain to the village of Shemopavy containing 400 Indian stands on the top of a Mountain, the village is in a compacted form it is 470 yards around the villagewe led our horse up the steep trail and stone stepts 500 feet they have to carry all their wood water corn and all supplies up this stone cliff, they and their forefathers have lived in this way for Generations for safety in timesof war.

An order or letter was put into my hands fromsome person in Nauvoo calling for £25 twenty five pounds from Mr Jeffreys As as I did not hear you speakof that, I wish to ask if that is all right. In paying Jones the $500 dollars, shall the $50 dollars you paid him or anymoney that I may get in New York or else whare, to help himto Liverpool, be considered a part of the $500 dollars ormust he have $500 dollars exclusive of what we help himto. Please write me a letter Directed to New York andanswer these questions and you will oblige me. & give me any othr council you see fit.

 I have made Enquiry among the Saints as I came along about furnishing the teams with a load of sumthing for the Templewheat seemed to be about the ownly thing that their was a prospect of getting and that generally was not thrashed, a number spoke of driving Beef cattle. I told them it would be acept-able. I spent the night with Br. Simpson B. Huffaker one mile forsouth of Green field he says he has about 400 bushels of wheat he will turn into the Temple. Israel Huffaker has about 150bushels, & Br Collins about 50 bushels, making about six hundred bushels of wheat in that Neighborhood, but it is 150 miles from Nauvoo. now by carrying it 18 miles they can get 5005 perbuild for it, now shall they sell it & get money for it & [send] or carry you the money, or can their be a Steem boatsent for it which can go within 30 miles, or will it be wisdom to convey it so far by land. they will get a mashine and thrash it before long would it not be well to writeBr Huffaker a letter upon the subject, & tel him what you wish him to do about it. it will be vary expesive carryingit so far by land. for further particulars enquire of BrWilliams.The two Laws Wm & Wilson havefollowed us or been on the road either before or behind us for thelast hundred miles. they came into Chicago a few minutesbehingd behind us. what their object is I have not yet fully knownthey are in town this morning. they have visited the churches & sants through the country trying to sell their land & property in Nauvoo for money, cattle or exchange for land in the county they had about succeeded in making a traid of this kind with the Saints in Toulon Ill untill we came along I put a veto upon it & broke it up & am going to do it evry whae I go for they are ownly trying to gull the Saints for they will loose 
 all they trade with them in this way for their is more mort-gages and attachments upon their property in Nauvoo than the valueof them. I do not know but their object in comeing here is to take boat to the Eastene State or Canidas to practice the same fraudwould it not be well to cauth^i^on all the Churches through the Neighbor & times & Season to beware of having any deal with them or the Fosters or Higbys. I should think any Saint ought to knowbetter than to deal with them. I should not think strange if theLaws were calculating to go to Canida to live. I think of cautioning the Saints in the East against dealing with those men, by a note in the prophet upon the subject, unless I am councilled otherwise for they are going about seeking whomethey may devour. I had but a few moments to write before the brethen started but I thought I would write a few lines. We cannot get a boat for Buffalo untill monday Morning it is now Saturday Morning unless we take a propeller to Oswego, this evening. My Respects to the quorum and all who inquire. Please direct to ^your^ letter to W Woodruff New York & also ask Elder Taylor to send to me the Last form of the Doctrines & Covenants as it was not out the last when I left, also send the last Neighbors & Times & season to NewYorkWilford WoodruffDr Brother, I had quite forgotten to let you know that I owe and want you to pay Mrs Parker North American Hotel, New Orleanstwenty Dolls for board, she's a widow, & I have been very unwilling to leave without having that settled, for honesty is the best policy after all. Brother Williams has an order to collect some debts due me on the way home which he will [pay]you for that purpose perhaps the whole Amt. if not do send it to her. andin regard to that note of Joseph's in the hands of Phelps if you can use it to better advantage against the estate for full amt. you in may do so if he will give it up this shall be his receipt for the same.yrs respectfully D Jones. 
 Prophet Office New York March 13th 1845Beloved Brother WoodruffJust as I was leaving Nauvoo Brother W W Phelpshanded me the wrtten verses on Latin requesting me to forward them to you, which I now do Praying my heavenlyFather to bless you and this I do the more heartily remembering at this moment some of our travels and camp dutieson our way to Missoure with our beloved Propet and Patrearchalive and well with us. O brother Woodruff never can orshould we forget the scenes we then passed throughWhevever I see or hear of a brothr who was with us in thatCamp I feel a thrill of interest swell my bosom thatcannot be expressed in our imperfect lannguage. I rejoicein those who have stood faithful, and hope, strongly hopethat our heavenly Father will feel after them andgenlty draw them back again to rally round the standand of truth bending in humble submission to the Orderof the Kingdom. I see by observation (and I thank God not byby experience) that it is a small thing or curcumstance thatfirst cawses or draws away our eye from the mark but howhowever small still it is a deviation and who knows how far it will not lead. I want you to remember me beforethe Lord that I may not have temptations stronger than Ican bear. All is well at Nauvoo first rate, and I feelas through it was well with you.

 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  121AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.CHAPTER II.ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP--MY MIS-SION TO ENGLAND.Joseph Smith, the Prophet, asked theLord what His will was concerning the Twelve, and the Lord answered in a revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in whichHe says: "Let them take leave of mySaints in the city Far West, on the 26thday of April next, on the building spotof my house, saith the Lord.  Let my servant  John Taylor, and also my ser-vant John E. Page, and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servantWillard Richards, be appointed to fillthe places of those who have fallen, andbe officially notified of their appoint-ment."It will be observed that this differsfrom nearly all other revelatios in thisrespect: a fixed day and a stated placewere given for the commencement ofthe mission.  When the revelation was given, all was peace and quietude in FarWest, Missouri, the city where most ofthe Latter-day Saints dwelt; but beforethe time came for its fulifillment, theSaints of God had been driven out of the State of Missouri into the State ofIllinois, under the edict of GovernorBoggs; and the Missourians had swornthat if all the other revelations of JosephSmith were fulfilled, that should not be.It stated the day and the place where theTwelve Apostles should take leave of the Saints, to go on their missions across thegreat waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-souri had declared that they would seethat it should not be fulfilled.It seemed as though the Lord, havinga foreknowledge of what would takeplace, had given the revelation in this manner to see whether the Apostleswould obey it at the risk of their lives.When the time drew near for the ful-fillment of this commandment of theLord, Brigham Young was the Presidentof the Twelve Apostles; Thomas B.  Marsh, who was the senior Apostle, hadfallen.  Brother Brigham called togetherthose of the Twelve who were then at Quincy, Illinois, to see what their mindswould be about going to Far West, to fulfillthe revelation. The Prophet Jos-eph and his brother Hyrum, Sidney Rig- don, Lyman Wight and Parley P. Prattwere in prison in Missouri at the time; but Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch, was at Quincy, Illinois.  He and otherswho were present did not think it wis-dom for us to attempt the journey, as our lives would be in great jeopardy. They thought the Lord would take the will for the deed.   But when President Young asked the Twelve what our feel-ings were upon the subject, we all of us, as the voice of one man, said the LordGod had spoken, and it was for us toobey. It was the Lord's business to takecare of His servants, and we would ful-fill the commandment, or die trying.To fully understand the risk the Twelve ran in making this journey, myreaders should remember that LilburnW. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-souri, had issued a proclamation, in which all the Latter-day Saints were re-quired to leave that State or be exter- minated. Far West had been capturedby the militia, who were really only an organized mob; the citizens had been compelled to give up their arms; all theleading men who could be got hold ofhad been taken prisoners; the rest ofthe Saints--men, women and children--had to flee as best they could out of theState to save their lives, leaving all theirhouses, lands and other property whichthey could not carry with them to betaken by the mob. In fact they shotdown the cattle and hogs of the Saintswherever they could find them, and robbed them of nearly everything they could lay their hands upon. Latter-daySaints were treated with merciless crueltyand had to endure the most outrageousabuses. It was with the greatest diffi-culty that many of them got out of the State, especially the prominent men; forthere were many men of the State atthat time, who acted as though they thought it no more harm to shoot aMormon than a mad dog. From this brief explanation you will be able to un-derstand why some of the brethrenthought we were not required to go backto Far West to start from there upon ourmission across the ocean to Europe.Having determined to carry out the 
 122  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINErequirement of the revelation, on the 18th of April, 1839, I took into my wagon Brigham Young and Orson Pratt: and Father Cutler took into his wagon John Taylor and George A. Smith, and we started for Far West.On the way we met John E. Page, who was going with his family, to Quincy,  Illinois. His wagon had turned over, and when we me him he was trying to gather up a barrel of soft soap with his hands. We helped him get up his wagon. He drove down into the valley below, left his wagon, and accompanied us on our way.On the night of the 25th of April, we arrived at Far West, and spent the night at the home of Morris Phelps, who was not there, however, himself; he, have been taken prisoner by the mob, was still in prison.On the morning of the 26th of April, 1839, notwithstanding the threats of our enemies that the revelation which was to be fulfilled this day should not be, and notwithstanding that ten thousand of the Saints had been driven out of the State by the edict of the governor, and though the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hy- rum Smith, with other leading men were in the hands of our enemies, in chains and in prison, we moved on to the tem- ple grounds in the city of Far West, and held a council, and fulfilled the revela-tion and commandment given unto us, and we performed many other things at the council.We excommunicated from the Church thirty-one persons, who had apostatized and become its enemies.The "Mission of the Twelve" was sung, and we then repaired to the south-east corner of the temple ground, and, with the assistance of Elder Alpheus  Cutler, the master workman of the building committee, laid the southeast chief corner stone of the temple, accord-ing to revelation.There were present of the Twelve Apostles: Brigham Young, Heber C.  Kimball, Orson Pratt, John E. Page, and John Taylor, who proceeded to ordain Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith to the Apostleship.The Twelve then took their leave of, and gave the parting hand to the follow-ing Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.  Butler, Elias Smith, Norman Shearer, William Burton, Stephen Markham, Shad- rach Roundy, William O. Clark; John  W. Clark, Hezekiah Peck, Darwin  Chase, Richard Howard, Mary Ann  Peck, Artimesia Granger, Martha Peck, Sarah Granger, Theodore Turley, Hi- ram Clark, and Daniel Shearer.Bidding good-by to the small remnant of the Saints who remained on the temple ground to see us fulfill the revelation and commandments of God, we turned our backs on Far West and Missouri, and returned to Illinois. We had accom-plished the mission without a dog moving his tongue at us, or any man saying, "Why do you do so?"We crossed the Mississippi river on the steam ferry, entered Quincy on the 2d of May, and all had the joy of reaching our families once more in peace and safety.There was an incident connected with our journey that is worthy of record.While we were on our way to fulfill the revelation, Joseph the Prophet, and his companions in chains had been liber-ated, through the blessings of God, from their enemies and prison, and they passed us. We were not far distant from each other, but neither party knew it. They were making their way to their families in Illinois, while we were traveling to Far West into the midts of our enemies. So they came home to their families and friends before our returnMay the 3d was a very interesting day to me, as well as to others. In company with five others of the quorum of the Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to Mr. Cleveland's, to visit Brother Joseph Smith and his family.Once more I had the happy privilege of taking Brother Joseph by the hand. Two years had rolled away since I had seen his face. He greeted us with great joy, as did Hyrum Smith and Lyman  Wight, all of who had escaped from their imprisonment together. They had been confined in prision six months, and had been under sentence of death three times; yet their lives were in the hands  of God, and He had delivered them, and they were now mingling with their wives, children and friends, and out of the reach of the mob. Joseph was frank, open and familiar as usual, and our rejoicing was great.No man can understand the joyful sen- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  123sations created by such a meeting, ex-cept those who have been in tribulationfor the gospel's sake.After spending the day together, wereturned to our families at night.On the day following, May 4th, we met in conference at Quincy, the ProphetJoseph presiding, which caused great joyand rejoicing to all the Saints.On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smith addressed the assembly, followed bySidney Rigdon and the Twelve Apostles. The Spirit of the Lord was poured outupon us, and we had a glorious day.On May 6th, I met with the Seventies, and we ordained sixty men into thequorums of elders and seventies. BrotherJoseph met with the Twelve, bishops and elders, at Bishop Partridge's house; andthere were a number with us who were wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them was Isaac Laney, who had been, in com-pany with about twenty others, at themill, when a large armed mob firedamong them with rifles and otherweapons, and shot down seventeen of thebrethren, and wounded more. BrotherLaney fled from the scene, but theypoured a shower of lead after him, whichpierced his body through and through.He showed me eleven bullet holes in his body. There were twenty-seven in hiscoat was literally cut to pieces. Oneball entered one arm-pit and came out at the other.Another entered his back and cameout at the breast. A ball passed througheach hip, each leg and each arm. Allthese shots were received while he wasrunning for life, and, strange as it mayappear, though he had also one of hisribs broken, he was able to outrun his enemies, and his life was saved. We can only acklnowledge this deliveranceto be by the power and mercy of God.President Joseph Young was alsoamong the number. He also fled, andalthough the balls flew around him likehail, he was not wounded. How myster-ious are the ways of the Lord!Before starting on our missions toEngland, we were under the necessity of settling our families. A place called Commerce, afterwards named Nauvoo, was selected as the place at which our people should settle.I left Quincy, in company with Brother Brigham Young and our families on the 15th of May, and arrived in Commerce on the 18th. After an inter-view with Joseph we crossed the river at Montrose, Iowa. President Brigham Young and myself, with our families,occupied one room about fourteen feet square. Finally Brother Young obtained another room and moved into it by him-self. Then Brother Orson Pratt and family moved into the same room with myself and family.While I was living in this cabin in the old barracks, we experienced a day of God's power with the Prophet Joseph.It was a very sickly time and Joseph hadgiven up his home in Commerce to the sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-yard and was living in that himself. The large number of Saints who hadbeen driven out of Missouri, were flock-ing into Commerce; but had homesto go into, and were living in wagons,in tents, and on the ground. Many,therefore, were sick through the ex-posure they were subjected to. Bro-ther Joseph had waited on the sick,until he was worn out and nearly sickhimself.On the morning of the 22nd of July,1839, he arose reflecting upon the sit-uation of the Saints of God in theirpersecutions and afflictions, and he called upon the Lord in prayer, and thepower of God rested upon him mightily, and as Jesus healed all the sick aroundHim in His day, to Joseph, the Prophetof God, healed all around on this occa-sion. He healed all in his house anddoor-yard, then, in company with Sidney Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he went through among the sick lying onthe bank of the river, and he com-manded them in a loud voice, in thename of Jesus Christ, to come up andbe made whole; and they were all healed. When he healed all that were sick on the east side of the river, they crossedthe Mississippi river in a ferry-boat tothe east side, to Montrose, where wewere. The first house they went intowas President Brigham Young's. Hewas sick on his bed at the time. TheProphet went into his house and healedhim, and they all came out together. As they were passing by my door, Brother Joseph said: &quot;Brother Woodruff, fol-low me." These were the only words 
 124  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE. spoken by any of the company from thetime they left Brother Brigham's housetill we crossed the public square, andentered Brother Fordham's house. Bro-ther Fordham had been dying for anhour, and we expected each minutewould be his last.I felt the power of God that wasoverwhelming His Prophet.When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,and took him by the right hand; in hisleft hand he held his hat.He saw that Brother Fordham's eyeswere glazed, and that he was speechlessand unconscious.After taking hold of his hand, helooked down into the dying man's faceand said: "Brother Fordham do younot know me?" At first he made no reply; but we could all see the effect ofthe spirit of God resting upon him.He again said: "Elijah, do you notknow me?"With a low whisper, Brother Ford-ham answered, "Yes!"The Prophet then said, "Have younot faith to be healed?"The answer, which was a little plainerthan before, was: "I am afraid it is toolate. If you had come sooner, I thinkit might have been."He had the appearance of a man wak-ing from sleep. It was the sleep ofdeath.Joseph then said: "Do you believethat Jesus is the Christ?"&quot;I do, Brother Joseph,&quot; was the re-sponse.Then the Prophet of God spoke witha loud voice, as in the majesty of theGodhead: "Elijah, I command you, inthe name of Jesus of Nazareth, to ariseand be made whole!"The words of the Prophet were notlike the words of man, but like the voice of God. It seemed to me that thehouse shook from its foundation.Elijah Fordham leaped from his bedlike a man raised from the dead. Ahealthy color came to his face, and lifewas manifested in every act.His feet were done up in Indian mealpoultices. He kicked them off his feet,scattered the contents, and then calledfor his clothes and put them on. Heasked for a bowl of bread and milk, andate it; then put on his hat and followedus into the street, to visit others whowere sick.The unbeliever may ask: "Was therenot deception in this?"If there is any deception in the mindof the believer, there was certainlynone with Elijah Fordham, the dyingman, nor with those who were presentwith him, for in a few minutes he wouldhave been in the spirit world, had henot been rescued. Through the bless-ing of God, he lived up till 1880, inwhich year he died in Utah, while allwho were with him on that occasion,with the exception of one, are in thespirit world.Among the number were Joseph andHyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, BrighamYoung, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt.Wilford Woodruff is the only one livingwho was present at that time, and hewill soon mingle with those who havegone.As soon as we left Brother Fordham'shouse, we went into the house of Joseph B. Noble, who was very low and danger-ously sick.When we entered the house, BrotherJoseph took him by the hand and com-manded him, in the name of JesusChrist, to arise and be made whole.He did arise and was immediatelyhealed.While this was going on the wickedmob in the place, led by one Kilburn, had become alarmed, and followed usinto Brother Noble's house.Before they arrived there, BrotherJoseph had called upon Brother Ford-ham to offer prayer.While he was praying, the mob en-tered with all the evil spirits accom-panying them.As soon as they entered, BrotherFordham, who was praying, fainted andsank to the floor.When Joseph saw the mob in thehouse, he arose and had the room clearedof both that class of men and their at-tendant devils. Then Brother Fordhamimmediately revived and finished hisprayer.This case of Brother Noble's was thelast one of healing upon that day. It was greatest day for the manifestation ofthe power of God through the gift of 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  125healing since the organization of theChurch.When we left Brother Noble, theProphet Joseph went, with those who accompanied him from the other side tothe banks of the river, to return home.While waiting for the ferry-boat, aman of the world knowing of the mir-acles which had been performed, cameto him and asked him if he would notgo heal two twin children of hisabout five months old, who were both lying sick nigh unto death.They were some two miles from Mon- trose.The Prophet said he could not go;but, after pausing some time, he saidhe would send some one to heal them;and he turned to me and said:  "You go with the man and heal his children."He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to me, andtold me to wipe their faces with thehandkerchief when I administered tothem, and they should be healed.  Healso said unto me:  "As long as you willkeep that handkerchief, it shall remaina league between you and me."I went with the man, and did asthe Prophet commanded me, and the chil-dren were healed.I have possession of the handkerchief unto this day.On the first of July, 1839, JosephSmith and his counselors, Sydney Rig- don and Hyrum Smith, crossed the river to Montrose, to spend the day with theTwelve, and set them apart and blessthem, before they started unon their missions.  There were twelve of us whomet there, and we all dined in my house.After dinner, we assembled at Brother Brigham Young's house for our meeting.Brother Hyrum Smith opened by prayer; after which the Presidency laying on of hands|laidtheir hands upon our heads and gave each of us a blessing.President Rigdon was mouth in bless-ing me, and also blessed Sisters Young,Taylor and Woodruff.The prophet Joseph promised us if wewould be faithful, we should be blessed upon our mission, have many souls as seals of our ministry, and return againin peace and safety to our families and friends; all of which was fulfilled.Brother Hyrum advised me to preachthe first principles of the gospel; hethought that was about as much as thisgeneration could endure.Then Joseph arose and preached someprecious things of the kingdom of God unto us, in the power of the Holy Ghost; some of which I here copy from myjournal:"Ever keep in exercise the principleof mercy, and be ready to forgive ourbrethren on the first intimation of theirrepentance and desire for forgiveness; for our Heavenly Father will be equally as merciful unto us.  We also ought tobe willing to repent of and confess oursins, and keep nothing back.  Let theTwelve be humble and not be exalted,and beware of pride and not seek to ex-cel one another, but act for each other's good, and honorably make mention ofeach other's names in prayer before the Lord and before your fellow-men. Do not backbite or devour a brother.  Theelders of Israel should seek to learn byprecept and example in this late age ofthe world and not be obliged to learneverything we know by sad experience. I trust the remainder of the Twelve willlearn wisdom and not follow the exampleof those who have fallen.  When the Twelve, or any other witnesses of JesusChrist, stand before the congregationsof the earth, and they preach in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, and the people are astonished and confounded at the doctrine, and say&apos;That man has preached a powerful ser-mon,' then let that man or those mentake care that they do not ascribe theglory unto themselves, but be carefulthat they are humble, and ascribe the glory to God and the Lamb; for it is bythe power of the Holy Priesthood andthe Holy Ghost that they have the power thus to speak."Who art thou, O man, but dust! andfrom whom dost thou receive thy powerand blessings, but from God?"Then let the Twelve Apostles andElders of Israel observe this key, and bewise:  Ye are not sent out to be taught, but to teach."Let every man be sober, be vigilant,and let all his words be seasoned with grace, and keep in mind it is a day of warning, and not of many words."Act honestly before God and man;beware of sophistry, such as bowing and 
 126  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.scraping unto men in whom you have noconfidence. Be honest, open, and frankin all your intercourse with mankind."I wish to say to the Twelve and allthe Saints, to profit by this importantkey, that in all your trials, troubles,temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprison-ments and deaths, see to it that you donot betray Jesus Christ, that you do notbetray the revelations of God, whetherin the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doc- trine and Covenants, or any of thewords of God."Yea, in all your troubles, see thatyou do not this thing, lest innocentblood be found upon your skirts, and yego down to hell."We may ever know by this sign thatthere is danger of our being led to a falland apostasy when we give way to thedevil, so as to neglect the first knownduty; but whatever you do, do not be-tray your friend."The foregoing are some of the instruc-tions given to the Twelve the the Prophet Joseph, before they started upon theirmissions.Inasmuch as the devil had been in a measure thwarted by the Twelve goingto Far West, and returning withoutharm, it seemed as though the destroyerwas determined to make some other at-tempt upon us to hinder us from per-forming our missions; for it seemed thatas soon as any one of the Apostles beganto prepare for departing, he was smittenwith chills and fever or sickness of somekind.Nearly all of the quorum of theTwelve or their families began to besick, so it still required the exercise of a good deal of faith and perseverance tostart off on a mission.On the 25th of July, for the first timein my life, I was attacked with chills andfever; and this I had every other day,and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-trate.My wife, Phoebe, was also soon takendown with the chills and fever, as werequite a number of the Twelve.I passed thirteen days in Montrosewith my family, after I was taken sick,before I started on my mission.The 7th of August was the last day Ispent at home in Montrose, and althoughsick with the chills and fever the most of the day, I made what preparations Icould to start on the morrow on a mis-sion of four thousand miles, to preachthe gospel to the nations of the earth,and this, too, without purse or scrip, with disease resting upon me, and astroke of fever and ague once every twodays.Early upon the morning of the 8th ofAugust, I arose from my bed of sickness,laid my hands upon the head of mysick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I then departed from the embrace of mycompanion, and left her almost withoutfood or the necessaries of life.She parted from me with the fortitudethat becomes a Saint, realizing the re-sponsibilities of her companion. I quotefrom my journal:"Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer;remember me in your prayers. I leavethese pages for your perusal when I amgone. I shall see thy face again in theflesh. I go to obey the commands ofJesus Christ."Although feeble, I walked to thebanks of the Mississippi river. TherePresident Young took me in a canoe(having no other conveyance) and pad-dled me across the river.When we landed, I lay down on aside of sole leather, by the post office,to rest.Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God,came along and looked at me."Well, Brother Woodruff," said he,"You have started upon your mission.""Yes," said I, "but I feel and lookmore like a subject for the dissectingroom than a missionary."Joseph replied: "What did you saythat for? Get up, and go along; allwill be right with you!"I name these incidents that the readermay know how the brethren of theTwelve Apostles started upon their mis-sions to England, in 1839.Elder John Taylor was going with me,and we were the first two of the quorumof the Twelve who started on theirmission.Brother Taylor was about the onlyman in the quorum that was not sick.Soon a brother came along with awagon, and took us in. As we weredriving through the place, we came toParley P. Pratt, who was stripped to theshirt and pants with his head and feet 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  127bare. He was hewing a log, preparingto build a cabin.He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have no money, but I have an empty purse,which I will give you." He brought itto me, and I thanked him for it.We went a few rods further, and me, Brother Heber C. Kimball, in the samecondition, also hewing a log, towardsbuilding a cabin.He said: "As Parley has given you a purse, I have got a dollar I will give youto put in it."He gave me both a dollar and a bless-ing.We drove sixteen miles across a prairie,and spent the night with a Brother Mer- rill. The day following we rode tenmiles, to a Brother Perkins', and he tookus in his wagon to Macomb, and fromthence to Brother Don Carlos Smith's.I rode four hours during the day overa very rough road of stones and stumps,lying on my back in the bottom of thewagon, shaking with the ague, and Isuffered much.We held a meeting in a grove nearDon Carlos Smith's, and here Elder Taylor baptized George Miller, whoafterwards was ordained a bishop.At the meeting the Saints gave us ninedollars, and George Miller gave us ahorse to help us on our journey.I rode to Rochester with Father Col- trin, where I had an interview withseveral families of the Fox Island Saints,whom I had brought up with me from Fox Islands in 1838. I spent severaldays with them and at Springfield, whereElder Taylor published fifteen hundredcopies, in pamphlet form, of a briefsketch of the persecutions and sufferingsof the Latter-day Saints, inflicted by theinhabitants of Missouri.We sold our horse, and in companywith Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor andmyself left Springfield, and continuedour journey.I had the chills and fever nearly everyother day, which made riding in a lum-ber wagon very distressing to me, es-pecially when I shook with the ague.On the 24th of August, we rode toTerre Haute, and spent the night withDr. Modisett. I suffered much with thechills and fever.Elder John Taylor up to this time hadappeared to enjoy excellent health, butthe destroyer did not intend to makehim an exception to the rest of theApostles. On the 28th of August, hefell to the ground as though he had beenknocked down. He fainted away, butsoon revived. On the following day,however, the enemy made a powerfulattack upon his life. He fainted awayseveral times, and it seemed as thoughhe would die. We stopped several hourswith him at a house by the wayside.We then took him into the wagon anddrove to Horace S. Eldredge's andspent the remainder of the day and nightdoctoring him.In the morning Brother Taylor was sofar recovered that he thought he wouldbe able to ride. So we started on ourjourney on the morning of the 30th, andwe traveled forty miles, to Louisville,and spent the night with the family ofBrother James Townsend.We felt terribly shaken up, being insuch a weak state. Brother Townsendwas away from home, but we were kindlyentertained by Sister Townsend.In the morning Elder Taylor, thoughvery weak, felt disposed to continue hisjourney. We traveled fourteen miles toGermantown. He was quite sick atnight, and the bilious fever seemed tosettle upon him. I was also very feeble,myself.On the day following, September 1st,being Sunday, Brother Taylor concludedto remain there for the day, and hold ameeting.It was a German settlement. He wished me to speak, and I spoke uponthe first principles of the gospel. Hefollowed me, and spoke until he was ex-hausted.After we returned to the inn where wewere stopping, I was taken with a chilland fever, and had a very bad night.Brother Taylor was also very sick.The following day, September 2d, wasa painful day to my feelings. It wasevident that Brother Taylor had a settledfever upon him, and would not be ableto travel.Father Coltrin was resolved to con-tinue his journey, and, in conversingwith Brother Taylor, he thought it betterfor one sick man to be left than for two,as I was so sick with the chills and feverthat I was not able to render him anyassistance, nor, indeed, to take care of 
 128  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.myself. Under these circumstances,Brother Taylor advised me to continuemy journey with Brother Coltrin, andmake the best of my way to New York.After committing Elder Taylor into the hands of the Lord, though painfulto me, I gave him the parting hand andstarted. I left him in Germantown,Wayne County, Indiana, in the hands ofa merciful God and a kind and benevo-lent family, who promised to do ever-thing in their power to make him com-fortable until his recovery.This they did, though he passed through a severe course of the billious fever and was sick nigh unto death. Through the mercy of God, however,he recovered from his sickness, and con-tinued his journey. We next met in the City of New York.I continued my journey with Father Coltrin, and we reached Cleveland onthe 18th of September. We there tooksteamer for Buffalo, but were three days and a night in a storm before we made the harbor. We landed at midnight, and in doing so we ran into a schooner,and stove it in.From Buffalo I traveled to Albany ina canal boat, and had a stroke of the ague daily.While on my journey, at Albany, I took a stage in the night, and rode tomy father's home in Farmington, on the21st of September.I was glad to meet with my father's family and the other members of the small branch of the Church which ex-isted there upon this occasion, as I foundthem all strong in the faith of the gos-pel, and glad to meet with me.I was still suffering with the ague daily.On the 27th of September, my grand-mother (on my mother's side), Anna  Thompson, died at Avon. She was eighty-four years of age.It was a singular coincidence that she with her husband, Lot Thompson, also Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thomp- son, all of one family, died when they were eighty-four years of age.  I wasnot able to attend my grandmother'sfuneral.On the 4th of October, 1839, my uncle, Adna Hart, died, aged forty-threeyears. I had visited him in his sickness,and preached the gospel to him, and he was believing. I had also been associatedwith him from my youth up.On his death-bed he sent me a requestthat I would preach his funeral sermon.I was having the chills and fever daily at the time, attended with a verysevere cough, so much so, that my fatherthought that I would never leave hishome alive. But when they brought methe request of my dying uncle, and theday came for his burial, I told my fatherto get his horse and buggy ready, for I was going to attend the funeral.He thought I was very reckless in re-gard to my own life, as I had suffered with chills and fever some fifteendays, and to attempt to speak in myweak state, and to begin at the same hour that my chill was to come on,seemed to him foolhardy.My parents were quite alarmed, yetaccording to my request my father got up his team, and I rode with him and my step-mother five miles, through a cold, chilly wind, and I commencedspeaking to a large congregation, at thesame hour that my chill had been in the habit of coming on.I spoke over an hour with great free-dom, and my chill left me from that hour, and I had no more attacks for many days.On the Monday following, October 17th, I felt sufficiently restored to health to continue my journey. I took leave ofmy father and sister, and left for New York, where I arrived on the morningof the 8th of November.I spent two months and seven daysafter my arrival in New York, in travel-ing and preaching in that city, New Jersey and Long Island, a portion of thetime with Parley and Orson Pratt. I had frequent attacks during this time ofthe chills and fever, but I preached al-most daily.On the 13th of December I attended our conference in New York City, with Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder John Taylor arrived in our midst, and itwas a happy meeting.He had passed through a severe siegeof sickness after we parted but throughthe mercy of God had been preserved, and was able to continue his journey.He also informed us that others of theTwelve had suffered a great deal of sick- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  129ness, and that it was with difficulty that they could travel.After spending six days in New York,Elder John Taylor, in company withElder Theodore Turley and myself sailedout of New York Harbor for Liverpool,on board the packet ship Oxford , on the 19th of December, 1839.We took steerage passage, which cost fifteen dollars each. We had storms andrough weather, but most of the windswere favorable for a quick passage.While on the ship, a Methodist min-ister got into a discussion with some Cath- olics who were in the company, and thearguments of the minister ran rathermore into abuse than sound argument.Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-ister that he did not think it was becom-ing in a daughter to find so much fautlwith the mother as they did, for as theMethodists came out of the Catholics, Elder Taylor thought the mother had as much right to enjoy her religion un-molested as the daughter had. That ended the argument.Our company consisted of 109 souls,composed of Americans, English, Scotch,Irish, Welsh and Dutch.We arrived in Liverpool dock on the11th day of January, 1840, having madethe voyage from New York in twenty-three days.On January 13th, 1840, after visiting Mr. George Cannon, the father of Presi-dent George Q. Cannon, and his family,we took cars in the evening, and arrivedin the midst of the Preston branch ofthe Saints, built up in 1837, by EldersHeber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and Willard Richards.We very soon had a pleasant interviewwith Elder Willard Richards, who hadremained in Preston to take care of the Church, while the rest had returnedhome to America.We spent three days at Preston invisiting the Saints, and on the 17th weheld a council at Elder Richards' homein that place.After consulting upon the best coursefor us to pursue, it was finally resolvedthat Elder John Taylor and Joseph  Fielding go to Liverpool, Elder Wood-ruff to Staffordshire Potteries, TheodoreTurley to Birmingham, Elder Richardswherever the Spirit might direct him,and that William Clayton preside overthe branch in Manchester.After various principles of the Chruch had been expounded by the Apostles present, the council adjourned.Elder Willard Richards had beencalled to be one of quorum of the Twelve Apostles, but had not yet re-ceived his ordination.On the day following I parted withElders Taylor and Fielding, who wentto Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley and I went to Manchester.It was the first time I ever visited thatcity. I here first met with Elder Wm.Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-tion to him, he informed me that one of the sisters in that place was possessed of the devil and he asked me to go and cast it out of her, thinking that onethe Twelve Apostles could do anythingin this line he might wish to.However, I went with him to thehouse where the woman lay, in the handsof three men, in a terrible rage, and trying to tear her clothing from her.I also found quite a number of Saintspresent, and some unbelievers, and who hadcome to see the devil cast out and amiracle wrought.If I had acted upon my own judge-ment I should not have attempted to ad-minister to her with the company pres-ent, but as I was a stranger there, andBrother Clayton presided over the branch, I joined him in administering tothe woman. But the unbelief of thewicked present was so great, we couldnot cast the devil out of her, and sheraged worse than ever.I then ordered the room to be cleared,and when the company left the house, except the few attending to her, we laid hands upon her, and I commanded the devil to come out of her, in the name of Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and she was entirely cured and fell asleep.The next day being the Sabbath, she came before a large congregation of peo-ple, and bore testimony to what theLord had done for her. We had a largeassemblage through the day and evening, to whom I preached the gospel.On Monday morning, the devil, notbeing satisfied with being cast out of thewoman, entered into her little child,which was but a few months old. 
 130 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.I was called upon to visit the child.I found it in great distress, writhing inits mother's arms. We laid hands uponit and cast the devil out of it, and the evil spirits had no power over the house-hold afterwards.This was done by the power of God, and not of man. We laid hands upontwenty in Manchester who were sick, and they were mostly healed.On the 21st, I arrived in Burslem bycoach, and met, for the first time, with Elder Alfred Cordon. This being my field of labor, I stopped and commencedwork.Elder Turley stopped in the pottery district some eight days, then went to Birmingham, his field of labor.I received a letter on the 10th of Feb-ruary, from Elder John Taylor, who wasat Liverpool, saying they had commenced there and baptized ten persons.I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Lane End,and several other villages, from the 22d,of January until the 2d of Marchpreaching every night in the week andtwo or three times on the Sabbath.I baptized, confirmed and blessedmany, and we had a good field open for labor. Many were believing, and it ap-peared as though we had a door open to bring many into the Church in that partof the vineyard.March 1st, 1840, was my birthday,when I was thirty-three years of age. Itbeing Sunday, I preached twice throughthe day to a large assembly in the CityHall, in the town of Hanley, and ad-ministered the sacrament unto the Saints.In the evening I again met with a largeassembly of the Saints and strangers, andwhile singing the first hymn the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and the voice of God said to me, "This is the lastmeeting that you will hold with this peo-ple for many days."I was astonished at this, as I hadmany appointments out in that district.When I arose to speak to the people,I told them that it was the last meetingI should hold with them for many days.They were as much astonished as I was.At the close of the meeting fourpersons came forward for baptism, andwe went down into the water and bap-tized them.In the morning I went in secret before the Lord, and asked Him what His will was concerning me.The answer I got was, that I shouldgo to the south, for the Lord had a greatwork for me to perform there, as manysouls were waiting for the word of the Lord.On the 3d of March, 1840, in fulfill-ment of the word of the Lord to me, Itook coach and rode to Wolverhampton,twenty-six miles, and spent the nightthere.On the morning of the 4th I again took coach, and rode through Dudley, Stourbridge, Stourport and Worcester, and then walked a number of miles to Mr. John Benbow's, Hill Farm, CastleFrome, Ledbury, Herefordshire. Thiswas a farming country in the south of England, a region where no Elder of theLatter-day Saints had visited.I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthyfarmer, cultivating three hundred acres of land, occupying a good mansion, andhaving plenty of means. His wife, Jane,had no children.I presented myself to him as a mission-ary from America, an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who had been sent to him by thecommandment of God as a messenger of salvation, to preach the gospel of lifeunto him and his household, and the in-habitants of the land.Mr. Benbow and his wife received mewith glad hearts and thanksgiving. Itwas in the evening when I arrived, hav-ing traveled forty-eight miles by coachand on foot during the day, but afterreceiving refreshments we sat down to-gether, and conversed until two o'clockin the morning.Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoicedgreatly at the glad tidings which I brought unto them of the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which God had re-vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,Joseph Smith, in these last days.I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr. Benbow gave me, that there was a company of men and women--over sixhundred in number--who had broken offfrom the Wesleyan Methodists, and takenthe name of United Brethren. Theyhad forty-five preachers among them,and had chapels and many houses that 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  131were licensed according to the law of theland for preaching.This body of United Brethren weresearching for light and truth, but hadgone as far as they could, and were con-tinually calling upon the Lord to openthe way before them, and send themlight and knowledge that they mightknow the true way to be saved.When I heard these things I couldclearly see why the Lord had command-ed me, while in the town of Hanley, toleave that place of labor and go to thesouth, for in Herefordshire there was a great harvest-field for gathering manySaints into the kingdom of God.I retired to my bed with joy afteroffering my prayers and thanksgiving toGod, and slept sweetly until the risingof the sun.I arose on the morning of the 5th,took breakfast, and told Mr. Benbow Iwould like to commence my Master'sbusiness, by preaching the gospel to thepeople.He had a large hall in his mansionwhich was licensed for preaching, and hesent word through the neighborhoodthat an American missionary wouldpreach at his house that evening.As the time drew nigh many of theneighbors came in, and I preached myfirst gospel sermon in the house. I alsopreached on the following evening at thesame place, and baptized six persons, including Mr. John Benbow and his wife,and four preachers of the United Brethren.I spent most of the following day inclearing out a pool of water, andpreparing it for baptizing in, as I sawmany to be baptized there. I afterwardsbaptized six hundred in that pool ofwater.On Sunday, the 8th, I preached atFrome's Hill in the morning, at Stand- ley Hill in the afternoon, and at JohnBenbow's, Hill Farm, in the evening.The parish church that stood in theneighborhood of Brother Benbow&apos;s, pre-sided over by the rector of the parish,was attended during the day by only fif-teen persons, while I had a large congre-gation, estimated to number a thousand,attend my meeting through the day andevening.When I arose in the evening to speakat Brother Benbow&apos;s house, a man en-tered the door and informed me that hewas a constable, and had been sent bythe rector of the parish with a warrantto arrest me.I asked him "For what crime?"He said, &quot;For preaching to the peo-ple."I told him that I, as well as the rec-tor, had a license for preaching the gos-pel to the people, and that if he wouldtake a chair I would wait upon him aftermeeting.He took my chair and sat beside me.I preached the first principles of theeverlasting gospel for an hour and aquarter. The power of God rested uponme, the Spirit filled the house, and thepeople were convinced.At the close of the meeting I openeda door for baptism, and seven offered themselves. Among the number werefour preachers and the constable.The latter arose and said, &quot;Mr. Wood-ruff, I would like to be baptized."I told him I would like to baptizehim. I went down to the pool and bap-tized the seven. We then met togetherand I confirmed thirteen, and brokebread unto the Saints and we all rejoicedtogether.The constable went to the rector andtold him if he wanted Mr. Woodrufftaken up for preaching the gospel, hemust go himself and serve the writ, for he had heard him preach the only truegospel sermon he had ever listened to inhis life.The rector did not know what to makeof it so he sent two clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meet-ing, and find out what we did preach.But they were both pricked in theirhearts and received the word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and con-firmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.The rector became alarmed and didnot dare to send anybody else.The ministers and rectors of the Southof England called a convention andsent a petition to the Archbishop ofCanterbury, to request parliament topass a law prohibiting the Mormonsfrom preaching in the British dominion.In this petition the rector stated that one "Mormon" missionary had baptizedfifteen hundred persons, mostly membersof the English church, during the lastseven months. 
 132 TULLIDGE'S  QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.But the archbishop and council, know-ing well that the laws of England gavefree toleration to all religions under the British flag, sent word to the petitionersthat if they had the worth of souls atheart as much as they had the groundwhere hares, foxes and hounds ran, theywould not lose so many of their flock.I continued to preach and baptizedaily.On the 21st day of March I baptized Elder Thomas Kingston. He was super-intendent of both preachers and membersof the United Brethren.The first thirty days after my arrival in Herefordshire, I had baptized forty-five preachers and one hundred and sixty members of the United Brethrenwho put into my hands one chapel and forty-five houses, which we licensedaccording to law to preach in.This opened a wide field for labor, and enabled me to bring into theChurch, through the blessings of God, over eighteen hundred souls during eight months, including all of the six hundred United Brethren except one person; alsoincluding some two hundred preachersof various denominations.This field of labor embraced Hereford- shire, Gloucestershire and Worcester- shire, and formed the conference of Gar- way, Gadfield Elm and Frome's Hill.I was visited by President Young and Dr. Richards.Brother Benbow furnished us with£300 to print the first Book of Mor- mon that was published in England: and on the 20th of May, 1840, BrighamYoung, Willard Richards and I held a council on the top of Malvern Hill, and there decided that Brigham Young godirect to Manchester and publish 3,000copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000copies of the Book of Mormon, thisbeing the first publication of these booksin England.The power of God rested upon us and upon the mission.The sick were healed, devils were cast out, and the lame were made to walk.One case I will mention: Mary Pitt,who died in Nauvoo, Geauga County, Illinois|Nauvoo, sister to Wm. Pitt,who died in Salt Lake City, had notwalked upon her feet for eleven years.We carried her into the water and I bap-tized her.On the evening of the 18th of May,1840, at Brother Kingston's house inDymock, Elders Brigham Young, Wil-lard Richards and I laid hands upon her head and confirmed her.Brigham Young, being mouth, re-buked her lameness, and commanded her to arise and walk, in the name of the Lord. The lameness then left her,and she never afterwards used a staff orcrutch.She walked through the town of Dy-mock next day, which created a stiramong the people; but the wicked didnot feel to give God the glory.The whole history of this Hereford-shire mission shows the importance oflistening to the still small voice of theSpirit of God and the revelations of theHoly Ghost.The Lord had a people there preparedfor the gospel. They were preparing forlight and truth, and the Lord sent me to them, and I declared the gospel of lifeand salvation unto them, and someeighteen hundred souls received it, andmany of them have been gathered toZion in these mountains. Many of themhave also been called to officiate in thebishopric, and have done much good inZion. But in all things we shouldever acknowledge the hand of God, andgive Him the honor, praise and glory, forever and ever. Amen.On the 17th of August 1840, I tookthe parting hand of the Saints in Here- fordshire and started on a mission to London, in company with ApostlesHeber C. Kimball and George A.  Smith. We rode from Leigh to Chel- tenham, where we tarried for the night and in the morning took coach and rodeforty miles through a most delightfulcountry, which everywhere wore the golden hue of a plentiful harvest, passedthrough Oxfordshire, in sight of Stowe, the family residence of the Duke ofBuckingham, and at Farmington Station, took train for London where we arrivedat 4 p.m. We changed conveyance to the center of the city by omnibus,walked across London Bridge into theBorough, and called upon Mrs. Allgoodthe sister of Elder Theodore Turley's wife. She treated us with kindness,gave us refreshments and then directed us to a public house, the King's Arms,King Street, Borough. Here we tarriedfor the night. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  133We were now in England&apos;s great met-ropolis to sound to it the first proclama-tion of the Latter-day Work: for Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, and my-self were the three first elders in Londonto preach the Gospel and establish theChurch of Latter-day Saints.We took a walk into the city, passedLondon Bridge twice, and returned andspent the night at the King's Arms.On the following day we called upon the Rev. J. E. Smith, Lin- coln's Inn Fields, also visited John Pye, 16 Curiosity Street, ChanceryLane. He was a strong believer in theprophecies of Joanna Southcott and wasone of the society. We then returned and had a view of St. Paul's Cathedral,the largest in the world except St. Peter'sin Rome. We crossed London Bridge,took tea at 19 King Street, and thenwent to Union Chapel, Waterloo Road, and heard a comical sermon deliveredby an Aitkenite preacher. I spent thenight at 58 King Street at Mrs. Loftus.The next day, August the 21st, wasthe most interesting sight-seeing day inmy life, as far as viewing the splendidworks of man. I started in companyof Elders Heber C. Kimball and GeorgeA. Smith for a walk over the City ofLondon. We crossed London Bridge,passed through King William Street,and several other streets, and visitedCovent Garden; then through St. Mar-tin Street and Court, Leicester Square,Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Pica- dilly, Glass House Street and throughmost of Regent Street,--one of the most splendid streets in the world. Wepassed through Langham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire nakedfrom its base to the top, then throughOxford Street, and returned by way ofSt. Paul's, ending our sight-seeing of theday by visiting the noted monumenterected in commemoration of the greatfire in London in 1666, and built underthe direction of that famous architect,Sir Christopher Wren. We entered adoor at its base, paid six pence on enter-ing, and ascended three hundred andforty-five black marble steps, whichbrought us up two hundred feet into theair and about one hundred feet higherthan the highest houses. We stepped onthe outside of the pillar, which is sur-rounded by an iron railing, and here we had presented to our view an indescrib-able scenery on every hand of the great-est city in the world, which can boast ofa history of nearly two thousand years.At our feet, as it were, lay a historicalpanorama, stretching out to our viewaround.We were situated so as to overlooknearly every part of the city. East ofus lay the ancient Tower of London;east of us also lay the Mint; north theMansion House of the Lord Mayor ofLondon; north-west, St. Paul's Church;west, Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament; south lies the River Thames with five of the large bridgesacross in full view and one not seen fromthe Monument, making six. These sixbridges are fine sights in themselves.They are the architectural monumentsof the Thames, and our view of themfrom our high pinnacle with their crowdsof moving and everchanging humanmasses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages, drays, etc., which dash along, presentedto us a picturesque sight. In additionto all this, within our view, was London Borough, on the south of the river, andall around us hundreds of churches,chapels, and spires, standing in themidst of one universal mass of buildings,covering about six square miles of ground. While viewing this prospect ona clear day, we conversed with a Prussiantraveler, a citizen of Berlin, who hadtraveled much over Europe and Asia andother parts of the world, and he declaredthat we could not find another spot on the face of the earth that would presentto our view so grand a scenery as theone before us.August 23d we went to Zion's chapeland heard the celebrated Rev. Robert Aitken preach two sermons. He de-livered a powerful warning to theGentiles, and presented some of themost sublime truths I ever heard from asectarian priest; but he was buildingwithout the foundation.On the 24th we removed our lodgings to Mr. Robert Merryfields, No. 15Gloucester Row, Grange Road, wherewe obtained a room for all three of us.On the 25th of August we attended ameeting of the Temperance Society, attheir hall, which we engaged, but couldnot have it until the 7th of the nextmonth. Brother Smith made a short 
 134  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.speech. On the following day, westarted out to try to get some doorsopened for preaching. Brother Kimballwent to one part of the city and Brother Smith and myself to another. We calledupon two Baptist ministers and askedone for his chapel. In the evening weattended a Methodist meeting in LongLane.Next day we again went to the Tem- perance Hall, in St. George's Road nearthe Elephant and Castle, and by the re-quest of the committee I addressed themeeting upon the subject of temperance,followed by George A. Smith. We gaveout an appointment to preach the Gos-pel at that place September 7th.The day after, we all started out to gothrough the city of London to see if wecould find a man with the Spirit of God,and after wandering through the city,not knowing whither we went, we cameupon a man and stopped him and spoketo him. Brother Kimball asked himif he was a preacher? He saidhe was. He seemed to have a goodspirit, and informed us that he had beento America, and had come to Londonfor the purpose of going to South Aus-tralia, but had just buried one child andanother lay at the point of death. Broth-er Kimball told him his child shouldlive. He gave us some informationwhere we could preach. On the sameday we called upon him and found hischild better, but he was not at home.We then went and heard a Calvinistpreach, and he gave us an invitation tocall and see him.Next day we again went over the cityto see if we could find any of the chil- dren of God. We found one man and his household who received our testi-mony, and he opened his doors for us topreach. We appointed a meeting at hishouse for Sunday evening. His namewas Corner, and he lived at 52 Iron-monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near the church.We had spent twelve days in going toand fro through London, trying to finda people willing to receive our testi-mony, but finding the doors shut againstus, we determined in the name of Godto go into the streets and lift up our voices.Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith,and myself started out on Sunday morn-ing, August the 30th, walked three milesand stopped in Tabernacle Square, Old Street, where we found an Aitkenitepreaching to the people, who was fol-lowed by a Presbyterian. Just as thelatter was about to begin, Elder Kimballinformed him that there was a preacherfrom America present who would like tospeak when he got through. The preacherthen informed the people that there wasan American minister present, and pro-posed that he should speak first. ElderGeorge A. Smith then got into the chair,and spoke about twenty minutes, andthen the Presbyterian spoke. George A.had informed the people that there weretwo other American preachers presentwho would like to address them, and,when the Presbyterian closed, ElderKimball asked him if there would be anyobjection to our preaching there at threeo'clock. He answered, "No, not at all.What denomination do you belong to?""To the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- ter-day Saints," was the reply."Oh, I have heard of them," he said. "They are a bad people; they have donemuch hurt; they divide churches; wedon't want to hear you."He then mounted the chair again andsaid to the people, "I have just heardthat the last man who spoke belongs tothe Latter-day Saints," and he began torail against us.Elder Kimball asked him to let himstep into the chair to give out an ap-pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, buthe would not let him. Brother Kimballthen raised his voice and informed thepeople that some American preacherswould preach there at 3 o'clock.At the appointed time we were at the place. The conduct of the preacher andthe excitement upon the subject broughta large congregation to hear us. Iopened the meeting by singing andprayer and spoke about twenty minutes,from Gal. I. 8-9 v., and was followed byElder Kimball for about the same lengthof time. The people gave good attentionand seemed to be much interested inwhat they heard.After meeting, Mr. Corner invited ushome; but soon after we arrived at hishouse, Elder Kimball felt impressed toreturn to the place of preaching. Whenhe got there he found a large companytalking about the things which they had 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  135heard, and they wished him to speak tothem again. He did so and addressedthem at considerable length, and after-ward several invited him home to theirhouses.While he was away a man who had been a preacher came to Mr. Corner's;I gave him a brief account of the greatwork of God in the last days and theyreceived the things which I spake untothem. Mr. Corner offered himself forbaptism. This was the first man in thecity of London who offered himself forthe ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-pointed the next evening to administerthe ordinance of baptism unto him.After supping with him we returnedhome. I was weary and unwell duringthe night, but felt thankful unto theLord for the privilege of preaching tothe inhabitants of this great city and tohave gained one soul as a seal to ourministry.On the 31st of August we reaped thefirst fruits of our labors and laid the firstliving stone of the Church of Jesus Christin England's great metropolis.We walked into the city and calledupon Mr. Corner, who went forwardwith us to the public baths and receivedthe initatory ordinance of the Gospel. He was baptized by Brother Kimball.Returning to the house of BrotherCorner, Elders Kimball, Smith and my-self laid our hands upon his head andconfirmed him a member of the Church.We returned to our homes that night,thankful unto God for his goodness inblessing our labors even thus much.On the 2d of September I was quiteill. I had been unwell for several days,but now I was obliged to keep to meroom; but Elders Kimball and Smithwent into the city to visit the people andfound some who hearkened to them favor-ably. We had by this time found thatLondon was the hardest place for a mis-sion that we had ever undertaken, butwe did not feel discouraged in the least,and were determined in the name of theLord to set up the standard of the King-dom in that city.The following day I was still confinedto my room most of the time, but onthe next, Elders Kimball and Smith wentto Debtford, and I took a walk into thecity, called upon Brother Corner andfound him in good spirits. I also calledupon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,Basin, who was a director of a Methodistchapel. I asked him for the chapel topreach in. He said he had a schoolhouse which would hold two hundred,and that I might have that on Sunday.So I gave out an appointment at BowlCourt, 137 Shordeitch. I conversedwith several others who received my tes-timony, and one woman said she wouldbe baptized.Sunday, September the 6th, I preachedin the morning at Bowl Court, 137Shoreditch, and was followed by EldersKimball and Smith. We also held ameeting in Tabernacle Square, at 3o'clock in the afternoon, at which EldersKimball and Smith preached and I boremy testimony to their words. One manarose and opposed us, and was angry be-cause of the truth of God. He continuedopposing, until the police stopped theconversation.We met again in the evening at BowlCourt, to preach to the people, but when we got there we found a plan con-trived by several of the preachers forone of them to preach, lest some shouldbelieve our testimony. We went ourway and found four persons who re-ceived our testimony and offered them-selves for baptism.Next day I wrote to Elder Browett ofmy Herefordshire field of labor, andwalked to Brother Corner's and visitedseveral other friends. Two offered them-selves for baptism. I visited St. Paul'sand then returned home. Elders Kim-ball and Smith had just returned from avisit to the Rev. Robert Aitken. He received them kindly, acknowledgedtheir doctrine true, but was afraid ofdeception. His mind was in a disturbedstate.In the evening we held a meeting inthe Temperance Hall; but we had al-most the bare walls to preach to, therebeing only about thirty present. Ipreached to the few present for about anhour, and Elder Kimball followed me.After paying seven shillings and sixpence for the use of the hall we returnedto our lodgings.On September the 9th I paid my bills and called upon the friends,, in companyof Brothers Kimball and Smith, and onthe day following I parted from the 
 136 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.brethren and friends in London to re-turn to Herfordshire.We had spent twenty-three days inthat great Babylon of modern times andhad found it harder to establish theChurch there than in any place wherewe had ever been. We had baptizedone man, and ordained him a priest; and six others had given in their namesto be baptized on the following Sunday;and at this time there was some littleprospect of the Rev. Robert Aitken re-ceiving the work. I, therefore, leftLondon feeling that our mission and labors had not been altogether in vain.I was rejoiced on my return to thechurches to find that the work was uni-versally and rapidly progressing in Here-fordshire. In some cases it was evenreaching the nobility, and a lady oftitle had become convinced of the work of God through our ministry.Lady Roberts was of the nobility ofEngland and a lady of wealth, and hadwithdrawn from the Church of Englandand had traveled much in search of truthlooking for the fulfillment of the Pro-phets.She became acquainted with the ful- ness of the Gospel through a femaleservant in the employ of Squire Dowds- well. She began to investigate the sub-ject; the Spirit of God rested upon herand convinced her of the truth of thework. She obtained the four numberspublished of the Millennial Star, and,fearing that she should not be able toobtain them for herself, copied thewhole of them with her pen. She alsoread the Book of Mormon and copied a part of that, and became perfectly con-vinced of the truth of the work ofwhich she read, and said she would go athousand miles but what she would seesome of the Twelve and be baptized under their hands. Hearing that I wasin London she was about to take a journey there to see me, and the otherbrethren, and be baptized. She had two brothers, ministers of the Church ofEngland.On the 21st of September, 1840, weheld the Frome's Hill Conference, atwhich were represented 24 churches,with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,9 teachers and 1 deacon. The BranGreen and Frome's Hill Conferenceswere now composed of 40 churches,1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests,15 teachers and one deacon.These two conferences, with theirforty branch churches, and over a thou-sand organized members, under the di-rection of one hundred and thirteenordained officers, had been raised upwithin six months and a half. Surelythe work of God had been marvelous,unparalleled perhaps in the history ofany new religious movement.I meditated upon these things, and inmy journal of date September 21st,1840, I wrote thus:"This has been a busy day with me. After standing upon my feet from morn-ing till evening I am called to shakehands with hundreds of Saints with gladhearts and cheerful countenances. It iswith no ordinary feelings that I meditateupon the cheering fact that a thousandsouls have been baptized into the new and everlasting covenant in about half a year in one field which God has enabledme to open. I pray him to accept thegratitude of my heart for his merciesand blessings unto me in this thing, andenable me to stand with these Saintsand all the righteous in His celestial kingdom."This day I had stood upon my feet eight hours in conference, conversedmuch of the time in suggesting, speak-ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about thirty, confirmed some, healed manywho were sick, shook hands with aboutfour hundred Saints, walked two miles,and ended with about four hours chim-ney corner preaching. I then laid downto rest and dreamt of catching fish.The church ministers at this time werevery much stirred up in this region be-cause of the success of the work of Godin the midst of the people, and every exertion was made by them to stay itsprogress. They were finding that theLord was delivering their flocks out oftheir hands and giving them unto theshepherds of the Church of the Saints.They were alarmed and were holdingconventions and meetings to contriveplans and adopt means to overthrow the latter-day work of God, which they un-derstood not, and believed not, yetfeared its power. And well indeed theymight, for in some instances they didnot have more than ten or fifteen at their

Great solemnitypervaded the congregation. The Spirit of God was moving the people and theyfelt that the Lord was doing a work intheir midst.[TO BE CONTINUED]

Greenlow with the Rigdon party laid a plot in pitsburgh to secretly stere[o]type that work & come to London & Enter the work & steal it out of our hands but the God of Heaven who revealed secrets made this known to me in time put it & leave the work before them which gives us the privleges ofprinting it & sending it to two hundred Million of people in England Scotland Ireland Wales canida all the East Indes& all the world whare Brittania sweeps her scepter.

 John, that, under the circumstances which the Church isin, it should not be called upon to give you furtherassistance. You are at liberty, and have the oppor-tunity of doing something for yourself, and with thisamount given you by the Church, you ought, with goodmanagement, to be able to keep out of debt. It is notpleasant for me to have to decline an application such as you make; but the calls upon the Churchare so numerous in every direction that we are compelledto exercise great care in the disbursement of the funds.You probably can make arrangements with someof your friends to assist you in tiding over this pinchtill the next quarter.With kind regards,Your Brother,W Woodruff

BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. March 9th 1888.Elder Joseph F. Smith,Washington, D. C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:We have just received a very inter-esting communication, under date of the 3rd inst., fromBrother John T. Caine. In speaking of the Amend-ment to the Federal Constitution, which is very likely tocome up before the House, he is desirous to know ourviews concerning his action upon that question. Mr. Gibson, it seems, suggested to him in the first placethat he should remain neutral. Brother Caine says,however, that he has very decided views upon thesubject, and he has outlined a speech that he mightmake upon the question that, he thinks, would be 
 considerable certainty as to the merits of the two linesand to decide which, under the circumstances, is thebetter line for the Saints to come by.Respecting the newspapers of whichyou make mention, and from which you send usextracts, you will be better able to decide afterseeing Maude, who can give you the informationnecessary concerning them and the power of our friends to reach them. His presence in Washingtonwill enable you to understand the situation muchbetter than it would be possible to learn by letteror by telegram, as he can give you a knowledgeof the influences which are at work and the abilityof our friends to reach papers and persons that maybe necessary to make our business successful. I trust you have been able to see him and thatyour interviews have been satisfactory. We received a dispatch from him after he reached Washington,in which he informed us that he had not yetmet with you.
