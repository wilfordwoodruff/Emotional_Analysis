 1 The following is a copy of the Testimony of the Apostle   Wilford Woodruff to be published to the whole world  St George Temple Feb 22 1879      To the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints   throughout Zion and throughout the world Greeting  I feel desireous to once more while in the flesh, By the   word of God and Testimony of Jesus Christ to bear my  testimony unto you as the Church and Kingdom of God   Esstablished on the Earth By the God of Heaven in this   last dispensation and fullness of times. I also wish to bear   my testimony to all Nations under heavens Emperors   Kings, Presidents, Statesmen, Govornors, Judges, all   Rulers and the Rulled, Jew and Gentile who dwell upon   the face of the whole Earth My Testimony is this unto   all Men and Nations. That you live in the day and hour   of the Judgments of God Almighty. You live in the day   and generation when the God of Israel has set his hand   to perform his work his strange work in the Latter days  Yoy live in the age in which God will bring to pass the   fulfillment of that flood of Prophesy and Revelation   which has been spoken by all the Prophets since the world  began, which stands recorded in the Sacred Books of   Divine truth, And the fullfillment of those Revelations  will involve the Destiny of the whole world Jew and Gentile   Rich and poor, High and low, saint and sinner Babylon and   Zion. Therefore prepare yourselves O ye inhabitants of   the Earth for the hour of Gods Judgments is at the door  As it was in the days of Noah and Lot so shall it be   in the days of the coming of the Son of man. [##Matthew 24:37##] First to  the Saints of God who have Entered into covenant with     
 2   the Lord and have been ordained unto the Holy   Priesthood. if you are living your religion and   Enjoying the spirit of inspiration which is your Duty  you know as God Lives, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of   God, that He received the Administration of Angels, that He   brought forth the Book of Mormon and translated it By   the power of God. you know He received the fulness of   the Everlasting Gospel, and the Holy Priesthood, and   Apostleship, and the Keys there off, and He organized   the Church of Christ the ownly true and living Church  upon the face of the whole Earth with its gifts and graces  thereoff with which the Lord is well pleased; you  also know Joseph Smith the Prophet left his testiment   upon the Earth, and sealed that testiment with his   own life and Blood, and that testiment is in force   upon all the world. And that Testiment is filled with   the Revelations of God that stands upon its pages   like flames of Living fire, ready to be fulfilled upon   all the inhabitants of the Earth. In this testiment the   Lord has commanded his servants to go to all the world   and Preach this gospel of the Kingdom to Every creature   as far as doors can be opened. He has also commanded   his servants to visit New York, Albany, & Boston, and   all the Notible cities and villages of the world, and   reproving them of their ungodly deeds and warning them  of the Desolation and utter abolishment which awaits   them if they reject the servants of God or their testimony  for with you saith the Lord Almighty I will rend     
 3  their Kingdoms. I will shake not ownly the Earth but   the starry Heaven shall tremble you cannot see it now   but soon you shall see it and know that I an God  ye Latter Day Saints do ye not know these things are   true. You do, and so do I, for the spirit of God bears   Record, and the record is truth, and truth abideth forever  under these circumstances what manner of men and women ought   we to be [##3 Nephi 27:27##] are we prepared as a people for thesse great Events which  await us as a people. Judge Ye, what is our duty as saints of   the Living God. It is our duty to humble ourselves befor the   Lord and call upon his name untill we are filled with the   Holy Ghost and the spirit of Inspiration, walk in the   Light of Christ, Pay our Tigesthes and offerings, keep the  commandments of God, and have faith in his word, remem-  ber and honor our covenants, obligations, and ordinan-  ces we hav Entered into in the Holy Places and Temples of our   God. We should unite ourselves together in a temporal   as well as spiritual point of view, as directed by the   wise men of Israel. We should seek to build up the kingdom  of God and Zion and not alone ourselves. When we do   thiese theings then we are prepared as a people to let   our Prayers ascend into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth from  one End of Heaven to the other, and they will be heard and   answered upon our heads. Again this Testiment which   Joseph Smith has left contains a Revelation and Commandment   from God out of Heaven concerning the Patriarchal   order of Marriage. The Lord has commanded us to have ^our^ wives   and children sealed to us for time and Eternity that we may     
 4  have them with us in our family organization in   the Resurrection to dwell with us forever in the Eternal   worlds that we may have an increas of posterity forever  in connextion with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all   the Ancient Patriarch's And God Our Heavenly Father   Knowing that this was the ownly Law ordained by   the Gods o[f] Eternity that would Exhalt Immortal   Beings to Kingdoms, Thrones, Principalities, Powers and   dominions and heirs of God, and Joint heirs of Jesus   Christ to a fulness of Celestial Glory. I say the God of   Israel knowing these things commanded Joseph Smith  the Prophet and the Latter Day Saints to obey this   Law or you shall be damned Saith the Lord. Now   after obeying this law for many years. The Congress of   the United States, and the Supreme Judges of the   Nation theyn stand forth and say you shall be   damned if you do obey it. Now Ye Latter Day Saints  what are you going to do under these circumstances  God says we shall be damned of we do not obey   the Law, Congress says we shall be damned if we do.  It places us precisely in the same position that it   did the Hebrews in the firey furnice [##Daniel 3##], or Daniel in the   Den of Lions [##Daniel 6##}. The Enemies of Daniel counciled together  and said we cannot find any occasion against this   Daniel except we find it against him concerning the Law   of his God. Our Enemies have persued the same cource   and the Law makers and Judges have Joined with   them, and made it a Law of Offence to obey one of the     
 5  Laws of Our god Now who shall we obey God or   Man. My voice is we shall obey God, we have but   a short time to live here we have a long Eternity to live  on the other side of the Veil. This position takes the   Matter ouentirely out of our hands, the warefare now is   between God and the Nation. I am an American   Citizen I was born and raised in the State of Connecticut  I wish to Ask the Law Makers and Judges a few   questions. By what power was Columbus inspired to   plead before the courts of Europe to assist him to fit out  a fleet to cross the ocean, to find a western continent  By what power was He protected untill He accomplished  this. By what Power was our forefathers inspired to cross  the ocean to inherit this land, and when they had inher-  ited the land, and the yoak of bondage laid upon their necks  by their Mother Country to grieveious to be bourrn they   rose up as a Nation and Declaired there independance  and passed through an Eight years war at the Expens  of much Blood and treasure, and finally maintained   their Independance and Esstablished a free and   Independant Government which was acknowledged   by the Nations of the Earth. By what power was the   Constitution of the United States inspired formed   framed, and Adopted as the Supreme Law of the Land   to be handed down as a rich Legacy to their posterity   from Generation to Generation All these Blessings have   been obtained by the Inspiration of Almighty God, and   the will of heaven. This glorious instrument     
 7  from the consequences thereof a, And all Rulers of  this Nation as well as other Nations will have to   give an account to the Judge of all the Earth for the  Use they make of the power put into their hands  Virtue Exhalteth a Nation while sin is a reproach to  any People. The question was asked the Hebrews   what God is there that is able to deliver you out of the  Hands of King Nebuchadnezzar A righteous answer  of faith was given. We do not know that our God will   deliver us out of your hands, But be it known unto the  O King that we will not serve thy Gods, men worship the golden  Image which thou hast set up. [##Daniel 3:15-18##] So I say as an Apostle   of the Lord Jesus Christ I will not desert my wifves  and my children, and Disobey the commandments of  God, for the sake of accomidating the public clammers of  a generation steeped in sin and Ripened for the Damnation  of Hell I would rathr go to prision and to Death * ^see page^ 13      I wish in this testimony to say to the Jews to the Rothchilds, to Diserilla  and all rich Jews take your gold, and your silver from the hands   of the Gentiles and Buy Jerrusalem, and all the Holy land and all  the Land given to Abraham your great Progenitor. Go to and   Rebuild your city Jerrusalem and Temple for your deliverance  is at the door. Gather together your Brethren the Jews from all the   Gentile Nations, for the fullness of the Gentiles has come in   And the Lord has decreed that the Jews shall be gathered from   all the Gentile Nations whether they have been driven into there  own land in fulfillment of the words of Moses your Law-  Giver And this the will of your Great Eloheem And     
 8  whenever you turn your hand to this work the God  of Israel will help you. You have a great future and destiny  before you and you cannot avoid fulfilling it You are   the royal chosen seed and the God of your fathers have   kept you distinct as a Nation for Eighteen hundred   years under all the oppression of the whole Gentile   world. Therefor Arise O Judah and return home  we ask you not to wait untill you believe in Jesus   of Nazareth, but when you meet with Shilo your King  you will know him. Your Destiny is marked is marked   out, you cannot avoid it. It is true that after you return  and gather your Nation home and rebuild your city  and Temple that the Gentiles may gather together their  armies to go against you to Battle for to take a prey  and to take a spoil which they will do for the words of  your Prophets must be fulfilled. But when this affliction  comes the same God that Lead Moses through the wilderness  will deliver you and your Shilo will come and s^t^and   in your midst and will fight your Batteles and you will  Know him. And the affliction of the Jews will have an End  while the destruction of the Gentilesles will be so great that it  will take the whole house of Israel who are gathered about Jerres-  alem seven months to bury the Dead of their Enemies  And the weapons of war will last them seven years   for fuel so they need not go to any forest for wood.       These are Tremendious sayings who can bear then Never-  theless they are true and will be fulfilled according to the  sayings of Ezekiel, Zachariah and other prophets though     
 9  the Heavens and Earth Pass away not one jot or tittle  wasll [will] fall unfulfilled. I would say to the Lamanits   if I could speak to their understanding that you are also  a Branch of the House of Irsrael, and once Belonged to  Pleasant Ephraim, and your forefathers have fallen   through the same Example of unbelief and sin, as have  the Jews, and you areas their posterity have wandered   in sin and darkness for Many Generations, and you  like the Jews have been driven and tramplled under  the feet of the Gentiles, and put to death through your  wars with Each other and with the white man,  untill you are almost annihilated from off the Earth  But there is still a redemption and salvation for a   Remnant of you in the Latter Days. It is time for you to  scease your warefare with each other and sheding each   others Blood, or making war upon your fellow men  cease to shed Blood, learn to cultivate the Earth, and   raise your food from the Earth. Call upon the great spirit  to protect you and deliver you from Bondage and   Darkness, and the Great Spirit will hear you and   deliver you, and a Remnant of you will again become  a Delightsome people as your Forefathers were when  they kept the commandments of God. Could I speak  to the Ten Tribes of Israel in that North Country   I would say call upon the God of your Fathers of   Abraham Isaac & Jacob That your Prophets may   come in Rememberance before God. That they may   hear his voice, And no longer stay themselves but     
 10  smite the rocks that the Mountains of Ice may  flow down at their presence. An high way shall be  cast up in the midst of the Great Deep [##Doctrine and Covenants 133:27##]. Their Enemies   shall become a prey unto them. Bring forth your  Records and Rich treasures unto three children of Ephraim   the servants of the Lord in the Land of Zion, And the  boundaries of the everlasting Hills shall tremble at   your presence, And you shall fall down and be crowned   with Glory Even in Zion by the Hands of the servants  of the Lord Ephr Even the chrilden of Ephraim, And  you shall be filled with Songs of Everlasting Joy  Behold this is the Blessing of the Everlasting God upon  the tribes of Israel, And the richer blessing upon the   head of Ephraim and his fellows. These Events  refered to, are but a vary limited portion of the   Revelations of God which are about to be fulfilled  upon the heads of this Generation. I wish to warn all  Nations of the judgements of God which are at thereir  door. Thrones will be cast down, Nations will be  overturned, Anarchy will reign, all barriers of Law   will be trampled in the dust. You are about to be visited  with war, the sword, famine, pestilence Plague Earthquakes  whirlwinds, tempest and with the flame of Devouring  fire. For By fire and the sword will the Lord plead with  all flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many [##Isaiah 66:16##]. The   sword of the Lord is bathed in heaven and is about to fall [on]   Idumea [##Isaiah 34:5##] or the world for his anger is kindled and the slain   of the Lord will be many and who is able to abide these things     
 11  And who will stand when He appeareth. The fig trees are  leaving, and the signs of all heavens and Earth indicate   the Coming of the Son of Man. The seals are about to be opened,  the plagues to be poured forth, Your river and seas will   be turned to Blood [##Revelation 16:3-4##], and to gaul, and the inhabitants of the Earth  will die of those plagues. And the unbelief of Great Babylon  with the whole Christian world will not make the truths of  God without Effect. Let the world for an example look at   the Ancient Cities of the Nations, whare is Thebes, Tyre,  Sidon, Nineveh, And Babylon the Great which were built  to defy all time and all power but God himself? They were   laid in the dust, and their inhabitants destroyed when they were  ripened in iniquity and that to in fulfillment of the word   of God unto them through the voice of humble men, who spake  as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. In like manner  was Jerrusalem destroyed and the Jews scattered among   the Gentiles in fulfillment of the words of Moses and Jesus  Christ. Will the Lord any more spare the cities of the  Gentiles and Great Babylon than the ancient cities and   the cities of the Jews? No, verrily No. The question may be  asked why are these Judgments coming upon the world   in the last days. I answer because of the wickedness of  the inhabitants thereof. The vary Proclamation of the Angel   of God when He delivered the fulness of the Gospel as recorded   in the Revelations of St John, was "crying with a loud   voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of Gods  Judgment is come". [##Revelation 14:7##] ^and when that proclamation was made to Joseph Smith the prophet it was half a centaury ago^ Light has come into the world and  Men love darkness rather than the light because their deeds are Evil     [##John 3:19-21##] 
 12  The Lord has raised up Prophets And Apostles  who have cryed aloud to this Generation with the proc-  lamation of the gospel for half a centaury and warned   them of the Judgments which were to come, And the  inhabitants of the Earth have rejected this Testimony  and shed the Blood of the Lords Anointed, and persecuted   the Saints of God, And the consequence is that darkness   covers the Earth, and gross darkness the people and the  Lord is withholding his spirit from the inhabitants  of the Earth and the Devil is ruling over his own Kingdom   and sin wickedness and abominations of Every kind   have increased a hundred fold within the last few   years untill the whole Earth is filled with Murder whoredom   Blasphemies and Every crime in the Black catalogue  that was manifest in the Antideluvian world or Sodem   and Gomorrah untill the whole Earth groans under its  abominations, and the Heavens weep and all Eternity  is pained And the Angels are waiting the Great command   to go forth and reap down the Earth. This testimony   I bear to all Nations under Heavens. This is my faith,   my belief, and my opinion. I know they are true by the  inspiration of Almighty God. And the decree of the supreme  court of the United States, bears me out in the opinion that  the Constitution gives me the privilege of Enjoying my   Belief, faith, and opinion in Religion if I do not act.   Therefore the action, and Execution of ^all^ these Tremendious  Events I leave for the God of Heaven to Execute which He most  assuredly will.     
 13  What I have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not   myself And though the Heavens and [Earth] pass away my words  will not pass away [##Matthew 24:35##] but will all be fulfilled saith the Lord of Hosts  I subscribe myself an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ  And a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  The following page was omitted in copy Wilford Woodruff      * If I would not I would never be fit to associate with the prophets  and Patriarchs of old, and I could not But despise in my heart   any man who professed to be a latter day saint who would do  otherwise. Why should ^we^ fear man who ownly has power to   kill the Body more than him who has power to cast both body  and soul into Hell. Christ says when men speak all manners   of Evil against you and persecute you for Righteousness sake  rejoice and be Exceding Glad for so persecuted they the   Prophets and Apostles who were before you [##Matthew 5:11-12##] I would say to  all Israel treat your wives and children Kindly and keep   the Commandments of God and trust in him and He will fight  your battles And I will say in the Name of Jesus Christ   the son of the living God That Mormonism will Live and   prosper, Zion will flourish, And the Kingdom of   God will stand in Power, Glory, and Dominion as David  saw it when this Nation is broaken in peaces as a potters  vessel and laid in the dust and brought to Judgment or  God never spake by my mouth. Therefore I say to all the  Saints throughout the world be faithful and tru to your God  To your religion to your families and to yourselves  Jesus of Nazereth has suffered death on the cross for     
 14 Feb 27, 1879  the redemption of the world And his Apostles followed  his Example for the word of God and the Testimony of Jesus  Christ. And Joseph Smith has proved to the Heaven & Earth  To God Angels and Men that He would abide in his Covenant   Even unto Death And none of us will ever be called to   do any thing more. Any of us would certainly be ashamed   to deny the faith to accomodate our Enemies then meet the  Prophets and Apostles in the spirit world. May God forbid  that this should be the case with any of the Blood of Ephraim      February 27, 1879 ~ Thursday      Feb 27.

Spencer      The Myriads of Dead they often come  A mighty multitude in thought to me  They come from heaven Their lot to try on Earth  They come a brief time past, they died and left  Naught but a record that they had been here  Some Names are mighty, in a worldly sense  And stand forth blazoned by the trump of Fame  While some are noted for the good they did  Their honest upright Philanthropic lives     
 Though many humble have sunk in death  Unto their names has fame lent not a Breath  But they are not forgotten Time has flung  The portals of the world unseen ajar  And those that lived are stepping up and on  To exaltation by the help of Friends  That living in mortality can aid  The dead and gone. The Plan of Life  And of salvation has been wisely laid  That all that will obey may enter in  To joy and to salvation blessed state  For this we gather here as day By day  Rolls on to join Endless Eternity  To work for some Though humble they may be  That they can have their blessings whare they are  For this we gather on thy natal day  To cheer thy heart and Bless the ones that are  Of Kindred to thee, for the work is great  But when all lend a helping hand in time  Thy record will be finished and thy dead Redeemed  we wish the Joy and Peace this day  And all the comforts of this life we live  And all the blessings that our Lord can give  That Blessed in time and in Eternity  Thy soul shall cry Theirs nothing lacked by me  we humbly ask our Father and our God  To ratify these words in heaven above  And give thee all that mortals can receive  In heaven above or while thou still shalt Live  And many days like this mayst thou still see  While we delight to help and honor thee

Islata Numbered 3000, And these Islatas   are a vary strange people compaired with any other American   Indians. They have kept their Blood pure & separate from  all other tribes & People for generations All their women   and girls were virtuous and the most reserved people to   be found on the continent of America. They do not permit   any white men to go into the presence of their wives & daughters  if they can help it. They were so afraid of Br Tenney &  Smith when they went to visit them several year ago   they came near starving before they were permitted to Enter   into their houses But when they proved Br Tenney thoroughly  He was permitted to go any whare among them On our arival   we were vary kindly received By the whole village They   are vary clenly intelligent & Industrious. They are capable   of receiving any principle of Intelligence that any white   man is. They have some women & girls among them as

This old Patriarch gave us a room  facing the public square and furnished us with and fruit   during our stay He said the Americans had called them   wild men He said if they were they were virtuous He   said among them for generations had been Death   to any man who committed adultery, or seduced   a wife or Daughter among them and it was vary   seldom ever Done But when the Americans came they   bring Christian Civilization with them and whordom   & corruption and now if a man was put to death for   seduction the Christian would call it murder and hang us   for it. Their Annual feast comes off tomorrow in their   village Hence People of all the Surrounding country for many   miles are coming into town to day By Every conveyance in   carriages, waggons with Horses, Oxen, Mules, & asses and on foot

The Islatas was  so much above them in their morrals that they retired   to bed about Dark and locked up their houses and let the   Mexicans Do the fighting & gambling. No man woman   or child in Islata is allowed to sweep any dust or dirt   out of their houses into the side walk or street under the penalty   of a fine it all has to be gathered up in baskets & Blankets   and Empted on to Mounds Place appropriated for that purpose  in diferent parts of the village, the mound nearest our   room was 150 yards in circumference & 30 feet high all formed

 Oct 22nd 1879  a living spring we watered our animals then drove over   a rough sand ridge and camped in about a mile of the  Oribe village and took our team to the Oribe well to water  the well stands under the Mountain South west of the  village the well was 670 feet Deep and 100 feet across the  top it was walled up with 4 square tarries of stones and   the water 10 feet across the Bottom a steep trail leading down  from top to Bottom from the last terrace there is 15 stone   stepts to the Bottom when I arived at the well I found an   [FIGURE] Ass or Donkey had walked down to the stone steps  looking down into the water and Braying for some  one to come & watering him his call was louder than   any animal but an ass could make. I took my bucket   and carryed him several Buckets of water which he   drank greedily and when He was satisfied, He bowed   his head as much as to say thank you sir and went off  happy we watered our team returned to the waggon & camped 25 M[iles]      October 23, 1879 ~ Thursday      23 [FIGURE] we drove our waggon and camped at the well of   the Oribes. we were soon surrounded By about 20 Oribes  children from 3 to 18 years of age all the unmarried girls  from 10 years upwards had their hair done up on the side  of the head like a pair of horns or large pair of Ears  which gives them a strange appearance this is a sign  to the young men that they are ready to marry All the  Oribes water their Animals at this well also they  carry water in large Earthern Judgs [jugs] to water the village  which stands 500 feet on the top of the Mountain above  the well. The Oribes & Moquis and all the inhabitants     
 Oct 23 1881 [1879]  of these seven villages raise large fields of corn, beans  mellons & squashes & Peach orchards down on the Earth  below them without Irrigation or water ownly what   falls from heaven which is but vary little and they raise  vary good crops. we find that sand holds moisture  much better in a dry season than clay and soil. we went  on stone stepts & foot paths, some 500 feet to the Oribe village   containing 1000 people with quite a quantity of children.  This village was compackly built of rock laid up in  mortar some four stories high all thes villages are built  On the top of the highest rocks for defence in time of war  This village was about a quarter of a mile around. The   day before our arival they had their great Dance which  kept up untill late at night and the people were rather   stupid. we went on to the top of a four story house  whare we could get a good survey of the surrounding   country. I found the men done the spining and a good  deal of knitting. There was about to be a marriage in   the village and all the men were gathered into the work  shops to spin cotton warp for a pair of Blankets  for the marriage couple, they spun on spindles they held  in their hands and rolled the spindle on their legs   they raised the cotton themselves and when the Blanket  is used the pair sleep under it the first night then laid  away as a sacred garment & never used again until   the man dies then he is buried in it. The men were  in their underground work shops I could not get  then to come out to hear Preaching so I went down     
 Oct 23, 1879  into two of their work shops and spoke to them when   they were at work but found them more interested in  their work than hearing the gospel Preached I spoke to one   company of 20 to another of 30, and Ira Hatch interpeted   it I saw one white Indian called Albinos man vary   white There are some of this clan in nearly all of the   villages. They are milk white much whiter than Amer-  icans whether they are Blood of the Anicient Nephites   or a freek of Nature I cannot say they are not vary   popular among the Indians. After going through the   village and on top of the Houses most of which are   flat on top and covered with Ears of corn to dry from   pure white to jet black, The Black was generally the best  there was read yellow & blue. we then left the village  we then travelled 12 miles over vary rough ground and   camped for the night 5 M[iles]      October 24, 1879 ~ Friday      24 [FIGURES] Moqui village Arizona Br Lot Smith took the   carriage around the bottom and Br Ira Hatch and   myself took the riding horse Button throough theHe was quite  sick with the Distemper we took the Indian trail and   went onto the Mountain to the village of Shemopavy containing   400 Indian stands on the top of a Mountain, the village is   in a compacted form it is 470 yards around the village  we led our horse up the steep trail and stone stepts 500   feet they have to carry all their wood water corn and all   supplies up this stone cliff, they and their forefathers   have lived in this way for Generations for safety in times  of war. The country is vary rough & broaken all around it

We called the people together   and I spoke to them a short time and Brother Hatch interpeted  they were quite Ignorant and difficult to get them to   understand we then left the village descended to the vally   and went to another village 500 feet high on the rocks  called Supowerlou A small village of about 200 souls  we saw one white child a girl much whiter than our   children it was covered with fine white hair it was  one of the Albinos Both Parents were white dark like   the rest of the Indians we called the People together in this   village I spoke a short time to them, we then went 600   Yards to another village called Mashongangbe this   village contains some 800 People, and stands on the   top of the rocks we called them to gether and I spoke   to them and they did not seem capable of comprehending   what was said, they said they could not understand   much There was one boy here with 3/4 of his hair as black  as a coal and 1/4 vary white mixed all through his black   hair, they brought in Melons and blue indiam  Meal Bread as thin as wafer the Mellons were more like  squashes than Mellons, they Eat them green One vary   remarkable feature of that people was the great amount of children  they far out numbered the grown children people we left   this people and descended 500 feet to the valley below  it was the steepest place I Ever lead a horse down. I sent a   Note to Lot Smith by the chief of the place. An aged man I infor-  med Br Smith that we should cross the valley to the 3 last villages  around on the East side Brother Hatch and myself crossed     
 Oct 24, 1879  the valley 7 miles to the three last villages standing on a barren   Rock some 1500 feet from the valley beneath these rocks stand  almost perpendicular These villages can ownly be approached   in two places one on the East side & one on the west by a vary   steep Narrow winding trail and stone stepts the country   bordering upon the foot of this mountain is composed of ridges  & gorges with Peach orchards standing on the sides of the   steep hills and in the vallies But invariably Planted in the sand  the name of thes three villages are Hano or Tewa on the North   300 people 200 yard South stands Cheekumovo 100 people  On the South End of the rock stands Walpe, 800 people.  [FIGURE] sheep 1000 feet On the East side of this rock there is  a projection 200 yards long 12 feet wide   with a trail to it and at night the Moquis   drive their sheep & goats into it for safety  from an Enemy there is a frail stone wall   built on the out Edge to keep the sheep & goats from falling off it   is ownly 2 feet high, the projection is 200 feet from the top of the rocks   and from the pan to the ground 1000 feet, so if a goat or sh^e^ep got   crouded off they do not strike ground for 1000 feet which spoils  them Either for wool or Mutton. These villiages stand upon   a desolate Barren coars sand stone rock abot a mile in length  from 100 yards to 12 feet wide, about 1500 feet perpendicular there   is not a spoonful of Earth or drop of water upon it ownly   what is brought up on the Backs of Man & women. A trail is  made several inches Deep in the solid rock with bear   feet and Moccasin in going from one village to another for   many Generations when we came to the foot of this trail     
 Oct 24 1881 [1879]  it was near sunset, we watered our horse by leading him  down a 30 foot wall vary steep we then had to asscend   this steep trail to get to the top of the rock in order to get our   Horse up with us Br Hatch took the Bridle to lead & I Behind to   drive in several places we had to go 20 or 30 stone steps at   a time like going up a pair of stairs it was with great diff-  iculty that our hors or ourselves got up all being weary  with our days work we saw many women carrying   water in Judges [jugs] rolled in Blankets straped across their   heads we arived at the top of the rock at Dark all tiered   out we called at the first village Hano I found here   the chief of the village Cachaby The father of Polakki   that I became acquainted with at Moan Coppy   Brother Lot Smith was camped by a spring in a peach   orchard on the East Side of the rock And as I was to   weary to go down to him having climbed 3000 feet &   travelled 10 miles during the day and visited several villiages  I proposed to Br Hatch to take the Horse & descend the East side   of the Mountain to Lot Smith camp and leave me with the   Moquis for the night. The Chief brought me a green Mell[on]   half squash to eat. I eat vary little of it He then walked   with me to the Middle village I there found a man by the name   Misiamtoi He was called Si for short He could talk   fair English but Better spanish I was vary glad to meet   with him, as I could convers with him without   an interpeter, and I concluded to stay with him for the   night And quite a number gathered into his house   to see me and hear me talk vary soon Si's wife had     
 Oct 24 1881 [1879]  her supper cooked and I was asked to Eat with them   which I attempted to do but it was hard work. I could   not tell what I was Eating for they were on the filthy order  of cooking & Eating. I Eat some however but the food   was vary unpalatable. Soon Brother Hatch returned   and Brought me a custard pie and Baked chicken which   I relished much. He also brought me blankets to sleep  on and staid & slept with me over night After I got   supper I talked to the people of the who had gathered and   Br Hatch interpeted. There was to be a dance of the young   People of the South village and Si, Br Hatch & myself went   to see it, but it did not Begin untill 9 oclok we saw them   perform one dance some 20 young men and half a   dozen young women with their hair horns on each side  of their [head]. They danced with great animation keeping  stept with the music & sin[g]ing The girls seemed vary   shy and modest we returned to our rooms and bed   which closed the labors of this vary interesting day, having   visited six Indian villages & spoken in most of   them, travelled 10 miles besides climing up 3000 feet of   Mountain stepts I felt weary but well satisfied with the days labor 10 M[iles]      October 25, 1879 ~ Saturday      Oct 25 I arose in the morning rather weary as I lay on   the rock floor with but little under me and I did not sleep  much I steped out of Doors and saw a long row of old   men wraped in their Blankets sitting on the Edge of the rock  to see the sun rise as they were sun worshipers I took a   walk to the North End of the rock or sink whare the trail   comes up I looked down 1500 feet on to the Earth below me     
 Oct 25 1879  I there saw Br Lot Smith making his way up the steep   serpentine trail to meet with me. I saw many women   going down the trail with Judges [Jugs] on their back for water   from the well. I also saw many Dunkies coming up the trail   climing the stone stepts with a sack of Ears of corn on their backs  to the village followed by an indian driver All the corn, beans   Mellons, squashes, wood & water had to be brought up this step   trail of 1500 feet on the backs of Asses, Man, & women which   is an immens amount of Labor All thes seven villages  are built of rock laid in Mortar from one to four stories high  were built by their forefathers many hundreds of years   ago were built and ociupied for many generations to   be secure against their Enemies the Navajoe & others for   40 Men with rocks & stones could keep Napoleens army  from reaching them as ownly one man could come up   at the a time I stood on the top of Black of stone 10 x 20 feet   on top stand on End, hundreds of feet deep with crevices  beteen the Black from 1 to 3 feet wide.

One Chief fell of & several children   at different times in time of war 3 Navajoes was shoved off by the   Moqois they came to talke of peace but got in a Dispute and were

 Franklin Idaho. Jan. 23, /89.    Prest. W. Woodruff.  Salt Lake City    Dear Bro: --    Elder E. R. Lawrence, of Preston, (this  stake) is very desirous of making a visit to  Alabama, this winter, with a view to ob-  taining some information concerning his  relatives, and in a general way, visit his  people and do all the good he can among them  and wishes to carry with him the appoint-  ment of a Traveling Elder, so that he may  feel free to preach and administer in the  ordinances of the Gospel. Were it not for his  poor health, he says he would like a mission  but as it is he does not think he will be able  to remain away from home longer than a  few months. He is able to defray the  expenses of the trip, though would like the  advantage of missionary fare if possible.    If you think it adviseable to grant Bro.  Lawrence's request, will you kindly write him  to that effect giving him what instructions you  may deem proper in your pleasure? He would  like to start in about two weeks.    Resptly, Your  Bro. in the Gospel.    Geo. C. Parkinson

We got along well considering all   things. my wife however is a bed this morning tired out and   most sick it is tedious journeying with Children. I have a   few questions I wish to ask, and a request or two to make. Br Jones  holds in his hands an order from you on me for $500   five hundred Dollars which is to be credited to the Temple. shall  any of the Emigration money, Book money, ^or^ printing money, be  paid on that order, or ownly the money donated for the   temple. An order or letter was put into my hands from  some person in Nauvoo calling for £25 twenty five   pounds from Mr Jeffreys As as I did not hear you speak  of that, I wish to ask if that is all right.

 I have made Enquiry among the Saints as I came along about   furnishing the teams with a load of sumthing for the Temple  wheat seemed to be about the ownly thing that their was a   prospect of getting and that generally was not thrashed, a number   spoke of driving Beef cattle. I told them it would be acept-  able. I spent the night with Br. Simpson B. Huffaker one mile for  south of Green field he says he has about 400 bushels of wheat   he will turn into the Temple. Israel Huffaker has about 150  bushels, & Br Collins about 50 bushels, making about six hundred   bushels of wheat in that Neighborhood, but it is 150 miles from   Nauvoo. now by carrying it 18 miles they can get 5005 per  build for it, now shall they sell it & get money for it & [send]   or carry you the money, or can their be a Steem boat  sent for it which can go within 30 miles, or will it be   wisdom to convey it so far by land. they will get a mashine   and thrash it before long would it not be well to write  Br Huffaker a letter upon the subject, & tel him what you   wish him to do about it. it will be vary expesive carrying  it so far by land. for further particulars enquire of Br  Williams.    The two Laws Wm & Wilson have  followed us or been on the road either before or behind us for the  last hundred miles. they came into Chicago a few minutes  behingd behind us. what their object is I have not yet fully known  they are in town this morning. they have visited the churches & sants   through the country trying to sell their land & property   in Nauvoo for money, cattle or exchange for land in the county   they had about succeeded in making a traid of this kind with   the Saints in Toulon Ill untill we came along I put a   veto upon it & broke it up & am going to do it evry whae I go   for they are ownly trying to gull the Saints for they will loose 
 all they trade with them in this way for their is more mort-  gages and attachments upon their property in Nauvoo than the value  of them. I do not know but their object in comeing here is to take   boat to the Eastene State or Canidas to practice the same fraud  would it not be well to cauth^i^on all the Churches through the   Neighbor & times & Season to beware of having any deal with them   or the Fosters or Higbys. I should think any Saint ought to know  better than to deal with them. I should not think strange if the  Laws were calculating to go to Canida to live. I think of   cautioning the Saints in the East against dealing with those   men, by a note in the prophet upon the subject, unless I am   councilled otherwise for they are going about seeking whome  they may devour. I had but a few moments to write   before the brethen started but I thought I would write   a few lines. We cannot get a boat for Buffalo untill   monday Morning it is now Saturday Morning unless we take   a propeller to Oswego, this evening. My Respects to the quorum   and all who inquire.

O brother Woodruff never can or  should we forget the scenes we then passed through  Whevever I see or hear of a brothr who was with us in that  Camp I feel a thrill of interest swell my bosom that  cannot be expressed in our imperfect lannguage. I rejoice  in those who have stood faithful, and hope, strongly hope  that our heavenly Father will feel after them and  genlty draw them back again to rally round the stand  and of truth bending in humble submission to the Order  of the Kingdom. I see by observation (and I thank God not by  by experience) that it is a small thing or curcumstance that  first cawses or draws away our eye from the mark but how  however small still it is a deviation and who knows how   far it will not lead. I want you to remember me before  the Lord that I may not have temptations stronger than I  can bear. All is well at Nauvoo first rate, and I feel  as through it was well with you.

Governer Ford will have  to give us protection during his administration or  he wil loose his influence with the General Govern  ment, to whome he will be looking for an appoint  ment in the cabinet after he has left the executive  chair in Illinois, and will lose^oose^ it if he is not  our friend.

 St George December 15th 1876.    Jacob Hamblin    Dear Brother:    As you pass from this   city to the Colorado south look out as good a track   for a wagon road as you will have time to do without   stopping to go the right or the left. You are to so well ac-  quainted with the country that you can be of some   use to bro. Pierce who is building a ferry boat at the   Colorado for crossing people; and make him acqainted   with the initial points which will be beneficial to him   for locating a wagon road. Then proceed south ^Easterly^ near ^to^ the   west end of the Sanfrancisco mountains to what is called the   Beal road; thence easterly to what is called sunset crossing   on the Little Colorado river. Make minutes as near as your   Judgement will admit, of distances between different points of   water and feed in your travels. Draw a little map from day to   day.    When you return home to Kanab we would like you   to take your stock and such ones of your family and friends   as you would like to have with you and locate, and take   possession of a litte^l^e place called "Surprise Valley," near 
 near the Colorado river, and report to us your success.    We feel to caution you against those Mexican robbers   that infest the country where you are going. Be always ready   for them and Keep your little Company together    We pray the Lord our father in heaven to bless you   and give you sucess in your mission and return you   in safety    Brigham Young  Wilford Woodruff  Erastus Snow  Brigham Young, Jn.

 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  121    AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.    CHAPTER II.    ORDAINED TO THE APOSTLESHIP--MY MIS-  SION TO ENGLAND.    Joseph Smith, the Prophet, asked the  Lord what His will was concerning the   Twelve, and the Lord answered in a   revelation, given July 8th, 1838, in which  He says: "Let them take leave of my  Saints in the city Far West, on the 26th  day of April next, on the building spot  of my house, saith the Lord.  Let my   servant  John Taylor, and also my ser-  vant John E. Page, and also my servant   Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant  Willard Richards, be appointed to fill  the places of those who have fallen, and  be officially notified of their appoint-  ment."    It will be observed that this differs  from nearly all other revelatios in this  respect: a fixed day and a stated place  were given for the commencement of  the mission.  When the revelation was   given, all was peace and quietude in Far  West, Missouri, the city where most of  the Latter-day Saints dwelt; but before  the time came for its fulifillment, the  Saints of God had been driven out of   the State of Missouri into the State of  Illinois, under the edict of Governor  Boggs; and the Missourians had sworn  that if all the other revelations of Joseph  Smith were fulfilled, that should not be.  It stated the day and the place where the  Twelve Apostles should take leave of the   Saints, to go on their missions across the  great waters, and the mobocrats of Mis-  souri had declared that they would see  that it should not be fulfilled.    It seemed as though the Lord, having  a foreknowledge of what would take  place, had given the revelation in this   manner to see whether the Apostles  would obey it at the risk of their lives.    When the time drew near for the ful-  fillment of this commandment of the  Lord, Brigham Young was the President  of the Twelve Apostles; Thomas B.  Marsh, who was the senior Apostle, had  fallen.  Brother Brigham called together  those of the Twelve who were then at   Quincy, Illinois, to see what their minds  would be about going to Far West, to fulfill  the revelation. The Prophet Jos-  eph and his brother Hyrum, Sidney Rig- don, Lyman Wight and Parley P. Pratt  were in prison in Missouri at the time;   but Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch,   was at Quincy, Illinois.  He and others  who were present did not think it wis-  dom for us to attempt the journey, as   our lives would be in great jeopardy.   They thought the Lord would take the   will for the deed.   But when President   Young asked the Twelve what our feel-  ings were upon the subject, we all of us,   as the voice of one man, said the Lord  God had spoken, and it was for us to  obey. It was the Lord's business to take  care of His servants, and we would ful-  fill the commandment, or die trying.    To fully understand the risk the   Twelve ran in making this journey, my  readers should remember that Lilburn  W. Boggs, governor of the State of Mis-  souri, had issued a proclamation, in   which all the Latter-day Saints were re-  quired to leave that State or be exter- minated. Far West had been captured  by the militia, who were really only an   organized mob; the citizens had been   compelled to give up their arms; all the  leading men who could be got hold of  had been taken prisoners; the rest of  the Saints--men, women and children--  had to flee as best they could out of the  State to save their lives, leaving all their  houses, lands and other property which  they could not carry with them to be  taken by the mob. In fact they shot  down the cattle and hogs of the Saints  wherever they could find them, and   robbed them of nearly everything they   could lay their hands upon. Latter-day  Saints were treated with merciless cruelty  and had to endure the most outrageous  abuses. It was with the greatest diffi-  culty that many of them got out of the   State, especially the prominent men; for  there were many men of the State at  that time, who acted as though they   thought it no more harm to shoot a  Mormon than a mad dog. From this   brief explanation you will be able to un-  derstand why some of the brethren  thought we were not required to go back  to Far West to start from there upon our  mission across the ocean to Europe.    Having determined to carry out the 
 122  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE    requirement of the revelation, on the   18th of April, 1839, I took into my   wagon Brigham Young and Orson Pratt:   and Father Cutler took into his wagon   John Taylor and George A. Smith, and   we started for Far West.    On the way we met John E. Page, who   was going with his family, to Quincy,  Illinois. His wagon had turned over,   and when we me him he was trying to   gather up a barrel of soft soap with his   hands. We helped him get up his wagon.   He drove down into the valley below,   left his wagon, and accompanied us on   our way.    On the night of the 25th of April,   we arrived at Far West, and spent the   night at the home of Morris Phelps, who   was not there, however, himself; he,   have been taken prisoner by the mob,   was still in prison.    On the morning of the 26th of April,   1839, notwithstanding the threats of our   enemies that the revelation which was to   be fulfilled this day should not be, and   notwithstanding that ten thousand of the   Saints had been driven out of the State   by the edict of the governor, and though   the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hy- rum Smith, with other leading men were   in the hands of our enemies, in chains   and in prison, we moved on to the tem- ple grounds in the city of Far West, and   held a council, and fulfilled the revela-  tion and commandment given unto us,   and we performed many other things at   the council.    We excommunicated from the Church   thirty-one persons, who had apostatized   and become its enemies.    The "Mission of the Twelve" was   sung, and we then repaired to the south-  east corner of the temple ground, and,   with the assistance of Elder Alpheus  Cutler, the master workman of the   building committee, laid the southeast   chief corner stone of the temple, accord-  ing to revelation.    There were present of the Twelve   Apostles: Brigham Young, Heber C.  Kimball, Orson Pratt, John E. Page,   and John Taylor, who proceeded to   ordain Wilford Woodruff and George   A. Smith to the Apostleship.    The Twelve then took their leave of,   and gave the parting hand to the follow-  ing Saints, agreeable to revelation: A.  Butler, Elias Smith, Norman Shearer,   William Burton, Stephen Markham, Shad- rach Roundy, William O. Clark; John  W. Clark, Hezekiah Peck, Darwin  Chase, Richard Howard, Mary Ann  Peck, Artimesia Granger, Martha Peck,   Sarah Granger, Theodore Turley, Hi- ram Clark, and Daniel Shearer.    Bidding good-by to the small remnant   of the Saints who remained on the temple   ground to see us fulfill the revelation and   commandments of God, we turned our   backs on Far West and Missouri, and   returned to Illinois. We had accom-  plished the mission without a dog moving   his tongue at us, or any man saying,   "Why do you do so?"    We crossed the Mississippi river on the   steam ferry, entered Quincy on the 2d   of May, and all had the joy of reaching   our families once more in peace and   safety.    There was an incident connected with   our journey that is worthy of record.    While we were on our way to fulfill   the revelation, Joseph the Prophet, and   his companions in chains had been liber-  ated, through the blessings of God, from   their enemies and prison, and they passed   us. We were not far distant from each   other, but neither party knew it. They   were making their way to their families   in Illinois, while we were traveling to   Far West into the midts of our enemies.   So they came home to their families and   friends before our return    May the 3d was a very interesting day   to me, as well as to others. In company   with five others of the quorum of the   Twelve, I rode four miles out of town to   Mr. Cleveland's, to visit Brother Joseph   Smith and his family.    Once more I had the happy privilege   of taking Brother Joseph by the hand.   Two years had rolled away since I had   seen his face. He greeted us with great   joy, as did Hyrum Smith and Lyman  Wight, all of who had escaped from   their imprisonment together. They had   been confined in prision six months, and   had been under sentence of death three   times; yet their lives were in the hands  of God, and He had delivered them,   and they were now mingling with their   wives, children and friends, and out of   the reach of the mob. Joseph was   frank, open and familiar as usual, and   our rejoicing was great.    No man can understand the joyful sen- 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  123    sations created by such a meeting, ex-  cept those who have been in tribulation  for the gospel's sake.    After spending the day together, we  returned to our families at night.    On the day following, May 4th, we   met in conference at Quincy, the Prophet  Joseph presiding, which caused great joy  and rejoicing to all the Saints.    On Sunday, May 5th, Joseph Smith   addressed the assembly, followed by  Sidney Rigdon and the Twelve Apostles.   The Spirit of the Lord was poured out  upon us, and we had a glorious day.    On May 6th, I met with the Seventies,   and we ordained sixty men into the  quorums of elders and seventies. Brother  Joseph met with the Twelve, bishops and   elders, at Bishop Partridge's house; and  there were a number with us who were   wounded at Haun's Mill. Among them   was Isaac Laney, who had been, in com-  pany with about twenty others, at the  mill, when a large armed mob fired  among them with rifles and other  weapons, and shot down seventeen of the  brethren, and wounded more. Brother  Laney fled from the scene, but they  poured a shower of lead after him, which  pierced his body through and through.  He showed me eleven bullet holes in his   body. There were twenty-seven in his  coat was literally cut to pieces. One  ball entered one arm-pit and came out   at the other.    Another entered his back and came  out at the breast. A ball passed through  each hip, each leg and each arm. All  these shots were received while he was  running for life, and, strange as it may  appear, though he had also one of his  ribs broken, he was able to outrun his   enemies, and his life was saved. We   can only acklnowledge this deliverance  to be by the power and mercy of God.    President Joseph Young was also  among the number. He also fled, and  although the balls flew around him like  hail, he was not wounded. How myster-  ious are the ways of the Lord!    Before starting on our missions to  England, we were under the necessity of   settling our families. A place called   Commerce, afterwards named Nauvoo,   was selected as the place at which our   people should settle.    I left Quincy, in company with   Brother Brigham Young and our families   on the 15th of May, and arrived in   Commerce on the 18th. After an inter-  view with Joseph we crossed the river at   Montrose, Iowa. President Brigham   Young and myself, with our families,  occupied one room about fourteen feet   square. Finally Brother Young obtained   another room and moved into it by him-  self. Then Brother Orson Pratt and   family moved into the same room with   myself and family.    While I was living in this cabin in the   old barracks, we experienced a day of   God's power with the Prophet Joseph.  It was a very sickly time and Joseph had  given up his home in Commerce to the   sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-  yard and was living in that himself.   The large number of Saints who had  been driven out of Missouri, were flock-  ing into Commerce; but had homes  to go into, and were living in wagons,  in tents, and on the ground. Many,  therefore, were sick through the ex-  posure they were subjected to. Bro-  ther Joseph had waited on the sick,  until he was worn out and nearly sick  himself.    On the morning of the 22nd of July,  1839, he arose reflecting upon the sit-  uation of the Saints of God in their  persecutions and afflictions, and he   called upon the Lord in prayer, and the  power of God rested upon him mightily,   and as Jesus healed all the sick around  Him in His day, to Joseph, the Prophet  of God, healed all around on this occa-  sion. He healed all in his house and  door-yard, then, in company with Sidney   Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he   went through among the sick lying on  the bank of the river, and he com-  manded them in a loud voice, in the  name of Jesus Christ, to come up and  be made whole; and they were all healed.   When he healed all that were sick on   the east side of the river, they crossed  the Mississippi river in a ferry-boat to  the east side, to Montrose, where we  were. The first house they went into  was President Brigham Young's. He  was sick on his bed at the time. The  Prophet went into his house and healed  him, and they all came out together.   As they were passing by my door, Brother   Joseph said: &quot;Brother Woodruff, fol-  low me." These were the only words 
 124  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.     spoken by any of the company from the  time they left Brother Brigham's house  till we crossed the public square, and  entered Brother Fordham's house. Bro-  ther Fordham had been dying for an  hour, and we expected each minute  would be his last.    I felt the power of God that was  overwhelming His Prophet.    When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham,  and took him by the right hand; in his  left hand he held his hat.    He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes  were glazed, and that he was speechless  and unconscious.    After taking hold of his hand, he  looked down into the dying man's face  and said: "Brother Fordham do you  not know me?" At first he made no   reply; but we could all see the effect of  the spirit of God resting upon him.    He again said: "Elijah, do you not  know me?"    With a low whisper, Brother Ford-  ham answered, "Yes!"    The Prophet then said, "Have you  not faith to be healed?"    The answer, which was a little plainer  than before, was: "I am afraid it is too  late. If you had come sooner, I think  it might have been."    He had the appearance of a man wak-  ing from sleep. It was the sleep of  death.    Joseph then said: "Do you believe  that Jesus is the Christ?"    &quot;I do, Brother Joseph,&quot; was the re-  sponse.    Then the Prophet of God spoke with  a loud voice, as in the majesty of the  Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, in  the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise  and be made whole!"    The words of the Prophet were not  like the words of man, but like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the  house shook from its foundation.    Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed  like a man raised from the dead. A  healthy color came to his face, and life  was manifested in every act.    His feet were done up in Indian meal  poultices. He kicked them off his feet,  scattered the contents, and then called  for his clothes and put them on. He  asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and  ate it; then put on his hat and followed  us into the street, to visit others who  were sick.    The unbeliever may ask: "Was there  not deception in this?"    If there is any deception in the mind  of the believer, there was certainly  none with Elijah Fordham, the dying  man, nor with those who were present  with him, for in a few minutes he would  have been in the spirit world, had he  not been rescued. Through the bless-  ing of God, he lived up till 1880, in  which year he died in Utah, while all  who were with him on that occasion,  with the exception of one, are in the  spirit world.    Among the number were Joseph and  Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt.  Wilford Woodruff is the only one living  who was present at that time, and he  will soon mingle with those who have  gone.    As soon as we left Brother Fordham's  house, we went into the house of Joseph B. Noble, who was very low and danger-  ously sick.    When we entered the house, Brother  Joseph took him by the hand and com-  manded him, in the name of Jesus  Christ, to arise and be made whole.  He did arise and was immediately  healed.    While this was going on the wicked  mob in the place, led by one Kilburn,   had become alarmed, and followed us  into Brother Noble's house.    Before they arrived there, Brother  Joseph had called upon Brother Ford-  ham to offer prayer.    While he was praying, the mob en-  tered with all the evil spirits accom-  panying them.    As soon as they entered, Brother  Fordham, who was praying, fainted and  sank to the floor.    When Joseph saw the mob in the  house, he arose and had the room cleared  of both that class of men and their at-  tendant devils. Then Brother Fordham  immediately revived and finished his  prayer.    This case of Brother Noble's was the  last one of healing upon that day. It   was greatest day for the manifestation of  the power of God through the gift of

When we left Brother Noble, the  Prophet Joseph went, with those who   accompanied him from the other side to  the banks of the river, to return home.    While waiting for the ferry-boat, a  man of the world knowing of the mir-  acles which had been performed, came  to him and asked him if he would not  go heal two twin children of his  about five months old, who were both   lying sick nigh unto death.    They were some two miles from Mon- trose.    The Prophet said he could not go;  but, after pausing some time, he said  he would send some one to heal them;  and he turned to me and said:  "You go   with the man and heal his children."    He took a red silk handkerchief out   of his pocket and gave it to me, and  told me to wipe their faces with the  handkerchief when I administered to  them, and they should be healed.  He  also said unto me:  "As long as you will  keep that handkerchief, it shall remain  a league between you and me."    I went with the man, and did as  the Prophet commanded me, and the chil-  dren were healed.    I have possession of the handkerchief   unto this day.    On the first of July, 1839, Joseph  Smith and his counselors, Sydney Rig- don and Hyrum Smith, crossed the river   to Montrose, to spend the day with the  Twelve, and set them apart and bless  them, before they started unon their   missions.  There were twelve of us who  met there, and we all dined in my   house.    After dinner, we assembled at Brother   Brigham Young's house for our meeting.    Brother Hyrum Smith opened by   prayer; after which the Presidency laying on of hands|laid  their hands upon our heads and gave   each of us a blessing.    President Rigdon was mouth in bless-  ing me, and also blessed Sisters Young,  Taylor and Woodruff.    The prophet Joseph promised us if we  would be faithful, we should be blessed   upon our mission, have many souls as   seals of our ministry, and return again  in peace and safety to our families and   friends; all of which was fulfilled.    Brother Hyrum advised me to preach  the first principles of the gospel; he  thought that was about as much as this  generation could endure.    Then Joseph arose and preached some  precious things of the kingdom of God   unto us, in the power of the Holy Ghost;   some of which I here copy from my  journal:    "Ever keep in exercise the principle  of mercy, and be ready to forgive our  brethren on the first intimation of their  repentance and desire for forgiveness;   for our Heavenly Father will be equally   as merciful unto us.  We also ought to  be willing to repent of and confess our  sins, and keep nothing back.  Let the  Twelve be humble and not be exalted,  and beware of pride and not seek to ex-  cel one another, but act for each other's   good, and honorably make mention of  each other's names in prayer before the   Lord and before your fellow-men. Do   not backbite or devour a brother.  The  elders of Israel should seek to learn by  precept and example in this late age of  the world and not be obliged to learn  everything we know by sad experience.   I trust the remainder of the Twelve will  learn wisdom and not follow the example  of those who have fallen.  When the   Twelve, or any other witnesses of Jesus  Christ, stand before the congregations  of the earth, and they preach in the   power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, and the people are astonished   and confounded at the doctrine, and say  &apos;That man has preached a powerful ser-  mon,' then let that man or those men  take care that they do not ascribe the  glory unto themselves, but be careful  that they are humble, and ascribe the   glory to God and the Lamb; for it is by  the power of the Holy Priesthood and  the Holy Ghost that they have the power   thus to speak.    "Who art thou, O man, but dust! and  from whom dost thou receive thy power  and blessings, but from God?    "Then let the Twelve Apostles and  Elders of Israel observe this key, and be  wise:  Ye are not sent out to be taught,   but to teach.    "Let every man be sober, be vigilant,  and let all his words be seasoned with   grace, and keep in mind it is a day of   warning, and not of many words.    "Act honestly before God and man;  beware of sophistry, such as bowing and 
 126  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    scraping unto men in whom you have no  confidence. Be honest, open, and frank  in all your intercourse with mankind.    "I wish to say to the Twelve and all  the Saints, to profit by this important  key, that in all your trials, troubles,  temptations, afflictions, bonds, imprison-  ments and deaths, see to it that you do  not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not  betray the revelations of God, whether  in the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doc- trine and Covenants, or any of the  words of God.    "Yea, in all your troubles, see that  you do not this thing, lest innocent  blood be found upon your skirts, and ye  go down to hell.    "We may ever know by this sign that  there is danger of our being led to a fall  and apostasy when we give way to the  devil, so as to neglect the first known  duty; but whatever you do, do not be-  tray your friend."    The foregoing are some of the instruc-  tions given to the Twelve the the Prophet Joseph, before they started upon their  missions.    Inasmuch as the devil had been in a   measure thwarted by the Twelve going  to Far West, and returning without  harm, it seemed as though the destroyer  was determined to make some other at-  tempt upon us to hinder us from per-  forming our missions; for it seemed that  as soon as any one of the Apostles began  to prepare for departing, he was smitten  with chills and fever or sickness of some  kind.    Nearly all of the quorum of the  Twelve or their families began to be  sick, so it still required the exercise of a   good deal of faith and perseverance to  start off on a mission.    On the 25th of July, for the first time  in my life, I was attacked with chills and  fever; and this I had every other day,  and, whenever attacked, I was laid pros-  trate.    My wife, Phoebe, was also soon taken  down with the chills and fever, as were  quite a number of the Twelve.    I passed thirteen days in Montrose  with my family, after I was taken sick,  before I started on my mission.    The 7th of August was the last day I  spent at home in Montrose, and although  sick with the chills and fever the most of   the day, I made what preparations I  could to start on the morrow on a mis-  sion of four thousand miles, to preach  the gospel to the nations of the earth,  and this, too, without purse or scrip,   with disease resting upon me, and a  stroke of fever and ague once every two  days.    Early upon the morning of the 8th of  August, I arose from my bed of sickness,  laid my hands upon the head of my  sick wife, Phoebe, and blessed her. I   then departed from the embrace of my  companion, and left her almost without  food or the necessaries of life.    She parted from me with the fortitude  that becomes a Saint, realizing the re-  sponsibilities of her companion. I quote  from my journal:    "Phoebe, farewell! Be of good cheer;  remember me in your prayers. I leave  these pages for your perusal when I am  gone. I shall see thy face again in the  flesh. I go to obey the commands of  Jesus Christ."    Although feeble, I walked to the  banks of the Mississippi river. There  President Young took me in a canoe  (having no other conveyance) and pad-  dled me across the river.    When we landed, I lay down on a  side of sole leather, by the post office,  to rest.    Brother Joseph, the Prophet of God,  came along and looked at me.    "Well, Brother Woodruff," said he,  "You have started upon your mission."    "Yes," said I, "but I feel and look  more like a subject for the dissecting  room than a missionary."    Joseph replied: "What did you say  that for? Get up, and go along; all  will be right with you!"    I name these incidents that the reader  may know how the brethren of the  Twelve Apostles started upon their mis-  sions to England, in 1839.    Elder John Taylor was going with me,  and we were the first two of the quorum  of the Twelve who started on their  mission.    Brother Taylor was about the only  man in the quorum that was not sick.    Soon a brother came along with a  wagon, and took us in. As we were  driving through the place, we came to  Parley P. Pratt, who was stripped to the  shirt and pants with his head and feet 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  127    bare. He was hewing a log, preparing  to build a cabin.    He said: "Brother Woodruff, I have   no money, but I have an empty purse,  which I will give you." He brought it  to me, and I thanked him for it.    We went a few rods further, and me,   Brother Heber C. Kimball, in the same  condition, also hewing a log, towards  building a cabin.    He said: "As Parley has given you a   purse, I have got a dollar I will give you  to put in it."    He gave me both a dollar and a bless-  ing.    We drove sixteen miles across a prairie,  and spent the night with a Brother Mer- rill. The day following we rode ten  miles, to a Brother Perkins', and he took  us in his wagon to Macomb, and from  thence to Brother Don Carlos Smith's.    I rode four hours during the day over  a very rough road of stones and stumps,  lying on my back in the bottom of the  wagon, shaking with the ague, and I  suffered much.    We held a meeting in a grove near  Don Carlos Smith's, and here Elder Taylor baptized George Miller, who  afterwards was ordained a bishop.    At the meeting the Saints gave us nine  dollars, and George Miller gave us a  horse to help us on our journey.    I rode to Rochester with Father Col- trin, where I had an interview with  several families of the Fox Island Saints,  whom I had brought up with me from   Fox Islands in 1838. I spent several  days with them and at Springfield, where  Elder Taylor published fifteen hundred  copies, in pamphlet form, of a brief  sketch of the persecutions and sufferings  of the Latter-day Saints, inflicted by the  inhabitants of Missouri.    We sold our horse, and in company  with Father Coltrin, Brother Taylor and  myself left Springfield, and continued  our journey.    I had the chills and fever nearly every  other day, which made riding in a lum-  ber wagon very distressing to me, es-  pecially when I shook with the ague.    On the 24th of August, we rode to  Terre Haute, and spent the night with  Dr. Modisett. I suffered much with the  chills and fever.    Elder John Taylor up to this time had  appeared to enjoy excellent health, but  the destroyer did not intend to make  him an exception to the rest of the  Apostles. On the 28th of August, he  fell to the ground as though he had been  knocked down. He fainted away, but  soon revived. On the following day,  however, the enemy made a powerful  attack upon his life. He fainted away  several times, and it seemed as though  he would die. We stopped several hours  with him at a house by the wayside.  We then took him into the wagon and  drove to Horace S. Eldredge's and  spent the remainder of the day and night  doctoring him.    In the morning Brother Taylor was so  far recovered that he thought he would  be able to ride. So we started on our  journey on the morning of the 30th, and  we traveled forty miles, to Louisville,  and spent the night with the family of  Brother James Townsend.    We felt terribly shaken up, being in  such a weak state. Brother Townsend  was away from home, but we were kindly  entertained by Sister Townsend.    In the morning Elder Taylor, though  very weak, felt disposed to continue his  journey. We traveled fourteen miles to  Germantown. He was quite sick at  night, and the bilious fever seemed to  settle upon him. I was also very feeble,  myself.    On the day following, September 1st,  being Sunday, Brother Taylor concluded  to remain there for the day, and hold a  meeting.    It was a German settlement. He   wished me to speak, and I spoke upon  the first principles of the gospel. He  followed me, and spoke until he was ex-  hausted.    After we returned to the inn where we  were stopping, I was taken with a chill  and fever, and had a very bad night.  Brother Taylor was also very sick.    The following day, September 2d, was  a painful day to my feelings. It was  evident that Brother Taylor had a settled  fever upon him, and would not be able  to travel.    Father Coltrin was resolved to con-  tinue his journey, and, in conversing  with Brother Taylor, he thought it better  for one sick man to be left than for two,  as I was so sick with the chills and fever  that I was not able to render him any  assistance, nor, indeed, to take care of   
 128  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    myself. Under these circumstances,  Brother Taylor advised me to continue  my journey with Brother Coltrin, and  make the best of my way to New York.    After committing Elder Taylor into   the hands of the Lord, though painful  to me, I gave him the parting hand and  started. I left him in Germantown,  Wayne County, Indiana, in the hands of  a merciful God and a kind and benevo-  lent family, who promised to do ever-  thing in their power to make him com-  fortable until his recovery.    This they did, though he passed   through a severe course of the billious fever and was sick nigh unto death.   Through the mercy of God, however,  he recovered from his sickness, and con-  tinued his journey. We next met in the   City of New York.    I continued my journey with Father   Coltrin, and we reached Cleveland on  the 18th of September. We there took  steamer for Buffalo, but were three days   and a night in a storm before we made   the harbor. We landed at midnight,   and in doing so we ran into a schooner,  and stove it in.    From Buffalo I traveled to Albany in  a canal boat, and had a stroke of the   ague daily.    While on my journey, at Albany, I   took a stage in the night, and rode to  my father's home in Farmington, on the  21st of September.    I was glad to meet with my father's   family and the other members of the   small branch of the Church which ex-  isted there upon this occasion, as I found  them all strong in the faith of the gos-  pel, and glad to meet with me.    I was still suffering with the ague daily.    On the 27th of September, my grand-  mother (on my mother's side), Anna  Thompson, died at Avon. She was   eighty-four years of age.    It was a singular coincidence that she   with her husband, Lot Thompson, also   Mercy Thompson and Samuel Thomp- son, all of one family, died when they   were eighty-four years of age.  I was  not able to attend my grandmother's  funeral.    On the 4th of October, 1839, my   uncle, Adna Hart, died, aged forty-three  years. I had visited him in his sickness,  and preached the gospel to him, and he   was believing. I had also been associated  with him from my youth up.    On his death-bed he sent me a request  that I would preach his funeral sermon.    I was having the chills and fever   daily at the time, attended with a very  severe cough, so much so, that my father  thought that I would never leave his  home alive. But when they brought me  the request of my dying uncle, and the  day came for his burial, I told my father  to get his horse and buggy ready, for I   was going to attend the funeral.    He thought I was very reckless in re-  gard to my own life, as I had suffered   with chills and fever some fifteen  days, and to attempt to speak in my  weak state, and to begin at the same   hour that my chill was to come on,  seemed to him foolhardy.    My parents were quite alarmed, yet  according to my request my father got   up his team, and I rode with him and   my step-mother five miles, through a   cold, chilly wind, and I commenced  speaking to a large congregation, at the  same hour that my chill had been in the   habit of coming on.    I spoke over an hour with great free-  dom, and my chill left me from that   hour, and I had no more attacks for   many days.    On the Monday following, October   17th, I felt sufficiently restored to health   to continue my journey. I took leave of  my father and sister, and left for New   York, where I arrived on the morning  of the 8th of November.    I spent two months and seven days  after my arrival in New York, in travel-  ing and preaching in that city, New Jersey and Long Island, a portion of the  time with Parley and Orson Pratt. I   had frequent attacks during this time of  the chills and fever, but I preached al-  most daily.    On the 13th of December I attended   our conference in New York City, with   Parley P. Pratt, and on this day Elder   John Taylor arrived in our midst, and it  was a happy meeting.    He had passed through a severe siege  of sickness after we parted but through  the mercy of God had been preserved,   and was able to continue his journey.  He also informed us that others of the  Twelve had suffered a great deal of sick-

After spending six days in New York,  Elder John Taylor, in company with  Elder Theodore Turley and myself sailed  out of New York Harbor for Liverpool,  on board the packet ship Oxford , on the   19th of December, 1839.    We took steerage passage, which cost   fifteen dollars each. We had storms and  rough weather, but most of the winds  were favorable for a quick passage.    While on the ship, a Methodist min-  ister got into a discussion with some Cath- olics who were in the company, and the  arguments of the minister ran rather  more into abuse than sound argument.    Elder Taylor told the Methodist min-  ister that he did not think it was becom-  ing in a daughter to find so much fautl  with the mother as they did, for as the  Methodists came out of the Catholics,   Elder Taylor thought the mother had as   much right to enjoy her religion un-  molested as the daughter had. That   ended the argument.    Our company consisted of 109 souls,  composed of Americans, English, Scotch,  Irish, Welsh and Dutch.    We arrived in Liverpool dock on the  11th day of January, 1840, having made  the voyage from New York in twenty-  three days.    On January 13th, 1840, after visiting   Mr. George Cannon, the father of Presi-  dent George Q. Cannon, and his family,  we took cars in the evening, and arrived  in the midst of the Preston branch of  the Saints, built up in 1837, by Elders  Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and   Willard Richards.    We very soon had a pleasant interview  with Elder Willard Richards, who had  remained in Preston to take care of the   Church, while the rest had returned  home to America.    We spent three days at Preston in  visiting the Saints, and on the 17th we  held a council at Elder Richards' home  in that place.    After consulting upon the best course  for us to pursue, it was finally resolved  that Elder John Taylor and Joseph  Fielding go to Liverpool, Elder Wood-  ruff to Staffordshire Potteries, Theodore  Turley to Birmingham, Elder Richards  wherever the Spirit might direct him,  and that William Clayton preside over  the branch in Manchester.    After various principles of the Chruch   had been expounded by the Apostles   present, the council adjourned.    Elder Willard Richards had been  called to be one of quorum of the   Twelve Apostles, but had not yet re-  ceived his ordination.    On the day following I parted with  Elders Taylor and Fielding, who went  to Liverpool, and with Elder Richards,  who tarried in Preston. Elder Turley   and I went to Manchester.    It was the first time I ever visited that  city. I here first met with Elder Wm.  Clayton. As soon as I had an introduc-  tion to him, he informed me that one of   the sisters in that place was possessed of   the devil and he asked me to go and   cast it out of her, thinking that one  the Twelve Apostles could do anything  in this line he might wish to.    However, I went with him to the  house where the woman lay, in the hands  of three men, in a terrible rage, and   trying to tear her clothing from her.    I also found quite a number of Saints  present, and some unbelievers, and who had  come to see the devil cast out and a  miracle wrought.    If I had acted upon my own judge-  ment I should not have attempted to ad-  minister to her with the company pres-  ent, but as I was a stranger there, and  Brother Clayton presided over the   branch, I joined him in administering to  the woman. But the unbelief of the  wicked present was so great, we could  not cast the devil out of her, and she  raged worse than ever.    I then ordered the room to be cleared,  and when the company left the house,   except the few attending to her, we laid hands upon her, and I commanded the   devil to come out of her, in the name of   Jesus Christ. The devil left her, and   she was entirely cured and fell asleep.    The next day being the Sabbath, she   came before a large congregation of peo-  ple, and bore testimony to what the  Lord had done for her. We had a large  assemblage through the day and evening,   to whom I preached the gospel.    On Monday morning, the devil, not  being satisfied with being cast out of the  woman, entered into her little child,  which was but a few months old. 
 130 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    I was called upon to visit the child.  I found it in great distress, writhing in  its mother's arms. We laid hands upon  it and cast the devil out of it, and the   evil spirits had no power over the house-  hold afterwards.    This was done by the power of God,   and not of man. We laid hands upon  twenty in Manchester who were sick,   and they were mostly healed.    On the 21st, I arrived in Burslem by  coach, and met, for the first time, with   Elder Alfred Cordon. This being my   field of labor, I stopped and commenced  work.    Elder Turley stopped in the pottery   district some eight days, then went to   Birmingham, his field of labor.    I received a letter on the 10th of Feb-  ruary, from Elder John Taylor, who was  at Liverpool, saying they had commenced   there and baptized ten persons.    I labored in the Staffordshire Potteries,   Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Lane End,  and several other villages, from the 22d,  of January until the 2d of March  preaching every night in the week and  two or three times on the Sabbath.    I baptized, confirmed and blessed  many, and we had a good field open for   labor. Many were believing, and it ap-  peared as though we had a door open to   bring many into the Church in that part  of the vineyard.    March 1st, 1840, was my birthday,  when I was thirty-three years of age. It  being Sunday, I preached twice through  the day to a large assembly in the City  Hall, in the town of Hanley, and ad-  ministered the sacrament unto the   Saints.    In the evening I again met with a large  assembly of the Saints and strangers, and  while singing the first hymn the Spirit of   the Lord rested upon me, and the voice of God said to me, "This is the last  meeting that you will hold with this peo-  ple for many days."    I was astonished at this, as I had  many appointments out in that district.    When I arose to speak to the people,  I told them that it was the last meeting  I should hold with them for many days.  They were as much astonished as I was.    At the close of the meeting four  persons came forward for baptism, and  we went down into the water and bap-  tized them.    In the morning I went in secret before   the Lord, and asked Him what His will   was concerning me.    The answer I got was, that I should  go to the south, for the Lord had a great  work for me to perform there, as many  souls were waiting for the word of the   Lord.    On the 3d of March, 1840, in fulfill-  ment of the word of the Lord to me, I  took coach and rode to Wolverhampton,  twenty-six miles, and spent the night  there.    On the morning of the 4th I again   took coach, and rode through Dudley,   Stourbridge, Stourport and Worcester,   and then walked a number of miles to   Mr. John Benbow's, Hill Farm, Castle  Frome, Ledbury, Herefordshire. This  was a farming country in the south of   England, a region where no Elder of the  Latter-day Saints had visited.    I found Mr. Benbow to be a wealthy  farmer, cultivating three hundred acres   of land, occupying a good mansion, and  having plenty of means. His wife, Jane,  had no children.    I presented myself to him as a mission-  ary from America, an Elder of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who had been sent to him by the  commandment of God as a messenger of   salvation, to preach the gospel of life  unto him and his household, and the in-  habitants of the land.    Mr. Benbow and his wife received me  with glad hearts and thanksgiving. It  was in the evening when I arrived, hav-  ing traveled forty-eight miles by coach  and on foot during the day, but after  receiving refreshments we sat down to-  gether, and conversed until two o'clock  in the morning.    Mr. Benbow and his wife rejoiced  greatly at the glad tidings which I   brought unto them of the fulness of the   everlasting gospel, which God had re-  vealed through the mouth of His Prophet,  Joseph Smith, in these last days.    I rejoiced greatly at the news that Mr.   Benbow gave me, that there was a   company of men and women--over six  hundred in number--who had broken off  from the Wesleyan Methodists, and taken  the name of United Brethren. They  had forty-five preachers among them,  and had chapels and many houses that 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  131    were licensed according to the law of the  land for preaching.    This body of United Brethren were  searching for light and truth, but had  gone as far as they could, and were con-  tinually calling upon the Lord to open  the way before them, and send them  light and knowledge that they might  know the true way to be saved.    When I heard these things I could  clearly see why the Lord had command-  ed me, while in the town of Hanley, to  leave that place of labor and go to the  south, for in Herefordshire there was a   great harvest-field for gathering many  Saints into the kingdom of God.    I retired to my bed with joy after  offering my prayers and thanksgiving to  God, and slept sweetly until the rising  of the sun.    I arose on the morning of the 5th,  took breakfast, and told Mr. Benbow I  would like to commence my Master's  business, by preaching the gospel to the  people.    He had a large hall in his mansion  which was licensed for preaching, and he  sent word through the neighborhood  that an American missionary would  preach at his house that evening.    As the time drew nigh many of the  neighbors came in, and I preached my  first gospel sermon in the house. I also  preached on the following evening at the  same place, and baptized six persons,   including Mr. John Benbow and his wife,  and four preachers of the United Brethren.    I spent most of the following day in  clearing out a pool of water, and  preparing it for baptizing in, as I saw  many to be baptized there. I afterwards  baptized six hundred in that pool of  water.    On Sunday, the 8th, I preached at  Frome's Hill in the morning, at Stand- ley Hill in the afternoon, and at John  Benbow's, Hill Farm, in the evening.    The parish church that stood in the  neighborhood of Brother Benbow&apos;s, pre-  sided over by the rector of the parish,  was attended during the day by only fif-  teen persons, while I had a large congre-  gation, estimated to number a thousand,  attend my meeting through the day and  evening.    When I arose in the evening to speak  at Brother Benbow&apos;s house, a man en-  tered the door and informed me that he  was a constable, and had been sent by  the rector of the parish with a warrant  to arrest me.    I asked him "For what crime?"    He said, &quot;For preaching to the peo-  ple."    I told him that I, as well as the rec-  tor, had a license for preaching the gos-  pel to the people, and that if he would  take a chair I would wait upon him after  meeting.    He took my chair and sat beside me.  I preached the first principles of the  everlasting gospel for an hour and a  quarter. The power of God rested upon  me, the Spirit filled the house, and the  people were convinced.    At the close of the meeting I opened  a door for baptism, and seven offered   themselves. Among the number were  four preachers and the constable.    The latter arose and said, &quot;Mr. Wood-  ruff, I would like to be baptized."    I told him I would like to baptize  him. I went down to the pool and bap-  tized the seven. We then met together  and I confirmed thirteen, and broke  bread unto the Saints and we all rejoiced  together.    The constable went to the rector and  told him if he wanted Mr. Woodruff  taken up for preaching the gospel, he  must go himself and serve the writ, for   he had heard him preach the only true  gospel sermon he had ever listened to in  his life.    The rector did not know what to make  of it so he sent two clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meet-  ing, and find out what we did preach.    But they were both pricked in their  hearts and received the word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and con-  firmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    The rector became alarmed and did  not dare to send anybody else.    The ministers and rectors of the South  of England called a convention and  sent a petition to the Archbishop of  Canterbury, to request parliament to  pass a law prohibiting the Mormons  from preaching in the British dominion.    In this petition the rector stated that   one "Mormon" missionary had baptized  fifteen hundred persons, mostly members  of the English church, during the last  seven months. 
 132 TULLIDGE'S  QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    But the archbishop and council, know-  ing well that the laws of England gave  free toleration to all religions under the   British flag, sent word to the petitioners  that if they had the worth of souls at  heart as much as they had the ground  where hares, foxes and hounds ran, they  would not lose so many of their flock.    I continued to preach and baptize  daily.    On the 21st day of March I baptized   Elder Thomas Kingston. He was super-  intendent of both preachers and members  of the United Brethren.    The first thirty days after my arrival   in Herefordshire, I had baptized forty-  five preachers and one hundred and   sixty members of the United Brethren  who put into my hands one chapel and   forty-five houses, which we licensed  according to law to preach in.    This opened a wide field for labor,   and enabled me to bring into the  Church, through the blessings of God,   over eighteen hundred souls during eight   months, including all of the six hundred   United Brethren except one person; also  including some two hundred preachers  of various denominations.    This field of labor embraced Hereford-   shire, Gloucestershire and Worcester- shire, and formed the conference of Gar- way, Gadfield Elm and Frome's Hill.    I was visited by President Young and   Dr. Richards.    Brother Benbow furnished us with  £300 to print the first Book of Mor- mon that was published in England: and   on the 20th of May, 1840, Brigham  Young, Willard Richards and I held a   council on the top of Malvern Hill, and   there decided that Brigham Young go  direct to Manchester and publish 3,000  copies of the Hymn Book and 3,000  copies of the Book of Mormon, this  being the first publication of these books  in England.    The power of God rested upon us and   upon the mission.    The sick were healed, devils were cast   out, and the lame were made to walk.    One case I will mention: Mary Pitt,  who died in Nauvoo, Geauga County, Illinois|Nauvoo, sister to Wm. Pitt,  who died in Salt Lake City, had not  walked upon her feet for eleven years.    We carried her into the water and I bap-  tized her.    On the evening of the 18th of May,  1840, at Brother Kingston's house in  Dymock, Elders Brigham Young, Wil-  lard Richards and I laid hands upon her   head and confirmed her.    Brigham Young, being mouth, re-  buked her lameness, and commanded   her to arise and walk, in the name of   the Lord. The lameness then left her,  and she never afterwards used a staff or  crutch.    She walked through the town of Dy-  mock next day, which created a stir  among the people; but the wicked did  not feel to give God the glory.    The whole history of this Hereford-  shire mission shows the importance of  listening to the still small voice of the  Spirit of God and the revelations of the  Holy Ghost.    The Lord had a people there prepared  for the gospel. They were preparing for  light and truth, and the Lord sent me to   them, and I declared the gospel of life  and salvation unto them, and some  eighteen hundred souls received it, and  many of them have been gathered to  Zion in these mountains. Many of them  have also been called to officiate in the  bishopric, and have done much good in  Zion. But in all things we should  ever acknowledge the hand of God, and  give Him the honor, praise and glory,   forever and ever. Amen.    On the 17th of August 1840, I took  the parting hand of the Saints in Here-   fordshire and started on a mission to   London, in company with Apostles  Heber C. Kimball and George A.  Smith. We rode from Leigh to Chel- tenham, where we tarried for the night   and in the morning took coach and rode  forty miles through a most delightful  country, which everywhere wore the   golden hue of a plentiful harvest, passed  through Oxfordshire, in sight of Stowe,   the family residence of the Duke of  Buckingham, and at Farmington Station,   took train for London where we arrived  at 4 p.m. We changed conveyance   to the center of the city by omnibus,  walked across London Bridge into the  Borough, and called upon Mrs. Allgood  the sister of Elder Theodore Turley's   wife. She treated us with kindness,  gave us refreshments and then directed   us to a public house, the King's Arms,  King Street, Borough. Here we tarried  for the night. 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  133    We were now in England&apos;s great met-  ropolis to sound to it the first proclama-  tion of the Latter-day Work: for Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, and my-  self were the three first elders in London  to preach the Gospel and establish the  Church of Latter-day Saints.    We took a walk into the city, passed  London Bridge twice, and returned and  spent the night at the King's Arms.    On the following day we called   upon the Rev. J. E. Smith, Lin- coln's Inn Fields, also visited John Pye, 16 Curiosity Street, Chancery  Lane. He was a strong believer in the  prophecies of Joanna Southcott and was  one of the society. We then returned   and had a view of St. Paul's Cathedral,  the largest in the world except St. Peter's  in Rome. We crossed London Bridge,  took tea at 19 King Street, and then  went to Union Chapel, Waterloo Road,   and heard a comical sermon delivered  by an Aitkenite preacher. I spent the  night at 58 King Street at Mrs. Loftus.    The next day, August the 21st, was  the most interesting sight-seeing day in  my life, as far as viewing the splendid  works of man. I started in company  of Elders Heber C. Kimball and George  A. Smith for a walk over the City of  London. We crossed London Bridge,  passed through King William Street,  and several other streets, and visited  Covent Garden; then through St. Mar-  tin Street and Court, Leicester Square,  Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Pica- dilly, Glass House Street and through  most of Regent Street,--one of the   most splendid streets in the world. We  passed through Langham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire naked  from its base to the top, then through  Oxford Street, and returned by way of  St. Paul's, ending our sight-seeing of the  day by visiting the noted monument  erected in commemoration of the great  fire in London in 1666, and built under  the direction of that famous architect,  Sir Christopher Wren. We entered a  door at its base, paid six pence on enter-  ing, and ascended three hundred and  forty-five black marble steps, which  brought us up two hundred feet into the  air and about one hundred feet higher  than the highest houses. We stepped on  the outside of the pillar, which is sur-  rounded by an iron railing, and here we   had presented to our view an indescrib-  able scenery on every hand of the great-  est city in the world, which can boast of  a history of nearly two thousand years.  At our feet, as it were, lay a historical  panorama, stretching out to our view  around.    We were situated so as to overlook  nearly every part of the city. East of  us lay the ancient Tower of London;  east of us also lay the Mint; north the  Mansion House of the Lord Mayor of  London; north-west, St. Paul's Church;  west, Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament; south lies the River Thames with five of the large bridges  across in full view and one not seen from  the Monument, making six. These six  bridges are fine sights in themselves.  They are the architectural monuments  of the Thames, and our view of them  from our high pinnacle with their crowds  of moving and everchanging human  masses, and cabs, omnibuses, carriages,   drays, etc., which dash along, presented  to us a picturesque sight. In addition  to all this, within our view, was London   Borough, on the south of the river, and  all around us hundreds of churches,  chapels, and spires, standing in the  midst of one universal mass of buildings,  covering about six square miles of   ground. While viewing this prospect on  a clear day, we conversed with a Prussian  traveler, a citizen of Berlin, who had  traveled much over Europe and Asia and  other parts of the world, and he declared  that we could not find another spot on   the face of the earth that would present  to our view so grand a scenery as the  one before us.    August 23d we went to Zion's chapel  and heard the celebrated Rev. Robert Aitken preach two sermons. He de-  livered a powerful warning to the  Gentiles, and presented some of the  most sublime truths I ever heard from a  sectarian priest; but he was building  without the foundation.    On the 24th we removed our lodgings   to Mr. Robert Merryfields, No. 15  Gloucester Row, Grange Road, where  we obtained a room for all three of us.    On the 25th of August we attended a  meeting of the Temperance Society, at  their hall, which we engaged, but could  not have it until the 7th of the next  month. Brother Smith made a short 
 134  TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    speech. On the following day, we  started out to try to get some doors  opened for preaching. Brother Kimball  went to one part of the city and Brother Smith and myself to another. We called  upon two Baptist ministers and asked  one for his chapel. In the evening we  attended a Methodist meeting in Long  Lane.    Next day we again went to the Tem- perance Hall, in St. George's Road near  the Elephant and Castle, and by the re-  quest of the committee I addressed the  meeting upon the subject of temperance,  followed by George A. Smith. We gave  out an appointment to preach the Gos-  pel at that place September 7th.    The day after, we all started out to go  through the city of London to see if we  could find a man with the Spirit of God,  and after wandering through the city,  not knowing whither we went, we came  upon a man and stopped him and spoke  to him. Brother Kimball asked him  if he was a preacher? He said  he was. He seemed to have a good  spirit, and informed us that he had been  to America, and had come to London  for the purpose of going to South Aus-  tralia, but had just buried one child and  another lay at the point of death. Broth-  er Kimball told him his child should  live. He gave us some information  where we could preach. On the same  day we called upon him and found his  child better, but he was not at home.  We then went and heard a Calvinist  preach, and he gave us an invitation to  call and see him.    Next day we again went over the city  to see if we could find any of the chil- dren of God. We found one man and   his household who received our testi-  mony, and he opened his doors for us to  preach. We appointed a meeting at his  house for Sunday evening. His name  was Corner, and he lived at 52 Iron-  monger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near   the church.    We had spent twelve days in going to  and fro through London, trying to find  a people willing to receive our testi-  mony, but finding the doors shut against  us, we determined in the name of God  to go into the streets and lift up our voices.    Accordingly, Elders Kimball, Smith,  and myself started out on Sunday morn-  ing, August the 30th, walked three miles  and stopped in Tabernacle Square, Old   Street, where we found an Aitkenite  preaching to the people, who was fol-  lowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the  latter was about to begin, Elder Kimball  informed him that there was a preacher  from America present who would like to  speak when he got through. The preacher  then informed the people that there was  an American minister present, and pro-  posed that he should speak first. Elder  George A. Smith then got into the chair,  and spoke about twenty minutes, and  then the Presbyterian spoke. George A.  had informed the people that there were  two other American preachers present  who would like to address them, and,  when the Presbyterian closed, Elder  Kimball asked him if there would be any  objection to our preaching there at three  o'clock. He answered, "No, not at all.  What denomination do you belong to?"  "To the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- ter-day Saints," was the reply.    "Oh, I have heard of them," he said.   "They are a bad people; they have done  much hurt; they divide churches; we  don't want to hear you."    He then mounted the chair again and  said to the people, "I have just heard  that the last man who spoke belongs to  the Latter-day Saints," and he began to  rail against us.    Elder Kimball asked him to let him  step into the chair to give out an ap-  pointment for a 3 o'clock meeting, but  he would not let him. Brother Kimball  then raised his voice and informed the  people that some American preachers  would preach there at 3 o'clock.    At the appointed time we were at the   place. The conduct of the preacher and  the excitement upon the subject brought  a large congregation to hear us. I  opened the meeting by singing and  prayer and spoke about twenty minutes,  from Gal. I. 8-9 v., and was followed by  Elder Kimball for about the same length  of time. The people gave good attention  and seemed to be much interested in  what they heard.    After meeting, Mr. Corner invited us  home; but soon after we arrived at his  house, Elder Kimball felt impressed to  return to the place of preaching. When  he got there he found a large company  talking about the things which they had 
 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.  135    heard, and they wished him to speak to  them again. He did so and addressed  them at considerable length, and after-  ward several invited him home to their  houses.    While he was away a man who had   been a preacher came to Mr. Corner's;  I gave him a brief account of the great  work of God in the last days and they  received the things which I spake unto  them. Mr. Corner offered himself for  baptism. This was the first man in the  city of London who offered himself for  the ordinance of the Gospel. We ap-  pointed the next evening to administer  the ordinance of baptism unto him.  After supping with him we returned  home. I was weary and unwell during  the night, but felt thankful unto the  Lord for the privilege of preaching to  the inhabitants of this great city and to  have gained one soul as a seal to our  ministry.    On the 31st of August we reaped the  first fruits of our labors and laid the first  living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ  in England's great metropolis.    We walked into the city and called  upon Mr. Corner, who went forward  with us to the public baths and received  the initatory ordinance of the Gospel.   He was baptized by Brother Kimball.    Returning to the house of Brother  Corner, Elders Kimball, Smith and my-  self laid our hands upon his head and  confirmed him a member of the Church.  We returned to our homes that night,  thankful unto God for his goodness in  blessing our labors even thus much.    On the 2d of September I was quite  ill. I had been unwell for several days,  but now I was obliged to keep to me  room; but Elders Kimball and Smith  went into the city to visit the people and  found some who hearkened to them favor-  ably. We had by this time found that  London was the hardest place for a mis-  sion that we had ever undertaken, but  we did not feel discouraged in the least,  and were determined in the name of the  Lord to set up the standard of the King-  dom in that city.    The following day I was still confined  to my room most of the time, but on  the next, Elders Kimball and Smith went  to Debtford, and I took a walk into the  city, called upon Brother Corner and  found him in good spirits. I also called  upon Mr. Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,  Basin, who was a director of a Methodist  chapel. I asked him for the chapel to  preach in. He said he had a school  house which would hold two hundred,  and that I might have that on Sunday.  So I gave out an appointment at Bowl  Court, 137 Shordeitch. I conversed  with several others who received my tes-  timony, and one woman said she would  be baptized.    Sunday, September the 6th, I preached  in the morning at Bowl Court, 137  Shoreditch, and was followed by Elders  Kimball and Smith. We also held a  meeting in Tabernacle Square, at 3  o'clock in the afternoon, at which Elders  Kimball and Smith preached and I bore  my testimony to their words. One man  arose and opposed us, and was angry be-  cause of the truth of God. He continued  opposing, until the police stopped the  conversation.    We met again in the evening at Bowl  Court, to preach to the people, but   when we got there we found a plan con-  trived by several of the preachers for  one of them to preach, lest some should  believe our testimony. We went our  way and found four persons who re-  ceived our testimony and offered them-  selves for baptism.    Next day I wrote to Elder Browett of  my Herefordshire field of labor, and  walked to Brother Corner's and visited  several other friends. Two offered them-  selves for baptism. I visited St. Paul's  and then returned home. Elders Kim-  ball and Smith had just returned from a  visit to the Rev. Robert Aitken. He   received them kindly, acknowledged  their doctrine true, but was afraid of  deception. His mind was in a disturbed  state.    In the evening we held a meeting in  the Temperance Hall; but we had al-  most the bare walls to preach to, there  being only about thirty present. I  preached to the few present for about an  hour, and Elder Kimball followed me.  After paying seven shillings and six  pence for the use of the hall we returned  to our lodgings.    On September the 9th I paid my bills   and called upon the friends,, in company  of Brothers Kimball and Smith, and on  the day following I parted from the 
 136 TULLIDGE'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    brethren and friends in London to re-  turn to Herfordshire.    We had spent twenty-three days in  that great Babylon of modern times and  had found it harder to establish the  Church there than in any place where  we had ever been. We had baptized  one man, and ordained him a priest;   and six others had given in their names  to be baptized on the following Sunday;  and at this time there was some little  prospect of the Rev. Robert Aitken re-  ceiving the work. I, therefore, left  London feeling that our mission and   labors had not been altogether in vain.    I was rejoiced on my return to the  churches to find that the work was uni-  versally and rapidly progressing in Here-  fordshire. In some cases it was even  reaching the nobility, and a lady of  title had become convinced of the work of God through our ministry.    Lady Roberts was of the nobility of  England and a lady of wealth, and had  withdrawn from the Church of England  and had traveled much in search of truth  looking for the fulfillment of the Pro-  phets.    She became acquainted with the ful- ness of the Gospel through a female  servant in the employ of Squire Dowds- well. She began to investigate the sub-  ject; the Spirit of God rested upon her  and convinced her of the truth of the  work. She obtained the four numbers  published of the Millennial Star, and,  fearing that she should not be able to  obtain them for herself, copied the  whole of them with her pen. She also  read the Book of Mormon and copied a   part of that, and became perfectly con-  vinced of the truth of the work of  which she read, and said she would go a  thousand miles but what she would see  some of the Twelve and be baptized   under their hands. Hearing that I was  in London she was about to take a   journey there to see me, and the other  brethren, and be baptized. She had   two brothers, ministers of the Church of  England.    On the 21st of September, 1840, we  held the Frome's Hill Conference, at  which were represented 24 churches,  with 754 members: 14 elders, 51 priests,  9 teachers and 1 deacon. The Bran  Green and Frome's Hill Conferences  were now composed of 40 churches,  1,007 members: 19 elders, 78 priests,  15 teachers and one deacon.    These two conferences, with their  forty branch churches, and over a thou-  sand organized members, under the di-  rection of one hundred and thirteen  ordained officers, had been raised up  within six months and a half. Surely  the work of God had been marvelous,  unparalleled perhaps in the history of  any new religious movement.    I meditated upon these things, and in  my journal of date September 21st,  1840, I wrote thus:    "This has been a busy day with me.   After standing upon my feet from morn-  ing till evening I am called to shake  hands with hundreds of Saints with glad  hearts and cheerful countenances. It is  with no ordinary feelings that I meditate  upon the cheering fact that a thousand  souls have been baptized into the new and everlasting covenant in about half a   year in one field which God has enabled  me to open. I pray him to accept the  gratitude of my heart for his mercies  and blessings unto me in this thing, and  enable me to stand with these Saints  and all the righteous in His celestial kingdom."    This day I had stood upon my feet   eight hours in conference, conversed  much of the time in suggesting, speak-  ing, motioning, etc.; ordained about   thirty, confirmed some, healed many  who were sick, shook hands with about  four hundred Saints, walked two miles,  and ended with about four hours chim-  ney corner preaching. I then laid down  to rest and dreamt of catching fish.    The church ministers at this time were  very much stirred up in this region be-  cause of the success of the work of God  in the midst of the people, and every   exertion was made by them to stay its  progress. They were finding that the  Lord was delivering their flocks out of  their hands and giving them unto the  shepherds of the Church of the Saints.  They were alarmed and were holding  conventions and meetings to contrive  plans and adopt means to overthrow the   latter-day work of God, which they un-  derstood not, and believed not, yet  feared its power. And well indeed they  might, for in some instances they did  not have more than ten or fifteen at their 
 HISTORY OF SPANISH FORK.  137    churches on the Sabbath, while around  them on every hand they had seen forty  branches of two organized converences  of the Church of Latter-day Saints  spring up in about six months, with over  a thousand members and between one  and two hundred officers ordained to  scatter the seed of the Gospel every-  where in this prolific field.    On the 25th, I again took leave of the  Saints in my Herefordshire field of labor  to attend the conference at Staffordshire,  which was held at Hanley.    The day after the conference I bap-  tized one and preached at Tunstell, and  on the next evening at Burslem to a   crowded audience, and the power of God rested upon me.  Great solemnity  pervaded the congregation. The Spirit of God was moving the people and they  felt that the Lord was doing a work in  their midst.    [TO BE CONTINUED]

Elders Wilson, Ward, Hedlock, & M Holmes were   present in the office when I opened & read it and they all   much rejoiced in its contents. I shall publish most of it   in the next [Millenniel] Star for I know it will do the Saints good  generally to hear the News from America. I rejoice much at the   progress of the Temple and Nauvoo House & the spread of the work   in America. was glad to hear that p. p. pratt was again printing  and that the north was going up, & the south keeping not   back & that the East were bringing their tiths & offerings  into the storehouse of the Lord. The Neighbor spoke of two  Murders one in Nauvoo Hodges and Marshall in Carthage  by Deming the sheriff. The Herald spoke of the annexation   of Texas & probably war with Mexico & perhaps with   England on the Origon question. The Lord said he would plead  in the last days with all flesh with fire & sword. He has already   begin with fire floods Hail storms & whirlwinds in America 
 & other parts of the world their has been a fire of late in   Smyrna seven thousand Houses burned, and as to fires in   America you know about them. & I should not think strange  if Sword followed. Elder Phelps of Boston in his letter   says As the great Mormon gun has exploded & been cut off  from the church viz G. J. Adams that he is now cut off   from the church lecturing against us & is coming to Boston   this is no more than I expected as soon as the church seased  to uphold him in his iniquity that he would be an Enemy   A Rigdonite landed in Liverpool as a missionary   to this land but his stay in Liverpool was vary short  he said he could do no good so near head quarters has   gone to try in the Manchester conference  but the first attack  he made there he was informed by the presiding Elder they had  no business on hand at all for Sidny Rigdon or any body that  followed him. I think his stay in England will be quite   short. I understand he is going to try Ireland. phelps   states that Bennet & others of the party are coming over. we  are quite prepared for them. I have no fears of any of   them they will do but little in England we have published  1500 of O. Hyds address before the High priest quorum in   Nauvoo on Rigdonism which is a good thing to circulate  whil Rigdonism has anything to do. The churches throughout   this kingdom are quite well united considering the   Few labourers we have in the vyne vineyard from America   The Lord knows I shall rejoice to see the day when I can   strike hands with 50 or 100 good wise men who have got 
 their Endowment that can set foot on land at Liverpool to unite   with me in the work in this Land & my prayer is that Elder   Grant of philadelphia may be among the first that I can see after   the Endowment. O how I should rejoice, much could be done   in this land if we had a hundred such men. We have of late   rented one of the most respectable Houses in Liverpool for   th[r]ee years for our printing, Emigration, Joint Stock associ-  ation &c. I hope Br Grant you will make up your mind   to come to Liverpool as soon as you can get your Endowment   we have now but 7 or 8 American Elders in all to labor   away 10 or 12 thousand Saints so it keeps me quite busy   to answer a peak [pack] of letters each day that come to me for   council for one thing or another the work is on the increase  through the British dominons. If war will ownly keep   of[f] a few years we shall send many thousands of Saints   to Zion. I have printed 3000 Books of Doctrines & Covenants  & secured the copywright of the same.

Patriarch John Smith,    Dear Brother:    Your favor of  the 17th inst., in which you state that you are very  close run and have had to borrow in order to meet   your obligations, and informing me that you have drawn  all of your allowance for this quarter ending March,  and are about $3000 behind now and nothing to go on  with for the coming two months, and asking for  help, has been received and its contents considered.    I am informed that you draw at the  rate of $1000.00 a year from the Church, not men-  tioning the amount that is paid to Sister Lemon,  and that your family is small, your children gener-  ally being able to sustain themselves. It seems, Brother

Young asked for twenty  five thousand. We asked him do nothing  about submitting any document to Senate,  or about finances until you arrived. He   replied must have fifteen thousand by  Wednesday, and ten thousand to complete bargain.  He has embarrassed us by not consulting us  for our friends can do better. Can you get  Committee to -[withold]- report until March  fourth, as every, thing can be arranged satis-  factorily by that time. Friends -[say]- if   Committee desire to act in good faith they  will accept this.    Wilford Woodruff.  George Q. Cannon.

When with the advantage of Coak ^Coke^ (made from our late  discovery of Coal with in three miles of Our works afine  article and Extensive deposit.)

Should they meet that kind and liberal patronage  which their friends flatter them they, will have from  a prop[le] devoted, to a policy of self sustaining institutions  on the c^C^ooperative principle.    Isolated as our works are at present and must be for  a time we crave the protection and fostering care of your  honerable body and shall of the Governor and Legislature  to Enable us to place p^P^ermi^a^nately on a firm basis one  of the greatest Enterprizes in the Territory.    Without which her citizens will continue to be dependent  on foreign manufacturers for that which n^N^ature has  in profusion provided us the Oar ^Ore^ to produce namely Iron.  We wish to be Enrolled as life m^M^embers of your Society 
 John, that, under the circumstances which the Church is  in, it should not be called upon to give you further  assistance. You are at liberty, and have the oppor-  tunity of doing something for yourself, and with this  amount given you by the Church, you ought, with good  management, to be able to keep out of debt. It is not  pleasant for me to have to decline an application   such as you make; but the calls upon the Church  are so numerous in every direction that we are compelled  to exercise great care in the disbursement of the funds.    You probably can make arrangements with some  of your friends to assist you in tiding over this pinch  till the next quarter.    With kind regards,    Your Brother,    W Woodruff

Dear Brother:    Your letters of the 24th & 29th ult.  have been received, the last one having just come to  hand, and been perused with considerable interest.  I was very glad to hear of your movements, and   that you are taking the business of the emigration  in hand so promptly and pursuing your investiga-  tions so thoroughly. You will now be in a position  to decide understandingly as to which is the best and  safest route for the people to travel by. Your  familiarity with the Guion Steamships and the  methods they employ will enable you to judge with

OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA    P.O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. March 9th 1888.    Elder Joseph F. Smith,  Washington, D. C.    Dear Brother Joseph F.:    We have just received a very inter-  esting communication, under date of the 3rd inst., from  Brother John T. Caine. In speaking of the Amend-  ment to the Federal Constitution, which is very likely to  come up before the House, he is desirous to know our  views concerning his action upon that question. Mr.   Gibson, it seems, suggested to him in the first place  that he should remain neutral. Brother Caine says,  however, that he has very decided views upon the  subject, and he has outlined a speech that he might  make upon the question that, he thinks, would be 
 considerable certainty as to the merits of the two lines  and to decide which, under the circumstances, is the  better line for the Saints to come by.    Respecting the newspapers of which  you make mention, and from which you send us  extracts, you will be better able to decide after  seeing Maude, who can give you the information  necessary concerning them and the power of our   friends to reach them. His presence in Washington  will enable you to understand the situation much  better than it would be possible to learn by letter  or by telegram, as he can give you a knowledge  of the influences which are at work and the ability  of our friends to reach papers and persons that may  be necessary to make our business successful.   I trust you have been able to see him and that  your interviews have been satisfactory. We received   a dispatch from him after he reached Washington,  in which he informed us that he had not yet  met with you.
