As a missionary to travel around on foot I ^am^ not to be comited upon From 1881-1887 I have been suffering from a disease of the Knee joints which compelled me three years after my arrival in Utah (in 1884) to go back to my native country to undergo a surgical operation. In that oper- ation the entire Knee joint was cut out, rendering my left leg entirely stiff; of course this an't hinder me in the office work I am engaged in but I have never been able to walk long distances; which is one of the most important factors for a missionary or travelling elder.  When I married 2 years ago my first husband, who by some false step was cut off the church in 1885 he had then 2 wifes and each one of them has 2 children by him. The house and lot on which they both lived  belonged to my husband left and as long as I am married this 2nd wife lived in our house and I have so to say cared for them all.

Reynolds, Sec., but bearing  no address. This notice asks if it would be agreeable to  his feeling and consistent with his circumstances for him to go on a mission early in 1892 to Europe. I have taken the  liberty of writing to you personally about him. He is just starting in life, having been married only a few months. He is manager and has full charge of the electric light plant here, and was specially trained that he might take the business in hand. We are just getting established, and if he leaves, I am at a loss to know where his place could be filled, unless by importing a stranger from the east or west. As you are aware, it is not an ordinary business, and takes special training to fit a person to assume charge.

He has been a Protestan Clergyman and not  a mechanic or an unskilled laborer. He has  sacrificed all his worldly hopes for the gospel  and he beleives he has made an excelent  Bargain. He is now however passing through  circumstances that are calculated to try character  and so far as I can discover, he is enduring his  trials with praise worthy submission and equani- mity of disposition. He is now helpless because  he has no means to do anything with. He  told ^me^ while talking matters over, that he  would take a district shool, if he could get  such a position, because he wanted to earn  his own living and not draw upon the  hospitality of his friends. Bro Young has written him an encouraging letter promising  to help in his college scheme. In the mean  time his surroundings wear a gloomy aspect  He is struggling between poverty and hope  and prays for a better day. It may be you  can offer him some comforting counsel.

Dear Brethren:  We have been pained quite frequently of late, when perusing the reports of the Presidents of the various missions, to find so low an average of ability and efficiency among the brethren who have labored under them. This condition unfortunately is not confined to one missionary field, for the reports of all the Presidents make the same showing. And further, the truthfulness of their representations is emphasized by the fact that so many of the brethren return home without having fully filled an honorable mission. Indeed, occasionally some of the elders have scarcely left before they are home again.  These facts have led us to fear that in some cases brethren have been recommended for missions with the desire to get rid of them, or at best to do them good personally, or as the expression is sometimes used "to save them." Now we do not object to men being called who in earlier years may have done wrong, have been rough or wayward in their youth, if in later years they have lived a Godly life and brought forth the fruits of repentance. But we do not want men of bad moral character, habitual users of tobacco, or those whose conduct in any way would render them unworthy of this high calling recommended for missions, under the impression or with the hope that they will repent and change their lives when they get in the mission- ary field. Let them repent of their sins at home and reform their ENDENTRY OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.  P.O. Box B.

We desire it to be esteemed as a high honor to be thus called, as a stamp of the approval of the Lord. Nor do we wish those selected to regard the call in the light of a conscription that they must meet whether willing or not, as men are compelled to serve in the German or other armies of the continent of Europe.  Henceforth a rule will be observed (though of course we ourselves may occasionally depart therefrom) that no brother will be called on a mission unless he is suggested, or if not suggested, en- dorsed by his Bishop and Stake President. These officers will be held responsible for his standing in the church and worthiness at the time he is called. Should a man be suggested by other officers of the church his name will be first submitted to the Bishops and Presi- dents--for the same examination and endorsement as though suggested  originally by them.  It would be much more satisfactory to us if every person who is called to go on a mission could be examined before he is called by, at least, one of the Apostles, but this may not always be practicable. In such a case it is highly important that his fit- ness, financial condition, andc., shall be ascertained by his Bishop and President of Stake, before anything definite is said to him on the  subject; so that he may not be placed in the humiliating position of being excused after being called, quite possibly for no fault for which he is himself responsible.

My wife and myself have all the while been talking of the mat- ter, and figuring up our circumstances, and both are we as anxious that I should respond to the call for me to go.
