I have taken the  liberty of writing to you personally about him. He is just starting in life, having been married only a few months. He is manager and has full charge of the electric light plant here, and was specially trained that he might take the business in hand. We are just getting established, and if he leaves, I am at a loss to know where his place could be filled, unless by importing a stranger from the east or west.

He has been a Protestan Clergyman and not  a mechanic or an unskilled laborer. He has  sacrificed all his worldly hopes for the gospel  and he beleives he has made an excelent  Bargain. He is now however passing through  circumstances that are calculated to try character  and so far as I can discover, he is enduring his  trials with praise worthy submission and equani- mity of disposition. He is now helpless because  he has no means to do anything with. He  told ^me^ while talking matters over, that he  would take a district shool, if he could get  such a position, because he wanted to earn  his own living and not draw upon the  hospitality of his friends.

RECEIVED, NOV 29 1897 Answ'd       the reports of the Presidents of the various missions, to find so low an average of ability and efficiency among the brethren who have labored under them. This condition unfortunately is not confined to one missionary field, for the reports of all the Presidents make the same showing. And further, the truthfulness of their representations is emphasized by the fact that so many of the brethren return home without having fully filled an honorable mission. Indeed, occasionally some of the elders have scarcely left before they are home again.   have been recommended for missions with the desire to get rid of them, or at best to do them good personally, or as the expression is sometimes used "to save them." Now we do not object to men being called who in earlier years may have done wrong, have been rough or wayward in their youth, if in later years they have lived a Godly life and brought forth the fruits of repentance. But we do not want men of bad moral character, habitual users of tobacco, or those whose conduct in any way would render them unworthy of this high calling recommended for missions, under the impression or with the hope that they will repent and change their lives when they get in the mission- ary field.

ENDENTRY  23 April 1891 Rec   Mission ENDENTRY  the house is 14x16 and 12 feet high, sidings outside and boards inside, 2 floors and a shingle roof, the stable is 16x16 but there is no roof and no door on it, and we dug out a place in the ground about 50 feet long, but there is no roof on it and on side is open. It is 10 1/2 miles from the county seat Seward and 1 mile right across from a little town called Bee, with about 100 inhabitants I want 4500 Dol. for it it is worth that we sold 160 acreas a few years ago and we ghot 4800 Dol. for it there was little more improvements on that but this is better land. I could't sell it very well around here, because there is not much money here we had a failcrop this last year. Now if  a man out here or send me a letter right away, because  notes due now, and there is no way ENDENTRY       of the 1 surprised, as well as grateful for being considered worthy and acceptable, as a missionary to the nations of the earth. But with deepest regrett, must inform you, that it seems to me impossible to partake of this privilege, and to respond to the call, at as early a date as the 18 havent got the ready means on hand, and it looks very doubtful, wether I'd be able to obtain the necessary means by that time. I have got some means coming to me, should I receive the same before the 29 gladly and willingly respond to the call, if not, I would kindly ask you for a little more time.   Lord, hope to be enabled, to comply with the request very soon.   I remain Your humble Brother in the Gospel John Vetterli. (354 North, Fifth West St.)  ENDENTRY
