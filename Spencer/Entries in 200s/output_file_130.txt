 Auckland New Zealand  September 89th 1892    President Wilford Woodruff. & Counsellors  Salt Lake City    Dear Brethren;    It becomes  my painful duty to report the death of our  fellow laborer, Bro Otto Chipman ^of American Fork^ afterabout a  weeks illness.  during which time he was attended  by aElder T. C. Stanford, myself and Elders Madsen  and hamblin was with him the last night.  He  had been delirious for three days before death, yet he  recognized and called each of us by name upon  our arrival but soon after relapsed into his former  condition being lost to surroundings.  He died on  the 31st of August and will be shipped by the  outgoing mail.  Elder Stanford and Hawkes will  accompany his body home.  His death sickness is  traceable to getting wet through a canoe capsizing.    Elder Chipman was making good progress in  the language ^during his six months here^ and gave promise of becoming a  very efficient missionary.  But it has been otherwise  ordained.  The sympathy of the Elders for his wife  and relatives, and sorrow at parting with a  true friend has cast a gloom over all. Yet 
 while we sorrow we realize that our kind Heavenly  Father doeth all things well, and we think it  better to be called to labor on the other side of the vail  when active and faithful here, than when in those  conditions of indifference and worldly mindedness  which many of the Saints have drifted into.    Bro Stanford will be able to give you all  the particulars.  I have instructed him to telegraph  you from Sanfrancisco and have you convey the  sad inteligence to the bereaved family.    The expenses  here have been quite heavy as you will see by  the enclosed bill.  Bro Stanford takes £10.0.0 to  pay Rail way charges on the other side, how much  it will require I have no idea, but he will telegraph  for more if he needs it.  He is also to let you know  when he will be in Ogden so that relatives or others  can meet him there.  I supupose the family will  pay all the expenses above the usual return fare    Bro Hardy kindly came to my aid in  money matters.  next month I expect return fares,   as per Bro Reynolds advice, for the two Elders going  now the balance as per bill of £44.4.10 I will  expect by return mail.    In March 1885 ^an^ Elder  Hill was released from this mission by his own  request on account of ill health  he clained he 
 had money to take him home so that nothing was   paid on his return fare.  I was then presiding  here and subsequently learned that he borrowed  £10.0.0 of one Brother Fryer with a promise to  pay it in 3 months.  Elder Charles Heybourne of  Cedar acquainted me with the case and has been  doing all he could to have brother Hill pay it, but  thus far without success.  I think that the amount  ought to be paid with at least Five Pounds interest  added.  And as nothing was paid on brother Hills  return ^fare^ and as it seems he refuses to pay this sum  and did not have the manhood to report it at the  time and ask it to be paid ^then^ I now feel it my  duty to report it to you knowing that you will  take that course that will be proper under the  circumstances. The amount of interest mentioned above  is computed at 5 per cent the legal rate here.   Brother Fryer is still in the church but I am in-  formed that this has been quite a trial to him.    Elder B. Hamblin. has had sore  eyes Since April sometimes better some times worse. he   is now here in Auckland to ^have them^ be treated the dDoctor Says  he will be able to cure them in 4 weeks.  Should he  however not obtain relief, will release him to  return I hope however this will not be necessary  with this exceptions the Elders are all well or  were at last accounts.    On my last visit to the 
 Southren districts a system of home missionary  work was inaugerated, calling into active labor ^service^  an number of the Native's; recent reports from those  district in relation to this labor is very gratifying.    I believe in the majority of the branches we  can report an improvement whilst in some of ^the reverse^  is the case.  A long wet disagreeable winter is  now drawing to a close and we are greatly in hopes  that during the coming summer we will be able  to accomplish considerable good and be able  to make favorable reports.    With best regards  I remain    Yours etc    W. T. Stewart    P. S. Three more Elders will be needed by  the Boat leaving 'Frisco in December    W. T. S.    [Handwriting Changes]  The money should be sent.  And  I would suggest, a letter be written to  bro Hill respecting the payment of that  money he borrowed, and urging him to  meet his obligation.  A few words sent  to R. W. Heybourne, enquiring about  Hill, and asking him to use his influ-  ence, if he had any with, Hill would  no doubt be a good thing.    J. F. S.

That the hand of the Lord was in these  things.    When the Sisters met in  these Meetings, they should be pretty much  to themselves, they should come fill'd with  the Spirit of the Lord.    These Mothers  in Isreal, to speak to each other, both the  young and old should come together,  and speak as they are led, make a meeting  of it, just as we do at conference, not meet  to talk of this or the other.    But the  Aged Listens who have had an experience  that they should speak things to comfort  and bear thier Testimonies, and the  young to listen—that virtue was  lost, in our gentile Cities, and that virtue  was centered with the Saints, that it was  required of us to do right, we have to  redeem the world, and we were the only  ones who practiced virtue.    That we could  make our meetings interesting, and useful.  The Lord would be with us; this was our  Zion. We must be united and come together  not striving to get the Mastery And strive  to get the Spirit of god.    We had done a good deal, and the  Relief Societies, had been a mighty [levece]  to go on, and get the Spirit of the Lord,  come here, Pray before we come, and  we would have a good time.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  EUROPEAN PRINTING, PUBLISHING,  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool,    Jan. 28 1893    Prest. Woodruff Cannon & Smith  S L C Utah    Dear Brethren: I am glad  to inform you that we are all moving along well  and awaiting your selection of elder to act during  the inteirgmun. I am fondly hoping you will answer  my letter by cable, but I shall wait patiently as  possible.    The miserable break made by elders and Saints  in Denmark of which I wrote is healed up and the  work going on smoothly again. The brethren repented  in sackcloth and ashes so far as I can learn  so have the deceived of the saints.    Pardon me for suggesting that a competant committee  be appointed to overhawl the hym^n^ book. I am much con-  cerned about it, but will not tell my troubles they may  easily be discovered by properly appointed persons. We have  tried to past a patch over the line or word a "sinful" sacrifice  for sin. Bro. Reynolds knows the hymn. There are corrections need-  ed, badly needed in other places. Love to Brethren.    Hoping you are well. I am Your Bro.    B. Young

Feb. 7, 93.    Prest. W. Woodruff  &  Councellors    Dear Brethren:    A Communi-  cation from Bro. Geo. Reynolds reach  ed ^me^ last evening, also the portion of  Bro Fred. Stauffer's letter. I am  glad the subject has come before  you again, and I pray the Lord  ^that^ all that He requires may be  accomplished ^in^ the holy land.    I am strongly impressed with the  idea that a competant elder ^or elders^ should  be instructed ^by the presidincy^ and sent to Turkey to  plant the germ, and it seems to ^me^    that the work of the elders ^in years past^ is  about to culminate in a foot  hold being obtained in Asia Minor  to successfully platnt the gospel  among the people.    Bros Musser and Herman  are very intellegent men, but they  need a more experienced man there  to direct in these important matters.    Bro. Musser needs help. I do not  know to ^how we can^ send him help from this  mission, we are weak in numbers  and especially in experienced  men. Scarcely a man in the mission  who has ever been in the missionary field  before.    If Bro Empey & B. S. Young could do   something at or after Conference for to  collect a fund for the Turkish mission  it might be a good thing. I will guarantee  one hundred dollars towards ten thousand,  and this shall not interfere with the  Temple fund for, as long as I have 
 the Turkish mission at heart as now I would stretch  a point to favor it.    Can you provide long lists of names ^of missionaries^ for Apl.  Conference, English, Welsh, Irish, scotch, Scandinavia,  Germany, Switzerland Italy and the Turkish mission  all need special attention. Germany and Scandinavia  absolutely languish; while some of the choicest spirits  on earth are receiving the gospel in England. True they  are few, but the warning reaches them.    I have no confidence in my health. Sometimes  without warning I feel like I would faint away, circu-  lation very feeble, I fast, and that hurts me. I try to be care-  ful in eating and drinking, but there is something wrong with  my breathing aparatious when the air is muggy and cold ^I suffer^ I  mention this to ^give^ a reason why I cannot get down to work  as I would like to.    Have been in south of England where I feel much  better.    I am patiently waiting for some one to take charge as  your letter instructed me. I have done the best I could  in selecting Bro. Solomon to be in Lpool while I am away ^You know his integrity is good while he is no scholar nor speaker in public.^    Wilby has had a few nervous attacks, but I believe he  will be more careful to exercise in future. I have urged  him to not remain in doors long at a time, get out on the   river, top of a bus, walk and ^get^ the purest air he can.

 Porirua, Wellington, N. Z.  April 10th 1897.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    Your favor dated Jan. 30th and Feb.  27th came duly to hand, as also drafts to the value  of $1,000. and $500. respectively. We are applying the  money to liquidate indebtidness for past return  fares, so as to stop interest, and for the return of  Elders T. J. O'Brien, James C. Allen, Jens K. Nelson  and T. S. Browning who were released at our  Annual Conference on the 6th inst., to return home by  May boat. The three will have spent three years  and four months amongst the natives, and Elder  Browning two years and six months amongst Europeans.    Notice of the death of Elder Edward  Stevenson caused a degree of sensation and some  sober reflection, but only to conclude, in the light  of the Gospel, that our loss in his gain, and the  condition far more to be envied than mourned.  But for all that our feelings and sympathies go  out for the family and relatives. O, how much  more need we have for mourning the condition  of some others of whom we hear, when we think  of what already has and necessarily must befall 
 Auckland, N. Z.  Feb 11th 1897.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    We are in receipt of letter dated Jany.  5th reporting five more Elders for this mission.  They have undoubtedly arrived Sydney ere this.  We can use them and also others.    Regarding the £197.0.0 to come next mail,  oweing to the ill-health of Elder Moroni Lazenby  it was deemed wise to release him to return  home by the March boat. Elder C. H. Embley was  also released to accompany him. The former has  been here something over two and the latter some-  thing over three years. I have arranged with  Bro. Hardy to use £50.0.0 of the above amount for  their return fares. And it is desired to release  four more Elders at our April Conference in the  Wairarapa which according to usual allotments  would make in all £150.0.0 more, which we would  be very pleased to receive not later than April.    It will be seen that our report is not made  out as suggested by letter dated Jany. 4th Viz.  giving births and deaths of males and females  separately. And 'tis now too late to change or cor- 
 them except there should hapily be an immediate  and radical change!    The epistle from yourself and colaborers to  the Maori saints, was read to our Conference,  and copier of same presented to Tamahan, Hoani  Rangi Te Kaiwaho, Pu Rakaw and other outside  leading male and female Rangatirai who were  lending much to the support and success of our  Conference, which brought forth much favorable  comment. The remaining copies were given to  Presidents of Conferences for distribution among the  saints. It seemed almost to overjoy the grey-haired  colored veterans, to see that you entertained not  but words of counsel, good will and blessing for  them, though they did not see as we do; and that  so far as we were concerned, we wished to be  at peace with, and have love and good will for  all men, and gave efficacy to what I had told  them, i. e. that you had not sent us out here as  enemies of man or creed, but only to be enemies  of all unrighteousness.    I announced to the Conference your ap-  proval of the saints sending geneologies to Hirini  Whoianga for him to be kept in the Temple work.  I think it will be the means of inspiring them  much in that direction. 
 rect it and reach you for conference. The breth-  eren inform me that this is according to Elder  Jensen's late instructions. We will endeavour to  follow out your suggestions in the future. I would  like to ask if new baptized members are to also  appear in column as members received?    Elder Almond Thomas Butterfield is out here  without any Mission Certificate, or License to  preach.    It was formerly the custom to sustain the  general and mission authorities at our district  as well as mission conferences; but has for  some cause been discontinued. What would be  your feelings and wishes in the matter?    I understand that the original Maori form  or ceremony of marriage is for the parents or  relatives on both sides to come together and mu-  tually consent to the proposed or desired union;  or, if between influential parties of different  tribes, the chiefs of the respective tribes would  mutually consent; and the parties begin living  together as man and wife.    In some parts of the mission the bretheren  are wholly ignoreing the Maori form of Marriage  and disposeing of unions thus brought about as  cases of adultery and fornication and making 
 We were a little disappointed to learn it would   be necessary to make shift, for the present, with   the help we have, no more missionaries having   been called for these parts; however we don't wish   to complain, but will be pleased to accept more   when you see proper to send them. In view of   this Elder Andrew Smith Jr. has been released   from the Presidency of the Tasmania Conference and   appointed to preside over the New South Wales   Conference which will locate him at Sydney, and   suburbs. He has had some 18 months experience   on the mission and is an able, energetic laborer,   and we think will fill that position with credit,   though it was with some degree of reluctance that   we moved him from his former field.    Two Elders should be released in July   next and seven in September. We would therefore   be pleased to receive means in time for the nec-  essary remittances. £25. per head is the usual   allotment.    Since last writing we have held four   District Conferences on tour to the Wairarapa: per-  formed nine baptisms, blessed perhaps as many   children, celebrated a number of marriages and   had a number of instances of healing, some of   which cases had, to all human appearances,

 reached the very jaws of death.    At our Annual Conference we had 28   Zion Elders present and about 500 saints and   friends. The new building was opened with   feast, ceremonies and dedication. Besides which   in the four days ten meetings in the native tongue,   for in neighboring European towns, and our   Elders meeting. The weather was good, and   the Lord indeed blessed us with a time of rejoic-  ing, and we hope much good will grow out   of it all.    Besides your epistle we were favored   by one from our beloved brother and former Prest.   Wm Paxman and one from the Maori Association   which assisted materially in making our Con-  ference as success. The outcome of all was the   location of the Conference there for the another year,   and permanent invitations to come and go at will.   In fact the leaders seem almost what we   would call "Dry land Mormons" and I suppose   held so on account of their position and desire   for continued popularity and influence.    I resume my travels through the mission   attending Conferences, going, in about ten days,  to South Island.    We anxiously look forward to time of recieving 
 them a matter of fellowship. I would be pleased  to hear an expression from you as to wether  or not the above is the proper course to pursue; or  is the ceremony of the Maori nation in this res-  pect entitled to the same respect and acknowl-  edgement as that of other nations?    Making such unions a matter of fellowship  may have grown out of the counsel of former  Presidents to try and educate the Maori people up  to a better ceremony in order to draw as broad a  distinction as could be between marriage and  living in adultry; as perhaps half of the European  population are doing, in some of the cities at least.    Would it be improper for priest, teacher or deacon  to perform the ceremony of marriage out here?    We have a case here where one of our sisters mar-  ried a radical, narrow contracted roman cathlic  european. She sayes she refused positively to give  up her religion, and told him if he married her  he would have to marry a "Mormon" which she was  and would continue to be. He succeeded, however,  in disgraceing her before marriage; and, seeming-  ly would only be too pleased to have her excomuni-  cated; but she earnestly pleads for secret baptism,  as he wont consent to her being rebaptized, and  promises, as far as is in her power, to tend her

The health of the Elders is moderately  good at present, except that of Elder Charles  Petersen who has had first rate health during the  Summer, but wet weather has brought his rheu-  matics back again. We have changed his field  of labor hoping good results will follow.

She has been virtually  suspended for nearly four years.    The europeans are enemies to this people spir-  itually, temporally, physically and morally; and,  seemingly, take delight in draging them down to  death hell and destruction.    My policy has been as long as I could see  something good in a person—some honor or prin-  cipal as a foundation to build upon or hopes of a   future outcome, to hold onto them, and perhaps  I am too much that way. But often the case when  we have decided that mercy ceases to be a vir-  tue and put them on the outside, the Spirit of the  Lord still continues to strive with them and they  arent satisfied until they get back in.    I have just received of Bro. Thomas Finlayson,  West Jordan, $25.50/100, per H B. Hales, and given him an  order for same which I trust will be agreeable  with your feelings; and can be deducted from  above amount, or go towards return fares of  next company, a couple of months later, as you  prefer.

His companion has since in  formed me that he is very low, being  irational and at times heavily  preyed upon by evil influences—  in fact it would seem that we might  hear of the worst taking place at  anytime. It appears that for some  time previous to his being confined  to his bed something weighed heavily  upon his mind by night and by day. 
 held 5, 6, & 7th Insts. was a very interesting and in-  structive one, and particularly noted for the gen-  eral peace and quietude that prevailed in meetings  and on the premises in general. Ten meetings  were held in the three days with twenty-three  Zion Elders in attendance, and between two and  three hundred saints and friends. The Elders meet-  ing held on the 8th continued six hours and a  half; and was one long to be remembered by all  in attendance. The time was spent in singing,  praying, bearing testimony, asking and answer-  ing questions and in giving general instruct-  ions, all were melted down until there was-  ent a dry eye in the room.    I expect to start south in a few days, holding  district conferences down through and reach  Wairarapa for annual conference of mission  April 4th 5, & 6th    We are just now undertakeing to, locate Elders  at Adelaide, South Australia, where we hope to  get an opening and do a good work; as the people,  as near as we have learned, are of a nature in  their surroundings and occupations, that  ought to take to the Gospel quite readily.    I am not aware that any thing has been   done as yet towards introduceing the Gospel 
 but he could not be persuaded to  divulge it, until he became very low  when to all appearance he was in the  act of making a statment of some  kind, when he was suddenly seized  by an unseen power and strangled till  it seemed as if he would not recover  his breath. Since that time and to  last accounts he has been irational.  I have sent word for him to be got   to Sydney if possible, where there are   three Elders and a large branch of the  Church that he might have all the care  that might be consistently expected  by one away from home and rel-  atives; where I hoped, if it were consist-  ent with the will of the Lord, he would  recover or at least sufficiently to  stand the journey home.

 Auckland, New Zealand.  January, 18th 1897    Prest. Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    Enclosed you will please find  the slip that was desired to be filled out,  giving numbers to January 1st 1897.    The company of five Elders arrived  at Auckland December 15th in fair health  and spirits.    The company of eight reached Sydney,  Australia, on the 5th inst. Three were assigned to  labor in Queensland. The remaining five  reached here on the 15th inst., feeling consider-  ably jaded. They report a very rough voyage  from Vancouver, and also from Sydney. The  water broke in upon them and most all  their luggage was wet and more or less  damaged. The blanks, which you sent, were  amongst the rest, their appearance being mat-  erially affected, but will still answer the  purpose for which they are intended, and  I will endeavor to carry out the instructions  when Elders are released to return home.    We are also in receipt of Bro. Reynolds' 
 yours of Aug 4th just now to hand I   will take pleasure in carrying out  the suggestions therein contained to  ^the^ bringing about of a division of the   Australasian Mission and give you  farther particulars by the next Frisco  Mail.    I am now enroute to attend  the Waiapu Conference, we having  just closed a most excellent confer-  ence in the Poverty Bay Dist.   The Elders on the mission, with the   exception of the one above mention  ed, were in their usual condition  of health at last reports and the  work progressing favorabley.    With kindest regards to your  self and co-laborers, your brother  in the Gospel,    E. F. Richards. 
 among the Fijians. They seem to be a much   lower class of people than the Maories; and Prest.  Gardner did not express himself very favor-  ably after his short visit, or call in, on way  home; however, inasmuch as there seems to be  a general good feeling and willingness to hear  us pretty much all over the world, if you feel  that the time has come when they should be  offered the Gospel, I will be pleased to carry out  any suggestion you may be led to make re-  garding the matter.    The same condition also exhists with regard  to the Chatham and Stewardt Islanders.    We have had a dreadful storm here of late,  doing much damage on land and on sea,  causeing much destruction of property and  some loss of life. 'Tis again raining yester-  day and today.    The health of the Elders generally is pretty  good at present, so far as I have learned except  the two to whom I have referred as having  been released. Elder Moroni Lazenby's lungs  were affected before he came out and have been  growing worse until I thought it wise to  release him. However, he has been very suc-  cessful in getting inoto the language and 
 favor of the 7th ult. advising us of five  more Elders to arrive here the fore part  of next month. We shall be pleased to   receive them, and a number more "5's" there-  after. In fact you may accept this as  an application for a number more than  intimated at last writing, as there is a  general demand for Elders pretty much  all over the mission, and particularly  amongst the Europeans. If things continue  as they now seem, I think we can, with  propriety, double our force which at this  writing, stands at sixty-one in number.    We are endeavoring to ascertain from   Presidents of Conferences, how many more  are really needed and can be profitably  used in each Conference. Will report the  number later on, perhaps about April.    It does not look as though we  will get the Statistical report off by this  mail, as some of the District reports have  not come in correct, and poor mail fac-  ilities require time to get corrected ones,  but will endeavor to not be later than next  mail.    A few Europeans are talking of 
 Sept 14 1897    Post - script.    After further considerations  I feel satisfied in my mind that Elder  Andrew Smith Jr. is the proper man to  take the presidency and watch-care of  that part that you suggest as being  known in the future as the Australian  Mission. and as you leave it to me  to make the appointment you may con  sider him the man that will be appoint-  ed.    His address is Newtown P. O.  Sydney S N. S. W. Australia. I will  at once notify him to that end and  we will confer together to the bringing  about of the proper division according  to suggestions contained in your letter  and our best judgement.    I see no reasons why the name by  which you suggest this part being known  in the future, viz: "New Zealand Mission" 
 has performed a firstrate work.    With kind re-  gards to yourself and co-laborers I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel,  E. F. Richards.

 emigrating with next company of returning  Elders in April or May next.    We are not preaching the gathering  to the natives, in fact 'tis with difficulty  that we hold them down and keep them  from emigrating. We are, however, encouraging  the old people, particularly the chiefs who  are just ready to depart this life, to work  their genealogies up and make them a  matter of record so that when they go they  will not take this invaluable information with  them. A number are doing it commendably  well, and some are forwarding their genea-  logies to Brother Hirini Whanga, Zion, for  him to do the work at once. Perhaps you   would feel like suggesting as to the advis-  ability of this being done to any great extent;  or would each tribe be apt to be more satis-  fied, in the future, to do their own Temple  work, when the Lord opens up the way for  them so to do? If not, it would furnish  something for Hirini to do, and that much  would be accomplished. ^Which I think is all right. J. F. S.^    Most of the Elders are enjoying first  rate health and spirits. There are, however, a  few exceptions, but we trust nothing of a serious 
 will not be sutiable and appropriate  and answer ever purpose. Will adopt  the same unless I hear farther from  you    Your Brother    E. F. R.

 nature. Many baptisms are being performed  and we feel that, in the main, the work  is progressing fairly well.    We had a little rain last week, the  first for a long time, the season having  been dry and hot, and to all appearances  crops will be very light, especially in these  parts.    A number of severe shocks of earth-  quakes have been felt of late. One, Sunday  10th inst, said to be the most severe ever felt  in the parts where it occured.    With kind regards to yourself and  co-laborers, in which Elder Castleton joins,  I remain    Your brother in the Gospel  E. F. Richards.    I hardly think we should undertake just  now to double the force of Elders in New   Zealand & Australia. But when the time  comes that the Saints & friends of the Elders  will contribute means to send the Elders  home when their missions are ended, they  should have all the[y] want. See 3rd page.  J. F.

 Auckland, New Zealand.  November 18th, 1896.    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    In addressing you a few  lines concerning the interests of the work in  this land, I deem it unnecessary to go beyond  President Gardner's return, for he doubtless gave  you a detailed report of it to that date.    Two days after parting with him at  Sydney, Australia, I embarked for this island.  Had rather a rough voyage, being caught  in a storm, having our upper topsail yard  broken, and the deck overflowed for two days,  but no permanent damage was done. The ship,  passengers and cargo all safely yeilded up at  point of destination.    I visited and held conferences in  the Hawkes Bay, Mahia and Poverty Bay  districts, all of which were fairly attended,  and, as we think, a success and product-  ive of much good.    Continuing on to this place I met  Elders Jedediah G. Casper and John H. Sargent,  on their arrival, Oct. 12th, their companion,  Elder Alma C. Lambert, having stopped to 
 Auckland New Zealand  Aug. 24th 1897.    Prest Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City Utah.    Dear Brother: We are in receipt   of your favors bearing date of June 21st and   July 8th; also draft for equivalent of $200  as reffered to in the former.    Elders Aldous, Hardy and Holbrook have  arrived safely and been assigned to their   fields of labor. Elder Bunot having   just met me when I received your request for   his immediate release, it was at once acted   upon; and he in connection with Elders  George Jarvis and Bryant Ashby left for Zion   21st Inst. Per S S Warrimoo. The former had   been in the mission little short of two and  a half years and the latter little rise of   that time both laboring among Europeans.    Elder Bunot learned prior to leaving  that his dear mother departed this life the 7th ult.    hence her desire to again look up on her worthy   son in mortality, would not be granted.   One week previous, per S. S. Aorangi, Elders   Hyrum Cook and Jedediah G Casper left   the mission to return to Zion. The former   having spent two years and a half among 
 Europeans, the latter about nine months, and   was released by his own request on account   of ill health. He had undergone a medical   examination and been told nothing short of   an operation would give permanent relief;   and that should be attended to without delay:   he wished to be at home with his folks to   have it performed. He had urine and other   troubles of an inward nature. He was pro-  vided with the usual amount £25 to get him   home but having been here so short a time   I was a little at a loss to know what wou-  ld be your feelings in the matter, and he felt   himself that it would be proper to return   it; and that he would prefer to do, said   he would remit that amount at the office S.   L. City.    Will forward by this mail blank filled   out of list of released elders as previously   instructed. Should you have any sugges-  tions to offer regarding filling out blanks   in the future I would be pleased to except   them.    We would be pleased to release seven   Elders to return by the boat leaving here fore   part of November next; and in order to   make neccessary remitances for return fares 
 labor at Sydney. They were apparently in  good health and spirits, and reported  having had a fair journey from Zion. Both  Elders were appointed to labor among Europ-  eans on the South Island.    A letter previously received from  you, stated that blanks would be sent by   the Elders for me to fill out on releasing  missionaries. They have not yet been received,  the last company of Elders having no parcel  for me or the mission. I will take pleasure  in carrying out your suggestions according to  my best judgement when the blanks arrive.    After assigning the Elders to their fields  of labor, I went into the Ngapuhi country,  which includes the Whangarei, and Bay of Islands  districts, from which place I returned last  Wednesday. The natives in those parts are,  as a rule, very poor, depending largely on  gum digging for a livlihood, hence very widely  scattered over the gum fields. However we  managed to get enough together at different  places to hold some fifteen meetings, besides  other house to house work, and were blessed  with the privelege of adding eleven souls to  our numbers.    The mail awaiting me on my return 
 Auckland, New Zealand  Wednesday May 26th 1897.    Prest Wilford Woodruff  P.O Box "B"  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    We are in receipt of your favors  bearing dates of March 19th and April 26th. Also  the Draft for £153 3/4 sterling. I appreciate the  information given in reply to questions submitted.    We are also pleased to learn of the pros-  pects of more Elders in August and October. It   would be to the interest of the mission if they  were already in the field, getting a start in the  language so to be better prepared to replace the  prospecting releases mentioned in my last to you.    As regarding the propriety of dividing the  Australasian Mission, I have felt for some time  that a move of that kind would contribute   largely to causing the work to progress far  more rapidly in Australia and Tasmania.  As the Maori people and work are of so peculiar  a nature is to wholly absorb one president's  time. And at the same time the prospects are   very encouraging, at present, in those parts, and   could undoubtedly be followed up 
 we would be much pleased to receive £100 ster-  ling before that time, if it be consistent   with finances on that end. I borrowed £10 ster.   of Elder George Jarvis and applied it on return   fares of the last company, giving him order on   you for that amount which I trust will   meet with your approval.    I am sorry to have to state that I have   just received a letter from Walter Baker Adela-  ide, S. Aust. dated 2 Inst which reports his   companion, Elder Thos Clayton, in a very bad   condition of health. Apparently caused from   over study and the [w]rong kind of diet. He is   said to be troubled with indigestion and   dyspepsia, and his nerves are somewhat aff-  ected, all of which makes him low spirited   and despondant at times. He was however   a little better after a special fast which   had been held for him. I have written   to be kept thoroughly posted regarding his   condition and if he does not get around rig-  ht away will doubtless change him to other   parts or consider the propriety of releasing him.   The rest of the bretheren were in firstrate con-  dition of health at last report, except that   now and again, one gets too fleshy out here   and is afflicted with boils. Most of them have 
 pretty well recovered from the itch.    Regarding the elders that it is expected will   come out in October but not stated how many.   We will be very badly in need of ten Elders   besides the three who have just arrived, to   replace those who have just left and who   we expect will leave in November. And   shall be much pleased to receive that nu-  mber as soon as practicable and if one of   them could be a competent book keeper and   accountant, we would like to be iniciating   him in to succeed Elder Castleton in the   clerkship of the mission as his time is   near expireing.    There are two or three places on the   mission where some opposition & bittter   hatred have been manifested. A Corps of   Roman Catholic Irish policemen made   some threats over the brethren tracting   and attempting to travel without purse   or script in Queensland but by carrying   the matter up a little higher the Elders were   guaranteed justice & protection, and this   matter seems to have pretty well blown over.  Now and then too, some minister has to   explode a little through the news papers,   but upon the whole, seems to me there is a 
 reported enough additions to make, in all,  some fifty-two, most, or perhaps all of which   took place during the month of October.    The Elders, as far as reported, at  present, are in good health and spirits, so we  feel that the Lord is working with us, and  abundantly blessing our labors. 'Tis not our  greatest trouble to get people into the Church, for  we have a great many fornication and adultry  cases to contend with in this mission, which  together with Maori Tohunga (sorcery work) com-  prises most of the causes for people leaving   or being put out of the Church.    Twenty-two Elders have already been  released and returned home during the present  year, and it is now expected that eight  more will return by the December boat, they  all having performed two and a half years  missions amongst Europeans, and three and a  half amongst the Maoris, which is perhaps  as long as any Elders are being kept out  now days, at least, so far as I am posted.  As yet there have only been fourteen arrivals  to replace those who have returned, which has  decreased our numbers some, and to a  certain extent crippled us, for the way the  Lord has swept away prejudice from the minds 
 closely with very satisfactory results.    Our last report showed a total of 21  souls in Tasmania; 22 in Victoria; 53 in New  South Wales and 82 in Queenland, total 178;  4 organized branches; 2 Sunday Schools and a   Mutual Improvement Association. A number of   additions have since been made in every place  except Victoria. There are now 21 Elders in   those parts, as follows: Tasmania 4; Victoria 2  South Australia 2; New South Wales 5 and Queen-  sland 8. Each conference president has, some   time since, written me suggesting the propiety  of more Elders. And in N. S. W. and Queens-  land particularly have pleasing openings been   made, and desires been manifested for   Elders, which have not, as yet, been respond-  ed to, for no other reasons than the lack of   enough to deem it wise to spare some from  elsewhere. I have been very anxious about  the work in those parts for some time, being   desirous of taking every advantage of these  favorable oppertunities as they present themselves.  And for the lack of sufficient time to visit  the Continent in person. I have recently been  led to write a general letter for guidance of   the European work and working Elders, with a 
 very good feeling among the people in general   regarding us, and what we represent. And   many are free to admit and comment upon   the great change that the maories in particular   who have embraced the gospel have under-  gone through our teachings and labors.   The Latter Day Saints and their religion seems   to be getting better understood and more   kindly looked upon.    Since first of July, I have visited and   held conferences and other meetings in Wai-  kato, Hauraki, Tarunga, Hawk's Bay, and Wai-  rarapa Districts having good meetings and   in most places made some additions.  July 11th we had the pleasure of baptizing   one Pepene a great chief of the Ngatimam [Ngati-tama] tribe,   and elder brother of our late respected brother   Reha Aperahamoa in whom we sustained   such a loss. Tis throught this one will come   to the front and contribute largely towards   making up the loss.    We have just closed a nice interesting   and we think profitable conference of the   Manawatu District at Porirua.  I go to hold conference in the Mahia,   Poverty Bay and Waiapu districts.  Ever praying for your enjoyment in 
 of the people, and inspired them with a desire  to know more concerning us and that which  we represent, it appears to me that we could,  with great propriety, increase our number of  Elders to a considerable extent.    President Gardner and I were united  in this conclusion after our tour of the mission.  If, therefore, the nine new Elders which he  mentioned, get here between now and the  end of the present year, we will have no  trouble in assigning them fields of labor with-  in the present borders where the work is being  carried on, and shall be pleased to get  twelve more here before our Annual Conference  in April. I can also indorse Prest. Gardner's  application for the two school teachers if it  meets with your approval for us to start a  few schools for the benefit of the natives.    Concerning the experienced Elder to be  permanently located at Sydney, if I could  learn his name ere his arrival, it might  act as a preventitive against any mistake over  here. It will be materially to the interest of  the mission for all Elders to take tickets  for Auckland, N. Z. except when differently ad-  vised in special cases.    Up to date we have received no tidings 
 in full of all the gifts and blessings  of your high and holy calling, I remain  with king [kind] regards to your self and co-lab-  orers,    Your unworthy Brother,  E. F. Richards.    [sideways text] E. F. Richards  Aug. 24 [18]97 [end of sideways text] 
 view of economizing our time, and introdu-  cing a more systematic and progressive  course, and thereby perchance make better  progress. Since its issuance I have heard  from a number of the Elders, who have fully  endorsed the move, and expressed themselves  as having felt, for some time, the need of  a more thorough and systematic plan being   adopted.    Elder Andrew Smith Jr., whom I men-  tioned in my letter dated April 10th, is 33  years of age, and has labored in the miss-  ion since Sept. 1895 energetically and satis-  factorily. Should you fully decide to divide  the mission, you may be led to either appo-  int him to the presidency of the new one, or   send an Elder from Zion whom Elder Smith   could labor with and assist in getting thoro-  ughly initiated into the work, while he   would yet remain in the field. Elder Smith  seems to be endeavoring to preach the Gospel  without "purse or scrip,"  and do his duty as a   servant of God.    Bro. Reha Aperahama, Prest. of Te Aroha  branch, Hauraki District, and an influential  chief, died fore part of this month. It was 
 concerning remittances for the company return-  ing in December, and as we do not get  another home mail in time for them, I have  taken the liberty of arranging with Brother  Charles Hardy for the amount, with a slight  interest, until it comes, which I hope will  meet with your approval. He seems a little  anxious that he should not be held out  of his money more than a month or so.                 Three Elders from Queensland @ £26.0.0 each £78.0.0      [Three] [Elders] [from] New Zealand [@] £26.0.0 [each] 78.0.0      One [Elders] [from] Melbourne   26.0.0      [One] [Elders] [from] Sydney   25.0.0      Total. £207.0.0      Money for return fares on hand 10.0.0      Tol. £197.0.0       This is according to allotments made by  former Presidents.    In the future what course would  you suggest for me to take, when there are  no funds on hand, a[n]d the time arrives for  the release of Elders, as I expect another  company of five or six to return home after  our Annual Conference?    With kind regards to yourself and  colaborers, I remain, Your brother in the  Gospel.    E. F. Richards    See over 
 a great blow, as he was a great support  in those parts and much respected by many  without, as well as the saints. Another   great chief of the Manauatu district, has also   died recently. He had formerly belonged to the   Church but been excommunicated.    A number of the Elders and many Maoris,  have a burning itch. When nothing else presents  itself they fill in the time scratching. 'Tis very  annoying indeed while it lasts, but wears off   in time. Aside from this the Elders are, I beleive,  in fairly good health. Elder Petersen's removal  to Mahia seems to have improved his health  some.    Since my last writing, a terrible storm  and flood has taken place on parts of the   island, notably Hawkes Bay District, where  some few people lost their lives. And thousands  of cattle and sheep, as also other property  damaged and destroyed. Very many are left  in a state of destitution. Pleased, however, to   note that none of the saints lost their lives  and but few were damaged seriously, as far  as learned.    With earnest prayers for your good, and   well being in your advanced years, even that 
 I fear it is not wise to send so many  Elders to those Islands. A fewer number  of men, well qualified to preach the  gospel and defend the truth would be  better. Elders without good qualifications  or bright minds should not be sent to these  distant and expensive missions.    The money £197.0.0 we will have to keep  before the Trustee in Trust or Presiding  Bp.rick until we get it. So many  Elders coming home so near together  will almost swamp ups financially.    Let us keep this matter before us.  J. F. S.    [sideways text] E. F. Richards  Nov. 18 [18]96. [end of sideways text]

Some years back, on this mission, it  was customary to place converts under covenant  on the water's edge, previous to baptism, but the  practice is now discontinued throughout the   mission.

 Auckland, New Zealand.  July 11th 1896.     President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    We address you a few lines   to let you know of the safe arrival of   Elders Ezra F. Richards and James   Steadman, on the 8th ult., in good health   and spirits. Since that time we two   have been traveling together, having already   visited three conferences, viz: Hauraki, Tau-  ranga and Waikato.    On the 15th Inst. we expect to start   South and make a complete tour of   the Mission, that Elder Richards may   get a thorough understanding of all its   workings. The Elders, as a rule, are enjoy-  ing good health; there are, however, one or   two exceptions, where the brethren are troubled   some with their lungs, and symptoms of   rheumatics.    During the month of June upwards   of forty baptisms were reported, and   prospects bid fair for many more in   the near future. Upon a whole, the 
 Mission is perhaps, in a fairly prosperous   condition.    A company of Elders and saints   expect to leave Sydney, bound Zionward,   on the 10th of September next. It will   also be necessary to release another com-  pany of eight Elders, to return Dec. 10:  If you will therefore kindly send means   sufficient for the return of the latter   company, not later than by the October   boat. We would also be pleased if you   can send us another company of ten   Elders to replace the above mentioned   company. Five might take tickets to   Sydney Australia for European labor,   and the other five take tickets for   Auckland, N. Z.    With kind regards to yourself and   Co-laborers, we remain    Your Brethren in the Gospel,  William Gardner  Ezra F. Richards.  Presidents of Australasian Mission.    We will have to rustle up some 800$ more   or less for return missionary fares, and some   10 more Elders to send out    J. F. S. 
 Wm Gardner  July 11 [18]96. 
 Woodville,  New Zealand, Aug 2nd 1894.    President Wilford Woodruff and members of the   First Presidency.    My dear brethren,    I take pleasure in writing to you   and reporting the condion and necessities of the   Australasian Mission.  The good work is progressing  nicely, and the Elders are reporting satisfactory results.  I am travelling continually, endeavoring to visit all   the Maori districts, thus aiding the brethren laboring   amongst the Natives, and visiting personally as many   branches as possible.    In addition to our Maori districts, we have now ten   European districts in which Elders are especially assigned   to labor in spreading the truth, and the work is being   vigorously pushed amongst the Colonials.    A new European district has been formed in the   North, with the city of Auckland as headquarters, and   Elders J. Johnson and Jedediah Goff are now located   there.  The Elders in Tasmania give a very   encouraging report, having recently baptised a few  members, and they are now calling for more help.    In the Australian colonies of Queensland, Victoria  and New South Wales, we have now eight elders at 
 work, and I anticipate good results from their   earnest efforts.  We have also two European districts   on the South Island, one of which I have recently   visited, and the prospects there are very good.    In view of these facts, I have just called the Mission   Clerk, Elder B. Goddard, to make a few months tour   of the colonies, visiting all the Europan districts,   and assisting & encouraging the Elders laboring in   the above mentioned fields.    Adjacent to New Zealand are the Figi, Chatham,  and Raratonga Islands, on all of which are large   numbers of natives, whose language is very similar  to the Maori.  The latter two groups are under the   New Zealand government, and I am very anxious   to get the work started there.    If it is possible for you to send a few Elders  who have a knowledge of Maori, I can use them   advantageously, in connetion with Native elders,   in opening up these new fields.    I recently received from you a number of pamphlets,   "Succession" by B. H. Roberts, for which accept our thanks.    These have been distributed amongst the Elders.  Elders Stevenson, Crow, Armstrong and others, who   left San Francisco, May 3rd, arrived safely, and have   been assigned to their fields of labor. 
 Wm Gardner  Nov. 2 [18]95    Auckland New Zealand,  Sat Nov. 2nd 1895    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother: It is now several  months since writing you from this Mission  and it is with pleasure that I embrace this  opportunity. Through the blessings of Almighty God,  the labors of His servants have been pros-  pered in this land, and it pleases me much   to be able to make an encouraging report.  The brethren, with but one or two exceptions  enjoy the best of health and all are in the   possession of the spirit of their holy callings.  In some districts, where hitherto the Elders   have been able to do but little, the Lord has   opened up the way, that now very effectual  work is being accomplished. In the month   of September forty one baptisms were report-  ed, and prospects are most encouraging  for many more in the near future.    I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of   $500.00/100, for the return fares of Elder Goddard  and Company. On account of not having  received money for the return of Elders Burton  and Barrow, I have been compelled to   borrow their fares from Brother Thos. Finlayson. 
 1. I duly received draft for £50.16.4, as per your   letter of April 2nd.  I used the one fare on hand, as   originally intended for Elder B. Hamblin, and paid   the return fares of Elders Rasmussen, Douglas & Gibson,   —£84.0.0 = equal to £28.0.0 each    2. I respectfully request you to forward me   two return fares for Elders T. L. Cox and E. Ellertson,  in case the latter has to be released on account of   ill health.    3. Will you also send me as early as possible,  another company of Elders—two for Tasmania  and four for New Zealand. Those for Tasmania   should obtain tickets through to Sydney.    This company is required for European work,   and the Elders should be recommended to equip  themselves with tracts and suitable literature.  If you can send a few experienced Elders  amongst these it would greatly facilitate the   work in the large cities.    4. We have great difficulty in obtaining tracts &c.  for this Mission and it is too expensive to print them  here.  Our funds will not permit us to do this at   present, as we have not yet fully settled for printing   the Maori Ready References.  We recently obtained   a quantity from Liverpool but they are all   disposed of. 
 who consents to having the money placed to   his credit in Zions Savings Bank; on the arrival  of the Elders in Salt Lake City. A letter with   full particulars as to amounts &c. will be   sent you by them.    Two Companies of Elders have arrived safe-  ly since last writing. They were all well, and   report the best of treatment and accommo-  dations. Some were appointed to labor among-  st Europeans while others were assigned to Mao-  ri work. They are all getting along very nicely.    Elders J. F. Burton, Jas. Barrow, and a   J. Ridges, have been honorably released to   return home, and have filled good missions.  The last though he has labored faithully   for more than two years, has been released  a little prematurly, on account of failing   health.    Elder Andrew Jenson has arrived in our Mission,  and invis[i]ting two Northern districts, we had most   pleasant times in Conferences with the saints.  On the 5th we leave for the South to make a tour  of the entire New Zealand Mission.    The brethren all desired to be kindly remem-  bered and are ever praying for the welfare   of Zion. I am as ever,    Your Brother in the Gospel    Wm. Gardner  President Australian Mission.    Good.  J. F. S. 
 Auckland, New Zealand  Tuesday Nov. 5th 1895    Elder Geo. Reynolds,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother: Elders John F.  Burton, James Barrow, and Alfred J. Ridges   have been released to return home and I have   been compelled to borrow money for their re-  turn fares, from Bro. Thos. Finlayson. £78.0.0.  have been apportioned amongst them which   should be placed to Thos. Finlayson's credit in  the "Zion's Savings Bank"; on the arrival of   the Elders. Be kind enough to forward   the receipt to me at your earliest conven-  ience.    Bro. Finlayson has offered to loan me the   money for the return of seven Elders in Janu-  ary, provided it be placed to his credit in  the Bank on the arrival of the brethren. Shall  I accept the offer? It will save the trouble   of sending the money here and also of having   it changed, with which is connected more   or less expense. All is well with all.    I am as ever   Your Brother in the Gospel    Wm Gardner  Prest. of Mission.    I think it good to borrow  the money as proposed.  J. F. S. 
 If you can render us any assistance in this matter,   with the next company of Elders, it will be a great   favor.  We need a large quantity of tracts, such as   Morgan's No1 and 2.

 Auckland,  New Zealand, Nov. 21st [18]94    First Presidency  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brethren—Your letter   of Oct 15th, and also a letter from Secretary   Reynolds with $200.00/100 enclosed came   duly to hand.  I am also in receipt of   literature sent by elders per "Monowai."  For these accept my sincere thanks.    The last company of elders reached   Auckland safely and had had a health-  ful and peaceful voyage.  After a few   days visit in this city, they received   their appointments as follows:  Elder   Browning to labor in Auckland a-  mongst the "Whites." elders Lasenby, Teeples   and Waters amongst Maoris.    There was much need of laborers for   Europen fields, but owing to the destitue   condition of most of the brethren, circum-  stances compelled me to send them a-   mongst the Natives, and that to districts,   which for the time being, were supplied.  However, from these places, elders will be   released to return home in April and thus

 leave room for those lately sent there.    Many of our brethren labor under the   false impression that, if they have suffi-  cient money to land them in Auckland   that such is all that is necessary.  This is a mistaken idea, as most have   from one hundred to five hundred   miles to their respective fields of labor.  If this were batter understood, much   embarrassment and inconvenience could   be avoided.  Those called to labor amongst  Europeans need more or less money as   they go.    Immediately after the Annual Con-  ference in April; Elders B. Goodard,J. E.  Fisher, E J. Palmer, and M. C. Nielsen's time  will have expired and if all is well they   will be released to return home. If cir-  cumstances permit, will you be kind   enough to forward money for their fares   at your earliest convenience?    The release of these brethren will ne-  cessitate the appointment of others in their   stead.  I kindly ask that if it be possible,  you send not later than by the "February Boat"  not less than six, that they may be assign-

 Kiri Kiri Thames New Zealand  Feb 22, 1894    President Wilford Woodruff  And Councilors    Dear Brethren it is with pleasure I write you a  few lines from this the nethermost part of the vineyard  to let you know how things are moveing in this  part of the World the Elders and saints are all  enjoying good health and spirits as far as I know  at present. Since Prest W. T. Stewart left on the 31 Dec  I have been traveling in the North of Auckland held  Conference in the Whangarei District the health of  Elders and saints is good and a good spirit is burning   in the hearts of the P[e]ople we have baptised 19 souls  and blessed 12 Children since Prest Stewart left that  is in the North we visited a good many of the  Branches in both Districts and incouraged them  to forsake their evil ways we were asailed by  Ministers and Apostates and the power of God was  with us so they could all see the difference  between truth and error and I feel that our  spirit will do much good, as many of the peopl  came in because their Chiefs came and the most of such  have left the Church and those who are coming in  at present thouroughly understand the principles of the  Gospel and it looks like the tide was turning again 
 in our faver as there has been a great many left the  Church in the Bay of Islands.    Dear Brethren I feel my  weakeness very much in asumeing this great responsibility  to Presiding over this Mission but I am willing to do all that  is in my power to help the cause of truth and trust  in him that doeth all things well I am one of Utahs  first crop and am a little behind in learning but I desire  to be found at my post till you can do better I received  the $500.00 return fare for Prest Stewart and company have  paid Charles Hardy $200.00 borowed by Prest Stewart.    After the  April Conference Elder L C Rassmussen William Douglass  and Westley Gibson will be released haveing performed usefull  missions as far as ^I^ could find out from Prest Stewart if you  can forward enough to pay thier fare Home dand I would  sugest that they be released to return Home Prest Stewart  said he would speake to you in relation to them and also  in relation to two experienced Elders to Labeor in  Auckland City    On ac[coun]t of my traveling around so  much the statistical Report has not been received yet  but I expect it tonight I am sure Elder Goddard  has sent it but my mail matter has been missent.  Our Conference of the Hauraki District will commence  tomorrow morning at 10 A. M. the saints are comeing in

 Auckland, New Zealand,  January, 23rd 1896.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother: Your letters of Sept. 12th  and Oct. 14th have been received, and I acknowledge  with thanks the receipt of $100.00/100 for return fare of   Elders.    A company of Elders has just arrived in this mis-  sion and have been appointed to their respective fields   of labor as follows:                 Jos. F. Derbidge Christchurch Amongst Europeans      Wm G. Park Sydney [Amongst Europeans]      David A Nelson [Sydney] [Amongst Europeans]      Robert A. Argyle Brisbane [Amongst] [Europeans]      George Burnham Whaigaw [Amongst] Maoris      Schuyler E. White Wauau [Amongst] [Maoris]     Elders Hoagland, Bartlet, Jorgensen, Petersen, Abbott,  and Nebeker having been honorably released to return home,   it became necessary for me to borrow more money of   Bro. Thos. Finlayson, for their return fares, which amounted   to £157.0.0. Please have that amount placed to his   credit in Zions Savings Bank, and forward the receipt   for the same by return mail.    ^Soon^ After the April Conference seven elders will be re-  leased to return home. This will necessitate the appoint-  ment of others in their stead. Please send a company

 of eight, on the March boat.  Select two Elders suitable for   European labor, and instruct them to purchase their tickets   for Hobart Tasmania. Two, also for European work may   get their tickets forSydney, and remain theirre. The others   may come to Auckland, New Zealand.    Our Annual Statistical Report will be forwarded   by the next mail.    The Elders and Saints throughout the mission   are well, and are in the enjoyment of the spirit of   the Gospel. It gives me great pleasure to report that   the truth is spreading in this distant part of the   Lord's Vineyard. The time for our April Conference is   fast approaching and we hope to have a season   of spiritual rejoicing. Our Northern Annual Con-  ference held at Te Aroha on Jan. 3rd 4th and 5th  was a most successful one, and we trust good   results will come therefrom    May God prosper Zion and all her interests.  Your brother in the Gospel,    William Gardner.  President Australasian Mission    We must raise this money if possible and   select 8 Elders for the March boat as desired.  If we can get this number to submit to the Twelve   soon perhaps they can be seen on time.    J. F. S.    [sideways text] Wm Gardner  Jany. 23 [18]96. [end of sideways text] 
 Christchurch Canterbury N. Zealand  July 8th 1895    President. Wilford, Woodruff,  And Counselors    My Dear Brethren  I take pleasure in informing   you of the conditon of affairs in this Mission.  We are all well, with the exceptions of Elders Stephenson  who has been aflected with sore eyes for some time; and Elder   John Walker from Huntington who has been Ill ever   since his arrival in the Mission, therefore I deem it   wisdom to release him to return on the August Steamer   as he has not been able to do any Missionary Labor as yet.  He is troubled with liver complaint. And his head and   eyes are bad, and he cannot study he will therefore Return   in company with some of the Saints.    The rest of the Elders are   fully enjoying the Spirit of their Labors and I am   happy to say the work of the Lord is progressing   nicely in this Mission. New openings are being made   and people are inviting the Elders to come and hold   meetings in their school Houses, in a few instances,  and nearly all the Elders are asking for more help.  I haven't yet heard anything in relation to the last  company of Elder ordered. Nor the return fares for   Elder Goddards Company  no doubt it will be hear   next mail.  It will be nesessary to release Elder   John F. Burton and James Barrows in the Month   of September. Therefore if you will kindly send 
 Tamaki, Hawkes Bay,  New Zealand—April 9th 1895.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Beloved brother,    I take pleasure in informing you that   our Annual Conference has just closed and we   have been blessed with an abundant outpouring   of the Spirit of God. In our Sacrament meeting   we had over 200 Visiting Europeans and   hundreds of Maoris came from all parts of   New Zealand. Thirty seven elders from the   various Conferences in Australasia were   present and the reports were highly satisfactory   and encouraging. The work is progressing   nicely in all our fields and we rejoice in   these evidences of divine favor.    A Company of Elders and Saints will   leave Sydney on May 18th for Vancouver in  charge of Elder B. Goddard.    X We shall require, as early as possible, eight    more Elders, to fill vacancies that will shortly   occur. Four will be required for Maori work   and four to labor amongst Europeans.    I also need an earnest experienced elder   to take Supervision of The Conferences in   Australia and Tasmania, with whom I 
 me the money for their return fare as soon as   posible; as Elder Hardy is geting a little short   at present and I am owing him £100.0.0 for return fare   of Elder Goddards Company.    If you can spare another   Company of Elders we can use them to an advantage  in the Mission ast there will be a large Company of   Elders ^released^ about the last of the year and the first of   the new one.    I am quite well and enjoying my  Labors very much. Ever praying for the welfare of Zion  with love and blessing to all.    I remain your Brother   and colaborer in the cause of Truth    William Gardner  Box 236 Auckland  New Zealand    At least from 500$ to 800$, should be   sent to bro. Gardner at once. These  matters, relative to Samoa, New Zealand  Tonga, Northern States, & Cal. should   be called up, and I think You bro.  George, as Secretery, should do it, and  I will assist you - J. F. S.

 could correspond continually as I am   unable to visit them. Elder Goddard has   just returned from an extended trip and,   will be able to report to you fully on his   return to Salt Lake City.    X In a short time it will be necessary to   release Elder Charles Peterson so please   forward the requisite funds by return  mail.    On account of your remittances   for elder's return fares being so different,   I am not sure what amount you desire   me to pay to them. I have only paid the   last two companies £25 each and if this   is not correct please settle with the Elders   at the Office. I feel impressed, however,   to state that many of our Elders, are almost   destitute when their terms expire, especially   our Maori elders who are compelled to   purchase clothing &c before they can commence   their return journeys.    Many of them also are great distances   from Auckland & Sydney, and in some   cases it costs about £4 to reach the   port for American Sailings.    I shall also esteem it a favor if   you can possibly arrange to remit 
 funds in time for me to settle with   the Elders, when their time expires as   I have been compelled to borrow from  Bro. Hardy several times of late in   order to accomodate the returning   Elders.    With kind regards    I remain   Your Bro. in the   Gospel    Wm Gardner.    [sideways text] Wm Gardner   Apl. 9 [18]95.

 President Woodruff said he was pleased to  see the people, the labor done, and the country he  was favorably impressed all around.    In regard to teaching the young as spoken of, he  said when a boy he was taught by Professor whose  Porter whose son is now Pres of Yale College. He  had learned to quote scripture quite well.  Was some prepared to receive the Gospel when   presented. Always had a desire to serve good.  After attending a protracted meeting when  about twenty years of age (and a miller by trade)  on attending a protracted meeting all was given  the privilidge to speak. His morale was so beat  on the work of God that he enquired of the minister  as to the gifts and powers of the Apostolic days  They informed him he would be a useful   man in society but, for those foolish notions,  boy speaker remarked that he wished those dark  ages would come again. It has now come and  we are a part of it. Bro Woodruff had spent   two thirds of his life connected with the princi  ples taught by God through His prophets.    Religion of Christ required union in prayers  building fences, church houses, ditches and  all the helps and organizations such as Releif  Society, Mutual Improvements, Primaries etc etc.  We should be in unison with one another.  All sisters should be members of Releif Societies  All young Brothers and sisters should belong  to the Mutual Improvement Associations.  So with the Sabbath Schools. The Lord organ-  ized these institutions, as well as the Primary  to stay for the promulgation of His truths.  These institutions were likened to a Nursery  There were forty thousand children in these  mountains to be trained daily. The younger 
 with primaries, elderly ones according to their  capacities. These institutions form our  character for eternity. For these we ought to  be of all people the most thankful for His care.  The eyes of the heavens and the earth are upon  us. We cannot afford to sacrifice of our hopes  of exaltation forever for anything upon the  earth. By neglect ouof our duties we loose spirit  of God—then comes apostacy. He would rather  die a thousand deaths than be devoid of this  spirit to cause him to fall away.    The doctrine of Baptism for the dead was spoken  of. It was a very important principle, so  much so that we could not fully comprehend.  Fifty thousand millions of people who have  lived since the days of Christ had to be admin  istered for. No people but the L.D.S. had that  power.    Celestial Marriage was spoken  of. The binding power of the Priesthood was  of inestimable value to all mankind.  Gave his observations in a pecuniary point of  view as to the ones who practice this law and  vice versa. While but one wife and one  child it was harder to get along, than when the  husband of several wives and many children.  No person would occupy a celestial position  without a wife. No wife would be found  ^L D B.^ in the Terrestrial. We should not fight  the Celestial law. But desire to obey it.  Lorenzo. D. Barnes who had died in England  as one of the first elders without priviledge  of obeying it this law would be judged accord  ^80^ ingly. The speaker would be eighty year  ^3^ old in three days. Had quit quarrelling lon[g] 
 ago. Husbands be kind to their wives. Wives  be kind to husband and children. Dont  scold, scold, and drive. These Ephraim chil-  dren are hard to drive. They can be lead, not  drove. Presidents Young, J. Taylor, Geo. Q. Cannon  and many more were obedient to Joseph Smith  yet such men could not be made slaves of.    In regard to Ppolitics, put good men in  office. [O]fficers work for the county good  and not feather your nests. Said that a  great immigration was sure to be the lot  of this Stake. Spoke forty minutes.  Choir sang "O give me back my prophet."    Benediction by President Gunnell. 
 President Wilford Woodruff   said we had met to partake of the emblems of   the body and blood of Christ. No Latter Day   Saint ought to be ashamed of being a follow-  er of our Savior altho he came on this earth in   a very humble condition. See how he suffered   bled and died, while at the same time he had power   to destroy those who were persecuting him. The prophet   ^39 years^ Joseph Smith while in prison showed his devotion   to God and his Christ, as witness his prayer at that   time recorded in ##Doctrine & Covenants 121-122|Book of D&C page 121-2##:    Altho the laws of the Jews did not allow one to   administer in religious matters until thirty years   of age, and was crucified about three years after  ^33 1/2^ See what mighty works he had done in so short 
 a time in organizing the church, performing   miracles, etc. He was a very poor man. Did   not have wherewith to pay his taxes until he   sent Peter to catch a fish with money in its   belly for that purpose. As Christ gave his life   for others, so it was to be the same with others,   Joseph Smith gave his life. It was necessary   for the Testator to seal his testimony with  their blood. It seems as though this was   to be the case from before the foundation of   the earth. Instead of having bad feelings   towards our enemies such as congressmen and   rulers, we should feel to pray for them. Had   followed President B. Young to the penitentiary   when arrested by order of Judge McKean.   Had felt at the time that judgment ought   to be passed on Judge McKean. Judge McKean   had passed from this earth as though a nother.    "Shaefers experience in the edict against   the saints, carrying sertain banners in pro-  cession, had gone ^on^ very short notice. Numerous,   other instances can be cited to show that   "vengeance is mine, and I will repay it saith   the Lord is verified."##Romans 12:19## Had seen the revelation   on the late civil war in the United States   twenty five years before it happened. 
 "I have resserved judgements for all my enemies"   has been verified all through the states of Mo.   That State suffered in kind, only in greater   abundance, the punishment inflicted by them   on the Saints while in their midst. It was   far better to leave justice to God rather than   take it in our own hands. This Kingdom is   set up for ever. The Celestial Law of Marriage  the highest law he ever gave to the children of   men. He will hold every man responsible   for his own deeds. Spoke of Joseph Smiths   prophecy to Stephen A. Douglas relating to   his aspiring to the Presidency of the United   States. When Douglas fought the Saints, by   declaration, he went down in estimation of   all men, and died poor. So it was with   nearly all the Judges, Rulers & statesmen.   God was attending to His business better than   we should. We should pray. Learn to be   prayerful. No man spends a day twice over.   We are making character every day. Be   careful how we form character.    Infidelity is taking the world. The world is   making rapid strides to overturn the religion   of their fathers. Knew Tim Ham at one time   to say that there was upwards of six hyndred 
 religions, all having different ways to heaven.  Tim said when they got there there would   be a "Hell of a heaven," the speaker thought so  too. Exhorted all the priesthood to be alive to  their duties and callings. A priest or teacher or  deacon had power with the heavens just as  well as an Apostle had. Prayed God to bless  all present and all Gods people. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff Spoke on the need   of working together to care for our stock, crops  etc. Beleived it right for a Bishop to go to   work as Prest Ricks had done. It was re-  quired at the hands of every Latter Day Saint to   be a worker in temporal as well as spiritual   affairs. Had desired when he first embraced   the Gospel, to preach ^to^ the nations of the earth.   Since that time he had travelled far enough   to go around the world six times as his diary   would show. The religions of to day can not   turn the hearts of our children away from the   Gospel that is with them daily. They propose   to do so, but they will fail. Live your religion   live to your prayers. Show me a praying   father, and I will show you praying children.   Mothers have great power over their children.   Their children look to them for guidance.   Said God would bless our flocks, herds   children, lands. The clerk then read a   circular to President Ricks relating to Temple   work in Cache Stake and its work and   programme of labors. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said Bro Grant   preached upon many principles this morning   that were for our benefit if carried out. In re-  gard to revelation, Joseph Smith was led the   most of his life by revelation. So it is in regard   to the living prophets and apostles. Jesus said   straight is the way that leads to destruction and   narrow is the path that leads to eternal life   and few there be that find it. ##Matthew 7:13## There were   Telestial, terristrial, and Celestial conditions   of happiness. Those who earn one reward will   not reap the reward of the other except yet be the   greater absorbing the lesser glory. The Celestial   law is unpopular, Gods truths were always so.   He said He called them out of the world, con-  sequently they were not of the world.##John 15:19## Gods   truths were never popular, as the fulness of   the Gospel is given to this generation it must   embrace every principle advanced before   time. Joseph Smith received the powers of   the two priesthoods: The keys pertaining to the   uniting of the dead to the living. The keys of   gathering the scattered Israelites from all   nations, and all other keys, knowledge,   power necessary to obtain salvation in   the presence of God and his associates. 
 The law of celestial marriage was one   of these powers. The world do no understand   us or these laws mentioned because they were   in possession of the Spirit they were given in.   We are not of the world, consequently, the laws   we are given are different. There has not a   person existed on the earth since the apostasy,   immediately following the Apostolic dispen-  sation that has administered with authority   in any ordinance of the Church of Christ, for lack   of the priesthood. There is no ordinance given   by the father to man but what is necessary.   Christ fulfilled the law of baptism to fill the   law. No man can ignore a law of God   with impunity. When the principle of baptism   for the dead, about twelve years after the church   was organized, was revealed, all felt to praise   God. We neglected to keep a record of our baptisms   consequently we had to do it over again.  The   law of tithing is imperative and must be lived up   to. If we do not, it shows lack of faith. This   principle is being lived up to better than formerly. 
 The Word of Wisdom is well to be lived up to.  Would not be over zealous in keeping any law.  Said there Ira Haines of Wellsville killed  himself by leaving tobacco unwisely alone. All  would be blessed in keeping Gods Word whether   of Wisdom or any other principle. Said a very  great Reformation was taking place for the better.  The Lord would not give the Patriarchial Order of   Marriage except it were for his benefit. The  law would exalt to the highest glory, as to the lowest  hell. There is no blessing without sacrifice.  The greater sacrifice, the greater blessing.  The blessing to Abraham to outnumber the sands   of the sea shore ##Genesis 22:17## with his posterity must have to  be lived up to in a future state. This law is   the strength of future greatness. I say in the 
 name of Israels God, there is no person, man or   woman who has obeyed this law but what will  be exceedingly rewarded for their sacrifice.    If you cannot gather strength to live it, dont  fight it. Leave it alone, that you may not be  lowered in what would be otherwise be your reward.  The history of those who fight this law among  the Gentiles is not to be sought after. All  who obey this law will be blessed. After the  passage of the Edmunds Law, had every son  of Israel took him another wife, I believe  God will would deliver this people. It take  a life of righteousness, as well as many wives,  to obtain exaltation. A man must treat  all his wives alike. No favors to one at expense   of another. Bear and forbear with one another.  When a man faithful man passes to another  world his work goes on. He labors for his wives   and his families until he attains exaltation.  There is a temporal blessing attached to the   living this law. My wives are each one better 
 provided for than I ever was before entering  into this law. So it is in regard to all the leading  men in the Church. So it always would be,  both in this life and the life to come.    Dont be afraid to obey this law. But be prudent  As the children of Israel would rather live up  to the laws of God than bow to Belshassars   God Baal and so receive His blessing. So  will the Latter Day Saints. Contrary—witness  the biography of the rulers, judges and great  men of the nation who fight this work   and you find their destruction commences  at that time. It pays to keep the commands  of God. The closer the Latter Day Saints live  up to His laws, the more we are blessed.  We are the finest people on the earth at   the present time. Young men, pray. 
 Priesthood—After the Prophet J. Smith hawas  placed in prison he uttered the prayer cited in  Book of D&C, page [blank space] also read the answer.  The question why did Oliver Cowdery and a great  many others fall? It was because they forgot  the power of the Priesthood. They looked to the  things of this world. Every portion of the priest-  hood has power with the heavens by faithfulness  I had the greatest power manifest in my  behalf when on my first mission while a  Priest. I travelled ten thousand miles in   that capacity. I went a thousand miles  with the prophet Joseph while I was a Teacher.  I say magnify your callings, deacons, teachers  priests and Elders. This is given us to magnify.  All heaven is watching over us. I thank God for  these Temples where we can officiate for our  ancestry. I wish the vail could be lifted  from the face of this people so they would see the  necessity of attending Temple ordinances.    President Taylor and myself are the only persons  living of the Twelve who received our anointings and  endowments at the hands of the Prophet Joseph  Smith in Kirtland.    minutes  77 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it was   indeed wonderful to note the moves of the work   of the Lord. The leaders of the Johnson army has  about all passed away, mostly in a summary   manner. The Lord has fulfilled a great   many revelations in the past fifty years.   I do not know of a single soul of those mobocrats   or their sons who have embraced the Gospel. I   speak of the Illinois and Missouri mobs. But   great were the trials of those States, and many   were their sufferings in kind the same as   what they inflicted on the Saints while in their   midst. Gen Doniphan had testified that   he had witnessed many of the words of Joseph   Smith fulfilled.    The prophecy of the   brother of Jared as recorded in Book of Mormon   in relation to the government of this land would   be truly fulfilled. [##Ether 4:4##] When this nation refused to   avenge the death of the martyrs, they allowed   their blood to cry from the ground against them.   They got blood, in the civil war. This people   would be a great people yet. They had God on   their side. The Lamanites would be a great   help in spreading the Gospel. Had travelled   a great experience among them. The first time   I spoke to one company they kept me till one 
 o'clock. They were very inquisitive as to their  ancestors. One old lady spoke and said  "When a girl her mother said that some white  men would come from the west who would tell  them about their ancestors. A great work  is being fulfilled through them.    If we do our duty, God is with us. Zion must have  room to grow. You are going to have a great  city here, a great country, be faithful. Go  This Kingdom will grow and increase. There is  a warfare between truth and error. Truth  will come off conqueror. God bless you, get  your work done that is needful to do. I  can carry a good report of you and your labors  and country. Pleased I came to visit. 
 Read    P.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus.  Feb 10th  1898.    First Presidency   of the Church of Jesus Christ,  of Latter-day Saints.    Beloved Brethren:    I write   you a few lines that you may learn of   the safe arrival of Elders Frederick E.   Barker and Charles D. Fox, on the 6th inst.  wWhen they came to Sydney. On account of the   missunderstanding of the arrival of the S. S.   Miawerra, they had no one to meet them either   by person or letter. aAlthough I received no word of   their coming still I was impressed there might be   some one or more. Elder Barker did not realize   any effect of Sea sickness. but elder Fox was   very bad at times and gave elder Barker to   understand that if the rough weather continued   much longer he was afraid he could not stand   it but he looks acceplright, and although   he was so bad, we had a hearty laugh after   it was all over and the pittiful story was   related to us. There does not seem to be much   sympathy extended to sea sick persons, as   very few die but the reverse they seen to   get so that many, at least, are better able to enjoy   their meals than before the ordeal they are called   to pass trough. 
 Elder Fox will leave 11th inst for Melbourne  to labor with Elders H. W. Barton and Enoch L. Reese  Elder Barton has been poo^r^ly in health for some time and  will be released to return to Zion as soon as we can raise  means or rather receive some from home.    Elder Barker will go to Brisbane 12th inst.  to assist Elder Wm Armstrong in the Queensland  Conference, and as Wm Armstrong will be called  to labor with relatives in the course of a few months  Elder Barker will, I believe, be able to take up  the lead of the work in that conference. am well  pleased with the elders sent, have been able to  place two good men capable of doing their part  in the possitions placed.    Some of the elders have had poor health  lately but when the hot weather is over, as there  is nothing serious in their illness'es, they will be  all well again.    The work is quietly making way into the  families of the honest and I believe we can look  for some fruits of the labor performed by the  elders. there have been, I believe, eight baptisms  performed and several children blessed since I last  wrote you and look for more in the near   future.    I am well and desire to do my part. I  go to Brisbane in company with elder Barker.    I hope each of you are in the enjoyment  of good health, and pray God to bless you. 
 and all you do; may it ^you^ be magnified in the   eyes of the people by the power of the Holy   Ghost, that they may honor each of you   as the living oracles of God on earth.   and may all obey the counsel you give to them.    May the Lord comfort each of you in all   your going out and coming in before the Lord ^Him.^    Your Brother in the work of the Lord   Andrew Smith Jr  Pres.    P. S. I send the address of Wm Woodcock  as I believe it will be a more permanent address.  Wm Woodcock 25 Toogood Street, Erskineville  two miles from Wharf towards Newtown. If  the elders were to go from the wharf to George  Street the main street of Sydney, and take  the newtown bus to the newtown Post Office  then go down the Erskineville Rd until they  reach Toogood St they will have no difficulty  in finding the above address and they will  send some one to look us up.  A. S. Jr.    Feb 12th [18]98    I was talking with the gentleman with whom  we do business at the Huddard Parker Co's office  yesterday and said the fares for the return to Portland  of our people is £13.12.0 all others £16.0.0 straight.    There are no particular complaints from the elders on this  Route, but many would like to return by Sanfrancisco.  A. S. Jr.

 We could put one hundred Elders in the   City of Sydney, or Melbourne, and there would be a  great deal for them to do.    I would be pleased if such could be the  case, that that number could be sent to Sydney.    To show you how little a few Elders are  known by the masses, Since the last opening up  of the work at Sydney, ^they^ knew nothing about  Elders laboring in Sydney.    There was a very untruthful piece  published about our people and we deemed it  wise to answer it, and the people were surprised  to know that we had been here so long, and had  been doing the work that we reported in answer  to the piece, and it took the Editor, (from the  surprise of our being here) several weeks to get  over what he had done and get on his  wicked head again to give us another blowing  up.    We had the satisfaction of getting  our Articles of Faith published and a few  good words of advise regarding our cause  and felt we had done our part without  slander.    We have at the present 21 Elders in   the Mission and could work many more if we   had them. The Elders are all enjoying good  health and are doing what they can in allaying  prejudice, gaining friends, and the Lords is blessing  some with fruits for the labors performed. 
 In the City of Launceston, Tasmania, Elders have  been laboring for some time and have met with  no apparrent success until ^quite^ recently. The  subaurbs are being tracted and the work is going  on nicely, there are about 16 members and  quite that number who are preparing themselves  to have the ordinance of baptism performed  that they can be properly initiated into the   true fold of Christ. There are some very nice  people in the Island of Tasmania and I  believe a good work can be done.    I feel that the Elders in this mission  are doing the Cause justice, the stamp of  love is written ^in^ the demeanor of the great majority  of them and is growing stronger with them  day by day, and I am thankful to our Heavenly  Father for the privilege I have of laboring among  such noble sons.    I also thank God and you that I have  been call to this far Southern Clime, and  that such honor is placed upon me, it is   something I never looked for. I like the calling  of travelling Elder too well to ask for any thing  higher but as I understand that we are expected  to improve, and if we prove faithful in the  exalted possitions we are called to fill we will  be blessed. otherwise if the office and calling is  desecrated, a curse instead of a blessing is given. 
 Answered  WCS    P.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W.  Friday April 22nd 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff.   and Councillors,    Beloved Brethren:    Your letter  to me with instructions (to me) as to what you  desire will be carried out to the very letter  if possible. I do not think I will be  able to leave Sydney before the 18th of  June, as the work to be done will keep me  here (in the Colonies) until after the leaving  of the May boat.    The agency at Sydney have not received  any instructions from Mr Coyle up to date.  Two mails have come since I received  letter from Geo. Reynolds informing me  of the arrangments made between you  and the agent at Vancouver. I believe the  changs^ing^ of the agency, from the Huddard Parker  Co. to the Burns Philip's S.S. Co at Sydney  has caused them to overlook the latter part  i.e. the instructions they should have sent  to Sydney. I have two men released from   their labors and if word does not come  before the next boat leaves it will very  much inconvenience them. If they have  overlooked it entirely I may be delayed  in my return, there have been two other  elders released to leave Sydney June 18th 
 Regarding the traveling to the different  conferences, they being so far apart, the  nearest is 500 miles Shanks povies are very   good but it takes quite a time and I  believe a great amount of time wasted to walk  and this would not reach them all, it is  an expensive mission for the size to do any  traveling. Prest Richards and myself were up  to Brisbane and were well paid for our visit  The cheapest way is by boat more time etc saved  The mission is in a poor condition to keep a  President if traveling expences are paid unless  he gets help from other sourses he will either  have to be content to remain in one place and pay  his way when he is able to. I would like you to  advise me what to do in this matter. I believe  if the Elders and Saints were visited once in  a while much good could be done and  would pay for the expence in time.    The following address could be given to Elders  coming to Sydney, Australia. No 30 Malcolm Street  Erskineville Sydney N. S. W. the above address is our  headquarters. Also I would be pleased if Elders  would enquire for letter directed Care of Second Steward  this will have instructions, as to what I would desire them to do.    [sideways text]  Cannot a furnish money from here to travel  [end sideways text] 
 Elder Barker is at Brisbane arrang-  ing the work in that part and will  be in Sydney after the 1st of May.    All being well we will travel together  making a visit at Launceston & Hobart,  Tasmania, and Melbourn & probably  Ballarat Victoria. After all business is  perfected between elder Barker and your humble  servant, I will make some inquiries concerning  some of my relatives who live in these parts,  who I have not had addresses of until the    last Vancouver mail, then I will be pleased  to return home.    I feel greatful for the ^your^ appreciation of  my labors in the missionary cause, and  the little good that has been accomplished  I appreciate, and in return I give our Heavenly  Father praise and Honor for it all. I know  the Lord has been with me in my travels  and work among the people, (Saints and strangers)  for my thick head would never have been able  to do the little good that has been pleasing  for me to look upon, then it was not me  it was the Lord, I being His humble  Instrument through whom He did the work.    With love for the work I am  engaged in, I remain a servant of the   Lord.    Andrew Smith Jr.  Pres

 Andrew Smith Jr  Jan. 26 [18]98    P. O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus.  Jan 26th 1898.    Wilford Woodruff  And Councillors.    My Beloved Brethren:    Several months ago,  President E. F. Richards, in order that he could learn  from the Missionary elders to a certain extent the   labors performed by them, formed a report which he   desired each elder to fill out immediately after   the end of each month, there being some time   during the 24 hours of each day that I have not   been given account of and which I thout essential  I have added more for the elders in my part to fill out.    There are some elders who put in very little time  and having something of the nature diagramed for   the elders to report upon. The president is able   to suggest where he would otherwise be at a loss, at   times, to offer suggestions or give advise to the elders, and   they having a form to work to can understand to a certain   extent the labor required of them. Some will average 2 & 3  hours per day. while others, laboring under the same circumstan-  ces average 6 & 8 hours and if we had no report given 
 of labors performed each month, many of the elders   would be robing the Lord and that possibly not knowingly.    The work of the Lord is prospering throughout the   Mission, although not many ^are^ added to the Faith yet. tThose  who have joined are endeavoring to serve the Lord and   are being educated in the glorious Gospel.    We have two very interesting Sunday Schools which   are attended by Saints and outsiders. also two very   interesting M. I. A., and the saints are getting grounded   in the work of the Lord and it does my heart good   to hear them bear testimony to the devinity of the   work they have engaged themselves to.    Some of the elders do not seem to take the council   of the inspired Servants at home when setting them apart   to missions. and there will be something said and done   if they, the elders when they come on missions do not leave   the girls alone and cease making love to them, there are some   here, and where I have learned of the same, I have given them the   information that they were disobeying council. and I could not   and would not countenance their actions. The health of the   elders is generally good. With love and best wishes for you and yours, and   all the Saints. I am your brother in the Gospel Andrew Smith Jr.  Pres.

 P.O. Newtown, Sydney N. S. W. Aus.  Sat. NApril 9th 1898.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  and Councillors    My Beloved Brethren:    I think  you would be pleased to learn from this part of   the Lords vinevard occassionally and therefore I   occupy myself at the present time, to inform   you of some of the good accomplished since   my last to you.    When elder Fred E. Barker arrived at   Sydney arrangments were made for him to go to   Brisbane, and Elder C. D. Fox who arrived with   him to labor as a traveling elder in Victoria.  I decided to go to Brisbane with elder Barker   and during my stay there I was taken down with  a fever known in these parts as the Dengue it   seems to be a complications of complaints in   the system, a number of the elders have also   been affected with the same.    The work of the Lord in that part, (Brisbane)   is moving along nicely, after witnessing the   ordinance of baptism performed, also assisted in   the confirmation. Organized a Relief Society with   officers and aids numbering ten in all. Ordained   one teacher, and two deaconcts, the M.I.A   being in a disorganized state for a short time  was reorganized, and introduced some ideas (new   to the members) in the sunday school. a good spirit 
 prevailed, and the saints were satisfied that the   Lord had a hand in all that had been done for   the progress of the work in that part.    Elder Wm Armstrong was honorably released from  presiding in the Queensland Conference, granted the   opportunity of Laboring among his many relatives   in N. S. W. Fred E. Barker was appointed to preside   in elder Armstrongs stead.    Several elders have been sent out to labor   where opportunity has been better given to spread   the work and warn the people.    Instructions have been given and arrangments   are made to hold conferences ^tomorrow 10th^ at Sydney, Brisbane,  and Launceston, and a good time is anticipated    I received the letter from Geo Reynolds, inform-  ing me of the arrangments between you and the C.P.  S.S. Agent, will no doubt learn of the instructions   to their agents in Sydney the 12th inst. would have   been able to tell you of the perfected arrangments   at this writing if there was not so many holly-days  here at the present time, no business being done   from good Friday until after Easter Monday.    I will acknowledge the receipt of the letter   from Bro Reynolds to me.    With love and best wishes for   you in ^the^ multitudinous duties you are called to   perform, I remain a weak instrument in the   work of the Lord.    Andrew Smith Jr.  Pres

 Old Cleveland Road, Coorparoo, Brisbane,  Queensland, Australia, April 18, 1898.    Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith,    Salt Lake, Utah.    Beloved Brethren:    Your letter of March 8th, apprising   me of the honorable release of Elder Andrew Smith, Jr., from the  position of President of the Australian Mission and appoint-  ing me to that position, came to hand to-day.    While feeling keenly the sense of my weakness and un-  worthiness thus to be honored with this important and very  responsible station, I feel very thankful to receive in con-  nection therewith your prayers and blessing, which I prize  above all things of the earth.    I have felt the blessings of God so far with me  in this mission, and I am now constrained to say  that with the same continued upon me (which I shall  claim, and believe I shall have, in redoubled measure) I  will do my best in every way to merit the confidence  reposed in me by you and to further the interests of this  mission, so far as may lie in my power.    I was about a month ago installed here in the po-  sition of  Pres't of the Queensland conference, taking the place  of Bro. Wm Armstrong, who went to labor at Sydney among  his relatives 
 There is a branch here of abt. 70 souls, and the care of   this with its various organizations (R.S., S.S., M.I.A., Priesthood meetings, etc.)  makes a field for considerable labor, vigilence and activity on  the part of the president of the conference stationed here. I  am glad, however, to have had the experience afforded me  therein, as well as that gained by laboring among strangers,  wherein I have tried to be fully active.    Some changes have been made, two Elders have been appoint-  ed to a new, and, we believe promising, field, and we  confidently expect some fruit of our labors in the near   future. This mission now presents an apparently   barren field, however, there being so much indifference to  religion in general and so rarely sufficnt virtue and  zeal to impel the people to even attempt to live a religion  requiring what the Gospel does.    It is my belief that later on we shall reap some  fruit in this land, though at present it looks discourag-  ing. In some cases Elders have lived in and tracted a neigh-  borhood for many months without seeing much good result, fur-  ther than making some kind friends.    There are a few good people now investigating, who, I be-  lieve will yet yield obedience to the Gospel message.    Your ob't servant and brother in the Gospel,    F. E. Barker.    Future Add. Newtown P.O. Sydney,  N. S. W., Australia.    P.S. I should be pleased to be informed if it is now contemplated  that in any case worthy local talent may be called to labor in the mis-  sion field as in assisting in tracting, etc., and if so in what manner   the call should be made.

 FREDERICK E. BARKER, PRESIDENT.    CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  OFFICE OF  PRESIDENT AUSTRALIAN MISSION,  NEWTOWN P.O., SYDNEY.  N. S. W. AUSTRALIA.    52 Burren Street, Erskineville, Sydney, May 22, 1898.    Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,   and Joseph F. Smith,   Salt Lake, Utah.    Dear Brethren:    There are now 22 Elders laboring in   this mission, two of whom are released to return home  next month, (June [18]98).    In case others are released after being 2 1/2 years  in the field (as has heretofore been the rule of practice) there  will be two more to be released before Oct. next, and three  during that month, thus reducing the number from   22 to 15, not counting any hereafter to arrive. Elders  Rudolph Korth and Jno. B. Mathias arrived on the 10th inst.,  and have gone to their fields of labor.    We shall be under some difficulties at once to  prosecute the work now under way, and could easily use  double the force now in the field. There are numbers  of places where I believe openings could be made to  some advantage, as where we already have one or   more members or friends. Elders who could speak  German would be specially valuable in some parts.    There have been four baptisms within the past month.    Your Brother in the Truth,  F. E. Barker.    Let us send from two to three   each each month until he shall be  supplied—at least with from  six to 12 Elders—one or two good German speakers J. F. S

 Br. Woodruff said:    The Lord told Joseph Smith  that he was laying the foundation of a great work, but  he knew it not. He felt this was the case with  these Relief Societies. Referred to the discourses  of some of our returned missionaries, both from  the North & the South. They all testified of the  want of virtue & of the degeneracy of society.    Spoke of the great labor which lies before  the Saints. The L.D.S. do not realize it.    Pres. Young is capable of instructing us: he  is called of God to lead. Zion is not yet es-  tablished in its beauty & glory. Spoke of our  children: noble spirits who have come here to bear  off the Kingdom. There are many spirits yet  to come: also many which are waiting for us  to do a work for them. Some men will  hear a sermon an hour long, & then go forth  & trade with our enemies. A great responsability  rests upon both men & women in this respect.    Our leaders are abundantly inspired to lead  us. Beleived that this people are advancing, are  improving. We are not going to stay here long, but  have a tremendous work to do. He should hate  to go into the spirit world & have his fathers &  mothers ask him why he had not performed  this work or that for them 
 Sundays past the assembly has been addressed by Prest. Kimball at  length in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothed  with the Spirit and power of God, so that he has freely satisfied   his mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, we  or our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified and  benefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowded  to excess during the evening meeting. Brother F. D. Richards & [my]self being  the only ones of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionaries   with the assistance of Prest. Grant, under the directions of Prest. Young  to preach throughout this city, all the wards during Winter have met  in the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the word  of the Lord. We have attended a meeting of some kind about every  evening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests,  Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confined  to reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism for  the remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood,  prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing,  seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani-  festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for our  blessings. Elders O. Hyde & L. Snow were with us during the setting  of the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors &   the Spirit & power of God has rested upon us in our labors. Elder  Hyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost in mass are  rising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the Reform-  ation, confessing their sins and restoring what they have done wrong. Meetings  are crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere is  sencirly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren &   live their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down vice &  iniquity in all the forms. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a few  of the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince & Co[mpan]y.  as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we would  also wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bear  in mind, the propriety of bringing with them or forwarding as they  may have opportunity any choice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will be  a benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedling  strawberries or any other good kinds Lawton's Huckberry, Calamba & Isabella Grapes,  Indigo or madder or cotton seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane or  Millet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seeds  and grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite a  benefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.    The Reformation is progressing thoughout this city and Territory with  great interest. President Young has given much valuable information and  teaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attend  the meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant on  the 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with his  counsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernacle  was crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter and  hundreds have to leave who cannot get into the house, the appearance  of Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months created  a sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for about  one hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to the  people, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the hearts  of the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful.  He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses will  appear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people for  several Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 Bro. Taylor,  I have named in my letter that I wished to  get the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel to  see something about it, but not knowing that he will be able  to do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00  and direct him to put up that amount, and send it to  W. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will pay  the money here in any way that you will order.    W. W 
 Bro W Woodruff said in regard to loosing are  friends they are needed behind the vail to assist  us in our work that we have to do for our dead  here upon the earth. 
 OFFICE OF  THE NORTH WESTERN STATES MISSION  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST   OF  LATTER - DAY - SAINTS.    NO. 104 BROADWAY,  3d FLOOR.    Council Bluffs, Iowa, 188    Salt Lake City, Jan. 4th 1888.    Elder Dennis E. Harris,    Dear Bro.    The health of Brother Wm M.  Palmer, who has been presiding over the North  Western Mission, is such that we consider it  improdent for him to continue his services in  the missionary field at the present time, espe-  cially during the cold weather of winter.   His lungs are very feeble, and have been much   impaired by his continuous speaking.  We  would like him to have a respite from the  labor of preaching, and therefore, in consul-  tation with him, have concluded to appoint  you as President for the time being in the  North Western Mission.    We have requested Bro. Palmer to continue his  oversight of the mission. We know that his  heart is in the work, and that he is familiar  with that field; therefore, we shall depend  upon suggestions from him from time to 
 2  time.  Whatever information you have to  communicate, however, concerning the affairs of  the mission, we trust you will send it to my  Office, so that we may have it there to refer  to in case we should think it necessary.    In appointing you to this labor, we beseech  God, our Eternal Father, to abundantly qualify  you, for the great responsibility which rests upon  you, to endow you with every gift and grace,   and to make you equal to every labor and  emergency. If you seek the spirit of revelation,   you will receive all that is necessary to enable  you to counsel the Elders, over whom you are  called to preside, in regard to their labors, and  that which is best to do to make them successful  and also concerning the organization of Branches,   Conferences, and opening new fields, and everything  necessary to enable you and your fellow laborers  to thoroughly warn the people throughout the states  where you are called to labor.    With love, and praying the Lord to be with you,   to preserve you from the hands of all your enemies,    I Remain  Your Brother  W. Woodruff 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE   CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.   OF   LATTER-DAY SAINTS,   GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON, OMAHA.    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. July 20th, 1889.    Elder William M. Palmer,    Dear Brother:    In relieving you from the responsibility of the   Presidency of the Northern States Mission, or, as it was formerly called, the North   Western States Mission, we feel that it is but justice to you to express our   feelings concerning the labors which you have performed while acting in that   capacity. Your services have been most satisfactory, and the only fault that we   have felt to find with you, if we were to attempt to find any, has been that you   have not been sufficiently careful of your own health and have exerted yourself   to an extent that we feared might undermine your constitution. You have been   exceedingly diligent in the performance of your labors, and the work has prospered   under your presidency. We have regretted that your health and other circumstances   have been such as to compel us to release you.    No doubt, the remembrance of your labors will live   in the memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the   memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the  memories of the souls who, through your instrumentality as a servant of God, have   been brought to the knowledge of the truth. 
 We ask God the Eternal Father to bless you in all your   labors, to give you strength and grace to endure every trial, and to enable you   to maintain your integrity even unto the end, that you may be crowned, with the souls   that you have helped to save, in the celestial kingdom of our God.    We remain   Your brethren and fellow-servants,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon   Jos. F. Smith 
 In [evmpede]    PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    GIBSON, MILLER & RICHARDSON, OMAHA.    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. Jan 4th 1888    Prest Wm M. Palmer,   c/o Bishop A. A. Kimball,   Kanosh, Millard Co. Utah.    Dear Brother:    Your letter of the 27th ulto upon the subject  of appointing an Elder to preside pro. tem. in the  North Western Mission, has been received. We do not  think it proper to request you in your present  condition of health to go out to the mission  and remain there, as you propose to do, if we  say so. Your health is of value to yourself, to  your family, and to the cause, and we think  you should take care of yourself and endeavor  to recover from the attack from which you  have 
 have suffered. Your lungs require rest, and you had  better, during the winter season especially, be  very careful about speaking in public, and if  you do speak at all not to speak long at a  time. We are well satisfied with your labors in  your mission, and hope that your usefulness will  not be impaired by any imprudence on your  part in taking care of yourself. It would be  gratifying to us to learn that you have completely  recovered the strength of your voice and lungs.  In the meantime we think it would be very proper  for Bro. Dennis E. Harris to act as President  of the North Western Mission for the time being.   We nominate him upon your recommendation  and trust that he will fill the position in a  manner to bring glory to the Lord's cause and  salvation to the people. We would still like you  to maintain an oversight over the affairs of  that mission and to make such suggestions  from time to time concerning it as you  may

 Feb 21, 1883    Joseph F Smith says that some  one has written in History that  the Melchizidek Priesthood was  not revealed unto the Church untill  1831 It should read that it was  not called the Melchisedek the Melchisediek  untill 1836 He also says that  the section 132 in ##Doctrine and Covenants 132|D & C## on plurality  of wives instead of readig that  it was given in July 12, 1843 it  should read it was first written in  July 12, 1843 for it was given in  1831.  He also said that it had been  published through mistake that Nephi  instead of Moroni had given the  Plates to Joseph Smith while it was  Moroni & not Nephi [##Joseph Smith—History 1:55-65##]    340 Miles from S L C to St George  226 to Milford ^220 +^ 120 ^= 246^ to St George 
 Feb 21, 1883    W Woodruff says that when  Joseph Smith the Prophet Received  the Apostleship with all the keys there off  He received all the Melekizedaek  Priesthood including the Patriarchal  office, and every office which belongs  to all the offices which belong to the   Church and kingdom of God on  the Earth. when a Man is ordained  to the Apostleship with the keys thereof  He is ordained to the Highest  Office Ever given to Man on the  Earth. W Woodruff also says  that Joseph Smith never conveys  any Idea that any other Man  Except Moroni gave him the   Plates containing the ##Book of  Mormon## He also says that  Joseph Smith declaired 
 that the remarks made  in the old Edition of the ##Doctrine and Covenants 119|D&C##  section 119 upon Marriage  was Printed By the urgent  request of Oliver Cowdery  against the wish of Joseph Smith  the Prophet, for the Principle  upon Celestial Marriage  was revealed to Joseph Smith  in 1831.

 Extract from Letter of General Clarkson,   under date of Oct. 16, 1896.    I desire President Woodruff and his associates to know that I   cordially appreciate what they did in this matter in anticipating the   payment of their notes. I know of no others who in these contracting   financial times have been kind enough to anticipate their own paper. As   I said in my other letter, their action in this matter has greatly im-  proved their credit in New York City. I could see it immediately at   the Plaza Bank, and Mr. Mills, the President, has spoken of it several   times to other bankers, and all of tyhem have said that they knew of no   other people or corporation who in these times, when money has become   the only thing of value, have anticipated the payment of their paper.  I   have given the impression that these notes were redeemed at $22,000, and   it is better to let that impression remain—better for my credit, and   better for theirs. I wish you to assure Presidents Woodruff, Conrad   and Smith of my appreciation in this matter, and of my unrelinquished   desire to be of service to them and their people in any way that I can   in the future, personally, socially, politically, or in any other manner   in which my influence or help might be of any avail to them. I have   great faith in the problem they are working out. I have had constant   admiration for the manner in which your people have reclaimed the desert   and set up a great state in the wilderness, and as great admiration of   the humanity and kindness constantly displayed in your religion. Espec-  ially pleasing to me is that portionof your church work and intention   which seeks to care for your people in this world as well as the next.   The industry uyou inculcate, the honesty you teach, the law and order you   observe, the ambition you have to serve your fellow men, are all very   appealing and influential with me, and the time will never come when I   will not be glad to serve your people or your Church in any way in which   my influence may fall to their benefit. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff addressed   the school, synopsis of which is given.    He was much pleased with the answer-  ing of the questions.    the History of the   church had been compiled consider-  able from his journal, he wrote the ser-  mons and prophecies, he heard from   the Prophet Joseph Smith, and had   kept a record of the travels &c of Zions   Camp. When he was a boy he read   the testament and bible and wished   that he could see a prophet of God, he   would have walked 1000 miles, and   done anything in his power, to accomplish   that object, he used to pray to the Lord in   secreat to grant him this desire, and the   Lord gave him a promise, that he should   see prophets. he had spent 45 years of   his life in labors with prophets and   apostles, and he with them would soon   pass away, and then the boys before him   would have to step forward as Apostles   Elders and Bishops, now is the time   for you to qualify yourselves for these   positions, I believe many of you will   live to see the Savior come,  and not die 
 but be changed, learn to pray, kneel before   the Lord, if your parents do not pray, ask   them, tell them Brother Woodruff said so   get a testimony of the truth, study the   principles of the Gospel. You are forming a   character that will stick to you, not only   in this life, but that which is to come, tell   the truth always, and under all circum-  stances, you are the only ones that are   taught righteous principles, we older per-  sons were not taught correct principles we   were taught that God was a being without   body parts or passions, there is no such   being, God is a being like unto Bro Young  and other good men, only he holds more   power and has greater knowledge.    Sabbath Schools is a good place for you   learn from the Bible and other good books.   we are living in the latter days, you have   Elders and Patriarchs to bless you, which   blessings are recorded, never quarrell, nor   contend, if you notice lambs, you will   see them play, but as soon as they are   likely, to hurt each other they stop, you do   likewise, I pray the Lord to bless you  your teachers and parents. 
 Apostle Woodruff, spoke of the good effects   of Sabbath Schools & Mutual Improvement as-  sociations, when he took a retrospective and   prospective look; he could see the good that   would be accomplished by the Young, there-  fore he was interested in the welfare of both   Schools & Associations, advised the Young to   be careful in forming their characters from   8 to 18 as it would govern there after lives in   a great measure also their future destiny after   life. Counselled all to not spend their time   in reading novels, but to read the revelations   of God, felt a great interest in the Revelations   contained in the Doc & Cov, also the Bible &   Book Mormon, had spent the past 9 months   with ^a^ people living in the U.O. and had   not heard an oath or quarreling in that time   had not seen them drinking tea or Coffee or   spirituous liquors, nor chewing or smoking tobacco   exhorted the teachers to give good and   correct teachings to the boys and girls, and   they in turn give heed to the teachings given,   there was no greater field of labor than the   Sabbath School, and Mutual Improvement As-  sociations. Death Was a seperation of friends   here, and a meeting on the other side of the   vail, births was a seperation in the spirit world   while it was a joy here. exhorted all to attend   their prayers & other duties.

 We are suffering severely from Small Pox  in Portland, in many cities it is proving  fatal — the Cholera is generally subsiding  and has mostly disappeared throughout the  county —    I certainly desire to feel thankful that  you have after so much trouble and per-  plexity as you have had with Honor that  you have at last succeeded in bringing it  to so favorable a close. it has indeed been  a sence of great perplexity to both of us  and I think make the circumstances and   for the reasons you gave, that you took a very  prudent cause in avoidng the law, for I  think that in no other way could you  have got so much out of it, and then  there might have been in this year a tax  expired before it could have been closed  up. it appears that you have done all in  the matter that it was possible for any  one to have done and I think that but  very few persons could have managed it  so successfully as you have I really  hope that this matter is now fully disposed  of and that we shall now have something  else to write about. As to forwarding funds  I think that by Draft, in Government funds  would be the safest way, it is a little 
 risky forwarding money for if it should  be lost it seems to be a total loss, but  if a Draft, is lost a [illegible] it can be  brought up in some other shape.    I am glad that you are receiving  so fine an income from the Officers of the  soldiers, in case the Indians trouble you  will not these soldiers assist you.    I hope you will not have the trouble  and expense of an other Indian war —    I wrote you a few days since  and thinking it possible that you may  not get the letter will state that the  Draft for $105 on Mrs Bingham was not  paid. Iwrote her a number of times on the  subject and urged her to pay but she  declined unless I would guarantee that  the money should be used to pay [illegible]  expense home to Connecticut. I enclose  the Draft in this letter.    When shall we see you here? I dare  not ask my when we may see any one else  of our friends here, but we hope to see you  once more. If it was not for the time and  expense I should be delighted to visit you.  I am of the firm opinion that I received a  permanent benefit in a certain ceremony  while at your place God grant it may to be so.  Mrs Carter will try to write since one of you this mind --

 OFFICE OF   Presidency Utah Stake of Zion.    Provo City, Utah, 3/19 1893    Pres. Wilford Woodruff   Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother;    I am directed by my father   to inform you as to the condition of his health.    For three days preceeding last evening he was improving   in health very satisfactorly, but while bathing last night   about 9 o'clock, in getting out of the bath-tub his feet   sliped from under him causing him to fall with full   weight upon the edge of the tub, causing a slight fracture   of two of his ribbs on the left side immediately over the heart,  from which he has suffered last night and today consid-  erable pain, though he is in as favorable a condition as   could be expected under the circumstances. We anticipate   no serious results from the accident and expect him to   be around again in a week or so if nothing unforseen  developes in the mean-time.    Trusting you are in your usual good health, with   regards from father and family I am    Your brother in the Gospel  A. O. Smoot Jr. 
 OFFICE OF   Presidency Utah Stake of Zion.    Provo City, Utah, Feb. 21 1893    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother;    My father desires me to inform   you of the condition of his health at present.    He has been confined to his room for the last twelve   days, the result, I think, of a cold he contracted while in   Salt Lake two weeks ago today. He has been able to sit   up more or less every day, but has suffered greatly   through inaction of the stomack and frequent spells   of faintness, which have caused him to grow gradyuly  weaker and rendered it impossible for him to get   refreshing sleep. Yesterday and today, however, he seems   somewhat improved, having slept fairly well for the   last two nights, and he has today eaten two very fair   meals for him without experiencing any distress as   a concequence.    As per his request I will keep you posted from time   to time as to his condition.    With kindest regards, I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel  A. O. Smoot Jr. 
 496 Elm street   New Haven Connecticut   August second ninety four    Mr Wilford Woodruff.   President of the Mormon Church.    Dear Sir    May I introduce to   your far-away self, a grand-daughter of   Mr Ozem Woodruff. (formerly of Avon)   Tis many years since, he joined the   majority. To the imaginative mind   Heaven, must, in deed, be a large city.   Opinions differ so radically, one finds it   difficult, to decide, as to the possible   destination, of those-gone before.    Two years since, I passed a number   of works, with my dear Auntie, Mrs   Linn Woodruff Hatch in her pleasant   West Avon-home. I became quite, 
 interested in you, and your, church work,   through letters to her, as well, as the   photographs of your old home, together,   with other places of historic note.   The photgraph of your self, I am sure   must be, a faithful, representation   of your kindly, face.    A recent issue of the "Boston Post"—  (Boston Mass) gave a print of the govrnor   of Utah, and a librl, of you, (ie) if your   photograph is correct. Also a brief sketch   of your personal affairs. The (Posts) article   suggested, the thought, why not take up   the acquantance. Aunt Linn, enjoyed so   much, I cannot hope, to make her place   good, for she was a veritable "Dorcas"   However, I will do the best I can.    (Considering the facts in life, thats about   all any one, can do). If, you have   sufficient interest, in-a good-many-times- 
 -removed-cousin, to reply. I should be very,   glad to hear, from you, providing, you   send a hand-written, answer.    Connecticut people, are such hustlers   they, do not have time, to show, common   courtesy. (even to strangers) No matter how,   private the business may be, one, wishes   to transact, with, these, educated, gentlemen   a-dictated-type-written letter is received,   whose brevity may represent, the "soul of   wit," at the same time, makes one feel   as if, they had been immersed, in an   orthodox, Babtist, tank-in-midwinter. I am   not collecting autographs, but democratic   facts, instead, are you, a politician?   Grandpapa, was a life-long-democrat.  When he was on earth, I called him   Grandpa—that wont do, for-94-so, we   spell it with a small g, and two, p-as  Were it not strictly, against, my principle   to apologize, I should feel, that I ought   so to do, for the length of this 
 introduction. Considering the number   of, generations we, must wade through   to prove the claim of relationship. I am   sure, the explanation, is sufficient.    Most respectfully yours   Nelly, Woodruff-Thomas    Address,    Mrs. A. E. W. Thomas   #496 Elm Street   New Haven  Connecticut. 
 Saint Louis   Sept 25 1856    Hon W Woodruff    Dear Brother    I am happy to acknowledge   the receipt of your regulurly Communication   from the "Historians Office" designed for   "The Luminary."  They have not yet   found their way to their rightful des-  tination from the fact that I have not   yet been able to recommece its publication   but they have afforded me much interest   and pleasure in perusal, and I trust   to be still favored with your valuable   Correspendence. And when I recommence  the Louminary, which I expect will be   in a few weeks. Your Communication's  will find a distinguished position, &   will doubtless be appreciated by my   subscribers.    You will have learned by my   letter to Gov Young that I was unable   to get up the New Deseret Type early   enough to send across the plains this   fall, but there is one Item I wish   to call your attention to -- and through   you that of the Board of Regents --   that is, what letters in the 
 alphabet will be most used in   printing?  And what will be the  proportional excess of those most   in demand?  It is very important   that this should be Considered   and determined as soon as possible   so as to enable me fill the order   satisfactorily -- or so as to get a Complete   font of type.    I have been fvery much occupied   with business since my return to the   States -- on my arrival I had scercily   time to look around me before I   found it necessary to visit New York   Boston Washington -- and I   have within the last few days returned   from Atchison & Florence where   I have been some several weeks    Brother George A is still East   but I expect him in a few days.  Also  Brother Heywood.  I have been too   much engaged with accounts and   preparing matter for the Mail to write   you a lengthy Epistle -- had I time   I might ^discant & pore^ advert to the Wars, -- polit-  ical entrigues. President making --   and other subjects now agetating   the Country -- but I must 
 close -- or my Correspondence will   have to lay over a month -- or may be   till next Spring.    You will give my love to   Brothers Bullock Grimshaw and   other Brethren in the office -- and   accept the same    From Yours Truly In the Gospel    Erastus Snow

No Elder in the Church has more cause   for Humility and Thankfulness towards   our Heavenly Father than your correspond-  ent. I have been the recipient of so many   precious privileges and blessings during   the past forty four years, that language   utterly fails me in giving expression thereto.

 OFFICE OF   The First Presidency  of the   Church of Jesus Christ   of   Latter-day Saints.    P. O. Box. B.    Salt Lake City, Utah ^Soda Springs, Idaho,^ Sept. 2nd[18]97.    President W. Woodruff,  My dear Brother Wilford:    I am glad to hear of your   good health.  I am informed that you con-  tinue to improve.  This is very gratifying news.  I read your discourse, delivered on Sunday   with the utmost pleasure.  I am sure it will   be greatly appreciated by the Saints, as it is   a powrful testimony, and especially so coming   from you under the circumstances.  The Lord   be praised for giving you the strength and   Spirit which you had.  My regret is that I   was not with you; but you had, and always   have, my faith and prayers.  I thank the Lord   that I live when you do, and that I have been,   and am, so closely associated with you.  It is   one of the great joys of my life to be your fellow-  apostle and one of your counselors.  I feel the   Lord has been very kind to me in granting me this   happiness, and I trust I shall never prove unworthy of   it.    My hoarseness still continues; but I   think my health has improved.  I hope to be back by   the morning of the 9th at the latest.  Accept my love,  my dear President, and give it to Bro. Joseph F.    I am Your loving Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon 
 W. DERBY JOHNSON, JR.^George Teasdale,^  COLONIA DIAZ,   CANTON GALEANA,  CHIHUAHUA, - MEXICO.    Personal    Colonia Diaz, July 5th 1891    Dear President Woodruff:    There being no Sabbath school this   morning I sit down to have another quiet chat with you. Our   circumstances are more comfortable than they have been. We lived   in a room 11x14 for some time. Then we bought the house consisting of two   rooms. The other room was 14x15 ft 6 in. When we obtained these two rooms   we felt we could breathe more freely. But when the summer came  and we were cooking in this larger room, it was so hot that we   were being cooked with our food. The advent of Tilley and her   boys necessitated more room. Se we built a kitchen and bedroom  on to our house of two rooms and now we are very comfortable  But building in Mexico is an expensive luxury if one has  the common necessities to produce light and air. In the Mex-  ican houses they have adobie walls, mud roof, doors and    window shutters. Very little if any glass. I think I have   discovered why. Three windows cost in Deming $4.25 four dollars  and twenty five cents. They weighed (58) fiftyeight pounds. The cost   for duties was $7.90 freight 58¢ Papers 80¢ total $9.28. A suit   of furniture Bed stead ^& wire mattrass^ Bureau, wash stand, 9 chairs & a childs chaircast $44.25  The duties were $227.2065. Freight $3.95 Papers & stamps $300 = Total $34.50  The first cost is in U. S. Currency. The second in Mexican Silver, which would   make the windows and furniture rather costly and necessitate   sustaining home manufacture. Building is expensive. Lum-  ber is selling at Diaz $42.50 per (1000) thousand feet Mexican silver. 
 Etty and the children have gone to Juarez on a visit. Jenny   & Georgey were recovering from the whooping cough and I   thought a change of air would help them as they had run   down considerable. We are having quite a warm time. The   sun shines nearly all the time and the heat is very   oppressive. Yesterday was the 4th of July. We had no public   demonstration. We have only a few men at home. So many   on the railway and away freighting. Those who have   stayed at home are doing well. Their crops look well   and their trees growing. I think in the outcome those who   stay at home will be the gainers. We ^have^ had new potatoes   corn, beans, and peas already. Meat is scarce, although we   have some stock men who seem to think they are rich  in cattle, but that is all. Very seldom kill any. Not   that we need meat. If we had it we would have to cook   and eat it or it would soon spoil. Our Fast Meeting was   well attended. It is almost like Sunday on Fast Day. In   the afternoon the Sisters of the Relief Society meet, and   we have a good Relief Society, some of the brethren generally   meet with them. In the evening we have a conjoint meet-  ing of the Young Mens & Womens Mutual Improvement Association  All meetings well attended and very interesting. The   Saints feel well and we take our schooling and exper-  ience as well as we can. We have some disagreeble  things to meet sometimes, and some get discouraged &   leave us. They do not give the Mexican Mission a very   flattering report. But those who stay seem contented   and happy. They trust in the Lord and seek His counsel.  This class are contented to remain. The health of the colo-  ny is improving. We hope soon to resume our Sabbath   schools & Primaries. It is wonderful of so many sick how few   comparatively speaking have died. I have had good help in our 
 Marshall Gleason came from Utah and   picked up Allsworth at Deming. I made   inquiries about him when I went to Doublan   where he lived and found the Presiding Elder   Bro. Jones knoew all about them. They were not   colonists ^n^or received as members of that branch.  Monday, July 6th 1891 Last night we held a Priesthood   meeting and it was determined D.V. to resume our   Sabbath Schools next Sabbath. Health of the Colony  improving. I anticipate going shortly to make   another visit to the settlements and organizing   at ward at Doublan. They are suffering for   want of an organization. Things generally are   improving. We have no trouble. The worst man   represented here by reports—Bro W. W. Galbraith  said to me not very long ago—"President   Teasdale, anything I have, you want, if you   will only let me know, I shall be pleased   to let you have it"—from what I heard of   Bro Galbraith, I would naturally expect to   have had some trouble with him, but he   and his family have treated me with kindness   and respect. Instead of pushing him off or   treating him with coldness & contempt, I have quietly labored   with him & preached the gospel. You thought he might   be made a useful member of the community and   you were right in your impression. We all have our   peculiar individuality and the Lord has brought   us into His fold, peculiar though we may be, and gen-  erally, the worst of us, can be handled with kindness   and consideration, can't we? God bless you, my beloved   brother. With kind love to you & yours I am as ever affectionately your brother   We all join in kind love to you & aunt Emma.    George 
 Patriarch Bro B. F. Johnson. We have been together   administring to the sick &c. He is a spiritually   minded man and has the spirit of his call-  ing. His early association with the prophet   Joseph and knowledge of principle makes him   an interesting companion. He is a blessing to this   colony. How glad we should be to have a visit   from you. We could take care of you and Aunt  Emma if she was with you and you could   have a rest here. The road between here and   Deming is not so bad. You would only   need to be out one night and then you could   sleep in a tent. The best rig in the place   would be at your service and willing   hands to take the best of care of you. And   how the children and young people would   delight to see and hear you. If you did   not like to travel in the heat of the day you   could choose a bright moonlight, as we   do sometimes and travel in the cool of   the evening and early morning and   take a nap in the day time a'la Mexican  for that is the way they travel. We shall soon   have what they call the rainy season, which   generally follows this severe heat. There was  a man & family here called Allsworth who   had the credit of seducing and running away   with his neice—his brothers daughter. When   last I went to Juarez I passed him as he was   going out to Deming. Now comes the word that    [sideways text] Geo Teasdale  July 5 [18]91  Answd July 30 [18]91 [end of sideways text] 
 Dear Brother,    I have received your kind favor   of the 30th of JulyAugust. I have just written   a note to Messrs Prime & Co, asking them   to send me a copy of their Catalogue   of fruit trees, and at the proper time I will   endeavor to procure and forward the cuttings   which you desire, though they are not   such mailable matter as those who enjoy   the franking privilege, are authorised by   law to frank.

 Wilford Woodruff Esq.  My Dear Sir,    Your kind   favor of the 31st of July has been received.  I am greatly obliged to you for your   kindness to my family. I have notified   brother Hautz of my intention to relinquish   my interest in the mill agreeably to the   deed or contract, which requires him to   refund to me the amount paid him. This   was a proposal of his own when I made   the purchase, if the concern should not   prove satisfactory. If however you can   get some more pork from him this fall  you will oblige me by doing so, for this   is a separate affair, and he still owes   me considerable pork. Congress finally   adjourned on the 30th ultimo. I am now in   the country where I shall remain until  November, and then visit New York before   I return to Washington. Very truly Yours  John M.

 On account of the length of work I am  afraid I shall not be able to prepare it  this mail, & attend to the many other  important duties devolving upon me.
