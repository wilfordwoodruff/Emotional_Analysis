This is to certify that we have had a representation  of the state of affairs and feelings of some of the Indians with you  and would recommend that watchfulness and care be used and found as far as principle possible, and if by watching there is a chance  to get those three Indians who stole the horses and still threaten to kill more into custody, it would be well to do so and have them  brought to this city, and have them confined in the Penetentiary. ^until the Presidency return at least^ we  recommend to have Enoch R. Dailey to  spend a portion of their time in watching around among the cattle  and herds to see that the stock are not stollen: and should it require any more let them be employed as herdsmen and watchmen and they should go armed, and inasmuch as they devote their  time to this purpose they should have their reward, and all men should be on the watch at the present time so far as possible.  We wish to avoid any war, fight, or quarrel with the Indians  as far as possible in the absence of the Presidency.

If on consideration you think it best to withdraw the petition and the committees or Territories and all other concerned will permit it and let it drop then it might be well to do so but if by withdrawing the petition it would not change the action of Congress But if they would still go on and pass Laws concerning a Territorial government for Deseret, it would be better to let the petition remain then to withdraw it if it made the matter worse all these things will have to be left to your own judgment and circumstances  Yours Truly W Woodruff.

But the day will come when all men will get there reward for the Deeds done in the Body. I hope and trust that the Saints through- out this land will not be weary in welldoing but sustain the general cause of Zion and each other by prayer, Love, charity, faith and all good works My stay in your midst on this mission has ben limited to one year But I rejoice much at the progress, prosperity and prospects of the cause during this peroiod.

But Brother Hornor whiclhe I realize that your standing in the Church and Kingdom of God as well as your high position in the minds of all business men who know you as a man of business, integrity, and honour all forbid any suspicions in the minds of your friends that you would  make any breach of trust by appropriating the money for any other purpose ownly for which it was sent. yet a delay in the matter creates a degree of uneasiness to know what is is come. I have thought it was in consequese of your Lamenets as I heard you had froze your feet and came Nigh looseing your Life which I was sorry to learn. if this reaches you in St Joseph I hope you will write me immediately without delay and give me a statement of facts as they are upon the subject ENDENTRY in building up and beautifying the land of Zion untill ^her deserts Blossom as the rose^ ^and^ her cities temples and towers point towards heaven as a token of the fulfillment of the promises of God unto Israel in the Last dispensation and fulness of times. It has been Highly gratifying to me from the beginning to observe the growing unions of the  Saints thoughout the British Isles and their willingness to abide by ^the^ council of the presidency of the Church and sustain every man in his office and calling. it is upon this principle and the principle of unions that Zion and Jerrusalem will be built up and be prepared for the coming of the Messiah you have also nobley responded to the call to assist in rearing unto  the name of the Lord a Temple as the request will show Also have liberl liberally attendesd to other appeals  that have been made unto you for which you will not loose your reward.  Elder Reuben Hedlock is again appointed to the respected station of president over the churches in the British Isles I have every confidence to believe that you will uphold and sustain him in his office.

I would Advise that the Saints sustain the Star and give it as wide a circulations as possible for it is through this medium that you obtain complete informatation Also use your influence to continue to circulate all our publications as wrote extensively for they contain truth and truth is mighty and will prevail Let not the Saints be discouraged because of the  Tribulations and Sacrifizes they are called to pass through For though the tongue of slander the press and wicked men send forth as us upon the wings of the wind a flood of  lies ^falshood^ and Bitterness against the Saints yet they will triumph at last, and God with Eternal truth will gain a victory over the Devil with his flood of lies and the Earth will be redeemed from her fall and Mount Zion will yet enjoy all those Blessings which have been promised her through the mouth of all the Holy prophets who have spoken since the world began ENDENTRY Before closing this I would advise the Saints to continue to keep in view the gathering. I have No doubt but that there will be doors open for the gathering of the Saints from this land to meet with there priests who will settle in Calafornia and by uniting together in wisdom and going by council much may be done in the continuation of the Emigration  Before closing this address I feel disposed for the Benefit of the Saints and gratification of the Saints to lay before you a correct account of the reciepts for the Temple Donations to myself in complyance with the appeal made at the Last conference Also the situation of the printing ^in which I leave the printing^ department in Liverpool ENDENTRY 42, Liverpool, Nov. 1, 1890.  Prest. Elder W. Woodruff  Dear Brother,  There is pressing need for Elders in the missionary fields in these lands, and believing that you are acquainted with young men in the wards where you reside, who are financially and otherwise competent to fill good missions, we desire you to send such names to us as you can honestly suggest, so that we can present them to the Presidency and Missionary Committee in Zion for their consideration.  Trusting that what you do will be quietly and properly done, so as not to create feeling when names are not acted upon, and awaiting a prompt reply,  I remain your brother in Christ, BRIGHAM YOUNG.

ELLIS; his logic was irresistable, and his sentences were at times arrayed in the eloquence of an orator who is conscious of defending the truth in the midst of opposition. The lecture should be heard throughout the whole United  States."  Of the same lecture the Salt Lake Herald said: "It is doing MR. ELLIS no more than mere justice to say that he is the only non-Mormon lecturer who has ever attempted to  do the Mormon people justice. His style of address is most pleasing and is calculated to hold the attention of an audience. His subject was handled in a masterly manner.  It is a lecture that should be heard in every town and city in Utah, and throughout the civilized world."  The Ogden Standard special from Salt Lake: "The speaker (MR. ELLIS) handled his subject admirably and com- manded excellent attention."  SECOND LECTURE:  "Utah Liberalism."  The Deseret Evening News said of this lecture: "The  lecturer showed and astounding famliarity with the history of this Territory from 1870 to date, proving that he had given the subject careful investigation.  The lecture ought to be delivered in other parts of the Territory, especially in the leading towns." ENDENTRY Kaysville, Feb 9th 1897  Pres Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City.

Elder Orson Pratt  Dear Bro,  The Eastern mail for Jan. last started, and went about 11 miles to the top of the first mountain, and returned, one of the party (not a mormon) having been froze to death in the snow, we have not yet received any Eastern mail for the past months.  Judge Phelps reports the entire fall of snow in the city up to the 24th. inst, has been over eight feet. We have more snow in the mountains than we have ever known since our arrival in the vallies. It has lain for several weeks in this valley between 2 and 3 feet deep. Many have brought their cattle from the ranges Northward, also all the stock of horses, cattle and sheep have been brought from the Island—as snow is reported as being nearly 3 feet deep there—and fed them at home, and large herds have been driven South into Utah valley, some cattle have died, but as yet few in comparison to what died last Winter.  The work of the Reformation is progressing throughout this city and Young has given much valuable information during this Winter to the Twelve and the people, the Spirit and power of God has rested upon him, and his whole soul has been filled with charity, mercy, long suffering, kindness, and a fatherly feeling towards his brethren and the whole of this people, and he has greatly desired their salvation, and his spirit has been cheered, and his heart made glad in seeing the people in a measure beginning to awake to a realizing sense of their duties, and begin- ning to feel the importance of magnifying their calling in the Priesthood and of building up the kingdom of God.

We have received the California Mail regularly up to this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.  The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the top of the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow, and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing thro' the most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex- perienced in the vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet has fallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has been for a month between 2 and 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands and more North. all the stock have been brought from the Island, and some from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, and some to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there has been but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter.  The abundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri- gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry for two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fall has sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had a constant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to gradually soak into the soil. The inabitants of this city have again commenced labor upon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and they expect to finish it by the opening of Spring, the inhabitants of Davis County have also commenced on a canal to take out a portion of the Weber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills andc.

Elder William Atkin,  Dear Brother: Your letter of May 20th is before me. I make it a point to answer all letters as far as I can as they come before me. My health is about as usual, except a severe cold that for a day or two deprived me of speech. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have been attending conferences of late. We went through Sanpete, attended the conference, and held nine meetings, and one at Nephi. We had full houses, and much interest was manifested. The sectarians,  priest and people, attended some of our meetings. We attendod the Tabernacle in this City last Sunday. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon spoke and occupied the time, as I was too hoarse to speak at all. All our crops are quite forward. We have had some fine rains; but it is getting dry again. They are beginning to cut the first crop of lucern. Concerning the Government I can only say that Harrison is showing his hand by appointing such men as Zane for Crhief Justice; and it seems as though he intended to make a clean sweep of all Democrats and put in Republicans in their place. I do not look for much peace in Utah during his reign. The "ring" intend to steal S. L. City at the next election; but it rather looks as though they wont be able to do it. My family are generally well.  Remember me kindly to all your family. Alice wish to be remembered to you.  As ever, Your Brother, W. Woodruff ENDENTRY and I would like very much to drop in to see you, but there seems very little prospect for any such an event happening very soon.  In regard to the "Temple Tank," I would like  to know where it is located, and what are  its dimentions. How long, and broad, and deep. How many gallons of water it will hold and all the particulars, as I have not heard anything about it to my recollection. I suppose it is to be at or near the spring, or source of supply, but I would like you to tell me all about it, and what it will cost. It seems as though you were working at great disadvan- tage while the roads and weather are so bad.  I have got over my cold, and am enjoying very good health, but the pressure of the times feels like a heavy weight upon me. But we are in the  hands of the Lord, and "He doeth all things well."  May the Lord bless you and your family and all the saints is my prayer. With kind regards I am your Brother, W Woodruff ENDENTRY I am your brother in the  Gospel.

Dear Brother: I received your letter of April 8th, but have never had a moment that I could answer it until now.  Brother Geo. Q. and myself enjoy our freedom very much. We held 12 meetings in three days in Utah County, and I had a very interesting conference on Sunday and Monday last at Brigham City. About two thousand of the inhabitants met us at the depot on our arrival on Sunday, and we had much of the spirit of teaching and instruction on our meetings. I start in the morning for Logan, to attend the conference there on Sunday and Monday. Brother Geo. Q. and myself have recently returned ofrom a mission to California, where we spent ten days and had a very interesting time, only I was sick three days. We saw a great deadl and a great many people, and traveled considerably in the State. We went to Monterey and north of the Geysers.

I am glad to hear of your prosperity, and that your family and sheep are doing well, and that another of your sons is married. I expect every- thing looks forward and flourishing with you. We are having a very early spring,  but a very dry time; scarcely any snow in the mountains. It is the dryest season probably we have ever had. Unless we have rain, the crops will fail in a great measure. We have no officers yet appointed for Utah. I am in hopes that when any are appointed they will be from outside of the Territory, which I rather think will be the case.  You must excuse short letters from me these days.

Press  of other matters has prevented me from answering sooner. Since then, as you are  aware, Brother Geo. Q. has regained his liberty, and is now greatly enjoying it  and improving by visiting and meeting with the saints whenever opportunity  permits. On his first sentence he received no benefit of the "Copper Act", as it is called, because the term of imprisonment was shorter than the law contem- plated for such benefits. But under the second sentence- 100 days- he got the full benefit allowed by the "Copper Act"- that is, five days off per month, or  about fifteen days.  In regard to getting a State goverment for Utah, I cannot see but it will be just as consistent for the Lord to soften the hearts of the "powers that be" to give the people of Utah their rights, in some small degree, in the form of a State goverment, as to soften them to administer the harsh laws they have made  to rule us by, in some degree of mildness and humanity.

Dear Brother:  Your letter of Feby. 3rd came duly to hand. Press of business has prevented an earlier reply. It is gratifying to hear that your daughter May is so rapidly recovering from her illness, and that the other members of your family are all enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. The tidings of the marriage of your son Joseph very soon, to two sis- ters, is good. It is right and proper for the sons of Zion to marry the daughters  of Zion, and through faithful, honorable and upright lives fulfil the measure of  their creation and their destiny. I congratulate them and wish them continual pros- perity and eternal happiness through fidelity to the cause of Zion.  I join you in the hope that not many of our poor brethren will be  great losers in the damage done by the late floods in the Rio Virgen, and that although the land which has been washed away is effectually lost to them, that they will make it up by getting land above, although they may not have to expend their labor for it. Even that will be much better than no land at all in lieu of that washed away. My family are usually well.

Elder William Adkin,  St. George  Dear Brother:  Your letter of March 24th is before me. I have not had time to an- swer it before. In regard to the water question for the St. George Temple I wish  to say, we have again consulted Brother Ottinger and laid before him the views of  Brother Thompson and yourself: and he says that he will warrant that inch and a  half pipe to deliver 435 gallons of water per minute, and that ought to satisfy us  all. It is as much water as we will need, and I trust to his judgement, he being so  well aquainted with hydraulics. I have written to Brother McAllister and Brother  Thompson upon this subject. I am glad you and your family are getting better. I  had a very severe attack two days ago which lasted several hours, but through ad- ministering, etc. I was delivered. I feel al^l^right to-day. My family are generally  well. We are preparing for Conference; we expect a large company of people. A  good share of the Quorum of the Twelve will be with us; and I hope we shall have a  profitable time.  Of course you know our city is in the hands of the Gentiles, and of  course they will take advantage of us in every respect they can; but we have to  trust in God.

Of course, I am glad to hear from you. I have just  returned from a journey of two weeks in the mountains. I came home almost a cripple, having broken a blood vessel in my right leg, which lames me for the  time being.  Now concerning our waterworks. It seems that there has been quite a mistake in the expectation of that piping. I have heard nothing at all from  Brother McAllister on the subject. I do not know yet what will pbe done in the  matter.  My family are as well as usual. I had Owen with me in the mountains. We spent our time in camp; did considerable fishing in the Weber river; caught some 200 trout. I did not catch a great many myself, because  it was too hard work to follow the stream. Owen scared up a very large panther,  and shot at and hit him with bird shot, But, of course, that is all the good it  did, so far as stopping him was concerned.

And being such, we would, in the event of the disruption of the general goverment, be independent of all earthly powers and clothed with legal as well as divine authority to assume the possition in the earth of God has designed or may design us to  fill in such an event. As Statehood seems to promise the readiest solution of  some of the prominent questions involved in the great problem of the hour, and no  other way  has as yet been manifested, it would seem proper for us to bend our  faith and energies in that direction, that, if it shoul prove to be the will of the Lord, we may be found striving for that object; and should it not prove to be the will of the Lord for us to get a State goverment, then would be justified  in that we acted according to the best light and wisdom we possessed. And in  conclusion upon this point, I may add that if it be the will of the Lord that Utah should become a State, "all hell will be powerless to hinder it," just as  you say, and certainy we should be found in accord with God's will. It is proper  that we should strive to accomplish His purposes, always acting upon the best light  we possess.

My Beloved Parents:  This being your  native day: the on which two such  noble spirits came into the world,  I feel it my pleasure to write you my hearty congratulations and greetings on this so dear to me, anniversary of  your Birth-day. Though thousands of miles  of land water seperate us, for  a cause not to gratify any selfish  desire of my own but to bear glad  tidings to the children of men, my  thoughts wander back to the warm breath of living Parents and I am  with, ^you^ if not in body yet in spirit. This is the third time your Birthday  has come and gone; or indeed the fourth  sfoince I met with you for this occasion. Oh how good it would seem to be  with you tonight! what joy would my  heart feel to spend this quiet evening  in the family circle of Home. Still I  would not complain as God has been  so merciful to ^you^ and spared your  ENDENTRY 3  affliction and was spared. To God be ascribed the honor, though the services of Dr. Higgins were had.  Wilford is living in the city, has quit farming, and is now engaged  delivering goods for Z. C. M. I.  The visitation of such a heavy snow storm, at the season of the year you wrote, is rather an unusual occurence for "Dixie," but none the less welcome to the farmer and owner of stock. Our winter has been open and dry. We are threat- ened with another dry season, which will be srerious for the farmers, as the  two or three past seasons have also been very dry. We have just had some very nice gentle rains, which have moistened the ground and will be a great help to  plowing and seeding.  It looks now, in view of the constantly increasing labors devolving upon me, as though I would not get an opportunity very soon of again disturbing the fish and game of the pond, as in days past; but in that regard my inability or disappointment will be their pleasure, no doubt.  Doubtless, the decision of the Supreme Court, for wich we are looking  hourly, will be a "mixture of good and bad." But we shall rejoice if any good  shall come to us out of thatrpolitico-judicial Nazareth. We will thank the Lord for any right that may be vouschsafed to us, and for all favors we will praise Him, ENDENTRY written in sideways text to father and Mother Nov 25 18905  Owen's Father and Mother Nov 25 1895 end of sideways text  Berlin, Nov. 25th 1895.

They brought Joy to my heart and  I felt thankful to hear from you again. It has been a long time since I wrote to  you last for the reason I have had no  letters to answer and have been as  usual overwhelmed with work. Am pleased  to inform you that Corlnelious Schettler has  been appointed to labor with me in  Berlin. I think it will prove a blessing  to him and I am sure it will to  me as my load of responsibility has been  too great and I feel some times about used  up soul and body. I am so anxious  that this Branch should prosper while  I am called to preside over it and not  having had proper assistance has made  my anxiety very great. There is more walking  and work of all kinds to be done it Berlin than in any other Branch in the mission.

It was  indeed a great surprise to me and  I fear you have done yourself an  injustice in sending me the last ammount. Am truely thankfull to you and what you sent will see me off in great  shape. Should have answered before but  have been on the go all the time and I know if you do not hear from me  very often now, we still have the  hope of seing each other in the near  future so you will please pardon my  tardy letters. Am having quite a  lovely time getting Bro. Wilkins off; he starts Monday and will sail on  April 23rd from Glasgow.

All that will make you  more happy and be of comfort to  you is my greatest wish and may  He who has guided your footsteps so  safely through the ruggged paths of  life let His guardian angles watch  over you through the day and guard  your pillow at night, that you may  live many years yet to be in  the future what you have been to  us all in the past.  I look forward with the greatest joy and  hopes that I may be with you to  celebrate your next Birthday. Many times I wonder how you will have  changed in my absence as I have been away so long the thoughts of  returning to you and Home seem too  grand to be real; but still I am  contented and happy to think I am  where you want me to be and  when duty calls me; here in a far  ENDENTRY 4  as in duty bound we should "acknowledge His hand in all things."  My family are usually well, and I am recovering from a severe cold con- tracted by over-exertion and improper ventilation during my recent visit to Utah County, where Brother Cannon and I attended twelve meetings in three days. I have never visited any part of Utah where there seemed more need of preaching the good word than in Utah Co. After four years or more of comparative seclusion, Brother Cannon and I had a feeling akin to that of young Elders or boys starting out upon a mission. I enjoyed it very much, with the exception of taking a cold.  With love to all,  I am your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY as life lasts.  Elder J. J. Toronto who has just finished a  31 month mission amongst the french-speaking  people of me  for about a week; he is on his way to  Cisily where he has  relatives. I was indeed glad to see him and  assist him in seeing Berlin. He has fulfilled a fine mission and rejoices in the good  work he has been able to do. On returning to Salt Lake I have requested him to call on you; that is if he gets home before  I do. It may be some months before  he completes his tour but will no doubt  call on you several months before I  am permitted to do so.  Cornelious has not yet arrived but I am looking for him in a few day; when he comes and gets a little acquainted, I  must go to Stettin and visit our Branch there and then as soon as circumstances  will permit shall go to to Soran and visit the good saints who are left with out a  shepherd on account of the persecution forbidding  an Elder to remain there. I will be glad  to get out of Berlin for a while after having been walled in for about four months, without  any change whatever.

The Route I have named  is not out of my way and I trust we  may be able to arrange it for Bro. J. M. Weiler and I to be released  at the same time and go via the  route I have mentioned. Of course have seen the Rhein but the Saints in Frankfurt are very anxious for me  to visit them again and it would be  a great satisfaction for me to do so. It would not be nice to go home untill about the first of May anyway  as  the ocean voyage, would not be  as pleasant, By Jove it will be  great to be tossed about on the white  caps again and I am sure I shall  enjoy my voyage this time. Well the good work in Berlin is progress- ing, we had a baptism Friday night  and expect some more next week and some  in the near future in the Sorau district where I have been at work. I tell you it makes us boys happy  ENDENTRY find a great deal to do. If all goes  well we are going to have a  baptism again tonight; so you see the  Church in Berlin is still growing a little. If any one in the world has  cause to be humble and thankful to God it is your son Owen for  when I look back is wonderful how  the Lord has blessed me while laboring in His vineyard. I feel to rejoice and  my greatest desire is to become more  worthy of the favor of the Almighty  as I advance in years. I am aware I  am but a beginner but desire to  lay a good foundation on which I  may build a solid house.  We Elders are having a good time together  and our meetings and labors are  attended with a good spirit. The weather is beautiful and the trees are  all rapidly putting on the appearance  of Spring.
