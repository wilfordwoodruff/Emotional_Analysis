 I have often wondered how a few families could  go out to day & start to make a home I would  be willing to make one trusting as the early  settlers did our only capital being our  willing hands & hearts coupled with the  advice of some of the old leaders surely we might  make a success of it & thus rid ourselves of  the curse of being out of employment cro-  wded within the city limits in the midst  of plenty & yet in need surely the advise of  Brigham Young was for seeing & good spread  out till the soil & God will bring the  increase now in the name of Him who  livest & reignest for ever & ever I ask your answer  to these my weak expression with your teachable  kind & christian advise in Christs name  amen    yours in human weakness  E J Goodspeed

I would like to visit your city and place my cars  on exhibition there, but desire first to receive  some encouragement, to the extent at least of  being assured of getting a hearing before parties  who would be apt and able to assist in promoting  the enterprise, provided I could succeed in  convincing them of its practicability.    From the fact that ordinary cars have to be rebuilt  on this plan, our chances will be much better on the  start, with those building new roads, and hence  ordinary new cars, and which must prove a great  public attraction. We are quite sure of  their adoption by the government for postal cars  as soon as their practicability is demonstrated.

 Doubtless you are acquainted with the prediction  of the prophet Nahum in which it is believed by  thousands of L. D. S. that our modern R R cars  are referred too. In my cars there is a  cushion which works automatically across the  walls and windows of the cars in the event of  collision which precisely fills the bill where Naham  says (##Nahum 2:3-5|2nd chapter##) at the close of his description, "They  shall make haste to the walls thereof and the defence  shall be prepared."    Doubtless of remember my father, John E. Page  one of the twelve of the early days of the church.  My mother remembers you as one of her  acquaintances in those days.

 Joseph Smith was to appoint a man. God said   he should not have power, except to app  oint. And that was not to be done, until he  was taken. Joseph done all that God, & he  said he should do. Again, Joseph did  all his part in planting Another. Again,  God & Joseph said, the Successor, should  be ordained, as was Joseph & Oliver.  See 43rd S, D. &. C.    This was all fulfilled to the letter. In the   call of James J Strang.    In all that have claimed to been, set up,  there has not a man, that has given  a shadow of Law, or logic, (but James)  that they have any claim or ever had.  God rejected Brigham & those that  followed him, & cast them out, & they  became, as heathen men. And they hold  the same relation to God, this day.    All the Temples, Tabernacles, & other  works under Brigham, or those ass-  ociated, Amounts to no more than the  churches or Temples of the Gentiles.    They had no Prophet of God. And surely  surely, The Lord will only work by a   Prophet. Such is my testimony to you.  And better than all that, instead of our  going to Utah & joining that Body, they  all have got to come to God & be baptized  by us, or those who hold Priesthood or  they will go to prison.

Permit me to thank you, Mr. Cannon and Mr. Smith, most sin-  cerely for your kindness which was only exceeded by your generosity.   The potatoes arrived in good order and we have tried them and find  them excellent. I have seldom, if ever, tasted better.

 It may be well to remind who you are  dealing with when you shake hands with  L. D.

And as such I write that you   & all that I great may find Rest in Christ.  I dont leave house, home & loved ones for  gain, or vain-glory. But wo was me  if I did not witness to you, what God,  by the prophets, & his Spirit had made known  to me, concerning the justification & [codta-]  tion of the people of Utah as well as all the world.  God by his prophet James gave the church   Revelation, upon Revelation, Before & after  you left Nauvoo. But you heeded them  not. Yet they stand on the Records of the  church this day. And you have to meet,  the fate, given. Your fathers drank the bitter  cup, & most of them are buried in a Strange  land, like the stubborn Hebrews, that Moses  led from Egypt, who died in the wilderness,  save Caleb & Joshua.

President Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Sir:    Sometime ago we forwarded a bill against Mr. N. Nel-  son to our representative in Salt Lake City, Miss M. Glassford.  Mr. Nelson was formerly in our employ, but left our services be-  fore settling his debts, and went to Sweden to work as a missionary  He wrote us from Sweden, an apology for so doing, but we think you  will agree with us, this is not the proper way for men to pay their  debts, and could not be used in licquidating any claims which we  may have to pay. We believe Miss Glassford presented it to some  of the officials who had charge of Mr. Nelson's work and they re-  ferred her to you. Through a combination of circumstances iover  which she had no controll, she was unable to see you at the time  she expected, and hence we have thought it wise to drop you a note  and present yout the bill. Miss Glassford has always spoken in  highest terms of her treatment in Salt Lake City and has assured  us many times that there would be no doubt of this obligation be-  ing met as soon as it was placed before the proper authorities,  and as we have exercised great patience in saying nothing of this  matter for so long a time, we trust you will show your appre-  ciation of this fact by giving this matter your personal super-  vision, so that it may be liquidated at once.    Will you kindly let h us hear from you by return mail, and  state just what we may depend upon, for it seems to us that the  time has almost come when patience has ceased to be a virtue, and  we feel the matter should have prompt attention.    This we feel sure you will give and hope to hear from  you as requested.    Yours truly,  R. S. KING PUB. HOUSE.    N.

You  hold no more priesthood from Brigham  & those who usurped authority with him, ^then^  did any man or set of that Joseph cut off  under God before his death. When you, (or  they) usurped & despised the Man God set  up by Joseph. It was the same God & priest-  hood that cast Brigham out, & off  that cast off Saul & all that followed him after  he was rejected, & David, the Son of Jesse was  set up on the throne. Saul made a great  fuss, for a while & abused the man God set up  in the stead of Joseph. [##1 Samuel 18:9-12##] So Brigham abused the   man James, yet God was with James both  by signs, & wonders, & proved to the church  James was the Successor of Joseph. The   work he done proves it clearly    The church is composed of a duly  ordained prophet, & other inferior  Quorums, all subject to the Prophet.  Hence you see clearly or may The   church never went to Utah. But a   [band pondues], set up, Brigham (not  God) & they called it the church when it  had no Head. But a man made hand.

 Copy'    Holiness to the Lord,  St. George Temple.  P. O. Box 531.    St. George, Utah, 28 March 1887.    Elder Heber J. Grant,  Dear Brother,    You asked me a question the last  time we met which I was not prepared to an-  swer at the time it was given. I have given  the subject some thought and reflection, and  I now feel prepared to answer the question, ac-  cording to my views. You asked me if I   knew any reason, in case of the death of the  President of the Church, why the Twelve Apostles   should not choose some other person to be the   President of the Church, instead of the President  of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know   of several good sound reasons; which I  will now give you. In the first place there  are two or three plain truths which are eter-  nal, everlasting, unchangeable, and immovable,  as the pillars of Heaven, as far as this Dis-  pensation is concerned; which have been  established by the Revelations of God through  the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These  truths stare us in the face. First: When the

 DISCOURSE  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Sunday  morning, Dec. 27, 1857    -[REPORTED BY J. V. LONG ]-    It seems to fall to my lot to occupy a few mo-  ments this morning, and I feel to say that this is   a blessed place, and that this is a blessed people,  and that they are partaking of a great many bles-  sed things.    If the Latter Day Saints could prize and com-  prehend the blessings that are given unto them,  and if our minds were enlightened continually by  the Holy Spirit, we should feel ourselves blest, and  comprehend that we are made partakers of the   greatest blessings which the Lord imparts unto   the children of men, I may say far greater than  the rest of our fellow creatures who now inhabit  this earth.    The Lord says, whosoever are quickened by a   portion of the celestial spirit and abide a celestial   law they shall inherit a celestial glory; whosoever   are quickened by a terrestrial spirit shall inherit a  terrestrial glory. I realize this, and consider that  the Lord has revealed unto us the celestial law,  that is, he has given unto us the fulness of the   gospel of Jesus Christ, and has given us a know-  ledge of the principles of eternal life. The Lord   reveals truth unto the children of men, by which  truth we are to be qualified and prepared for ex-  altation. Truth has been presented in its simpli-  city so that it might be comprehended by the sons  of men.    As I reflect this morning upon the condition of   the human family, and consider how differently we   are situated from the masses of mankind, I do feel   that we ought to be grateful to our great Benefac-  tor. There are millions of the human family who   assemble in various houses, in cathedrals, churches  and chapels for the purpose of worshipping God,  but is there one of those numerous congregations   who come together with an understanding of the  truth, except there be some Latter Day Saint El-  der who is called to preach to the inhabitants of  the earth? Do they come together understanding   the principles of the same gospel, the same plan of  salvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ, in a way and  manner to make them one?    Now, God could not make a people one with so   many kinds of faith and such a multiplicity of doc-  trines, diametrically opposed to each other, as ex-  ist in the world, but we are a blessed people, we   have the principles of union and oneness with us,  and by carrying them out, they bind us together   and make us one.    It is upon this principle that the Latter Day  Saints are blest, and made free. We are deliver-  ed in a great measure from those troubles and  perplexities, false doctrines, the darkness, the error  and superstition by which our minds have been  beclouded until the light has made manifest unto  the children of men that they were in darkness, for  this was the case with us all; until the light came  we were groveling in the dark, in a great measure.   Though we might be honest, and we might be ac-  tuated by the best and holiest feelings, yet, until   the fulness of the Gospel was revealed, the world  were like the blind groping for the wall. We had   no Apostles, no Prophets, we had no inspired men  to rise up and tell us what to do to be saved, and  we had to go through with all that trouble, misery  and darkness to which the children of men are sub-  ject while living under false doctrines, false tra-  ditions, and false teachers.    I have frequently remarked in my life, and I   was sincere in the sentiment in saying that I  would rather take a six months' tour in the pen-  itentiary than to go through with a six months'  conviction and conversion in the sectarian world,   according to their order of doing business. Let  any man go through the ordeal of six months' con-  viction and conversion in the Presbyterian church  and then be made acquainted with the true plan of  salvation, and he will feel about as I do upon the   subject.    Read the history of any man, and read his ex-  perience in the religious world and you will find   that it is worse, as far as the affliction of the soul   is concerned, than as long a time in the peniten-  tiary. We will take a Presbyterian revival, a man  is called by the sectarian excitement to get reli-  gion; he goes to the clergy,I do not care whether  it is in a synod, or in any other place, but suppose  that he has a great desire to seek after the plan  and principles of salvation, and he applies to the  clergy, they will tell him like this: you must sur-  render yourself to the Lord. He goes to work to   pray and fast, and he is faithful and diligent in  trying to give his heart to the Lord, but he is still  in trouble, and he goes to the priest and informs  him of his situation, and the priest tells him all the  time, you must give your heart unto God, you   must be willing to be damned and to suffer all  things for the sake of Christ. The minister still  pleads with him to submit himself to God, but he  does not tell him the first step which he ought to  take in order to have his sins forgiven and obtain  salvation, but tells him continually that he must   do it, that he must give his heart to God. The  result is that the man mourns and weeps, and by  and bye he thinks that he has committed the un-  pardonable sin, and he gets so that he thinks   it is the worst sin that he can commit to pray   when going through these feelings and this trial.    I have read the history of many strong minded  men, and besides this I know my own history and  experience, I know the way the children of men  suffer in attempting to give their hearts unto God,  and as I have said, as far as the feelings of the   children of men are concerned, it would not be  grieving their feelings any more in bearing the re-  proach of their neighbors to be sent to prison for  crime, than some men have endured in getting re-  ligion.    What is the reason of all this? It is because  they have not the same law, because there is not  any man inspired to rise up and teach them the   way to be saved: no Apostle to teach the gospel  of Jesus Christ.    Now in the midst of these trials and tribulations  many of you can remember how many nights and  days you have spent in suffering and distress, try-  ing to give your hearts to God. And when you   have been called into the circle of ministers have  they not called upon you again and again to come  to the anxious bench and get religion? I can well   remember it, although I never joined any church   at all until I joined the Latter Day Saints, but yet  I attended meetings, and I have been called upon  day after day and night after night to give my  heart to God, so much so that I would get mad,  to be told to do a thing so many times that I was  all the time trying to do, for I had a desire to do   that which was right, but did not know how to   take the first step, and those who taught could  not tell me how.    Now had there been an Apostle there to have  said, 'go and repent, be baptized for the remission  of your sins, and then I will lay my hands upon   you that you may receive the Holy Ghost, which  will lead and guide you into all truth, it will en-  lighten your mind in relation to the principles of  eternal life, and it will show you things past, pre-  sent and to come;' how easy this would have been  providing a man inspired of God had been there.    In relation to these things this people are truly   blest, but the world are in worse darkness than   they were before Joseph Smith received revela-  tion from heaven. They have gone into thicker  darkness, for the gospel has been offered to the  children of men, to the most of the Christian na-  tions during the last twenty-five years, and in a   great measure they have rejected it, but before   the light came to them they did not know what to   do, for the world were bound up in ignorance,   darkness, and by false traditions, false principles  and false teachers who gave unto the children of  men their erroneous opinions for doctrines of sal-  vation.    We are liberated from these things, the cloud   of darkness is taken from us, and the light of eter-  nal truth has begun to shine upon our minds.    Some of this assembly have embraced this gos-  pel in foreign countries, and many of us in this  our native land, and now we have all come togeth-  er to hear preaching, exhortation, and receive in-  struction in the things of God, and we have come  expecting to hear the truth and in this we have   not been disappointed, for we do hear the truth  from this stand; we have been taught the pure   principles of virtue and righteousness by the serv-  ants of God.    The knowledge we have received has taken  from us those troubles of mind and soul, and those   distressing feelings which were occasioned by   those false doctrines and traditions that were im-  planted in our minds in early life, and that have  caused us so much suffering in days that are gone.   Then I say it is a great blessing that God has  given unto us the celestial law, the principles of  the Gospel that will lead to celestial glory and eter-  nal lives.    The Lord has for years past been continually   revealing the simple principles that will bring us   back into the presence of our Heavenly Father,  and which will give unto us a place in his celestial   kingdom, if we abide a celestial law.    We can all see the effects of the establishment   of the church and kingdom of God upon the earth,  and we perceive that the effects of the gospel are  very different from false tradition, and from sec-  tarian absurdities that deluge the world. The re-  quirement is that men shall abide the celestial law   of God, in order that they may be quickened by  that power and be united by those principles with  the Apostles and Prophets, and all those beings   who have been quickened by it in ages that are   gone, and dwell in the light and presence of God,   and be forever in the society of the city of Enoch   and our brethren who have gone before us, and   who have been made perfect by the same gospel   which we have received.    If we were to go into the celestial world we  should then be actuated by the spirit that predom-  inates there, and have continually with us those   principles by which we should be governed. We  have got to possess the same spirit and principles  in this world, and we have got to abide a celestial   law here and be united upon the principle that un-  ites the people of God who dwell in his presence,  in order to get the same glory that they enjoy.    These are the principles that are taught us from  day to day, and we must learn to carry them out,  and we must lay aside our selfishness and all false   principles that we have imbibed and that have  been taught us from our infancy, in order that we  may obtain the blessings and power of God.    It is different with us from what it is and will   be with the children of this people. As one of the  old Prophets said, speaking of the gathering in the  last days, when they would come together, wake   up from their drowsiness, get to understand prin-  ciple, and see their true position, they will say,   'Surely our fathers have inherited lies, and things  wherein there is no profit.' And it is truly so,  for we can already say that our fathers have in-  herited lies, and we have inherited many of their   traditions.    Until we heard the fulness of the gospel we  were filled with traditions and false doctrines and   the teachers of the day did not instruct men to  walk in the same path, but they were continually  teaching something that would divide men in their  feelings, and that would produce as many differ-  ent creeds and schisms as there were sects in the  world, and hence we have all the evils attendant   upon that course of life.    This puts me in mind of a circumstance that   happened when I was preaching in Kentucky. I  preached upon the first principles of the gospel,  and at the close of my discourse I gave the priv-  ilege for any one to ask questions, or to make re-  marks if they felt so disposed. A gentleman arose  and I noticed that a great many of the congrega-  tion began to laugh, and I afterwards learned that   the gentleman was an infidel, and hence the con-  gregation were disposed to make fun of him. He  said, 'I will not detain you long, but I wish to state   to this large congregation that Mr. Woodruff has   taught me more this evening than I ever learned  in my whole life before. From my boyhood I  have been searching into religion, and when I  have asked a minister in relation to the way of  life, he would point me to the way he was walk-  ing himself; then I would ask another, and he   would point out a different way; and I might have   asked a hundred, and they would all have pointed   out a different road, and they would tell me that   I must be born again. I observed men who were  said to be born again, and one class of men who  were said to be born again would take one way  and another would take quite a different road, and  I always marveled at this, for I did not see any   sense in men taking different roads to lead to the   kingdom of heaven, but now this man, Mr. Wood-  ruff, has told me the truth, and shown me the   reason they took so many different roads after  they were born again, and the reason is because  they were all born BLIND.'    This in reality is the case, for many of us have  been born again according to the traditions of our  fathers; but those that keep the celestial law and   obey the principles of the gospel of Christ, you   never find them taking different roads. There is  but one right road, and it is a straight forward one,  and the principles and rules that govern you in  that path are simple and easy to be understood.—  This is the path for us to walk in and I consider   that we are greatly blessed in having learned the  true way and in being delivered from that yoke of  bondage that has chained us down with error,   false doctrine and false teachers.    This I count one of the greatest blessings that  God has given to the children of men, to have the   plain truth pointed out to them. You look at the   religions of the day, and see their confusion and   the mystery that hangs around them; you may  present the truth to them as plainly as you can,  and so simply that an intelligent child might un-  derstand and still they cannot comprehend it.—  You ask a man among them about the character   of God and about his attributes, and what can he  tell you? They will preach about God, about  the Son, and the Holy Ghost, long sermons, to  prove that those three personages are one, and  when they get thro' they know nothing about it  and conclude it is a great mystery.    Where is the man or woman that comprehend-  ed anything about God or about eternity until Jo-  seph Smith revealed the fulness of the gospel?  I could read of those things in the Bible which we  now believe in and receive, but I was surrounded  by the traditions of the world and could not com-  prehend them.    We are now taught, from time to time, the plain  principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the plan   of salvation—the way to live in order to have the  approbation of our Father in heaven. Is not this  a blessing above all blessings? If this people   could comprehend their blessings they never need  have an unhappy moment. If this people could   comprehend the position they stand in and their   true relationship to God they would feel perfectly  satisfied, and they would realize that our heaven-  ly Father is merciful unto us and that he has be-  stowed great and glorious blessings upon us.    When we consider that we can come into this   Tabernacle and sing, pray, preach, exhort and  bless, and that there is no sheriff standing at our   doors with writs to arrest us, we may consider these  things as blessings from the hands of the Almigh-  ty, for they are such.    As br. Brigham, br. Heber and many others  have said, there is not a man that is capable of  entering into the celestial kingdom of God who  is not willing to receive the instructions of his  brethren and abide the law of God. There is not  a man in this kingdom, who has got the right spir-  it within him, but who thanks God for the moun-  tains and for the five hundred miles of sage plains  that lie between us and the homes of our ene-  mies.    The hand of God has been visible in bringing   us here, and it has been visible with us all the   time, as far as we have taken the counsel that has  been given us. Thee are truths that cannot be  disputed.    I feel comfortable and truly thankful in my   mind for the blessings bestowed upon us, and I  feel to pray that we as a people may increase in   the knowledge of God and of the laws of his   kingdom, and in the knowledge of all those prin-  ciples that lead to glory, to exaltation and eternal  lives, and that will lead us back to our Father in   heaven. The troubles of the children of men are  very numerous, but a great many of them are   borrowed. I believe two-thirds of the troubles   of men are borrowed. It appears to be a natural   gift, or it seems natural to us to borrow trouble,  and it is a good deal so with our blessings, look   forward to some future time when we are going   to enjoy great and glorious blessings, but our  blessings are at the present time; this is the time  that we should enjoy the blessings that God has  given us. We should rejoice to-day and be happy   to-day and feel to thank the Lord for the bless-  ings that he has put into our hands, and as to   borrowing troubles, we should let them all pass,  for it is sufficient for us to pass through troubles   and trials when they are upon us, and if we pur-  sue this course, we may escape a great many   imaginary trying and perplexing scenes.    Many of us have expected trouble this winter   from enemies, and it did appear as if trouble was  inevitable, to look at things naturally. We may   look at things as they may approach us next sum-  mer, and we may expect that our enemies will   seek to destroy us; and in fact I do not doubt but   that it is now in the hearts of the children of   men to concoct schemes for our destruction, for  we know they desire to have this people blotted  out of existence. They have not the Spirit of   God, but they are in worse than midnight dark-  ness; and the consequence is they do not delight   or desire to see anybody live upon the earth who  will serve God and carry out his purposes. They   are afraid of the power of true religion, and of  the consequences that must necessarily arise, and  hence they feel to say in their hearts, there shall  not a kingdom be upon the earth that belongs to   God.    This is the feeling of our enemies, for they are   stirred up by satan to root out every principle of  righteousness and truth from the earth. Can  they do this? No, they never can. Why not?—  Because God reigns, governs and controls the ship   of Zion, and he has established the principles of  eternal truth upon the earth, and they do dwell in  the hearts of the children of men, and they will  bring forth fruit to the honor and glory of God.   We do know and understand that this kingdom  will not be given to another people ,for it is estab-  lished with a promise never to be given to another  people, but with the light of the Holy Spirit we  shall subdue our enemies and overcome every   obstacle. It is our duty to be continually increas-  ing in faith, that we may be enabled to call upon  the Lord with acceptance, and that we may stay   our enemies and hedge up their way, and let us pray   for them, and let us continue to believe that, if we  do as we are told we can accomplish whatever we  are united upon, and be assured that the Spirit of   God will not lead us to unite upon anything that   is evil.    We know it is right to establish a kingdom of   God upon the earth, and we know it is right to  establish in the hearts of men the principles of   life and salvation which God has revealed through  Joseph the Prophet.    If we will do our duty, and listen to those that are   set to lead us we shall find that the hand of God  will be over us for our good, and it will be against   those that are planning for our destruction, and  God will strengthen and uphold this people until  the day comes for the kingdom of God to spread   itself abroad, and until the law of God is issued  forth from Zion. We shall find that this will be the case,  and in as much as we have these privileges and  this faith, as Saints of the Most High we should   prize them and lay hold of them with one united  heart and not consider that the battle is to the  strong or the race to the swift, for the Lord holds  the destinies of all, and we are in his hands.    I do feel thankful to see the spirit of peace, and  the spirit of cleansing here at home; I am thank-  ful that I see the time when wicked men do not   delight to dwell here in Utah, and I do feel that  the righteousness, the conduct and the acts of  this people in general will be such that it will be  a hot place for wicked men.    It is our duty to live in this manner so that we   can ferret out iniquity wherever it exists. Men  that come here to seek for our gold and silver   find that it is now too hot for them. The day has  now come that they cannot bear the burning heat  of Zion, and I am glad of it, and I also hope that  we may still increase, for there is still room for   more improvement. We speak of improvement,  and truly there has been a great improvement in  the midst of this people, but there is still room   for great advancement to be made, for many of us  are still a long way short of being prepared for   the celestial kingdom, and of having the reward  promised to celestial and exalted beings.    There is great room for every man to labor and  to improve his life that he may be prepared to meet  our Father in heaven, and to enjoy the same glory  that those participate in who are heirs to the celes-  tial kingdom of God. Notwithstanding these  things are before us I fear that we do not suffi-  ciently appreciate them, but we must learn to so  order our lives that we shall be ready at any mo-  ment to respond to any and every call that may   be made upon us.    We feel at home here, and we feel that this is the  place for us, and my constant prayer to God is  that we may not only enjoy, but that we may  prize the privileges that are afforded us, prize the  day that we live in, and the City of Great Salt   Lake where we dwell.    Those who have been here for years past do   not realize the difference that there is between  this place and the world, but I can tell you that   with the wicked, it is one continual scene of blas-  phemy and of every species of wickedness that is  calculated to lead the mind down to death, and to   lead men and women from the way of life, and   from the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ, and from  every thing that is calculated to produce holiness  and purity in the human mind.    The power that predominates here has a ten-  dency to lead us in the path of virtue and rec-  titude and to unite us together; it will lead us to  obey the law of heaven and to carry out those   principles that we are taught day by day. In   this way we can do right and have the approbation  of our Heavenly Father, and then he will preserve  us from all our enemies, whether they be few or  many, and though the whole world be arrayed  against us the Lord will as sure preserve us and  make a little one a great nation, as he delivered   Israel out of Egyptian bondage, and this kingdom   will become as Daniel has seen it, a great moun-  tain and fill the whole earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]    These and all the blessings and promises which  he has given will be fulfilled in their time and in  their season, which may the Lord grant for Christ's   aske: Amen.

 October 6, 1890    THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President W. Woodruff    Stepped forward to the breastwork   of the stand and said: Before dis-  missing this Conference I want to   say a few words to the Latter-day   Saints. The Lord has said, by reve-  lation, to those who hold the   keys of the Kingdom of God:   "Whomsoever thou shalt bless   I will bless and whomsoever   thou shalt curse I will curse."    I have traveled something like a   hundred and seventy-five thousand   miles in my day and time, and I   have preached the Gospel to the   nations, to the islands of the sea and   to my own country. I have met,   in some instances, men who pro-  fessed to have faith in God and to   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,   who have stood up before me and   cursed the Prophet of God, Joseph   Smith, and blasphemed the name of  God. But in the midst of all these   things, I have never seen a moment   of my life when I felt to curse any-  body. I hope I never shall. But I   have told these men, under these   circumstances, that the curse of God   would overtake them; and in no   instance, when I have been moved   upon to say that, has it ever fallen   unfulfilled; for they have been   marked cases of the judgments   of God overtaking them. But   with regard to blessing, I will   say, if there was ever an   hour in my life that I felt to bless   the Latter-day Saints, it is at the   present time. My heart is drawn   out with love and gratitude towards   God and my brethren with whom I   am surrounded. I have been sus-  tained as a weak instrument in the   hands of God as the President of   this Church. Since I have been   called to this office I have been sus-  tained by the Latter-day Saints,   and for over fifty years of my life   as an Apostle. Why should not   my heart be drawn out in love to-  wards such a people? The world   know not the love of the Latter-day   Saints. They do not comprehend   it. It never entered into their   souls. I am surrounded here with   Prophets, Apostles, Elders and   Saints of the living God; and in the   morning of the resurrection, when   they come out of their graves, they   will pass by the Gods and the   angels who are set there to watch   the interests of the celestial world;   they will go to those thrones, king-  doms, principalities and powers   which have been ordained of God   for them to occupy—those who   dwell in this dispensation as well as   in other ages of the world. If I am   faithful, I shall meet you there; I   shall meet this people there; I shall  meet these Saints of the Living God   there. Therefore, I feel it is my   privilege to bless the Latter-day   Saints. I cannot go abroad, as a   man, and spread this Gospel to the   world and administer to them the   ordinances thereof, to have any   effect, without the Holy Priesthood;   and I, as a man, cannot bless the   inhabitants of the earth, so that the   Lord is bound to acknowledge it,   only by the power of the Holy   Priesthood; and that power I feel   to exercise at the present time in   blessing my brethren and sisters.    In the name of the Lord Jesus   Christ, I feel to bless my Counselors   —Presidents Geo. Q. Cannon and   Jos. F. Smith. They have stood by   me in all the labors of life, as far as   we have been associated, since we   have entered into the new and ever-  lasting covenant. On the same prin-  ciple, I feel to bless these Apostles   who surround me. We have been   united. We are united in the Gospel   of Jesus Christ, and they have the   gratitude of my heart for the labors   of love and life which they have   carried out in their day and time.   I feel to bless the Presidents of the   Seventies, with all their quorums in   this Church, with every blessing that   I have power to bestow upon them,   as a servant of the Living God.   I feel to bless the High   Priests, who bear the high and   Holy Priesthood after the order of   Melchisedec—their Presidents and all   who belong to the quorums. I also   feel to bless the thousands of the   Elders of Israel who have entered   into covenant with the Lord, who   have received a portion of the Mel-  chisedec Priesthood, and who have   gone forth and been faithful in the   ordinances of the House of God. I  feel to bless the Bishopric and the  Lesser Priesthood, which is after  the order of Aaron—the first Priest-  hood sealed upon the heads of Jo-  seph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by  John the Baptist, who held it, and  who laid down his own life for the  word of God and testimony of Jesus  Christ. I feel to bless these Latter-  day Saints, as fathers and mothers,   as brothers and sisters, in  all the ordinance of the House 
 Who was the Successor of  Joseph Smith?    Not long ago we saw an article in an Iowa paper, dated Utah [18]90, but  directed to an Iowa divine. The answer was given to the Utah man, but it  did not agree with what Joseph Smith taught his people concerning his suc-  cessor thirteen years before his death. The Utah man claimed to be an honest  seeker for truth, and wanted to learn who the successor of Joseph Smith was.    We made up our mind to point the Utah man, to what God and  Joseph Smith said on that question. Men have claimed they were the duly  Ordained, and all others were usurpers, when they were the greatest villains in  all the land, and led many to ruin. There was no need of this, as Joseph left  all doctrinal questions plainly written in the book of D. & C. Men have seced-  ed, and others have cried, Mormon delusion, when these very men were the most  deluded of all men. Mormonism, proper, is no delusion. It will bear as close  criticism as any other ism, and will stand clear as the sun and fair as the moon,  when all other isms will travel with that stone John told of in Rev. xviii, 21.    No man ever contended for good order and the true sciences, clearer than  did Mr. Smith. No man despised unsound doctrine in State or Church more  than Joseph. And the policy of government he handed down to us yet speaks,  though he sleeps with the worthy dead. This subject of Prophet Making is  just as clearly set forth in the church Book of Rules, as is any city or state law  on election of city or state officers. As early as 1831, he told the church how his  successor would be planted in his stead. At his death, all the people had to do  to learn the duly appointed man, was to heed the rules he gave them 13 years  before his death.    There was no excuse for divisions; the honest man who could read could  see when, and through whom he was to be appointed, and would identify the  man Angels ordained, to be the successor. But they set the law  aside, and set up their own ways. And men are doing the same this day, in  sending out Sermons and Tracts far away, deceiving the people by their opin-  ions, and the testimony of dead apostates, who preached lies when alive -- and  many are led this day by these false teachers. Much of the past work of these  villians has been laid to Joseph Smith, when he had no more to do with them   or their principles, than Abraham Lincoln had to do with Jefferson Davis.    Many have claimed that Mr. Smith was not parliamentary, and did not  claim nor contend for good order. No greater mistake could been made. He  claimed the government of God (the church) on earth, could only exist and  prosper as it heeded the Priest-hood of the Son of God. And then added: "As  no city or State can do legal business without duly authorized officers, no more  could the church." We give his views on Prophet Making, and on what terms  to accept their Revelations: "We do not consider ourselves bound to receive  any revelations from any man or woman without their being called or legally  constituted and ordained, and given sufficient proffs of it." -- Joseph Smith's  Letter of April, 1833.

Then, while these Twelve   Apostles preside over the Church, who is the  President of the Church? It is the President  of the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually as  much the President of the Church, while pre-  siding over Twelve men, as he is when or-  ganized as the Presidency of the Church, and  presiding over two men. And this principle   has been carried out, now for fifty seven years;  ever since the organization of the Church.    When Joseph Smith the Prophet was mar-  tyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forward as  the Presiding Authority of the Church, as  ordained of God, with Brigham Young at  their head, to preside over the Church and  direct its affairs. And when the Twelve Apos-  tles came to organize the First Presidency,  which of the Twelve Apostles stepped forth  to claim the right to preside over Brigham  Young? Not one.

 By this we see he put the people on their guard, that they be not deceived  by usurpers. Yet we know L. D. S. who have accepted and published to the  broad world, Revelations from men that had no more right to get or give reve-  lations than Ben Butler or Gen. Sheridan, yet these saints feast on the false  tales of usurpers, and call it good. As many as four times during his ministry,  he called the attention of his people to his death, and the appointing of another   in his stead. In 1830 he told the church how he was ordained by Peter, James  and John, (angels). [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] In 1831 he, in a definate and a plain way, told the plan that  would be adopted in setting a man in his place. This was done that the people  might not be deceived by by false brethren or usurpers. Yet with all of these  land marks, men have led their fellows from the Rook of Christ to fables and  lies. A Book of Rules was adopted by the church, which contained provisions   for filling up any vacancy that might occur by death or otherwise. By this  book I will show who the man was that was appointed and ordained to fill  Joseph's place. There is no great mystery in this matter, we only take the Book  of Rules, and by that, identify the man:    First, When was the Man to be Appointed? Book of Rules, Section 43,  Part 1st: "And this ye shall know assuredly, that there is none other appointed  unto you to receive Commandments, until he be taken."    There is nothing mysterious about this. All there is of it, there was no one  to be appointed until he was taken. This settles the question adversely, with  those usurpers and false teachers, who claim Joseph did ever ordain a man  (or boy) to stand as President of the church before he was taken. Comment is  not necessary. The next question is to let the Book tell us through whom was  the successor to be appointed. It reads: "But verily, verily, I say unto you,   that none else shall be appointed unto this gift, except it be through him," --  Book of Rules, Section 43, Part 2. We need nothing plainer on who was to ap-  point. We all know how President Harrison appoints officers in the Federal  Government, and the plan was carried out on the same principle by Mr. Smith  in appointing his successor. Further comment on this is not needed.    The next question we want to learn is the extent of Mr. Smith's power in   planting a man in his stead. We will let the Book settle this also: ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:4|Book of   Rules, Section 43, 2nd Part,## -- says, "If it (the gift) be taken from him, he shall   not have power except to appoint another in his stead. This limits Mr. Smith's   power to simply appoint another in his stead, etc. Then in addition to this the  Book reads, -- "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived -- that  you may know they are not of me. [##Doctrine and Covenants 43:6##] Will these Rules fail to detect all usurpers,  and help us to disern the duly appointed man? We say they will not, for God  said: "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived." Therefore by  these Rules we can criticise all that have put up claims, and directly identify  the man that was legally appointed, and by Angels ordained, as he told us  before, -- (1831).    We have learned when, and through whom, the successor was to be ap-  pointed; also the extent of Mr. Smith's power in planting the man to fill his  place. We now ask, Who was to ordain the successor? Let the Book answer  the question: "For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me, shall  come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before," -- ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:7|Book of D.  & C. Section 43, Part 2.##    This part of the planting the man into the Presidency, is like all the other  parts, plain and definite. He was to be ordained as he had told us before, this  date or time. In 1830 we are told, the Prophet Joseph, was ordained by Peter,    [sideways text] It make no odds, if you build your nests in   the clouds, [illegible] or tops of mountains he will  bring you down, as well as he did the Jews  for [executing] the Son of Man.

 of the Presidency? Because he was the  President of the Twelve Apostles, and he  was virtually as much the President of  the Church while Presiding over Twelve men,  as over two men. When President Young  died, who was the Presiding Authority  over the Church? The Twelve Apostles, and  none else. And who was the President of  the Church? John Taylor. Why? Because  he was the President of the Twelve Apostles.    And when the Twelve Apostles came to  organize a First Presidency again, which  of the Twelve Apostles was moved upon  to claim the right to preside over the  Church above John Taylor? Such  a thing did not enter into the heart of   one of the Twelve, nor any other man,   except Brother Daniel H. Wells, and   he said he had a Revelation that Joseph  F. Smith was the man to preside over the  Church. There was not one of the Twelve  Apostles believed one word of it.  And Brother George Q. Cannon was  the most opposed to it of any one of   the Quorum. ^And why did not any of the Twelve believe it?^ because, President John

 James and John, (Angels). By this we learn that the successor was to be or-  dained as the predecessor was ordained, no less no more. This compels us to hold that the successor was to be ordained by Angels. The Book (D. & C.)  brings us to these and no other conclusions. Thus we have fulfilled our prom-  ise, by simply telling the public what the Book says on the appointment and  ordination of the successor to Joseph Smith.    After setting forth the law on appointing and ordaining the successor, we  will add our own testimony: First, Joseph Smith was duly called and legally  ordained even by Angels, and stood to the nations of the earth as did Moses.  He filled his mission like a brave man. He translated from the records the  Book of Mormon, which contains the history of the Indians, and many other  important facts concerning the nations of this day. He need not suffered as he  did, yet he chose it rather than the honors of this short life. He was aware of  the fate that should befall him, but he stood up to do the work given him to do.  He died as a servant of God and the Christ Jesus Christ and has his reward.    At the death of Joseph, Mr. James J. Strang claimed he had been ordained  in the same way that Joseph was (by Angels) and had been legally constituted  the President of the Church. He published his claims, sent them abroad, and  published to the world he was ready and willing to meet, and discuss his claims  with any that were willing to compare their views with his. He clearly proved  his authority to all that took pains to criticise them. He was identified by the  public in and around the country where he lived and died, as the legal succes-  sor of Joseph Smith. He translated from the recoreds that was taken from  Laban the Book of the Law of the Lord, a work that Lehi had in view when he said  that Joseph should write. See 2nd Book of Nephi, 2nd Chapter. This Book of  the Law of the Lord, is often spoken of in the Bible, and has been called one  of the lost Books.    James, like Joseph, had bitter persecutions, yet he bravely stood for the  truth and right. He had presented views of his martyrdom, and called his  friends aside and gave them hints of coming trouble. He, like Joseph, might  of avoided it by leaving the church and seeking his own ease in the world.  But he chose to stand to his duty as the leader of God's people, and meet his  fate. We need not speak of his noble life, for it is read and known by the hon-  orable men that meet him in the legislative halls of his state.    It is true, many of the usurpers lied, and to cover their false claims they  misrepresented him and his teachings. But they stand on the page of history,  and will be read and known as long as sun and moon endure--while the usurp-  ers will fall with their lies. Men will yet rise up and honor the names of Joseph  and James as the chosen of God. ^Son^    We would like to end our testimony here and say, Peace to all Men; but we  want to warn all honest men, that they be not led by usurpers and false  teachers. It is a fact well known in all the factions of the Mormon schools, that  Gurley and Briggs reform that started in Wisconsin and terminated in the  Re-organization, have from the first, accused the others of holding bad faith.  And to this day have accused the Utah people of holding to lies, and teaching  false doctrine. By the land laws, they had a right to hold up to public gaze  what they held to, so long as their views were not opposed by the Government.    But let us take a look into the eyes of this re-organized child and see if we  don't find sand: This child of Gurley & Briggs has given the Martyr the lie,  and if Clark Braden knew how to handle the truth and lies, he would need no    [sideways text] I only teach the Revelations, of God, to his duly sent  prophets. You can get them & learn what I say  It makes odds, if you build your nests in [end of sideways text] 
 Taylor was the President of the Twelve Apostles,  and he had virtually been the President of the  Church since the death of Brigham Young.  (Now if Brother Cannon has become converted   from this theory, or any one of the Twelve, they  certainly must have some very strong reasons   for it.)    Now Brother Grant, I have given you one of  the reasons why I consider the President of   the Twelve should become the President of the  Church, in case of the death of the President.  If the President of the Twelve is not fit to  become the President of the Church, he is not  fit to be the President of the Twelve Apostles.    Again, there is another eternal truth stares   me in the face. In case of the death of the  President of the Church, Brother George Q. Cannon,   Wilford Woodruff, the President of the Twelve,  nor any six of the Twelve Apostles, combined,  have the power to appoint a President  for the Church. It takes Twelve men or   a majority of them, to appoint a President  for the Church. And so far as the appointment  of Brigham Young and John Taylor, as  the President of the Church: there has never

 been a dissenting voice with the Twelve A-  postles. And I certainly do not believe, should  President Taylor die to-day, that Brother  George Q Cannon, nor any other man, could  use argument enough, to convert a major-  ity of the Twelve Apostles to depart from the  beaten track laid out, and followed by  the inspiration of Almighty God, for the last  fifty seven years, by the Apostles, as re-  corded in the history of the Church.    As far as I am concerned, it would require  not only a much stronger argument than  I have ever heard, but a Revelation from the  same God who had organized the Church,  and guided it by inspiration in the chan-  nel in which it has travelled for fifty-  seven years, before I could give my vote, or  influence, to depart from the path followed  by the Apostles since the organization   of the Church.    Again, President John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff  are the only two men now living in the flesh, who  listened to the words and charge of Joseph Smith the Prophet  to the Twelve Apostles before his death. When  he said: "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart 
 better ropes (doctrine false) to hang the boys he has been playing with who claim  to defend Joseph as a Prophet. They tell us that Joseph Smith did in [18]43  anoint and ordain his son, and publicly on the stand in Nauvoo, said: "I  am no longer your Prophet, but this, my son, is your Prophet."    When this same Joseph had told the church years before, that all the part  he would be able to take in planting another man in his stead would be to ap-  point, and that he would not do until he was taken. Gentlemen of No.  17, will you tell us what to call you? Speak out, and tell us what to call you.  We want to call men and things by their right name. One thing is  sure, Joseph either lied or else you have in that No. 17. Them Books  and writings that Joseph left us, don't lie. Nor do we have to hunt from Bos-  ton to Oregon, to find witnesses to prove what they teach. The writings of  Moses, David, Jeremiah, Isaac, Malichi and the prophets, stood true and inde-  pendent of even the words of Christ and his Apostles.    So with the work of Joseph, what he told the world was true, independent  of the testimony of thousands. Yet false witnesses came against Moses, Christ,  and all the servants of God; we have page after page of their lies against the  truth. So with Joseph and James, we have their merit and on it we stand, and  the usurpers may compile and send out their tracts with the testimony of apos-  tates and dead Psuedoes who, when alive, told and published lies against Joseph  But the words of the Prophets Joseph and James, stand to us as the north star  to the Mariners on the ocean, at the midnight hour.    It looks bad to see a certain school of Saints throwing stones at Utah, when  they are telling lies daily. It reminds us of the old tricks of Ephraim, as found  in ##Hosea 12:1|Hosea, xii-1##; he lied daily in them days. Let the tales of modern Ephraim  speak for thsmelves. One thing is certain, if Clark-Braden knew how to  handle Joseph Smith and his works, he could find plenty of ropes (lies) in sight  of these men he has been debating with, to hang them, but not a string as large  as a fine thread to hurt Joseph or James. Joseph said in 1831 he would only  have power to appoint a successor; he also said the successor would not be ap-  pointed until Joseph was taken. This was all right, and came to pass just as  Joseph said thirteen years before--it was fulfilled in 1844. But here comes up a  school of fellows and tell us that Joseph did anoint and ordain his son in 1843,  and constituted him the President of the Church. Clark-Braden can't hurt  Joseph nor his successor on the policy of these wise Mormon Legislators, who  try to make Joseph a man-made and man-sent prophet. But if he can't take  Joseph's words and make them false teachers like himself, then he is small  potatoes and few in a hill, (to use a figure).    In conclusion, we say that we have proved that Mr. Smith pointed out the  policy that would be taken at his death, in planting a man in his stead. Mr.  Strang was the only man that ever presented legal claims to that office. We  might call up the names of scores that came out at that time and gave their  testimony to the world that James was the man. We might call over the names  of men and women, but we have our case without. If men will not accept of  what we have taken from the Books, they can go where all unbelievers go.  But there is one question that I am often asked: Who stands at the head of  the work of God, now? I answer, the man that holds the highest Priesthood!  It is the work of God, and He builds or pulls down when and whom he will.  Joseph Smith could not ordain a man to fill his place, but he could ordain a  man to fill any other office in the church. It took Angels to ordain him, and it    [sideways text] Yes as God cast out all the Hebrews, but Joshua & Calib  by then. So by  his Prophet he cast Brigham & those that  followed him.

 able from a financial  point of view. If I could  have sufficient time to  get out of debt I will be  willing & on hand to fill  the mission. I feel thank-  ful to the Lord that I have  been considered good enough  to fill such a responsible  position as I desire to fill  this mission. I hope therefore  that in the near future  I may get my affairs  so arranged that I can go.   I would have written before  but I thought perhaps  the way might be opened  so that I could get out of  debt and sufficient money  to go on a mission.

 for fear I might be taken away with the  Keys of the Kingdom of God upon me, before I  seal them upon the heads of other men; but   I thank God I have lived to see the day  when I have had power to give the Twelve  Apostles their Endowments. And I have now  sealed upon your heads all the Keys of the King-  dom of God, and the Powers of the Holy Priesthood  which God has sealed upon me. And now  I roll off the labor and work of the Church  and Kingdom of God, upon the shoulders of  the Twelve Apostles. And I now command  you in the name of Jesus Christ, to round up  your shoulders and bear off this Church and  Kingdom of God upon the earth, before  Heaven and Earth, and before God, Angels, and men.  And if you don't do it, you'll be damned."    Now Brother Grant, with this declaration and   charge ringing in my ears, should I outlive  President Taylor, (an event I never expect to   see,) I should strongly urge my brethren of the   Twelve Apostles to follow the beaten track,  marked out, and followed, by the Prophets and   Apostles for the last fifty seven years. And  I have full confidence to believe, that the Twelve

 took Angels to ordain a man like him. But we have no record that James  should appoint a man to fill his place. Yet we can tell our friends, who held the  highest Priesthood in the Church at the death of James.    Nov. 6, 1846, James J. Strang was commanded to go and anoint and ordain  Joseph Smith, the son of the martyr, to the same Priesthood his uncle Hiram  held. We have all the proof we want that James did obey God. And that left  the son of Joseph as one of the Presidents of the Church, and the Book of Rules  says in case of death of either of the 1st Presidents, the other shall preside until  the vacancy is filled. This was the situation of the church at the death of James.  So that by the virtue of the ordination Joseph obtain under the hands of James  and no other ordination. We hold him the legal President of the Church from  the death of James to this day.    Let those that want light on this last statement, get the Revelation of Nov.  6, 1846. That will tell on what young Joseph stands, and on what he don't  stand. Then I am questioned as to why I don't join the Gurley & Briggs Re-  form, handled now by young Joseph, my reply is: I was baptised in 1842, stood  by Joseph until death, then I accepted James, and stood by him until he was  shot; then when I learned that James did obey God and did anoint and ordain  the youth, I have identified him as the President and Patriarch as was Hyram  Smith, and I have nothing to join or disjoin. I stand in the same church that I  was baptised into in 1842. If [the] church will not save men and me, I fear that  one got up by men that accuse Joseph of lying and not doing as he promised,  will be no help to me.    I hold Mr. Smith as President of the Church, yet he don't hold the degrees  of Priesthood that Joseph did; he don't hold the keys of Mysteries; he don't  hold the Sceptre in his hand as did Strang, yet he will stand as President until  God removes him and sends another. But says one, "How can you hold him as  President, when he will not identify you in the Priesthood you obtained under  James?" What need I care how he holds me or don't hold me, when I know  what I have got and what he has. I am not a Republican, yet I will hold Har-  rison as President whether he pleases me or not, until his term is out. Yet I  will not endorse his veto or Bills he don't veto. I will stand back and say, Mr.  Harrison, go on, your time will run out! So I say of young Joseph, go ahead, I  will not adopt nor endorse your teachings. But I will say to all men, that he is  the President and only man in all the earth that holds Keys as did Hyram Smith.  I am just as well satisfied that young Joseph is doing the work, as that John the  Baptist, yet his people teach many things contrary to the order of God's  House.    I set my hand to this expecting to meet God and my fellows, wishing  all honest people well and no harm.    Truly and sincerely,    L. D. Hickey.  Coldwater, Mich., June 15, 1891.

 Apostles, have had experience and light enough  to shun any path pointed out to gratify the  private interest of any man, or set of men,  against the interest of the Church and Kingdom   of God on the earth. I once knew, not  only Twelve men, but twice Twelve leading   men, who undertook to appoint a Prophet and   President to lead the Church, before the death   of the Prophet Joseph Smith, but they aposta-  tized and went to perdition. And it would  be a very dangerous precedent for us to  set, to depart from the order which God has  pointed out; and it will be a precedent  which the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles will  never set from this time till the coming   of the Son of Man.    I was informed that President George Q. Cannon   used the argument, in the deeding of the Gardo House  to President Taylor, as the President of the Church,  that in the case of his death the Deed should  not go to the President of the Twelve Apostles  but to the President whom the Twelve should  appoint; (I certainly have no objections   to this,) saying that in the appointment of   Presidents Brigham Young, and John Taylor,

My partoner and I both want  to go on foreign missiions  as quick as the Lord will  open the way.

 it so happened, in those instances, that the  President of the Twelve Apostles was appointed,  but it did not follow that that principle  would be carried out hereafter. And the ar-  gument was used that Elder Woodruff pro-  phesied at a Conference at Ogden, that Joseph   F. Smith would become President of the Church,  and we would have to deviate from the usual  course, in order to have that fulfilled. And it  was said, that prophecy was recorded. Now  if Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy, and  that by inspiration of the Lord, which I verily be-  lieve he did, it will be fulfilled as sure as  fate; and that too, without deviating from  the path marked out by the Lord and followed  by the Presidency of the Church. I will also   here make a statement that I, Wilford Woodruff,   heard Heber C. Kimball and Prest Joseph Young  say that they heard Joseph Smith say in their   presence, and in the presence of others in 1832,   the first time that Joseph Smith, ever had   an interview with Brigham Young, he   said that Brigham Young would yet be the  President of the Church. And that was three years  before there was a Quorum of Twelve appointed.

 And no man knew that Brigham Young would  ever be an Apostle, unless God revealed it  to the Prophet. And still, after sixteen years  of revolution and change Brigham Young was  President of the Church, without turning to  the right or left, from the path marked out  by the Revelations of God. And that pro-  phecy is also recorded; and there was not  one chance in ten for that prophecy to  be fulfilled, that there is for Joseph F. Smith  to be president, in the regular channel of the   oOrder of God.    Now, Brother Grant, I have given you my reasons  for believing that, in case of the death of the President  of the Church, it is the right of the ^President of the^ Twelve Apostles  to become the President of the Church, and that the   majority of the Twelve Apostles will so decide, until  the coming of the Son of Man.    Now, Brother Grant, if you have any argument,  or light, outside of what I have presented, as  the path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in, dif-  derent from what we have followed as a Church,  and will forward it to me, I will carefully  give it investigation. But, I will confess,  I do not know the reason why Brother George Q.

Dear Brother:    In reply to your letter of the 17th. inst. calling  me as a missionary to the Southern States, will say that I fear it   will be impossible for me to leave by the time stated in your letter  as Brother Burgoyne is about to leave on a trip to Eurpope and will   probably be absent until the first of October. And as I am in his e  employ as manager of his business here, cannot arrange to leave  before his return.    If you can possibly arrange to change my mission to the British  Isles I would consider it a great favor, as I have a number of   relatives there whom I would like to see and to collect the gen-  eology of our family. If this change can be made I will be ready   to start as soon as Brother Burgoyne returns which will be some  time in October.

 Cannon has brought this subject up, and  made it a matter of conversation several   times since the appointment of President John  Taylor to the Presidency; or that he should  depart from the principle he so strongly ad-  vocated in the appointment of President Taylor.  I see no reason why we should be so anx-  ious to fix up bridges to cross over, that  we may never see in this life. It is a   bridge, I never expect to cross, for I never   expect to outlive the President of the Church.   And I think we all have sufficient business   on hand to attend to, without troubling our-  selves about affairs we may never see.   Of course President Taylor, like all other men,   will die some time—when that day comes,  it will be quite time enough for the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles to attend to the organiza-  tion of the Presidency of the Church.

 as a normal student, this being  my second year and, due to the vaery   straightened circumstances of our  family, I must stop before my   course is finished, which would  take one more year.

 CACHE VALLEY "the granary of Utah." In the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache.  No other valleys within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-  derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied  scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15  miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000  souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county  seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that be desired, short, mild  winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness,  and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and   for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the   northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such  as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories  in the west, the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a class  of yarns, blankets and linseys, etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy  this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-  joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of  this will receive a prompt reply.    The Oneida Mercantile Union,  DEALERS IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE.    Franklin, Idaho, Jan 15 1895  Pres Woodruff    Dear Brother, I recieved  a Letter yesterday from the president of the Southern  States mission giving lots of good counsel &c And among  other things says I should leave home with $75.00 or $100.  Now I find that $50.00 is about the limit of what I  can have to leave with. Now what I wish to Know is   whether I would be justified in leaving here with that  amount or not as I wish to follow counsel to the best of  my ability. Will you kindly advise me and as soon   as convenient. If I go I should like to leave here here  on the 21st so as to visit relatives in Salt Lake City  and vicinity    your Brother in the Gospel  Oliver H Shumway    I know of no laws forbidding an Elder  to go on a mission without purse or scrip, if  he has faith to do so, trusting in the Lord  for success, nor of any law compelling him  to have, 50$ 75$ or 100$, or any other sum  of money to start on a mission with.

 No 2    I learn that there is a monument  to be built in honor of Utahs pioneers,  this should be done, without stineh, let the  outsiders money not be spared in its  construction, as they have grown far, over the  way of toil and hardships, worked out  gratusley for them, setting them in unbound  luxury, There is different ideas in every  man, and mine, are these, around the   base of the monument, i would suggest  that the road we made and traveled,   and some of the most striking seens  be chiseled out, for the road to start  with the seen, where you, wer the center  figure, and the time i held my breath for  your safety, when the 2 buffales ^bulls^ wer  after you, this seen would want to be  made with the camps hands up, men on  horseback going to your rescue, and your  horse going off with the wild hurd, would  want your name to this, this mutch to finish  one side, The crossing of the Plat over
