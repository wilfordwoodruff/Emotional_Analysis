My health is about as usual, except a severe cold that for a day or two deprived me of speech. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have been attending conferences of late. We went through Sanpete, attended the conference, and held nine meetings, and one at Nephi. We had full houses, and much interest was manifested. The sectarians,  priest and people, attended some of our meetings. We attendod the Tabernacle in this City last Sunday. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon spoke and occupied the time, as I was too hoarse to speak at all. All our crops are quite forward. We have had some fine rains; but it is getting dry again. They are beginning to cut the first crop of lucern. Concerning the Government I can only say that Harrison is showing his hand by appointing such men as Zane for C Justice; and it seems as though he intended to make a clean sweep of all Democrats and put in Republicans in their place.

In regard to the water question for the St. George Temple I wish  to say, we have again consulted Brother Ottinger and laid before him the views of  Brother Thompson and yourself: and he says that he will warrant that inch and a  half pipe to deliver 435 gallons of water per minute, and that ought to satisfy us  all. It is as much water as we will need, and I trust to his judgement, he being so  well aquainted with hydraulics. I have written to Brother McAllister and Brother  Thompson upon this subject. I am glad you and your family are getting better. I  had a very severe attack two days ago which lasted several hours, but through ad- ministering, etc. I was delivered. I feel al^l^right to-day.

As Statehood seems to promise the readiest solution of  some of the prominent questions involved in the great problem of the hour, and no  other way  has as yet been manifested, it would seem proper for us to bend our  faith and energies in that direction, that, if it shoul prove to be the will of the Lord, we may be found striving for that object; and should it not prove to be the will of the Lord for us to get a State goverment, then would be justified  in that we acted according to the best light and wisdom we possessed. And in  conclusion upon this point, I may add that if it be the will of the Lord that Utah should become a State, "all hell will be powerless to hinder it," just as  you say, and certainy we should be found in accord with God's will. It is proper  that we should strive to accomplish His purposes, always acting upon the best light  we possess.
