 Joseph Smith was to appoint a man. God said he should not have power, except to appoint. And that was not to be done, until hewas taken. Joseph done all that God, & hesaid he should do. Again, Joseph didall his part in planting Another. Again,God & Joseph said, the Successor, shouldbe ordained, as was Joseph & Oliver.See 43rd S, D. &. C.This was all fulfilled to the letter. In the call of James J Strang.In all that have claimed to been, set up,there has not a man, that has givena shadow of Law, or logic, (but James)that they have any claim or ever had.God rejected Brigham & those thatfollowed him, & cast them out, & theybecame, as heathen men. And they holdthe same relation to God, this day.All the Temples, Tabernacles, & otherworks under Brigham, or those ass-ociated, Amounts to no more than thechurches or Temples of the Gentiles.They had no Prophet of God. And surelysurely, The Lord will only work by a Prophet. Such is my testimony to you.And better than all that, instead of ourgoing to Utah & joining that Body, theyall have got to come to God & be baptizedby us, or those who hold Priesthood orthey will go to prison.

Nel-son to our representative in Salt Lake City, Miss M. Glassford.Mr. Nelson was formerly in our employ, but left our services be-fore settling his debts, and went to Sweden to work as a missionaryHe wrote us from Sweden, an apology for so doing, but we think youwill agree with us, this is not the proper way for men to pay theirdebts, and could not be used in licquidating any claims which wemay have to pay. We believe Miss Glassford presented it to someof the officials who had charge of Mr. Nelson's work and they re-ferred her to you. Through a combination of circumstances ioverwhich she had no controll, she was unable to see you at the timeshe expected, and hence we have thought it wise to drop you a noteand present yout the bill. Miss Glassford has always spoken inhighest terms of her treatment in Salt Lake City and has assuredus many times that there would be no doubt of this obligation be-ing met as soon as it was placed before the proper authorities,and as we have exercised great patience in saying nothing of thismatter for so long a time, we trust you will show your appre-ciation of this fact by giving this matter your personal super-vision, so that it may be liquidated at once.Will you kindly let h us hear from you by return mail, andstate just what we may depend upon, for it seems to us that thetime has almost come when patience has ceased to be a virtue, andwe feel the matter should have prompt attention.This we feel sure you will give and hope to hear fromyou as requested.Yours truly,R.

 the truth, get what God said, of you before& after you left Nauvoo. That settles the ques-tion as what relation you hold to God &the church organized in A.D. 1830. Youhold no more priesthood from Brigham& those who usurped authority with him, ^then^did any man or set of that Joseph cut offunder God before his death. When you, (orthey) usurped & despised the Man God setup by Joseph. It was the same God & priest-hood that cast Brigham out, & offthat cast off Saul & all that followed him afterhe was rejected, & David, the Son of Jesse wasset up on the throne. Saul made a greatfuss, for a while & abused the man God set upin the stead of Joseph. [##1 Samuel 18:9-12##] So Brigham abused the man James, yet God was with James bothby signs, & wonders, & proved to the churchJames was the Successor of Joseph. The work he done proves it clearlyThe church is composed of a dulyordained prophet, & other inferiorQuorums, all subject to the Prophet.Hence you see clearly or may The church never went to Utah. But a [band pondues], set up, Brigham (notGod) & they called it the church when ithad no Head. But a man made hand.Yours truly & SincerlyL D Hickey

I have giventhe subject some thought and reflection, andI now feel prepared to answer the question, ac-cording to my views. You asked me if I knew any reason, in case of the death of thePresident of the Church, why the Twelve Apostles should not choose some other person to be the President of the Church, instead of the Presidentof the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know of several good sound reasons; which Iwill now give you. In the first place thereare two or three plain truths which are eter-nal, everlasting, unchangeable, and immovable,as the pillars of Heaven, as far as this Dis-pensation is concerned; which have beenestablished by the Revelations of God throughthe mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

 DISCOURSEBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Sundaymorning, Dec. 27, 1857-[REPORTED BY J. V. LONG ]-It seems to fall to my lot to occupy a few mo-ments this morning, and I feel to say that this is a blessed place, and that this is a blessed people,and that they are partaking of a great many bles-sed things.If the Latter Day Saints could prize and com-prehend the blessings that are given unto them,and if our minds were enlightened continually bythe Holy Spirit, we should feel ourselves blest, andcomprehend that we are made partakers of the greatest blessings which the Lord imparts unto the children of men, I may say far greater thanthe rest of our fellow creatures who now inhabitthis earth.The Lord says, whosoever are quickened by a portion of the celestial spirit and abide a celestial law they shall inherit a celestial glory; whosoever are quickened by a terrestrial spirit shall inherit aterrestrial glory. I realize this, and consider thatthe Lord has revealed unto us the celestial law,that is, he has given unto us the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and has given us a know-ledge of the principles of eternal life. The Lord reveals truth unto the children of men, by whichtruth we are to be qualified and prepared for ex-altation. Truth has been presented in its simpli-city so that it might be comprehended by the sonsof men.As I reflect this morning upon the condition of the human family, and consider how differently we are situated from the masses of mankind, I do feel that we ought to be grateful to our great Benefac-tor. There are millions of the human family who assemble in various houses, in cathedrals, churchesand chapels for the purpose of worshipping God,but is there one of those numerous congregations who come together with an understanding of thetruth, except there be some Latter Day Saint El-der who is called to preach to the inhabitants ofthe earth? Do they come together understanding the principles of the same gospel, the same plan ofsalvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ, in a way andmanner to make them one?Now, God could not make a people one with so many kinds of faith and such a multiplicity of doc-trines, diametrically opposed to each other, as ex-ist in the world, but we are a blessed people, we have the principles of union and oneness with us,and by carrying them out, they bind us together and make us one.It is upon this principle that the Latter DaySaints are blest, and made free. We are deliver-ed in a great measure from those troubles andperplexities, false doctrines, the darkness, the errorand superstition by which our minds have beenbeclouded until the light has made manifest untothe children of men that they were in darkness, forthis was the case with us all; until the light camewe were groveling in the dark, in a great measure. Though we might be honest, and we might be ac-tuated by the best and holiest feelings, yet, until the fulness of the Gospel was revealed, the worldwere like the blind groping for the wall. We had no Apostles, no Prophets, we had no inspired mento rise up and tell us what to do to be saved, andwe had to go through with all that trouble, miseryand darkness to which the children of men are sub-ject while living under false doctrines, false tra-ditions, and false teachers.I have frequently remarked in my life, and I was sincere in the sentiment in saying that Iwould rather take a six months' tour in the pen-itentiary than to go through with a six months'conviction and conversion in the sectarian world, according to their order of doing business. Letany man go through the ordeal of six months' con-viction and conversion in the Presbyterian churchand then be made acquainted with the true plan ofsalvation, and he will feel about as I do upon the subject.Read the history of any man, and read his ex-perience in the religious world and you will find that it is worse, as far as the affliction of the soul is concerned, than as long a time in the peniten-tiary. We will take a Presbyterian revival, a manis called by the sectarian excitement to get reli-gion; he goes to the clergy,I do not care whetherit is in a synod, or in any other place, but supposethat he has a great desire to seek after the planand principles of salvation, and he applies to theclergy, they will tell him like this: you must sur-render yourself to the Lord. He goes to work to pray and fast, and he is faithful and diligent intrying to give his heart to the Lord, but he is stillin trouble, and he goes to the priest and informshim of his situation, and the priest tells him all thetime, you must give your heart unto God, you must be willing to be damned and to suffer allthings for the sake of Christ. The minister stillpleads with him to submit himself to God, but hedoes not tell him the first step which he ought totake in order to have his sins forgiven and obtainsalvation, but tells him continually that he must do it, that he must give his heart to God. Theresult is that the man mourns and weeps, and byand bye he thinks that he has committed the un-pardonable sin, and he gets so that he thinks it is the worst sin that he can commit to pray when going through these feelings and this trial.I have read the history of many strong mindedmen, and besides this I know my own history andexperience, I know the way the children of mensuffer in attempting to give their hearts unto God,and as I have said, as far as the feelings of the children of men are concerned, it would not begrieving their feelings any more in bearing the re-proach of their neighbors to be sent to prison forcrime, than some men have endured in getting re-ligion.What is the reason of all this? It is becausethey have not the same law, because there is notany man inspired to rise up and teach them the way to be saved: no Apostle to teach the gospelof Jesus Christ.Now in the midst of these trials and tribulationsmany of you can remember how many nights anddays you have spent in suffering and distress, try-ing to give your hearts to God. And when you have been called into the circle of ministers havethey not called upon you again and again to cometo the anxious bench and get religion? I can well remember it, although I never joined any church at all until I joined the Latter Day Saints, but yetI attended meetings, and I have been called uponday after day and night after night to give myheart to God, so much so that I would get mad,to be told to do a thing so many times that I wasall the time trying to do, for I had a desire to do that which was right, but did not know how to take the first step, and those who taught couldnot tell me how.Now had there been an Apostle there to havesaid, 'go and repent, be baptized for the remissionof your sins, and then I will lay my hands upon you that you may receive the Holy Ghost, whichwill lead and guide you into all truth, it will en-lighten your mind in relation to the principles ofeternal life, and it will show you things past, pre-sent and to come;' how easy this would have beenproviding a man inspired of God had been there.In relation to these things this people are truly blest, but the world are in worse darkness than they were before Joseph Smith received revela-tion from heaven. They have gone into thickerdarkness, for the gospel has been offered to thechildren of men, to the most of the Christian na-tions during the last twenty-five years, and in a great measure they have rejected it, but before the light came to them they did not know what to do, for the world were bound up in ignorance, darkness, and by false traditions, false principlesand false teachers who gave unto the children ofmen their erroneous opinions for doctrines of sal-vation.We are liberated from these things, the cloud of darkness is taken from us, and the light of eter-nal truth has begun to shine upon our minds.Some of this assembly have embraced this gos-pel in foreign countries, and many of us in thisour native land, and now we have all come togeth-er to hear preaching, exhortation, and receive in-struction in the things of God, and we have comeexpecting to hear the truth and in this we have not been disappointed, for we do hear the truthfrom this stand; we have been taught the pure principles of virtue and righteousness by the serv-ants of God.The knowledge we have received has takenfrom us those troubles of mind and soul, and those distressing feelings which were occasioned by those false doctrines and traditions that were im-planted in our minds in early life, and that havecaused us so much suffering in days that are gone. Then I say it is a great blessing that God hasgiven unto us the celestial law, the principles ofthe Gospel that will lead to celestial glory and eter-nal lives.The Lord has for years past been continually revealing the simple principles that will bring us back into the presence of our Heavenly Father,and which will give unto us a place in his celestial kingdom, if we abide a celestial law.We can all see the effects of the establishment of the church and kingdom of God upon the earth,and we perceive that the effects of the gospel arevery different from false tradition, and from sec-tarian absurdities that deluge the world. The re-quirement is that men shall abide the celestial law of God, in order that they may be quickened bythat power and be united by those principles withthe Apostles and Prophets, and all those beings who have been quickened by it in ages that are gone, and dwell in the light and presence of God, and be forever in the society of the city of Enoch and our brethren who have gone before us, and who have been made perfect by the same gospel which we have received.If we were to go into the celestial world weshould then be actuated by the spirit that predom-inates there, and have continually with us those principles by which we should be governed. Wehave got to possess the same spirit and principlesin this world, and we have got to abide a celestial law here and be united upon the principle that un-ites the people of God who dwell in his presence,in order to get the same glory that they enjoy.These are the principles that are taught us fromday to day, and we must learn to carry them out,and we must lay aside our selfishness and all false principles that we have imbibed and that havebeen taught us from our infancy, in order that wemay obtain the blessings and power of God.It is different with us from what it is and will be with the children of this people. As one of theold Prophets said, speaking of the gathering in thelast days, when they would come together, wake up from their drowsiness, get to understand prin-ciple, and see their true position, they will say, 'Surely our fathers have inherited lies, and thingswherein there is no profit.' And it is truly so,for we can already say that our fathers have in-herited lies, and we have inherited many of their traditions.Until we heard the fulness of the gospel wewere filled with traditions and false doctrines and the teachers of the day did not instruct men towalk in the same path, but they were continuallyteaching something that would divide men in theirfeelings, and that would produce as many differ-ent creeds and schisms as there were sects in theworld, and hence we have all the evils attendant upon that course of life.This puts me in mind of a circumstance that happened when I was preaching in Kentucky. Ipreached upon the first principles of the gospel,and at the close of my discourse I gave the priv-ilege for any one to ask questions, or to make re-marks if they felt so disposed. A gentleman aroseand I noticed that a great many of the congrega-tion began to laugh, and I afterwards learned that the gentleman was an infidel, and hence the con-gregation were disposed to make fun of him. Hesaid, 'I will not detain you long, but I wish to state to this large congregation that Mr. Woodruff has taught me more this evening than I ever learnedin my whole life before. From my boyhood Ihave been searching into religion, and when Ihave asked a minister in relation to the way oflife, he would point me to the way he was walk-ing himself; then I would ask another, and he would point out a different way; and I might have asked a hundred, and they would all have pointed out a different road, and they would tell me that I must be born again. I observed men who weresaid to be born again, and one class of men whowere said to be born again would take one wayand another would take quite a different road, andI always marveled at this, for I did not see any sense in men taking different roads to lead to the kingdom of heaven, but now this man, Mr. Wood-ruff, has told me the truth, and shown me the reason they took so many different roads afterthey were born again, and the reason is becausethey were all born BLIND.'This in reality is the case, for many of us havebeen born again according to the traditions of ourfathers; but those that keep the celestial law and obey the principles of the gospel of Christ, you never find them taking different roads. There isbut one right road, and it is a straight forward one,and the principles and rules that govern you inthat path are simple and easy to be understood.—This is the path for us to walk in and I consider that we are greatly blessed in having learned thetrue way and in being delivered from that yoke ofbondage that has chained us down with error, false doctrine and false teachers.This I count one of the greatest blessings thatGod has given to the children of men, to have the plain truth pointed out to them. You look at the religions of the day, and see their confusion and the mystery that hangs around them; you maypresent the truth to them as plainly as you can,and so simply that an intelligent child might un-derstand and still they cannot comprehend it.—You ask a man among them about the character of God and about his attributes, and what can hetell you? They will preach about God, aboutthe Son, and the Holy Ghost, long sermons, toprove that those three personages are one, andwhen they get thro' they know nothing about itand conclude it is a great mystery.Where is the man or woman that comprehend-ed anything about God or about eternity until Jo-seph Smith revealed the fulness of the gospel?I could read of those things in the Bible which wenow believe in and receive, but I was surroundedby the traditions of the world and could not com-prehend them.We are now taught, from time to time, the plainprinciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the plan of salvation—the way to live in order to have theapprobation of our Father in heaven. Is not thisa blessing above all blessings? If this people could comprehend their blessings they never needhave an unhappy moment. If this people could comprehend the position they stand in and their true relationship to God they would feel perfectlysatisfied, and they would realize that our heaven-ly Father is merciful unto us and that he has be-stowed great and glorious blessings upon us.When we consider that we can come into this Tabernacle and sing, pray, preach, exhort andbless, and that there is no sheriff standing at our doors with writs to arrest us, we may consider thesethings as blessings from the hands of the Almigh-ty, for they are such.As br. Brigham, br. Heber and many othershave said, there is not a man that is capable ofentering into the celestial kingdom of God whois not willing to receive the instructions of hisbrethren and abide the law of God. There is nota man in this kingdom, who has got the right spir-it within him, but who thanks God for the moun-tains and for the five hundred miles of sage plainsthat lie between us and the homes of our ene-mies.The hand of God has been visible in bringing us here, and it has been visible with us all the time, as far as we have taken the counsel that hasbeen given us. Thee are truths that cannot bedisputed.I feel comfortable and truly thankful in my mind for the blessings bestowed upon us, and Ifeel to pray that we as a people may increase in the knowledge of God and of the laws of his kingdom, and in the knowledge of all those prin-ciples that lead to glory, to exaltation and eternallives, and that will lead us back to our Father in heaven. The troubles of the children of men arevery numerous, but a great many of them are borrowed. I believe two-thirds of the troubles of men are borrowed. It appears to be a natural gift, or it seems natural to us to borrow trouble,and it is a good deal so with our blessings, look forward to some future time when we are going to enjoy great and glorious blessings, but ourblessings are at the present time; this is the timethat we should enjoy the blessings that God hasgiven us. We should rejoice to-day and be happy to-day and feel to thank the Lord for the bless-ings that he has put into our hands, and as to borrowing troubles, we should let them all pass,for it is sufficient for us to pass through troubles and trials when they are upon us, and if we pur-sue this course, we may escape a great many imaginary trying and perplexing scenes.Many of us have expected trouble this winter from enemies, and it did appear as if trouble wasinevitable, to look at things naturally. We may look at things as they may approach us next sum-mer, and we may expect that our enemies will seek to destroy us; and in fact I do not doubt but that it is now in the hearts of the children of men to concoct schemes for our destruction, forwe know they desire to have this people blottedout of existence. They have not the Spirit of God, but they are in worse than midnight dark-ness; and the consequence is they do not delight or desire to see anybody live upon the earth whowill serve God and carry out his purposes. They are afraid of the power of true religion, and ofthe consequences that must necessarily arise, andhence they feel to say in their hearts, there shallnot a kingdom be upon the earth that belongs to God.This is the feeling of our enemies, for they are stirred up by satan to root out every principle ofrighteousness and truth from the earth. Canthey do this? No, they never can. Why not?—Because God reigns, governs and controls the ship of Zion, and he has established the principles ofeternal truth upon the earth, and they do dwell inthe hearts of the children of men, and they willbring forth fruit to the honor and glory of God. We do know and understand that this kingdomwill not be given to another people ,for it is estab-lished with a promise never to be given to anotherpeople, but with the light of the Holy Spirit weshall subdue our enemies and overcome every obstacle. It is our duty to be continually increas-ing in faith, that we may be enabled to call uponthe Lord with acceptance, and that we may stay our enemies and hedge up their way, and let us pray for them, and let us continue to believe that, if wedo as we are told we can accomplish whatever weare united upon, and be assured that the Spirit of God will not lead us to unite upon anything that is evil.We know it is right to establish a kingdom of God upon the earth, and we know it is right toestablish in the hearts of men the principles of life and salvation which God has revealed throughJoseph the Prophet.If we will do our duty, and listen to those that are set to lead us we shall find that the hand of Godwill be over us for our good, and it will be against those that are planning for our destruction, andGod will strengthen and uphold this people untilthe day comes for the kingdom of God to spread itself abroad, and until the law of God is issuedforth from Zion. We shall find that this will be the case,and in as much as we have these privileges andthis faith, as Saints of the Most High we should prize them and lay hold of them with one unitedheart and not consider that the battle is to thestrong or the race to the swift, for the Lord holdsthe destinies of all, and we are in his hands.I do feel thankful to see the spirit of peace, andthe spirit of cleansing here at home; I am thank-ful that I see the time when wicked men do not delight to dwell here in Utah, and I do feel thatthe righteousness, the conduct and the acts ofthis people in general will be such that it will bea hot place for wicked men.It is our duty to live in this manner so that we can ferret out iniquity wherever it exists. Menthat come here to seek for our gold and silver find that it is now too hot for them. The day hasnow come that they cannot bear the burning heatof Zion, and I am glad of it, and I also hope thatwe may still increase, for there is still room for more improvement. We speak of improvement,and truly there has been a great improvement inthe midst of this people, but there is still room for great advancement to be made, for many of usare still a long way short of being prepared for the celestial kingdom, and of having the rewardpromised to celestial and exalted beings.There is great room for every man to labor andto improve his life that he may be prepared to meetour Father in heaven, and to enjoy the same glorythat those participate in who are heirs to the celes-tial kingdom of God. Notwithstanding thesethings are before us I fear that we do not suffi-ciently appreciate them, but we must learn to soorder our lives that we shall be ready at any mo-ment to respond to any and every call that may be made upon us.We feel at home here, and we feel that this is theplace for us, and my constant prayer to God isthat we may not only enjoy, but that we mayprize the privileges that are afforded us, prize theday that we live in, and the City of Great Salt Lake where we dwell.Those who have been here for years past do not realize the difference that there is betweenthis place and the world, but I can tell you that with the wicked, it is one continual scene of blas-phemy and of every species of wickedness that iscalculated to lead the mind down to death, and to lead men and women from the way of life, and from the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ, and fromevery thing that is calculated to produce holinessand purity in the human mind.The power that predominates here has a ten-dency to lead us in the path of virtue and rec-titude and to unite us together; it will lead us toobey the law of heaven and to carry out those principles that we are taught day by day. In this way we can do right and have the approbationof our Heavenly Father, and then he will preserveus from all our enemies, whether they be few ormany, and though the whole world be arrayedagainst us the Lord will as sure preserve us andmake a little one a great nation, as he delivered Israel out of Egyptian bondage, and this kingdom will become as Daniel has seen it, a great moun-tain and fill the whole earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]These and all the blessings and promises whichhe has given will be fulfilled in their time and intheir season, which may the Lord grant for Christ's aske: Amen.

 October 6, 1890THE DESERET WEEKLY.President W. WoodruffStepped forward to the breastwork of the stand and said: Before dis-missing this Conference I want to say a few words to the Latter-day Saints. The Lord has said, by reve-lation, to those who hold the keys of the Kingdom of God: "Whomsoever thou shalt bless I will bless and whomsoever thou shalt curse I will curse."I have traveled something like a hundred and seventy-five thousand miles in my day and time, and I have preached the Gospel to the nations, to the islands of the sea and to my own country. I have met, in some instances, men who pro-fessed to have faith in God and to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who have stood up before me and cursed the Prophet of God, Joseph Smith, and blasphemed the name ofGod. But in the midst of all these things, I have never seen a moment of my life when I felt to curse any-body. I hope I never shall. But I have told these men, under these circumstances, that the curse of God would overtake them; and in no instance, when I have been moved upon to say that, has it ever fallen unfulfilled; for they have been marked cases of the judgments of God overtaking them. But with regard to blessing, I will say, if there was ever an hour in my life that I felt to bless the Latter-day Saints, it is at the present time. My heart is drawn out with love and gratitude towards God and my brethren with whom I am surrounded. I have been sus-tained as a weak instrument in the hands of God as the President of this Church. Since I have been called to this office I have been sus-tained by the Latter-day Saints, and for over fifty years of my life as an Apostle. Why should not my heart be drawn out in love to-wards such a people? The world know not the love of the Latter-day Saints. They do not comprehend it. It never entered into their souls. I am surrounded here with Prophets, Apostles, Elders and Saints of the living God; and in the morning of the resurrection, when they come out of their graves, they will pass by the Gods and the angels who are set there to watch the interests of the celestial world; they will go to those thrones, king-doms, principalities and powers which have been ordained of God for them to occupy—those who dwell in this dispensation as well as in other ages of the world. If I am faithful, I shall meet you there; I shall meet this people there; I shallmeet these Saints of the Living God there. Therefore, I feel it is my privilege to bless the Latter-day Saints. I cannot go abroad, as a man, and spread this Gospel to the world and administer to them the ordinances thereof, to have any effect, without the Holy Priesthood; and I, as a man, cannot bless the inhabitants of the earth, so that the Lord is bound to acknowledge it, only by the power of the Holy Priesthood; and that power I feel to exercise at the present time in blessing my brethren and sisters.In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I feel to bless my Counselors —Presidents Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith. They have stood by me in all the labors of life, as far as we have been associated, since we have entered into the new and ever-lasting covenant. On the same prin-ciple, I feel to bless these Apostles who surround me. We have been united. We are united in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and they have the gratitude of my heart for the labors of love and life which they have carried out in their day and time. I feel to bless the Presidents of the Seventies, with all their quorums in this Church, with every blessing that I have power to bestow upon them, as a servant of the Living God. I feel to bless the High Priests, who bear the high and Holy Priesthood after the order of Melchisedec—their Presidents and all who belong to the quorums. I also feel to bless the thousands of the Elders of Israel who have entered into covenant with the Lord, who have received a portion of the Mel-chisedec Priesthood, and who have gone forth and been faithful in the ordinances of the House of God. Ifeel to bless the Bishopric and theLesser Priesthood, which is afterthe order of Aaron—the first Priest-hood sealed upon the heads of Jo-seph Smith and Oliver Cowdery byJohn the Baptist, who held it, andwho laid down his own life for theword of God and testimony of JesusChrist. I feel to bless these Latter-day Saints, as fathers and mothers, as brothers and sisters, inall the ordinance of the House 
 Who was the Successor ofJoseph Smith?Not long ago we saw an article in an Iowa paper, dated Utah [18]90, butdirected to an Iowa divine. The answer was given to the Utah man, but itdid not agree with what Joseph Smith taught his people concerning his suc-cessor thirteen years before his death. The Utah man claimed to be an honestseeker for truth, and wanted to learn who the successor of Joseph Smith was.We made up our mind to point the Utah man, to what God andJoseph Smith said on that question. Men have claimed they were the dulyOrdained, and all others were usurpers, when they were the greatest villains inall the land, and led many to ruin. There was no need of this, as Joseph leftall doctrinal questions plainly written in the book of D. & C. Men have seced-ed, and others have cried, Mormon delusion, when these very men were the mostdeluded of all men. Mormonism, proper, is no delusion. It will bear as closecriticism as any other ism, and will stand clear as the sun and fair as the moon,when all other isms will travel with that stone John told of in Rev. xviii, 21.No man ever contended for good order and the true sciences, clearer thandid Mr. Smith. No man despised unsound doctrine in State or Church morethan Joseph. And the policy of government he handed down to us yet speaks,though he sleeps with the worthy dead. This subject of Prophet Making isjust as clearly set forth in the church Book of Rules, as is any city or state lawon election of city or state officers. As early as 1831, he told the church how hissuccessor would be planted in his stead. At his death, all the people had to doto learn the duly appointed man, was to heed the rules he gave them 13 yearsbefore his death.There was no excuse for divisions; the honest man who could read couldsee when, and through whom he was to be appointed, and would identify theman Angels ordained, to be the successor. But they set the lawaside, and set up their own ways. And men are doing the same this day, insending out Sermons and Tracts far away, deceiving the people by their opin-ions, and the testimony of dead apostates, who preached lies when alive -- andmany are led this day by these false teachers. Much of the past work of thesevillians has been laid to Joseph Smith, when he had no more to do with them or their principles, than Abraham Lincoln had to do with Jefferson Davis.Many have claimed that Mr. Smith was not parliamentary, and did notclaim nor contend for good order. No greater mistake could been made. Heclaimed the government of God (the church) on earth, could only exist andprosper as it heeded the Priest-hood of the Son of God. And then added: "Asno city or State can do legal business without duly authorized officers, no morecould the church." We give his views on Prophet Making, and on what termsto accept their Revelations: "We do not consider ourselves bound to receiveany revelations from any man or woman without their being called or legallyconstituted and ordained, and given sufficient proffs of it." -- Joseph Smith'sLetter of April, 1833.

 President of the Church dies, who then isthe Presiding Authority of the Church? It is the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, or-dained and organized by the Revelations of God. And none else. Then, while these Twelve Apostles preside over the Church, who is thePresident of the Church? It is the Presidentof the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually asmuch the President of the Church, while pre-siding over Twelve men, as he is when or-ganized as the Presidency of the Church, andpresiding over two men. And this principle has been carried out, now for fifty seven years;ever since the organization of the Church.When Joseph Smith the Prophet was mar-tyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forward asthe Presiding Authority of the Church, asordained of God, with Brigham Young attheir head, to preside over the Church anddirect its affairs.

 By this we see he put the people on their guard, that they be not deceivedby usurpers. Yet we know L. D. S. who have accepted and published to thebroad world, Revelations from men that had no more right to get or give reve-lations than Ben Butler or Gen. Sheridan, yet these saints feast on the falsetales of usurpers, and call it good. As many as four times during his ministry,he called the attention of his people to his death, and the appointing of another in his stead. In 1830 he told the church how he was ordained by Peter, Jamesand John, (angels). [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] In 1831 he, in a definate and a plain way, told the plan thatwould be adopted in setting a man in his place. This was done that the peoplemight not be deceived by by false brethren or usurpers. Yet with all of theseland marks, men have led their fellows from the Rook of Christ to fables andlies. A Book of Rules was adopted by the church, which contained provisions for filling up any vacancy that might occur by death or otherwise. By thisbook I will show who the man was that was appointed and ordained to fillJoseph's place. There is no great mystery in this matter, we only take the Bookof Rules, and by that, identify the man:First, When was the Man to be Appointed? Book of Rules, Section 43,Part 1st: "And this ye shall know assuredly, that there is none other appointedunto you to receive Commandments, until he be taken."There is nothing mysterious about this. All there is of it, there was no oneto be appointed until he was taken. This settles the question adversely, withthose usurpers and false teachers, who claim Joseph did ever ordain a man(or boy) to stand as President of the church before he was taken. Comment isnot necessary. The next question is to let the Book tell us through whom wasthe successor to be appointed. It reads: "But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift, except it be through him," --Book of Rules, Section 43, Part 2. We need nothing plainer on who was to ap-point. We all know how President Harrison appoints officers in the FederalGovernment, and the plan was carried out on the same principle by Mr. Smithin appointing his successor. Further comment on this is not needed.The next question we want to learn is the extent of Mr. Smith's power in planting a man in his stead. We will let the Book settle this also: ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:4|Book of Rules, Section 43, 2nd Part,## -- says, "If it (the gift) be taken from him, he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead. This limits Mr. Smith's power to simply appoint another in his stead, etc. Then in addition to this theBook reads, -- "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived -- thatyou may know they are not of me. [##Doctrine and Covenants 43:6##] Will these Rules fail to detect all usurpers,and help us to disern the duly appointed man? We say they will not, for Godsaid: "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived." Therefore bythese Rules we can criticise all that have put up claims, and directly identifythe man that was legally appointed, and by Angels ordained, as he told usbefore, -- (1831).We have learned when, and through whom, the successor was to be ap-pointed; also the extent of Mr. Smith's power in planting the man to fill hisplace. We now ask, Who was to ordain the successor? Let the Book answerthe question: "For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me, shallcome in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before," -- ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:7|Book of D.& C. Section 43, Part 2.##This part of the planting the man into the Presidency, is like all the otherparts, plain and definite. He was to be ordained as he had told us before, thisdate or time. In 1830 we are told, the Prophet Joseph, was ordained by Peter,[sideways text] It make no odds, if you build your nests in the clouds, [illegible] or tops of mountains he willbring you down, as well as he did the Jewsfor [executing] the Son of Man.You folks boust of being safe, because you arein the valley, but I see the catholic church & others aregathering.

 James and John, (Angels). By this we learn that the successor was to be or-dained as the predecessor was ordained, no less no more. This compels us to hold that the successor was to be ordained by Angels. The Book (D. & C.)brings us to these and no other conclusions. Thus we have fulfilled our prom-ise, by simply telling the public what the Book says on the appointment andordination of the successor to Joseph Smith.After setting forth the law on appointing and ordaining the successor, wewill add our own testimony: First, Joseph Smith was duly called and legallyordained even by Angels, and stood to the nations of the earth as did Moses.He filled his mission like a brave man. He translated from the records theBook of Mormon, which contains the history of the Indians, and many otherimportant facts concerning the nations of this day. He need not suffered as hedid, yet he chose it rather than the honors of this short life. He was aware ofthe fate that should befall him, but he stood up to do the work given him to do.He died as a servant of God and the Christ Jesus Christ and has his reward.At the death of Joseph, Mr. James J. Strang claimed he had been ordainedin the same way that Joseph was (by Angels) and had been legally constitutedthe President of the Church. He published his claims, sent them abroad, andpublished to the world he was ready and willing to meet, and discuss his claimswith any that were willing to compare their views with his. He clearly provedhis authority to all that took pains to criticise them. He was identified by thepublic in and around the country where he lived and died, as the legal succes-sor of Joseph Smith. He translated from the recoreds that was taken fromLaban the Book of the Law of the Lord, a work that Lehi had in view when he saidthat Joseph should write. See 2nd Book of Nephi, 2nd Chapter. This Book ofthe Law of the Lord, is often spoken of in the Bible, and has been called oneof the lost Books.James, like Joseph, had bitter persecutions, yet he bravely stood for thetruth and right. He had presented views of his martyrdom, and called hisfriends aside and gave them hints of coming trouble. He, like Joseph, mightof avoided it by leaving the church and seeking his own ease in the world.But he chose to stand to his duty as the leader of God's people, and meet hisfate. We need not speak of his noble life, for it is read and known by the hon-orable men that meet him in the legislative halls of his state.It is true, many of the usurpers lied, and to cover their false claims theymisrepresented him and his teachings. But they stand on the page of history,and will be read and known as long as sun and moon endure--while the usurp-ers will fall with their lies. Men will yet rise up and honor the names of Josephand James as the chosen of God. ^Son^We would like to end our testimony here and say, Peace to all Men; but wewant to warn all honest men, that they be not led by usurpers and falseteachers. It is a fact well known in all the factions of the Mormon schools, thatGurley and Briggs reform that started in Wisconsin and terminated in theRe-organization, have from the first, accused the others of holding bad faith.And to this day have accused the Utah people of holding to lies, and teachingfalse doctrine. By the land laws, they had a right to hold up to public gazewhat they held to, so long as their views were not opposed by the Government.But let us take a look into the eyes of this re-organized child and see if wedon't find sand: This child of Gurley & Briggs has given the Martyr the lie,and if Clark Braden knew how to handle the truth and lies, he would need no[sideways text] I only teach the Revelations, of God, to his duly sentprophets.

 Taylor was the President of the Twelve Apostles,and he had virtually been the President of theChurch since the death of Brigham Young.(Now if Brother Cannon has become converted from this theory, or any one of the Twelve, theycertainly must have some very strong reasons for it.)Now Brother Grant, I have given you one ofthe reasons why I consider the President of the Twelve should become the President of theChurch, in case of the death of the President.If the President of the Twelve is not fit tobecome the President of the Church, he is notfit to be the President of the Twelve Apostles.Again, there is another eternal truth stares me in the face. In case of the death of thePresident of the Church, Brother George Q. Cannon, Wilford Woodruff, the President of the Twelve,nor any six of the Twelve Apostles, combined,have the power to appoint a Presidentfor the Church. It takes Twelve men or a majority of them, to appoint a Presidentfor the Church. And so far as the appointmentof Brigham Young and John Taylor, asthe President of the Church: there has never

 been a dissenting voice with the Twelve A-postles. And I certainly do not believe, shouldPresident Taylor die to-day, that BrotherGeorge Q Cannon, nor any other man, coulduse argument enough, to convert a major-ity of the Twelve Apostles to depart from thebeaten track laid out, and followed bythe inspiration of Almighty God, for the lastfifty seven years, by the Apostles, as re-corded in the history of the Church.As far as I am concerned, it would requirenot only a much stronger argument thanI have ever heard, but a Revelation from thesame God who had organized the Church,and guided it by inspiration in the chan-nel in which it has travelled for fifty-seven years, before I could give my vote, orinfluence, to depart from the path followedby the Apostles since the organization of the Church.Again, President John Taylor and Wilford Woodruffare the only two men now living in the flesh, wholistened to the words and charge of Joseph Smith the Prophetto the Twelve Apostles before his death. Whenhe said: "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart 
 better ropes (doctrine false) to hang the boys he has been playing with who claimto defend Joseph as a Prophet. They tell us that Joseph Smith did in [18]43anoint and ordain his son, and publicly on the stand in Nauvoo, said: "Iam no longer your Prophet, but this, my son, is your Prophet."When this same Joseph had told the church years before, that all the parthe would be able to take in planting another man in his stead would be to ap-point, and that he would not do until he was taken. Gentlemen of No.17, will you tell us what to call you? Speak out, and tell us what to call you.We want to call men and things by their right name. One thing issure, Joseph either lied or else you have in that No. 17. Them Booksand writings that Joseph left us, don't lie. Nor do we have to hunt from Bos-ton to Oregon, to find witnesses to prove what they teach. The writings ofMoses, David, Jeremiah, Isaac, Malichi and the prophets, stood true and inde-pendent of even the words of Christ and his Apostles.So with the work of Joseph, what he told the world was true, independentof the testimony of thousands. Yet false witnesses came against Moses, Christ,and all the servants of God; we have page after page of their lies against thetruth. So with Joseph and James, we have their merit and on it we stand, andthe usurpers may compile and send out their tracts with the testimony of apos-tates and dead Psuedoes who, when alive, told and published lies against JosephBut the words of the Prophets Joseph and James, stand to us as the north starto the Mariners on the ocean, at the midnight hour.It looks bad to see a certain school of Saints throwing stones at Utah, whenthey are telling lies daily. It reminds us of the old tricks of Ephraim, as foundin ##Hosea 12:1|Hosea, xii-1##; he lied daily in them days. Let the tales of modern Ephraimspeak for thsmelves. One thing is certain, if Clark-Braden knew how tohandle Joseph Smith and his works, he could find plenty of ropes (lies) in sightof these men he has been debating with, to hang them, but not a string as largeas a fine thread to hurt Joseph or James. Joseph said in 1831 he would onlyhave power to appoint a successor; he also said the successor would not be ap-pointed until Joseph was taken. This was all right, and came to pass just asJoseph said thirteen years before--it was fulfilled in 1844. But here comes up aschool of fellows and tell us that Joseph did anoint and ordain his son in 1843,and constituted him the President of the Church. Clark-Braden can't hurtJoseph nor his successor on the policy of these wise Mormon Legislators, whotry to make Joseph a man-made and man-sent prophet. But if he can't takeJoseph's words and make them false teachers like himself, then he is smallpotatoes and few in a hill, (to use a figure).In conclusion, we say that we have proved that Mr. Smith pointed out thepolicy that would be taken at his death, in planting a man in his stead. Mr.Strang was the only man that ever presented legal claims to that office. Wemight call up the names of scores that came out at that time and gave theirtestimony to the world that James was the man. We might call over the namesof men and women, but we have our case without. If men will not accept ofwhat we have taken from the Books, they can go where all unbelievers go.But there is one question that I am often asked: Who stands at the head ofthe work of God, now? I answer, the man that holds the highest Priesthood!It is the work of God, and He builds or pulls down when and whom he will.Joseph Smith could not ordain a man to fill his place, but he could ordain aman to fill any other office in the church. It took Angels to ordain him, and it[sideways text] Yes as God cast out all the Hebrews, but Joshua & Calibby then. So by  his Prophet he cast Brigham & those thatfollowed him.

 for fear I might be taken away with theKeys of the Kingdom of God upon me, before Iseal them upon the heads of other men; but I thank God I have lived to see the daywhen I have had power to give the TwelveApostles their Endowments. And I have nowsealed upon your heads all the Keys of the King-dom of God, and the Powers of the Holy Priesthoodwhich God has sealed upon me. And nowI roll off the labor and work of the Churchand Kingdom of God, upon the shoulders ofthe Twelve Apostles. And I now commandyou in the name of Jesus Christ, to round upyour shoulders and bear off this Church andKingdom of God upon the earth, beforeHeaven and Earth, and before God, Angels, and men.And if you don't do it, you'll be damned."Now Brother Grant, with this declaration and charge ringing in my ears, should I outlivePresident Taylor, (an event I never expect to see,) I should strongly urge my brethren of the Twelve Apostles to follow the beaten track,marked out, and followed, by the Prophets and Apostles for the last fifty seven years. AndI have full confidence to believe, that the Twelve

 took Angels to ordain a man like him. But we have no record that Jamesshould appoint a man to fill his place. Yet we can tell our friends, who held thehighest Priesthood in the Church at the death of James.Nov. 6, 1846, James J. Strang was commanded to go and anoint and ordainJoseph Smith, the son of the martyr, to the same Priesthood his uncle Hiramheld. We have all the proof we want that James did obey God. And that leftthe son of Joseph as one of the Presidents of the Church, and the Book of Rulessays in case of death of either of the 1st Presidents, the other shall preside untilthe vacancy is filled. This was the situation of the church at the death of James.So that by the virtue of the ordination Joseph obtain under the hands of Jamesand no other ordination. We hold him the legal President of the Church fromthe death of James to this day.Let those that want light on this last statement, get the Revelation of Nov.6, 1846. That will tell on what young Joseph stands, and on what he don'tstand. Then I am questioned as to why I don't join the Gurley & Briggs Re-form, handled now by young Joseph, my reply is: I was baptised in 1842, stoodby Joseph until death, then I accepted James, and stood by him until he wasshot; then when I learned that James did obey God and did anoint and ordainthe youth, I have identified him as the President and Patriarch as was HyramSmith, and I have nothing to join or disjoin. I stand in the same church that Iwas baptised into in 1842. If [the] church will not save men and me, I fear thatone got up by men that accuse Joseph of lying and not doing as he promised,will be no help to me.I hold Mr. Smith as President of the Church, yet he don't hold the degreesof Priesthood that Joseph did; he don't hold the keys of Mysteries; he don'thold the Sceptre in his hand as did Strang, yet he will stand as President untilGod removes him and sends another. But says one, "How can you hold him asPresident, when he will not identify you in the Priesthood you obtained underJames?" What need I care how he holds me or don't hold me, when I knowwhat I have got and what he has. I am not a Republican, yet I will hold Har-rison as President whether he pleases me or not, until his term is out. Yet Iwill not endorse his veto or Bills he don't veto. I will stand back and say, Mr.Harrison, go on, your time will run out! So I say of young Joseph, go ahead, Iwill not adopt nor endorse your teachings. But I will say to all men, that he isthe President and only man in all the earth that holds Keys as did Hyram Smith.I am just as well satisfied that young Joseph is doing the work, as that John theBaptist, yet his people teach many things contrary to the order of God'sHouse.I set my hand to this expecting to meet God and my fellows, wishingall honest people well and no harm.Truly and sincerely,L.

 Apostles, have had experience and light enoughto shun any path pointed out to gratify theprivate interest of any man, or set of men,against the interest of the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth. I once knew, notonly Twelve men, but twice Twelve leading men, who undertook to appoint a Prophet and President to lead the Church, before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, but they aposta-tized and went to perdition. And it wouldbe a very dangerous precedent for us toset, to depart from the order which God haspointed out; and it will be a precedentwhich the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles willnever set from this time till the coming of the Son of Man.I was informed that President George Q. Cannon used the argument, in the deeding of the Gardo Houseto President Taylor, as the President of the Church,that in the case of his death the Deed shouldnot go to the President of the Twelve Apostlesbut to the President whom the Twelve shouldappoint; (I certainly have no objections to this,) saying that in the appointment of Presidents Brigham Young, and John Taylor,

 it so happened, in those instances, that thePresident of the Twelve Apostles was appointed,but it did not follow that that principlewould be carried out hereafter. And the ar-gument was used that Elder Woodruff pro-phesied at a Conference at Ogden, that Joseph F. Smith would become President of the Church,and we would have to deviate from the usualcourse, in order to have that fulfilled. And itwas said, that prophecy was recorded. Nowif Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy, andthat by inspiration of the Lord, which I verily be-lieve he did, it will be fulfilled as sure asfate; and that too, without deviating fromthe path marked out by the Lord and followedby the Presidency of the Church. I will also here make a statement that I, Wilford Woodruff, heard Heber C. Kimball and Prest Joseph Youngsay that they heard Joseph Smith say in their presence, and in the presence of others in 1832, the first time that Joseph Smith, ever had an interview with Brigham Young, he said that Brigham Young would yet be thePresident of the Church. And that was three yearsbefore there was a Quorum of Twelve appointed.

 And no man knew that Brigham Young wouldever be an Apostle, unless God revealed itto the Prophet. And still, after sixteen yearsof revolution and change Brigham Young wasPresident of the Church, without turning tothe right or left, from the path marked outby the Revelations of God. And that pro-phecy is also recorded; and there was notone chance in ten for that prophecy tobe fulfilled, that there is for Joseph F. Smithto be president, in the regular channel of the oOrder of God.Now, Brother Grant, I have given you my reasonsfor believing that, in case of the death of the Presidentof the Church, it is the right of the ^President of the^ Twelve Apostlesto become the President of the Church, and that the majority of the Twelve Apostles will so decide, untilthe coming of the Son of Man.Now, Brother Grant, if you have any argument,or light, outside of what I have presented, asthe path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in, dif-derent from what we have followed as a Church,and will forward it to me, I will carefullygive it investigation. But, I will confess,I do not know the reason why Brother George Q.

 Cannon has brought this subject up, andmade it a matter of conversation several times since the appointment of President JohnTaylor to the Presidency; or that he shoulddepart from the principle he so strongly ad-vocated in the appointment of President Taylor.I see no reason why we should be so anx-ious to fix up bridges to cross over, thatwe may never see in this life. It is a bridge, I never expect to cross, for I never expect to outlive the President of the Church. And I think we all have sufficient business on hand to attend to, without troubling our-selves about affairs we may never see. Of course President Taylor, like all other men, will die some time—when that day comes,it will be quite time enough for the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles to attend to the organiza-tion of the Presidency of the Church.I shall keep a copy of this communicationI remainYour Brother in the Gospel of ChristWilford Woodruff

 CACHE VALLEY "the granary of Utah." In the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache.No other valleys within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more variedscenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the countyseat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that be desired, short, mildwinters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness,and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, suchas lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factoriesin the west, the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a classof yarns, blankets and linseys, etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoythis wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back ofthis will receive a prompt reply.The Oneida Mercantile Union,DEALERS IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE.Franklin, Idaho, Jan 15 1895Pres WoodruffDear Brother, I recieveda Letter yesterday from the president of the SouthernStates mission giving lots of good counsel &c And amongother things says I should leave home with $75.00 or $100.Now I find that $50.00 is about the limit of what Ican have to leave with.
