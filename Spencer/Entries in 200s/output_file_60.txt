 Sandy. Mch. 12th 1894    Pres. Wilford Woodruf and Council  Dear Brotheren,    Being aware of your great desire of   developing the resources of the country and beleiving we can   afford the best facilities for the construction of a Sugar  factory, at Sandy, for the following reasons, is my excuse   for taking the liberty of addressing you. In the first place   it is about four miles from Sandy to a point on the little   Cottonwood stream, of water, where a succession of water   powers could be obtained sufficient to make an almost   unlimited amount of electricity, besides we have the purest  water for washing and making steam in the country. A.   suitable location could also be obtained, convenant to   receive freight for the accomodation of both the M. P. and   R. G. W. Rys. we are also centrally located to make it convenant  for the surrounding towns to deliver their beets, it has already   been established that our land is superior for the cultivation of  the beet, besides we have several thousand acres of vacant land  well adapted for beet, culture, that would furnish a great many   new employment who might desire to interest themselves in   the farming industry, I am also reliably informed that

 I did not have the means   to furnish my self, and   to pay my way to my field   of labor but that I was willing   to go if the means could be   raised.    I have not bin able to raise   the money up to this date   and I do not know that they   (the seventies) have endevered to   do so, but they thought they   could when they spoke to me   this spring.    these are my feelings and my   circumstances    now what shal I do under   these circumstances    I anxiously wait your   reply    your Brother in the Gospel   Erastus.

 there is now six ninths of the flow of the water of little   Cottonwood, owned by citizens who live below the east Jordon  Canal, who have ample water without being under the necessity  of useing the same on their land, and by getting the people   generally interested in an industry of that Kind I think   it would be easy to obtain that portion of the water of little   Cottonwood for the benifit of our undeveloped lands above the   east jordon Canal. There is another advantage to be   gained by useing an electrict power, for driving machinery  of this Kind. It would be so handy to switch of and apply to   any other industry, dureing, the remainder of the year it   would not be needed for making sugar. Trusting you these   few ideas may receive your favorable consideration  I remain your brother in the gospel.    Ezekial Holman  L.    [sideways text] Ezekial Holman  Mar 12 [18]94.

Please   advice me what to do in this matter as  our Bishop is not aware of my Condition  I will refere you to Dr O. H. Dogge, M.D.  of Salt Lake City, 202 W. 3rd  South.    Hopeing to hear from you soon and to recive  your counsel in this matter I remain  your Brother    Eugene Kimball.    Unless he is physically able, and has suffici-  ent faith to go on a mission, he should   be excused. I would say to him, we did   not want him to go unless he was in every   way prepared and could cheerfully accept   the call, and would therefore excuse him,   but if he recovered his health, and desired   then to fill a mission he could so inform  us. J. F. S. 
 In view of the facts stated   and in view of the further   fact, that the church is   not in a position to pay   Elders travelling expenses   more than one way, I   would suggest that his   time be extended until   he could raise the means   by his own efforts or otherwise   Jos.

My principal reason for asking more time  is that I have made arrangements to be  married next month. I have already asked

 Thomas Fork Idaho October 4th 1894    President Wilford Woodruff and Missionary  Comitty of the Apostles Box B. Salt Lake City Utah.    Deir Brethern:    Nearly fife years ago I was called to go on a  Mission to Swztzerland and Germany, but after explaining  my circumstances I was honerable released.    Two years ago I was again called, this time to the Northern  States Mission and after explaining again my circumstanses  I was again honerable released for the time being, but was  advised by you to prepare and report myself as soon as I  was ready to go.    I have worked hard in that direction and with the Blessings  of the Lord I am now able to say that my debts will be paid  shortly and my Familie left so they can make a Living without  a great eal of Help from the Bishop or Ward in which I live.    I started a small Dairy (Cheesedairy) last Spring and ifthe Bishop  says, he will assist them in getting some share Cens to milk  during the Summerseason and with that and a One half Income  of from about 15 head of Stock of my own I think they can  economicaly pull through.    My biggest drawbacks are: No money to go with and  pay my way espeshially if you should now again send me to Europe  (I have no Choise) To the Northern States it would not cost as  much and could raise money to go there in less time, but to  raise Money to go to Europe I dont see how I could raise it  in much less than a year, and if I stay another year at home  I will be able to prepare still better for  my Familie.    But my desires have been lately to go if possible  still it looks at times to me as allmost impossible.

Dear Brother:  Your esteemed favor of 19th inst. received.  In reply I am sorry to report, that it will be wholly  impossible for me to arrange my affairs so as  to start upon a misision to Scandinavia, March 3, next.    I have recently started in sheep-raising and  behsides investing my property, I have involved my-  self heavily, insomuch that to leave now would  mean my certain financial ruin.    If you, therefore, will kindly excuse me from  taking a mission at present, until my affairs  can be satisfactorily arranged, it will be  greatly appreciated.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  James Monsen    Peter Matson  Bishops Counselor    Give him the time  he needs. And  let him report    J. F. S.

Can the brethren of the Seventy satisfy him  as to whether his call came about   in the proper   way or not? I think it might be well   to give him a rest for a while. J. F. S.
