Have the kindness to read the matter over carefully and note any corrections or changes which you think should be made. If the sketch as it stands meets with your approval, mark it O K. In any event please re- turn it to us as soon as possible.  As we intend to print only so many copies of the book as we can be sure of selling, you are particularly requested to indicate whether you will want more than one copy ofor yourself and one for the bank.

The artistic merit, and actu al usefulness of the work for purposes of reference, identification, etc.,  will far exceed in value the amount we ask which, in fact, is just about  what the books will cost us.

This call has been made without any knowledge of the presidency of this Stake or of the bishop of this ward. We had been called upon to furnish a certain number of missionaries whiceh we have done and have a list of others to chose from as they shall be wanted. The parents of Riley G.  Clark Jr. some months ago were approached in relation to their son being called on a mission and they expressed a desire that he be given a chance to finish his education and then they would be more than willing that he should be called to perform a miss- ion as he would then be better prepared and their request awas considered by the local authorities here and garanted.
