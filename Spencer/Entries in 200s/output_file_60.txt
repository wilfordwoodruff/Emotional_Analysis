In the first place it is about four miles from Sandy to a point on the little Cottonwood stream, of water, where a succession of water powers could be obtained sufficient to make an almost unlimited amount of electricity, besides we have the purestwater for washing and making steam in the country. A. suitable location could also be obtained, convenant to receive freight for the accomodation of both the M. P. and R. G. W. Rys. we are also centrally located to make it convenantfor the surrounding towns to deliver their beets, it has already been established that our land is superior for the cultivation ofthe beet, besides we have several thousand acres of vacant landwell adapted for beet, culture, that would furnish a great many new employment who might desire to interest themselves in the farming industry, I am also reliably informed that

 there is now six ninths of the flow of the water of little Cottonwood, owned by citizens who live below the east JordonCanal, who have ample water without being under the necessityof useing the same on their land, and by getting the people generally interested in an industry of that Kind I think it would be easy to obtain that portion of the water of little Cottonwood for the benifit of our undeveloped lands above the east jordon Canal. There is another advantage to be gained by useing an electrict power, for driving machineryof this Kind. It would be so handy to switch of and apply to any other industry, dureing, the remainder of the year it would not be needed for making sugar.

Salt Lake City Utah.Deir Brethern:Nearly fife years ago I was called to go on aMission to Swztzerland and Germany, but after explainingmy circumstances I was honerable released.Two years ago I was again called, this time to the NorthernStates Mission and after explaining again my circumstansesI was again honerable released for the time being, but wasadvised by you to prepare and report myself as soon as Iwas ready to go.I have worked hard in that direction and with the Blessingsof the Lord I am now able to say that my debts will be paidshortly and my Familie left so they can make a Living withouta great eal of Help from the Bishop or Ward in which I live.I started a small Dairy (Cheesedairy) last Spring and ifthe Bishopsays, he will assist them in getting some share Cens to milkduring the Summerseason and with that and a One half Incomeof from about 15 head of Stock of my own I think they caneconomicaly pull through.My biggest drawbacks are: No money to go with andpay my way espeshially if you should now again send me to Europe(I have no Choise) To the Northern States it would not cost asmuch and could raise money to go there in less time, but toraise Money to go to Europe I dont see how I could raise itin much less than a year, and if I stay another year at homeI will be able to prepare still better for  my Familie.But my desires have been lately to go if possiblestill it looks at times to me as allmost impossible.
