Keep yourselves from evil  to take ^not^ the name of thy God in vane; for I am the Lord your  God, even the God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham  and of Isaac and of Jacob. I am he who led the children  of Israel out of the Land of Egypt and my arm is streched  out in the last days to save my people Israel cease to contend  one with another. Cease to speak evil one of another.  Cease drunkenness, and let your words tend to edeyfing one  another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt  restore that which thou hast borrowed, and if thou canst  not repay, then go straitway, and tell thy neighbor lest he  condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor  has lost, thou shalt make diligent search, till thou shalt  deliver it to him again. Thou shall be diligent in preserving  what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for  it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward If thou art merry, praise the Lord, with singing,  with music, with dancing and with a prayer of  praise and thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on  the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may  be joyful. Fear not thine enemies for they are in mine  hands and I will do my pleasure with them. My people  must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to  recieve the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion. And he that will not bear chastizment, is not worthy of  my Kingdom; Let him that is ignorant, learn wisdom  by humbling himself, and calling upon the Lord his God, that  his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened  that he may hear, for my spirit is sent forth into the world  to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnation of the ungodly.    your testimony, even the Nation that has driven you out; and  now cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of  sorrow like a woman that is taken in travel; and their  sorrow shall be great, unless they spedily repent! ^yea vary spedily^ for they  killed the prophets, and they that were sent unto them,  and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from   ENDENTRY  things, for ye are not yet pure: thou canst not yet bear  my glory, But thou shalt behold it, if ye are faithful  in keeping all my words that I have given you from the  days of  to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and the Apostles and  from Jesus and his Apostles to Joseph Smith, whom  I did call upon by mine Angels, my ministering servants  and by mine own voice out of the Heavens, to bring forth my work; which foundation he did lay, and was faithful  and I took him to myself. Many have marvelled becaus  of his death, but it was needful that He should seal his tes- timony with his blood, that he might be honored and  the wicked might be condemned.    I have left a witness of my name? Now, therefore, harken,  O ye people of my church; and ye Elders, listen together you have received my kingdom, be diligent in keeping  all my commandments, lest judgment come upon you,  and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over  you.

For the want of understanding many have suffered jealeousies to arise which afflicted theire minds with  troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some others  more than themselves, this I have s ever since its rise. it was manifest in Kirtland when the  first Bishop was ordained this jealeous feeling was manifest some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them  to ordain them a Bishop Father Morley and others that were present can bare record of this fact. And when the Twelve were chosen the same feelings exhisted &amp; in fact I will not  except all of them for some of them manifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. this spirit has been  the overthrow of many in this church and in fact upon  this principle thousands have fallen in all ages. The Lord  gives to everry man all the power influence and authority  that he can wield in righteousness and all that his goodness &amp; faithfulness merits then why should jealousies arise or what benefit can arise by suffering such feelings to exhist none at all, but those that cherish such feelings commence trying to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining  influence as Cain did instead of building up &amp; nourishing  every promising tree &amp; thereby prove himself worthy &amp; show  to his brethren &amp; to God that he loves the cause &amp; by his passive spirit that he is not ownly willing that others should  should prosper &amp; gain influence &amp; that he actually loves to  see them prosper for then he does all that he can through himse- lf, he helps advance it through others although they recieve the honor of it and he still be aware of it such a man will never be forgotten and to his honor glory and exhaltation there  shall be no end.    considerable uneasiness and trouble.  more wives than one, such tremendious fears take hold of some  that they hardly know how to live still they cant die, begin to   ENDENTRY  fear some man will be sealed to my wife, &amp; when they return  home some will be babbing about, you dont know but what you  have got another mans wife, are afraid to speak to a young  woman for fear that she belongs to somebody els or for fear some body els wants her.

I have raised some sixty bushels of good wheat without  Irrigations A few bushels of rye &amp; oats, And my corn in the field looks as well as any corn I ever saw in the states, the wheat crop exceeds all expectation. Oats do better than in the States, say 60 bushels to one of sowing on sod ground every kind of vegetable suited to the northern latitudes does well. Levi Hancock sowed Eleven pounds wait of calafornia wheat on the 14 the latter part of July. He sowed half a bushel of common English wheat on An Acre And A half And reaped upwards of twenty bush- els's one grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two ears. Barley that was sown ripened And was reaped And carried off, the land then was irrigated And produced from the roots A fresh crop four times the quantity of the first crop. Oats that were sown produced a   ENDENTRY  Another beautiful crop. three crops of Peas ripened on the same  spot of ground And the peas of the crop raised used for seed.
