Let each company provide themselves with all the Teams, waggons  provisions, clothing, and other necessaries for the journey that they  can. When the companies are organized let them go to with their might to prepare for those who are to tarry.   Let each company with their Captains, and Presidents, decide  how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient  number of able bodied and expert men, to take teams, seeds,  and Farming utensils, to go as Pioneers, to prepare for puting  in spring crops.   Let each company bear an equal  proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking  the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those  who have gone into the armey, that the cries of the widow  and the Fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord against  this people.   Let each company prepare houses, and fields  for raising grain, for those who are to remain behind this season, and this is the will of the Lord concerning his people; Let every  man use all his influence and property, to remove this people to the place whare the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion;   ENDENTRY And if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness, ye shall  be blessed, you shall be blessed in your flocks, and in your  herds, and in your fields, and in your houses, and in your families Let my servants Erastus Snow organize a  company, and let my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford Woodruff  organize a company: Also let my servants Amasa Lyman and  George A Smith organize a company and appoint Presidents  and Captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens:  And let my servants that have been appointed go and teach  this my will to the Saints that they may be ready to go to  a land of peace.   Go thy way and do as I have told you; and fear not thine  enemies; for they shall not have power to stop my work.  Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time time, and if any  man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my council  he shall have no power, and his folley shall be made manifest seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covet  not that which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evil  to take ^not^ the name of thy God in vane; for I am the Lord your  God, even the God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham  and of Isaac and of Jacob. I am he who led the children  of Israel out of the Land of Egypt and my arm is streched  out in the last days to save my people Israel cease to contend  one with another. Cease to speak evil one of another.  Cease drunkenness, and let your words tend to edeyfing one  another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt  restore that which thou hast borrowed, and if thou canst  not repay, then go straitway, and tell thy neighbor lest he  condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor  has lost, thou shalt make diligent search, till thou shalt  deliver it to him again. Thou shall be diligent in preserving  what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for  it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward If thou art merry, praise the Lord, with singing,  with music, with dancing and with a prayer of  praise and thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on  the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may  be joyful. Fear not thine enemies for they are in mine  hands and I will do my pleasure with them. My people  must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to  recieve the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion. And he that will not bear chastizment, is not worthy of  my Kingdom; Let him that is ignorant, learn wisdom  by humbling himself, and calling upon the Lord his God, that  his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened  that he may hear, for my spirit is sent forth into the world  to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnation of the ungodly.   Thy brethren have rejected you and your testimony, even the Nation that has driven you out; and  now cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of  sorrow like a woman that is taken in travel; and their  sorrow shall be great, unless they spedily repent! ^yea vary spedily^ for they  killed the prophets, and they that were sent unto them,  and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from   ENDENTRY the ground against them; Therefore marvel not at these  things, for ye are not yet pure: thou canst not yet bear  my glory, But thou shalt behold it, if ye are faithful  in keeping all my words that I have given you from the  days of Abraham Abraham; from Abraham  to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and the Apostles and  from Jesus and his Apostles to Joseph Smith, whom  I did call upon by mine Angels, my ministering servants  and by mine own voice out of the Heavens, to bring forth my work; which foundation he did lay, and was faithful  and I took him to myself. Many have marvelled becaus  of his death, but it was needful that He should seal his tes- timony with his blood, that he might be honored and  the wicked might be condemned.   Have I not deliverd you from your enemies, ownly in that  I have left a witness of my name? Now, therefore, harken,  O ye people of my church; and ye Elders, listen together you have received my kingdom, be diligent in keeping  all my commandments, lest judgment come upon you,  and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over  you.   So no more at present Amen and Amen.

There were present of  the quorum of the Twelve B Young H. C. Kimball  A Lyman and  E. T. Benson. After singing and prayer by President Young  he arose to address the meeting and remarked that he  had invited the Twelve to be present though they  were not of his family. yet I wish them to act free and  speak such things as the Lord shall give them.   Let me state a principle by which you may contemplate much. For the want of understanding many have suffered jealeousies to arise which afflicted theire minds with borrowed  troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some others  more than themselves, this I have sinceeen in the church ever since its rise. it was manifest in Kirtland when the  first Bishop was ordained this jealeous feeling was manifest some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them  to ordain them a Bishop Father Morley and others that were present can bare record of this fact. And when the Twelve were chosen the same feelings exhisted and in fact I will not  except all of them for some of them manifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. this spirit has been  the overthrow of many in this church and in fact upon  this principle thousands have fallen in all ages. The Lord  gives to everry man all the power influence and authority  that he can wield in righteousness and all that his goodness and faithfulness merits then why should jealousies arise or what benefit can arise by suffering such feelings to exhist none at all, but those that cherish such feelings commence trying to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining  influence as Cain did instead of building up and nourishing  every promising tree and thereby prove himself worthy and show  to his brethren and to God that he loves the cause and by his passive spirit that he is not ownly willing that others should  should prosper and gain influence and that he actually loves to  see them prosper for then he does all that he can through himse- lf, he helps advance it through others although they recieve the honor of it and he still be aware of it such a man will never be forgotten and to his honor glory and exhaltation there  shall be no end.   There is another principle that has caused  considerable uneasiness and trouble. ie the Idea of some mens having  more wives than one, such tremendious fears take hold of some  that they hardly know how to live still they cant die, begin to   ENDENTRY whisper and talk around am actually afraid to go on a mission for  fear some man will be sealed to my wife, and when they return  home some will be babbing about, you dont know but what you  have got another mans wife, are afraid to speak to a young  woman for fear that she belongs to somebody els or for fear some body els wants her. (others deny the faith as they think but they never had much) and say that it is all of the devil andc such foolish- nish ought not to be cherished among a wise and prudent people. Admitting  the Lord created the same number of women as men at the begining and were commanded to multiply and replenish the earth and to fill  up the measure of there creation in righteousness; the question is did they do it answer No, they soon disobeyed every commandme- nt and plunged themselves into wickedness and rendered themselves unworthy to raise up seed unto the Lord and in fact used every means in there power to cut off life and hinder woman answering the end for which they were created; nine tenth of them would rebel against the  vary thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the Lord's calling upon men who bears the priesthood to take to themselves  wives from among the daughters of men and raise up a righteous seed unto him that he might fill up the measure of there creation and hasten  the consumation of his purposes in righteousness in this dispensation according to his words previously spoken through his servents the  prophets. But those who suffer fears and jealouses to aris in there bosoms  either back right out or get to be mighty righteous and for fear that  they are sleeping with other mens wife—they kick up a dust or broil at home and perhaps abuse there own companion through jealousy  then go off to some woman that does not understand what is right or wrong and tell her that he has she cannot be saved without a man  and he has almighty power and can exhalt and save her and likely tell that  there is no harm for them to sleep together before they are sealed then  go to some doe head of an Elder and get him to say the ceremony, all done without the knowledge of the authority of this Church.  this is not right, and will not be suffered. The God I serve will reward  every ^man^ openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly and privately palming himself on the credulity of innocent ignorant  females. Such jealeousies do exhist and were I to say to the Elders  you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one half of  them would lie, swear, steal, and fight like the vary devil, to get men  and women sealed to them they would even try to pass right  by me and go to Joseph thinking to get between him and the Twelve some have already tryed to used an influence against me. but such jealeousies and selfishness shall be stoped and if the brethren do not  stop it I will blow it to the four winds by making them all come  and be sealed to me and I to my Father and he and all this church to  Joseph. when I go asstray and give wrong council and lead this people astray, then is time enough to pull me down and then God will  remove me as he has done all others who has turned from the faith. But to return, I have gatherd a number of families  around me by the law of adoption and seal of the covenant  according to the order of adoption the priesthood and others  have done likewise it being the means of salvation left to bring  us back to God. but had the keys of the priesthood been retained  and handed down from father to son throughout all generations up to the present time then there would have been no necessity  of the law of adoption for we would have all been included in the covenant without it and would have been legal heirs   ENDENTRY I Travelled 4850 Miles I Attended with the Twelve 12 concils I Held public meetings 44 Meetings I Baptized 14 persons I Confirmed 14 Persons I Ordained Jarias Sandford 85 1 Patriarch President of the seventies 1 seventy Administered to sick persons 20 sick persons I Blessed 10 children I wrote 60 Letters I Recieved 39 Letters   ENDENTRY FIGURE WILFORD WOODRUFFS JOURNAL FOR 1849   ENDENTRY January 1, 1849 ~ Monday   JAN 1st 1849 Monday this is the first day of 1849 we have  traversed in our minds and recorded some things which has transpired during the past year what the present year will bring to pass time must determin.
