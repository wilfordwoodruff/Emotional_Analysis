 hour and heard them relate the State of affairs in that city. The mob ofHancock County and the State of Illinois had swelled to over one thousandmen and had come upon Nauvoo and one hundred of the brethrenhad kep[t] them off three days then had a pitched battle of one hourand twenty minutes and drove the mob off the ground. The lossof the brethren was 3 killed but that of the mob was not knownThe morning of Sunday the 27 we spent hearingread a Missourian paper giving an account of the battle betweenthe mob and the Mormons of Nauvoo; also of General Karney'sarmy of the West among whom was the Mormon Battalion. Therewas a prospect of the whole army suffering for want of food.We appointed a meeting to be held at 2 o'clockin our new city to hear a statement from Squire Wells of theaffairs in Nauvoo. Before the meeting there was heard thecry of fire on the prairie grass of the encampment. All ranto put it out and it was soon extinguishedMeeting opened at 2 o'clock at the Council Blockby prayer from Orson Pratt who also made some remarks uponthe subject of the time and he was then followed by Squire Wells whogave to the assemblyA Narrative of the Battle Between the Mormons ofNauvoo and the MobHe said: "I will by request give a short account ofaffairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard that men were lynched there. We took 15 of the offenders who were sentto Quincy for a trial and they were let out on bail. The mob thenissued writs against Picb^k^et^t^ Clifford and Furnice. The two latterwent; Picb^k^et^t^ would not. A mob was then raised as a posseeto execute the writs they said. They stayed several weeks toincrease their numbers. They had at first about 300 and increasedto a thousand. The hundred men we had laid in ambush 
 for the mob. ^who^ They cannonaded through the day but did no harm. Next daythey tried the same thing again. We repelled themOn Saturday at 1 o'clock they advanced upon the citywith from a thousand to twelve hundred men. We met them in the nameof God and gained the victory. The action lasted one hour and twenty minutesThey fired 42 cannon balls and we 32 balls. Although the mob wereten to our one they were defeated and retreated from the battlefield. Wehad three killed and none ^2^ wounded. The mob would not acknowledge anykilled but we walked over the battlefield and found a plenty of mob bloodOne man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies inone waggon and they were handled like dead ^hogs^ and other waggons wereloaded in the same way. One of the Saints lying in a cellar saw8 wounded brought to the building each one telling where he was shotThey dug at their entrenchment after the battle. It was supposedthey buried their dead there.The next day was Sunday. They didnot fire any but we threw some ball and burst one cannonOn Monday the mob sent us a cannonball to let us know they had some left and we sent it back againDuring the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike andrun and get it and bring it to us and we would send it backagain.On Tuesday a committee was sent tous to make a treaty but it was rejected by both parties. A Brigadewas then called for but afterwards a treaty was made. We agreedto surrender the city and leave in five daysOn Wednesday evening the treaty was madeand the Saints and the Saints began to pack up their goods and the next dayall goods was removed. As the mob came in we left two blocksin advanceWe met many of the Saints on this side of theriver in distress and it drew tears ^even^ from the eyes of some of the mobWe saw campfires of the mob the same night we left on both 
 sides of the river.There were scenes transpired in the seige enough to meltthe heart of a stone. The lynching of men when they are labouring fora living and whipping them until they cannot stand alone as the mobdid was a damnable thing. They made them kneel on a spot wherethey said some one was buried and placed them in a position so theycould be whipped easy. An old Revolutioneer was one of themand he was so beaten by the mob that he has not been able to getabout all summer. I have an old grandfatherâ€”a RevolutioneerI have thought I would not let him know anything about it butkeep it from him that his feelings might not be harrowed up ashe is about ready to sleep in his grave. But I will say nomore but give way for brother CutlerBrother Cutler said:I can bear my testimony thatwhat brother Wells has said is strictly true. If I were to talktill sundown the whole could not be told. I have been keptin Nauvoo by the hand of God. Others wanted to have beenhere and would have been had it not been necessary to stop tosave our brethren there who could not get away. I know the handof God has been manifest in the salvation of the people in NauvooI thank God I had a hand in the battle. And the hand of God wasso visible in that battle that many who were weak and faltering have beenmuch strengthened by it and will gather with the Saints. I did not expectthat God would deliver their enemyies into their hands but expected thatHe would save them out of the hands of their enemies and this he haddone.I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo. The timehad come for us to depart. God has called upon us to go and if wewill not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out but theywill not get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongsto the Saints.I hope the day will come when we shall not 
 have to suffer from mobs but if we had sought to save our lives in this caseby fleeing many would have lost them for but few could have fled; but wewent out in the name of God and conquered. Through the blessing of God we havedone well. One brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp tospy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a sheep. The mob do notacknowledge having any killed but they had a good deal of blood spilled therethey could not cover up which I saw. Captain Smith who was captainof the guard at the time of the death of Joseph was shot in the neck butnot killed. Another commander of the mob was also shot. Bro Wellshas done well in all places where he has been put in the midst of dangeras well as in safety. With regard to the citizens of Nauvoo therewere but few who stood by us in time of trouble. There are manyspirits in Nauvoo who are like bats ready to join any party thatconquer. If the beast conquer they will show their legs, if the feathered tribe their wings.President Young arose and saidI wish to make a few remarksattached to those which have been made. I will inform the brethrenwho have come up that we are that we are glad to see them. BrotherCutler has been with us before. Brother Wells has been in our societyfor several years and I have had considerable acquaintance withhim and I am more than ever satisfied with his course. We haveprayed for our brethren continually. I am sensible that there isa good deal of suffering there and here but let me say that the Lord Godwho has fed us all the day long has His care still over us. When theSaints are chastized enough it will cease. At least the hand of Godwill be visible in their salvation. Some individuals may fall butthe body will be sustained. I have never believed the Lord wouldsuffer a general massacre of this people by a mob. If tenthousand men were to come against us if no other way was open theearth would open and swallow them up. Some say they can stayin Nauvoo and can live there in perfect peace they ar so righteous 
 There are some who have no better eyes than to say let me live with thewicked in peace, but thereir blessings will be scarce with the mob andif they do not leave I fear they will prove a source ^scourge^ in the hands ofGod. He works with the wicked by law and when they trespassupon his rights God is there to maintain themMany other remarks were made byPresident Young.On the Sunday following during theintermission of meeting Orson Pratt Amasa Lyman and myselflaid out the city of the camp of Israel named Winter Quartersinto thirteen Wards and appointed a Bishop over each Ward. Weordained six BishopsOn the Monday we stated on a grapeingexpedition. I took five women in my carriage to pick grapesOn our way we shot three prairie chicken got refreshments at BrJ. Alred cut a road half a mile for my carriage and got on tothe grape ground at dark a distance of 20 milesAt daylight we arose breakfast onPrairie chicken stew went on to the grape ground and found the grapeson cottonwoods and willows. I cut down several hundred of themabout the size of my arm and some larger and at sundown wehad picked three barrels of bunch grapes and started home by moon-light arrived at the camp of Israel quite weary next day and pressedout about 20 gallons of juice for wineAnother Of My Serious AccidentsNearly two weeks later October the 15th I took myaxe and went into the wood to cut some board-timber with twoof the brethren. While falling the third tree I steped backfrom it several feet but when it fell it shot back of thestump and bounded and struck me in the breast and knocked^me^ several feet into the air against a standing oak and the falling 
 tree caught me against it and I came down crushed between the two trees.My left thigh and hip were badly brused & my left arm; my breast bone brokeninto about 6 inches and three of my ribs of my left side broken and my lungsand vitals bruisedAfter the accident I sat down upon a log andwaited until Brother John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horseNotwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ridetwo and half miles over a rough road and my bones being so much brokenevery step went through me like an arrow. I rode to Turkey Creek and wasexhausted and was there taken off and carried in a chair home. EldersYoung Kimball Richards and others met me in the street and assistedme home where I was laid upon my bed exhausted. Here I laid without being able to move much until my bones knit togetherand they began to knit on the 9th day but I was not able tosit up in my bed until the 1st of November.On the 4th I was helped out of my waggon andwith the assistance of two persons I was enabled to walk to my tentand to Sister Benbows waggon where she laid very sick. On this dayour little son Joseph was taken sick ^and^On the 12th of NovemberMy Son Joseph Died.As I grew convalescent bour little son declined. Hesuffered much from convulsions during his sickness and breathedhis last 15 minutes before six o'clock in the morning and we tookhis remains to the grave at 4 in the afternoon. His loss wasa great sacrifice to usI began to labour once more on the 17thand during the next two weeks was overwhelmed in business whichwas the case with the whole Camp of IsraelI had never seen the Latter-day Saints inany situation where they seemed to be passing through greater tribulations 
 or wearing out faster than at the present time. After being exposedto the sufferings of a tedious journey of 10 months in tents and waggonswithout houses we were now oblige to build a city of log housesnumbering more than one thousand for the purpose of stoppingin for about three months. We also had to go a great distancefor wood and timber and get it out of deep ravines andhollows which made it very hard to endure. I wastrying to build a log house for myself and one for my fatherand this on the first days of my labour after my seriousaccident and broken bones.Death of Sister BenbowIt will be remembered that brother Benbow who wasa respectable farmer was the first fruits of my extraordinarymission in Herefordshire and one of my chief helpers. SisterBenbow had also ministered to my wants and the wants ofmy brethren the Twelve in a foreign land and haddone much good. Her husband and her had helpedthe Saints to gather ahad gathered with them and had sharedour privations and hardships in the wilderness whichwere ended to her by death on the 27th of NovemberShe rested from her labours and her works will followOn the 3rd of December I assistedDr Richards to finish his house eight square framed coveredwith puncheon upon which we put fifty loads of dirtI drew the first load and superintended the buildingduring the dayDecember the 8th Mrs Woodruff gaveBirth to A Son whom we called Ezra and heDied two days afterwardsat half past nine oclock in the evening. We buried 
 him the next day making two sons whom we had laid in thegrave within so short a time.On this day the main body of the warriorsbelonging to the Omaha nation were out on a hunting party andwere surrounded by a party of the Sioux and sixty of theOmahas were killed. This was a great loss to the Omahanation among whom in consequence there was great mourningand wailingThe Camp of Israel was now devided into streetsblocks and Wards and a Bishop over each to see to the poor and the widowsand to keep an account of what each man was doing. The Twelve HighCouncil and Bishops met each week to do business and to manage the affairsof the Church and instruct the Saints in each WardThere was begining to be murmurings throughoutthe Camp of Israel at this time and much wickedness that the Lord wasnot pleased with. The Saints appeared like the children of Israel in theWilderness and the Nephites on this continent who at times would forget ^their^ Godand turn to wickedness. And while in council on the evening of the 15thof December the High Council asked President Young for some teaching andhe arose and said that he had no teaching to give at present but to cryrepentance to the people and he would begin with the High CouncilThey must repent he said and the Camp of Israel must repent or theTwelve would have to flee out of their midst and go to the MountainsOn the following Sunday I met with myWard the 14th for an organization according to the arrangement appointedand I warned the people to repent before the Lord lest a scourge comeupon them. I was followed by Elders George A Smith and OrsonPratt and brother Smith reproached the people for their treatment towardsme in not building me an habitation for the Winter as I had beensick.We were informed that there was to be a meeting atthe Stand so we dismissed ours and repared to the meeting place wherewe found a large congregation assembled and President Young addressing 
 [START HERE] them. The following are some of the words which fell from his lips whichI noted while presentPresident Young Crying Repentance to the Camp of IsraelHe loudly called upon the Camp of Israel to repent and said:"You must stop your swearing; you must stop your cheating; you must stop your lying; you must stop your stealing; you must stopyour whoredoms; you must stop your backbitingsâ€”speaking evil of the Twelve speaking evil of meâ€”you must stop these things and put awayyour wickedness or you will be damned; you will be destroyed; you will be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword and you will fall to the ground and I warn you and foreworn you of these things if you do not repent. Yes councillors High Priests and Elders here in the camp of Israel will say I will be damned if I pay my tithing orif i will do this or that.If God was like man he would hurl you down to hell and let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercyonly keeps you outThere are many here who are corrupt androtten at the core and I have no more fellowship for them than I havefor John C. Bennett. If I fellowship these things it will drag me down to hell with you and I will not do it. Brother Joseph being a very merciful man bore with these things until it took his life but I will not do it. Men get led away by degrees until the devilgets possession of their tabernacles and they are led captive at the will of thedevilAnd now I say that these who are calculatingto continue in wickedness and serve the devil had better go no further with this camp. They had better go to Missouri and spend the rest of the time with the gentiles; for I can swear to them if theygo with us and continue their wickedness their heads shall be 
 severed from their tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall have no tabernaclesto dwell inThe truth of the matter is there are many places whichwe pass through that have been the slaughterin ground of the ancient Nephitesand Lamanites and the spirits of devils are hovering around it and ifyou are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at theirwill; for if you are not governed by the Spirit of God you will be by thespirit of the devil. If you are governed by the Spirit of God while insuch places and they cannot enter you ^any of you^ they will try to enter your cattleyour beast for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine inancient daysI had rather go to the Mountains with theTwelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those whowill not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness andserve the devil for if we continue with this company and they do notrepent the righteous will fall with the wickedThere are people in this camp who are stealinghay and wood and I know who they are. Will I fellowship them?No I will not; and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they thinkwe are fellowshiping them and doing the same ourselves but it is notso. Joseph suffered much from the same cause. Because heknew of the rascality and wickedness his enemies and many of theSaints thought he was guilty of it himself. The truth of the matteris those who are leading the house of Israel while in the path of theirduty know the wickedness that is among the people. It cannotbe hid from them for they are in vision all the timeI will now look a little upon the otherside of the question. I will say however that if we have amind to be subject to the will of the Devil Death Hell and thegraveâ€”we may be and bow down to it all the day long orwe may have perfect power and triumph over itWho am I surrounded by? By menwho have entered into covenant with God who have received endowments in 
 the temple and are called to be saviours upon Mount Zion. To save whatOur Fathers and Israel clear back to Fallen Adam who are still lying intheir graves and waiting for the redemption of their bodies through yourinstrumentality. Then will you curse sware lie steal commitadultery and take the name of God in vain? Pretty saviours youwould be. O shame! God and angels would blush at suchconduct. Then repent and do the work appointed you. Manyare overtaken in fault who desire to repent and turn to God. Shallwe cast such away. Nay; but bear with them as God bears withus. We cannot be sanctified all at once but have tobe tried and placed in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmostto see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we maybe safe when we come into the Kingdom of God and not do asLucifer did the first time an opportunity is offeredâ€”rebel againstGod and the Council of Heaven and be hurled down to hell in amanner that you could not be redeemed at allYou must not sin murmur and complainwhile in the midst of your trials because you have been mobbedand tried even to the utmost. It is no excuse for you to commita wicked deed, take the name of God in vain or do any evil.Now all of you forsake it. Repent and turn to God and youshall be blessed.Notwithstanding I have thus reprovedyou I consider you the best people as a body on the earth andif there were any better I would go to them and take you withthem who desired to goIn speaking of the redemption of our deadI would say that there are millions who have died from the daysof Adam to Christ who weare waiting for their bodies to be raisedIn comparason to the number but few arose at the resurrectionof Christ and they were some who had the Priesthood or fulnessof it sealed upon them."President Young made many other 
 useful remarks band closed by blessing the people believing they would repentand what was said made a deep impression upon the congregation.Statisticsof the Number of the  Camp of Israel in Winter Quarters.on the 20th if Dec. 1846.The following is a true report:Total number of souls...... 3483Sick persons ...... 334Well men ...... 502Sick men ......117Absent men ......138Policemen ...... 19Women whose husbands were in the Mormon Batallion of the United States Army ...... 53Widows ...... 75Waggons in Camp 814; Horses 145; Mules 29; Yokesof oxen 388 1/2; Cows 463; cords of wood drawn 83 3/4Number of days spent by the camp in building a Mill Race 561 1/4I spent the 21st in drawing logs for a Council Houseand the next day in assisting the twelve in laying its foundationIt was to be built of large logs 32 by 22I was quite unwell the following day yet I went into the woods with Father and chopped 3 loads ofwood and brought home two loads of itChristmas DayThe dawn was saluted in the camp of Israel by the firing of

The forepart of the evening was occupied inconversing upon a variety of matters. There was an intermission duringwhich time a little recreation was taken. Prayers were afterwardshad and President Young and Kimball spoke in tongues awhile. Wethen went into council and our final dicission was that we fit outa pioneer company and follow them as soon as grass growsthe pioneer company to go this Winter as far as they could goon rushes and brows[e] then as far as they could on grass until itwas time to put in their corn crop.

On my arrival in the city of theSaints where I joined my wife and children who had only reached homea few days before me I found that President Young and the Twelvehad led out the camp of Israel into the wilderness and without amoments rest after my return I gathered up my friends and a companyof Saints from the Gentiles and joined the camp of Israel intheir journeyings to the wilderness and passed through all the trialsprivations labours and sufferings attendent on such a journey; andin spite of my severe accident and broken bones late in the year I builtmy own house helped the building of others cut down and drew my woodand hay and generally assisted with the Twelve in establishingWinter Quarters.

He was the Recorder and Historian of the Churchand wrote of these councils which will be found in the GeneralChurch HistoryOn the 14th of January in a council of theTwelve at which I was present at Elder Heber C. Kimball's a revelationwas given concerning the organization of the Camp of Israel forthe time had come when it had to be organized according to theorder and law of God for the peace safety and salvation ofthe people. 
 A True Copy of A Revelationgiven atWinter Quarters at Elder Kimball'sJan 14 1847"The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Campof Israel in their journeyings to the West""Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-Day Saints and those who journey with them be organizedinto companies with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandmentsand statutes of the Lord our God. Let the companies be organized withcaptains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens with apresident and his two counsellors at this head under the direction ofthe Twelve Apostles: And this shall be our covenant that we willwalk in all the ordinances of the Lord.Let each company provide themselveswith all the teams waggons provissions clothing and other necessariesfor the journey that they can. When the companies are organizedlet them go to with their might to prepare for those who are totarry. Let each company with their captains and presidentsdecide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficientnumber of able bodied and expert men to take teams seeds and farmingutensils to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in Spring crops.Let each company bear an equal proportion according to the dividend oftheir property in taking the poor the widows the fatherless and thefamilies of those who have gone into the army that the crys of thewidow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lordagainst this peopleLet each company prepare houses and fieldsfor raising grain for those who are to remain behind this season 
 and this is the will of the Lord concerning His people. Let every manLet every man use all his influence and property toremove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion:and if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness ye shall be blessed:you shall be blessed in your flocks and in your lands and in yourfields and in your houses and in your families.Let my servants Ezra T.

Keep yourselves from evil to takenot the name of thy God in vain; for I am the Lord your Godeven the God of your fathers the God of Abraham and of Isaacand of Jacob. I am he who led the children of Israelout of the Land of Egypt and my arm is stretched out in thelast days to save my people IsraelCease to contend one with anothercease to speak evil one of another cease drunkeness and let yourwords tend to edifying one another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbourthou shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed and if thou canstnot repay then go straight way and tell thy neighbour lest hecondemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbourhas lost thou shalt make dilligent search till thou shalt deliverit to him again 
 Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast thatthou mayest be a wise steward for it is the free gift of the Lord thyGod and thou art His steward.If thou art merry praise the Lord withsinging with music with dancing and with a prayer of praise andthanksgiving.

My people must be triedin all things that they may be prepared to receive the Glorythat I have for them even the glory of Zion and he that willnot bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdomLet him that is ignorant learn wisdomby humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God that hiseyes may be opened that he may see and his ears opened that hemay hear; for my spirit is sent forth into the world to enlightenthe humble and contrite and to the condemnation of the ungodlyThy brethren have rejected you and yourtestimony even the nation that has driven you out and nowcometh the day of their calamity even the days of sorrow-likea woman that is taken in travalil and their sorrows shall begreat unless they speedily repent yea very speedily for theykilled the Prophets and they that were sent unto them and theyhave shed inocent blood which criseth from the groundagainst them. Therefore marvel not at those thingsfor ye are not yet pure:  Thou canst not yet bearmy glory but thou shalt behold it if ye are faithful inkeeping all my words that I have given you from the daysof Adam to Abraham from Abraham to Moses from Mosesto Jesus and the Apostles and from Jesus and his Apostlesto Joseph ^Smith^ whom I did call upon by mine angels myministering servants and by mine own voice out of theheavens to bring forth my work which foundation he[pencil beneath - the foundation of which] 
 did lay and was faithful and I took him to myself. Many have marvelledbecause of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony withhis blood that he might be honoured and the wicked might be condemnedHave I not delivered you from your enemies,only in that I have left a witness of my name? Now therefore hearkenO ye people of my Church and ye Elders listen together. You have receivedmy kingdom; be diligent in keeping all my commandments lestjudgement come upon you and your faith fail you and your enemiestriumph over you.So no more at present: Amen and Amen." 
 FebOn the 15th I met in Council with the Presidents and Counsellorscaptains of hundreds Fifties and Tens to farther the organization of the camp ofIsrael: I received an appointment to go to Kegg Creek with brother Smootto organize the people thereNext day was a very interesting day to me. Iattended the family meeting of President Brigham Young and he addressedthe meeting at great length during the day and evening. There werepresent of the quorum of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C. KimballWillard Richards Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A Smith AmasaLyman and Ezra T. Benson.After singing and prayer by President Younghe arose and addressed the meeting and remarked that he had invitedthe Twelve to be present though they were not of his family yet hewished them to act free and speak such things as the Lord shall givethem. He said, "Let me state a principle by which you maycontemplate much. For the word of understanding many havesuffered jealousies to arise which afflicted their minds withborrowed troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved someothers more than themselves. This I have seen in theChurch ever since its rise. It was manifest in Kirtland. Whenthe first Bishop was ordained. This jealous feeling was manifestSome wondered if the Lord would think enough of them to ordain thema Bishop. Father Morley and others who were present can bearrecord of this fact And when the Twelve were chosen the samefeeling existed and in fact I will not except all of them some of whommanifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. ThisSpirit has been the overthrow of many in this Church and in factupon this principle thousands have fallen in all agesThe Lord gives to every man all the powerinfluence and authority he can wield in righteousness and all that hisgoodness and faithfulness merits. Then why should jealousiesarise or what benefit can come by suffering such feelings to existNon at all; but he who cherishes such feelings commences trying 
 to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining influence as Cain didinstead of building up and nourishing every tree and thereby provinghimself worthy and showing to his brethren and to God that he lovesthe cause and by his pasive spirit that he is not only willingthat offers should prosper and gain influence but that he actuallyloves to see them prosper; for then he does all that he can throughhimself if he helps to advance it through others although they receive the honour of it and he still be aware of it. [##Genesis 4:1-16##] Such a man will never beforgotten and to his honour and glory and exaltation there shall beno end.There is another principle that hascaused considerable uneasiness and trouble and that is the idea ofsome men having more wives than one. Such tremendiousfears take hold of some that they hardly know how to live:still they can't die. They began to whisper and talk around: "I amactually affraid to go on a mission for fear some man will be sealedto my wife"; and when they return some will be babling about"You don't know but what you have got another man's wife" andthey are affraid to speak to a young woman for fear that she belongsto some one else or for fear some one else wants her. Others denythe faith as they think (but they never had much) and say that it isall of the devil. To Such foolishness ought not to be cherished amonga wise and prudent people.Admiting the Lord created the same numberof woman as men at the beginning and commanded them to multiplyand replenish the earth and to fill up the measure of their creator inrighteousness the question is did they do it? Answer: No. Theysoon disobeyed every commandment and plunged themselves intowickedness and rendered themselves unworthy to raise up seedunto the Lord and in fact used ever means in their powerto cut off life and hindering women answering the end for whichthey were created. Nine tenths of them would rebel againstthe very thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the 
 Lord calling upon men who hears the Pristhood to take to themselves wives from amongthe daughters of men and raise up a righteous seed unto him that He might fillup the measure of their creation and hasten the consummation of his purposesin righteousness in this dispensation according to His word previously spokenthrough His servants the Prophets.Those who suffer fears and jealousies to arisein their bosoms either back right out or get to be mighty righteous and for fearthey are sleeping with other men's wives they kick up a dust or broil at homeand perhaps abuse their own companion through jealousy then go off tosome woman that does not understand what is right or wrong and tell herthat she cannot be saved without a man and he has almighty powerand can exalt and save her and likely tell that there is no harm for themto sleep together before they are sealed and then go to some dough-headof an Elder and get him to say the ceremony and all done without theknowledge of the Authority of this Church. This is not rightand will not be suffered. The God I serve will reward every manopenly without his being under the necessity of going secretly andprivately proclaiming himself in the creativity of ignorant inocentfemales.Such jealousies do exist and were I to sayto the Elders you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms onehalf of them would lie swear steal and fight like the very devil to getmen and women sealed to them. They would even try to passright by me and go to Joseph thinking to get between him andthe Twelve. Some have already tried to use and influenceagainst me but such jealousies and selfishness shall be stoped andif the brethren do not stop it I will blow it to the four windsby making them all come and be sealed to me and I to my fatherand he and all this Church to JosephWhen I go astray and give wrong counseland lead this people astray then is time enough to pull medown and then God will remove me as He has done all otherswho have turned from the faith. 
 But to return. I have gathered a number of familiesaround me by the law of adoption and seal of the covenant according to theorder of the Priesthood and others have done likewise it being themeans of salvation left to bring us back to God. But had the keysof the Priesthood been retained and handed down from father toson throughout all generations up to the present time then therewould have been no necessity of the law of adoption forwe would have all been included in the covenant withoutit and have been legal heirs instead of being heirs accordingto promise.The Priesthood is eternal; withoutbegining of days or end of life as the Apostle has expressedit; but man through apostacy which is entire disobediencehas lost or suffered the keys and privileges of the Priesthoodto be taken away from them and left to wander in darknessand practise all manner of wickedness until thousandsbecame the vessels of wrath and were doomed to destructionfor as long as men are without the Priesthood They continueto be without God and never retrace their steps until it isdone by the Priesthood. The idea of the Saint beingled by false Prophets is just a notion according to the lightin which they view them. All the false Prophets wehave are the men who have turned away from the truth.The man is the head and god of thewoman but let him act like God in virtuous principles andGodlike conversation walk and department. Such men will continueto gain influence and power and advance in glory to all eternityBut should they use their power in wickedness as a tyrant they will soonbe called to render an account of their stewardship. If notfound worthy they will be hurled down to perdition and theirfamily and kingdom be given to another that is worthy. Somesay that a woman cannot be saved without a man: neither can a man without a woman. 
 Brother Joseph said he had taught the Twelve all he knewconcerning the order of the kingdom but the difficulty was they could notremember it as he told them but when it was necessary they wouldnot be at a loss for understanding. And I bear record of the truthof his word before God this day that I always had an understanding andeverything was brought them to my mind just as he taught them ^it^ tous. All the ordinances of the Temple and building of the altar &ccame to me just right when they were to be attended to and could wenow know brother Hyde Pratt and Taylors feelings you would saythat they could read a man through as soon as they cast their eyes uponhim.The Apostle Paul while speaking of the Fathersand the ancients said that they without us could not be made perfect. [##Hebrews 11:40##]There was a lack in his story and still will be to all eternity untilthe chain of that Priesthood is restored and every spirit take a tabernaclethat was forordained according to the dispensation of the will of God.I am entitled to the keys of the Priesthoodaccording to linage and blood. So is brother Heber C. Kimballand many othersâ€”and have taken ^the various^ kingly power and grades of the Priesthood. This we would have taught in the Templehad time permitted. Joseph Smith was entitled to the keysof the Priesthood according to blood. Still he was the fourth son.But when we get another Temple built then we will teach youconcerning these things. Suffice it to say that I will extendthe chain of the Priesthood back through the Apostlolic Dispensationto Father Adam just as soon as I can get a Temple built.Jesus could have restored the order of the Priesthood in his day and brought in the Millenium if thepeople would have hearkened to his instructions but they rebelled andwould not and it was for this cause that Jesus told themthat all the blood which had been shed from righteousAbel down to Zachariel the Prophet should be requiredat their hands. [##Matthew 23:34-35##] 
 I have a request to make of my family and thatis that they (especially old people omit calling me their father.Call me Brother Brigham. I shall fell better when yo[u] dofor I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation. Fatherin the Priesthood implies the great Head. The term would beproper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference to the samething when he told his disciples not to call any man fatheron earth for their Father was in heaven.The seal of the covenant that Ihave been speaking of to day was what the Apostle sawprevious to the destruction of the wicked when the angelwas commanded not to pour out the viall of wrath upon thewicked until the Saints were sealed in their foreheadsand when this was done they all became Father Adam'sfamily.Those that ^belong to^ are adopted into my familyand take me for their Councillor if I continue faithful Iwill preside over them throughout all eternity. I willstand at their head and Joseph will stand at the headof this Church and will be the President & Prophet and Godto the people in this dispensation.When we locate I will settlemy family down in the order and teach them their duty.They will then have to provide temporal blessings forme instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons asI now do. I will administer in spiritual blessingsto them. I expect to live in the House of theLord and receive and administer ordinances to my brethrenand for the dead all the year round."President H.C. Kimball and OrsonPratt then address briefly President Young's familymeeting and then there was an intermission until 
 after supper.The table was will furnished and supplied.Forty persons could be seated at the table at a time. The menwere seated to the right with their companions opposite to themcommencing with the Twelve President Young at their head; then in orderthe ^rest^ adopted children begining with the 1st that was adopted. Theband and choir kept their seats and discoursed their sweet strain ofmusic while the guest were partaking of the rich festival.While at table brother Thomas Wolsleyand John H Tippetts came in. They were direct from theMormon Battalion 280 miles south of Santa Fe on the riverRio Grande on the 10th of Nov. 1846. they had piloted fifty sixsick men to Fort Pueblo where Cap Brown's estableshment wasstationed. From thence they came in on packmules were50 days on the way and were taken prisoners twice by theIndians and once was sentenced to death by the Pawnees. Forthirty days they were without bread and five days were withoutmuch of anything to eat. These brethren brought a packageof 137 letters and a good account from Fort Pueblo but ratherunfavorable from the Battalion who were described as resemblingmountineers in their persons.The arrived of these brethren in thecamp produced no small stir. Men and women came fromall directions to enquire after their friends in the army.After the men were refreshed we wentinto council with them and they rehearsed the salvation of the Battalion.The brethren composing it had been on half rations for three weekswhen they left them and no prespects of more than half rationsshould they attempt to cross the mountains that Winter. Reporthowever had reached Santa Fe when they arrived that theBattalion had taken the Alpasio a strong hold between theRio Grande and the Mountains without the firing of a gunPresident Young said that if they had hearkened to his counsel 
 not a man of them would have fallen but would all have returned to theirfriends in perfect safety.We returned to the Council House at 7 o'clock.The Saints were rejoicing in what they had heard that day and after ElderIsaac Morley had expressed himself upon the occassion President Youngarose and continued his remarks upon the Law of adoption."The Lord introduced the law of adoption for thebenefit of the children of men as a schoolmaster to bring them backinto the covenant of the Priesthood. This principle I amaware is not clearly understood by many ^of the^ Elders in this churchat the present time as it will hereafter be: and I confess thatI have only a smattering of those things; but when it isnecessary I will attain to more knowledge upon the subjectand consequently shall be enabled to teach and practice more.In the mean time glorify God the bountiful Giver.I have heard Elders say they werenot dependant upon any man. It was saying more thanI can say for I consider that we are all dependant oneupon another for our exaltation and that our interest isinseperably connected. For example: What can my familydo without me. Supposing they were to all turn awayfrom me. I hold the keys over them through which they are to receivetheir exaltation. Would they not be like sheep without a shepherd?and be devoured by the wolves? They certainly would. Thenlet us change the position and say that I would cut off all myfamily then what glory would I have with no body to rule overbut my own dear little self. To tell you my feelingsI would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation.This is another proof of the Apostle'ssaying when he declared that they without us could not be madeperfect. Neither can you without me nor I withoutyou that is to say if we are faithful for without faithfullness 
 there is no perfection on any consideration.This rule applies to the whole human family.This is the torment and misery of the disobedient spirits that they cannotbe made perfect unless some scheme should hereafter be introducedfor their redemption.They are now without tabernacles to dwell inonly such as they have taken possession of unlawfully and usurpedpower over. It is a part of their agency that was allowed them whichthey use to the consummation of their unhappy and wretched estate itbeing the reward and fruits of their doings having been given over toall manner of wickedness and permitted to afflict the handy work of theLord until they fill up the cup of their iniquity. Then the Lordwill say unto them, "Thou wicked and disobedient spirit thoushalt not have power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the worksof my hands: you have forfeited your agency and wrought your fulness;depart hence to the pit that I have prepared for thee.This is their torment that their powerand agency is taken from them and they are left to regret that itwas through their own disobedience they cut the thread of their ownsalvation. This reflection only serves to torture andincrease their torment.And this would be the situation of myfamily were they to cut themselves off from me. I use my familyas an example not that I have the least fears, of their ever doingso, for I have none.I feel happy this night because we areof one mind. Still should I believe that we were perfect andcould not advance any farther I should not be happy. But tothe honour power and glory of the faithful there is no end.For your satisfaction I will show youa rule by which you may comprehend the exaltation of thefaithful. I will use myself as a figure and say that I amruling over ten sons or subjects and soon each of them would have 
 ten more sealed to them and they would be rulers over them and thatwould make me ruler over ten Presidents or kings whereas I was rulerover ten subjects only: or in other words I ruled over one kingdombut now I should rule over ten. Then let each get ten morethen I should be ruler over one hundred kingdoms and so on continuedto all eternity. The more honour and glory that I couldbestow upon my sons the more it would add to my exaltationbut to clip the thread of your exaltation then where would beyour glory? It would be like the fallen angels or devilsthat kept not their first estate but were reserved ineverlasting chains of darkness unto the judgement of thegreat day. Others fell from heaven were thrust downto hell. But if you wish to advance hold up thehands of your file leader. Should you have ten legionsof trains following on after you, you should say toyour file leader push ahead for I am coming withmy train lifting him up at the same time instead oftrying to pass by him. This would stimulate him and he would say come on my boys I will travelas fast as you can and on we would go in one solidtrain to all eternity.Before I close I will answer onequestion that has been asked me repeatedly. Should I havea father dead who has never heard this gosepl wouldit be required of me to redeem him and have him adoptedinto some man's family and I be adopted unto my fatherI answer no.If we have to attend to the ordinancesof redemption for our dead relatives we then become theirsaviors and were we to wait to redeem our dead relativesbefore we could link the chain of the Priesthood we would neveraccomplish it."Many other remarks were made 
 and at the close there was a little exercise by music and dancing anothermeeting was dismissed.Brother Smoot and myself left Winter quarterson the 18th on our mission to Keg Creek. We rode to CouncilPoint the first day where we found that Branch assembled for meetingWe addressed the meeting and I read the revelation given at WinterQuarters and took a note upon it.Next day we travelled to MiskitoeCreek and on the following one we visited the Branch ofthe Church in that place and organized it according to the patterngiven. We then drove our team to Keg Creek. There wasa snow storm during the day and our horses sufferedmuch on the journey in the storm.On the Sunday I met with the Branchat Keg Creek and addressed the congregation in much plainnessand rebuked some false spirits and was followed by ElderSmoot. We took the names for organizing and rodetwelve miles back to brother Petty's and spent the night. We hadabout 2 feet of snow to travel through.Next day was very cold but we travelled30 miles through the snow to Winter Quarters.During the next ten days I met severaltimes with the 1st Division and captains of hundreds in furtheringthe organization and its design and again on the 4th of Marchmet in council with the first division and several speeches weremade by several of the brethren concerning our location inWinter Quarters & our journey westward. President Youngsaid he should go as he was directed by the Lord andhe requested The Saints to be ready to start on the 15th.On Sunday the 11th I met with theSaints in our Ward. Bishop Smoot addressed the peopleI followed and required the people who had means to carrysomething to the Bishop for the poor and after meetings I 
 went home and took for my part flour meal sugar and coffee forthat object to the Bishop and then myself and brother Smootand I myself took of the substance donated for the poor and visitedthe sick and administered to them spiritually and temporally.About this time brothers McCray andLummeroux arrived in camp from Nauvoo. McCrayhad been in prison and many of the brethren had been imprisonedand some hung by the mob until they were nearly dead.I spent the 12th in preparing mycarriage to go with the Pioneer Company and spent thenext day in council with the Twelve and captains ofHundreds for adopting measures for the government of thepeople after we left.The 15th was spent in Council withthe Twelve and Captains of Hundreds upon the movementbefore us and the meeting was addressed by President Youngand a number of others.The next two days wasere occupied inpreparing for our journey; and on the following one I wasunwell but attended a musical concert in the Council Housein the evening though I had to return home and go tobed being so ill.I was somewhat better two dayslater and continued preparing for the Pioneer journey, Thisand attended the funeral of sister Phebe Traine. There was atthis time much sickness and death in the camp.Sunday the 21st the camp of Israelassembled in a general meeting on the public square, PresidentYoung addressed the congregation upon a variety of subjects.We also met in Council but not much business was done.There was a severe snow storm during the night.The next morning was very cold; butthere was a meeting of the Presidency and captains of company's 
 and it was resolved to stockade the city of Winter Quarters and for the Twelveto go forward to pick out a resting place for the Saints. In theevening I attended a council of the Bishops and Twelve; and a variety ofsubjects was brought up.President Young spoke upon Patriarchalblessings and the blessing of children and said that any fatherwho held the Priesthood was a Patriarch to his own family andwhen he blessed his children it was a Patriarchal blessing. Ifa man wrote the blessing of his children and could get theHistorian to record it that was all right enough but the Historiancould not write all the blessings in the Church.Next day the Presidency and Bishopsmet to decide where the lines of the city should be and two dayslater the Camp of Israel held a public meeting.In the evening I met with my companyand expressed my feelings to them concerning labouring togetherfor the season in raising grain and taking care of the familesof those who were going in the Pioneer company. Thespirit of union prevailed in the matter.On the 27 I attended the funeral ofsister Burnham and took the family to the grave and then returnedand let George A. Smith have my team to go to the grave tobury one of his family.The Sacrament for the First Time in Winter Quarters.Sunday the 28th was a fine day and thecamp met at the public stand and in the morning brothersYoung Kimbal Pratt and Benson addressed the meeting.In the afternoon we partook of thesacrament and the assembly was addressed by Elder WoodruffSmith Lyman Willard Richards Phelps and President Young. Thiswas the first time the sacrament had been administered 
 to the Saints in a general Assembly in Winter Quarters.In the evening I visited the sick andadministered to five persons and met with the Twelve High Counciland Bishops.Next morning I met with the PresidencyCaptains of Hundreds and Pioneer Company and it wasfinally agreed that those who were ready should start on the morrow for theHorn. It was fine weather.On the evening of the last of the monthI was with the Presidency and Captains of Hundreds in Council andexpressed my mind with others upon the subject of ^stockading^ barracadingthe city and uniting together in labour in cultivating the earth.President Young spoke upon the subject.As the close of this Council thequorum of the Twelve met and resolved that Brother W.W. Phelpsgo to the East and procure a Printing Press and type andreceive a recommendation to that effect.On the 1st of April I sat for alikeness to be taken by Major to be put into a plate withothers of the Twelve. In the afternoon I met in council withthe Twelve. Elder Stratton who had just arrived fromSt Louis was present and gave an account of the affairs ofthe Church in that city. We received a mail of paperscontaining the war news &c which we read with greatinterest in our isolated life.On the 2nd a portion of the Pioneerscommenced removing the out houses ^on the outskirts^ unto a line in thecity. I spent a part of the day in the office reading thenews and a part in writing in my Journal and an epistleto my family and capatains of my company giving anaccount of my affairs which I was leaving behind. 
 The following was a busy day in preparing for ourjourney. The Pioneers were now about to start to go to the Mountainsof Israel to find a location and a resting place for the Saints while thejudgements of God are poured out upon the earth. The burden andcares of the Church and my family rested heavily upon my mind andI never felt more in leaving my family to go on a mission thannow but I prayed that the Lord would sustain them as he had donein the many missions which I had taken. I assisted brother Richardsin the evening to pack up his waggon.Next day was Sunday and I went to theriver and baptised 3 persons members brother Dewey's family andI also confirmed them.Our Annual ConferenceatWinter QuartersApril the 6th 1847As usual the Church held its annual conference onthe anniversary of the organization of Church of Jesus Christof Latter-Day Saints on the 6th of April 1830. Thisyear it was held at Winter Quarters where the body ofthe Church had located for the season on its way to theRocky Mountains to find at new home.It was a fine morning; the sunshone brightly the Heavens smiled upon us and our heartswere made glad. There was not much business done.President Young addressed the Assembly with good sounddoctrine and the Conference voted to sustain the quorumof the Twelve and the rest of the quorums and authoritiesof the Church.I spent the afternoon in preparing to startfor the Rocky Mountains on the morrow. 
 The PioneersLeaving Winter QuartersApril 7th 1847The day after the General Conference I tookleave of my family and friends and started with my companyof Pioneer waggons 8 in number and left Winter Quarters forour journey to the Mountains to select a location for theChurch and prepare for the body of the Saints to follow.When we were on the top of theridge west of the city I took a view of the city and lookedat my wife and children though my glass. I then ledthe company to the old camp ground from thence on thePunkaw road about 7 miles and camped for the night, tenmiles from Winter Quarters.We had excellent stables for ourhorses in a valley near a small stream of water. Wehad not been camped long before Brother Pratt and hiscompany arrived and close upon them President Young andhis Company so we all camped together about 25 waggonsof us and it was a very windy night.In the morning we arose and tookbreakfast. A squirel was killed and it being the firstgame killed by the Pioneer Companies I moved that thefirst fruits of the game be offered to the Priest: so it waspresented to President Young for his breakfast.President Young Father Morley and otherswent to the old camping ground to pick them out a place fora farm and I with several others spent the day in huntingcould but caught nothing but weary limbs and wet feet. We sawhowever deer geese ducks &c. 
 Commence hereWhen I returned to camp in the evening from ourunsuccessful hunting expedition I learned that Parley P. Pratt had arrivedat Winter Quarters from his mission to England, and that President YoungOrson Pratt and others had gone back to the city to see him.In the morning I mounted my horseand started for Winter Quarters to see brother Parley the Twelve myfamily and others. Mrs Woodruff was at our camp the day beforewhile I was out hunting and left a letter for me in answer to theone I had written to her.Before I got to the city I met theTwelve. I was within half a mile of home yet I turned aboutwith them returned to the camp of pioneers harnessed ourhorses and drove until dark 10 miles towards the Horn leavingbrothers Young and Kimball several miles behind.Early the next morning we starteddrove to the Horn and crossed it with all ^our^ teams ^on a raft^ before sunset.The following was Sunday. We crossedover 20 waggons in the morning and then Presidents Youngand Kimball arrived with their companions and wecontinued to ferry them until they were all over. We moveddown our encampment 2 miles and spent the night.Next day the encampment moved up the Platte 14 miles; but the quorum of the Twelve and others recrossedthe Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. Four of us followedan Indian trail and cut off 15 miles. It was 35 miles by thewaggon route but only 20 the way we went.I was very busy the next day paintingone of my waggons to take away and sell. I got another horseto take away with me and was in council with the quorumof the Twelve until midnight. Elder John Taylor was withus. He arrived in the city in the evening on this returnfrom England. We were all glad to meet him once more.He brought for our use on this Pioneer journey two Sextants 
 two baromaters two artificial horizons one circle of reflectionand one telescope, all of which were exhibited to us in theevening and boxed up so that we could take them along.Next day I called together my familyand blessed my wife and children and left them in thehands of the Lord. I bade farewell to Father Woodruffand family and all around me and took my leaveof Winter Quarters and in company with Elders O PrattA. Lyman G. A Smith E. Snow and others we againtook the Indian trail and rode through the Prairie toElk Horn and went over on a raft and camped two milesbelow the Ferry. We had an excellent supper offried catfish pork beans short-cake honeycomb coffeemilk &c. We all eat very hearty. had prayers & retired to bed.Professor O Pratt the next morningtook an observation for the correct time. Brothers YoungKimball and Whitney and others came and crossed the ferryand we all moved up to the general camp on the PlatteRiver 9 miles in advance of us. We found the campvery busy in blacksmith work preparing to ^continue^ contue ourjourney.Brother Jesse C. Little arrived fromthe Eastern States in our midst. Finding us not atWinter Quarters he followed and overtook us this evening. Hegave us news of the Eastern Churches and brought a remembranceto the quorum of the Twelve from our friend Col. Kanein a variety of presents to us. The Col. had sent me apatent life preserver and a stop-compass.Brothers Little Rockwell and Readingreturned to Winter Quarters next morning and the camp continued4 miles up the Platte.Before we left this morning the campcame together and was organised the for journeying as a military 
 as a military body into companies of hundreds fifties and tens.but Stephen Markham and A.P. Rockwood were appointedcaptains of hundreds. I was appointed captain of Ten and thefollowing are the names: Wilford Woodruff J.S. Fowler J BurnhamOrson Pratt Joseph Egbert John M. Freeman Marcus B. Thorp GeorgeA Smith and George Wardle being 9 in all.The camp consisted of 73 waggons 143 men 3 womenand two children making in all 148 souls.We travelled 8 miles next day and campedin the border of a grove of cottonwood to spend the Sabbath. In theafternoon the organization of the camp was completed according to thefollowing order: Brigham Young Lieutenant General Stephen MarkhamColonel John Pack 1st Major Shedrick Rounday 2nd Major.The Regment to be divided into tens under the following captains:Wilford Woodruff capt. of 1st companyEzra T. Benson - 2nd comp. Phineas H Young 3rd co.Luke Johnson 4th Stephen H. Godard 5thCharles Shumway 6th James Case 7thSeth Taft 8th Howard Egan 9thAppleton M. Harmon 10th John Higby 11thNorton Jacobs 12th John Brown 13thJoseph Mathews 14th.General Orders for the CampOrders from General Young was for the whole regimentto journey in a compact body as we were in an Indian countryand for every man to carry his gun loaded the cap locks tobe shut on a piece of buckskin with caps ready to slip on atthe instant in case of attack, for flint locks with cotton or towin the pan and powder flask always handy to prime quicklyand for every man to walk by the side of his waggon and notto leave it except sent away by order. The object of all thiscaution was to prevent accident for strict discipline was necessarywhile travelling through a hostile Indian country. 
 Some traders came down from the Pawnees and campedwith us over night. They had plenty of Buffaloo meat dried and they gaveus what we wished and informed us that we were within two daysdrive of the whole ^a large band^ of the Pawnees. We camped here ina line for the Sabbath.Sunday the 18 President Young calledthe captains together and gave them instructions concerning our travel.We were to start in the morning two abreast all who were not drivingteams were to carry their guns and walk by the side of the waggonsand no man to go hunting to get out of sight of the camp. Inthe ^evening^ morning the bugle was to be blown at ^5 o'clock^ half past 8 o'clock andthe camp to arise and pray cook eat feed horses harness them &and start at the call of the bugle at 7 o'clock and at nightthe bugle was to be blown at half past eight when all wasere togo to prayers in their several waggons and retire to bed by9 o'clock. Each Saturday night we were to pitchour tents or camp in our waggons and rest forrom our journeyon the Sabbath. This was the order of The Camp.It was quite cold on Monday morning.The bugle blew at five o'clock for prayers and at seven for starting.We travelled according to general orders and bore a no[r]therly directionuntil about noon when we reached the north bend of the Platte10 1/2 miles north of the ford. Professor Pratt took anobservation and found it to be in Lat. 41. 27. 5.: The crossingplace of the Horn was in Lat. 41. 16. 24., making the NorthBend of the Platt 10 1/2 miles north of the ford. We formeda circle at noon and baited.While nooning Elder Little P. Rockwelland two others arrived and brought the meal. I receivedtwo letters one from my wife and one from Leonard Hardyof Mass who informed me that Milton Homes and his fatherand mother had turned strangites and been cut off the church.Brother Little brought with him 
 many things that Col. T Kane had sent as presents to the Twelve and others. Irecieved a stop-box marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket.It was a splendid present.We camped at night near a grove of timber onthe bank of the Platte where we formed a circle on the edge of the bank.The river on one side was our defence and the forewheel of each waggon wasdrove up to the hinder wheel of the one before it and all the horsesand cattle taken inside of the corrall: so that we were secure againstthe Indians.There was a hard wind during the night andthe morning was fair but a strong south ^west^ wind which covered our waggonswith sand dust.The grass was now about 4 inches high s[c]atteringand there was not half feed for our animals so all along thus far wehad to cut down cottonwood trees &c to feed them and the horseswould knaw off the bark from brouse limbs as readilyas they would eat corn of which we gave to each horse 2 quartsper day.We started on our journey 2 1/2 miles andcame to another grove of small and large cottonwood coveringabout 40 acres. It was about 5 miles to the tablelandwhich was now rising into a bluff. Here the road runs 20degrees south of the west Bending to S. by W. one mile inwhich distance we passed three Islands in the Platte coveredwith timber the largest of which was about ten acres andthere continues a chain of Islands for miles along the riverand some timber on the south side of the Platte.Three miles from our last encampmentwe came to Shell Creek and one and half miles from ShellCreek is a Prairie Dog village covering about 6 acres of ground.This Creek was timbered only by a few scattering willows. andthe river was about parallelAfter crossing Shell Creek bridge the 
 road runs about S.W. by W. 60 degrees west of South for about 15 miles.The Platt is skirted bywith timberProfessor Pratt and myself went forwardof the company to take observations. After travelling 13 miles westoped baited horses and took observations. The company approached usand we continued on 5 miles and the whole encampment came up andwe camped for the night in a cirlce and cut down cottonwood trees tofeed our horses.The following day was A cloudy day was the next one with a light sprinkling of rain and wind in the east and our course westward.The teams started at 7 o'clock and the horse teams between 8 and 9.An Indian appeared on a mound mounted on a poney about 5 milesfrom us. He went out of sight and again appeared. He thenapproached the camp full speed was met by the brethren andshook hands and was followed by seven others. They went throughthe encampment and then returned with us.We travelled til half past 12 o'clock whenwhen we came in sight of 70 Indian horses and mules and soon insight of a large Pawnee village on the North side of Loop Fork andalso one on the south side of it. We drove on by the villagesand they soon began to sally out to come to us and we campedin the form of a half moon the bank of the river forminga parallel line in front.The Indians to the number of about200 0n the South side of the river came down to the shore. Somewaded over and about 75 came into camp including the grand chiefof the nation with many war chiefs. We met them beforewe left the ground and made them presents of 4 1 lbs of tobacco15 lbs of lead powder fishhooks beads flour salt &c but stillthey were not satisfied. Considering our numbers they thoughtthey ought to have had more.When we left the ground theIndians oppeared very disatisfied but we harnessed up our teams 
 and drove on to Lookingglass Creek and camped at its mouth for the night uponthe bank of the Loop Fork.After our horses were turned out we were calledtogether and in consequence of the disatisfaction of the Indians  a guard of 100men was called for. The quorum of the Twelve with nearly the wholecamp volunteered to stand guard one half of them the forepart of thenight and the other the latter part. We also had a picket guard offive men with their mules at each watch.I was one of the picket guard. We hada hard wind and rain in the afternoon which continued a portion ofthe time that I was on guard. I rolled myself up in my buffalorobe and let the wind and rain beat on to me. We were releasedat about 1 o'clock and went to rest; but no Indians appeared during the night.Looking Glass Creek was crossed 15 minutesbefore 9 on the morrow and a westerly course continued and BeaverCreek reached at noon. There was a good many otter on the Lookingglass and Beaver about a mile above the mouth of BeaverCreek.Professor O. Pratt took the meridian observationof the sun by the sextant for the Lat. which was found to be41Â° 25' 15". We also found the magnetic needle tovary about 12 degrees east  and also made other observationsfor the time &c.We crossed ^Beaver^ Beverer Creek at half past two o'clocktravelled seven miles and came to the Pawnee Missionary Stationand camped for the night. The Bluff was skirted with someoaks on the north side of the road in the hills. We kept out a guardthrough the night as we were in danger of the Sioux on the oneside and the Pawnees on the other.While watering the horses at the creek atthe station this evening brother George A Smith's horse miredpitched forward and jumped on to him treading upon his feet and 
 breast and holding him fast in the mud while I caught the horse by the bit andbacked him off. I was fearful that brother Smith was badly injuredbut found that he was not.Ch. 26A Day of Adventures.April the 23The next day was one of adventures to the Pioneercompany. In the morning 12 of us started on horse back tosearch out a ford across the dangerous and troublesome Loop Forkup the Platte River.We went down the River some distanceand several men waded across and found the water so deep and so much quicksand that we came to the conclusion to drive upto the old Pawnee Village. So we returned to the camp andharnessed up our horses.My gray horse named Titus had the was sick yet I started out with him and the camp droveup with some little difficulty to the old Indian village or a littlebelow it and men commenced searching out a ford and found thewhole bed of the river one body of quicksand into which if a horseor waggon stoped it would begin to sink down.We had two channels of water to crosswith a sand bar in the middle. The deepest water was from 3to 4 feet deep and very rapid and about 300 yards across. Atsome places the quicksand sank both man and beast instantly andthe more they struggled to get out the more they would sink. Ofcourse we avoided such places as much as possible.As I led the van with my ten beingthe 1st ten it fell to my lot to make the first trial. ProfessorO. Pratt having a strong pair of horses went forward and I followedhim. I had two yoke of cattle and my horses on mycarriage with about ten hundred on it.As soon as I started I immediately 
 saw that the cattle did but little good being slow and in the way. We would stopand begin to sink. I jumped out of my carriage into the water up to mywaist and about ten men came to my assistance with a drag rope andhitched it to the oxen and assisted me in getting across the first streamthough with great difficulty.We stoped on a sand bar out of the waterbut my horses and waggon began to sink. By treading the ground a littleit would become a perfect quagmire; yet though we were sinking in itthe men had to leave the waggon where it was and go to the assistanceof Orson Pratt who in trying to cross the second stream had sunk intoa bed of quicksand and all the men had to go to his relief to get his horsesand waggon out. The horses were unhitched from the wagon andthe load taken out and carried to shore by hand and the waggon drawnout by the help of men.I took off a part of my load in fact mostof it in a boat and went through the second stream nearly empty andgot out two other waggons done in the same way but it was soterrific and undertaking that the rest of the camp would not follow in our track.So here we found ourselves on the oppositeside of the River 6 men of us to spend the night together with our horsesand waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band then campedbelow us on the same side of the river; and it was supposed theynumbered 600 warriors. We divided our company making threeon guard at a time.Brother Pack Orson Pratt and myself went.on guard the forepart of the night. Although I had been in thewater the whole of the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothingone half of the night and slept in them the other half.We had not more than got our portion ofthe night through when we were joined by five men from the camp who crossed in a boat and were sent by President Youngto assist us making eleven of us in all and we divided one force 
 accordingly. The night however passed off in peace and ^no^ disturbance fromhostile Indians.The morning when it came was pleasant and ProfessorPratt took and ^an^ observation on the south bank of the fording place on the LoopFork. and The Lattitude was found to be 4^1^4Â° 22' 37"The camp on the other side were nowbusy in devising plans to cross the River. They drew togethertimber and rails to build two rafts and began to put it together butsome of the brethren made another trial to cross with waggons byputting on several horse and mule teams.They went a little higher up than wedid and got over with much less difficulty and the more the groundas trod in the water the smoother and harder it grew. So thewhole encampment turned their waggons back to the ford and abbandonedthe raft. By unloading one half of the baggage they could crossin safety and the whole came over by doubling teams and bygoing back and forth until all were over each captain with histen assisting each other across. So in this way all Israelwho were present went over (not Jordan) but the Loop Fork ofthe Platte River in safety without hurt to man or beast andthey felt thankful to God for his mercies and rejoiced that theywere on the south side of the river.We all loaded up our waggons anddrove 4 miles and camped for the Sabbath on the bank ofthe River and after our waggons were arranged the Twelve tooka walk on the high table land to make observations with ourglasses of the surrounding country.Sunday came with a pleasent morning.The order of the Pioneer Camp was that there should be no fishinghunting nor labour of any kind on The Sabbath except thatwhich was absolutely needed.Four Antelopes appeared before us onthe plain on the opposite side of the river. We could see them 
 with the naked eye but much better through our spyglasses. This was the firstantelope I ever saw. About 10 o'clock  4 Elk also appeared on the oppositeside and we viewed them with our glasses and these were the first ElkI had ever seen.After making the Sabbath a day of rest both for man and beast until 4 o'clock the Camp gathered together for a meeting and were addressed by a number of the brethren; theguards were placed out as usual to guard the Camp at night and a companyof hunters appointed to go forward of the company for game. Therewere 7 horsemen and 10 footmen appointed and the quorum ofthe Twelve had the privilage of joining than when they pleased.Indian AttacksEarly in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians creptupon their hands and knees approaching the camp to steal horses. Theygot within 3 rods of the guard before they were discovered. The guardfirst thought them to be wolves and snapped at them. They rose up andran. Two of the guards fired and 4 others rose up out of the grass.The bugle was sounded and all arose to arms not knowing but there wasa large party near by; but no more were seen there.I started out in the morning with the Hunters.We saw 8 deer & 4 antelopes but caught nothing. Eight miles travel and wecamped for noon. On the opposite of the river were relics of an oldIndian town.In the afternoon we travelled 7 miles and campedon Clear Creek with a hard gravel bottom the first of the kind we hadmet on the road. We killed one wild goose and saw fresh signs ofbuffalo where we camped being the first we had seen. Brothers YoungKimball Richards and myself went on to a high bluff to view the country.Just at dusk a tremd^i^ous alarm wasgiven through the Camp that Indians had cralled up and taken PorterRockwell and his horse and made off with him. Many men mounted 
 their horses and made after hime with all speed but it was soon discovered that Rockwell was in camp but that two horses were goneDr Richard's and brother Little's. About 20 men mounted andarmed went in search of the horses.On the morrow we continued our journeya south course to try to get on the Platte River came on to somebeautiful green grass saw a great quantity of Buffalo signs butfound no wood nor water. We baited our horses in a greenvalley after 12 miles travel.Just as we were starting in the afternoonwe rose unto a small bluff and saw two antelopes in the valleybefore us. Brothers Young Kimball and myself were together. BroBrown and another brother was on the other side of the hills and sawthem. Brother Brown first fired on one and the other man andmyself fired. We all hit him with our balls but he didnot fall; we rose up and cut his throat. This wasThe First Antelope Killed.He was dressed and put on board the waggons and we continued onand in a short time saw three more at the top of a moundlooking at us. Brother Brown and myself went after them butcould not get them so we: so we turned about 10 degrees East ofSouth and went to the Creek and camped. Our cattle and horseswere very dry not finding any water through the day.We had a heavy storm of thunder lightningwind and some rain which lasted about an hour. A rifle ballwent off in brother Brown's waggon by accident and the ballwent through a bag of clothes set it on fire then through thewaggon and broke the leg of a fine horse and the result wasthe breaking up of one of the teams of the Pioneer Company.Brother Rockwell and 3 others had gonein the morning again in search of the ho[r]ses which the Indians 
 could not shoot them. We shot 4 geese. I shot two of them and onedeer but did not get the deer.30 We travelled 16 miles next day and campedwithout wood or water and the grass short affording but little feed.Our First Buffalo Hunt.May 1st 1847This was an interesting day to the Hunters of the Camp of Israel who put out and the camp started on the journey before breakfast travelled 6 miles and camped on the prairie insight ofA Herd of Buffalo Feeding on the Bluff to our rightThey were about 200. Three only of the hunters started out afterthem who rode near and left their horses and crawled upon themto get a shot but they frightened the herd and they ran away.A little before the main herd beingseen three Bulls were discovered on the bluff. OP. Rockwell and twoothers went after them and wounded two but got neither.We had not travelled more than two milesfarther before we discovered another large herd five miles ahead ofus. The hunters gathered together and held a council andwaited until the camp came up. We were determined to getsome of the Buffalo if possible.We travelled with the camp until withina mile of the herd when a halt was made and 15 huntersstarted out. Amasa Lyman and myself of the quorum of the Twelve were with them. We all travelled together on to the Bluffwithin a few rods of the herd and then divided out. BrotherGrover and Luke Johnson went together into the Bluff; OP. Rockwelland brother Brown took the entire left and so we divided into companies on the righ left and centre. I was with the companyin the centre of the herd 
 We all made a charge upon them from the Bluffs andrushed on to the plain. The herd ran very fast down the ruff bluffs intothe plain but when we reached the plain we soon overtook them and eachcompany singled out its game. We made choice of cows generally; thenrushed up by the side of them and fired upon them with our pistolssuch as horse pistols & rifle pistols which we found much better tocarry that rifles which were cumbersome running.The first we gave chaise to was a Buffalocow with her calf. I rode by the side of her and fired two ballswhich took effect and the other brethren with me also fired until shewas killed. We cut her throat.I then ran my horse to the assistance of anotherparty who had wounded one and that was also soon dispatched. Ithen saw that O.P. Rockwell had three bulls at bay on the prairie andBrother Pack and myself ran our horses to his assistance and brotherKimball came up at the same time.We surrounded them and commenced firingupon them. They bolted a-head. I put spurs to my horse andran in front and was in about a rod of them when they all pitchedat me and gave me chase for fight. I had to be quick to getout of the way but I soon cleared them. Two broke for the bluffand brother Brown put for them but Rockwell Kimball Pack and myself stuck to the old bull. I fired 2 balls into him, BroKimball one and Bro Pack one and the bull fell dead and wecut his throat. We also shot a calf that was with him.By this time the two that had left us andafter which Brother Brown was gone was more than a mile distantin the Bluffs. Brother Kimball and myself gave chase tothem and when we were within 20 rods of the bluff we sawtwo come out and run for the main herd to which we gave chasefor awhile but they were fresh and my horse had ran nearlyten miles in the chase; so we gave up the pursuit.I returned to Brother Brown in the Bluff 
 and found that one of the bulls to which he gave chase was ^wounded^ nearly ^dead^ killedand had laid down but Brother Brown having no more powder or ballbefore I aflrrived the bull had got up again and ran into the herd on theBluff. So we all returned on our chase ground to gather up themeat we had killed being 3 cows ^3^ one bull[s] and five calfs makingeleven in all.Brother Soloman Hancock went out in the morningto kill buffalo on foot. He did not come in at night and wefelt concerned about him; but in the morning he returned havingkilled a 3 year old cow and watched her during the night tokeep the wolves from the eating her. Three wolves came uponhim. He shot one and the rest ran away.This made 12 Buffalo in all thatthe Hunters which killed on their first day's Buffalo chase andwe considered this pretty well seeing that we were all strangers tothe Buffalo hunt and but very few of us had ever seen one beforein our lives.We dressed our meat and waggons camefrom the camp to take it in.A part of our chase was through an immenseprairie dog town nearly ten miles long and 2 wide with burrowsnearly at every rod and great danger of the horses steping intothem and falling. My horse ran into me and was near fallingbut no harm was met by any of the hunters. This was thefirst Buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw.The next day was Sunday and all werebusy cooking and saving their meat and in the afternoon we movedthree miles up for better feed and camped by the side of a largeslough of water. Our last camping place was at the head ofGrand Island. Professor Pratt took an observation and found itto agree with Fremont's observation taken two miles south of ourcamping ground on the south side of the river.Soon after we camped a herd of 
 Buffalo came from the Bluff to the river to drink within about 2 miles and thenreturned to the Bluffs. Some were anxious to go after them but as it wasSunday President Young thought it best to let them be until to morrow.The Indians set fire to the prairie before us whichburned rapidly over a large region of country. Brothers Young Kimball and others went in the evening several miles on the road to examine the fireand other things.Monday morning the hunters were called 20 in number to go into the Bluff for a still hunt for buffalo and othergame. We started out with two waggons to bring in the game.I had taken a severe cold which had settled inmy side where my bones were broken last fall and it made me sick andI was unfit for the hunt yet I started with the Hunters though Ihad jarred myself badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday andwas now feeling its effects.At the same time the hunters started anothercompany was formed to explore the route and see if we could get grassfor our horses as the Indians had been burning it for severaldays.When the Hunters reached the bluffs they dividedinto two parties 10 in each and we travelled some 10 miles back andforth over the hills and saw no game except antelopes and wolves.I felt so unwell that I concluded to return tocamp and A Lyman and three others were with me. We sat down upon the edge of the Bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves whena company of horsemen approached in haste bearing a red flag. Whenthey got within a mile of us we trailed our arms and went downto meet them and were informed that the party who had gone up theriver had come upon an encampent of about 400 Indians warriorsand a party of about 100 had followed them down a ravine to cutof their retreat. We went into the camp.The horsemen had come to call in the Huntersand in their return they came across a herd of Buffalo and they 
 brought into camp three calves and 4 antelope.There was a good guard during the night kept andearly in the morning the cannon was fired twice to let the Indians know that wewere awake. I had a very severe night with my side.We started on our journey in the morning five ^waggons^ agons abreast making five roads. This was to be in readinessin case of an attack from Indians.We travelled 3 miles and saw some waggonson the opposite side of the river going down the Platte. Soon one ofthe men waded the river and came to see us to know who we were.He informed us they were traders from Fort Laramie that theywere 16 days from that place the grass good on the South sidebut burned up on the North side by the Indians. He would takeletters for us to Sarpee who lived near Winter Quarters; so thecamp stoped and wrote 52 letters to our families.I was ahead of the company with Orson Pratt taking observations and did not know of the matteruntil the time was nearly up and I then in great hast scribbleda few lines to my wife. An epistle was written to theChurch and three brethren accompanied the Frenchman acrossthe Platte to the other men of t his company who were 9 in allwho informed the brethren that they had not seen an Indiansince they left Laramie that there was a ferry at the fort &and agreed to take our letters safe.We drove on three miles farther andbailed our teams until the brethren returned from the Frenchtraders when they made a report to the camp of what was saidto them. A council of the whole company of Pioneers wasthen called to decide whether we should cross the Platt or continueup the North side.We were convinced that it would be betterfor us as a company to cross the river on to the old travellingroad to Laramie as there was good grass on that side 
 while the Indians were burning it all off on the North side of the river wherewe were travelling; but when we took into consideration the situation of the next companiesand the thousands who would follow after and as we were the Pioneers and hadnot our wives and children with us we thought it best to keep on the Northside of the River and brave the difficulties of burning prairies. Thusa road would be made that should stand as a permanent route for theSaints independant of the old emigration route and the River wouldseperate the emigrant companies that they need not quarrel for woodgrass or water and when our next company should come along thegrass would be much better than on the south side as it would growby that time.These were the views that the Pioneers assembledin a mass council took and the vote was called and it was unanimouslyresolved to go on the North side of the river. So the camp againmoved on; but during the moving Col. Markham drilled the menin a military capacity and they unshiped the cannon and carriedit on wheels.The Frenchman informed us that he never sawso many buffalo on the route before as this season and that they had tostop several times to let the herds pass. We saw many deerand antelope this day and a few buffalo and at night campednear a herd but a short distance from us. It was also afterwardsfound that the alarm of the 3rd about the 400 Indian warriors wasa false one and that a man had been frightened by a herd of antelopesupposing them in the distance to be Indians.The change from salt to fresh meat wasaffecting many in the camp.In the morning we had to keep a guard out toprevent a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle. Two bullsat noon were approaching our herd of cows and men had to go out anddrive them off. In the afternoon the brethren killed onecow and 5 calves and brought in a bull calf alive with the intentionsof raising it. It would try hard to bunt the men and dogs over 
 and some got hard raps. It was dead however the next day.We stoped for the night but found the grass onfire and had to return back one mile and camped on the bank of the river ona spot that was just burned over except small patches. Some took their horses on to an Island near by and cut down cottonwood for feed.We started early next morning without feeding(excepting a little corn) as there was no grass; travelled three miles and left it in our rear the fire and breakfasted on a good spot of grass.This morning the herds of buffalo speck bothsides of the river and the antelope was in great abundance some of whichwould run into the camp. A young buffalo calf also came in andfollowed us and we gave them some milk and left him.We continued our journey seeing many herds of buffalo & antelope and one large herd of Elk. Two antelopeswere killed this morning but as there was so much meat in campit was thought best not to kill many more game until we needed it.Dr Richards George A Smith and myself walked up quite near several herds of Buffalo and examined them through our glasses. They were shedding their coats. One bull had a massof wool swin[g]ing by his side like a loose robe.Our herd of cows started to run among the Buffalo but President Young galloped his horse to separate them and had great difficulty in doing so. He lost a spyglass in the chaseworth 40 dollars. The brethren hunted a long time for it but could not find it.We continued our journey among the herds of buffalo and were not out of sight of them at all and they had eaten the grass to such a degree that there was little remaining for our cattle and timber also we not but seldom met. We camped atnight near a heard of buffalo that reached as far as our eyes couldextent. This day the camp made 20 miles.Next day I should judge we saw ten thousand buffalo and came near one large herd with an unusual 
 number of calves yearlings and two years old. We saw several large ones mireddead wolves had commenced eating some. Wolves on every hand were seenfollowing the herd to eat those who died by wounds &c.President Young and others rode out in the evening afew miles to search out the road. There was some rain.The next morning was a pleasant morning and notso cold and windy as the day before. A start was not made until 10 o'clockas the teams needed rest and feed bad. I rode forward to day with the Twelveand others and the sights of buffalo that our eyes beheld was most astonishing.Thousands upon thousands would crowd together as they came from the bluffsto the bottom land to go to the river and sloughs to drink until the riverand land upon both sides of it looked as though the face of the earth wasalive and moving like the waves of the sea. Brother Kimball remarkedthat he had heard many buffalo tales told but never expected to beholdwhat his eyes now saw. The half had not been told him.When we stoped at noon many of thebuffalo walked along beside our waggons so that it would have beeneasy to shoot them down. O. P. Rockwell did shoot one throughthe neck and she droped dead. It was a two year old heffer and goodmeat. We had great difficulty in keeping our cattle and horsesfrom going among the herds and if they had got mixed it would havebeen almost impossible to have ever got them again.We travelled 11 1/4 miles this day until wecame to the bluffs that made down to the River and there we camped forthe night. Brother William Clayton had prepared a mile gage onthe hind wheel of his waggon so that the distance could be measured.Brigham Young H. C. Kimball GeorgeA Smith and myself went on to the highest bluffs near and took asurvey of the surrounding country without glasses; and the scenebefore us north east and west as far as our vision extended lookedas rough as the sea in a storm with the ridges and valleys mostlysand and scarcely any green thing upon it excepting a little scatteringgrass and the Spanish soap root which the Mexicans use for washing 
 The top resembles a pineapple & I brought in one root 24 inches long andtwo in diamater. I pounded a little of it and found that it would filla dish with suds like soap.On Sunday the 9th as we had no feed around us ourteams passed across the bluffs 4 miles and camped for the day. Iwrote two letters one to brother Ferguson and the other to Brother Bevinfor brother Wolsey ^Wolsey^ to take with him to Pueblo ^Pueblo^. We had ameeting and a good one. The Spirit of God ruled over the camp.Peace quietness and contentment pervaded almost every breast.The Twelve met and it was thoughtbest not for the brethren to start for Pueblo until they arrivedat Laramie. I rode with the Twelve and others 4 milesup the river and saw large herds of buffalo come to water.Monday morning was cool. Before leavingthe camp ground a letter was written to the next camp whichshould follow put into a small box nailed to a post 12 feetlong one end of which was planted firmly in the ground andstanding as a guide board with the following words inscribed:"Open this box and you will find a letter; 316 miles to WinterQuarters; Pioneers; Lattitude 41Â°. Our friends we hadno doubt would be glad to get the letter as it contained an accountof our journey.We travelled 6 miles and nooned and thentravelled 4 more and camped for the night. Our teams wasweek in consequence of there being no grass for severaldays. It being eaten all up. There was one buffaloâ€”onedeer and one hare brought into camp to day by the Hunterswhich was distributed among the company. We had whatfresh meat we wanted daily.The grass we found somewhat betterto day and we met but few buffalo but passed throughsome miles of dead grass which we burned to give newfeed to the next company. It made a great fire indeed 
 The Hunting Ground of the SiouxTwo days afterwards we found ourselves travellingover the hunting ground of the Sioux. Some 8 or ten days prior therehad been a large band there of from 500 to 1000. This we judged fromthe signs around us. They had taken the brains out of the largebuffalo their hides generally and some of the meat and had brokenup the bones for the marrow. One Hundred calves we founddead in one place with nothing taken but the tongues legs totheir knees and entrails. At another place 35 calves werefound dead and washed in heaps where the buffalo had been chasedacross the the river and had ran over the calves in rising the bankof the river.I found on the bluff their medicine bagtied to a stick 6 feet long struck up in the bank; also a saddletied to a large buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party whichway the buffalo had gone.I had left my horse to feed in the valleywhile I went on the Bluff to view the country and he started offnot seeing the camp took the back track and I had to run afterhim and in doing this I ran through the great encampment ofthe Sioux where their lodges had been on their hunting expedition.Here I left my gun and followed my horse until I overtookhim & with the assistance of brother Fowler who came out of theencampment I stoped him and rode back got my gun andexamined the ground and judged that there had been five hundredlodges. There were acres of ground covered with buffalowool where they had dressed their skins buffalo wolf &cI brought in a good dressed white wolf skin.Many of the brethren went out the nextday to visit the Indian encampment and brought in partsof robes leather &c which had been left. 
 We travelled to day eleven miles. The bluffsfor the first time on the North Fork came bald to the river so thatwe had to go over the bluffs with our waggons.There is one thing concerning the Platt Riverworthy of note. It is much of the way a mile in width generallycovered with water but very shallow. When the south wind blowshard the water all rushes to the north shore so that one wouldsuppose there was a great rise in the tide but let the wind shiftand blow hard from the north and the water immediatelyrecedes from the north shore until one can walk across twothirds of the River on bare ground. Thus the River constantlyebbs and flows like the tide according to the wind.Early next morning I went out to huntBuffalo returned to breakfast and started out agian with PhineasYoung. I got lost among the Bluffs but found my way outagain. Brother Phineas shot a buck antelope and I carriedhim into camp. There were three antelopes and one buffalokilled.Some of the hunters thought they heard Indianguns during the night on the opposite side of the river. AnIndian cralled up to a pair of mules that were tied together andmade a grab at them but the mules sprang and got awayOne of the gards shot at him and he ran. All the horseswere then brought into the circle of our camp and the cannonprepared for firing but seeing no one it was not fired.A large number of barefoot trackswere seen next morning supposed to be of the Indians who camedown last night to steal our horses. We travelled eightmiles during the day: in the morning our road was over theBluffs with cold North wind and rain but we had the best grasswe had found on the road. We camped on the prairie. Iwent out with some others to hunt got within about 30 rodsof the Buffalo and shot at the neck of one. The ball entered 
 his shoulder and crippled him but he hobbled away with the herd. There were a numberof hunters among the herds and one of them killed a fat buffalo which wasbrought into camp.Sunday the 16th was still cloudy and a cold wind. WithBrothers Young Kimball Benson Rockwell and Stephens I rode 4 milesover the Bluffs to pick out a road for the Pioneers to get again on thebottom land. We had a good meeting in the afternoon; and thelaws of the camp were read. One of the brethren had shot anantelope and a buffalo which was against the rules of the campto go hunting on the Sabbath.Monday was warm and pleasant but our roadwas hard: two and a half miles through land bluffs when we againstruck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our last camping place.The hunters brought in 3 buffalo which detained the camp sometimeto get and President Young was not pleased with it as we hadso much meat in camp. We saw large droves of deer in thebottoms more than we had seen before. A young fawn was pickedup and brought into camp. I led the company of Pioneersmostly through the bluffs in the morning before brothers Youngand Kimball came up when we rode together all daypicking out the road.The camp was called together next dayand President Young sharply reproved the hunters for shootingso much meat detaining the camp and for taking more lifethan necessary and also the horsemen for their indifference inpicking out the road. He said there were but two who hadmanifested any interest in helping him get the camp alongAfterwards the horsemen went forward to pick out the road insteadof going hunting and I did not hear a gun fired during the day.The following day we met the worstsand hill on the journey and what made it worse was that therain was pouring down upon us continually; and we had more rainduring the day and evening than ever before on our route. I rode 
 forward during the day in the rain picking out the road. We travelledeight miles.Next morning seven miles were made andwe moved opposite Ash Creek on the South side of the river wherethe Origon raod first strikes the North fork of the Platt. Severalof the brethren went over in the boat which we were taking alongto examine the rocky bluffs road creek &c.In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 milesand camped for the night. We had a very good road most of the dayon the bank of the river. There was a good bit of rock bluff onboth sides of the river and some on the South side was formed intonatural terraces rotundas squares &c from 50 to a hundred feethigh and looked like good foundations for forts fortifications and strongholds. They resemble the works of art and look something likethe old castles of England and Scotland. They were level on thetop. There is a beautiful Cedar Island in the river ashort distance above Ash Creek which is a good landmark toshow travellers where the Oregon road strikes the river.Before we left the encampment nextmorning Bro Clayton put up a guide board for the benefit ofthe next company bearing the inscription, "From Winter Quarters409 miles; from the Junction 93 1/4 Cedar Bluff 36 1/2Ash Hollow 8 miles and 133 from Fort Laramie."We travelled 7 1/2 miles and nooned andeight more and camped for the night. I killed a bagger withthe jaw bone of a buffalo.Just as we got to our camping place twoIndians came from the Bluffs riding towards us and made signs forus to come to them. Several of the brethren went. It wasa Sioux Indian and his squaw. They talked by signs andwent away.Our road was very straight on the morrow'stravel but we came over 2 1/2 miles of the worst sand hill that we 
 had passed. The bluffs on our route today presented the most singular naturalscenery I had ever beheld in all my travels. It had the appearance of theold walls and ruins of the castles of Europe. The brethren found a part ofa petrified leg bone of a mammoth. It was from the knee joint downwardswas 17 inches long and 11 wide and weighed 27 lbs.Next day was Sunday the 23rd. In companywith Brigham Young and the Twelve I visited the top of the highest bluffruins that lie opposite our encampment which was truly a curiosity. Wehad a fair view of Chimney Rock from where we were. I carried a bleachedBuffalo's head on the top and we wrote upon it our names and distancefrom several places. O. Pratt took a Barometrical observation onthe solitary cedar tree on the top of the bluff ruins.The camp met at half past eleven in themorning for Sabbath services. Erastus Snow addressed the meetingfollowed by President Young who said he was satisfied that theLord was with us and leading us. He had never seen a companyof people more united than the camp had been thus far on the journey;that we should pluck the fruit of this mission to all eternity; thathe had many things to teach us but could not do it only in a stakeof Zion; but he was well satisfied with himself his brethren the Twelveand the camp at large. One thing he would say to the praise ofall and that was that not one had refused to obey his council on theroad. His peace with God was continually like a river and he feltthat the fruit of peace rested upon the whole camp.Several others spoke and the meeting was thendismissed.We intended to have rode out in the evening butsaw that a storm was gathering. It began to blow very hard andit was as much as we could do to save our waggon bows and coversfrom being smashed. It continued for about an hour and thenrained for another hour accompanied by hail. I covered all my horseswith all the blankets I could get and got up several times in the nightto see them. It rained occasionaly and the horses shook with cold but 
 morning came and all was alive again and we continued our journeyAs soon as we camped at noon two Indianscame to the camp. They were Sioux and well dressed and clean. Wegave them dinner and they left.We camped at night near the quicksandmountain making 16 1/2 miles that day. I rode about twomiles forward to find grass and a camping ground and on myreturn saw about 30 Sioux plunge their horses into the river onthe opposite side and make towards us. I rode with severalothers to the river and met them as they came out. They shookhands with us very friendly. The chief unfurled a large Americanflag with the Eagle stars and stripes and presented me a letter,written in French which we however made out. They were allwell dressed and the chief was in a military coat. The brethrenbrought a white flag and planted it by the side of theirs. They wanted to go into camp. We proposedfor five of them to go and the rest to remain but they all wantedto go so we let them and gave them supper. They remained in camp allnight but were good and stole nothing.Some little trading was done with theSioux next morning and we gave them breakfast. They behaved well andwhen we started crossed the river. I had to keep my carriage todayhaving the rheumatism in shoulders & back and teeth ache.We nooned next day in good grass 2 milesabove Chimney Rock and I rode to day with brothers Kimball andBenson to look out the road. By an imperfect measurement by atrigonometrical observation by the sextant Professor Pratt madeChimney Rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river.A Panic Among our TeamsJust before camping at noon while travelling ona smooth Prairie an Indian horse that was bought of the Siouxran away with a singletree at his heals and gave a tremendous 
 fright to the cows oxen and horses and in an instant a dozen or more waggonswere darting by each other like lightning and the horses and mules flying asit were over the ground some turning to the right and some to the left andsome ran into other waggons. The horses and mules that brother Fowlerwas driving leaped with all speed with he holding the bits and brother Littlethe lines darted by my carriage like electricity and came within one inchof a collision with my wheels which would have made a wreck. Anotherwaggon with a pair of mules and one yoke of cattle dashed by which wouldalso have smashed my carriage had they looked. By this time myown horses started to run but was held by the driver. Fowlers waggoncontinued regardless of rough or smooth ground about 50 rods be ^being^ dragedthe whole distance by the bit which was the case with many othersbut all were soon stoped and returned to their lines without accidentwhich appeared truly a miracle. A person can hardly conceive thepower manifested by anamals especially mules in such a frightand it gave us some idea what an Indian yell would do in a campwith teams hitched to waggons.Brother Kimball and myself picked the roadduring our journey of the following morning ^morning^ and in the afternoon I pilotedas straight as any road yet made on the whole route and picked out a campingground on the bank of the river in good feed.It showed he understood that we were pioneeringa road for the whole House of Israel to travel in for many a yearto come and therefore that it required the greatest care in markingthe route.A cold rainy morning followed and weconcluded not to start until it stoped so we remained till 10 o'clockand travelled 11 1/2 miles and camped for the night.During the evening President Young calledat my fire and seeing several brethren playing dominoes in a waggonnear by he began to teach saying that the Devil was getting powerover the camp which had for several days given way to cardsdominoes &c and that if they did not spedily repent their works 
 labours and journey would be in vain. He said that to be sure the campdidin't quarrel for the Devil would not set them at that as long as hecould draw them gradually away from duty and fill them withnonsense and folly for the Devil was very cunning in winning awaythe people of God. I felt the force of his remarks.During the evening I went into Dr Richard'swaggon and read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and prayed withthem after which President Young H. C. Kimball Willard RichardsE. T. Benson and Wilford Woodruff met in council in brother Brigham'swaggon and President Young wrote some of the word of the Lordconcerning the camp and expressed his views and feelings; thatthey must spedily repent or they would be cursed that they wereforgetting their mission and that he would rather travel with tenrighteous men who would keep the commandments of God thanthe whole camp while in a carless manner and forgettingGod. We stayed together till ten o'clockThe Pioneers ChastisedNext morning President Young called the camptogether and required each captain seperately to call out his men and whenall were present except two who had gone out hunting he addressedthem something near in the following words:"I think I will take as my text topreach my sermon fromâ€”I am about to revolt from travellingwith this camp any farther with the Spirit they now possess."I had rather risk myself among the savageswith ten men who are men of faithâ€”men of mighty prayerâ€”men ofGod than to be with this whole camp when they forget God andturn their hearts to folly and wickedness yea I would rather bealone and I am now resolved not to go any father with thecamp unless you will covenant to humble yourselves beforethe Lord and serve Him and cease your folly and wickedness 
 For a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing and checkers anddominoes have occupied the attention of the brethren and dancing and nigeringand hooing down all has been the test continually.Now it is time to quit it. There has beentrials and lawsuits upon every nonsensical thing and if this is suffered togo on it will not be but a short time before you are fighting ^knocking^ mowing eachother down and taking life. It is high time it was stoped.I do not want to hear anymore such reports as I heard last Sunday of men going to meeting and preaching to therest after playing cards until meeting time. You are a pretty set ofmen going to look out a location among the mountains for a restingplace for the Saints even the whole Church of God who have beendriven out from the Gentiles and rejected of them. And after youhave established a location you are then going out to preach theGospel and seal salvation upon the House of Israel and gather the nations.How would you look if they should know your conduct and ask you what you did when you went to seek outZion and find a resting place for the Saints where the standard ofthe Kingdom of God could be reared and her banners unfurled forfor the nations to gather unto?"Did you spend a good deal of your timein dancing pitching quoit jumping wrestling and the like? Yes, yes.Did you play cards dice checkers dominoes? O! Yes.What ycould you do with yourselves?Why you would think from the glance of the eyes of God angels andmen even wicked men. Then are you not ashamed of yourselvesfor practising these things? Yes you are, and you must quitit."After speaking somewhat lengthy upon thesematters President Young called Twelve together and the HighPriests Seventies and Elders and there was found to be eight ofthe quorum of the Twelve 18 High Priests 80 Seventies andeight Elders. 
 After this was done President Young said unto theTwelveâ€”"I[f] you are willing to humble yourselves before the Lordand covenant to do right and walk humbly before Him makeit manifest by raising the right hand."Then each one raised his hand andthe same question was put to the High Priests Seventies Elders andMembers and all universally covenentted with uplifted hands tohumble themselves before the Lord repent of their sins and keepHis commandments.President Young then spoke of those whowere not in the Church as there was some present. They wouldbe protected in their rights but they must not introduce wickednessinto the camp for it would not be suffered. He also spokeof the standard and ensign that would be reared in Zion.Elder Kimball followed and said thatthe words of President Young was as the word of the Lord untohim and just as binding us though it was a written revelationand it was just as binding upon the whole camp as it wasupon him and he urged the Pioneers to give heed to the teachingsthat had been given.O Pratt remarked that if the Saints hadleasure hours they could spend them at much better advantage then inplaying cards as there was a world of knowledge and science to beobtained and every moment should be improved in storing the mindwith some good principle. And he acknowledged the teachings we had received to be of the Lord.Wilford Woodruff said: "A burnedchild dreaded the fire. He had not forgotten his journey inthe camp of Zion in 1834 and should he live to the age ofMethusalah he should not forget the hour when the Prophet andSeer Joseph Smith stood upon the waggon wheel and addressedthat camp and said that because they had not hearkened unto 
 unto his counsel but disobeyed and transgressed from time to time judgement mustcome and that we should be visited by the Destroying Angels. And so wewere and more than twenty of our members fell by the stroke and weall suffered much in our feelings. I pray the Lord I may not see anothersuch a time; and I would now advise my brethren to be careful inkeeping the counsel ^covenant^ we have made lest by and by the word of the Lord cameunto us as in the days of Joseph and we cannot escape His judgement.I would advise all the brethren who have got cards and the like to fromthem for if you keep the covenants you have made you will have notime to use them and if you keep them for your children they will onlyprove a curse to them. My prayer to God is that we may all beenabled to keep our covenants with the Lord and each other. I rejoicethat the watchman in our midst are quick to comprehend and warn ofevil and reprove us when wrong that we may be saved and do thewill of God.Brother George A Smith and myself wenttogether to pilot out the road. We travelled 8 1/2 miles and camped for the night in good feed.Day of Prayer and FastingSunday 30thWe set this Sabbath apart for prayer and fasting.In the morning I shaved cleansed my body put on cleanclothing & read a chapter in the Book of Mormon humbled myselfbefore the Lord and poured out my soul in prayer before ^Him^ the Lordand His Spirit descended upon me and I was blessed and prepared forthe service of the day and then I spent some time in writingin my Journal.The camp had a prayer meeting in themorning and met again for public meeting. PresidentYoung with the Quorum of the Twelve and a few others wentinto the valley of the hills and prayed according to the order of the 
 Priesthood. Porter and Brother Carrington watched to see that no Indianscame upon us. We had a good time. There was a heavy showerstorm appeared but it mostly went around and there was but littlerain where we were.We returned to our waggons took somerefreshment having eaten nothing all day and soon the sun cameout pleasantly and in the evening I went out two miles with thequorum of the Twelve into a high bluff and we had a good viewof the Black Hills and also engaged in prayers.Two days afterwards we campedopposite Fort Laramie. This was June the 1st.When we arrived we saw some menapproaching us from the Fort and found them to be a part of thecompany of Missisippi brethren who had been to Pueblo throughthe Winter. Brother Crow and his family 7 waggons and14 souls were the persons who were at Fort Laramie. Heinformed us that the remainder of the Missisippi company withthe portion of the Mormon Battalion at Pueblo would start from Laramieabout the 1st of June and follow our trail; told us of 4 of the brethrenwho had died and had heard nothing of the main body of theBattalion.President Young suggested the propriety ofof our leaving all our ploughs at the Fort except such as we need touse immediately when we got to our destination and also to doour blacksmithing mending waggons &c as soon as possible so that wemight go on our journey speedily. A company company was appointedto attend to the herding and these branches of business.June the 2nd in company with the Twelveand others I crossed the river to visit the Fort. We examinedFort St John which was now evacuated but the walls were still standingThe dimensions of Fort St John were 144 by 132 outside and inside contained16 rooms. The largest on the North side was 98 feet long 47 wideThe Oregon trail ran one rod from S. W. corner of the fort. 
 We next visited Fort Laramie then occupied by 38 personsmostly French who have married the Sioux. Mr Burdow was the superintendant.This fort was 168 by 116 outside with 6 rooms inside. It was quite a pleasantsituation for a fort.Mr Burdow was a Frenchman. He received us kindlyand invited us into a large setting room and gave us all the informationhe could in relation to our route and furnished us with his flat bottom boaton reasonable terms to assist us in ferrying the Platte. He informed usthat Gov. Boggs and his men had much to say against the Mormons andcautioned him to take care of his horses and cattle &c lest we shouldsteal them and tried to prejudice him all he could against us. Burdowsaid that Boggs company was quarreling all the time and most of his themhad deserted him. He finally told Boggs and company that let the Mormonsbe what they might they could not be worse than he and his men.After conversing with Mr Burdow a length oftime we got into the flat bottom boat about 20 of us and went down theLaramie Fork to its mouth about 2 miles and up the Platte 1/2 a mileto our camp. After dinner we met in council and decided thatAmasa Lyman should go to Pueblo with several other brethren tomeet the detachment of the Battalion that was there and for themto come as soon as convenient to Laramie and follow our trail.A very windy day followed but we commencedbefore sunrise to ferry over our boats. My ten was the first that wentover.We set up our blacksmiths shops in the old fortto do our work and made fires to do our washing.In the evening the Twelve and others went on tothe highest peak to view the surrounding country and on our returnwe visited the Indian and French burying ground. The Indians werelaid upon a staging about 10 feet from the ground but the Frenchburied in the ground with crosses at their head being Catholicsand strong pickets around their burying place.I wrote letters to Mrs Woodruff my father 
 A. O. Smoot and J. Benbow and left them in the hands of Mr [blank] whokept the store and acted as Post Master. He said he would forward our lettersfor Winter Quarters to the care of Mr SarpeeBefore we left the fort Bro Clayton erecteda guide board on the North side for the next company.We started on our journey again on the 4thand the route began to be attended with considerable interest of scenery aswe commenced the assent into the Black Hills.Brother Robert Crow had joined us whichadded to our company 9 men 5 women 3 children 6 waggons 13yoke of oxen 20 cows 3 bulls ten young cattle and horses whichmade our whole camp now 148 men 8 women 5 children79 waggons 96 horses 51 mules 90 yoke of oxen 43 cows 3 bulls9 calves 16 dogs and 16 chickens.As we travelled father into the hills theygrew lofty and we began to come into an Elk bear and mountain sheepcountry. Soon after we arrived at the Springs 15 miles fromLaramie the first company of Missouri emigrants came up 12 waggonsof them. We journeyed 10 1/2 miles farther in the afternoon and the Missouricompany camped a 1/4 of a mile below us.Next day was Sunday the 6th which we devotedto prayer and fasting but the Missouri company of emigrants started onin the morning.The camp met for prayer meeting at 8 o'clockand the Spirit of the Lord was with the people and met again forpreaching at 11 o'clock. We had a shower of rain and the meetingclosed. Another company of Missouri wagons 20 in numberpassed us. The rain soon cleared off and our company movedforward five miles and camped for the night on Bitter Creek.The two Missouri companies which hadcamped near us at night started before us in the morning and whilemoving another company of 13 waggons passed us. We were in a fair view of Laramie Peak with its snow covered top. We camped 
 for the night on the Horse Shoe Creek in the best feed we had met on our journey. Thehunters brought in two black tailed deer and one antelope.Next day we formed a company of men and went forwardof comf our teams and cleared the road of stone. We used pick axes bars spades &cand it was a great help to our weak wgaggons.In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles over the most mountaneous road on our way and then descended into the Valley andcamped for the night on Labent Creek with an abudance of timber waterand good grass.Brother John Higby went forward hunting and sawthe Missouri companies of emigrants and when they started out theyhad such strife one with another in trying to start first. They did notstop to milk their cows and in clearning up their breakfast they strewed theirmeal salt bacon short cake beans and other things upon the groundthroughout their encampment and when we came up 3 wolves were feedingupon the fragments.In coming over the hills today we found itso cold it pierced us like Winter. On reaching the Valley we foundfires the companies in advance had built and we pilled on the woodand soon got warm. An antelope lay before us which the huntershad brought in. We carved it up with our knives forked it onsticks roasted it and satisfied ourselves finely without the seasoningof salt.We started in the morning at 5 o'clockinto better feed a mile further on and turned out our teams. Thebrethren did some trading with the hunters who camped near us.At 7 o'clock 15 of our waggons was formedinto a company to go forward to make a boat to ferry the Platte.They went forward and we followed them and the traders started at the same time.Soon another party of traders overtook uswho were direct from Santa Fee. They informed us that the MormonBattalion was at California went in Jan and that Capt. Brown was 
 in Santa Fee for money for the detachment and would come on us soon as possible.In the afternoon of the next day Presidents Youngand Kimball rode with us. Our detached company had not been heardof since last night when they camped with the foremost company. Wecamped this night at Deer Creek had good feed and our horses and cattlewere gaining daily.Ch. 28I examined a splendid grinding stone quaryon the East side of the road as it leaves the hills and strikes the Platte andBrother Carrington found a very excellent coal bed on Deer Creek. Thespecimens produced were good.At the blowing of the horn at night I didnot feel much like retiring to bed so I walked half a milefrom the camp on the bank of Deer Creek and found brotherWilliam Clayton fishing with a hook. He had caught twodozen good fish they resembled the eastern herring. Another brotherhad also caught some. As they were about to leave they lefttheir lines for me to fish with.So I sat down for half an hour musingalone as unconcered as though I had been on the banks ofFarmington River in my native place when suddenly I hearda rustling in the bushes near me and for the first time the thoughtflushed across me that I was in a country abounding with thegrizly Bear wolves and Indians and was liable to an attack atany moment from either of them away from my company andno weapon to defend myself against even a Badger. I thought itwisdom to return to camp and picking up my fishing rods I walkedleasurely home and retired to rest.Next day we rode our horses during ourjourney several times into the river to find a fording place butcould not. Our detached company was reported at the ferryten miles or so above us. Our hunters brought in 13 antelopesand the Msisssourian Company killed 3 Buffalo.I started on the following morning 
 to go forward in company with brother A. P. Rockwood who was riding President [Brigham Young|Young'ssteed when suddenly he sprang upon my horse but instead of striking him he tookmy knee into his jaw and brused me considerably sinking one tooth to the bonethrough three thickness of clothing and one of them buckskin.George A Smith and myself then rode on to theFerrying place and found our detachment ferrying over the Missourian companywho paid the brethren $1.50 cts for each waggon and load and paid in flourat $2.50 cts per cwt. while flour through this country was worth at least10 dollars per cwt.It was very difficult to get over the river. Theycarried the goods over in a boat but drew the waggons over the ropes byhand but when the current struck them they would frequently roll overseveral times in the water and they came near drowning their horses. Oneof the men would have been lost had not the brethren picked him upwith the boat. On the road the Missouri company had a run away ^stampede^of their teams turning over their waggons brusing women and children andsmashing their things and one ran into the river and would probably havedrowned and lost all had not a little boy jumped out beside the offox which frightened him and he "hawed off" and ran on to a sand bankdragging the others with him. The boy was knocked over into thewater and hurt but the scene ended without any loss of life.Our blacksmiths had been to work for theMissouri company for which they got flour money &c and ourhunters had been busily engaged. They had killed 5 fatbuffalo one old she bear and 3 cubs and shot at 2 grizly bear butdid not get them. Those killed were black bear. Our huntersalso brought into camp 8 antelope.Sunday was a very warm day and the campmet for prayer meeting at 9 o'clock and at 10 we had a preachingmeeting. President Kimball first addressed the meeting andwas followed by President Young who remarked upon the greatdifference between us as a camp and the Missourian companieswho were travelling the same road. He said, "They curse swear 
 rip and tare and are trying to swallow up the earth but though they do notwish us to have a place on it the Earth will soon open and swallow themup and they will go to the land of forgetfulness while the Saints iffaithful though they suffer some privations here will ultimately inheritthe earth and increase in power dominion and glory."He spake much to our edification and was followedby Elder O Pratt and afterwards the meeting dismissed and the Twelvecolonels captains &c of the camp met at President Young's waggon andconsulted upon the measures to be adopted to get across the river. Itwas finally agereed to go immediately to the mountains with waggonsand teams and for every two Tens to get polls and lash two or fourwaggons abreast to keep them from turning over and float themacross the river with boats and ropes. So a company of horsemenstarted for the mountains and teams to draw the poles.In the evening the flour meal and baconwere distributed through the camp equally which had been earned fromthe Missouri company for ferrying them over. It amounted to 5 1/2 lbsof flour 2 lbs of meal and a small piece of bacon for each individualin the camp. It looked as much of a miracle to me to see our flourand meal bags replenished in the midst of the Black Hills as it didto have the children of Israel fed with manna in the Wilderness. Butthe Lord has been truly with us on our journey and wonderfully preservedand blessed us.At daylight next morning the two first twoTens were called together to make arrangements for crossing. Some ofour party did not like the mode proprosed to lash the waggons togetheras the current was so strong so we appointed brother Grover as ourCaptain to direct the rafting and concluded to put our poles into a raftand carry our goods over in a boat and ford our waggons on the raft.We commenced at 5 o'clock in the morning and in four hours we had landed eleven waggon loads of goods upon theNorth Shore with our little leather boat and during the day we got over all the waggons belonging to our Tens being eleven waggons in all 
 The rest of the encampment being twelve Tens only gotover the same number of waggons as ourselves. They floated their waggons bytying from two to four together but the waggons turned clean over each otherbottom side up and back again breaking the bows covers and boxes to piecesand loasing ploughs axes and iron left in the boxes.Most of our company was in the water frommorning till night and all was very weary when the work was done.Just has we had drawn Dr. Richards' two waggonsto the shore and loaded his goods into them when a storm struck us. I spranginto my carriage tied all down tight and laid out my whole strength inholding my waggon cover on but the rain wind and hail beat soheavily that it was a task and my bed and things were nearly drenchedIt only lasted seven minutes but was severe on our waggons and goodsand our horses ran two or three miles in the storm. I crossed theriver went after them tied them up and returned weary but had somepleasant dreams at night.I felt unwell next day from the exposures of yesterday and with the teeth ache with which I had suffered muchon my pioneer journey. It was very windy to day and our companiescrossed the river very slowly. Another Missouri company hadcome up with us.President Young thought it wisdom to leavea number of the brethren here with ^until^ our companies deigning to follow uscome up and for them to keep a Ferry for the emigrants on the roadnot of our people who would pay $1.50 cts per waggon in flour at$2.00 cts per cwt and cows at $10.The brethren made two new rafts on thethird day of our fording the river and got quite a number of ourPioneer waggons over. I was still unwell but in company withOrson Pratt I went on to some of the Bluffs to view the countryand shot one antelope. This was the first antelope I ever killed.We had some heavy squals of wind and rainand in the evening many of us went over the river and tied up our horses 
 and when one company was returning in the leather boat it half filled and theycame nearly sinking.Early on the following morning we swam ourhorses over and one mule was nearly drowned by being tangled in a rope butthe current carried him ashore.Twenty men the day before went down theriver to dig out two large canoes to cover over and make a Ferry boat.The emigrants were arriving daily at our Fording place and they reportedone thousand waggons between there and Laramie. This was the5 6th day spent in ferrying our Pioneer company across the river but nowwe had succeeded in getting all over and once more formed our waggonsinto a circle. Over brethren crossed some of the Missourians also andran their boat all night in ferrying them.Next day also we were still ferrying the Gentiles and another large company arrived. We gathered our cattle at10 o'clock and harnessed but did not start as all were not ready to we turned out our teams againIn the afternoon we heald a council andresolved to leave 9 men to tend the Ferry to ford emigrant compaiesand also our own brethren who should come after us. The men werechosen and we met with them again in the evening. President Youngrebuked one who hepettioned to stay but whom he wished to continue onwith us. He also instructed the brethren who were to tarry to keeptogether and divide their means accumulated equally according to theirlabour for each to esteem his brother as himself in no wise to retain that which belonged to the traveller to be careful of the livesand property of those they ferried to forget not their prayers and to comeup after us with the next company of Saints.The brethren to remain at the Ferry wereThomas Grover, captain; John S. Higby Luke Johnson William EmpyEdmund Elsworth Benjamin F. Stewart Francis Pomeroy JamesDavenport and Appleton HarmonAfter 7 days tarry we continued our 
 journey travelled during the day 21 1/2 miles and had the most wretched camping groundat night we had found on the way. President Young thought it might be properly calledhell-gate.  The country abounded with alkaline and the water was disgustinglynaucious. Our horses and cattle being thirstly drank some and left it and someof the cattle got badly mired in the marshes. Our hunters brought in onebuffalo 1 deer and 3 antelope.Early on the Sunday morning we hitched up withoutfeed or water and left our encampment of death poison-waters and alkalinemarshes and drove 3 miles to a good campground and sweet water. This wason the Willow Spring branch about 3  miles from the head.We bated 2 hours and took breakfast andPresident Young wished me to go on about 15 miles and look up a campground for the night. So I went forward and George A Smith withme to the head of the Willow Spring. Here he stoped with a doctorof a Missourian company who had been attending a sick family towait for our waggons to come up and I rode on aloneAfter travelling alone several miles brother John Brown came up with me and we rode on together over a sandy barren sagecountry to a creek of good water about 10 miles west of the Willow SpringsWe arrived here at half past 1 o'clock, and turned out our horses to bait.Here we tarried till four o'clock watching forour waggons to come in sight but we could see no waggons. At lengthtwo horsemen were seen approaching and we waved a small flag forthem to come to us supposing they were of our company but they turnedout to be two hunters of the Missouri companies carrying in buffalomeat to their camp. In the distance they thought we were Indiansand made off.I mounted my horse and put after them andsoon overtook them and made inquiries concerning our company. Theysaid they had not seen it but had seen about a dozen waggonscoming by themselves.I then concluded that our camp had stopedat the Willow Springs and so Captain Smith one of the hunters and who was the leader 
 of the Missouri ^Co^ invited us to go on and camp with them for the night as they did notexpect to go more than a few miles further than the Creek we were nowon. We could see five miles on the road back and no waggonswere in sight and as it was now five o'clock I concluded our companywould not come on and if they did they would go no farther thanthe Creek.We accepted Captain Smith's proposal andwent on with him to spend the night with his camp but instead ofjournying only a mile or so he continued on mile after mile findingneither feed nor water excepting salt and alkaline grounds until we struckthe Sweet Water river at Independence Rock so noted already in Fremont'sJournal and by other travellers. This was 12 miles from the Creekbefore spoken of.The Sweet Waters were sweet indeed bothto man and beast after travelling thorough so much alkiline countryand there was good feed around.After a good supper of bacon buffalo cornbread coffee milk &c I laid down in a tent with the Missourians butdid not rest well. I found there was a great difference betweenthese Missouri emigrant companies and our own where there wasno such thing as cursing swearing quarrelling contending withother companies &c allowed or practised.But to return to our Pioneer company. Ata late hour they came up to the Creek which we had left 12 milesback and grass being poor continued on 4 miles West of the creekand camped for the night. Not finding me at the creek nor hearingfrom me at all they felt somewhat alarmed lest I was lost or had gotinto trouble with the Indians. They blew the bugle and watchedfor me till midnight and finally fired the cannon while I wascamped 10 miles from them not thinking that I was giving themany trouble. I travelled this day a distance of thirty milesand our Pioneer company 20 miles. 
 Independance RockReached by the PioneersJune 21 1847I arose early this morning took breakfast and in company withBrother Brown rode clear round Independance Rock. We examined the manynames and lists of names of the trappers traders travellers and emigrants nearbyall in black red and yellow paint on this rock. Some had washed out anddefaced. The greatest number was put on within a few years but wefound some of thirty years standing. Nearly all the companies whopass put their names on. this rockAfter going around and examining it westaked our horses and mounted it. I went forward and gained thehighest point of the south and of the Rock which contains the names. Ithen went to the North end which is the highest point of IndependanceRock. Here is an opening or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 personsand a rock standing upon the highest peak of about 3 tons weightUpon this rock at the highest point we climbedand offered up our prayers according to the order of the Priesthood prayingearnestly for the blessing of God to rest on President Young and hisbrethren the Twelve and all the Pioneer camp, the whole camp andHouse of Israel in the wilderness our wives children and relatives, the Mormon Battelion and the Churches abroad. While offering up ourprayers the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us.I was the First Latter-day Saint on Independance RockWe had a view of our camp from the Rock andexpected they would noon there so we mounted our horses andconcluded to examine the country around. We rode fivemiles to the North East went on to the top of a high bluff and 
 saw our camp in motion. We than rode to the foot of the mountainand traced the way to theDevil's Gatethrough which the Sweet Water runs. Here we spent but a fewmoments and then hurried back to Indipendence Rock. As our camphad come up before we could get to them and camped half a mile Eastof the Rock it.I met President Young going up to IndependenceRock and I related to him my travels since I left the company. Heasked me to go back with him so I turned out my horse having rodehim twenty miles during the forenoon and returned with President YoungWillard Richards George A Smith and others. We spent halfan hour on the Rock and then returned to our camp mounted our horsesand rode to the Devil's Gate, five miles from IndipendenceRockWe rode as far as we could into the Gatehitched our horses and walked into about the centre of the cavernThe Devils Gate is 400 feet high, perpendicularrocks, 120 feet wide and 50 rods long and the water rushes throughit with a roar. The rocks are course grey granite with a vein ofblack trap rock running through. We spent about half an hour hereand then had to back our horses out and rode around it on theSouth Side. Some of the footmen walked over the top of it. Wecamped for the night about one mile west of the Devil's Gate on thebank of the Sweet Water.A Guide Board was put up at Devils Gatestating that it was 175 1/4 miles from Fort Laramie and 50 1/4 fromour Ferry of the Platte River.Two more Missourian companies overtookus at noon on our next day's travel and they informed us that aman was drowned at the Ferry after we left in trying to swim his 
 horses and they had not found his body.The camp started on again after our company had noonedbut brothers Young Little Benson and myself went back to meet Lorenzo Youngwho had broken an abxletree of his waggon and we were behind all theafternoon.After a journey of 20 3/4 miles the Pioneers campedat night at the foot of a mound about 200 feet high on the bank of Sweet WaterBrother Kimball and myself went to the top of it and looked down upon the campand it appeared to us delightful. We offered up our prayers and the Srpitritof the Lord rested up us and then we decended to the camp. The moonwas shining beautifully. On the 24th the best horse in camp President Young's was shot by accident.The South Pass ReachedJune the 26On the evening of the 26 after a travel of 18 3/4 miles we campedopposite the table rock and near the summit of the South Pass. Iwas quite astonished at the road and country to day considering wewere crossing the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains it was the bestroad we had travelled over for many days and had it not been forthe wide river ^Wind River^ range of mountains in full view of our right covered witheternal snow and some snow banks 10 feet deep by the side of theroad as we passed along with the table rock on the left I should almosthave thought myself travelling over the beautiful prairies of Illinois andMissouri excepting that the country was covered with more sage thanprairie grass. The road for many miles and also the plainof beautiful grass lying North of the table rock were strewn withvery handsome cornelian stones. I saw more in one hour this eveningthan ever before during my whole ^life travels^ either in the rude state or polishedand set in breast pins &c in all the jewellers shops I ever saw in mytravelsElders Kimball, Pratt, G. A Smith & Brownhad gone to take observations on the dividing ridge and they 
 continued on to the Green River 7 miles from us which runs into the Pacificwhile we were on the Sweet Waters that run into the Altantic. Theysupposed that we should come on to them and as they did not returnseveral of us mounted our horses to go in search of them but we soonmet brother Kimball returning and he informed us that the rest ofbrethren would camp on the Green River with some men from Oregon on their way to the StatesJune the 27 1847 was the day 3 years fromthe martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum SmithIt was Sunday morning but we harnessedup our teams and drove to where brothers Pratt and Smith had campedwith Major Harris who had been travelling through Oregon and Californiafor 25 years and had much acquaintance with the Country. He broughta file of Oregon papers and one published by S. Brannon ofCalifornia. We had much conversation with him andhe spoke unfavourably of the Salt Lake Country for a settlement.but spoke of other places not far off that were goodMeeting with Mr. BridgerWe parted with Major Harris next day after doing sometrading with him and in our afternoon's travel met Mr Bridger ofthe fort on the way with two men going to Fort Laramie. Hewas expecting us and wished to have an interview with President Youngand the Twelve and we also wished to have an interview with him so we immediately returned to the Creek upon which we hadnooned and camped for the night and Mr. Bridger and his mencamped with us.We met in council with Mr Bridger andspent some hours in conversation and found him to have been a greattraveller and had ^professed^ an extensive knowledge of nearly all Oregon andCaliforniaâ€”the mountains lakes rivers springs valleys mines ore &cHe spoke more highly of the Great Basin for a settlement than 
 Major Harris had done said that it was his paradise and that if this peoplesettled in it he wanted to settle with them. He said that there was but one thingthat could operate against its becoming a great grain country and that wouldbe frost for he did not know but the frost might affect the corn. He conversedwith us about a great variety of subjects connected with the country said he wasashamed of the maps of Fremont and that he knew nothing about the country onlythe plain travelled road and that he could correct all the maps publishedof the Western world.We parted next day from Mr. Bridger who remarked that it would not be prudent to bring a great populationto the Bason until we ascertained whether grain would grow ornot. O. P. Rockwell and myself went forward to pick outa camp ground. It was fifteen miles from where we nooned beforewe could get grass and this made the longest day's journey we hadtravelled on the whole route making 23 3/4 miles.We travelled 8 miles on the last day of Juneand camped on the bank of the Green River at the Ferry and the afternoonwas spent in building a raft as the river was high and could only be crossedupon rafts or boats.During the afternoon the arrival of Elder Samuel S. Brannan from the bay of San Francisco was anounced in campand we were glad to meet with him to hear from the Saints who wentwith him. He gave us an account of their landing their travelsand present settlement which was two hundred miles up the river fromthe bay and they were putting in wheat and building up their place.During the two three following days we werefording Green River. On the afternoon of the second the Twelveheld a council and four men were appointed to return and meet theCamp of Israel and pioliot them up. We each wrote our voices concerningthe counsel to be given to the camp. I wrote a letter next dayto my father A. O. Smoot and John Benbow to be taken back by thepilots. The ferrying was finished on the evening ofthe third day and we moved on three miles and camped. 
 Indipendance DayJuly 4thThe Return of the First Detachment of the Mormon BattalionThe Fourth of July came on Sunday. I accompanied PresidentsYoung Kimball and Richards witand others with the pilots to the Ferry toput them across and when we arrived at the river we saw 13 horsemanon the opposite bankwith their baggage on one of our rafts. But to ourgreat joy who should they be but our brethren of the Mormon Battalionbelonging to Captain Brown's detachment who had been at Puebloduring the Winter. Amasa Lyman whom we had sentunto them had reached them with information of our movements andthe whole detachment of 140 of the brethren were within seven days drive of us.When we met these brethren it was trulya hearty greeting and shaking of hands. We crossed them all overthe river excepting one who returned with our pilots to meetthe following companies of the Saints. This small detachmentof the Battalion had about a dozen of their horses stolen by somehorse thieves but they overtook them and got them all back buttwo which had gone on to Bridger.We left Green River (the head waters of the Colerado) on the 5th drove 20 miles and camped on Black's Fork There was neither feed nor water between this place and Green River but simileer to the last 200 miles a sandy desertcovered with sagebrush.Next evening we camped on the westside of Hams Fork which we crossed on the following day anddrove to Fort Bridger. In the region of the fort before we goton to our camping ground we crossed more than a dozzen troutbrooks the water running swiftly but clear with hard cold gravellybuttons and the whole region of country up and down these. 
 streams was covered with grass a knee deep.The brethren caught several brook trout which wasthe first I had seen since I left England and as we were to spend the next day atthe Fort I calculated upon a day of fishing. So as soon as I had my breakfastnext morning I rigged up my trout rod that I had brought with me from Liverpoolfixed my reel line and artificial fly and went to one of the brooks close byto try my luck.The men at the Fort said that there were butvery few trout in the streams and a good many of the brethren were alreadyat the creeks with their rods trying their skill baiting with fresh meatand grasshoppers but no one was catching any.I went and threw my fly into the water andit being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in Americaor ever saw it tried I watched it as it floated upon the waterwith as much interest as Franklin did his kite string so was I highlygratified when I saw the nimble trout dart at my fly hook himselfand run away with the line but I soon worried him out anddrew him to shore.I fished two or three hours during themorning and evening and caught twelve in all. One half of themwould weigh 3/4 lbs each while all the rest of the camp did notcatch 3 lbs in all which was proof positive that the artificial fly isfar the best to fish with.In the afternoon I went to Bridger'shouse and traded off my flint lock riffle for four buffalo ecalveswhich were large nice and well dressed. At this fort I foundthings generally at least one thir[ink blot] higher than I had ever met atany anyother trading post I ever saw in Amerdica.I arose in the morning quite unwelland felt threatened with the camp Mountain fever yet I mounted myhorse and rode till ten o'clock but before I started I was called. 
 upon to administer to Bro Carter who was taken with the fever. There werenew cases of the Mountain fever every day in camp. At teno'clock I had to give up and take to my bed in the waggon with distressingpain in my head back joint bones marrow and all through my systemattended with cold chills and hot flashes through the body and we travelledover 13 miles of as bad road as any we had on our journey which madeit exceedingly painful to the sick. the day seemed very long to me.When we stoped at night I took composition cayeene and a doseof vegitable pills had a better night than I expecetd and thoughI was febeble in the morning I felt my fever was brokenup and I recovering.After this We camped for the night onthe 10th 1 1/2 miles from Bear River by the best stream of waterwe had found on the route and a small stream near by andWe had travelled this day up and down steep hills and passed througha valley six miles long grass knee deep strong mineral springscopper lead coal and lime.Camp fires were discovered about 3miles from our camping ground and Georg A Smith andothers went over to them and found it to be a Mr. MilesGooydyier. He had settled at Salt Lake and had a garden andvegitation he said doing well. Several Missourians were withwith him going to the States.The subject was brought up concerningthe emigrant company who perished in the Mountains last Winter.They were mostly from Indipendence and Clay counties Missouriand were a mob company that threatened to drive out theMormons who were in California and started with that spiritin their hearts. But it seemed as though they wereripe for judgement. The snows fell upon them 18 feetdeep on a level and they died and eat up each other. About40 persons perished and were mostly eaten up by those whosurvived them. Mrs L. Murphy of Tenn. whom I 
 baptized while on a mission in that country but since apostatized and joinedthe mob was in that company and died or was killed and eaten up and herbones sawed to pieces for her bones brains and marrow and left strewed upon theground.We spent the Sunday in camp but some of thebrethren rode out to seek out the road and found a tar spring about 15miles South of our camp.Early on the Monday morning I rode to BearRiver and for the first time I saw the long looked forBear River ValleyThe spot where we struck it was not very interesting. There wasconsiderable grass in the valley and some timber and thick brusheson the bank of the river. My object in riding to the river beforethe camp was to try my luck in fishing for trout. Afterfishing for several hours I started after the camp havingcaught 8 trout in all.The camp had travelled 9 miles and nooned in a valley. I found President Young very sick withthe fever. The company had started on but President Youngbeing so sick concluded not to move from where he was. BrothersKimball Benson Rockwood and others staid with him withtheir waggonsWe drove without any road over hillsand dales having to make our road as we went along. We campedat night l in Mathews Valley by the side of Reddings Cave. The valleyswere beginning to grow more fertile and the air more pacific.I arose quite unwell in the morning. Several brethrenwent to meet President Young, and the camp laid still waiting for him tocome up. Brother Kimball came at noon and a council of the wholewas called and it was resolved that Orson Pratt take a company of ^about^ 20waggons and 40 men and go on to the Kanyon and make a road as 
 they went along and if they could not go through Kanyon to find Smith's cutoffand make a road over the mountain so that we need not be hindered when wecame along. There were 23 waggons in all that started at 1'oclock.We had found but little game for many daysuntil yesterday when the Hunters brought in 12 antelope and 10 to day.President Young was better to day but designed notto move until to morrow. In the afternoon I walkedrode out with Elder Richardsin search of springs of water.Next In the morning I rode back 7 miles to visitPresident Young and found him much better in health and quite cheerfulThe evening before Dr Richards myself and George A Smith went beforethe Lord to pray for brother Young and we had a testimony that hewould recovered from that hour. I found brother Rockwood the sickestman that had been in our company. I tarried until near night assistingthe camp ^sick^ and then returned back to our encampment.I started early in the morrow with mycarriage and horses to go back for President Young and brother RockwoodI was two hours driving 7 miles to their camp. I found them muchbetter and they thought they could ride as my carriage was the easiestvehicle in our company. I made up a bed and took them both intomy carriage and the rest of the waggons started and drove to the mainbody and the sick seemed refreshed with their ride. After a short haltthe whole company drove 4 1/2 miles and camped for the nightNext day I again took Brothers Youngand Rockwood in my carriage and drove them during the day. Wehad bad road for the sick and brother Brigham was wearied out and worse at night. I went to Weber's Fork 1 mile from our encampmentat night and caught a trout for him.He was still sick in the morning and afterwe had driven three miles on to Weber's Fork we camped the remainderof the day in consequence of President Young being worse. The Twelveand others went out and prayed for him and the sick according tothe order of the Priesthood. 
 Sunday the 18th was spent holding meeting and on the morrowmorning 41 waggons went on among whom were Dr Richards and George A. Smith.15 waggons remained with President Young and two of mine were of the number.and In company with Heber C. Kimball E. T. Bensonand Howard Egan I rode over the mountain called Pratt's Pass with the companythat went on an then returned to President Young.Next morning we started early and stoped for breakfastafter a five miles drive. I carried brother Brigham in my carriage. Thefever was still on him but he stood the ride well.After breakfast we travelled 10 miles over the worseroad of the whole journey. Our camping ground this night was on a troutcreek. Here we found 3 waggons had tarried in consequence of thesick. Brothers Sherwood Johnson and Dewey were so sick theycould not journey and we camped with them and baptized them fortheir sickness and I confirmed them. This morning brother Pratt's companywere only 8 miles farther on than where where we camped at night.We remained in camp next day in consequenceof sickness. The stream we were on was Ogdon's Fork ^We were on East Kanyon Creek^ and the route wewere taking was Reed's Pass which we named Pratt's Pass in consequence ofhis going on to make the road.Next day 8 miles were made of our journey andEast Kaynon^nyon^ Creek the camping place. It was 8 miles of the worst ofroads and Brother Case smasshed one of his hind wheels to pieces and wehad to wait 2 hours to bring his waggon up. The sick stood the journeybetter than we expected during the day considering the bad road.We left East Kayno^nyo^n Creek on the 23rd andtravelled to the West five miles up hill which brought us to the summitand then descended the mountain 6 miles through a thick timbered groveThe timber had been cut out of the road yet it was full of stumps andit kept each teamster very busy to dogdge the stumps and not breakhis waggon. One man turned over his ox waggon and smashedthe tops all to pieces. There were two children in the waggon butthey were not hurt. 
 We nooned at a beautiful spring in a small birch groveThere was more timber during this half days travel than we had seen in a month andthe valleys both ascending and descending were extremely fertile and covered with vegitationto the tops of the hillsAt the spring where we nooned we were met bybrothers Pack and Mathews from the forward camps. They brought aletter to us & informed us that it was only 10 miles to the Valley of theGreat Salt Lake or Great Basin and 14 to their camp. They had explored the country as far as possible and made choice of a spot toput in crops.After nooning we travelled up another verytedious hill and down into a valley and camped for the night.Great Salt Lake ValleyReached by the PioneersJuly the 24, 1847This was an important day in the history of my life and inthe history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.After travelling from our encampment 6miles through the deep ravine valley ending with the Kayynyon we came in full view of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake or the GreatBasionâ€”the Land of Promise held in reserve by the hand of God fora resting place for the Saints.We gazed with wonder and admirationupon the vast fertile Valley spread out before us for about 25 milesand 16 in wedth clothed with a heavy garment of vegitation and in themidst of which glistened the waters of the Great Salt Lake withmountains all around lowering to the skys and streams rivlluletsand creeks of pure water running through the beautiful valley. 
 After a hard journey from Winter Quarters of 1200 milesthrough flats of the Platte River and steeps of the Black Hills and RockyMountains and over the burning sands and eternal sage regions willow swailsand rocky kayn^ny^ions to gaze upon a valley of such vast extent surrounded witha perfect chain of everlasting mountains covered with eternal snow with theirinnumerable peaks like pyramids towering towards heaven presented at oneview to us the grandest scenery and prospect that we could have obtained onearth. Thoughts of pleasant meditations ran in rapid successionthrough our minds at the anticipation that not many years hence theHouse of God would be established in the mountains and exalted abovethe hills while the valleys would be converted into orchards vineyardsand fields & planted with cities and the standard of Zion be unfurled forthe nations to gather.Ch. 29President Young expressed his full satisfactionin the appearence of the Valley as a resting place for the Saints and wasamply repaid for his journey ^and while tarying upon his bed in my carriage gazing upon the scene before him many things of the future concerning the valley was shown to him in vision.^After gazing awhile upon the scenery beforeus we travelled across the table land 4 miles into the Valley to theencampment of our brethren who had arrived two days before us. Theyhad pitched upon the bank of two small streams of pure water and hadcommenced plowing and broken about 5 acres of ground. They had alsobegan planting potatoes; and as soon as we were formed into the encampment before I took my dinner having 1/2 bushel of potatoesI went to the plowed field and planted them hoping with the blessingof God to save at least the seed for another year. The brethrenhad damed up one of the Creeks and dug a trench and by night nearlythe whole ground which was found very dry was irrigated.Towards evening brothers Kimball SmithBenson and myself rode several miles up the creek into the mountainsto look for timber see the country &c.There was a thunder shower and it rained nearly over the whole valley. It also rained some in the forepart of the night. We felt thankful for this as it was 
 the general conceived opinion that it did not rain in the Valley during theSummer season.The First Sunday In The ValleyJuly 25thThis was the first Sunday the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints spent in the Great Salt Lake Valley. Weshaved and cleaned up and met in the circle of the encampmentMeeting was opened by the Bishops andGeorge A Smith Preached the First SermonIt was an interesting discourse. Heber C. Kimball and E. T. Bensonfollowed.After an intermission of two hours the Church met again at 2 o'clock and the Bishops broke bread to thecongregation. I then addressed the brethren and was followed by Orson Pratt and Willard Richards. Several other brethren also expressedtheir feelings and all expressed the universal satisfaction with the Valleyand were joyfully disappointed at the whole prospect.At the close of the meeting President Young though feeble addressed the congregation for a few moments. Heinformed the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; thatthey would loose five times as much as they would gain by it.None were to hunt or fish on that day and there should not any mandwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might goand dwell where they pleased but should not dwell with us. Hesaid that no man should buy any land who came here that he hadnone to sell neither should he buy any but every man shouldhave his land measured out to him for city and farming purposesHe might till it as he pleased but he must be industrious andtake care of it. 
 On the Monday the camp in general was busily engagedin ploughing and planting corn and other seeds. Ten men were chosen for anExploring Expedition through the ValleyI took President Young into my carriage and travelled two miles towards themountain and made choice of a spot of ground for our garden with a smallrivlet running through it which I named garden Creek.We then returned to camp and went North aboutfive miles and we all went to the top of a high peak on the edge ofthe mountain which we considered a good place to raise an ensign. Towe named it Ensign PeakI was the first person who ascended this hillwhich we had thus named. Brother Young was very weary in climbingbeing feeble from his recent fever.We descended to the Valley and started North tovisit the hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drinkof cold water and then went back 4 miles to the Springs, and thenreturned to the camp quite weary. Brothers Mathews and Brownhad crossed the Valley in the narrowest place opposite the camp tothe West mountain and found it ^about^ 15 milesNext morning brother Amasa Lyman cameinto camp and informed us that Brown's detatchment of the MormonBattalion would be with us in about two days.We again started on our exploring expeditionBrother Lyman and all of the members of the Quorum of the Twelvein camp being 8 in number were of the company. Six others of thebrethren were with us among whom was Brannon from San Francisco.Visit to the Salt LakeWe started for the purpose of visiting the Salt Lake and mountainon the west of the Valley. We travelled two miles west from 
 Temple Block and came to the Utah outlet of the Utah Lake thence 14 milesto the West Mountain and found that the land was not near so fertile on thewest side of the Valley as on the East and but little fresh water as faras we went while the East side of the Valley was as well watered. as anyland I ever saw.We took our dinner at the fresh water pooland then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the Salt Lake wherewe made a halt and we all went into the Salt water. It was quite warm and inpregnated with as much salt as could possibly be dissolvedin water. No person could sink in it but would float and rollon the top like a dry log. While standing to our waist in waterwe could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top likecork. The whole body of the water would make at least 3 pintsof the best white salt to one gallon of water. There was a lot ofbeautiful white salt on the shore. We concluded that the SaltLake was one of the wonders of the world. After spendingan hour here we rode south on the Lake shore about 4 milesand then returned 10 miles to our place of nooning. The wholedistance of the day was 40 miles.We arose refreshed by sleep in the openand having lost my carriage whip the night before I startedin the morning on horseback to go after it.As I got near the place where it was dropedtwo objects appeared before me about half mile distant whom I tookat first for bears but after approaching a little nearer I discovered about 20 Indians and as I was unharmed I did not consider itprudent to go among them so I wheeled about my horse and startedon my return at a slow trot.As soon as I started back they calledto me and one mounted his horse and came after me with all speedWhen he got within 20 rods of me I stoped and met him and the rest followed on. I found them to be Utes and that theywanted to trade. I informed him by signs that our camp 
 was near so he went on with me to camp. From what we had yet seen of the Utahsthey appeared friendly though they had a bad name from the Mountaineers.The Indian wanted to smoke the pipe of peace with us but we soon started onand he waited for his company to come up.We travelled about 10 miles South under themountain on the West side of the Valley. The land beautiful butwe could not find any water and not as good soil as on the East. Thencewe turned our course towards the Pioneer encampment which we reachedweary after a journey through the day of 30 miles. We saw on the Westside of the Valley about a hundred goats sheep antelope &c playingabout the hills and Valley.The Temple Block SelectedJuly the 18th 1847After our return to the camp President Young called a council of the Quorum of the Twelve. There were presentBrigham Young Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt Willard RichardsWilford Woodruf George A Smith Amasa Lyman and E. T.BensonWe walked from the North camp to aboutthe centre between the two creeks when President Young wavedhis hands and said here is the 40 acres for the Temple and the citycan be laid out perfectly square North and South East and West. Wehad conversed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this.It was then moved and carried that the TempleLot contain 40 acres on the ground where we stood. It was also movedand carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each exclusiveof the streets and into blocks of 8 lots each being 10 acres in each block andone and a quarter in each lot.It was further moved and carried that each streetbe laid out 8 rods wide and that there be a side walk on each side 20 feetwide and that each house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from thefront line that there night be a uniformity throughout the city. 
 President Young remarked that he wished but one housebe built upon a lot and they being in the centre if they took fire they would notburn up their neighbours and if any man wanted a market to have it uponhis own lot and not to lay out public grounds for a market place. Let every mancultivate his own lot and set out every kind of fruit trees and shade trees and beautifythe city.It was moved and carried that there be fourPublic Squares of 10 acres each to be laid out in various parts of the City forPublic Grounds. This was in Lot 40Â° 45 44.At 8 o'clock the whole camp came together on thesame ground and passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded andwhen the business part of the meeting was closed President Young arosed and addressed the assembly upon a varity of subjects.In his remarks President Young remarked that he was determined to have all things in order and righteousness should be practisedin the land. We had come here according to the direction and counselof brother Joseph Smith before his death and that he would still have beenalive if the Twelve had been in Nauvoo when he re-crossed the river fromMontrose to Nauvoo.He spoke of the Saints being driven from placeto place and said the only way Boggs Clark Lucas Benton and all the leadersof the mob could be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntarily and let their heads be cut off and let theirblood run upon the ground and go up as a smoking inscense before theHeavens as an atonement but now they will be eternally damned.All the Presidents and Governors of the UnitedStates had rejected all our petitions from first to last. When the Saintswere driven from Illinois to perish on the prairies then President Polksends for a draft of 500 men to go into the army. What for? Thatthey might be worasted away and their wives and children he wastedaway that we might be entirely wasted away as a people. If thebrethren had not gone they would have made war upon us and theGovernor of Missouri would have been ordered not to let us cross the 
 Missouri. The raising of the Battalion was our temporal salvation at the time.Polk will be damned for this act. He with many of theGovernment had a hand in the death of Joseph and Hyrum and we will never cease ourexertions until the blood of the Prophets and Saints is avenged.He said that he intended to have every hole and corner fromthe Bay of San Francisco to Hudson Bay known to us, and many more things hespoke of important to our people.Arrival of the Mormon BattalionJuly the 29, 1847.President Young with his brethren the Twelve and othersmounted our horses and started to meet the Battalion under the commandof Captain Brown.Some of them were met about 4 miles from campand we continued on and soon met with Capts Brown Higgins Liut. Willis andthe train following them and I met brother Bevin who went from my familyinto the army. There were about 140 of the Battalion and a companyof about 100 of the Mississippie Saints that came with them from Pueblobeing about 60 waggons in all 100 horses & mules and 300 head of cattle whichadded greatly to our numbers.We had a heavy shower of rain while we werein the Kanyon which sent the water in the creeks from the mountainswith a rush and roar like thunder resembling the opening of a flood gateThe first rush of water came down with a front 3 feet high. The showerspread over a good share of the Valley where we were settled.We returned at the head of the companies andmarched into camp with music and they took up their quarters betweenour two camps on the bank of the creek.While we had been exploring the rest of thePioneers had been farming putting in potatoes corn beans peas buckwheatand preparing a garden for garden seeds. Today our garden was 
 divided off as each had need.In the evening Brother Young and the Twelve went to the Warm Springs and bathedNext day we met in Council â€” the TwelveCapts  Brown Higgins Willis and others and heard the statement of the officersconcerning the Battalion and their situation and counsel was given byPresident Young what course to persueIt was deemed wisdom for Capt Brown and others to go to the Bay of San Francisco and report himselfmen and the State and brother Brannan was to go as their pilotAfter the Council broke up we mountedour horses and rode to the Warm Springs and visited the Hot SulpherSpring and on our return I visited the Battalion and then the plantingground and found some of our potatoes had rotted and some were comingup. Our corn was also up and our beans.At 8 o'clock oin the evening all thecamp met together and was addressed for more than an hour byPresident Young. He expressed his feelings freely concerningthe treatment of the Government towards us as on the 28th.The meeting opened by the assembly witha shout of Hosannah to God and the Lamb repeated three timeswith its Amen. Brother Young said the Ancient of Dayswas not as far off as many supposed.On the Saturday the Battalion went to work at the Bowery and our Camp of Pioneers sowing and planting.At About noon a company of about 20 Utahsvisited our camp. They came to trade with us and while doingso one Indian struck another over the head with his gun and brokeit and the old chief whipped them both. In the afternoonthe one who had the gun broke over his head stole the others horseand made off with him. The Indians followed and shot bothhim and his horse dead and they returned to our camp an Thepolicy to be pursued with the Indians came up and President 
 Young and others expressed their viewsFirst Meeting In the BowerySunday August the 1st 1847The congregation assembled under the Bowery on the Temple Blockat 10 o'clock and the meeting was opened by singing and prayer. Brother Kimballfirst addressed the mecongregation and then was followed by a discourse from OrsonPratt upon the prophices of Isaiah and their fulfilment in our present location andthe building up of Zion.When Elder Pratt concluded Willard Richards read a letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who went with it to thePacific and he spoke in the highest terms of praise of the members of theBattalion in all their proceedings. A letter was also read from Capt Hunt; andthen Brother Kimball made some remarks upon our relations with the Indians.In the afternoon the revelation given at WinterQuarters was read by Elder Willard Richards and received a unanimous vote and then the congregation was addressed by Elder Amasa Lyman. A votewas taken to cease entirely trading with the Indians, and it was decidedto form all the encampments into one.In the evening the Twelve met and decidedfor brother E. T. Benson to go back with 3 others with him to meetthe camp get the mail and bring word concerning the Saints who werefollowing the Pioneers.On the Monday Brother Benson startedand we commenced laying out the city beginning with the Temple BlockIn forming the Temple Block 40 acres appeared so large that we held a councilto determine if it would or not be wisdom to reduce it to one half. G. A. Smithbelieved if we did it we should be sorry and would rather enlarge than diminishHeber C. Kimball thought we should let it be as it was even if we set itout to shrubery Amasa Lyman said George A. Smith had spoken his mindwe all ran in the same channel and President Young said we could easier 
 diminish than enlarge it afterwards and it was determined that we let it remain asit was.Two days afterwards we again met upon thesubject and as it was considered that we could not do justice to 40 acresto begin with we should limit the Temple and garden to 10 acres.As we were under the necessity of returningsoon it was thought best to go into the mountains to draw logs to buildourselves cabins as the "dobie" houses might not be ready for our useBrothers Young and Kimball had commenced drawing out logsfor their buildings and brother George A. Smith and myself concludedto join our efforts.So on the morning of the 5th of August Itook my axe and in company with brother Smith went to the mountainabout six miles distance with several men with us to assist in choppingWe found a grove of fir trees that we thought would answer our purposebut we had to make a road and bridges across the creek to it. Idreaded the job for it was a hard one and I do not exercise the prudenceI ought when I take hold of hard labour. We chopped and drewhome to the Fort more than enough to build one house 16 feet squareand drew 25 logs home to the Fort. I was weary and myhands blistered for I had done much the most work.We started again next day with five teamsand 4 teams went also for Dr. Richards and in the two dayswe had cut and drawn 77 logs for our two buildings.That morning I had arisen quite sore withthe labour of the previous day and on going into the Valley  for myhorses could not find them and we supposed the Indians had driventhem off for they had been in Camp during the night so horsemenwere sent out to drive in all the horses in the Valley and much toour joy we found none had been stolen this Increased our confidencein the Indians around us.I had ridden 8 miles without a saddleand was fatigued by it but after we had found our horses I saddled 
 my horse and took my axe and went on before the teams and cut down 5 large firtrees before they came up and during the two days I laboured so hard that whenwe got home I could hardly stand upon my feet and I went into my waggonand threw myself on my bed to rest.I had not been there but a short time beforeHeber C. Kimball called upon me and informed me that the Twelve weregoing to the water to be rebaptized for the remission of sins to set exampleto the whole Church and that the brethren would be called upon on Sundayto follow the example.The Twelve Re-baptizedAugust the 6th 1847We considered this a duty and a privilege as we had come intoa glorious Valley to locate and build up Zion. We felt like renewingour covenants before the Lord and each other and we soon repared tothe water and President Young went down into the water andbaptized all his brethren of the Twelve present and confirmed us andsealed upon us our Apostleship and all the keys powers and blessingsbelonging to that office. Brother Heber C. Kimball baptizedand confirmed President Brigham Young. The following were thenames and order of those present; Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt Willard Richards Wilford WoodruffGeorge A. Smith and Amasa LymanSelecting Their InheritancesIn the afternoon of the next day the Twelve went on to Temple Blockand picked out their inheritances. President Young took a block Eastof the Temple and running South East to settle his friends around him;Brother Heber C. Kimball took a block North of the Temple whereon tosettle his friends; Orson Pratt South of the Temple Block and runningSouth; Wilford Woodruff took a block cornering Temple Block and at 
 the South West corner joining Orson Pratts block; Amasa Lyman took ablock 40 rods below or West of Wilford Woodruff's and running S. Westto settle his friends and George A Smith took one joinging the Templeon the West and running due West. It was supposed that Brother Richardswould take his on the East near President Young's None others of the Twelveof the Twelve were present in camp.During the same evening the Twelve wentto City Creek To City Creek and Heber C. Kimball baptized 55 membersof the camp for the remission of their sins and they were confirmed underthe hands of President Young Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A. Smithand Amasa Lyman: Brigham Young being mouth.General Baptism of the PioneersAugust the 8th 1847Sunday Morning at six o'clock the Bishops reparedto the streams of water for the purpose of baptizing the whole campof Israel for the remission of sins and the renewal of their covenantsbefore the Lord.Brothers Lewis Goddard Everett ShumwaySnow and Heber C. Kimball baptized and the Twelve confirmed themThere were two hundred and twenty four baptized and confirmed this morning99 of whom I confirmed with my own hands. This made 288 in allwho had been re-baptized during the last three days.The camp assembled as usual at 10 o'clockfor public meeting and was addressed by Heber C. Kimball who spokemuch to our edifycation. I followed and was never blessed with greaterliberty of speech.In the afternoon we again met and partookof the Sacrament. Brother Lorenzo Young addressed the peopleand was followed by President Brigham Young who was febeble in healthAfterwards 110 men were called upon to go into the adobie yard and76 volunteered. 
 I spent the Monday in making a sawpit on the next ^day^ in preparingtimber for our dwellings in the Fort. It had been decided to enclose one block of 10 acres with adobie sand log buildings as a Fort.The North East corner was laid out as follows:Brigham Young 4 rooms Lorenzo Young 2 Heber C. Kimball 5 rooms WillardRichards 2 rooms Wilford Woodruff 2 ^George A. Smith 2 A. Lyman 2^ Erastus Snow 1: all the rooms were to be14 feet wide and as long as we chosose. George A Smith and myself buildtogether.Brother Crow had a [grand]child drowned on the 11th.On the 13th the Twelve held council. Each one was to makechoice of the blocks that they were to settle their friends upon. Brother Brighamtook two tiers of blocks South through the city Brother Kimballs runsNorth and N. W. Orson Pratt 4 blocks Wilford Woodruff 8 blocks GeorgeA. Smith 8 and Amasa Lyman 12 blocks according to the companiesorganized with them.Next day 4 of the Messengers returned fromBear River and Cache Valleys. They had gone with Capt. Brown whohad started with a company to San Francisco Bay via Fort Hall.The returned messengers brought a cheeringreport of Cache Valley and the country between us and there. The soilwas rich well watered and well calculated for farming purposes andBear River ^Valley^ for grazing &c.The brethren also returned that went to UtahLake to get fish and they found a mountain of granite good for buildingrunning from 7 to 15 miles from camp. The Quorum of theTwelve decided in council that the name of our city should be the "City of the Salt Lake".Remarks by President YoungSunday August 15th"I am going to day to speak upon the subject of the PatriarchalPriesthood and by request of brother Crow say something upon the death of 
 his [grand]child by drowning the other day. I hope to speak so as to be understood.There is a reality in eternal things as much as inthe things of time which we daily see with our eyes. When a man hasa dream or vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as thoughhe saw it with his own eyes in one sense of the word.The Lord has hid from man the things thathe knew before he came into the flesh that he might walk by faithand prove himself while here. The Lord converses with man on the earthin the form of a servant and by visions and dreams &c but he never appearedto man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory for He is as a consumingfire and a mortal body would paerish in an instant in His presence.The Priesthood is again restored to the earthto bring that which was lost. We do not receive all at once but wereceive grace for grace. When brother Joseph received the Priesthoodhe did not receive all at once. He was a Prophet Seer and Revelatorbefore he had the fulness of the Priesthood and keys of the Kingdom. Hefirst received the Aaronic Priesthood and keys from under the handsof John the Baptist. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] He then had not power to lay on hands to confirmthe Church but afterwards he received the Patriarchal or Melchisidick Priesthoodfrom under the hands of Peter James and John who were of the TwelveApostles and were the Presidency when the other Apostles were absent. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##]From those Apostles Joseph Smith receivedevery power blessing and privilege of the highest authority of the MelchisidickPriesthood ever committed to man on the earth.Some have had fears that we had not powerto get revelations since the death of Joseph. But I want this subject from thistime and forever to be set at rest; and I want the Church to understand fromthis day henceforth and forever that an Apostle is the highest office andauthority that there is in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth.From whom did Joseph receive his authority?From just such men as set around me here -[pointing to the Twelve Apostleswho sat with him]- Peter James and John were Apostles and there was no noise about their being Seers and Revelators though those 
 gifts were among them. Joseph Smith gave unto me and my brethren the Twelveall the Priesthood Keys power and authority which he held and those are powers which belong to the Apostleship.In Joseph's day we had to ordain Patriarchs. Couldwe ordain men to authority greater than we held ourselves? No. But it is necessaryto have Patriarchs to bless the people that they may have blessings by the Spirit ofprophecy and revelation sealed upon their heads and their posterity and to know what awaitstheir posterity.Father Smith was the senior Patriarch in theChurch and first Patriarch in our day and afterwards Hyrum was the seniorPatriarch for his father sealed it upon his head. But wasere thereir power and authoritydifferent from that of all Patriarchs in the Church? No. There were all alike in theirauthority in blessing.Elijah is spoken of in the Bible that he should comein the last days to turn the Hearts of the fathers to the children and the childrento their fathers. [##Malachi 4:5-6##] The fulfilment of this Scripture is manifest in establishingthe Kingdom of God and Priesthood on the earth in the last days and those whohold the keys of the Priesthood and sealing power have the Spirit and Power ofElijah and it is necessary in order to redeem our dead and save our children.There is much more importance attached to thisthan parents are aware of.In the loss of this [grand]child of Brother Crow that wasdrowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feelings; forI realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. It is true allchildren are saved. Their names are written in the Lamb's book of lifewhich was the case with every Spirit that takes a tabernacle on this earthTheir names were written there before the world was made and will thereever remain until they sin against the Holy Ghost. It will then beblotted out no more to be reatcorded for ever.But notwithstanding this can Brother Crow getthat child again or any other persons their children except there is something donefor them on the earth by their parents? No they would not. They theywould go to God who gave them but the parents ^on earth^ would not have them 
 The parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the Spirit and what is thebody good for without the spirit? What then can be done? I will tell youA man that has embraced the Gospel must go to some one who has the Priesthoodand keys and power of Elijah and must attend to ordinances for that child evenmust be baptized for it as well as to have it sealed to him and through this mediumclaim his child in the morning of the resurrection and the Lord will give it upto him.I had my children sealed to me in the Templeexcept one that died and that I shall leave in the hands of the Lord until I haveanother opportunity.As soon as we get up some adobie houses for our families we shall go to work to build another Temple and as soon as a place isprepared we shall commence the endowments long before the Temple is builtand we shall take time and each step the Saints take let them taketime enough about it to understand it.Everything at Nauvoo went with a rushWe had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand and the sword in theother and mobs were upon us all the while and many crying out, "O theTemple cant be built!" I told them it should be built. This Churchshould not fall and the Lord said if we did not build it we should berejected as a Church with our dead. Why did He say it? Becausethe Saints were becoming slothful and covetous and would spend their moneyupon fine houses for themselves before they would put it into a house forthe Lord.  But we went at it and finished it and turned it overinto the hands of the Lord in spite of earth and hell and the brethren was so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give them their endowment.The children want to be sealed to their parents andparents to their children that they may have blessings in eternity which theywill stand in  need of.God promised to Abraham that his seed should beas numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea shore and tohis seed there should be no end. [##Genesis 22:17##] This of course would continue to alleternity the same blessings upon our heads if we are faithful for 
 our eyes have not seen nor our ears heard neither entered into our hearts the great things thatGod has in store for us.And when I look upon the great work the Elders of Israel have to perform and look around upon them and see them vain and foolish, it makesme sorrowful. They forget their calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a moment what manner of persons ought ye to be? men who hold the Priesthood and keys of salvation and have power to go to the nations of the earth and say to the peopleI have salvation for you and power to exalt you to celestial glory or if you rejectit to seal you unto damnation.It is no trifling affair to have power put into your handto deal with the eternal destinies of the sons and daughters of Adam who formthe nations of the earth.While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted to cut off theGentiles who rejected the Gospel and killed the Prophets and it was recorded on earthand it is recorded in Heaven. That nation will go down quickly!"Many other interesting and important items were presentedby President Young.In the afternoon Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow preachedand in the evening President Young met with the company who were to start backin the morning with the ox teams: there were over 60 in number. Many ofthe Battalion deposited with him their guns for safe keepingOn the evening of the 20th while unloading the lastload of logs for our houses one stick fell on Bro George A Smiths head knockedhim down cut a hole in his head and hurt him badlyIn Conference with the Twelve and Saints on Sundaythe 22nd it was resolved by the public Assembly to call this place, "TheCity of the Great Salt Lake" of the Great Bason North America; thestream running through the city, City Creek; the Utah outlet WesternJordan and two creeks coming out of the mountain Great Kanyon Creekand Little Kanyon Creek and one large stream Mill Creek. It wasalso voted to fence the city for farming purposes the coming year andto appoint a President and High Council and all other necessary officersin this Stake of Zion and that the Twelve write an epistle to leave 
 with the Saints in the City of the Great Salt Lake. Adjourned until the6th of October A. D. 1848.The Pioneer Camp ReturningtoWinter QuartersAugust the 26, 1847The morning the Pioneer Camp with a large number of the Battalionharnessed up our horses and bade farewell to our friends who were to tarryI put a pair of mules on my carriage and brother Stillman drove them and I rode on horse back.On the 4th day of our journey we were metby our massengers E. T. Benson and companions who had been on tomeet the camp of Saints bound for the Valley of the Great Salt LakeThey were truly welcome messengers for our anxiety to hear from ourfamilies had been great. The coming Camp numbered nearly600 waggons and were divided into 9 companies. I received threeletters from Mrs. Woodruff and one from A. O. Smoot. My fatherwas coming along but Mother Woodruff had gone back to Iowa tolive with my sister Eunice and her husband.We reached Fort Bridger on the 31st and onthe 3rd of September upon the Big Sandy to our great joy we metthe first Fifty of the 6 hundred waggons: they belong to brotherSpencer's Hundred. A meeting of the Camp was held in theevening and addressed by George A. Smith Brigham Young Heber C.Kimball and Wilford Woodruff.On the 4th we travelled to Little Sandy and to mar met Captain Session's Fifty and also Parley P. Pratt's Fifty.In the afternoon the quorum of the Twelveconvened together and we had one of the most interesting councils we ever heed [had]together. At the commencement two of the quorum wassharply reproved for undoing what the majority of the quorum had done 
 in the organization of the camps for travelling. At first it was not received but afterwardsthe error was seen and confessed. Much teaching was given by President Youngand the power of God rested upon us and our hearts were melted.The President said if he did not tell us of our faultswe should be destroyed but if he told us of them and reproved us we should live inlove in love and our hearts be cemented together.Brothers Parley Pratt and John Taylor had been to Englandand done a good work but had returned to Winter Quarters and disorganizedthe two divisions and companies that the quorum of the Twelve had spent thewhole Winter in organizing and which was also governed by revelation. BrotherParley took the lead; and President Young chastized him for his course andtaught us principle. He said that when we set apart one or more of theTwelve to go and do a certain piece of work they would be blessed in doingthat and the quorum would back up what they did, but when one or moreof the quorum interfere with the work of the majority they burn their fingersand do wrong. When the majority of the Twelve plant a Stake of Zion and establish a President over the Stake and appoint a High Councilhas the minority of the Twelve one or more any right to go and interferewith those councils? No; unless they should get corrupt and do wrong.Then it would be the duty of any one of the Twelve to show them their errorand teach them what was right: and should the majority of those Councilsget corrupt and try to lead astray the people it would then be the dutyof any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils and call upon thepeople to sustain him and appoint a new one; but while the councilsare trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might bewith them to assist in carrying out the views that the majority of theTwelve had established.The quorum all decided that Brother Parley Pratthad committed an error in not carrying out the emigration ^organization^ as established bythe Twelve.Brother Parley was led to confess his fault and the powerof God rested upon the whole quorum and President Young and thathe felt eternity upon him and was weighed down with to the earth with 
 this work and that brother Kimball felt the weight of it more than any other manexcept himself. He should chastise any one of the quorum when out of theway. He had done it for their good and was constrained to do it by the power of God.Brother Heber C. Kimball addressed brother Young and wished him to rest as much as possible and let his brethren to bear hisburdens. He said he wanted brother Brigham to save himself for he was wearing down. "I feel tender toward you and want you to liveand if I or my brethren do wrong tell us of it and we will repent."Brother Brigham observed that there was not a betterlot of men on earth than the Twelve but when they needed it he shouldchastise them that they might be saved.Each of the quorum present expressed his feelingsand we all felt it good to be there for the Lord was with us.Next day we travelled to the Springs and here met three Fifties. Here I found in brother Smoots company my fatherand many from our Ward.After supper we held a meeting of all thecamps when George A Smith Wilford Woodruff and Orson Prattaddressed them. It was decided by vote to tarry over the morrow.The Twelve held council on the day of our tarryand settled some important matters and in the evening at Dr. Richard'swe heard read the Epistle to the Saints in the Great Salt LakeValley.On the 7th we bade farewell to the Valley boundcompanies and continued our journey towards Winter Quarters.We travelled 14 miles and camped on theSweet Water with John Taylor's company and also Edward Hunter'sThe ground was covered with snow which continued to fall till evening.The Hundred prepared a feast for the wholePioneer Camp and furnished a table here in the wilderness infine style. Our feast consisted of roast and broiled beef 
 pies cakes biscuit butter Peach sauce coffee tea sugar and a great variety of goodthings. In the evening the Camp had a dance but the Twelve met in councilat brother Shirtliff's tent and transacted the business that came before themfor adjustment.Fourteen miles were travelled farther on the morrow andthen we met brother J. M Grant's Hundred.Brother Grant had burried a child on the road andhis wife lay at the point of death.In the evening we held a council and heard from Brother Jedediah the circumstances of the organization of the companiesand Brother Brigham said he was more than ever convinced that there waswrong in this matter. Brother Grant also related his interview withCol T Cane who had the Spirit of the Lord with him and was workingfor us but Thomas Benton was our inveterate enemy and was doing all he could against us.Our Horses Stolen By The IndiansThe alarm was given early next morning that a lot ofour horses and mules were stolen. Bells were found cut from thehorses the lariettes cut an arrow picked up and other Indian signs. Thetrail was finally found and a company of 20 horsemen started afterthe Indians.It looked gloomy to see so many women and childrenhere in the mountains with their horses and cattle stolen and breakingdown so late in the season. Thirty horses were taken from thePioneer Camp and 20 from the other camps which was quite cripplingto us.The camps remained together during the dayand in the evening assembled for meeting and was addressed byOrson Pratt Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young.During the evening 2 of our brethren returned whohad been in pursuit and brought back five of the horses. 
 Next morning we parted with our friends who weregoing Hest ^West^ and those of us who had not lost horses divided with those whohad. As we journied on we met the remainder of our brethren returningfrom pursuing the horses but they did not obtain any more of them. Theenemy had escaped with 43 of our horses.Our Camp Attacked By 200 Indian WarriorsSeptember the 21st 1847Two weeks later than the time when the Indians stole so manyhorses from us we had another immensely exciting Indian fray.About 9 o'clock in the morning the call was madeto get our horses. I started for them in the timber half mile fromCamp. When I got about two thirds of the way to the horsesone of the most exciting scenes occurred I ever witnessed.I hear several reports ^of  guns^ in quick successionand our Guard cry "Indians! Indians!"In less than a minute the timbered ^and^ bluffs werelined with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard horsesand camp. They shot at two or three of the guard but missed themOne of our guard they ^two of them^ took and tried to carry him off on his horse. Heknocked some of them down with his fist and got away. Someof the brethren snaped their guns but they missed fire.As soon as I heard the report of guns andthe cry of Indians and saw them driving off our horses and gathering thick and fast upon every hand being without either horse or arms I ranto camp with all speed and gave the alarm and called upon all togather their arms and mount their horses.Brothers Kimball Rockwood Mathewsand several others sprang on to their horses with their guns and pistolsand ran to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away.One party of Indians had driven five or ^about^ 
 six ^a dozen^ horses and mules over the hills. Brother Kimball took after them. Two Indians had gone over the Bluff with my horse and mule: Brother Rockwood tookafter them and at the same time about 20 of our horses came rushing towardscamp frightened by the Indians. With great exertion President Young andone or two other brethren succeeded in stoping them and getting them intoour camp.As soon as I arrived in camp I opened my trunktook out my belt containing 8 pistols ^shots^ and harnessed ^buckled^ it on to myself as quickas possible put a saddle and bridle on to a broken down horse for want ofa better one and mounted without spupr or whip and gave chase after myown horses. I could not ride very fast over the rough ground and bluffson a poor horse but I went as fast as I could.As soon as I began to rise the bluffs I sawIndians gathering thick on every hand closing in between me and the campAs I passed one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued thechase.While putting up a ravine with steep bluffs oneach side an avalanche of some 30 Indians rushed down upon me andhedged me in so that I could not get out. Within a few feet of mea large Indian drew a gun upon me. I presented a six shooterat his breast and gave a yell which I had no sooner done than hegave a whoop and ran up the hill and left me and all the other Indianssurrounding me followed his example and ran.As soon as my horse and mule had got over theirfright and got out of sight of camp they tried to return to it and troubledthe Indians in driving them and brother Rockwood soon came nearthem and one stoped and met him when they found they were overtakenand professed friendship but the other still tried to drive off the horsesand brother Rockwood fired a pistol at him and he ran and the otherIndian did the same and brother Rockwood started my horses towardsme and I soon came to his assistance also some other brethren andwe catched them.While this was going on nearly 40 Indians 
 surrounded brother Kimball and some of the brethren started to his assistance.Indians were also upon every side ^of me^ until 2 got tothe camp and the brethren who had helped me had gone to the aid ofbrother Kimball.By this time 150 warriors had gathered close toour camp all dressed in the greatest still for a war charge; and the old chief began to address at the top of his voice the Indian band andalso our camp telling us that they were good Sionx and they had thoughtwe were Crows or Snakes.When they found they could not get any moreof our horses and that three had been re-taken which they had stolenthey professed friendship. There were 11 horses in all taken bythe Indians who numbered about 200 warriors on the ground whowere well mounted and there were not more than 20 meof our menincluding our guard who were engaged in any way against themin stoping them or retaking our horses.Brother Gould took one Indian horseand all and another Indian brought back Thomas Woolsey's horsewhich was among the stolen and exchanged him for the Indianhorse. This with my two horses were the only onesretaken during the skirmish.But when the Indian Warriors gatheredbefore our camp they saw that we as a body were armed and that we knew them and had treated them kindly on our way to the Valley.The old chief then proposed that we smokethe pipe of peace and said that if our chief pointing to President Youngwould go to their camp they would smoke with him and give upthe horses which his men had taken. Brother Brigham was notwell and we did not think it prudent for him to go.While in this conversation with the IndiansBrother Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses returnedbare headed (having droped his hat) accompanied by brother Bensonand in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the. 
 Indians and they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon themin the rear instantly leaped upon their horses scattered and dashed from the campsome running into the creek and all appeared in great fright; but as soon as theysaw that no harm was designed they returned and took their places and had ahearty laugh at their fright.Brother Kimball volunteered to accompany thechief into his camp in the place of President Young that we might get our horsesI volunteered and also Stephen Markham volunteered to go with Brother Kimballon the expedition and so we three mounted our horses and set out accompanied bya Frenchman who could speak a little Sioux language.The Indians told us their camp was one mileaway but we travelled 7 miles over Bluffs and Valleys before we came in sight of their camp some three miles distant moving towards us.So we halted and waited for them and theycame and pitched about 100 lodges. Their were some 600 Indians menwoman and children and they brought with them about 1000 horses and mulesall of which we supposed were stolen from emigrants and other tribes. Theirencampment presented a very picturesque and amusing appearance.Among their horses we readily descovered ourswhich were stolen on the night we camped with brother Grant's companyWe lost 49 that night and they were here in the drove which theseIndians had.The old chief called ^together^ the war chiefs and placedthem on his left hand and ourselves on his right and set down upon thegrass and filled a long pipe with Keunickennisick and smoke and passed it to his chiefs; they smoked and passed it to us and we also smokedin turn.The old Chief then pointed to us to pick out ourhorses which we undertook to do but we found it no easy task to pickout 8 or 9 horses scattered through one thousand others for one or twomiles up the creek.  However after a labor^i^ous search we got allbut two that were stolen this morning. We then spoke to himabout the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before and 
 they acknowledged they had the horses butand gave us some ancouragent ^encouragement^ of letting ushave them when we got to Laramie but would not let us have them thenexcepting only one. The brethren brought 3 bushels of salt as a presentto the chief. We returned to camp and this ended the scenes and business of the day.We reached Laramie on the 24th andBrothers Young, Kimball, Benson and myself dined with Mr. Burdowand talked to him about our stolen horses. He informed usthat our company with the ox teams lost every horse they had but theygot them back excepting five. He gave us some encouragement ofsending an Interpreter with us.We crossed the Platte and pitched ourcamp about 3 miles from the Fort and President Young called us togetherand addressed us at some length and appointed 10 men to go andvisit the Indians to get our stolen horses and 25 men to follow afterto assist in case of necessity.Next morning at 9 o'clock the firstcompany of 10 men commanded by Col. Markham started on theirIndian expedition and an hour afterwards the 2 of 25 men followedhan^under^ the command of Brother Benson but it was not long beforeboth companies returned having ascertained that a man had gone forwardto inform the Indians of our coming and to have them ckacheup their horses.In the evening we received word that BrothersJohnson and Little had returned on the road to us and had fallenin the with Commodore Stockton from the Bay of San Francisco with40 men going to the S[t]ates.Next morning, Sunday, Brothers Johnsonand Little reached the Fort with two other brethren bringing us tenhorses for which we were indeed glad for we had as much as wecould do to get along and our horses were daily growing poor. BrothersYoung, Kimball and others dined at the Fort with Commodore Stockton.In the afternoon we drove three miles 
 on our journey and camped.We were now nearly out of bread and meat and thiswas the case for some days to come but we killed a little and obtained somemeat from Mr. Benshaw the ^an^ Indian Trader and he promised to come over theriver with some Indians and kill some buffalo for us but we missed eachother and we did not have our buffalo hunt on the 1st of October for whichwe had prepared. On this evening Com^m^odore Stockton arrived and said hewould like to journey with us but he changed his mind next morning and concluded to travel on the North Side of the Platte.We bought some half dozen horses of the Indiantrader.Wonderful Discipline of a Buffalo HerdIn company of Luke Johnson I left camp on the 3rdto get some meat. We started at daybreak and the wolves which hadrent the air during the night were dispersing in all directions as we rodealong and the beautiful swan in flocks were floating upon the Platteadding beauty to the scene.Soon a large herd of buffalo was in sightand we left our horses and stole upon them the best we could and theirpicket guards were frightened several times but we managed to re-assurethem. There is no well-diciplined army of men more particularto have an old experienced guard on a close look out than a herdof Buffalo.By going under a bank we passed their guardsand lay ^lyn^ ^lying^ concealed until we were surrounded and the main bodieswere comming on to us with a heavy phalansx of bulls meeting usin the face with the cows fallowing in their rear.When they were within a few rods of us wethought it time to be up and doing for our own safety. I had a singleload in my rifle and a brace of pistols and Johnson a slide of six loadsin his rifle. He fired twice and they broke and ran. None were 
 killed. I then put a ball into a young cow. She hobbled off and I walkedover the ridge and shot her through the heart strings and lungs & Shedroped dead. Johnson mounted and rode some distance after the herd but mycow was the only one we got. We travelled a erfew miles farther and brotherAmasa Lyman killed two more and an antelope. The meat was broughtinto camp and divided. ^dev^On the morning of the 5th a company of 10men were dispatched on foot to overtake the ox teams and stop them untilwe should come up as our horses were breaking down. We learned froma board stuck up on the way that they had tarried five days for usand killed and dried 30 buffalo cows and they were still about oneweek ahead of us.On the 8th while we nooned we thought we saw approaching in the distance a band of mounted warriors butby the aid of our spy glasses we found them to beA Band of Elk.They made a splendid appearence. I went up a swail of tall grassand the band came within 10 rods of me their horns waving above thetall weeds like rocking chairs. I drew my gun for a doe; butat this instant another man came up behind me and they saw himand broke and ran. He shot after them but to no effect. Theyran near a Frenchman and he shot a doe and I got a piece of herfor supper. This was the first Elk I ever eate.On the 16th just before camping the brethren returned whom we sent after the ox teams. They could notgain upon them and all except two gave it up. Brother Luke Johnsoncame near being trampled to pieces by a large herd of Buffalo travellingin the night. They came upon him suddenly and he wascaught in their midst and they were 15 minutes passing himThe only way he had to keep them from trampling him down wasby striking out on each side with his stick punching them and yelling. 
 As they passed him they opened a lane in the herd just wide enough for him tostand and he thus escaped being trampled to death.Hunting ExpeditionOct. 17thWe were now passt the buffalo ground and as our camp hadnot enough meat it was deaemed wise for a company of Hunters to return backSo about 20 of us including butchers and teamsters returned 10 miles with threewaggons and pitched our camp in a little timber on a slough and during theevening we killed two buffalo.After cutting the body of meat from the bones we roastedthem for our supper and breakfast and at the two meals we ate ^picked^ the bones ofof the two buffaloes. It is incredible what an amount of buffalo meata hungry man will eat without salt or bread and not make him sick. Thehump bones of a fat buffalo rosasted is most delicious and the leg bonesare filled with marrow which we drank without bread. As we sat aroundour fireside we should have been ^made^ a delightful picture for an artistto have drawn.At daylight in the morning 4 of us went to theBluffs to observed the position of the herds. After breakfast we dividedinto twos. Luke Johnson went with me and we saw while outthree wild horses and they were splendid looking creatures.We found that the herds on the uplandwere travelling to the N. & N. E. and the only way to obtain meat wasfor the hunters to confine themselves to the herds on the flat. Ninebuffalo were killed ^most of them by Amasa Lyman^ but only seven of them were dressed and broughtinto camp: the wolves feasted on the other two. We got counsel toreturn to the main body early in the morning.Met By the Police From Winter QuartersOctober the 19thIn accordance to our instructions we started early in the morningto return to the main camp and when about a mile on our way 
 we discovered 7 men about 2 miles from us coming from some scattered timberWe at first took them to be Indians on foot but we soon found them to be mountedwhite men and we then thought they were troops. They came down uponus with all speed and we stood ready with our arms in hand to meetthem; but when they came to our great surprise we found them to bethe police from Winter Quarters led by Brother Hosea Stout. They informed us that 16 of them had come from Winter Quarters thinkingwe might need some help. The remainder of the party had stoped withour main camp.We halted our teams returned with them toour camping ground and prepared the brethren breakfast from our fatBuffalo and they regaled us with information of our wives and familiesWe reached the Camp at 8 o'clock in the evening and had a pleasantinterview with the rest of our brethren from Winter Quarters[Circled Text] insert day before [End Circled Text]Winter Quarters ReachedSunday October 31st 1847We all got over breakfast and organized for going into Winter QuartersThe company that came out to meet us went in front of our encampmentIt was a hard day's drive as our horses were worn down and 30miles were before us.When within about one mile of WinterQuarters a halt was made and the company was drawn up inorder and addressed by President Young ^who dismissed the Pioneer camp with his blessing^ and then we drove intothe city in order. The streets waere lined with people toshake hands with us as we passed along. Each drove to hisown home. Three days previous to my arrival I hada daughter born to me and I found both mother and child doing well and all cheerful and happy. &c &c &c 
 Winter Quarter's ProsperousOn our arrival at Winter Quarters we found that the brethren there hadas well as ourselves also been greatly blessed and the earth under their cultivationhad brought forth in great abundance. The city was full of hay surroundedwith corn and plenty of vegeatables and buckwheat had grown.The 3rd of November was spent by the Twelve incouncil and brother Jesse C. Little was to be sent East and I wrote 6 lettersto Col. Kane and others to be taken by him. We also heard a letterread from Capt. Dan Jones of Wales who could represent in that landone thousand Saints.During the month of November much importantbusiness and matter came before the Twelve and on the last of themonth the subject came up concerning appointing three of the Quorum of the Twelve as the First Presidency. Brother Brigham Young saidthat by pursuing this course it would liberate the quorum of the Twelveto go to the nations of the earth.On the 3rd of December we met in conferencewith the Saints on the East side of the river. Elder Appleby arrivedin our midst from Philadelphia spent the evening with us and gaveus much information concerning the nation the wars &c. He broughtas a present from Col. Kane a card of gold pens one for each of theTwelve.The conference next day was adjourned for threeweeks after having resolved to immediately build a large log tabernaclefor the people to meet in. Henry Miller was appointed the committee and about 200 gave their names to go at once to workIt was to be about 65 by 40 feet in the cleer and the building wasto be under the direction of the Twelve.Next day was an important one in the historyof the Church. We rode to Elder Hyde's had a good feast andwent into council and determined the following important matter: 
 Brigham Young Appointed PresidentofThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsSunday Dec. 5th 1847.Brother Brigham Young In This Council of the Quorum of theTwelve Appostles of the Church brother Brigham Young its Presidentexpressed his mind concerning the organization of the Church and theappointing of a First Presidency. He wished all of the quorumpresent to express their feelings and views upon the subject beginningwith the oldest and we did in the following order:Heber C. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson PrattWillard Richards Wilford Woodruff George A Smith A Lymanand E. T. Benson; and then President Young followed.After this Orson Hyde moved that BrighamYoung be President of the Church of Jesus Crist of Latter-day Saintsand that he nominate his two councillors to form the FirstPresidency. Wilford Woodruff seconded it and the motion wascarried by the unanimous vote of the quorum of the Twelve ApostlesPresident Young then nominated HeberC. Kimball as his First Councillor which was seconded byand carried unanimously. President Young then nominatedWillard Richards as his Second Councillor which was seconded byand carried unanimously.Father John SmithAppointed First Patriarchof the ChurchDec. 6th 1847The day after choosing the First Presidency the Twelve commenced 
 in council and Father John Smith was appointed by them the First Patriarchover the whole Church.Remarks upon several subjects were made by PresidentYoung among which were the following items:Our children in this life do not look just like their parents butthey have a variety of looks. The offspring of celestial beings have spiritualbodies.He also said that the Twelve were at liberty to publishpapers in any part of the world where they should be or to take the bestcourse to spread the work. The Twelve should superintend the printingwherever they where and if they were going abroad it will be well forthem to ordain Elders out of new members and take them to preachand there should only one of the Apostles go to one place and call theSeventies to their assistance.In this same council it was decided that if a manlost his wife he was at liberty to mary again where he pleased andwas justified; and Wm W. Phelps was cut off from the Church foradultery.Log Tabernacle Conferenceheld at Winter QuartersDec. the 24th, 1847.The brethren on the East side of the river had been busily building theirLog Tabernacle designed for this Conference and others which might followhe felt they had done a good work in so short a time and on theday appointed we held this one of the most important conferences ofthe Church.The Conference opened at 10 o'clock this dayaccording to appointment. Orson Pratt opened by prayer and WilfordWoodruff addressed the meeting upon the object of calling theConference and was followed by Orson Pratt upon the same subject.Others also addressed the assembly during the day. 
 The Conference lasted 4 days. On the evening of thesecond day the Twelve met in Council and spoke of appointing the First Presidencyduring this Conference and several men were named to fill up the quorumof the Twelve but it was not decided who should fill up that quorum.The First Presidency Chosen By the ChurchIn General Conference at Winter QuartersDec. the 27, 1847.On the last and most important day of the Conference about 1000souls were assembled in the Log Tabernacle.Heber C. Kimball addressed the meeting inthe morning in the power of God and then the names of the Seventywere called over and President Young remarked that it would not benecessary to put them to the meeting or to organized them into quorumswhile here but to remain in a body under their Presidents until they arrived at the Valley.He said that any quorum of the Seventiesor the Twelve though scattered to the four corners of the earth and notfilled up in Zion yet as quorums would be full but when there wasa vacancy by death or apostacy then the vacancy might be filled.From President Youngs teachings we learnedthat it was necessary to keep up a full organization of the Church throughall time as far as could be: at least the First Presidency Quorum ofthe Twelve Seventies and Patriarch over the whole Church.It was then moved byand seconded by and carried unanimously by thebody of the Church in Conference at Winter Quarters that Brigham Youngbe the President of the whole Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints.President Young then nominated Heber C.Kimball to be his First Councillor which was seconded byand carried unanimously. 
 President Young afterwards nominated Willard Richards as hisSecond Councillor which was seconded by andcarried by a unanimous vote.It was then moved by andseconded by that President John Smith be the Patriarchover the whole Church.Much important and interesting instruction was givenupon these and other subjects among which President Young spoke upon theresurrection. He said there was nothing more to be learned by the peopleupon the subject than what was written. It was made plain inthe Bible and other revelations and it was not a subject we wanted touse at the present time as we had not come to the resurrection. Therewas no person except a resurrected being who held the keys of the resurrectionMichael the Arch-angel or Ancient of Days who was Father Adam holdsthe keys of the Resurrection.The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock onthe 6th day of April 1848.On the last day of the year I had an interviewwith President Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects amongwhich was that of my going East on a mission.Sypnosis of 1847The Twelve Apostles with their brethren 143 volunteers asPioneers had made a journey of more than one thousand miles to the RockyMountains and sought out a place for a city and a stake of Zionthat the Saints might have a place to flee to while the indignationof the Law pass over the nation that had driven them out. Wehad returned to Winter Quarters and with all our exposures sicknessand danger not a human life had been lost but all returned insafety. The blessing of the Lord had been great upon 
 us as a people during this year in all the various portions of the Campof Israel and throughout the whole earth. While the past yearhad also shown the fulfilment of prophecy in wars rumours of warsand the many gathering signs of the times. The United States hadbeen engaged in war with Mexico involving themselves in a debtof one hundred and fifty millions of dollars and a loss of twenty fivethousand men on their side and double that on the Mexican sidefamine had raged in Ireland cholera through Europe and a newera opened in the history of the Jews by the election of BaronRothschild to the British Parliament and a prevailing spirit forthe gathering home to Jerusalem.During this year I traveled 2619 miles mostlyin our Pioneer journey to and from the Great Bason or Great SaltLake City.I attended with the Twelve 56 Councils.With the High Council 15.I preached 33 times to the Saints blessed 12 childrenadministered to 30 sick persons wrote 14 letters and received 6.Baptisms Confirmations & OrdinationsI baptized 3; confirmed 122; ordained 1 Bishopand one number of the Seventies. 
 During the first three months of the year 1848the affairs of the Church and temporal arrangements of the peopleat Winter Quarters were filled in with about the usual amount ofordinary business and events with here and there an incident worthyof historical note but not sufficient to afford a constant thread ofnarative as did our Pioneer Journey.From January the 16 to the end ofthe 20, meetings were held by the Twelve at the Log Tabernacleon the East side of the river. We crossed on the ice to visitthe Saints.Two petitions were presented to the meetingsfor signatures one for a county in Potawattame tract of landin Iowa and the other for a Past Office. Brother Miller and otherswere appointed to go to the Legislature of the State of Iowaas delegates to lay before it the pettition of the people ofWinter Quarters for a county. 
 In Council on the 25th Almon Babbit HyrumKimball and John Snider from Nauvoo made a report of affairsin that City and received some counsel from President Youngwho said he did not wish the Temple there Nauvoo to be soldand a number of other matters came up.On the 3rd of Feb. those who were in thebattle of Nauvoo held a feast to commemorate the event. PresidentYoung ^Kimball^ addressed the company upon the subject of the battleand was followed by Col Johnson after which there were feastingsinging instrumental music and dancing.In the battle it appeared from what wasstated there were only 100 Mormons against 900 to a 1000of the mob. There were only three of the brethren killedand one or two slightly wounded while there were several waggonloads of the mob killed and many wounded and the enemy drivenfrom the field. The brethren wore a red badge on theleft arm to distinguishe them from their enemies enemies.They wore the same red badge to day at the feast.Orson Hyde returned from the East inthe middle of the month. We also heard of the welfareand success of the mission of Cap. Dan Jones in Wales in spiteof the fact that nearly the whole of that country was stirred upagainst him.I was 41 years of age on the 1stMarch.On the night of the 5th I hadAn Interesting Dream.It was one of the most interesting I ever dreamt but most ofit was taken from me when I awoke.I flew through the air from state tostate and escaped from the hand of my enemies. I went to 
 Heaven and saw the Saints in their estate and employment. I saw Joseph andHyrum Smith and many others of the Latter-day Saints who have died.The innumberable company of Saints which I saw seemed to be preparingfor some grand and important event which I could not understand. Manywere engaged in making crowns for the Saints. One crown did notsuit the artist so he cut it in the middle to remake it. The Saintswere all dressed in white robes both male and female.On the 18th ^22nd^ of March my son Wilford Woodruffwas eight years of age and he wished to be baptized: so according to theorder of the Church to baptize children at that age I in company withhis mother and sisters and brother John Benbow went to the water andBaptized My Son Wilford Woodruff Jun.March the 18th ^22nd^ 1848We returned home and he was Confirmed By myself andJohn Benbow.On the 21st a large mail was received from theEast. I had a letter from Orson Spencer giving account of the Churchin Europe over which he Presided. The papers brought the stateof affairs of the United States. Among the members of Companydead was John Quincy Adams aged 81 years. He died in his seatin the house of Congress. His father John Adams andThomas Jefferson both Presidents of the United States both died onthe same day the 4th of July in the fiftieth year of the Independenceof the United States and now John Quincy Adams had died onthe birth day of Washington.On the 27th Brigham Young H. C. KimballWilford Woodruff and others crossed the river and met at the LogTabernacle ^with^ Orson Hyde George A. Smith and a number besidesand we went into Council concerning the the organization ofthe Pottawattame County. Documents were read fromseveral members of Iowa to the inhabitants of this County and 
 concerning politics and other matters. Speeches were made pro andcon. and finally answers were given to the effect that we feltdisposed to let politics take their own course and find their ownlevel.On the following Sunday our city wasvisited with a strong gale of wind and a hay stack was burneddown on the outskirts of the place and had it been in the citythe wind probably would have blown the fire and endangeredthe whole city.Next day we were in Council withseveral of the Pawnee chiefs who asked for about ^a^ hundred bushelsof corn for their families who were starving. There were aboutone hundred of the Pawnees in the City and we loaded theirmules with corn and let them go home.Nex On the 4th of April I baptizeda number among whom was Samuel H.

Rockwood Benjamin Clapp and JedediahM. Grant as Presidents of the Seventies; and then Father JohnSmith as the Patriarch of the whole Church.President Young made some remarks concerningappointing the First Presidency. He said, "the Spirit of theLord has been with us and we know what is right. It would havebeen our right to have appointed the Presidency the first Conferencewe held after Joseph's death but it was not wisdom to do it.We have now whipped all our enemies with one hand tiedbehind us and now it is time to organize the Church."In speaking upon principle he said thatan honest man would not be dishonest neither would he followsuch men as Rigdon & Strang. The Sheep would follow suchas God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men wouldfollow the wolves. The Lord will rule in his KingdomI know how things have been and are and will be:"Some suppose that by appointing aPresidency it is robbing some of the rising generation or takingaway some one's rights but it is not so."Concerning persecution I will say that theLord will cause the wrath of men to praise Him. The remainderwill the Lord restrain."

A. Smithand all people: and the High Council."Will you hear it. Then let your paper aloneand keep pen off from it and it will save you much trouble.The inocent will suffer by it. Send no man into Missourifor crime but to Iowa as we are in that State."He also expressed his feelings very plainlyagainst being taken prisoner at any time while he was inocent 
 Teams were again called for and President Kimball spokeupon the subject. Remarks were also made concerning the wives of theBatallion staying at Winter Quarters on this season. It was thought thesoldiers would have to come back for their bounty money and if so that theywould wish to find their families here.President Young said that he was under thenecessity and obligation to do all he could for the soldiers families andand that what he had was at their command. "And now what I wantto know is" he said "Will the Church take this responsibility from offmy sholders and let me go free?" All said "Yes."A committee of five were appointed to locate thepoor the widows and others needing care.

They were ofthe Mormon Batallion had spent two months in the Valleyand had brought a large packet of letters for us. They leftthe last of January.The mildness of the Winter this year in 
 the Valley had been very remarkable and Providential to the Saints whohad arrived only just before its approach. The most of the Winterwas in November and December and broke in the middle ofJanuary. When they left onto ^at^ the end of that month grasswas three inches high and the horses mules and sheep were fatand the Saints had put in 1500 acres of wheat and calculatedto do double that amount. Everything seemed prosperous. Therehad been 10 deaths in all the Camp and many births. Myfather had been quite sick but was well again.A Blessing Given to My WifeApril the 13thDuring the evening of this day President Young and ladyand George A Smith and John Benbow called upon me andspent two or three hours with us very pleasantly. Mrs Woodruffasked a blessing under ^at^ the hand of President Young.

As thou artgoing forth with they husband into the vineyard the blessingof the Lord will go with thee. Thou shalt have power andwisdom to teach the truth to thy friends and thy sex.

 A Brother Shot.On the 15th I went over the river to Log Tabernacle withGeorge A Smith and on our way learned that there was  much excitementat the Point. The inhabitants had laid off Council Point intoa town or town lots. One line fence ran through John Geenshouse and the people pulled down his fence to move it. He wentand put it up and took his rifle and swore he would kill the firstman who crossed the line of his fence or offered to touch it.While the company stood looking at himBrother Condit a shoemaker came out of his shop and walked up tosee what was going on and in doing so walked over the line andJohn Geen shot him through the heart and he fell dead. A Frenchmanthen struck Geen across the head and he fell as if he was killedbut he came to. They buried the dead brother and took hismurderer to Iowa city to be tried for his crime.

Our Valleynews informed us that the Saints had sowed 800 acres of wheat andhad inclosed 5000 acres of land within pale fences.The Otoe Chiefs with many of theirtribe paid a visit to Winter Quarters on the 8th. They hadbehaved themselves much more honourable towards us thanthe Omahas.All was bustle at Winter Quarters twodays later for a steamer had arrived and brought us flour groc[e]riesfreight and baggage. On the return of the boat the same dayseveral took passage in her among whom were Orson Pratt andfamily bound for England.President Young addressed the people onSunday the 14th and among many interesting remarks he saidhe felt to bless the Saints who go on to the Valley or tarry atWinter Quarters. He blessed the Potawattame land andalso said that the Saints never would be driven from theMountains except by insurrection among ourselves and he had no fears of that.On the 2th ^20th^ about 150 passengers 
 mostly Saints from England arrived per steamboat. Among them were EldersFranklin and Samuel Richards. They brought with them the body of ElderSarine who had been dead some 12 days.Next day I rode five miles out with PresidentYoung to the Camp bound for Great Salt Lake City. There were aboutthree hundred waggons in the encampment.At this date and during the two or three weeksbefore and later the brethren at Winter Quarters were very active inpreparing and organizing for their journey to the Mountain and somefor their missions East and to Europe.On the 24th President Young went out to theHorn to organize the Camp and next day I took the parting hand ofBrother Brigham and let him have 25 dollars to help him buy ayoke of cattle. On the following day I moved my familyand effects over the river and stoped near the ferry.In company with Orson Hyde E. T. Bensonand others on the 2nd of June I rode out to the Horn to see PresidentsYoung and Kimball and the Camp of Israel. We found onour arrival that all had crossed the Horn and that LorenzoSnow and Zera Pulsipher captains of Hundreds had goneon their journey with their Hundred each.There were about 600 waggons in all thathad crossed the Horn. They had made a noble looking encampmentand a beautiful sight. There had been 4 burials here 2infants and one aged woman and Brother Neff had a son ^named Charles^ 8 years ofage drowned at the Horn. His name wasI spent a little time with President Youngwent through the encampment visited my acquaintences and wrotea letter to brother John Benbow who had gone on in the foremostcompanies.Next day we took the parting hand ofPresidents Young and Kimball and many of the Saints recrossedthe Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. 
 Some days later I crossed the river to see President Richardsand to talk over the subject of his situation. He was lying sick andhad been for many months and Presidents Young and Kimballhad to go on with their companies and leave him behind. Besideshe had not means to go with and I was waiting to see if I couldnot assist him in some way.On the 14th I rode to George A Smithstook him in my carriage rode to the Ferry dined with BrotherBenson and again crossed the river to see President Richards.Just as we landed the blowing of thebugle the rush to arms and report that Indians were comingupon the people created quite an excitement. About 80 men assembledbut they were in a poor state to resist an attack. No Indianshowever came; and the people were addressed by AmasaLyman George A. Smith and myself upon the necessity of beingwell armed and prepared for Indian attacks while in an Indiancountry. The men were required to met every night at sun-setfor drill.The night previous to this the Omahascame upon some Pawnees who were in the town and firedarrows upon them which they returned with powder and ballbut none were killed.On the Sunday I rode with myfamily to the Tabernacle and President Richards laid hiscurcumstances before the meeting. George A. Smith W. Woodruffand O. Hyde urged the subject of our assisting President Richardswith waggons oxen &c to follow on to the Mountains and acommittee was appointed to go and obtain means for this purpose.At the close of meeting I took the partinghand with many of the Saints. Brother Richards blessedme and said that the power of God should rest upon me on thismission and that no power should prevail against me. Manyblessings he pronounced on my head. 
 Starting On My MissionJune the 21st 1848On this day I started on my mission East. Our companyconsisted of myself and family and Dominicas Carter with my carriageBrother Russel Homer had a waggon and carried with him Libeas T. CoonesJohn Mc Murry and David M. Gammit. The whole of us were elevensouls in our company.On the 6th day of our journey at the close ofa heavy thunder storm Elders Hyde and Johnson and other drove updrenched with rain.Next day we reached Mount Pisgah and at nightheld a meeting at that place which was addressed by Orson Hydeand Wilford Woodruff, both constrained by the Spirit of God to speakin much plainness to the people.On the following day I had an interview withAaron York President of the Branch who laid before me the state ofaffairs concerning himself and the Church at Mount Pisgah.In the afternoon we held meeting. I addressedthe people and gave them counsel. Bro York followed and withdrewfrom the Presidency of the Branch and we then appointed by thevoice of the people Edwin Whiting for President with brothersWhiting and Demill for his counsellors.We left Mount Pisgah on the 29thof June and continued our journey.On the 5th of July we spent the afternoon andnight with Brother James Williams after our drive of 15 milesin the morning.During the evening a hard thunderstormwas approaching us. My mules were tied to a large oak onthe opposite side of the street and I felt impressed to move themaway to another place and I did so. I also removed my 
 children out of the carriage and made them a bed in the house ^correct it by copy whereMrs Woodruff and myself slept.We had just retired to bed when the stormreached us with great fury and in a moment the large oak tree camethundering to the ground with a terrific crash. Had I not havemoved my mules it probably would have killed them; had I not havemoved my carriage it would have crushed it to atoms and killed us forthe body of the tree fell where my carriage stood. It justmissed brother Kingsleys waggon. I consider my impressionsan interposition of Providence to save our lives.NauvooOn Sunday the 9th in company with brothers Dana and Kingsley I drove into Montrose dined with Bro Beebe andthen crossed the river on the steam ferry boat to Nauvoo.We called upon Almon W Babbit andthen in company with John Snider I visited the Temple and wentover it from the bottom to the top. Here I once more hada full view of the once beautiful but now desolate city Nauvoo.The Temple was in a much better state ofpreservation than I expected to find it.The people in the city of Nauvoo weremuch excited from a report that Elder Hyde would preach in theTemple that day. They had made many threats upon thesubject and some came in waggons from the country to hear andsee; but the excitement was all among themselves for ElderHyde had given out no such appointment.I returned to Almon W. Babbits andfound a man had come from Michigan to enquire afterthe Gospel and to see the Saints. I was introduced to himand he told his business. I preached the Gospel to himone hour and then went to the river in Nauvoo and baptized him. 
 Afterwards we returned to brother John Snider's in the house built by George A. Smithand here I confirmed him and ordained him an Elder gave him a licence to preachand he went his way rejoicing.Next day I called upon Elder Babbit spent themorning with him and bought of him six volumes of the Times and SeasonsI then went to Hyrum Kimball's and dined with him and visited hisgarden which was the finest in the Western country.I sold my mules carriage and harness to SamuelBeverly for 160 dollars and buffalo robe for 3 dollars and 70 cents and tookpassage for Keokuck on the 11th and in the evening from thence tookpassage on board the Lucy Bertram for St. Louis where we arrivedthe next day.On Sunday I met with the St Louis Branch of the Churchover which N. H. Felt presided. There was a large congregationpresent and Orson Hyde addressed them ^upon the subject of the resurrection^ in the morning and I spoketo them in the afternoon.I spent the Monday in St. Louis and in theevening took cabin passage with my family on board the Herald andarrived at Lasselle two days later.From thence next day I hired a manto carry myself and family to brother Luther Scammans 21/2 milesNorth of Lost Grove in Lamoile Bureau Co. Illinois. We foundhim and ^our sister my wife's sister^ Rhoda and their family all well but our little daughterwho had been sick for some days was suffering much through thejourney and grew worse. Two days afterwards she died.Shuah Woodruff was bornOctober the 28th 1847 andDied July the 22nd 1848Aged 8 months and 25 daysOn Sunday the 23 of July we buried her in the garden of ^our^ brother ^in law^Luther Scamman's a few rods South of his dwelling. She wasburied in a good black wallnut coffin set inside of an Ash box.I put up a lime stone slab at the grave with the following 
 inscription well carved upon it with my own hand:S. C. Woodruff Died July 22nd 1848 aged 9 months.The children born to us up to this time wereSarah Emma born July 14th 1838 Died July 17th 1840 aged2 years and three days.Wilford Jr born March 22nd 1840.Phebe Amelia born March 4th 1842.Susan Cornelia born July 25th 1843.Joseph born in Liverpool England July 1845; DiedNovember 11th 1846 aged 1 year and 4 months.Ezra Carter born Dec 9th 1846; Died Dec 11th 1846 agedtwo days.Shuah Carter born Oct. 28th 1847; Died July 22nd 1848 aged 8 m. 25 days.The loss of our children ^much^ affected Mrs Woodruff and she refusedto be comforted because they were taken away.While we were staying at Luther Scammans hehad 18 acres of wheat which he wanted stacked. So herigged two teams and I took them into the field and duringthe day I hitched on to the waggons the wheat which grewupon 12 acres of ground and a young man loaded it for me andbrothers Scamman and Carter put it into stacks as fast aswe brought it in. Good judges said it would yeild [yield] 25waggons in one day 300 bushels of wheat making 3600 bundles.It was a very hot day and I was not in good health. It wasas much as a well man ought to have done in two days andit was imprudent in me as I had done no hard work for somemonths. At night I was sore from the crown of my^head^ to the soles of my feet.On the 31st I left brother Scammansand arrived at Chicago on the 2nd of August and continued nextday and reached Buffalo on the 7th.

Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.My dear Brother: Just a word of advise: Senator Cannon often comesto New York and is willing and kind enough to speak at our Sunday services. The question is, will it be right for me to put an add in the paper, stating that the Senator will speak and also to publish a synopsis of his sermon. I am expecting to hold a con-ference here in Greater New York in a few weeks and the Senatorhas consented to come up and speak^,^ on one condition^,^ and i, e., that you will have no objection to me advertizing that the senator will preach.I understand th^a^t Senator Cannon is doing some confiden-tial business for you and I would not wish to do anything that would hinder or interfer with your business in any way. Brother Cannon was with us last Sunday and the Sunday before here at our services and we enjoyed his talk very much and I believe he can do some good for the meritorious cause in which we are engaged.We have plenty of work for go^o^d inteligent young men who are humble and well equiped with a knowledge of the gospel.We have some good singers with us from "Zion" and our servicesare quite interisting and attractive. We have a few very nice recent converts and expect to batpize two more next Sunday.Praying God to bless you, I remain, with love,Your brother, A. P. Kesler.

 enough, and the Lord did notrequire me to suffer any more.I never received the house, or anything, for I suppose he forgotall about me, having more importantBusiness to attend to. My house is Built of inch Lumber, and very coldin Winter & hot in summer.I have not lived in a house thatwas plastered in any part; sinceI came to the mountains, but that does not matter much, asI am used to hardships of allkinds. I have never called on theChurch for aid; until, the longsickness, and Death of Mr Lightneraccompanied by a series of misfortunescompelled me to apply to BrotherTaylor for assistance. Just beforemy Husband died, Brother Taylorallowed me two hundred Dollarsa year during his life time, butintimated that he would incre^ase^the amount at his deathâ€”he diedtwo years agoâ€”and left me in debt over a hundred Dollarsâ€”a Jewhas my note for $8000 Eighty Dollarsand I have not a Dollar to pay on itâ€”the rest of the debt is paid. I have not received a centsince Brothers ^Taylors^ death. I haveAunt Gilbert to support, who; is now in her Eighty-Eighth year of herage, and a cripple. I borrowedmoney to come up, hoping to see you, I find my only alternative is to pen these lines to you, hoping theLord will direct you in this matterI was sealed to Brother ^Josephs^ familyin the Spring of 1831. And whenZions Camp went to Missouri, he received a Commandmentto take me for a wifeâ€”But was afraidâ€”and I was not sealedto him as a wife, until 1841â€” 
 I cincerely hope you will notpass this request by, for I assureyou; that unles I am assisted, I must suffer for both food, and clothing for the coming Winter.Please answer this letter as soonas convenient.

 taken very sick on the road with a species ofâ€”After a long and tedious journey with my family of2595 miles from Council Bluffs to Boston by land and waggons rivers lakescanals railroads &c we arrived at the city of Boston on the 12th of Augustwhere I found Elders Felt and Robins and in a few days also met here EldersO. P. Rockwood and Jesse C Little.Here I tarried until the 26 holding meetings associatingwith the Saints gathering up the exciting news of the world writing letters &directing the affairs of the Church and then went to Bradford with ElderLeonard Hardy.On the Sunday we held meetings with the Saintsat the Samuel B Hardy's at East Bradford and while at this placeI spent a few hours with Milton Holmes who was quite gloomyfeeling unhappy and knowing not what course to take.I rode to Lowell on the 29th and visitedthe Iron Foundries &c; and in the evening met with the few Saintsat that place.Next day I parted with Bro Hardy he forPeterborough and I for Boston to my family. Here I tarried withthe Saints until the 4th of September and held meetings on the Sundaywith Elders A. Corden Lewis Robins and N. H. Felt present.On the 4th I and my family left Bostonin the express train for Portland. Through some misunderstandingthe two trains waited for each other 3 or 4 hours so we didnot get into Portland till 1 o'clock at night. We found ourbrother Ilus F. Carter waiting for us and he took us home andwe spent with him the night.Next day we called upon our brotherEzra Carter and family and ascertained that Father Carter hadbeen in the day before to carry us out home with him but notfinding us he went away quite disapointed. So Mrs Woodruffthought it best to go out to her fathers house to see her agedfather once more and she took stage and went out and spent 
 the night with him. He was quite out of health but got well almostimmediately as soon as he saw her. He was 76 years of age anda visit from his daughter Phebe was like as from one rose from thedeadI left Portland with my children next day and rodeto Scarborough to Father Carters and was glad to once more seehim and sister Foss and their familiesOn the afternoon of the 12th FatherCarter, G B. ^Ira Carter^ Foss Rhoda Foss and myself and Mrs Woodruffleft Scarborough to visit Freedom Moulton and family at Wiltonwhich we reached on the second day having left however sisterRhoda on the way.Here Sarah B Foss Phebe Woodruffand Shuah C. Moulton all our sisters had the privelege ofmeeting once more together. It had been 8 years since theyhad met before. It was a happy family union.Freedom Moulton had a good form of 100 acresand had taught school 120 months. He and his wife MrsWoodruff's sister treated us kindly during our visit. We partedfrom them on the 19th and reached Scarborough on thesecond day.The day after our return we had a familymeeting in the evening at Father Carter's. Our father waspresent also our brother Joseph Fabyan Carter. We had a goodtime. I expressed my feelings in plainess concerning mycourse and the dealings of the Lord with and and Phebe did thesame and said that her parents and friends would know in eternitywhy she had taken the course she had in leaving her father'shouse and following the Saints. The Spirit of the Lordwas with us. Brother Fabyan Carter spoke for a fewminutes and Father Carter said he was satisfied with us andif there was a society of Saints where he could spend the fewremaining days of his life which he had to spend on Earth 
 he should be glad to. It was an interesting time to us all.On the 23 Mrs Woodruff and Mrs Foss carried me in awaggon to Saco and I then left them and took the cars with brother D. Carterfor Boston where I spent a few days in the performance of my ministeralduties among the Saints.On the 27th I was at Worcester. There wasa cattle show there on that day; and here were some of the finest oxenI ever saw in my life. I saw one large ox that girted 10 feetand weighed alive 4200 pounds; two Durham oxen which were two ofthree twins calved at a time 2200 lbs each; a mamouth Durham cowgirt 8 feet, weight 2500 lbs; and other remarkable specimens in thecattle line.In the evening I took the cars to NorthbridgeWe were loaded down alomst to suffocation and the cars croweded out onthe platforms until the people were in danger of falling off.I stayed with the Saints at Northbridgeover the next day and returned to Worcester. Here I visited theinsane hospital which contained about 500 occupants. Their appartmentswere neat clean and comfortable. Bro ^Jess^ Haven went throughthe Asylum with me.I arrived at New York on the 30th andon Sunday the 1st of October met with the Saints there, andpreached to them. The Presiding Elder was gone and I recommendedBro T. Cartwright for that position and we appointed him and I ordained him to the office of an Elder. The records representedat this time 65 members in the New York BranchI spent several days with the Saints ofNew York visiting them &c and then left for Philadelphia onthe 4th.Next day I called upon Col. Kane clerk of the United States Court. There were many persons inhis office yet as soon as he saw me he laid aside allother business and came and grasped my hand and seemed 
 much delighted to see me. He talked with me about 15 minutes about upona variety of subjects and I then retired from his office.There was quite a display to day the 5thin Philadelphia in depositing the remains of Comodore James Biddlein the vault of the Biddle family. This was done with militaryhonours. There were about 20 military companies and threebands of music accompanied with a dislay of flags frompublic buildings chiming of bells firing of minute guns fromthe navy yard &c. Commodore Biddly is the eleventh Commodore buried in Philadelphia up to this date and the8th or ninth who had died there. Those preceding himwere Commodores Decatur Bainbridge Barry Truston ShawHull Rodgers Porter Elliot and Dallast.Two days later Elder W. J. Applebyand myself again called upon Col Kane. His office was fullof business men but as as soon as he saw me he came directlyas cordially as before and conversed with us with deep interest uponour cause. He said he had fears that there was troublebrewing against us in the West of Iowa and he wished me togive him the earliest information of anything against us.On the Sunday I met the Saintswith many strangers in the old Mormon Hall or MarshallHall. I addressed them in the morning from the wordsof Jesus to his disciples that "as it was in the days of Noahand Lot so also should it be in coming of the Son of Man. [##Matthew 24:37##] Ihad the power of God with me during the day.I gave Brother Appleby a recommendto preach and organzie Churches in Pa. N. J. and Delaware inmy absence.On the 10th I parted with the Saints inPhiladelphia and rode by rail to Newmark and the next dayheld a meeting at the house of brother Provost and organized abranch of the Church called the Newmark and Spring Garden 
 Branch and appointed brother John Sanderson of Roway the Presiding Elderover the Branch at this place.During the following days to the 18th I visitedNew York Brooklin Hempstead and Northwalk Newark ^Norwalk^ Ct. being at New York andBrooklin several times in the interval.The following is an extract of a letter written byme to my wife on the 18th:"I have been much blessed with the Spirit ofGod since I saw you. I have felt more of the presence and power ofGod with me than I expected to have enjoyed on this Eastern missionI have felt that some one has prayed much for me of late. I wonderif it was Phebe? I know you pray much for me. I feel its powerand prize it much. I have never felt such a desire to prove worthyof your confidence and trust, shun every appearance of evil keep outof the path of all temptation and do right in all things as I haveof late."I have had much of the spirit of secret prayer,have poured out my soul in supplication before God with tears of joywhile the visions of my mind have been open at times to seeclearly my duty to my God, to my wife and children, to theSaints and the world at large."I have also seen the awful and certainjudgements of God which like a gathering storm are ready to burstupon the whole Gentile world, especially this nation who haveheard the sound of the Gospel rejected it with all the testimonyof the servants of God stoned and killed the Prophets becomedrunk with the blood of martyrs and Saints and at last driventhe entire Church with the Priesthood and keys of Eternal lifeout of their midst into the Wilderness and Mountains of IsraelBy so doing they have turned the last key which seals theircondemnation which lingereth not and their damnation whichslumbereth not: therefore they cannot escape. Not onlythe Holy Ghost but that portion of the Spirit of God that 
 enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, which like a faithfulambassador who has finished his work, is rapidly takings it flight fromGentile America and Wo! Wo! Wo is their doom".I was at New Haven on the 21st. I called at Mr S. Turtles and found Sister Turtle sick. She was asyellow as saffern. A number of comforters like thosethose who came to Job [##Job 2:11##] called upon her and reproached herbecause she was sick inasmuch as she professed to believein God and asked why she did not call upon her Eldersto heal her. This was done to reproach her and she spokeout and said, "O that the Lord would send brother Woodruff here."This was but a few moments before she received a note fromme stating that I was coming and when I laid hands uponher she was healed indeed and I felt to praise the Lord.Next day was Sunday and I metwith the Saints at Father Jairus Sandford and among otherspresent was Mr Smith Turtle and his wife who was healed theday before. Soon after she left home her daughter cameto the house to take care of her supposing her to be very lowbut found she had gone to meeting. I preached twiceduring the day with the Spirit and power of God and inthe afternoon administered the SacramentBefore I left this place I felt stronglyimpressed by the Spirit of the Lord to ordain Elder JuriusSandford to the office of High Priest and Patriarch which I didon the 23rd of Oct 1848 he being 85 years of age 10 monthsand 2 days old. He had done much good to the ChurchHe paid into the hands of Elder Sarine $267 dollars forhis tithing 163 for Sarine's own use and in all had given700 dollars for tithing and the assistance of the Saints andthe Elders. I felt the old Patriarch rejoicing inGod; and then started on the 24th to North Haven roderound with Orrin Mansfield of that place to see the Saints 
 held meeting with them and advised them to keep up their organization of thebranch and hold meetings.A Great Day at BostonOct 25 1848I took the rail at North Haven and arrived in Boston at 12 o'clockand got into an Omnibus to go to Cambridgeport but was blocked upby the great procession marching through the city in celebration of theintroduction of the water from the Long Pond into the city of Boston.This procession was two hours and 30 minutespassing any given point and was considered the grandest display evermade on any occassion in an American city and there was supposedto be more people in Boston than ever known before. The processionitself was said to be 7 miles long. Archways were formed acrossthe streets decked with evergreens and flowers and a pyramadeof evergreen and flowers overtop bearing a great variety of mottos.The procession started from the Common15 minutes past 12 at noon. First came a powerful band ofLancers. Then followed 30 military companies in full uniformand several other bands of music. Next came the fire companiesof the city with their engines ornamented with wreathes flowers &c;following were the fire companies from the neighboring townsAfter these came a cavalcade of 500 gentlemen and a few ladiesA boy's fire engine drawn by two ponies was followed bytwo of the largest size water pipes mounted on a platformdrawn by seven black horses bearing the inscriptions: "Firstpipe laid April 19th 1847": "Water introduced into the city Oct 251848."After this came a brick layers platformwith impliments of their trade followed by a host of workmen.Next were the Boston Boat Clubs with their boats and afterthese the Boston Port society with a ship fully rigged and 
 manned under the command of Father Taylor: theSalem East IndianMarine and the old Marine societies followed bearing in their ranksthe old Palanquin which had not been seen in public for 40 yearsThis was borne by 6 stout Negroes. In a carriage drawn by4 horses was a large full rigged moddle of the famous but unfortunateprivateer the Grand Turk. Other carriages followed containingspecimens of American clocks goods carpeting &c.After these came Oak Hall expressesAdams & Mrs Ridders. A printing office passed onwheels with workmen all at work strewing papers cards &c amongthe mass as they proceded onwards followed by Faneuil Hallmarket in minature with a grand display of beef mutton porkfowles fish vegitables &c which I presume was a temptationto the hungry crowded lookers on. The market men came nextin great force with badges on their hats.A stuffed Elephant passed mounted upona carriage with 3 persons riding on his back; also an artificalflower manufactory drawn by 6 horses containing 12 young girlsdressed in white all busy making flowers. There was anapple tree filled with fruit with Adam and Eve picking it andthe serpant on the tree. All the Masonic and Odd Fellow'ssocieties of Boston were in the procession and hundreds of flagsmaking a costly array were brorne [borne] onwards.The first Division of the Procession wasunder the direction of the honourable John C. Park and consistedof the Mayor of Boston Committee of Arrangements; Water CommitteeWater Commisioners & Engineers, Aldermen, President of theCommon Council, Members of the Common Council, HighSheriffs of the State; the Governor and suite &c, &c, escortedby the Boston Cadets and flanked by the city Greys. Afterthese was a long array of civil and military functionaries,representatives of foreign countries bearing the tri colorured flag,the Clergy, Medical Faculty, Editors, Members of the bar 
 Governments of the Neighbouring cities students of Harverd University, MercantileLibrary Association in full array and scores of other companies too numerousto name.All along the route of the Procession the publicbuildings hotels and private residences were crowded with human beingsand the Common was literally covered.At half past 4 o'clock the Government of thecity headed by the chief marshal reached the Common and took their seatson a decorated platform in the centre of the reservoir after which lengthyspeeches were made by the Mayor and Mr Hale. At the closeof the speeches the Mayor arose and said:"Fellow citizens, it is proposed to admit thewaters of Lake Cochituate into the city. All those in favourwill say Aye!"The response was in a voice of thunder. Thesignal was then given and upwards gushed a pure column of water8 inches in diameter 80 feet into the air and falling again intothe reservoir. The cheering of the people at this moment wasoverwhelming. The night was passed with fireworks andilluminations.While beholding these things going on thewords of the Lord came with weight upon my mind which says"Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands flock togetherthere while wisdom shows a narrow path with here and therea traveller," I went to Brother A Badlams and spentthe night.Next day I took train with brother NathanielCorey to New Bedford and read an account of the burning of theTemple of Nauvoo by our enemies.After visiting the Saints at various placesand attending to Church affairs I reached Scarborough again andfound my wife and children at her sister Foss'Here I remained with our friends until 
 the 17th of November when I parted with Father Carter and the rest of ourfamily ^there^ and with my wife and children to ^took^ the rail to Boston and thenceby omnibus to Cambridgeport where I received letters from Orson Prattand others all bearing good news of the progress of the work of theLord in England.I took a house in Cambridgeport for myfamily and continued labouring with the Saints in Boston untilthe 2nd of Dec when I took train and stage to Peterboro whereI found Bro Jesse C. Little and Leonard Hardy; and withthem and the Peterbow Saints I spent the interval to the9th when I rode to Guilson and stayed with Chilon MackSolomon Mack and their Father Capt. Mack came in and spentthe night with me. Capt. Mack and Lucy Smith motherof the Prophet Joseph were brother and sister.Next day was Sunday and I preachedto the few Saints who were in that place and on thefollowing day with Solomon Mack ^rode^ to Bro Waldos andnext day ^the following^ to Walpole Branch where I found difficulties hadexisted for several years.During the 5 following days I wasat Alworth Peterboro and Lowell at which places I preachedand on the 18th of Dec I returned to my family at Cambridgeport.All the papers and news of the daywere full of important and stirring events of the wars andrevolutions in Europe and startling developments ^in America^. Amongthose of America was the discovery of Go[l]d by the Mormonsin upper California and the rush of the nation to thegold field like the rushing of a horse to battle.The cholera had again commenced inNew York yet the gold panic was so much greater thanthe fever of the cholera that it was hardly noticed.Among the letters which I obtained onmy return to my family was one from Orson Hyde who 
 informed me that Oliver Cowdery had come back to the Church hadmade satisfaction and was voted to come in by the door of baptism. Hewas the first man baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints in this last dispensation under the hands of Joseph Smith theProphet and one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of MormonAfter being out of the Church seven years he had now returned again.Ten days more of ministeral labour inBoston and the year 1848 was brought to a close.Sypnosis of 1848During this year of our Lord 1848 the "Fig Tree" hathrapidly put forth her leaves and blosomed for the summer. Itis a year which has laid the foundation for the fulfilment ofmore prophecy and revelation than has been fulfilled in centuriesin other ages. Thrones have been cast down kingdomsoverturned the power of the Pope of Rome broken and he drivenfrom the papal dominion; and All the nations of the earth havebeen convulsed. Revelations wars anarchy and confusion havefollowed each other in rapid succession; cholera plagues andfamine came in the train and last of all though not the leastin importance the foundation is laid for the dissolutionof the American Government. While these things weregoing on a spirit has prevailed for the return of the Jewsand the rebuilding of Jerusalem; some 7000 Latter-day Saintshave gathered into the valley of the Mountains by the GreatSalt Lake and the Saints in the valley of Sacramentohave discovered vast quanties of gold the report of which hasran like electricity through the world and tens of thousandsare flocking to the gold fields of California.The revolutions of Europe commenced withFrance. The people rose en masse and had a three days 
 ^fight^ at the end of which they drove Louis Philipi out of France with all theroyal family. The people entered the T[ourelles] took the throneupon their shoulders carried it into the streets and dashed it to pieceson the ground. They then undertook to establish a Republicangovernment.It was said that in the first 3 days fightthere were only 500 killed; but afterwards a reaction took place witha fight and some 15000 killed. Finally they organized a governmentand at the end of '48 the world was anxiously waiting the election ofa President of the French Republic and prophesying much futurebloodshed before the issue of this revolution was reached.The German States and Prussia nextfollowed in revolution. Austria arose and drove her kingfrom his throne but he afterwards returned with his armiesand bombarded Vienna 8 days and reorganized his kingdomgiving to his people a milder form of government and moretoleration and still his throne was in danger.The Emperior of Russia had also muchwar and his throne was in some uncertainty the Irish hadmade a struggle to throw off the British yoke but failed. Theinhabitants of Rome had risen up in their might and compelled thePope to change after change and at last dashed his power to theearth assassinated his councillors and driven ^him^ from the Papalchair which has stood unshaken for centuries and he has soughtprotection by fleeing to other nations.While this was going on in foreigncountries turn our eyes for a moment to America. She wasa nation blessed above all other nations under heaven yet shehad recently shed the blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchsand Saints and had suffered mob rule to take the placeof Constitution law and order. And what position is hein at the close of this year. One of her States Ohio hasdisgraced herself by her Legislature sitting for weeks in 
 fighting for mastery instead of organizing and doing the business of thepeople; and the leaders of the whole nation herself at Washington hadalso been engaged in ^engendering^ the spirit of party strife hatred disunion and warThey had met in seperate parties laying plans for the disolving of theUnion and the anihilation of the American Government and whilethe Senators and Statesmen of the Slave States have met in conventionand resolved that if slavery in the District of Columbia was abolishedor prohibited in California they would immediately disolve theUnion lay Taxes upon the shipping of the free States &c, the citizenand Statesmen of the free States had also met and had resolved uponthe struggle between North and South unless they could carry theirmeasures.Yet while parties were growing more andmore determined and divided the public mind seemed to be blindedas to the result of these movements and ignorant of the fruit whichwould grow up from the seed of their own sowing. They hadeyes but saw not, ears but hear not, hearts but do not understand." [##Matthew 13:15##]But the servants of God and his Prophets have seen the end withas much certainly as did Noah Lot and Jesus the thingsconcerning Jerusalem Sodom and Gomorrow [Gomorrah] and the antedelivuanworld.During the past year also the Asiaticcholera had marched through the earth had arrived in theStates and was sweeping down its thousands daily.Turning our eye towards Zion on the otherhand the Lord had been favouring for. The Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been organized witha First Presidencyâ€”namely Brigham Young Heber C. Kimballand Willard Richards who had gathered to the Mountains ofIsrael in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake took withthem about 3000 souls some 8000 head of  cattle makingat this date a population of about 7000 Saints in the Cityof the Great Salt Lake; while those of the Brethren who 
 had located near the Bay of San Francisco had discovered mines of wealthin gold and other precious and useful ore which had created an immenseexcitement throughout the world.My Travels in 1848I travelled during this year 4850 milesMeetings & CouncilsI attended with the Twelve Apostles 12 Councilsand I held during the year of public meetings 44I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 ordained tothe office of Patriarch Jurious Sanford aged 88 85 and alsoordained one President of the Seventies.Administrations & BlessingsI administered to 20 sick persons some of whom wereremarkably healed and glorified God and I blessed accordingto the order of the Church 10 children.I wrote 60 Letters and received 39.Thus had been the events and general affairs of the worldof the Church and myself during the year 1848 and theSpirit whispered to me that the year eighteen hundred andforty nine would be a year of calamities and momentto the nations of the earth. 
 On Monday morning the 1st day of the year 1849the Steamer Europia arrived bringing news of the election of PrinceLouis Napoleon as President of the French Republic; also of the abdication of the Emperor of Austria in favour of his youngnephew and of dreadful starvation in Iceland and the ragingof the Cholera in Europe. Tidings also from South Americawas of a similar character. At New Orleans the cholera wasraging to such a frightful extent that the inhabitants werefleeing business suspended captains mates clerks and handsdying off and the steamboats had to stop running.I received a letter brought by brotherGoodridge from brother Josiah G. Hardy wishing me to visit asister who was possessed of an evil spirit so I accompaniedhim to West Newbury 40 miles.I tarried around this neighbourhooduntil the 8th and then returned to Boston to my family.Next day I received letters fromOrson Spencer and Dan Jones from England. Brother Jones 
 expressed his feelings on warm terms concerning my letters to him andsaid he felt encouraged by them to go ahead in the name of the Lord.He informed me that he had raised up a Branch at Myrther of over800 members and the total of members of the Churches raised up byhim in Wales was 2747.The whole representation of the Churches inEngland ^Scotland and Wales^ represented at the General Conference at Manchester Aug 14th1848 amounted to 350 Branches 929 Elders 1185 Priests,608 Teachers 341 Deacons, 17902 members. There hadbeen added since May 31st 1846, 8467 souls to the ChurchOrson Pratt was now the President of the Churches in theBritish Isles.Elder Dan Jones added "I havepublished in the Welsh language 48 different kinds andsize of pamphlets comprising more original matter than theBook of Mormon Doctrines and Covenants and voice ofWarning and have circulated one million eight hundredthousand of pages all of which preach night and day torich and poor the eternal truths of Mormonism andcheer the honest hearted. Many learned and some verynoted men have embraced the work. I have been enabled to subdue my foes many of the gifts of the Spiritare manifest. One young man who had been deaf anddumb 8 years was healed when coming up out of the watersof baptism so he both heard and spake was ordainedto the Priesthood and is now preaching the Gospel withsuccess."Captain Dan Jones was addingto the Churches in Wales 150 per mouth. ElderOrson Spencer also wrote to me many good thingsHe said in his letter to me:"The work is rolling forth inmuch power. I have been of late stiring up the 
 Saints to pay their tithing. I have visited many of the Conferences and feelencouraged to believe I shall gather a good sum for the Temple.The addition to the Churches continue tobe great. The migration falls much short of the increase. Theremay be 1500 Saints emigranted this season but what is that amongso many"The Saints wax very bold and utter theirtestimony with much assurance in the Holy Ghost. It is trulydelightful to see them pushing sectarian churches and demolishinghuman creeds as so much hay and stubble. The weak arebecoming strong and the Gentiles marvel."You would be astonished to see the issue ofbooks stars and tracts from the Star Office. Every fortnightthe issue of Stars has doubled since I took charge in '47 andall other works in equal ration and the tide of truth rollsirresistibily through the land."Some two weeks later Almon W. Babbitcalled upon me and spent the evening and conversed upon a variety ofsubjects. He had been to Washington and had spent a length of timeand called to see me to induce me to go there with him and getan introduction to the members of Congress in case the Church shouldwish me to do any business there another year. He said he hadbeen labouring while there to so arrange the Territorial billsas to have a Territorial government in the Great Bason North Americato be called the Utah Territory embracing 300 miles in lengthHe thought it would be necessary for the inhabitants of Great SaltLake Valley to organize a State government &c. He had gota Post Office established at Salt Lake City and Elder Haywoodappointed Post Master; also had got Post Offices established atGarden Grove & Mount Pisgah. He was very familiar with themembers from Iowa and Illinois and Thomas Benton of Missouricame to him just before he left and shook hands with him familiarlyAfter hearing all Almon Babbit had to say I concluded that he 
 was at work upon his own book and not by the Council of thePresidency of the Church. So I resolved that my health calling and thespirit within me would not permit me to leave the business uponwhich I was sent and go to Washington.On the 24th I received three letters fromGeorge A Smith E. T. Benson and Dominicas Carter from theBluffs and two from the Valley one from A.O. Smoot.The letter from brother Smoot gave anaccount of the affairs in the Valley since his arrival there. Hesaid the organization of the Presidency was received in the Valleyand all business attended to that was necessary and wrote of theravages of the crickets upon the crops &c.George A. Smith and E. T. Benson wrotethat they had organized 50 Branches of the Church at CouncilBluffs and all were doing well. Most of the brethren whowent into the army had returned to their families. They hadbuilt a new Tabernacle in Pottawatomie County. Brother Eganand 12 others had arrived on the 7th of Dec with the latest newsfrom Great Salt Lake. They left on the 13th of October.President Young had arrived at the Valley on the 20 of Septand Heber C. Kimball on the 24th. Charles C. Rich hadbeen appointed President of the Stake and John Young and ErastusSnow his councillors. Arrangements were being made forinclosing an additional field of 1100 ^acres^; 860 men had taken sharesin it varying from 5 to 10 acres the smallest lots being nearthe city to accomodate the mechanic. All the buildings ofthe fort were to be moved on to city lots except the squareenclosed by the Pioneers. The Indians were friendly andit was considered safe to settle on farms. A new cityhad been laid out 10 miles North of the Temple Block andanother about 10 miles South. All the lots surveyedhad been taken up and an addition had been made runningto the mountains on the East side. The Pioneers claims 
 were to be respected. Elder Addison Pratt had arrived from the SanwichIslands; a company of Saints that went to California on board the Brooklinwere en route  for the Valley; Willard Richards and Amasa Lymanwere within three days drive of Salt Lake City when the expressleft and Dr Richards was driving his own team.Elder Kimball wrote that they had raisedsqushes in the Valley from 63 to 84 lbs and turnips 8 1/2 lbs.Parley Pratt made a vegitable dinner forthe Presidency when they arrived and in the bill of fare wereitems: green corn green peas green beans cucumbers beetsparsnips carrots onions potatoes turnips squashes pumpkinspies cabbage mush mellons water mellons cantelopes, cornbread, wheat bread, corn stalk, molasses rost beef &c.Walker the famous Utah Chief hadvisited the Saints in the Valley with his band of rifflemenHe said he always wished to live in peace with our people.He wanted his children to grow up with ours as brothers. Hispeople should not steal from our people: if they did we were tolet him know and he would punish them and stop it. Thebrethren told him they did not want his men to steal from theCalifornians for we were at peace with them. Walker repliedmy men hate the Spaniards and will steal from them andI cannot help it.Brother Danial Browett Allen and Coxwere all killed by a band of diggers in the Californian mountainsas they were exploring a new pass through the mountainsThey were surrounded when asleep and killed with stones. Onehundred dollars worth of gold dust was found on the ground belongingto brother Allen. Their bodies were stripped of their clothesand then buried by the Indians. This occured 40 milesfrom the settlement on the Sacramento. Their bodies werefound by a company who followed them. These brethrenI baptized in Herefordshire soon after I commenced preaching 
 at John Benbows. Brother Browett especially had been an earnest truehearted Latter-day Saint and I know nothing to the contrary of theothers. They went into the army as soldiers in the Mormon Battalionand have died as martyrs in their mission.Brother Carter wrote that during theConference in the Valley Lyman White had been retained inhis standing for they did not know that the Church had withdrawnfellowship from him at the Bluffs nor had received his pamplet.On the 2nd of Feb I received 24 Nosof the Millennial Star and from a letter written by ParleyP. Pratt August 1848 I gathered the following concerningthe prosperity of the Valley in the first year of our settlement:"We are blessed in gardens in wheat andcorn and in all things I have set my hand unto. I haveraised some sixty bushels of good wheat without irrigationa few bushels of rye and oats and my corn in the fieldlooks as well as any corn I ever saw in the States. Thewheat crop exceeds all expectation. Oats do better than in theStates say 60 bushels to one of the sowing in good ground. Everykind of vegetables suited to the Northren latitudes does wellLevi Hancock sowed seven pounds weight of California wheaton the 14th of April and reaped 22 bushels the latter part of July. He sowed half a bushel of common English wheaton an acre and half and reaped upwards of twenty bushelsOne grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two earsBarley that was sown ripened and was reaped and carriedoff. The land then was irrigated and produced from theroots a fresh crop four times the quantity of the first cropOats that were sown produced a good crop and cleared. Theroots again sprung up and produced another beautiful cropThree crops of peas ripened on the same spot of ground andthe peas of the crop raised used for seed. Beet sead plantedthis Spring produce beets as thick as a mans leg and go to 
 seed and yield a large quantity. Cabage seed planted this Spring producesseed again."Sunday the 4th I had a meeting in the forepartof the day with my family My wife and children come together oncea week. We sang and prayed and then I taught them the thingsof the Kingdom of God; after which I was accustomed to break bread withand partake of the Sacrament with them.On this Sabbath my only son being nineyears of age and a good youth and under the influence of the Spiritof God I ordained him to the office of Priest to officiate in thatoffice in his father's household until he arrived at suitable age toofficiate in the ChurchMy wife Phebe when I was away from myfamily attending to the affairs of the Church would call my childrentogether and teach and instruct them to pray and to understand theprinciples of faith and the Gospel and now my son Wilfordcould administer the sacrament to my family when debaredthe privilege of attending meeting at a Branch of the Church.I met with the Boston Branch of theChurch and as Bro Badlam the Presiding Elder had left forCalifornia I thought it wisdom to appoint another and soI appointed Elder Stephen H Pierce.On the 15th of February I wrote a letterto President Young and Council containing two sheets of foolscappaper written in my journal hand giving at account of myleaving Council Bluffs my meetings at Mount Pisgah andGarden Grove my providential delivery from death visit toNauvoo and the Temple meeting at St. Louis death of ourchild on the journey arrival at Boston burning of Albanystay of my family in Maine and return to Cambridge port.I also represented my travels among the Churches the branchesas numbering 808 ^members^ the capacity of the Saints to gatherto the Valley of the Rocky Mountains the course I had pursued 
 in teaching, the report of the Elders that the people had no interest inhearing the Gospel in this land the number we had baptized &cI also wrote another letter to President Young and Council concering thevisit of Babbit course of T. H Benton, William Smith's appearanceand teaching gold fever excitement &c. I also wrote an Historicalletter to the Historian's office made extracts from my journal concerningthe leading features of the signs of the times the revolutions ofEurope the return of the Jews spread of the Gospel progress of thework in the British Isles and the affairs of America.March the 1st of this year I was 42years of age. The following is an extract from a letter writtenby me this day to Orson Pratt in Liverpool:Cambridgeport March 1st 1849Elder Pratt:Beloved Brother,As this is my birthday also the firstday of Spring my mind is led more than usual this morningto reflect upon the signs of the times and while meditating uponZion and her swift Messengers my mind flies across theocean to a large company of them who are the "horns" of Josephto push the people together from the ends of the earth.These meditations create a desire toconverse a few moments with Brother Pratt. So while allnature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day which awakesman from his slumber I seat myself to say a few wordsto you.I said this was my birthday. Yes Iam 42 years old this day. How such figures look to aman while counting up his years in this probation. Thevery sight of them crowd into ^ones^ mind a flood of thought evenmore than tongue can utter or pen can write. Thelast sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring 
 to preach the Gospel and build up the kingdom of God in connection withmy brethren.The past is gone. I have no desire to recallit. I would not wish to live my life over again if I could. I feel like looking forward and not backward. I have a great desirethat I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousnesshonouring the Priesthood and my calling saving the souls of men andbuilding up the Kingdom of God that I may have a place with thefaithful at the end of the race.Turn my eyes which way I will either towardsBabylon or Zion and I find the movements and signs of both fullykeeping pace with the wheels of time.It is deeply interesting to see hear feel andlive in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the whole earthwhich is rushing like a mighty cataract to finish its work.While the Jews were highminded and inthe light of their pride the Son of God in Lamb like meeknessbowed to the ordinance of baptism and all the rites of the Gospeland commandments of his father looking forward to the day whenhe should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward uponhis head. So at the present day while Emperors Kings PrincesLords Nobles Presidents and the great men of Babylon havebeen making a desperate effort to maintain their dignity andappear to good advantage before the whole earth many of thenoblest spirits that ever dwelt in flesh like Jesus and the Apostleshave been meekly submitting to the ordinances of the Gospeland like little children been subject to the authority of the HolyPriesthood. They have made every sacrifice required andlaboured day and night to build up Zion that the honest inheart and meek of the earth may have a place to flee toin order to escape the just judgement of that God whose rodis now suspended in the heavens and about to fall upon theearth and lay Great Babylon with all her greatness pomp 
 power and glory in the dust.My prayer to God is that every Elder of Israeland Saint of God throughout the whole earth may be encouraged tolabour dilligently and faithfully while the day of harvest lastsfor soon night will come when no man can work: then theywill be just as sure of their reward as was their chiefcaptain and Head.Sunday the 4th I met a congregationof Saints and Strangers at brother Birds at 2 o'clock. ElderWhipple from the Valley was present and Elder JesseP. Haven from the Bluffs. We had a full house andmyself and the newly arrived brethren addressed the peopleAfter which I administered the sacrament and confirmedtwo persons and blessed three children.A curious circumstance took placein the history of the Presidents of the United States this yearPresident Polk went out of office of on Saturday the 3rd of Marchand President Taylor was installed on the Monday so thatfor one day the United States was without a President inconsequence of the Sunday intervening.On the 13th of March I called uponFrancis N. Mitchell stone seal engraver &c 15 TremontRow Boston and searched a record entitled General Armouryof England by John Burnard Burke Heraldry.

 I parted with brother Little and my family on the 16th andtook packet left at 6 o'clock P.M. sailed through the night and landed atthe Breakwater 7 miles North of South Dennis at 5 o'clock in the morninga distance of 60 miles. Thence by carriage with 7 passengers and thecarriage broke down but I reached Brother Nathaniel Eldridge's housespent the day and preached there at night.Next day was Sunday. I met with a largecongregation of the inhabitants of the Cape Saints Captains sailors fishermenChristian and infidels and preached in the forenoon afternoon andevening and then held a church meeting until midnight. I organizeda church here with 21 members and appointed Nathaniel EldridgePresiding Elder and Horace Humphry and Thomas T. Eldridge hiscouncillors. I baptized and confirmed one & administered untotwo that were sick.On the Monday I parted with the Saintsat Cape Cod and returned home where I found my father-in-lawEzra Carter sen. It was the first time he had ever had anopportunity of visiting us.My Father-in-Law BaptizedMarch the 22nd 1849When Joseph Smith sen. the First Patriarch of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints laid his hands upon myhead to give me my Patriarchal blessing he said I shouldhave my father's household standing with me in thecovenant of the Gospel and that I should have power to bringthem into the Kingdom. I afterwards visited my father'shousehold preached to them the Gospel and baptized my father^stepmother^ sister and every member of my father's household and severalother relatives. My wife also whose maiden namewas Phebe W. Carter received a promise that she shouldhave her father and his household in the new and everlasting 
 Covenant. Her mother was baptized before her death two of hersisters were in the church her two brothers were now also veryfriendly though her brother Ezra had been much opposed till recentlyand this day her father Ezra Carter Sen. was baptized andbecame a member of the Church. I walked through thecity of Boston with my father-in-law and his grandsonCalvin Foss who was going to California in the shipArealus which we visited; and after visiting many partsof Boston we returned home and held a meeting at my hired house which I hired.I opened our family meeting by prayer BroJesse C. Little then addressed us and William Page spoke andthen I arose and addressed my friends for an hour in muchplainness and in the expression of my feelings.At the close of the meeting I led myfather-in-law Ezra Carter Sen. with two others down into thesea and baptized them. Mrs Woodruff accompanied her fatherto the water and back again and we both felt to rejoice thatthe words of the old Patriarch Joseph Smith were fulfilled uponour heads.Father Ezra Carter was 76 years and threedays old at the time that I baptized him. He was the sonof Ezra Carter 84 years of age when he died, who was the sonof Daniel Carter who was the son of Ezekiel Carter. Themother of my wife's father bore the maiden name of PhebeWhitmore and she was the daughter of Elias WhitmoreNext day Father Carter Calvin FossWilliam Page myself and Mrs Woodruff visited Mount Auburnwhich is considered one of the most interesting cemetry's inthe world. We next visited Bunker Hill Monument andFather Carter though 76 years old walked to the top of thatmonument 222 feet high. After taking our viewsaround we returned home. 
 On Sunday the 25th at a Sacrament meeting I confirmed3 persons one of whom was my wifes father Ezra Carter.On the 31st I took the train to New York andpreached on the next day Sunday April 1st to the Saints of that city.I packed up all the New York Heralds andtook with me for the Historian's Office and went by rail and boat on the4th to Philadelphia.Some days afterwards I did up a packages andpamphlets for the Presidency and a full file of the New York Heraldfor the Historian Willard Richards.On the 12th emigrating Saints took passagein a section boat for Pittsburg 71 in number 50 of whom werefrom Philadelphia; and I took boat to Beverly.Next day I spent several hours on the banksof the Delaware river watching the fishermen catching fish and inthe afternoon took cars for Beardingtown and walked 5 miles to CalebWright's and was very weary.In the morning I arose with sore feet andwalked to Jacobstown and to Hornerstown and I ought to have goneto Armytown. I was sent 4 miles out of the way. The windblew so hard I could scarcely walk against it. I carried my carpetbag and walked 10 miles with blistered toes and weary limbs and Ifelt as though I could hardly get to Hornstown Hornerstown. I arrived atElder Curtis at at noon weary and lame took dinner and went tobed. William Smith had visited this region and had drawnsome three or four after him.After preaching here to the Saints on theSunday, I left on the Monday and went 30 miles to Toms Riverand several days afterwards returned to Hornerstown again. Whilethere I baptized and confirmed three persons of Mr Wycalf'sfamily. They had been believing many years. Josephthe Twelve and others have visited them. I blessed 4 childrenlaid hands upon three who were sick and then rode to 
 to Boardentown called upon Sister Fenting and took cars for NewarkNew Jersey. I saw an old blind man fall from the cars on to thetrack and break his ribs. He suffered much.I was at Bloomfield on Sunday the 22ndwhere I preached baptized and confirmed one ordained one Elderadministered.On the 23rd I took the rail to New Yorkwhere I heard that T.D. Brown from Liverpool had waited a week tosee me. I found him at the hotel opposite Jersey city ferryand spent several hours with him. He had paid the fare of manyfamilies to Zion who went with Captain Dan Jones and OrsonSpencer and had sent on about 10,000 dollars worth of goods to theValley. He was known on the steamship as a Latter-daySaint and the first officers of the steamer with the mates clerkpurser &c came to see him leave the city for the West.During the following week I travelleddaily from place to place ranging a distance up from 35 to 75 miles each day met with the Churches and cut off 4 fromthe Church for committing adultery.On the 30 I held a meeting at thehouse of Jairus Sandford's and organized the Saints of Fair Haveninto a Branch of the Church over which I appointed and ordainedSherman Barnes Presiding Elder.On the 2nd of May I organizeda Branch of the Church at Naugabug andappointed Samuel Wells Presiding Elder.I continued travelling from place toplace in the discharge of my ministerial duties and on the 14thI returned home to my family and spent a little timein Boston where I saw Brother Cannon and Elder Thomas 
 McKenzie who was packing up a large box of books which he had collectedfor the schools in the Valley.There had been a great mob at New York. Thepapers for several days had been full of it. The Boston Daily Timescontained a long article headed: "Dreadful Riot and Bloodshedat the Astor Place Theatre. The military called out. Firing onthe People. Awful Sacrifice of Life.

I thenlaid my hands upon him and ordained him to the office of HighPriest and to the office of a Patriarch in the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. It was fully manifested to me that hewas of the blood of Ephraim and the power of God rested upon usand we were filled with the spirit of prophecy and rejoicing.The New York Herald contained anaccount of the visit of the Engeneers of the Danoma railroadEpxpeditions to the people lately dicovered called the MandingoIndians at the Mandingo Bay which contains 113 Islandsheld in the sole possession of the Mandingo Indians who do 
 shall not permit there the residence of any human beings not of their own tribe and lineage. They would not as yet communicate to any but their own tribe any knowledge of their records or history. They live by themselvessome occupying the Islands some the main land but all firmly unitedas a band obeying one chief or Old Man (a Patriarch) who is believed to be endowed by God with all wisdom might and power. Their government is Patriarchal and the Old Man or Patriachal is the spiritual adviser as well as chief of all temporal affairs.He is said to be powerful in mind an body and all his faculties evergreen. He is acknowledged and regarded as the Vicegerant of God and all his orders are obeyed and in all cases of sickness or infirmity they apply to him and whether relief is obtained or not applicants are contented.Col. Hughes propounded to the Old Manthe question "upon whom does the office of Old Man descendat the decease of the present Old Man. The reply was to the next oldest man of the tribe. "Suppose the successor should not be endowed with the same qualities of inteligence?" Thereply was that cannot be for when the mantle descends the Great Spirit imbues that mind with all knowledge."Before approaching the entrance of theMandingo Bay some 20 miles from land we discovered a fleetof canoes under sail managed with a skill equal to the best Waterhall boatmen and on bearing down found them to contain Mandingo Indians upon a fishing excursion. xxxx The men are short and stumpy not over 5 feet 6 on the average thick and square built and capable of enduring great fatigue. Their headsare remarkably large and round features prominant with all the physiognomy of the Jew. They have a plurality of wives according to their means. They permit no communication with foreigners and a woman so offending is stoned to deathIt is a part of their religious creed to keep their races pureand unadulterated. They profess to have a restorative for 
 the organs of production the effect of which upon one administration will last for eight years. Our surgeon obtained some of the remedy which has been pronounced part and parcel of the body of the turtle. A question arose as to whether this people be not descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. xxx In trying to get some clue of their early history the question was asked who lived here 400 or 500 years ago. The reply was "Tims Father." We asked an old man who looked about 60 years of age how old he was; he replied 121 years."The foregoing is extracts from the account which this expidition of Engeneers gave and which is interesting to the beleiver in the Book of Mormon ^which is^ the History of the aboriginesof America.It had now been reliably ascertained concerning the recent great fire at St Louis that 418 buildings had been burned20 lives lost six million dollars loss of property two thirds of the wholesale a wise drygoods dealers and one half of the retail and other stores of the city were burned.The City of New Orleans was inundated lives were lost immense property destroyed and danger of the whole city being washed into the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi breaking through the levy and running into the city.On the 2nd of June with Leonard Hardy I went to Bradford held meetings and returned to Boston on the 5th.Fearful accounts of disasters of w^r^ecks fires inundations cholera wars and revolutions were daily teeming the newspapers of this date and the gold diggers and their perils on the plains in their rush to California formed also much matter for the papers.On the 16th I arranged my businessto leave home for a season in my mission in the ministry among the Churches around; and on the 18th I was at Portland and spent the night at Father Carters. 
 From thence I made a visit to the Islands.Twelve years before I carried the Gospel to Fox Island and gathered with me at the close of my mission to the Islands of the Sea about 60souls ^out^ of about ^a^ hundred which I baptized while there. I now paid these Islands a visit agains and after staying there several weeksI started for New Brunswick CanadaConsiderable of the distance I walked.One day after shouldering my carpet bag and walking 7 miles I waited 3 hours for the Stage to go to St John's and when it came along it was loaded down and could not take me. HereI had 42 miles to reach St John's on foot with a heavy travellingbag and no conveyance with a vast burning forest to go through.I did not stop to meditate or complain of my situation but swung my carpet sack over my shoulder and started on foot in good spirits. Most of the road was through dense forest rocky and poor soil many parts of the forest was inhabited by bears and wolves.After travelling a few ^miles^ I overtook an Irishman and we walked several miles together when a man came along in a waggon and carried my bag 5 mileson before me to Mr McGowings. When I arrived I found it safe and had a chance to send it on 15 miles farther to Mr Tilton's. I took dinner with the Irishman we and left him and I had 15 miles more to walk before I could stop for the night.I found the whole forest as I came along laid waste by the late fires which swept fencesdwellings barns mills lumber yard and everything else in its march leaving but a few dwellings remaining.Although I began to be very weary and lame yet I entered the dark forest before me and I found my last 15 miles a dreary road indeed. It seemed as though I could not get through and when I did arrive 
 at Mr Tilton's I was so lame I could scarcely walk at all and I was underthe necessity of going to bed without my supper. I washed myself in coldwater from head to foot to take the soreness out of my cords. I had walked 35 miles during the day a thing which I had not done before for 10 years.After journeying by foot boat and stage we arrived at the ferry of the Beaubours Island on the 22nd of July whereI left the stage feeling very thankful that my bones were whole and my life preserved.I crossed the ferry to the Island walked one mile through a pleasant grove to the house of Elder JosephRussel's.  I found him home and had a happy greeting. I was thankful to shake hands with a Latter-day Saint after travelling two weeks without seeing any of the Saints.I was quite unwell next morning whichwas Sunday.Elder Joseph Russell was located upon an Island called Beauburs Island situated at the junctionof the two branches of the Miramichis River 7 miles aboveChatham. The Island is 1 1/2 miles in length and halfa mile wide. Brother Russell had owned the whole of the Island for eleven years during which time he hadbuilt 23 ships upon it with an average tonage of 650tons each. His location land and improvements were at a low rate worth $30,000 besides 3 ships on hand. He was calculating to sell on the 5th of Nov at some price or other settle his business and go to the Valley.The Island was a very beautiful and plesant situation a good location for ship building in the centre of the river which abounds with salmon mackeral herring chadand other fish in their season.Brother Russell was also a Presiding Elderover a small Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints on
