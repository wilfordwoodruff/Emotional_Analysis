Meeting opened by prayer by O Pratt who arose we have often been  taught to listen to council given from the head I do not consider it necessary to treat to day upon the first principles of the gospel as those things are understood by you as well as by me. I have thought of treating upon scientific Principles there is no truth but what comes from God, it requires a portion of the spirit of God to know   ENDENTRY  some classes adore the book of nature &amp; deny a God, others Profess to adore God and are afraid to contemplat Natural things but evry truth  should be acknowledged as from God a variety is interesting &amp; not always remain in one channel one of the most interesting feasts I ever enjoyed  was in contemplating the worlds and laws by which they are governed. Men should be learned  in order to convince the learned for instans a man rises up &amp; says I will not believe a thing that I cannot comprehend by one  of my 5 senses but the learned man knows  that many truths come by reflection thinking  &amp; drinking &amp; again an Elder may tell a con- gregation that matter is an eternal principle and exhisted before God made this world they would not believe it because it comes in contact with there tradition for they have been taught to believe  from there youth up that God made the Heavens and earth and all the planetary system in six  days out of nothing. But let that Elder become  acquainted with facts that can be demonstrated and he can present arguments to that people that will convince them the more learned the better as a proof that worlds exhisted before this was formed or at least more than 7000 years let him present the demonstrated fact that through the aid of strong glasses that planets can be seen so far distant that it would  take 24000 years for the light of them to reach this planet according to asstrinomical calculations they then must be 24000 years old &amp; just as  likely to have exhisted millions of years before again as a proof that matter is eternal and that  this earth was formed out of unorganized matter   ENDENTRY  morning &amp; look at the sword in the belt of orion and he can see unorganized matter enough to make a Million of Million of Million of worlds each as large  as the sun. A man of wisdon &amp; Judgment can demonstrate truth for himself independant of all authors and when he finds a thing is true believe it though all the world disbelieve it besides &amp; when he finds a thing fals disbelieve it &amp; renounce it thogh it be sustained by all Christondon &amp; phylosiphers and asstronimers of the age. we should esstablish schools for our children to teach them principle &amp; truth learning is a good thing a blessing from God &amp; will prove so to us if we make a right use of it but a bad use would prove a curse. but because some have made a bad use of learning or even of the Holy Ghost &amp; power of God as Lucipher in the rebellion of Heaven does that argue that we should not get learning or seak for the Holy Ghost certainly not. there are many hours that both parents &amp; children squander away that might be spent in learning, but if our children grow up in ignoranc they with there posterity would degenerat untill they would be as ignorant as the savagas that surround us. The Lord will not do a miracle to give us learning when we can get it ourselves. Some have an idea that is no matter about getting knowledge here thinking that by &amp; by that they will enter heaven &amp; that God will fill there minds with all the knowledge of the eternal worlds but they will be mistaken in this for they will have  to learn it little by little as here.    People to be subject to council. like clay in the hands of the Potter as to learning there is difference in men in this thing I spent one winter in learning grammer  and all I did learn about it was the difference betwee singular &amp; plural number what knowledge I ever did get God helped me to I desire to love that which is   ENDENTRY  our bodies ought not to bow down to any wrong thing &amp; ought not to be defiled but to be used for noble purposes and as our bodies &amp; spirits are used for good and good purposes they have no time to do evil but ascendency is gained over evil &amp; that spirit that has the power brings forth the fruit of its own work  whether it be good or evil.

Also that dogs be taken care of &amp; to shoot no more dogs without the order of the Marshall &amp;c    words upon Principle I desire the brethren and  sisters to be taught in all things necessary. There is one thing I want you to realize and that is  that God, Angels, &amp; Saints Heaven and all of Gods creation are governed by law and I want the Camp of Israel to understand that we must be and if Heaven was not controlled by law what for a place would it be I would not wish to be  there for were we rushed into Heaven without  law evry man would be in danger of loosing his  rights &amp; having them trampeld upon but all celestial beings are governed by law &amp; perfect  order yea the celestial law is a perfect order of things a perfect system of light, law, intelligence exhaltation &amp; glory where evry persons rights are sustained to the fulest extent   ENDENTRY  as an Apostle said we have precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little, untill we arive at a fulness of knowledge &amp; glory even that fulness that reigns in the Heavens. we must begin to be governd by law here before we are prepared to recieve those blessings. the whole law has not been given &amp; you cannot abide the whole law as yet. if it had all been given, we should  have been smashed up &amp; destroyed a people must become acquainted thoroughly with law before they can abide it but the time has come when we must have law oand order in our midst. There has been some feelings of late in the camp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshall for th this camp is not willing to let law &amp; order reign  here &amp; put a stop to such wickedness I wish  you to let me know it &amp; I will go away from  you for those that wish to sustain crime &amp; corrup- tion let them return &amp; strike hands with the mob &amp; carry out there principles &amp; be damm- ed. but if you want to do right say so, this people have been driven here for there desires to do righteousness. And this wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest in the camp by certain young people of late yes it will be stoped if God come out &amp; smites it by Judgment. The Marshall did not whip them hard enough, if he had they would not have spit out there revenge but it would have been whiped out of them. If I am drove to the necessit of whipping a person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwards for I will whip it out of them. Shall we any longer  sustain in our midst men that will carry  out the principles of John C Bennet and   ENDENTRY  by the Eternal God of Heaven shuch conduct  shall be stoped &amp; shall not be permitted in  this camp for if they continue it I will  tell the Marshall what  shall be taken care of in a manner that  they will not whine and I will whip any  man that will sustain it for those that will  sustain it shall be whiped. And I prophecy  in the name of God such a man whether  old or young shall be bowed down with  sorrow &amp; morning even more than this people  have. then stop before you further go &amp;  not sport upon the brink of sorrow &amp; morning This people have the Law of Liberty &amp; the  gospel &amp; the more the light &amp; liberty &amp; greater  the privileges the stricter the Law. we are  going into the wilderness &amp; shall we suffer such  things no I swear by the Eternal God such  things shall not be while brigham lives.  Br Kimball gave a good shot when he  said no man run into his waggon &amp; swore  he would shut the Marshall if he come  after him except he was guilty of crime  no man is afraid except he is guilty. No  man need be afraid that does right. I defy  the world to say I have taken any mans right  but after we have been driven into the wilderness  we are still followed by men who sware they  will steal what they have in our midst, I sware  they shall not have it in our midst. Some  young Elders that never preached a sermon  in their lives are afraid that I shall have  more blessings than they, or more wives or  sumthing or other but let them go &amp; preach  the world over as I have done in poverty   ENDENTRY  years &amp; years at it &amp; left my wife &amp; children  who have also suffered much. let them do as  we have done &amp; they will not be jealous of  me about blessings. If the Lord should give  me a thousand women is it any mans business  No. Let such go and spend as much time as  I have and there will be many clinging on to  there skirts to be saved. the majority of the  men of the gentile world will be damned and  the women wish to be saved by going with good  men. And a woman that has the spirit of God  will go with a good man who has been  faithful &amp; spent much of his time in saveing  mankind and has the priest hood such men  if they continue faithful will be saved in eternal  glory &amp; those that are with him. I an determined  that my affections shall be with God, I will  not allow them to be placed on things that  perish when plagues &amp; diseases get hold of our  bodies we become loathsome &amp; beauty fades away  but our affections should be placed upon things  that are noble exhalted lasting &amp; glorious I love  an exhalted mind for it is eternal &amp; cannot fade I want all my affections to be subject to God  and glory &amp; eternal life.

I had one block for my company which  consisted of near 40 families so I had to  put about 2 families on a block. It was a vary  busy day we had no yard so we lost many of our  cattle at night   ENDENTRY September 24, 1846    drew poles &amp; made fence to keep the cattle    ENDENTRY September 25, 1846    Nauvoo I sat about one hour  and herd them relate the state of affairs in that  city the mob of Hancock county &amp; the State of  Illinois had swollen to about 1000 men had  come upon Nauvoo &amp; 100 of the Saints had kept  them off 3 days then had a pitched battle of one hour 20 minutes &amp; drove the mob off the  ground with the loss of three of the Saints &amp;  how many of the mob was not known by us  but as Br Wells will give a public statement  I shall write it more full. I spent the day  hunting cattle and lost my mule saddle bridle  and 2 ducks I had killed I got wet &amp; had to  walk home. 15 miles    ENDENTRY September 26, 1846    saddle &amp; ducks all right I spent the day hunting  cattle &amp; exploring the country I found all our  cattle.

Block. Meeting opened by prayer by O. Pratt who also remarked that we had suffered by the gentiles a long time; but had now gone out of there midst &amp; hoped we should rest for a season from there grasp. had rather suffer the fatigues of this wilderness journey and live on game than suffer by mobs. would rather fall into the hands of God than a mob as God is more merciful. I have heard the prophet say that God could not controle the wicked at all times and let them act upon their agency without operating upon them as a machine. I am contented whare I am but should be more so if we had an abundanc of the necessaries of life, the mob at last  have had courage after gathering &amp; threatning  for about 6 years to come against the Saints in Nauvoo from one thousand to twelve hundred men had came against one hundred of the Saints and have a pitched battle, but the Saints went out to battle in the name of God &amp; their ene- mies were defeated.    give a short account of affairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard that men were lynched there. we took 15 of the   ENDENTRY  a trial were let out on bail, the mob then issued writs against Furnice the two latter went Picket would not a mob  was then raised as a possee to execute the  writs they said. they staid several weeks to increas there numbers they had at first about 300. ^and increased to 1000^ the 100 men we had lay in ambush for the mob they canonaded through the day but done no harm. Next day they tried the same again we repelled them. On Saturday at  city with 1000 or 12000 men we met them  in the name of God and gained the victory the action lasted one hour &amp; 20 minutes they fired 42 cannon ball &amp; we 32 ball though the mob were 10 to our one they were defeated &amp; retreated from the battle field we had three killed and none wounded. the mob would  not acknowledge any killed but we walked over the battle ground &amp; found a plenty of mob blood. One man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies in one waggon that were handled like dead &amp; other waggons were loaded in the same way. one of the Saints lying in a suller saw 8 wounded brought to the building each one telling whare he was shot, they dug at there intrenchment after the battle it was supposed they buried there dead there. the next day  was sunday they did not shute any we flung some ball &amp; burst one cannon on Monday the mob sent us a cannon ball to let us know they had some left &amp; we sent it back agan  during the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike &amp; run &amp; get it &amp; bring it to us &amp; we would send it back. On Tuesday a committee was sent to us   ENDENTRY  parties a brigade was then called for, but afterwards a treaty was made. we agreed to surrender the city &amp; leave in 5 days On wednesday evening the treaty was made and the Saints bgan to pack up their goods and the next day all goods was removed as the mob came in we left 2 blocks in advance. we met many of the Saints on this side of the river in distress &amp; it drew tears from the eyes of some of the  We saw camp fires of the mob the same night we left on both sides of the river There were scenes transpired in the siege enough to melt the heart of a stone, the lynching of men when they are labouring for a living &amp; whiping them untill they cannot stand alone as the mob did was a damnable thing they made them kneel on a spot whare they said some one was buried placed them in a position so they could be whiped easy an old revolutioner was one of them and  was so beat by the mob that he has not been able to get about all summer. I have an old grand Father, a Revolutioner I have thought I would not let him know any thing about it but keep it from him that his feelings may not be harrow up as he is about ready to step into his grave. But I will say no more but give way for    ony that what Br Wells has said is strictly true according to the best of my knowledge. If I was to talk untill sun down the whole could not  be told. I have been kept in Nauvoo by the hand of God others wanted to have been here and would have been had it not been necessary to have stoped to save our brethren there who could   ENDENTRY  made manifest in the salvation of the people in Nauvoo I thank God I had a hand in the battle and the hand of God was so visible in that  battle that many that were weak &amp; faltering have been much strengthend by it and will gather with the saints. I did not expect that God  would deliver their enemies into their hands but expected that God would save them out of the  hands of their enemies and this he has done I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo the time has come for us to depart God has called upon us to go and if we will not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out, but they will not  get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongs to the. I hope the day will come when we shall not have to suffer from Mobs as we have done. But if we had sought  to have saved our lives in this case by fleeing many would have lost them for but few  could have fled. But we went out in the name of God and conquered through the blessings of God we done well. one brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to spy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a  sheep. The mob do not acknowledge they had any killed dut they had a good deal of blood spilled which they could not cover  up which I saw. Capt Smith who was Capt of the guard at the time of the death of Joseph was shot in the neck but not killed another  commander was also shot, we have done the best we could, to kill the poor Devels and we are satisfyed with the result and leave it all in the hands of God. Br Wells has done well   ENDENTRY  danger, as well as safety. with regard to the citizens of Nauvoo there were but few who stood by us in time of trouble there are many spirits in Nauvoo  that are like bats ready to join any party that  conquer if the beast conquer they will show ther legs if the featherd tribe there wings. we left the mob in the city hoping that the time would come when we could gain a greater victory over them.    a few remarks attached to the remarks that have been made. I will inform the brethren that have come up we are glad to see them. Br Wells has been in our society for several years and I have had considerable acquaintance with him  and I am more than ever satisfyed with his  course. we have prayed for our brethren con- tinually I am sensible there is a good deal of  suffering there and here, but let me say the Lord  God who has fed us all the day long, has his care still over us, when the Saints are chastened enough it will scease at least the hand of God will be visible in there salvation, some individuals may fall but the body will be sustained I have never believed the Lord would suffer a general Massacrce of this people by a mob. If 10,000 men were to come against us if no other way was open the earth would open and swallow them up some say they can  stay in Nauvoo and can live there in perfet peace they are so righteous, there are some that have no better eyes than to say let me live with the wicked in peace but there blessings  will be scearce with the mob, and if they  do not leave I fear they will prove a scourge   ENDENTRY  by law and when they trespass upon his rights God is there to maintain them.
