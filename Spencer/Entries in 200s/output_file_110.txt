Meeting opened by prayer by O Pratt who arose we have often been  taught to listen to council given from the head I do not consider it necessary to treat to day upon the first principles of the gospel as those things are understood by you as well as by me. I have thought of treating upon scientific Principles there is no truth but what comes from God, it requires a portion of the spirit of God to know   ENDENTRY what portion of truth to lay before the people some classes adore the book of nature and deny a God, others Profess to adore God and are afraid to contemplat Natural things but evry truth  should be acknowledged as from God a variety is interesting and not always remain in one channel one of the most interesting feasts I ever enjoyed  was in contemplating the worlds and laws by which they are governed. Men should be learned  in order to convince the learned for instans a man rises up and says I will not believe a thing that I cannot comprehend by one  of my 5 senses but the learned man knows  that many truths come by reflection thinking and s and not by seeing feeling hearing eating  and drinking and again an Elder may tell a con- gregation that matter is an eternal principle and exhisted before God made this world they would not believe it because it comes in contact with there tradition for they have been taught to believe  from there youth up that God made the Heavens and earth and all the planetary system in six  days out of nothing. But let that Elder become  acquainted with facts that can be demonstrated and he can present arguments to that people that will convince them the more learned the better as a proof that worlds exhisted before this was formed or at least more than 7000 years let him present the demonstrated fact that through the aid of strong glasses that planets can be seen so far distant that it would  take 24000 years for the light of them to reach this planet according to asstrinomical calculations they then must be 24000 years old and just as  likely to have exhisted millions of years before again as a proof that matter is eternal and that  this earth was formed out of unorganized matter   ENDENTRY let a man take a good telescope at 4 oclock in a clear morning and look at the sword in the belt of orion and he can see unorganized matter enough to make a Million of Million of Million of worlds each as large  as the sun. A man of wisdon and Judgment can demonstrate truth for himself independant of all authors and when he finds a thing is true believe it though all the world disbelieve it besides and when he finds a thing fals disbelieve it and renounce it thogh it be sustained by all Christondon and phylosiphers and asstronimers of the age. we should esstablish schools for our children to teach them principle and truth learning is a good thing a blessing from God and will prove so to us if we make a right use of it but a bad use would prove a curse. but because some have made a bad use of learning or even of the Holy Ghost and power of God as Lucipher in the rebellion of Heaven does that argue that we should not get learning or seak for the Holy Ghost certainly not. there are many hours that both parents and children squander away that might be spent in learning, but if our children grow up in ignoranc they with there posterity would degenerat untill they would be as ignorant as the savagas that surround us. The Lord will not do a miracle to give us learning when we can get it ourselves. Some have an idea that is no matter about getting knowledge here thinking that by and by that they will enter heaven and that God will fill there minds with all the knowledge of the eternal worlds but they will be mistaken in this for they will have  to learn it little by little as here.   Elder Kimball arose and said it was necessary for this People to be subject to council. like clay in the hands of the Potter as to learning there is difference in men in this thing I spent one winter in learning grammer  and all I did learn about it was the difference betwee singular and plural number what knowledge I ever did get God helped me to I desire to love that which is   ENDENTRY our spirits ought not to stoop to any mean thing and our bodies ought not to bow down to any wrong thing and ought not to be defiled but to be used for noble purposes and as our bodies and spirits are used for good and good purposes they have no time to do evil but ascendency is gained over evil and that spirit that has the power brings forth the fruit of its own work  whether it be good or evil. He said while on this Journey many said they would do so and so if the Presidency commanded them so Brigham had to command them before he could get it done but we should do good without being commanded to do it   The Marshall arose and said there were some acts passed by the City Council which he would mention that there be no shooting of fire arms after sun down and no timber cut within 20 miles of here without the direction of the Council. Also that dogs be taken care of and to shoot no more dogs without the order of the Marshall andc   President Young arose and said I wish to say a few words upon Principle I desire the brethren and  sisters to be taught in all things necessary. There is one thing I want you to realize and that is  that God, Angels, and Saints Heaven and all of Gods creation are governed by law and I want the Camp of Israel to understand that we must be and if Heaven was not controlled by law what for a place would it be I would not wish to be  there for were we rushed into Heaven without  law evry man would be in danger of loosing his  rights and having them trampeld upon but all celestial beings are governed by law and perfect  order yea the celestial law is a perfect order of things a perfect system of light, law, intelligence exhaltation and glory where evry persons rights are sustained to the fulest extent   ENDENTRY but we do not arive at this knowledge at once, but as an Apostle said we have precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little, untill we arive at a fulness of knowledge and glory even that fulness that reigns in the Heavens. we must begin to be governd by law here before we are prepared to recieve those blessings. the whole law has not been given and you cannot abide the whole law as yet. if it had all been given, we should  have been smashed up and destroyed a people must become acquainted thoroughly with law before they can abide it but the time has come when we must have law oand order in our midst. There has been some feelings of late in the camp because some unruly boys have been floged by the Marshall for thiere wickedness, but if this camp is not willing to let law and order reign  here and put a stop to such wickedness I wish  you to let me know it and I will go away from  you for those that wish to sustain crime and corrup- tion let them return and strike hands with the mob and carry out there principles and be damm- ed. but if you want to do right say so, this people have been driven here for there desires to do righteousness. And this wickedness shall be put a stop to that has been manifest in the camp by certain young people of late yes it will be stoped if God come out and smites it by Judgment. The Marshall did not whip them hard enough, if he had they would not have spit out there revenge but it would have been whiped out of them. If I am drove to the necessit of whipping a person in such a case they will not spit out revenge afterwards for I will whip it out of them. Shall we any longer  sustain in our midst men that will carry  out the principles of John C Bennet and   ENDENTRY other corrupt scoundrils no I will sware  by the Eternal God of Heaven shuch conduct  shall be stoped and shall not be permitted in  this camp for if they continue it I will  tell the Marshall what they the law is and they  shall be taken care of in a manner that  they will not whine and I will whip any  man that will sustain it for those that will  sustain it shall be whiped. And I prophecy  in the name of God such a man whether  old or young shall be bowed down with  sorrow and morning even more than this people  have. then stop before you further go and  not sport upon the brink of sorrow and morning This people have the Law of Liberty and the  gospel and the more the light and liberty and greater  the privileges the stricter the Law. we are  going into the wilderness and shall we suffer such  things no I swear by the Eternal God such  things shall not be while brigham lives.  Br Kimball gave a good shot when he  said no man run into his waggon and swore  he would shut the Marshall if he come  after him except he was guilty of crime  no man is afraid except he is guilty. No  man need be afraid that does right. I defy  the world to say I have taken any mans right  but after we have been driven into the wilderness  we are still followed by men who sware they  will steal what they have in our midst, I sware  they shall not have it in our midst. Some  young Elders that never preached a sermon  in their lives are afraid that I shall have  more blessings than they, or more wives or  sumthing or other but let them go and preach  the world over as I have done in poverty   ENDENTRY and distress with blood in my shoes and spent  years and years at it and left my wife and children  who have also suffered much. let them do as  we have done and they will not be jealous of  me about blessings. If the Lord should give  me a thousand women is it any mans business  No. Let such go and spend as much time as  I have and there will be many clinging on to  there skirts to be saved. the majority of the  men of the gentile world will be damned and  the women wish to be saved by going with good  men. And a woman that has the spirit of God  will go with a good man who has been with faithful and spent much of his time in saveing  mankind and has the priest hood such men  if they continue faithful will be saved in eternal  glory and those that are with him. I an determined  that my affections shall be with God, I will  not allow them to be placed on things that  perish when plagues and diseases get hold of our  bodies we become loathsome and beauty fades away  but our affections should be placed upon things  that are noble exhalted lasting and glorious I love  an exhalted mind for it is eternal and cannot fade I want all my affections to be subject to God  and glory and eternal life.

If he lay down to be sick he would be  called up so soon that he had no time to be sick  and made remarks upon a variety of things   President Young followed and said he could  soon answer his mind did not fell feel much  like preaching had to administer to the sick  brethren who are labouring hard to keep soul and  body together when I see the suffering that  this people are enduring from the conduct  of professed Christians I feel more like  fighting and swearing than preaching for I see  such strugling to live that I have feelings  for the brethren to see them suffer for their religion I am glad I have not power for I should  use it. when I have I shall have knowledge  to use it. offenses must come but wo unto those  by wholm they come. we are followed by wicked  men who will lie about us and run to Missouri and  say we are triying to kill them andc I hope such  will go away and fall and die.

I had one block for my company which  consisted of near 40 families so I had to  put about 2 families on a block. It was a vary  busy day we had no yard so we lost many of our  cattle at night   ENDENTRY September 24, 1846 ~ Thursday   24th I hunted cattle all day most of the division  drew poles and made fence to keep the cattle    ENDENTRY September 25, 1846 ~ Friday   25th Square  Wells arived in camp also Br  Nauvoo I sat about one hour  and herd them relate the state of affairs in that  city the mob of Hancock county and the State of  Illinois had swollen to about 1000 men had  come upon Nauvoo and 100 of the Saints had kept  them off 3 days then had a pitched battle of one hour 20 minutes and drove the mob off the  ground with the loss of three of the Saints and  how many of the mob was not known by us  but as Br Wells will give a public statement  I shall write it more full. I spent the day  hunting cattle and lost my mule saddle bridle  and 2 ducks I had killed I got wet and had to  walk home. 15 miles    ENDENTRY September 26, 1846 ~ Saturday   26th Saturday I found my mule this morning saddle and ducks all right I spent the day hunting  cattle and exploring the country I found all our  cattle. And traveld a long distance up and down  the river. I also got wet feet to day halling  several cattle out of the mud to save life.

We appointed a meeting at 2 oclok in our new city to hear a statement made by square wells of the affairs in Nauvoo before meeting the cry of fire was heard on the prairie grass of the encampment and all run to put it out and it was soon extinguished.   Meeting opened at 2 oclok PM at the Council Block. Meeting opened by prayer by O. Pratt who also remarked that we had suffered by the gentiles a long time; but had now gone out of there midst and hoped we should rest for a season from there grasp. had rather suffer the fatigues of this wilderness journey and live on game than suffer by mobs. would rather fall into the hands of God than a mob as God is more merciful. I have heard the prophet say that God could not controle the wicked at all times and let them act upon their agency without operating upon them as a machine. I am contented whare I am but should be more so if we had an abundanc of the necessaries of life, the mob at last  have had courage after gathering and threatning  for about 6 years to come against the Saints in Nauvoo from one thousand to twelve hundred men had came against one hundred of the Saints and have a pitched battle, but the Saints went out to battle in the name of God and their ene- mies were defeated.   Daniel H Wells arose and said, I will by request give a short account of affairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard that men were lynched there. we took 15 of the   ENDENTRY of the offenders who were sent to Quincy for a trial were let out on bail, the mob then issued writs against Furnice the two latter went Picket would not a mob  was then raised as a possee to execute the  writs they said. they staid several weeks to increas there numbers they had at first about 300. ^and increased to 1000^ the 100 men we had lay in ambush for the mob they canonaded through the day but done no harm. Next day they tried the same again we repelled them. On Saturday at one oclok they advanced upon the city with 1000 or 12000 men we met them  in the name of God and gained the victory the action lasted one hour and 20 minutes they fired 42 cannon ball and we 32 ball though the mob were 10 to our one they were defeated and retreated from the battle field we had three killed and none wounded. the mob would  not acknowledge any killed but we walked over the battle ground and found a plenty of mob blood. One man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies in one waggon that were handled like dead and other waggons were loaded in the same way. one of the Saints lying in a suller saw 8 wounded brought to the building each one telling whare he was shot, they dug at there intrenchment after the battle it was supposed they buried there dead there. the next day  was sunday they did not shute any we flung some ball and burst one cannon on Monday the mob sent us a cannon ball to let us know they had some left and we sent it back agan  during the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike and run and get it and bring it to us and we would send it back. On Tuesday a committee was sent to us   ENDENTRY to make a treaty but it was rejected by both parties a brigade was then called for, but afterwards a treaty was made. we agreed to surrender the city and leave in 5 days On wednesday evening the treaty was made and the Saints bgan to pack up their goods and the next day all goods was removed as the mob came in we left 2 blocks in advance. we met many of the Saints on this side of the river in distress and it drew tears from the eyes of some of the mob We saw camp fires of the mob the same night we left on both sides of the river There were scenes transpired in the siege enough to melt the heart of a stone, the lynching of men when they are labouring for a living and whiping them untill they cannot stand alone as the mob did was a damnable thing they made them kneel on a spot whare they said some one was buried placed them in a position so they could be whiped easy an old revolutioner was one of them and  was so beat by the mob that he has not been able to get about all summer. I have an old grand Father, a Revolutioner I have thought I would not let him know any thing about it but keep it from him that his feelings may not be harrow up as he is about ready to step into his grave. But I will say no more but give way for Father ^Br^ Cutler  Br Cutler arose and said I can bear my testim- ony that what Br Wells has said is strictly true according to the best of my knowledge. If I was to talk untill sun down the whole could not  be told. I have been kept in Nauvoo by the hand of God others wanted to have been here and would have been had it not been necessary to have stoped to save our brethren there who could   ENDENTRY not get away. I know the hand of God has been made manifest in the salvation of the people in Nauvoo I thank God I had a hand in the battle and the hand of God was so visible in that  battle that many that were weak and faltering have been much strengthend by it and will gather with the saints. I did not expect that God  would deliver their enemies into their hands but expected that God would save them out of the  hands of their enemies and this he has done I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo the time has come for us to depart God has called upon us to go and if we will not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out, but they will not  get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongs to the. I hope the day will come when we shall not have to suffer from Mobs as we have done. But if we had sought  to have saved our lives in this case by fleeing many would have lost them for but few  could have fled. But we went out in the name of God and conquered through the blessings of God we done well. one brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to spy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a  sheep. The mob do not acknowledge they had any killed dut they had a good deal of blood spilled which they could not cover  up which I saw. Capt Smith who was Capt of the guard at the time of the death of Joseph was shot in the neck but not killed another  commander was also shot, we have done the best we could, to kill the poor Devels and we are satisfyed with the result and leave it all in the hands of God. Br Wells has done well   ENDENTRY in all places where he has been put, in the midst of danger, as well as safety. with regard to the citizens of Nauvoo there were but few who stood by us in time of trouble there are many spirits in Nauvoo  that are like bats ready to join any party that  conquer if the beast conquer they will show ther legs if the featherd tribe there wings. we left the mob in the city hoping that the time would come when we could gain a greater victory over them.   President Young arose and said I wish to make a few remarks attached to the remarks that have been made. I will inform the brethren that have come up we are glad to see them. Br Wells has been in our society for several years and I have had considerable acquaintance with him  and I am more than ever satisfyed with his  course. we have prayed for our brethren con- tinually I am sensible there is a good deal of  suffering there and here, but let me say the Lord  God who has fed us all the day long, has his care still over us, when the Saints are chastened enough it will scease at least the hand of God will be visible in there salvation, some individuals may fall but the body will be sustained I have never believed the Lord would suffer a general Massacrce of this people by a mob. If 10,000 men were to come against us if no other way was open the earth would open and swallow them up some say they can  stay in Nauvoo and can live there in perfet peace they are so righteous, there are some that have no better eyes than to say let me live with the wicked in peace but there blessings  will be scearce with the mob, and if they  do not leave I fear they will prove a scourge   ENDENTRY in the hands of God. He works with the wicked by law and when they trespass upon his rights God is there to maintain them. Many other remarks were made by President Young when meeting was dismissed one  hour during the intermission Elders I visited the sick council met in the aftern oon and attended to some business on hand    ENDENTRY September 28, 1846 ~ Monday   28th I went over the river and took a ramble for house logs and some of the company dug out a canoe. 12    ENDENTRY September 29, 1846 ~ Tuesday   29th I went up the river on the west side in company with several others I cut 100 house logs and returned home vary weary  14 m    ENDENTRY September 30, 1846 ~ Wednesday   30th I went up the river to day and cut  about 100 house logs within about 2 miles  of the camp. 4    ENDENTRY October 1, 1846 ~ Thursday   Oct 1st I was nearly sick and confined to my bed in consequence of hard labour    ENDENTRY October 2, 1846 ~ Friday   2ndnd I spent apart of the day in council    ENDENTRY October 3, 1846 ~ Saturday   3rd I spent this day in council and the evening    ENDENTRY October 4, 1846 ~ Sunday   4th Sunday O Pratt deliverd a sermon on the first principle of the gospel had an intermission one hour.
