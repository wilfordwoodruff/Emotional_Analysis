 hour and heard them relate the State of affairs in that city. The mob of  Hancock County and the State of Illinois had swelled to over one thousand  men and had come upon Nauvoo and one hundred of the brethren  had kep[t] them off three days then had a pitched battle of one hour  and twenty minutes and drove the mob off the ground. The loss  of the brethren was 3 killed but that of the mob was not known    The morning of Sunday the 27 we spent hearing  read a Missourian paper giving an account of the battle between  the mob and the Mormons of Nauvoo; also of General Karney's  army of the West among whom was the Mormon Battalion. There  was a prospect of the whole army suffering for want of food.    We appointed a meeting to be held at 2 o'clock  in our new city to hear a statement from Squire Wells of the  affairs in Nauvoo. Before the meeting there was heard the  cry of fire on the prairie grass of the encampment. All ran  to put it out and it was soon extinguished    Meeting opened at 2 o'clock at the Council Block  by prayer from Orson Pratt who also made some remarks upon  the subject of the time and he was then followed by Squire Wells who  gave to the assembly    A Narrative of the Battle Between the Mormons of  Nauvoo and the Mob    He said: "I will by request give a short account of  affairs in Nauvoo concerning their late difficulties. You have heard   that men were lynched there. We took 15 of the offenders who were sent  to Quincy for a trial and they were let out on bail. The mob then  issued writs against Picb^k^et^t^ Clifford and Furnice. The two latter  went; Picb^k^et^t^ would not. A mob was then raised as a possee  to execute the writs they said. They stayed several weeks to  increase their numbers. They had at first about 300 and increased  to a thousand. The hundred men we had laid in ambush 
 for the mob. ^who^ They cannonaded through the day but did no harm. Next day  they tried the same thing again. We repelled them    On Saturday at 1 o'clock they advanced upon the city  with from a thousand to twelve hundred men. We met them in the name  of God and gained the victory. The action lasted one hour and twenty minutes  They fired 42 cannon balls and we 32 balls. Although the mob were  ten to our one they were defeated and retreated from the battlefield. We  had three killed and none ^2^ wounded. The mob would not acknowledge any  killed but we walked over the battlefield and found a plenty of mob blood  One man not a member of the Church said he saw them put 15 bodies in  one waggon and they were handled like dead ^hogs^ and other waggons were  loaded in the same way. One of the Saints lying in a cellar saw  8 wounded brought to the building each one telling where he was shot  They dug at their entrenchment after the battle. It was supposed  they buried their dead there.    The next day was Sunday. They did  not fire any but we threw some ball and burst one cannon    On Monday the mob sent us a cannon  ball to let us know they had some left and we sent it back again  During the fight the boys would watch the cannon ball strike and  run and get it and bring it to us and we would send it back  again.    On Tuesday a committee was sent to  us to make a treaty but it was rejected by both parties. A Brigade  was then called for but afterwards a treaty was made. We agreed  to surrender the city and leave in five days    On Wednesday evening the treaty was made  and the Saints and the Saints began to pack up their goods and the next day  all goods was removed. As the mob came in we left two blocks  in advance    We met many of the Saints on this side of the  river in distress and it drew tears ^even^ from the eyes of some of the mob  We saw campfires of the mob the same night we left on both 
 sides of the river.    There were scenes transpired in the seige enough to melt  the heart of a stone. The lynching of men when they are labouring for  a living and whipping them until they cannot stand alone as the mob  did was a damnable thing. They made them kneel on a spot where  they said some one was buried and placed them in a position so they  could be whipped easy. An old Revolutioneer was one of them  and he was so beaten by the mob that he has not been able to get  about all summer. I have an old grandfatherâ€”a Revolutioneer  I have thought I would not let him know anything about it but  keep it from him that his feelings might not be harrowed up as  he is about ready to sleep in his grave. But I will say no  more but give way for brother Cutler    Brother Cutler said:    I can bear my testimony that  what brother Wells has said is strictly true. If I were to talk  till sundown the whole could not be told. I have been kept  in Nauvoo by the hand of God. Others wanted to have been  here and would have been had it not been necessary to stop to  save our brethren there who could not get away. I know the hand  of God has been manifest in the salvation of the people in Nauvoo  I thank God I had a hand in the battle. And the hand of God was  so visible in that battle that many who were weak and faltering have been  much strengthened by it and will gather with the Saints. I did not expect  that God would deliver their enemyies into their hands but expected that  He would save them out of the hands of their enemies and this he had  done.    I was sensible we must leave Nauvoo. The time  had come for us to depart. God has called upon us to go and if we  will not he will let the mob loose upon us to drive us out but they  will not get any glory for it but will have to suffer for their wrongs  to the Saints.    I hope the day will come when we shall not 
 have to suffer from mobs but if we had sought to save our lives in this case  by fleeing many would have lost them for but few could have fled; but we  went out in the name of God and conquered. Through the blessing of God we have  done well. One brother put on a sheep bell and went near the camp to  spy out the enemy and they supposed it to be a sheep. The mob do not  acknowledge having any killed but they had a good deal of blood spilled there  they could not cover up which I saw. Captain Smith who was captain  of the guard at the time of the death of Joseph was shot in the neck but  not killed. Another commander of the mob was also shot. Bro Wells  has done well in all places where he has been put in the midst of danger  as well as in safety. With regard to the citizens of Nauvoo there  were but few who stood by us in time of trouble. There are many  spirits in Nauvoo who are like bats ready to join any party that  conquer. If the beast conquer they will show their legs, if   the feathered tribe their wings.    President Young arose and said    I wish to make a few remarks  attached to those which have been made. I will inform the brethren  who have come up that we are that we are glad to see them. Brother  Cutler has been with us before. Brother Wells has been in our society  for several years and I have had considerable acquaintance with  him and I am more than ever satisfied with his course. We have  prayed for our brethren continually. I am sensible that there is  a good deal of suffering there and here but let me say that the Lord God  who has fed us all the day long has His care still over us. When the  Saints are chastized enough it will cease. At least the hand of God  will be visible in their salvation. Some individuals may fall but  the body will be sustained. I have never believed the Lord would  suffer a general massacre of this people by a mob. If ten  thousand men were to come against us if no other way was open the  earth would open and swallow them up. Some say they can stay  in Nauvoo and can live there in perfect peace they ar so righteous 
 There are some who have no better eyes than to say let me live with the  wicked in peace, but thereir blessings will be scarce with the mob and  if they do not leave I fear they will prove a source ^scourge^ in the hands of  God. He works with the wicked by law and when they trespass  upon his rights God is there to maintain them    Many other remarks were made by  President Young.    On the Sunday following during the  intermission of meeting Orson Pratt Amasa Lyman and myself  laid out the city of the camp of Israel named Winter Quarters  into thirteen Wards and appointed a Bishop over each Ward. We  ordained six Bishops    On the Monday we stated on a grapeing  expedition. I took five women in my carriage to pick grapes  On our way we shot three prairie chicken got refreshments at Br  J. Alred cut a road half a mile for my carriage and got on to  the grape ground at dark a distance of 20 miles    At daylight we arose breakfast on  Prairie chicken stew went on to the grape ground and found the grapes  on cottonwoods and willows. I cut down several hundred of them  about the size of my arm and some larger and at sundown we  had picked three barrels of bunch grapes and started home by moon-  light arrived at the camp of Israel quite weary next day and pressed  out about 20 gallons of juice for wine    Another Of My Serious Accidents    Nearly two weeks later October the 15th I took my  axe and went into the wood to cut some board-timber with two  of the brethren. While falling the third tree I steped back  from it several feet but when it fell it shot back of the  stump and bounded and struck me in the breast and knocked  ^me^ several feet into the air against a standing oak and the falling 
 tree caught me against it and I came down crushed between the two trees.  My left thigh and hip were badly brused & my left arm; my breast bone broken  into about 6 inches and three of my ribs of my left side broken and my lungs  and vitals bruised    After the accident I sat down upon a log and  waited until Brother John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse  Notwithstanding I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride  two and half miles over a rough road and my bones being so much broken  every step went through me like an arrow. I rode to Turkey Creek and was  exhausted and was there taken off and carried in a chair home. Elders  Young Kimball Richards and others met me in the street and assisted  me home where I was laid upon my bed exhausted. Here I   laid without being able to move much until my bones knit together  and they began to knit on the 9th day but I was not able to  sit up in my bed until the 1st of November.    On the 4th I was helped out of my waggon and  with the assistance of two persons I was enabled to walk to my tent  and to Sister Benbows waggon where she laid very sick. On this day  our little son Joseph was taken sick ^and^    On the 12th of November    My Son Joseph Died.    As I grew convalescent bour little son declined. He  suffered much from convulsions during his sickness and breathed  his last 15 minutes before six o'clock in the morning and we took  his remains to the grave at 4 in the afternoon. His loss was  a great sacrifice to us    I began to labour once more on the 17th  and during the next two weeks was overwhelmed in business which  was the case with the whole Camp of Israel    I had never seen the Latter-day Saints in  any situation where they seemed to be passing through greater tribulations 
 or wearing out faster than at the present time. After being exposed  to the sufferings of a tedious journey of 10 months in tents and waggons  without houses we were now oblige to build a city of log houses  numbering more than one thousand for the purpose of stopping  in for about three months. We also had to go a great distance  for wood and timber and get it out of deep ravines and  hollows which made it very hard to endure. I was  trying to build a log house for myself and one for my father  and this on the first days of my labour after my serious  accident and broken bones.    Death of Sister Benbow    It will be remembered that brother Benbow who was  a respectable farmer was the first fruits of my extraordinary  mission in Herefordshire and one of my chief helpers. Sister  Benbow had also ministered to my wants and the wants of  my brethren the Twelve in a foreign land and had  done much good. Her husband and her had helped  the Saints to gather ahad gathered with them and had shared  our privations and hardships in the wilderness which  were ended to her by death on the 27th of November  She rested from her labours and her works will follow    On the 3rd of December I assisted  Dr Richards to finish his house eight square framed covered  with puncheon upon which we put fifty loads of dirt  I drew the first load and superintended the building  during the day    December the 8th Mrs Woodruff gave  Birth to A Son whom we called Ezra and he    Died two days afterwards  at half past nine oclock in the evening. We buried 
 him the next day making two sons whom we had laid in the  grave within so short a time.    On this day the main body of the warriors  belonging to the Omaha nation were out on a hunting party and  were surrounded by a party of the Sioux and sixty of the  Omahas were killed. This was a great loss to the Omaha  nation among whom in consequence there was great mourning  and wailing    The Camp of Israel was now devided into streets  blocks and Wards and a Bishop over each to see to the poor and the widows  and to keep an account of what each man was doing. The Twelve High  Council and Bishops met each week to do business and to manage the affairs  of the Church and instruct the Saints in each Ward    There was begining to be murmurings throughout  the Camp of Israel at this time and much wickedness that the Lord was  not pleased with. The Saints appeared like the children of Israel in the  Wilderness and the Nephites on this continent who at times would forget ^their^ God  and turn to wickedness. And while in council on the evening of the 15th  of December the High Council asked President Young for some teaching and  he arose and said that he had no teaching to give at present but to cry  repentance to the people and he would begin with the High Council  They must repent he said and the Camp of Israel must repent or the  Twelve would have to flee out of their midst and go to the Mountains    On the following Sunday I met with my  Ward the 14th for an organization according to the arrangement appointed  and I warned the people to repent before the Lord lest a scourge come  upon them. I was followed by Elders George A Smith and Orson  Pratt and brother Smith reproached the people for their treatment towards  me in not building me an habitation for the Winter as I had been  sick.    We were informed that there was to be a meeting at  the Stand so we dismissed ours and repared to the meeting place where  we found a large congregation assembled and President Young addressing 
 [START HERE] them. The following are some of the words which fell from his lips which  I noted while present  President Young Crying Repentance to the Camp of Israel    He loudly called upon the Camp of Israel to repent and said:  "You must stop your swearing; you must stop your cheating; you   must stop your lying; you must stop your stealing; you must stop  your whoredoms; you must stop your backbitingsâ€”speaking evil of the   Twelve speaking evil of meâ€”you must stop these things and put away  your wickedness or you will be damned; you will be destroyed; you will   be visited by pestilence and plague and by the sword and you will fall   to the ground and I warn you and foreworn you of these things if you   do not repent. Yes councillors High Priests and Elders here in   the camp of Israel will say I will be damned if I pay my tithing or  if i will do this or that.    If God was like man he would hurl you down   to hell and let you lie and welter there a thousand years and his mercy  only keeps you out    There are many here who are corrupt and  rotten at the core and I have no more fellowship for them than I have  for John C. Bennett. If I fellowship these things it will drag me   down to hell with you and I will not do it. Brother Joseph being   a very merciful man bore with these things until it took his life   but I will not do it. Men get led away by degrees until the devil  gets possession of their tabernacles and they are led captive at the will of the  devil    And now I say that these who are calculating  to continue in wickedness and serve the devil had better go no further   with this camp. They had better go to Missouri and spend the   rest of the time with the gentiles; for I can swear to them if they  go with us and continue their wickedness their heads shall be 
 severed from their tabernacles and the devils that are in them shall have no tabernacles  to dwell in    The truth of the matter is there are many places which  we pass through that have been the slaughterin ground of the ancient Nephites  and Lamanites and the spirits of devils are hovering around it and if  you are not on your guard they will enter you and lead you captive at their  will; for if you are not governed by the Spirit of God you will be by the  spirit of the devil. If you are governed by the Spirit of God while in  such places and they cannot enter you ^any of you^ they will try to enter your cattle  your beast for they want to enter some tabernacle as they did the swine in  ancient days    I had rather go to the Mountains with the  Twelve alone and not to have another soul with us than to have those who  will not be subject to the Priesthood but practice wickedness and  serve the devil for if we continue with this company and they do not  repent the righteous will fall with the wicked    There are people in this camp who are stealing  hay and wood and I know who they are. Will I fellowship them?  No I will not; and because we know who is guilty of wickedness they think  we are fellowshiping them and doing the same ourselves but it is not  so. Joseph suffered much from the same cause. Because he  knew of the rascality and wickedness his enemies and many of the  Saints thought he was guilty of it himself. The truth of the matter  is those who are leading the house of Israel while in the path of their  duty know the wickedness that is among the people. It cannot  be hid from them for they are in vision all the time    I will now look a little upon the other  side of the question. I will say however that if we have a  mind to be subject to the will of the Devil Death Hell and the  graveâ€”we may be and bow down to it all the day long or  we may have perfect power and triumph over it    Who am I surrounded by? By men  who have entered into covenant with God who have received endowments in 
 the temple and are called to be saviours upon Mount Zion. To save what  Our Fathers and Israel clear back to Fallen Adam who are still lying in  their graves and waiting for the redemption of their bodies through your  instrumentality. Then will you curse sware lie steal commit  adultery and take the name of God in vain? Pretty saviours you  would be. O shame! God and angels would blush at such  conduct. Then repent and do the work appointed you. Many  are overtaken in fault who desire to repent and turn to God. Shall  we cast such away. Nay; but bear with them as God bears with  us. We cannot be sanctified all at once but have to  be tried and placed in all kinds of shapes and proven to the utmost  to see whether we will serve the Lord unto the end so that we may  be safe when we come into the Kingdom of God and not do as  Lucifer did the first time an opportunity is offeredâ€”rebel against  God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled down to hell in a  manner that you could not be redeemed at all    You must not sin murmur and complain  while in the midst of your trials because you have been mobbed  and tried even to the utmost. It is no excuse for you to commit  a wicked deed, take the name of God in vain or do any evil.  Now all of you forsake it. Repent and turn to God and you  shall be blessed.    Notwithstanding I have thus reproved  you I consider you the best people as a body on the earth and  if there were any better I would go to them and take you with  them who desired to go    In speaking of the redemption of our dead  I would say that there are millions who have died from the days  of Adam to Christ who weare waiting for their bodies to be raised  In comparason to the number but few arose at the resurrection  of Christ and they were some who had the Priesthood or fulness  of it sealed upon them."    President Young made many other 
 useful remarks band closed by blessing the people believing they would repent  and what was said made a deep impression upon the congregation.    Statistics  of the   Number of the  Camp of Israel in Winter Quarters.  on the 20th if Dec. 1846.    The following is a true report:  Total number of souls...... 3483  Sick persons ...... 334  Well men ...... 502  Sick men ......117  Absent men ......138  Policemen ...... 19  Women whose husbands were in the Mormon Batallion of   the United States Army ...... 53  Widows ...... 75  Waggons in Camp 814; Horses 145; Mules 29; Yokes  of oxen 388 1/2; Cows 463; cords of wood drawn 83 3/4  Number of days spent by the camp in building a Mill Race 561 1/4    I spent the 21st in drawing logs for a Council House  and the next day in assisting the twelve in laying its foundation  It was to be built of large logs 32 by 22    I was quite unwell the following   day yet I went into the woods with Father and chopped 3 loads of  wood and brought home two loads of it    Christmas Day  The dawn was saluted in the camp of Israel by the firing of 
 cannon from the hills by the artilery. I met in Council with the Twelve  and spent a portion of the two following days also with them in council  and during the following day worked on the Council House and two of  the last days of the year I spent in cutting and drawing wood and  hay for the Winter    Organizing the Pioneers    On the 29th the Quorum of the Twelve sat in  Council to consider the subject of organizing a pioneer company to go forward  and put in crops in the Spring and prepare the way for the camp  of Israel and also to make preparations for the moving of the  camp. The forepart of the evening was occupied in  conversing upon a variety of matters. There was an intermission during  which time a little recreation was taken. Prayers were afterwards  had and President Young and Kimball spoke in tongues awhile. We  then went into council and our final dicission was that we fit out  a pioneer company and follow them as soon as grass grows  the pioneer company to go this Winter as far as they could go  on rushes and brows[e] then as far as they could on grass until it  was time to put in their corn crop. This was the last  important action of the Quorum of the Twelve during the year  eighteen hundred and forty six.    Synopsis  of the  Travels and Labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1846    I travelled seven thousand four hundred and thirty six miles  Councils  I attended 31 councils with my quorum of the Twelve and two  with Indian chiefs. 
 Ordinations &c    I ordained 9 Bishops baptized 6 persons and administered to fifty  six of the sick.    Meetings Held &c    I held 26 meetings wrote 70 letters and received 56    Summary of the Year    During the year 1846 my time had not been occupied in  preaching in the vineyard and building up churches. I felt the field  of my labours in Liverpool at the office and in the British Mission  in general at the beginning of this year. Since then I had  crossed the Atlantic and travelled the bredth of the United States  gathered my father stepmother and cousin to Nauvoo with me  I arrived in Nauvoo on the 13th of April after a severely tiresome  long and dangerous passage in which the storms were so constant  and tremendous that I saw not a fire on ship board for the  space of 30 days. On my arrival in the city of the  Saints where I joined my wife and children who had only reached home  a few days before me I found that President Young and the Twelve  had led out the camp of Israel into the wilderness and without a  moments rest after my return I gathered up my friends and a company  of Saints from the Gentiles and joined the camp of Israel in  their journeyings to the wilderness and passed through all the trials  privations labours and sufferings attendent on such a journey; and  in spite of my severe accident and broken bones late in the year I built  my own house helped the building of others cut down and drew my wood  and hay and generally assisted with the Twelve in establishing  Winter Quarters. Thus ended the year with the cares of the  Twelve daily increasing 
 1847    At the beginning of the year I looked over and  arranged my journals and the following is    A Summary of My History for the Last 13 Years    Since 1834 I had travelled sixty one thousand six hundred and  ninety two miles crossed the Atlantic four times travelled ^several times^ through  England Scotland and Wales and on six Islands of the Sea through twenty  of the United States and the Canadias held one thousand and sixty  nine meetings led eighty six conference and one hundred and  twenty three councils. I baptized 634 persons and assisted  in the baptism of hundreds of others was baptized for 36 dead  friends confirmed 813 ordained 2 Patriarchs 9 Bishops 3 High  Priests 3 Seventies 156 Elders 142 Priests 63 Teachers and 13 Deacons  and assisted the Twelve in ordaining about 200 Seventies and  Elders at one time in Nauvoo not recorded in my journal or enumerated  in the above. I had administered by annointing and  laying on of hands unto 364 six persons many of whom were healed 
 blessed 194 children married 7 couple planted 51 churches established 77  preaching places & had 10 mobs rise against me. I recorded 30 of  the Prophet Joseph's sermons and 25 of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles  I wrote 1040 letters received 699. I collected for the building of  the Temple of the Lord in Kirtland Nauvoo 1674 dollars also 5000  dollars for assisting in the printing of the works of the Latter-day Saints  I procured 205 subscribers for the periodicals published by the Saints  I printed the "Times and Seasons" and "Neighbour" in connection with Elder  Taylor for two years and I printed 2500 copies of the Millenial Star  at Liverpool and published 3000 copies of the Book of Doctrines and  Covenants and secured the copyright of it at Stationers Hall London  printed 3000 Hymn Books and 20,000 of the Proclamation called  the Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles.    During this above period I was ordained to the  office of Teacher Priest Elder member of the second quorum of the  Seventies first quorum of the Seventies and one of the Twelve  Apostles; received my anointing sealing and endowments from  and under the hands of Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball  by order of Joseph the Prophet.    There were many things of interest transpiring  in the councils of the Twelve held in the beginning of the year 1847  which I did not write in my journal as Elder Willard Richards  was present. He was the Recorder and Historian of the Church  and wrote of these councils which will be found in the General  Church History    On the 14th of January in a council of the  Twelve at which I was present at Elder Heber C. Kimball's a revelation  was given concerning the organization of the Camp of Israel for  the time had come when it had to be organized according to the  order and law of God for the peace safety and salvation of  the people. 
 A True Copy of A Revelation  given at  Winter Quarters at Elder Kimball's  Jan 14 1847    "The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp  of Israel in their journeyings to the West"    "Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-Day Saints and those who journey with them be organized  into companies with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments  and statutes of the Lord our God. Let the companies be organized with  captains of hundreds captains of fifties and captains of tens with a  president and his two counsellors at this head under the direction of  the Twelve Apostles: And this shall be our covenant that we will  walk in all the ordinances of the Lord.    Let each company provide themselves  with all the teams waggons provissions clothing and other necessaries  for the journey that they can. When the companies are organized  let them go to with their might to prepare for those who are to  tarry. Let each company with their captains and presidents  decide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient  number of able bodied and expert men to take teams seeds and farming  utensils to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in Spring crops.  Let each company bear an equal proportion according to the dividend of  their property in taking the poor the widows the fatherless and the  families of those who have gone into the army that the crys of the  widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord  against this people    Let each company prepare houses and fields  for raising grain for those who are to remain behind this season 
 and this is the will of the Lord concerning His people. Let every man    Let every man use all his influence and property to  remove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion:  and if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness ye shall be blessed:  you shall be blessed in your flocks and in your lands and in your  fields and in your houses and in your families.    Let my servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus  Snow organize a company and let my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford  Woodruff organize a company also let my servants Amasa Lyman  and George A Smith organize a company and appoint presidents  and captains of Hundreds and of Fifties and of Tens: and let my  servants that have been appointed go and teach this my will to  the Saints that they may be ready to go to a land of peace.  Go thy way and do as I have told you and fear not thine enemies  for they shall not have power to stop my work.    Zion shall be redeemed in my own due time  and if any man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my  counsel he shall have no power and his folly shall be made manifest  Seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covent not that  which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evil to take  not the name of thy God in vain; for I am the Lord your God  even the God of your fathers the God of Abraham and of Isaac  and of Jacob. I am he who led the children of Israel  out of the Land of Egypt and my arm is stretched out in the  last days to save my people Israel    Cease to contend one with another  cease to speak evil one of another cease drunkeness and let your  words tend to edifying one another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbour  thou shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed and if thou canst  not repay then go straight way and tell thy neighbour lest he  condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbour  has lost thou shalt make dilligent search till thou shalt deliver  it to him again 
 Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast that  thou mayest be a wise steward for it is the free gift of the Lord thy  God and thou art His steward.    If thou art merry praise the Lord with  singing with music with dancing and with a prayer of praise and  thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on the Lord thy  God with supplication that your souls may be joyful. Fear  not thine enemies for they are in mine hands and I will  do my pleasure with them. My people must be tried  in all things that they may be prepared to receive the Glory  that I have for them even the glory of Zion and he that will  not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom    Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom  by humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God that his  eyes may be opened that he may see and his ears opened that he  may hear; for my spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten  the humble and contrite and to the condemnation of the ungodly    Thy brethren have rejected you and your  testimony even the nation that has driven you out and now  cometh the day of their calamity even the days of sorrow-like  a woman that is taken in travalil and their sorrows shall be  great unless they speedily repent yea very speedily for they  killed the Prophets and they that were sent unto them and they  have shed inocent blood which criseth from the ground  against them. Therefore marvel not at those things  for ye are not yet pure:  Thou canst not yet bear  my glory but thou shalt behold it if ye are faithful in  keeping all my words that I have given you from the days  of Adam to Abraham from Abraham to Moses from Moses  to Jesus and the Apostles and from Jesus and his Apostles  to Joseph ^Smith^ whom I did call upon by mine angels my  ministering servants and by mine own voice out of the  heavens to bring forth my work which foundation he  [pencil beneath - the foundation of which] 
 did lay and was faithful and I took him to myself. Many have marvelled  because of his death; but it was needful that he should seal his testimony with  his blood that he might be honoured and the wicked might be condemned    Have I not delivered you from your enemies,  only in that I have left a witness of my name? Now therefore hearken  O ye people of my Church and ye Elders listen together. You have received  my kingdom; be diligent in keeping all my commandments lest  judgement come upon you and your faith fail you and your enemies  triumph over you.    So no more at present: Amen and Amen." 
 Feb    On the 15th I met in Council with the Presidents and Counsellors  captains of hundreds Fifties and Tens to farther the organization of the camp of  Israel: I received an appointment to go to Kegg Creek with brother Smoot  to organize the people there    Next day was a very interesting day to me. I  attended the family meeting of President Brigham Young and he addressed  the meeting at great length during the day and evening. There were  present of the quorum of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball  Willard Richards Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A Smith Amasa  Lyman and Ezra T. Benson.    After singing and prayer by President Young  he arose and addressed the meeting and remarked that he had invited  the Twelve to be present though they were not of his family yet he  wished them to act free and speak such things as the Lord shall give  them. He said, "Let me state a principle by which you may  contemplate much. For the word of understanding many have  suffered jealousies to arise which afflicted their minds with  borrowed troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some  others more than themselves. This I have seen in the  Church ever since its rise. It was manifest in Kirtland. When  the first Bishop was ordained. This jealous feeling was manifest  Some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them to ordain them  a Bishop. Father Morley and others who were present can bear  record of this fact And when the Twelve were chosen the same  feeling existed and in fact I will not except all of them some of whom  manifested the same feelings when the Bishops were ordained. This  Spirit has been the overthrow of many in this Church and in fact  upon this principle thousands have fallen in all ages    The Lord gives to every man all the power  influence and authority he can wield in righteousness and all that his  goodness and faithfulness merits. Then why should jealousies  arise or what benefit can come by suffering such feelings to exist  Non at all; but he who cherishes such feelings commences trying 
 to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining influence as Cain did  instead of building up and nourishing every tree and thereby proving  himself worthy and showing to his brethren and to God that he loves  the cause and by his pasive spirit that he is not only willing  that offers should prosper and gain influence but that he actually  loves to see them prosper; for then he does all that he can through  himself if he helps to advance it through others although they receive   the honour of it and he still be aware of it. [##Genesis 4:1-16##] Such a man will never be  forgotten and to his honour and glory and exaltation there shall be  no end.    There is another principle that has  caused considerable uneasiness and trouble and that is the idea of  some men having more wives than one. Such tremendious  fears take hold of some that they hardly know how to live:  still they can't die. They began to whisper and talk around: "I am  actually affraid to go on a mission for fear some man will be sealed  to my wife"; and when they return some will be babling about  "You don't know but what you have got another man's wife" and  they are affraid to speak to a young woman for fear that she belongs  to some one else or for fear some one else wants her. Others deny  the faith as they think (but they never had much) and say that it is  all of the devil. To Such foolishness ought not to be cherished among  a wise and prudent people.    Admiting the Lord created the same number  of woman as men at the beginning and commanded them to multiply  and replenish the earth and to fill up the measure of their creator in  righteousness the question is did they do it? Answer: No. They  soon disobeyed every commandment and plunged themselves into  wickedness and rendered themselves unworthy to raise up seed  unto the Lord and in fact used ever means in their power  to cut off life and hindering women answering the end for which  they were created. Nine tenths of them would rebel against  the very thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the 
 Lord calling upon men who hears the Pristhood to take to themselves wives from among  the daughters of men and raise up a righteous seed unto him that He might fill  up the measure of their creation and hasten the consummation of his purposes  in righteousness in this dispensation according to His word previously spoken  through His servants the Prophets.    Those who suffer fears and jealousies to arise  in their bosoms either back right out or get to be mighty righteous and for fear  they are sleeping with other men's wives they kick up a dust or broil at home  and perhaps abuse their own companion through jealousy then go off to  some woman that does not understand what is right or wrong and tell her  that she cannot be saved without a man and he has almighty power  and can exalt and save her and likely tell that there is no harm for them  to sleep together before they are sealed and then go to some dough-head  of an Elder and get him to say the ceremony and all done without the  knowledge of the Authority of this Church. This is not right  and will not be suffered. The God I serve will reward every man  openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly and  privately proclaiming himself in the creativity of ignorant inocent  females.    Such jealousies do exist and were I to say  to the Elders you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one  half of them would lie swear steal and fight like the very devil to get  men and women sealed to them. They would even try to pass  right by me and go to Joseph thinking to get between him and  the Twelve. Some have already tried to use and influence  against me but such jealousies and selfishness shall be stoped and  if the brethren do not stop it I will blow it to the four winds  by making them all come and be sealed to me and I to my father  and he and all this Church to Joseph    When I go astray and give wrong counsel  and lead this people astray then is time enough to pull me  down and then God will remove me as He has done all others  who have turned from the faith. 
 But to return. I have gathered a number of families  around me by the law of adoption and seal of the covenant according to the  order of the Priesthood and others have done likewise it being the  means of salvation left to bring us back to God. But had the keys  of the Priesthood been retained and handed down from father to  son throughout all generations up to the present time then there  would have been no necessity of the law of adoption for  we would have all been included in the covenant without  it and have been legal heirs instead of being heirs according  to promise.    The Priesthood is eternal; without  begining of days or end of life as the Apostle has expressed  it; but man through apostacy which is entire disobedience  has lost or suffered the keys and privileges of the Priesthood  to be taken away from them and left to wander in darkness  and practise all manner of wickedness until thousands  became the vessels of wrath and were doomed to destruction  for as long as men are without the Priesthood They continue  to be without God and never retrace their steps until it is  done by the Priesthood. The idea of the Saint being  led by false Prophets is just a notion according to the light  in which they view them. All the false Prophets we  have are the men who have turned away from the truth.    The man is the head and god of the  woman but let him act like God in virtuous principles and  Godlike conversation walk and department. Such men will continue  to gain influence and power and advance in glory to all eternity  But should they use their power in wickedness as a tyrant they will soon  be called to render an account of their stewardship. If not  found worthy they will be hurled down to perdition and their  family and kingdom be given to another that is worthy. Some  say that a woman cannot be saved without a man: neither can   a man without a woman. 
 Brother Joseph said he had taught the Twelve all he knew  concerning the order of the kingdom but the difficulty was they could not  remember it as he told them but when it was necessary they would  not be at a loss for understanding. And I bear record of the truth  of his word before God this day that I always had an understanding and  everything was brought them to my mind just as he taught them ^it^ to  us. All the ordinances of the Temple and building of the altar &c  came to me just right when they were to be attended to and could we  now know brother Hyde Pratt and Taylors feelings you would say  that they could read a man through as soon as they cast their eyes upon  him.    The Apostle Paul while speaking of the Fathers  and the ancients said that they without us could not be made perfect. [##Hebrews 11:40##]  There was a lack in his story and still will be to all eternity until  the chain of that Priesthood is restored and every spirit take a tabernacle  that was forordained according to the dispensation of the will of God.    I am entitled to the keys of the Priesthood  according to linage and blood. So is brother Heber C. Kimball  and many othersâ€”and have taken ^the various^ kingly power and grades   of the Priesthood. This we would have taught in the Temple  had time permitted. Joseph Smith was entitled to the keys  of the Priesthood according to blood. Still he was the fourth son.  But when we get another Temple built then we will teach you  concerning these things. Suffice it to say that I will extend  the chain of the Priesthood back through the Apostlolic Dispensation  to Father Adam just as soon as I can get a Temple built.    Jesus could have restored the order of   the Priesthood in his day and brought in the Millenium if the  people would have hearkened to his instructions but they rebelled and  would not and it was for this cause that Jesus told them  that all the blood which had been shed from righteous  Abel down to Zachariel the Prophet should be required  at their hands. [##Matthew 23:34-35##] 
 I have a request to make of my family and that  is that they (especially old people omit calling me their father.  Call me Brother Brigham. I shall fell better when yo[u] do  for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation. Father  in the Priesthood implies the great Head. The term would be  proper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference to the same  thing when he told his disciples not to call any man father  on earth for their Father was in heaven.    The seal of the covenant that I  have been speaking of to day was what the Apostle saw  previous to the destruction of the wicked when the angel  was commanded not to pour out the viall of wrath upon the  wicked until the Saints were sealed in their foreheads  and when this was done they all became Father Adam's  family.    Those that ^belong to^ are adopted into my family  and take me for their Councillor if I continue faithful I  will preside over them throughout all eternity. I will  stand at their head and Joseph will stand at the head  of this Church and will be the President & Prophet and God  to the people in this dispensation.    When we locate I will settle  my family down in the order and teach them their duty.  They will then have to provide temporal blessings for  me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as  I now do. I will administer in spiritual blessings  to them. I expect to live in the House of the  Lord and receive and administer ordinances to my brethren  and for the dead all the year round."    President H.C. Kimball and Orson  Pratt then address briefly President Young's family  meeting and then there was an intermission until 
 after supper.    The table was will furnished and supplied.  Forty persons could be seated at the table at a time. The men  were seated to the right with their companions opposite to them  commencing with the Twelve President Young at their head; then in order  the ^rest^ adopted children begining with the 1st that was adopted. The  band and choir kept their seats and discoursed their sweet strain of  music while the guest were partaking of the rich festival.    While at table brother Thomas Wolsley  and John H Tippetts came in. They were direct from the  Mormon Battalion 280 miles south of Santa Fe on the river  Rio Grande on the 10th of Nov. 1846. they had piloted fifty six  sick men to Fort Pueblo where Cap Brown's estableshment was  stationed. From thence they came in on packmules were  50 days on the way and were taken prisoners twice by the  Indians and once was sentenced to death by the Pawnees. For  thirty days they were without bread and five days were without  much of anything to eat. These brethren brought a package  of 137 letters and a good account from Fort Pueblo but rather  unfavorable from the Battalion who were described as resembling  mountineers in their persons.    The arrived of these brethren in the  camp produced no small stir. Men and women came from  all directions to enquire after their friends in the army.    After the men were refreshed we went  into council with them and they rehearsed the salvation of the Battalion.  The brethren composing it had been on half rations for three weeks  when they left them and no prespects of more than half rations  should they attempt to cross the mountains that Winter. Report  however had reached Santa Fe when they arrived that the  Battalion had taken the Alpasio a strong hold between the  Rio Grande and the Mountains without the firing of a gun  President Young said that if they had hearkened to his counsel 
 not a man of them would have fallen but would all have returned to their  friends in perfect safety.    We returned to the Council House at 7 o'clock.  The Saints were rejoicing in what they had heard that day and after Elder  Isaac Morley had expressed himself upon the occassion President Young  arose and continued his remarks upon the Law of adoption.    "The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the  benefit of the children of men as a schoolmaster to bring them back  into the covenant of the Priesthood. This principle I am  aware is not clearly understood by many ^of the^ Elders in this church  at the present time as it will hereafter be: and I confess that  I have only a smattering of those things; but when it is  necessary I will attain to more knowledge upon the subject  and consequently shall be enabled to teach and practice more.  In the mean time glorify God the bountiful Giver.    I have heard Elders say they were  not dependant upon any man. It was saying more than  I can say for I consider that we are all dependant one  upon another for our exaltation and that our interest is  inseperably connected. For example: What can my family  do without me. Supposing they were to all turn away  from me. I hold the keys over them through which they are to receive  their exaltation. Would they not be like sheep without a shepherd?  and be devoured by the wolves? They certainly would. Then  let us change the position and say that I would cut off all my  family then what glory would I have with no body to rule over  but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings  I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation.    This is another proof of the Apostle's  saying when he declared that they without us could not be made  perfect. Neither can you without me nor I without  you that is to say if we are faithful for without faithfullness 
 there is no perfection on any consideration.    This rule applies to the whole human family.  This is the torment and misery of the disobedient spirits that they cannot  be made perfect unless some scheme should hereafter be introduced  for their redemption.    They are now without tabernacles to dwell in  only such as they have taken possession of unlawfully and usurped  power over. It is a part of their agency that was allowed them which  they use to the consummation of their unhappy and wretched estate it  being the reward and fruits of their doings having been given over to  all manner of wickedness and permitted to afflict the handy work of the  Lord until they fill up the cup of their iniquity. Then the Lord  will say unto them, "Thou wicked and disobedient spirit thou  shalt not have power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the works  of my hands: you have forfeited your agency and wrought your fulness;  depart hence to the pit that I have prepared for thee.    This is their torment that their power  and agency is taken from them and they are left to regret that it  was through their own disobedience they cut the thread of their own  salvation. This reflection only serves to torture and  increase their torment.    And this would be the situation of my  family were they to cut themselves off from me. I use my family  as an example not that I have the least fears, of their ever doing  so, for I have none.    I feel happy this night because we are  of one mind. Still should I believe that we were perfect and  could not advance any farther I should not be happy. But to  the honour power and glory of the faithful there is no end.    For your satisfaction I will show you  a rule by which you may comprehend the exaltation of the  faithful. I will use myself as a figure and say that I am  ruling over ten sons or subjects and soon each of them would have 
 ten more sealed to them and they would be rulers over them and that  would make me ruler over ten Presidents or kings whereas I was ruler  over ten subjects only: or in other words I ruled over one kingdom  but now I should rule over ten. Then let each get ten more  then I should be ruler over one hundred kingdoms and so on continued  to all eternity. The more honour and glory that I could  bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my exaltation  but to clip the thread of your exaltation then where would be  your glory? It would be like the fallen angels or devils  that kept not their first estate but were reserved in  everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgement of the  great day. Others fell from heaven were thrust down  to hell. But if you wish to advance hold up the  hands of your file leader. Should you have ten legions  of trains following on after you, you should say to  your file leader push ahead for I am coming with  my train lifting him up at the same time instead of  trying to pass by him. This would stimulate   him and he would say come on my boys I will travel  as fast as you can and on we would go in one solid  train to all eternity.    Before I close I will answer one  question that has been asked me repeatedly. Should I have  a father dead who has never heard this gosepl would  it be required of me to redeem him and have him adopted  into some man's family and I be adopted unto my father  I answer no.    If we have to attend to the ordinances  of redemption for our dead relatives we then become their  saviors and were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives  before we could link the chain of the Priesthood we would never  accomplish it."    Many other remarks were made 
 and at the close there was a little exercise by music and dancing another  meeting was dismissed.    Brother Smoot and myself left Winter quarters  on the 18th on our mission to Keg Creek. We rode to Council  Point the first day where we found that Branch assembled for meeting  We addressed the meeting and I read the revelation given at Winter  Quarters and took a note upon it.    Next day we travelled to Miskitoe  Creek and on the following one we visited the Branch of  the Church in that place and organized it according to the pattern  given. We then drove our team to Keg Creek. There was  a snow storm during the day and our horses suffered  much on the journey in the storm.    On the Sunday I met with the Branch  at Keg Creek and addressed the congregation in much plainness  and rebuked some false spirits and was followed by Elder  Smoot. We took the names for organizing and rode  twelve miles back to brother Petty's and spent the night. We had  about 2 feet of snow to travel through.    Next day was very cold but we travelled  30 miles through the snow to Winter Quarters.    During the next ten days I met several  times with the 1st Division and captains of hundreds in furthering  the organization and its design and again on the 4th of March  met in council with the first division and several speeches were  made by several of the brethren concerning our location in  Winter Quarters & our journey westward. President Young  said he should go as he was directed by the Lord and  he requested The Saints to be ready to start on the 15th.    On Sunday the 11th I met with the  Saints in our Ward. Bishop Smoot addressed the people  I followed and required the people who had means to carry  something to the Bishop for the poor and after meetings I 
 went home and took for my part flour meal sugar and coffee for  that object to the Bishop and then myself and brother Smoot  and I myself took of the substance donated for the poor and visited  the sick and administered to them spiritually and temporally.    About this time brothers McCray and  Lummeroux arrived in camp from Nauvoo. McCray  had been in prison and many of the brethren had been imprisoned  and some hung by the mob until they were nearly dead.    I spent the 12th in preparing my  carriage to go with the Pioneer Company and spent the  next day in council with the Twelve and captains of  Hundreds for adopting measures for the government of the  people after we left.    The 15th was spent in Council with  the Twelve and Captains of Hundreds upon the movement  before us and the meeting was addressed by President Young  and a number of others.    The next two days wasere occupied in  preparing for our journey; and on the following one I was  unwell but attended a musical concert in the Council House  in the evening though I had to return home and go to  bed being so ill.    I was somewhat better two days  later and continued preparing for the Pioneer journey, This  and attended the funeral of sister Phebe Traine. There was at  this time much sickness and death in the camp.    Sunday the 21st the camp of Israel  assembled in a general meeting on the public square, President  Young addressed the congregation upon a variety of subjects.  We also met in Council but not much business was done.  There was a severe snow storm during the night.    The next morning was very cold; but  there was a meeting of the Presidency and captains of company's 
 and it was resolved to stockade the city of Winter Quarters and for the Twelve  to go forward to pick out a resting place for the Saints. In the  evening I attended a council of the Bishops and Twelve; and a variety of  subjects was brought up.    President Young spoke upon Patriarchal  blessings and the blessing of children and said that any father  who held the Priesthood was a Patriarch to his own family and  when he blessed his children it was a Patriarchal blessing. If  a man wrote the blessing of his children and could get the  Historian to record it that was all right enough but the Historian  could not write all the blessings in the Church.    Next day the Presidency and Bishops  met to decide where the lines of the city should be and two days  later the Camp of Israel held a public meeting.    In the evening I met with my company  and expressed my feelings to them concerning labouring together  for the season in raising grain and taking care of the familes  of those who were going in the Pioneer company. The  spirit of union prevailed in the matter.    On the 27 I attended the funeral of  sister Burnham and took the family to the grave and then returned  and let George A. Smith have my team to go to the grave to  bury one of his family.    The Sacrament for the First Time in Winter Quarters.    Sunday the 28th was a fine day and the  camp met at the public stand and in the morning brothers  Young Kimbal Pratt and Benson addressed the meeting.    In the afternoon we partook of the  sacrament and the assembly was addressed by Elder Woodruff  Smith Lyman Willard Richards Phelps and President Young. This  was the first time the sacrament had been administered 
 to the Saints in a general Assembly in Winter Quarters.    In the evening I visited the sick and  administered to five persons and met with the Twelve High Council  and Bishops.    Next morning I met with the Presidency  Captains of Hundreds and Pioneer Company and it was  finally agreed that those who were ready should start on the morrow for the  Horn. It was fine weather.    On the evening of the last of the month  I was with the Presidency and Captains of Hundreds in Council and  expressed my mind with others upon the subject of ^stockading^ barracading  the city and uniting together in labour in cultivating the earth.  President Young spoke upon the subject.    As the close of this Council the  quorum of the Twelve met and resolved that Brother W.W. Phelps  go to the East and procure a Printing Press and type and  receive a recommendation to that effect.    On the 1st of April I sat for a  likeness to be taken by Major to be put into a plate with  others of the Twelve. In the afternoon I met in council with  the Twelve. Elder Stratton who had just arrived from  St Louis was present and gave an account of the affairs of  the Church in that city. We received a mail of papers  containing the war news &c which we read with great  interest in our isolated life.    On the 2nd a portion of the Pioneers  commenced removing the out houses ^on the outskirts^ unto a line in the  city. I spent a part of the day in the office reading the  news and a part in writing in my Journal and an epistle  to my family and capatains of my company giving an  account of my affairs which I was leaving behind. 
 The following was a busy day in preparing for our  journey. The Pioneers were now about to start to go to the Mountains  of Israel to find a location and a resting place for the Saints while the  judgements of God are poured out upon the earth. The burden and  cares of the Church and my family rested heavily upon my mind and  I never felt more in leaving my family to go on a mission than  now but I prayed that the Lord would sustain them as he had done  in the many missions which I had taken. I assisted brother Richards  in the evening to pack up his waggon.    Next day was Sunday and I went to the  river and baptised 3 persons members brother Dewey's family and  I also confirmed them.    Our Annual Conference  at  Winter Quarters  April the 6th 1847    As usual the Church held its annual conference on  the anniversary of the organization of Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-Day Saints on the 6th of April 1830. This  year it was held at Winter Quarters where the body of  the Church had located for the season on its way to the  Rocky Mountains to find at new home.    It was a fine morning; the sun  shone brightly the Heavens smiled upon us and our hearts  were made glad. There was not much business done.  President Young addressed the Assembly with good sound  doctrine and the Conference voted to sustain the quorum  of the Twelve and the rest of the quorums and authorities  of the Church.    I spent the afternoon in preparing to start  for the Rocky Mountains on the morrow. 
 The Pioneers  Leaving Winter Quarters  April 7th 1847    The day after the General Conference I took  leave of my family and friends and started with my company  of Pioneer waggons 8 in number and left Winter Quarters for  our journey to the Mountains to select a location for the  Church and prepare for the body of the Saints to follow.    When we were on the top of the  ridge west of the city I took a view of the city and looked  at my wife and children though my glass. I then led  the company to the old camp ground from thence on the  Punkaw road about 7 miles and camped for the night, ten  miles from Winter Quarters.    We had excellent stables for our  horses in a valley near a small stream of water. We  had not been camped long before Brother Pratt and his  company arrived and close upon them President Young and  his Company so we all camped together about 25 waggons  of us and it was a very windy night.    In the morning we arose and took  breakfast. A squirel was killed and it being the first  game killed by the Pioneer Companies I moved that the  first fruits of the game be offered to the Priest: so it was  presented to President Young for his breakfast.    President Young Father Morley and others  went to the old camping ground to pick them out a place for  a farm and I with several others spent the day in hunting  could but caught nothing but weary limbs and wet feet. We saw  however deer geese ducks &c. 
 Commence here    When I returned to camp in the evening from our  unsuccessful hunting expedition I learned that Parley P. Pratt had arrived  at Winter Quarters from his mission to England, and that President Young  Orson Pratt and others had gone back to the city to see him.    In the morning I mounted my horse  and started for Winter Quarters to see brother Parley the Twelve my  family and others. Mrs Woodruff was at our camp the day before  while I was out hunting and left a letter for me in answer to the  one I had written to her.    Before I got to the city I met the  Twelve. I was within half a mile of home yet I turned about  with them returned to the camp of pioneers harnessed our  horses and drove until dark 10 miles towards the Horn leaving  brothers Young and Kimball several miles behind.    Early the next morning we started  drove to the Horn and crossed it with all ^our^ teams ^on a raft^ before sunset.    The following was Sunday. We crossed  over 20 waggons in the morning and then Presidents Young  and Kimball arrived with their companions and we  continued to ferry them until they were all over. We moved  down our encampment 2 miles and spent the night.    Next day the encampment moved up the   Platte 14 miles; but the quorum of the Twelve and others recrossed  the Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. Four of us followed  an Indian trail and cut off 15 miles. It was 35 miles by the  waggon route but only 20 the way we went.    I was very busy the next day painting  one of my waggons to take away and sell. I got another horse  to take away with me and was in council with the quorum  of the Twelve until midnight. Elder John Taylor was with  us. He arrived in the city in the evening on this return  from England. We were all glad to meet him once more.  He brought for our use on this Pioneer journey two Sextants 
 two baromaters two artificial horizons one circle of reflection  and one telescope, all of which were exhibited to us in the  evening and boxed up so that we could take them along.    Next day I called together my family  and blessed my wife and children and left them in the  hands of the Lord. I bade farewell to Father Woodruff  and family and all around me and took my leave  of Winter Quarters and in company with Elders O Pratt  A. Lyman G. A Smith E. Snow and others we again  took the Indian trail and rode through the Prairie to  Elk Horn and went over on a raft and camped two miles  below the Ferry. We had an excellent supper of  fried catfish pork beans short-cake honeycomb coffee  milk &c. We all eat very hearty. had prayers & retired to bed.    Professor O Pratt the next morning  took an observation for the correct time. Brothers Young  Kimball and Whitney and others came and crossed the ferry  and we all moved up to the general camp on the Platte  River 9 miles in advance of us. We found the camp  very busy in blacksmith work preparing to ^continue^ contue our  journey.    Brother Jesse C. Little arrived from  the Eastern States in our midst. Finding us not at  Winter Quarters he followed and overtook us this evening. He  gave us news of the Eastern Churches and brought a remembrance  to the quorum of the Twelve from our friend Col. Kane  in a variety of presents to us. The Col. had sent me a  patent life preserver and a stop-compass.    Brothers Little Rockwell and Reading  returned to Winter Quarters next morning and the camp continued  4 miles up the Platte.    Before we left this morning the camp  came together and was organised the for journeying as a military 
 as a military body into companies of hundreds fifties and tens.  but Stephen Markham and A.P. Rockwood were appointed  captains of hundreds. I was appointed captain of Ten and the  following are the names: Wilford Woodruff J.S. Fowler J Burnham  Orson Pratt Joseph Egbert John M. Freeman Marcus B. Thorp George  A Smith and George Wardle being 9 in all.    The camp consisted of 73 waggons 143 men 3 women  and two children making in all 148 souls.    We travelled 8 miles next day and camped  in the border of a grove of cottonwood to spend the Sabbath. In the  afternoon the organization of the camp was completed according to the  following order: Brigham Young Lieutenant General Stephen Markham  Colonel John Pack 1st Major Shedrick Rounday 2nd Major.  The Regment to be divided into tens under the following captains:    Wilford Woodruff capt. of 1st company  Ezra T. Benson - 2nd comp. Phineas H Young 3rd co.  Luke Johnson 4th Stephen H.

General Orders for the Camp  Orders from General Young was for the whole regiment  to journey in a compact body as we were in an Indian country  and for every man to carry his gun loaded the cap locks to  be shut on a piece of buckskin with caps ready to slip on at  the instant in case of attack, for flint locks with cotton or tow  in the pan and powder flask always handy to prime quickly  and for every man to walk by the side of his waggon and not  to leave it except sent away by order. The object of all this  caution was to prevent accident for strict discipline was necessary  while travelling through a hostile Indian country. 
 Some traders came down from the Pawnees and camped  with us over night. They had plenty of Buffaloo meat dried and they gave  us what we wished and informed us that we were within two days  drive of the whole ^a large band^ of the Pawnees. We camped here in  a line for the Sabbath.    Sunday the 18 President Young called  the captains together and gave them instructions concerning our travel.  We were to start in the morning two abreast all who were not driving  teams were to carry their guns and walk by the side of the waggons  and no man to go hunting to get out of sight of the camp. In  the ^evening^ morning the bugle was to be blown at ^5 o'clock^ half past 8 o'clock and  the camp to arise and pray cook eat feed horses harness them &  and start at the call of the bugle at 7 o'clock and at night  the bugle was to be blown at half past eight when all wasere to  go to prayers in their several waggons and retire to bed by  9 o'clock. Each Saturday night we were to pitch  our tents or camp in our waggons and rest forrom our journey  on the Sabbath. This was the order of The Camp.    It was quite cold on Monday morning.  The bugle blew at five o'clock for prayers and at seven for starting.  We travelled according to general orders and bore a no[r]therly direction  until about noon when we reached the north bend of the Platte  10 1/2 miles north of the ford. Professor Pratt took an  observation and found it to be in Lat. 41. 27. 5.: The crossing  place of the Horn was in Lat. 41. 16. 24., making the North  Bend of the Platt 10 1/2 miles north of the ford. We formed  a circle at noon and baited.    While nooning Elder Little P. Rockwell  and two others arrived and brought the meal. I received  two letters one from my wife and one from Leonard Hardy  of Mass who informed me that Milton Homes and his father  and mother had turned strangites and been cut off the church.    Brother Little brought with him 
 many things that Col. T Kane had sent as presents to the Twelve and others. I  recieved a stop-box marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket.  It was a splendid present.    We camped at night near a grove of timber on  the bank of the Platte where we formed a circle on the edge of the bank.  The river on one side was our defence and the forewheel of each waggon was  drove up to the hinder wheel of the one before it and all the horses  and cattle taken inside of the corrall: so that we were secure against  the Indians.    There was a hard wind during the night and  the morning was fair but a strong south ^west^ wind which covered our waggons  with sand dust.    The grass was now about 4 inches high s[c]attering  and there was not half feed for our animals so all along thus far we  had to cut down cottonwood trees &c to feed them and the horses  would knaw off the bark from brouse limbs as readily  as they would eat corn of which we gave to each horse 2 quarts  per day.    We started on our journey 2 1/2 miles and  came to another grove of small and large cottonwood covering  about 40 acres. It was about 5 miles to the tableland  which was now rising into a bluff. Here the road runs 20  degrees south of the west Bending to S. by W. one mile in  which distance we passed three Islands in the Platte covered  with timber the largest of which was about ten acres and  there continues a chain of Islands for miles along the river  and some timber on the south side of the Platte.    Three miles from our last encampment  we came to Shell Creek and one and half miles from Shell  Creek is a Prairie Dog village covering about 6 acres of ground.  This Creek was timbered only by a few scattering willows. and  the river was about parallel    After crossing Shell Creek bridge the 
 road runs about S.W. by W. 60 degrees west of South for about 15 miles.  The Platt is skirted bywith timber    Professor Pratt and myself went forward  of the company to take observations. After travelling 13 miles we  stoped baited horses and took observations. The company approached us  and we continued on 5 miles and the whole encampment came up and  we camped for the night in a cirlce and cut down cottonwood trees to  feed our horses.    The following day was A cloudy day was the next one with a   light sprinkling of rain and wind in the east and our course westward.  The teams started at 7 o'clock and the horse teams between 8 and 9.  An Indian appeared on a mound mounted on a poney about 5 miles  from us. He went out of sight and again appeared. He then  approached the camp full speed was met by the brethren and  shook hands and was followed by seven others. They went through  the encampment and then returned with us.    We travelled til half past 12 o'clock when  when we came in sight of 70 Indian horses and mules and soon in  sight of a large Pawnee village on the North side of Loop Fork and  also one on the south side of it. We drove on by the villages  and they soon began to sally out to come to us and we camped  in the form of a half moon the bank of the river forming  a parallel line in front.    The Indians to the number of about  200 0n the South side of the river came down to the shore. Some  waded over and about 75 came into camp including the grand chief  of the nation with many war chiefs. We met them before  we left the ground and made them presents of 4 1 lbs of tobacco  15 lbs of lead powder fishhooks beads flour salt &c but still  they were not satisfied. Considering our numbers they thought  they ought to have had more.    When we left the ground the  Indians oppeared very disatisfied but we harnessed up our teams 
 and drove on to Lookingglass Creek and camped at its mouth for the night upon  the bank of the Loop Fork.    After our horses were turned out we were called  together and in consequence of the disatisfaction of the Indians  a guard of 100  men was called for. The quorum of the Twelve with nearly the whole  camp volunteered to stand guard one half of them the forepart of the  night and the other the latter part. We also had a picket guard of  five men with their mules at each watch.    I was one of the picket guard. We had  a hard wind and rain in the afternoon which continued a portion of  the time that I was on guard. I rolled myself up in my buffalo  robe and let the wind and rain beat on to me. We were released  at about 1 o'clock and went to rest; but no Indians appeared   during the night.    Looking Glass Creek was crossed 15 minutes  before 9 on the morrow and a westerly course continued and Beaver  Creek reached at noon. There was a good many otter on the   Lookingglass and Beaver about a mile above the mouth of Beaver  Creek.    Professor O. Pratt took the meridian observation  of the sun by the sextant for the Lat. which was found to be  41Â° 25' 15". We also found the magnetic needle to  vary about 12 degrees east  and also made other observations  for the time &c.    We crossed ^Beaver^ Beverer Creek at half past two o'clock  travelled seven miles and came to the Pawnee Missionary Station  and camped for the night. The Bluff was skirted with some  oaks on the north side of the road in the hills. We kept out a guard  through the night as we were in danger of the Sioux on the one  side and the Pawnees on the other.    While watering the horses at the creek at  the station this evening brother George A Smith's horse mired  pitched forward and jumped on to him treading upon his feet and 
 breast and holding him fast in the mud while I caught the horse by the bit and  backed him off. I was fearful that brother Smith was badly injured  but found that he was not.    Ch. 26    A Day of Adventures.  April the 23    The next day was one of adventures to the Pioneer  company. In the morning 12 of us started on horse back to  search out a ford across the dangerous and troublesome Loop Fork  up the Platte River.    We went down the River some distance  and several men waded across and found the water so deep and   so much quicksand that we came to the conclusion to drive up  to the old Pawnee Village. So we returned to the camp and  harnessed up our horses.    My gray horse named Titus had the was sick yet I started out with him and the camp drove  up with some little difficulty to the old Indian village or a little  below it and men commenced searching out a ford and found the  whole bed of the river one body of quicksand into which if a horse  or waggon stoped it would begin to sink down.    We had two channels of water to cross  with a sand bar in the middle. The deepest water was from 3  to 4 feet deep and very rapid and about 300 yards across. At  some places the quicksand sank both man and beast instantly and  the more they struggled to get out the more they would sink. Of  course we avoided such places as much as possible.    As I led the van with my ten being  the 1st ten it fell to my lot to make the first trial. Professor  O. Pratt having a strong pair of horses went forward and I followed  him. I had two yoke of cattle and my horses on my  carriage with about ten hundred on it.    As soon as I started I immediately 
 saw that the cattle did but little good being slow and in the way. We would stop  and begin to sink. I jumped out of my carriage into the water up to my  waist and about ten men came to my assistance with a drag rope and  hitched it to the oxen and assisted me in getting across the first stream  though with great difficulty.    We stoped on a sand bar out of the water  but my horses and waggon began to sink. By treading the ground a little  it would become a perfect quagmire; yet though we were sinking in it  the men had to leave the waggon where it was and go to the assistance  of Orson Pratt who in trying to cross the second stream had sunk into  a bed of quicksand and all the men had to go to his relief to get his horses  and waggon out. The horses were unhitched from the wagon and  the load taken out and carried to shore by hand and the waggon drawn  out by the help of men.    I took off a part of my load in fact most  of it in a boat and went through the second stream nearly empty and  got out two other waggons done in the same way but it was so  terrific and undertaking that the rest of the camp would not follow in   our track.    So here we found ourselves on the opposite  side of the River 6 men of us to spend the night together with our horses  and waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band then camped  below us on the same side of the river; and it was supposed they  numbered 600 warriors. We divided our company making three  on guard at a time.    Brother Pack Orson Pratt and myself went.  on guard the forepart of the night. Although I had been in the  water the whole of the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothing  one half of the night and slept in them the other half.    We had not more than got our portion of  the night through when we were joined by five men from the   camp who crossed in a boat and were sent by President Young  to assist us making eleven of us in all and we divided one force 
 accordingly. The night however passed off in peace and ^no^ disturbance from  hostile Indians.    The morning when it came was pleasant and Professor  Pratt took and ^an^ observation on the south bank of the fording place on the Loop  Fork. and The Lattitude was found to be 4^1^4Â° 22' 37"    The camp on the other side were now  busy in devising plans to cross the River. They drew together  timber and rails to build two rafts and began to put it together but  some of the brethren made another trial to cross with waggons by  putting on several horse and mule teams.    They went a little higher up than we  did and got over with much less difficulty and the more the ground  as trod in the water the smoother and harder it grew. So the  whole encampment turned their waggons back to the ford and abbandoned  the raft. By unloading one half of the baggage they could cross  in safety and the whole came over by doubling teams and by  going back and forth until all were over each captain with his  ten assisting each other across. So in this way all Israel  who were present went over (not Jordan) but the Loop Fork of  the Platte River in safety without hurt to man or beast and  they felt thankful to God for his mercies and rejoiced that they  were on the south side of the river.    We all loaded up our waggons and  drove 4 miles and camped for the Sabbath on the bank of  the River and after our waggons were arranged the Twelve took  a walk on the high table land to make observations with our  glasses of the surrounding country.    Sunday came with a pleasent morning.  The order of the Pioneer Camp was that there should be no fishing  hunting nor labour of any kind on The Sabbath except that  which was absolutely needed.    Four Antelopes appeared before us on  the plain on the opposite side of the river. We could see them 
 with the naked eye but much better through our spyglasses. This was the first  antelope I ever saw. About 10 o'clock  4 Elk also appeared on the opposite  side and we viewed them with our glasses and these were the first Elk  I had ever seen.    After making the Sabbath a day of rest   both for man and beast until 4 o'clock the Camp gathered together   for a meeting and were addressed by a number of the brethren; the  guards were placed out as usual to guard the Camp at night and a company  of hunters appointed to go forward of the company for game. There  were 7 horsemen and 10 footmen appointed and the quorum of  the Twelve had the privilage of joining than when they pleased.    Indian Attacks    Early in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians crept  upon their hands and knees approaching the camp to steal horses. They  got within 3 rods of the guard before they were discovered. The guard  first thought them to be wolves and snapped at them. They rose up and  ran. Two of the guards fired and 4 others rose up out of the grass.  The bugle was sounded and all arose to arms not knowing but there was  a large party near by; but no more were seen there.    I started out in the morning with the Hunters.  We saw 8 deer & 4 antelopes but caught nothing. Eight miles travel and we  camped for noon. On the opposite of the river were relics of an old  Indian town.    In the afternoon we travelled 7 miles and camped  on Clear Creek with a hard gravel bottom the first of the kind we had  met on the road. We killed one wild goose and saw fresh signs of  buffalo where we camped being the first we had seen. Brothers Young  Kimball Richards and myself went on to a high bluff to view the country.    Just at dusk a tremd^i^ous alarm was  given through the Camp that Indians had cralled up and taken Porter  Rockwell and his horse and made off with him. Many men mounted 
 their horses and made after hime with all speed but it was soon discovered   that Rockwell was in camp but that two horses were gone  Dr Richard's and brother Little's. About 20 men mounted and  armed went in search of the horses.    On the morrow we continued our journey  a south course to try to get on the Platte River came on to some  beautiful green grass saw a great quantity of Buffalo signs but  found no wood nor water. We baited our horses in a green  valley after 12 miles travel.    Just as we were starting in the afternoon  we rose unto a small bluff and saw two antelopes in the valley  before us. Brothers Young Kimball and myself were together. Bro  Brown and another brother was on the other side of the hills and saw  them. Brother Brown first fired on one and the other man and  myself fired. We all hit him with our balls but he did  not fall; we rose up and cut his throat. This was    The First Antelope Killed.    He was dressed and put on board the waggons and we continued on  and in a short time saw three more at the top of a mound  looking at us. Brother Brown and myself went after them but  could not get them so we: so we turned about 10 degrees East of  South and went to the Creek and camped. Our cattle and horses  were very dry not finding any water through the day.    We had a heavy storm of thunder lightning  wind and some rain which lasted about an hour. A rifle ball  went off in brother Brown's waggon by accident and the ball  went through a bag of clothes set it on fire then through the  waggon and broke the leg of a fine horse and the result was  the breaking up of one of the teams of the Pioneer Company.    Brother Rockwell and 3 others had gone  in the morning again in search of the ho[r]ses which the Indians 
 could not shoot them. We shot 4 geese. I shot two of them and one  deer but did not get the deer.    30 We travelled 16 miles next day and camped  without wood or water and the grass short affording but little feed.    Our First Buffalo Hunt.  May 1st 1847    This was an interesting day to the Hunters of the   Camp of Israel who put out and the camp started on the journey   before breakfast travelled 6 miles and camped on the prairie in  sight of    A Herd of Buffalo Feeding on the Bluff to our right  They were about 200. Three only of the hunters started out after  them who rode near and left their horses and crawled upon them  to get a shot but they frightened the herd and they ran away.    A little before the main herd being  seen three Bulls were discovered on the bluff. OP. Rockwell and two  others went after them and wounded two but got neither.    We had not travelled more than two miles  farther before we discovered another large herd five miles ahead of  us. The hunters gathered together and held a council and  waited until the camp came up. We were determined to get  some of the Buffalo if possible.    We travelled with the camp until within  a mile of the herd when a halt was made and 15 hunters  started out. Amasa Lyman and myself of the quorum of the   Twelve were with them. We all travelled together on to the Bluff  within a few rods of the herd and then divided out. Brother  Grover and Luke Johnson went together into the Bluff; OP. Rockwell  and brother Brown took the entire left and so we divided into   companies on the righ left and centre. I was with the company  in the centre of the herd 
 We all made a charge upon them from the Bluffs and  rushed on to the plain. The herd ran very fast down the ruff bluffs into  the plain but when we reached the plain we soon overtook them and each  company singled out its game. We made choice of cows generally; then  rushed up by the side of them and fired upon them with our pistols  such as horse pistols & rifle pistols which we found much better to  carry that rifles which were cumbersome running.    The first we gave chaise to was a Buffalo  cow with her calf. I rode by the side of her and fired two balls  which took effect and the other brethren with me also fired until she  was killed. We cut her throat.    I then ran my horse to the assistance of another  party who had wounded one and that was also soon dispatched. I  then saw that O.P. Rockwell had three bulls at bay on the prairie and  Brother Pack and myself ran our horses to his assistance and brother  Kimball came up at the same time.    We surrounded them and commenced firing  upon them. They bolted a-head. I put spurs to my horse and  ran in front and was in about a rod of them when they all pitched  at me and gave me chase for fight. I had to be quick to get  out of the way but I soon cleared them. Two broke for the bluff  and brother Brown put for them but Rockwell Kimball Pack and   myself stuck to the old bull. I fired 2 balls into him, Bro  Kimball one and Bro Pack one and the bull fell dead and we  cut his throat. We also shot a calf that was with him.    By this time the two that had left us and  after which Brother Brown was gone was more than a mile distant  in the Bluffs. Brother Kimball and myself gave chase to  them and when we were within 20 rods of the bluff we saw  two come out and run for the main herd to which we gave chase  for awhile but they were fresh and my horse had ran nearly  ten miles in the chase; so we gave up the pursuit.    I returned to Brother Brown in the Bluff 
 and found that one of the bulls to which he gave chase was ^wounded^ nearly ^dead^ killed  and had laid down but Brother Brown having no more powder or ball  before I aflrrived the bull had got up again and ran into the herd on the  Bluff. So we all returned on our chase ground to gather up the  meat we had killed being 3 cows ^3^ one bull[s] and five calfs making  eleven in all.    Brother Soloman Hancock went out in the morning  to kill buffalo on foot. He did not come in at night and we  felt concerned about him; but in the morning he returned having  killed a 3 year old cow and watched her during the night to  keep the wolves from the eating her. Three wolves came upon  him. He shot one and the rest ran away.    This made 12 Buffalo in all that  the Hunters which killed on their first day's Buffalo chase and  we considered this pretty well seeing that we were all strangers to  the Buffalo hunt and but very few of us had ever seen one before  in our lives.    We dressed our meat and waggons came  from the camp to take it in.    A part of our chase was through an immense  prairie dog town nearly ten miles long and 2 wide with burrows  nearly at every rod and great danger of the horses steping into  them and falling. My horse ran into me and was near falling  but no harm was met by any of the hunters. This was the  first Buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw.    The next day was Sunday and all were  busy cooking and saving their meat and in the afternoon we moved  three miles up for better feed and camped by the side of a large  slough of water. Our last camping place was at the head of  Grand Island. Professor Pratt took an observation and found it  to agree with Fremont's observation taken two miles south of our  camping ground on the south side of the river.    Soon after we camped a herd of 
 Buffalo came from the Bluff to the river to drink within about 2 miles and then  returned to the Bluffs. Some were anxious to go after them but as it was  Sunday President Young thought it best to let them be until to morrow.    The Indians set fire to the prairie before us which  burned rapidly over a large region of country. Brothers Young Kimball   and others went in the evening several miles on the road to examine the fire  and other things.    Monday morning the hunters were called 20   in number to go into the Bluff for a still hunt for buffalo and other  game. We started out with two waggons to bring in the game.    I had taken a severe cold which had settled in  my side where my bones were broken last fall and it made me sick and  I was unfit for the hunt yet I started with the Hunters though I  had jarred myself badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday and  was now feeling its effects.    At the same time the hunters started another  company was formed to explore the route and see if we could get grass  for our horses as the Indians had been burning it for several  days.    When the Hunters reached the bluffs they divided  into two parties 10 in each and we travelled some 10 miles back and  forth over the hills and saw no game except antelopes and wolves.    I felt so unwell that I concluded to return to  camp and A Lyman and three others were with me. We sat down   upon the edge of the Bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves when  a company of horsemen approached in haste bearing a red flag. When  they got within a mile of us we trailed our arms and went down  to meet them and were informed that the party who had gone up the  river had come upon an encampent of about 400 Indians warriors  and a party of about 100 had followed them down a ravine to cut  of their retreat. We went into the camp.    The horsemen had come to call in the Hunters  and in their return they came across a herd of Buffalo and they 
 brought into camp three calves and 4 antelope.    There was a good guard during the night kept and  early in the morning the cannon was fired twice to let the Indians know that we  were awake. I had a very severe night with my side.    We started on our journey in the morning   five ^waggons^ agons abreast making five roads. This was to be in readiness  in case of an attack from Indians.    We travelled 3 miles and saw some waggons  on the opposite side of the river going down the Platte. Soon one of  the men waded the river and came to see us to know who we were.  He informed us they were traders from Fort Laramie that they  were 16 days from that place the grass good on the South side  but burned up on the North side by the Indians. He would take  letters for us to Sarpee who lived near Winter Quarters; so the  camp stoped and wrote 52 letters to our families.    I was ahead of the company with   Orson Pratt taking observations and did not know of the matter  until the time was nearly up and I then in great hast scribbled  a few lines to my wife. An epistle was written to the  Church and three brethren accompanied the Frenchman across  the Platte to the other men of t his company who were 9 in all  who informed the brethren that they had not seen an Indian  since they left Laramie that there was a ferry at the fort &  and agreed to take our letters safe.    We drove on three miles farther and  bailed our teams until the brethren returned from the French  traders when they made a report to the camp of what was said  to them. A council of the whole company of Pioneers was  then called to decide whether we should cross the Platt or continue  up the North side.    We were convinced that it would be better  for us as a company to cross the river on to the old travelling  road to Laramie as there was good grass on that side 
 while the Indians were burning it all off on the North side of the river where  we were travelling; but when we took into consideration the situation of the next companies  and the thousands who would follow after and as we were the Pioneers and had  not our wives and children with us we thought it best to keep on the North  side of the River and brave the difficulties of burning prairies. Thus  a road would be made that should stand as a permanent route for the  Saints independant of the old emigration route and the River would  seperate the emigrant companies that they need not quarrel for wood  grass or water and when our next company should come along the  grass would be much better than on the south side as it would grow  by that time.    These were the views that the Pioneers assembled  in a mass council took and the vote was called and it was unanimously  resolved to go on the North side of the river. So the camp again  moved on; but during the moving Col. Markham drilled the men  in a military capacity and they unshiped the cannon and carried  it on wheels.    The Frenchman informed us that he never saw  so many buffalo on the route before as this season and that they had to  stop several times to let the herds pass. We saw many deer  and antelope this day and a few buffalo and at night camped  near a herd but a short distance from us. It was also afterwards  found that the alarm of the 3rd about the 400 Indian warriors was  a false one and that a man had been frightened by a herd of antelope  supposing them in the distance to be Indians.    The change from salt to fresh meat was  affecting many in the camp.    In the morning we had to keep a guard out to  prevent a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle. Two bulls  at noon were approaching our herd of cows and men had to go out and  drive them off. In the afternoon the brethren killed one  cow and 5 calves and brought in a bull calf alive with the intentions  of raising it. It would try hard to bunt the men and dogs over 
 and some got hard raps. It was dead however the next day.    We stoped for the night but found the grass on  fire and had to return back one mile and camped on the bank of the river on  a spot that was just burned over except small patches. Some took their   horses on to an Island near by and cut down cottonwood for feed.    We started early next morning without feeding  (excepting a little corn) as there was no grass; travelled three miles and   left it in our rear the fire and breakfasted on a good spot of grass.    This morning the herds of buffalo speck both  sides of the river and the antelope was in great abundance some of which  would run into the camp. A young buffalo calf also came in and  followed us and we gave them some milk and left him.    We continued our journey seeing many   herds of buffalo & antelope and one large herd of Elk. Two antelopes  were killed this morning but as there was so much meat in camp  it was thought best not to kill many more game until we needed it.    Dr Richards George A Smith and myself   walked up quite near several herds of Buffalo and examined them through   our glasses. They were shedding their coats. One bull had a mass  of wool swin[g]ing by his side like a loose robe.    Our herd of cows started to run among   the Buffalo but President Young galloped his horse to separate them   and had great difficulty in doing so. He lost a spyglass in the chase  worth 40 dollars. The brethren hunted a long time for it but   could not find it.    We continued our journey among the herds   of buffalo and were not out of sight of them at all and they had   eaten the grass to such a degree that there was little remaining for   our cattle and timber also we not but seldom met. We camped at  night near a heard of buffalo that reached as far as our eyes could  extent. This day the camp made 20 miles.    Next day I should judge we saw ten   thousand buffalo and came near one large herd with an unusual 
 number of calves yearlings and two years old. We saw several large ones mired  dead wolves had commenced eating some. Wolves on every hand were seen  following the herd to eat those who died by wounds &c.    President Young and others rode out in the evening a  few miles to search out the road. There was some rain.    The next morning was a pleasant morning and not  so cold and windy as the day before. A start was not made until 10 o'clock  as the teams needed rest and feed bad. I rode forward to day with the Twelve  and others and the sights of buffalo that our eyes beheld was most astonishing.  Thousands upon thousands would crowd together as they came from the bluffs  to the bottom land to go to the river and sloughs to drink until the river  and land upon both sides of it looked as though the face of the earth was  alive and moving like the waves of the sea. Brother Kimball remarked  that he had heard many buffalo tales told but never expected to behold  what his eyes now saw. The half had not been told him.    When we stoped at noon many of the  buffalo walked along beside our waggons so that it would have been  easy to shoot them down. O. P. Rockwell did shoot one through  the neck and she droped dead. It was a two year old heffer and good  meat. We had great difficulty in keeping our cattle and horses  from going among the herds and if they had got mixed it would have  been almost impossible to have ever got them again.    We travelled 11 1/4 miles this day until we  came to the bluffs that made down to the River and there we camped for  the night. Brother William Clayton had prepared a mile gage on  the hind wheel of his waggon so that the distance could be measured.    Brigham Young H. C. Kimball George  A Smith and myself went on to the highest bluffs near and took a  survey of the surrounding country without glasses; and the scene  before us north east and west as far as our vision extended looked  as rough as the sea in a storm with the ridges and valleys mostly  sand and scarcely any green thing upon it excepting a little scattering  grass and the Spanish soap root which the Mexicans use for washing 
 The top resembles a pineapple & I brought in one root 24 inches long and  two in diamater. I pounded a little of it and found that it would fill  a dish with suds like soap.    On Sunday the 9th as we had no feed around us our  teams passed across the bluffs 4 miles and camped for the day. I  wrote two letters one to brother Ferguson and the other to Brother Bevin  for brother Wolsey ^Wolsey^ to take with him to Pueblo ^Pueblo^. We had a  meeting and a good one. The Spirit of God ruled over the camp.  Peace quietness and contentment pervaded almost every breast.    The Twelve met and it was thought  best not for the brethren to start for Pueblo until they arrived  at Laramie. I rode with the Twelve and others 4 miles  up the river and saw large herds of buffalo come to water.    Monday morning was cool. Before leaving  the camp ground a letter was written to the next camp which  should follow put into a small box nailed to a post 12 feet  long one end of which was planted firmly in the ground and  standing as a guide board with the following words inscribed:  "Open this box and you will find a letter; 316 miles to Winter  Quarters; Pioneers; Lattitude 41Â°. Our friends we had  no doubt would be glad to get the letter as it contained an account  of our journey.    We travelled 6 miles and nooned and then  travelled 4 more and camped for the night. Our teams was  week in consequence of there being no grass for several  days. It being eaten all up. There was one buffaloâ€”one  deer and one hare brought into camp to day by the Hunters  which was distributed among the company. We had what  fresh meat we wanted daily.    The grass we found somewhat better  to day and we met but few buffalo but passed through  some miles of dead grass which we burned to give new  feed to the next company. It made a great fire indeed 
 The Hunting Ground of the Sioux    Two days afterwards we found ourselves travelling  over the hunting ground of the Sioux. Some 8 or ten days prior there  had been a large band there of from 500 to 1000. This we judged from  the signs around us. They had taken the brains out of the large  buffalo their hides generally and some of the meat and had broken  up the bones for the marrow. One Hundred calves we found  dead in one place with nothing taken but the tongues legs to  their knees and entrails. At another place 35 calves were  found dead and washed in heaps where the buffalo had been chased  across the the river and had ran over the calves in rising the bank  of the river.  I found on the bluff their medicine bag  tied to a stick 6 feet long struck up in the bank; also a saddle  tied to a large buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which  way the buffalo had gone.    I had left my horse to feed in the valley  while I went on the Bluff to view the country and he started off  not seeing the camp took the back track and I had to run after  him and in doing this I ran through the great encampment of  the Sioux where their lodges had been on their hunting expedition.  Here I left my gun and followed my horse until I overtook  him & with the assistance of brother Fowler who came out of the  encampment I stoped him and rode back got my gun and  examined the ground and judged that there had been five hundred  lodges. There were acres of ground covered with buffalo  wool where they had dressed their skins buffalo wolf &c  I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin.    Many of the brethren went out the next  day to visit the Indian encampment and brought in parts  of robes leather &c which had been left. 
 We travelled to day eleven miles. The bluffs  for the first time on the North Fork came bald to the river so that  we had to go over the bluffs with our waggons.    There is one thing concerning the Platt River  worthy of note. It is much of the way a mile in width generally  covered with water but very shallow. When the south wind blows  hard the water all rushes to the north shore so that one would  suppose there was a great rise in the tide but let the wind shift  and blow hard from the north and the water immediately  recedes from the north shore until one can walk across two  thirds of the River on bare ground. Thus the River constantly  ebbs and flows like the tide according to the wind.    Early next morning I went out to hunt  Buffalo returned to breakfast and started out agian with Phineas  Young. I got lost among the Bluffs but found my way out  again. Brother Phineas shot a buck antelope and I carried  him into camp. There were three antelopes and one buffalo  killed.    Some of the hunters thought they heard Indian  guns during the night on the opposite side of the river. An  Indian cralled up to a pair of mules that were tied together and  made a grab at them but the mules sprang and got away  One of the gards shot at him and he ran. All the horses  were then brought into the circle of our camp and the cannon  prepared for firing but seeing no one it was not fired.    A large number of barefoot tracks  were seen next morning supposed to be of the Indians who came  down last night to steal our horses. We travelled eight  miles during the day: in the morning our road was over the  Bluffs with cold North wind and rain but we had the best grass  we had found on the road. We camped on the prairie. I  went out with some others to hunt got within about 30 rods  of the Buffalo and shot at the neck of one. The ball entered 
 his shoulder and crippled him but he hobbled away with the herd. There were a number  of hunters among the herds and one of them killed a fat buffalo which was  brought into camp.    Sunday the 16th was still cloudy and a cold wind. With  Brothers Young Kimball Benson Rockwell and Stephens I rode 4 miles  over the Bluffs to pick out a road for the Pioneers to get again on the  bottom land. We had a good meeting in the afternoon; and the  laws of the camp were read. One of the brethren had shot an  antelope and a buffalo which was against the rules of the camp  to go hunting on the Sabbath.    Monday was warm and pleasant but our road  was hard: two and a half miles through land bluffs when we again  struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our last camping place.  The hunters brought in 3 buffalo which detained the camp sometime  to get and President Young was not pleased with it as we had  so much meat in camp. We saw large droves of deer in the  bottoms more than we had seen before. A young fawn was picked  up and brought into camp. I led the company of Pioneers  mostly through the bluffs in the morning before brothers Young  and Kimball came up when we rode together all day  picking out the road.    The camp was called together next day  and President Young sharply reproved the hunters for shooting  so much meat detaining the camp and for taking more life  than necessary and also the horsemen for their indifference in  picking out the road. He said there were but two who had  manifested any interest in helping him get the camp along  Afterwards the horsemen went forward to pick out the road instead  of going hunting and I did not hear a gun fired during the day.    The following day we met the worst  sand hill on the journey and what made it worse was that the  rain was pouring down upon us continually; and we had more rain  during the day and evening than ever before on our route. I rode 
 forward during the day in the rain picking out the road. We travelled  eight miles.    Next morning seven miles were made and  we moved opposite Ash Creek on the South side of the river where  the Origon raod first strikes the North fork of the Platt. Several  of the brethren went over in the boat which we were taking along  to examine the rocky bluffs road creek &c.    In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles  and camped for the night. We had a very good road most of the day  on the bank of the river. There was a good bit of rock bluff on  both sides of the river and some on the South side was formed into  natural terraces rotundas squares &c from 50 to a hundred feet  high and looked like good foundations for forts fortifications and strong  holds. They resemble the works of art and look something like  the old castles of England and Scotland. They were level on the  top. There is a beautiful Cedar Island in the river a  short distance above Ash Creek which is a good landmark to  show travellers where the Oregon road strikes the river.    Before we left the encampment next  morning Bro Clayton put up a guide board for the benefit of  the next company bearing the inscription, "From Winter Quarters  409 miles; from the Junction 93 1/4 Cedar Bluff 36 1/2  Ash Hollow 8 miles and 133 from Fort Laramie."    We travelled 7 1/2 miles and nooned and  eight more and camped for the night. I killed a bagger with  the jaw bone of a buffalo.    Just as we got to our camping place two  Indians came from the Bluffs riding towards us and made signs for  us to come to them. Several of the brethren went. It was  a Sioux Indian and his squaw. They talked by signs and  went away.    Our road was very straight on the morrow's  travel but we came over 2 1/2 miles of the worst sand hill that we 
 had passed. The bluffs on our route today presented the most singular natural  scenery I had ever beheld in all my travels. It had the appearance of the  old walls and ruins of the castles of Europe. The brethren found a part of  a petrified leg bone of a mammoth. It was from the knee joint downwards  was 17 inches long and 11 wide and weighed 27 lbs.    Next day was Sunday the 23rd. In company  with Brigham Young and the Twelve I visited the top of the highest bluff  ruins that lie opposite our encampment which was truly a curiosity. We  had a fair view of Chimney Rock from where we were. I carried a bleached  Buffalo's head on the top and we wrote upon it our names and distance  from several places. O. Pratt took a Barometrical observation on  the solitary cedar tree on the top of the bluff ruins.    The camp met at half past eleven in the  morning for Sabbath services. Erastus Snow addressed the meeting  followed by President Young who said he was satisfied that the  Lord was with us and leading us. He had never seen a company  of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the journey;  that we should pluck the fruit of this mission to all eternity; that  he had many things to teach us but could not do it only in a stake  of Zion; but he was well satisfied with himself his brethren the Twelve  and the camp at large. One thing he would say to the praise of  all and that was that not one had refused to obey his council on the  road. His peace with God was continually like a river and he felt  that the fruit of peace rested upon the whole camp.    Several others spoke and the meeting was then  dismissed.    We intended to have rode out in the evening but  saw that a storm was gathering. It began to blow very hard and  it was as much as we could do to save our waggon bows and covers  from being smashed. It continued for about an hour and then  rained for another hour accompanied by hail. I covered all my horses  with all the blankets I could get and got up several times in the night  to see them. It rained occasionaly and the horses shook with cold but 
 morning came and all was alive again and we continued our journey    As soon as we camped at noon two Indians  came to the camp. They were Sioux and well dressed and clean. We  gave them dinner and they left.    We camped at night near the quicksand  mountain making 16 1/2 miles that day. I rode about two  miles forward to find grass and a camping ground and on my  return saw about 30 Sioux plunge their horses into the river on  the opposite side and make towards us. I rode with several  others to the river and met them as they came out. They shook  hands with us very friendly. The chief unfurled a large American  flag with the Eagle stars and stripes and presented me a letter,  written in French which we however made out. They were all  well dressed and the chief was in a military coat. The brethren  brought a white flag and planted it by the side of theirs. They wanted to go into camp. We proposed  for five of them to go and the rest to remain but they all wanted  to go so we let them and gave them supper. They remained in camp all  night but were good and stole nothing.    Some little trading was done with the  Sioux next morning and we gave them breakfast. They behaved well and  when we started crossed the river. I had to keep my carriage today  having the rheumatism in shoulders & back and teeth ache.    We nooned next day in good grass 2 miles  above Chimney Rock and I rode to day with brothers Kimball and  Benson to look out the road. By an imperfect measurement by a  trigonometrical observation by the sextant Professor Pratt made  Chimney Rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river.    A Panic Among our Teams    Just before camping at noon while travelling on  a smooth Prairie an Indian horse that was bought of the Sioux  ran away with a singletree at his heals and gave a tremendous 
 fright to the cows oxen and horses and in an instant a dozen or more waggons  were darting by each other like lightning and the horses and mules flying as  it were over the ground some turning to the right and some to the left and  some ran into other waggons. The horses and mules that brother Fowler  was driving leaped with all speed with he holding the bits and brother Little  the lines darted by my carriage like electricity and came within one inch  of a collision with my wheels which would have made a wreck. Another  waggon with a pair of mules and one yoke of cattle dashed by which would  also have smashed my carriage had they looked. By this time my  own horses started to run but was held by the driver. Fowlers waggon  continued regardless of rough or smooth ground about 50 rods be ^being^ draged  the whole distance by the bit which was the case with many others  but all were soon stoped and returned to their lines without accident  which appeared truly a miracle. A person can hardly conceive the  power manifested by anamals especially mules in such a fright  and it gave us some idea what an Indian yell would do in a camp  with teams hitched to waggons.    Brother Kimball and myself picked the road  during our journey of the following morning ^morning^ and in the afternoon I piloted  as straight as any road yet made on the whole route and picked out a camping  ground on the bank of the river in good feed.    It showed he understood that we were pioneering  a road for the whole House of Israel to travel in for many a year  to come and therefore that it required the greatest care in marking  the route.    A cold rainy morning followed and we  concluded not to start until it stoped so we remained till 10 o'clock  and travelled 11 1/2 miles and camped for the night.    During the evening President Young called  at my fire and seeing several brethren playing dominoes in a waggon  near by he began to teach saying that the Devil was getting power  over the camp which had for several days given way to cards  dominoes &c and that if they did not spedily repent their works 
 labours and journey would be in vain. He said that to be sure the camp  didin't quarrel for the Devil would not set them at that as long as he  could draw them gradually away from duty and fill them with  nonsense and folly for the Devil was very cunning in winning away  the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks.    During the evening I went into Dr Richard's  waggon and read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and prayed with  them after which President Young H. C. Kimball Willard Richards  E. T. Benson and Wilford Woodruff met in council in brother Brigham's  waggon and President Young wrote some of the word of the Lord  concerning the camp and expressed his views and feelings; that  they must spedily repent or they would be cursed that they were  forgetting their mission and that he would rather travel with ten  righteous men who would keep the commandments of God than  the whole camp while in a carless manner and forgetting  God. We stayed together till ten o'clock    The Pioneers Chastised    Next morning President Young called the camp  together and required each captain seperately to call out his men and when  all were present except two who had gone out hunting he addressed  them something near in the following words:    "I think I will take as my text to  preach my sermon fromâ€”I am about to revolt from travelling  with this camp any farther with the Spirit they now possess.    "I had rather risk myself among the savages  with ten men who are men of faithâ€”men of mighty prayerâ€”men of  God than to be with this whole camp when they forget God and  turn their hearts to folly and wickedness yea I would rather be  alone and I am now resolved not to go any father with the  camp unless you will covenant to humble yourselves before  the Lord and serve Him and cease your folly and wickedness 
 For a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing and checkers and  dominoes have occupied the attention of the brethren and dancing and nigering  and hooing down all has been the test continually.    Now it is time to quit it. There has been  trials and lawsuits upon every nonsensical thing and if this is suffered to  go on it will not be but a short time before you are fighting ^knocking^ mowing each  other down and taking life. It is high time it was stoped.    I do not want to hear anymore such reports   as I heard last Sunday of men going to meeting and preaching to the  rest after playing cards until meeting time. You are a pretty set of  men going to look out a location among the mountains for a resting  place for the Saints even the whole Church of God who have been  driven out from the Gentiles and rejected of them. And after you  have established a location you are then going out to preach the  Gospel and seal salvation upon the House of Israel and gather the nations.    How would you look if they should know   your conduct and ask you what you did when you went to seek out  Zion and find a resting place for the Saints where the standard of  the Kingdom of God could be reared and her banners unfurled for  for the nations to gather unto?    "Did you spend a good deal of your time  in dancing pitching quoit jumping wrestling and the like? Yes, yes.  Did you play cards dice checkers dominoes? O! Yes.    What ycould you do with yourselves?  Why you would think from the glance of the eyes of God angels and  men even wicked men. Then are you not ashamed of yourselves  for practising these things? Yes you are, and you must quit  it."    After speaking somewhat lengthy upon these  matters President Young called Twelve together and the High  Priests Seventies and Elders and there was found to be eight of  the quorum of the Twelve 18 High Priests 80 Seventies and  eight Elders. 
 After this was done President Young said unto the  Twelveâ€”    "I[f] you are willing to humble yourselves before the Lord  and covenant to do right and walk humbly before Him make  it manifest by raising the right hand."    Then each one raised his hand and  the same question was put to the High Priests Seventies Elders and  Members and all universally covenentted with uplifted hands to  humble themselves before the Lord repent of their sins and keep  His commandments.    President Young then spoke of those who  were not in the Church as there was some present. They would  be protected in their rights but they must not introduce wickedness  into the camp for it would not be suffered. He also spoke  of the standard and ensign that would be reared in Zion.    Elder Kimball followed and said that  the words of President Young was as the word of the Lord unto  him and just as binding us though it was a written revelation  and it was just as binding upon the whole camp as it was  upon him and he urged the Pioneers to give heed to the teachings  that had been given.    O Pratt remarked that if the Saints had  leasure hours they could spend them at much better advantage then in  playing cards as there was a world of knowledge and science to be  obtained and every moment should be improved in storing the mind  with some good principle. And he acknowledged the teachings we   had received to be of the Lord.    Wilford Woodruff said: "A burned  child dreaded the fire. He had not forgotten his journey in  the camp of Zion in 1834 and should he live to the age of  Methusalah he should not forget the hour when the Prophet and  Seer Joseph Smith stood upon the waggon wheel and addressed  that camp and said that because they had not hearkened unto 
 unto his counsel but disobeyed and transgressed from time to time judgement must  come and that we should be visited by the Destroying Angels. And so we  were and more than twenty of our members fell by the stroke and we  all suffered much in our feelings. I pray the Lord I may not see another  such a time; and I would now advise my brethren to be careful in  keeping the counsel ^covenant^ we have made lest by and by the word of the Lord came  unto us as in the days of Joseph and we cannot escape His judgement.  I would advise all the brethren who have got cards and the like to from  them for if you keep the covenants you have made you will have no  time to use them and if you keep them for your children they will only  prove a curse to them. My prayer to God is that we may all be  enabled to keep our covenants with the Lord and each other. I rejoice  that the watchman in our midst are quick to comprehend and warn of  evil and reprove us when wrong that we may be saved and do the  will of God.    Brother George A Smith and myself went  together to pilot out the road. We travelled 8 1/2 miles and camped for the   night in good feed.    Day of Prayer and Fasting  Sunday 30th    We set this Sabbath apart for prayer and fasting.  In the morning I shaved cleansed my body put on clean  clothing & read a chapter in the Book of Mormon humbled myself  before the Lord and poured out my soul in prayer before ^Him^ the Lord  and His Spirit descended upon me and I was blessed and prepared for  the service of the day and then I spent some time in writing  in my Journal.    The camp had a prayer meeting in the  morning and met again for public meeting. President  Young with the Quorum of the Twelve and a few others went  into the valley of the hills and prayed according to the order of the 
 Priesthood. Porter and Brother Carrington watched to see that no Indians  came upon us. We had a good time. There was a heavy shower  storm appeared but it mostly went around and there was but little  rain where we were.    We returned to our waggons took some  refreshment having eaten nothing all day and soon the sun came  out pleasantly and in the evening I went out two miles with the  quorum of the Twelve into a high bluff and we had a good view  of the Black Hills and also engaged in prayers.    Two days afterwards we camped  opposite Fort Laramie. This was June the 1st.    When we arrived we saw some men  approaching us from the Fort and found them to be a part of the  company of Missisippi brethren who had been to Pueblo through  the Winter. Brother Crow and his family 7 waggons and  14 souls were the persons who were at Fort Laramie. He  informed us that the remainder of the Missisippi company with  the portion of the Mormon Battalion at Pueblo would start from Laramie  about the 1st of June and follow our trail; told us of 4 of the brethren  who had died and had heard nothing of the main body of the  Battalion.    President Young suggested the propriety of  of our leaving all our ploughs at the Fort except such as we need to  use immediately when we got to our destination and also to do  our blacksmithing mending waggons &c as soon as possible so that we  might go on our journey speedily. A company company was appointed  to attend to the herding and these branches of business.    June the 2nd in company with the Twelve  and others I crossed the river to visit the Fort. We examined  Fort St John which was now evacuated but the walls were still standing  The dimensions of Fort St John were 144 by 132 outside and inside contained  16 rooms. The largest on the North side was 98 feet long 47 wide  The Oregon trail ran one rod from S. W. corner of the fort. 
 We next visited Fort Laramie then occupied by 38 persons  mostly French who have married the Sioux. Mr Burdow was the superintendant.  This fort was 168 by 116 outside with 6 rooms inside. It was quite a pleasant  situation for a fort.    Mr Burdow was a Frenchman. He received us kindly  and invited us into a large setting room and gave us all the information  he could in relation to our route and furnished us with his flat bottom boat  on reasonable terms to assist us in ferrying the Platte. He informed us  that Gov. Boggs and his men had much to say against the Mormons and  cautioned him to take care of his horses and cattle &c lest we should  steal them and tried to prejudice him all he could against us. Burdow  said that Boggs company was quarreling all the time and most of his them  had deserted him. He finally told Boggs and company that let the Mormons  be what they might they could not be worse than he and his men.    After conversing with Mr Burdow a length of  time we got into the flat bottom boat about 20 of us and went down the  Laramie Fork to its mouth about 2 miles and up the Platte 1/2 a mile  to our camp. After dinner we met in council and decided that  Amasa Lyman should go to Pueblo with several other brethren to  meet the detachment of the Battalion that was there and for them  to come as soon as convenient to Laramie and follow our trail.    A very windy day followed but we commenced  before sunrise to ferry over our boats. My ten was the first that went  over.    We set up our blacksmiths shops in the old fort  to do our work and made fires to do our washing.    In the evening the Twelve and others went on to  the highest peak to view the surrounding country and on our return  we visited the Indian and French burying ground. The Indians were  laid upon a staging about 10 feet from the ground but the French  buried in the ground with crosses at their head being Catholics  and strong pickets around their burying place.    I wrote letters to Mrs Woodruff my father 
 A. O. Smoot and J. Benbow and left them in the hands of Mr [blank] who  kept the store and acted as Post Master. He said he would forward our letters  for Winter Quarters to the care of Mr Sarpee    Before we left the fort Bro Clayton erected  a guide board on the North side for the next company.    We started on our journey again on the 4th  and the route began to be attended with considerable interest of scenery as  we commenced the assent into the Black Hills.    Brother Robert Crow had joined us which  added to our company 9 men 5 women 3 children 6 waggons 13  yoke of oxen 20 cows 3 bulls ten young cattle and horses which  made our whole camp now 148 men 8 women 5 children  79 waggons 96 horses 51 mules 90 yoke of oxen 43 cows 3 bulls  9 calves 16 dogs and 16 chickens.    As we travelled father into the hills they  grew lofty and we began to come into an Elk bear and mountain sheep  country. Soon after we arrived at the Springs 15 miles from  Laramie the first company of Missouri emigrants came up 12 waggons  of them. We journeyed 10 1/2 miles farther in the afternoon and the Missouri  company camped a 1/4 of a mile below us.    Next day was Sunday the 6th which we devoted  to prayer and fasting but the Missouri company of emigrants started on  in the morning.    The camp met for prayer meeting at 8 o'clock  and the Spirit of the Lord was with the people and met again for  preaching at 11 o'clock. We had a shower of rain and the meeting  closed. Another company of Missouri wagons 20 in number  passed us. The rain soon cleared off and our company moved  forward five miles and camped for the night on Bitter Creek.    The two Missouri companies which had  camped near us at night started before us in the morning and while  moving another company of 13 waggons passed us. We were in a   fair view of Laramie Peak with its snow covered top. We camped 
 for the night on the Horse Shoe Creek in the best feed we had met on our journey. The  hunters brought in two black tailed deer and one antelope.    Next day we formed a company of men and went forward  of comf our teams and cleared the road of stone. We used pick axes bars spades &c  and it was a great help to our weak wgaggons.    In the afternoon we travelled 8 3/4 miles over the   most mountaneous road on our way and then descended into the Valley and  camped for the night on Labent Creek with an abudance of timber water  and good grass.    Brother John Higby went forward hunting and saw  the Missouri companies of emigrants and when they started out they  had such strife one with another in trying to start first. They did not  stop to milk their cows and in clearning up their breakfast they strewed their  meal salt bacon short cake beans and other things upon the ground  throughout their encampment and when we came up 3 wolves were feeding  upon the fragments.    In coming over the hills today we found it  so cold it pierced us like Winter. On reaching the Valley we found  fires the companies in advance had built and we pilled on the wood  and soon got warm. An antelope lay before us which the hunters  had brought in. We carved it up with our knives forked it on  sticks roasted it and satisfied ourselves finely without the seasoning  of salt.    We started in the morning at 5 o'clock  into better feed a mile further on and turned out our teams. The  brethren did some trading with the hunters who camped near us.    At 7 o'clock 15 of our waggons was formed  into a company to go forward to make a boat to ferry the Platte.  They went forward and we followed them and the traders started at   the same time.    Soon another party of traders overtook us  who were direct from Santa Fee. They informed us that the Mormon  Battalion was at California went in Jan and that Capt. Brown was 
 in Santa Fee for money for the detachment and would come on us soon as possible.    In the afternoon of the next day Presidents Young  and Kimball rode with us. Our detached company had not been heard  of since last night when they camped with the foremost company. We  camped this night at Deer Creek had good feed and our horses and cattle  were gaining daily.    Ch. 28    I examined a splendid grinding stone quary  on the East side of the road as it leaves the hills and strikes the Platte and  Brother Carrington found a very excellent coal bed on Deer Creek. The  specimens produced were good.    At the blowing of the horn at night I did  not feel much like retiring to bed so I walked half a mile  from the camp on the bank of Deer Creek and found brother  William Clayton fishing with a hook. He had caught two  dozen good fish they resembled the eastern herring. Another brother  had also caught some. As they were about to leave they left  their lines for me to fish with.    So I sat down for half an hour musing  alone as unconcered as though I had been on the banks of  Farmington River in my native place when suddenly I heard  a rustling in the bushes near me and for the first time the thought  flushed across me that I was in a country abounding with the  grizly Bear wolves and Indians and was liable to an attack at  any moment from either of them away from my company and  no weapon to defend myself against even a Badger. I thought it  wisdom to return to camp and picking up my fishing rods I walked  leasurely home and retired to rest.    Next day we rode our horses during our  journey several times into the river to find a fording place but  could not. Our detached company was reported at the ferry  ten miles or so above us. Our hunters brought in 13 antelopes  and the Msisssourian Company killed 3 Buffalo.    I started on the following morning 
 to go forward in company with brother A. P. Rockwood who was riding President [Brigham Young|Young's  steed when suddenly he sprang upon my horse but instead of striking him he took  my knee into his jaw and brused me considerably sinking one tooth to the bone  through three thickness of clothing and one of them buckskin.    George A Smith and myself then rode on to the  Ferrying place and found our detachment ferrying over the Missourian company  who paid the brethren $1.50 cts for each waggon and load and paid in flour  at $2.50 cts per cwt. while flour through this country was worth at least  10 dollars per cwt.    It was very difficult to get over the river. They  carried the goods over in a boat but drew the waggons over the ropes by  hand but when the current struck them they would frequently roll over  several times in the water and they came near drowning their horses. One  of the men would have been lost had not the brethren picked him up  with the boat. On the road the Missouri company had a run away ^stampede^  of their teams turning over their waggons brusing women and children and  smashing their things and one ran into the river and would probably have  drowned and lost all had not a little boy jumped out beside the off  ox which frightened him and he "hawed off" and ran on to a sand bank  dragging the others with him. The boy was knocked over into the  water and hurt but the scene ended without any loss of life.    Our blacksmiths had been to work for the  Missouri company for which they got flour money &c and our  hunters had been busily engaged. They had killed 5 fat  buffalo one old she bear and 3 cubs and shot at 2 grizly bear but  did not get them. Those killed were black bear. Our hunters  also brought into camp 8 antelope.    Sunday was a very warm day and the camp  met for prayer meeting at 9 o'clock and at 10 we had a preaching  meeting. President Kimball first addressed the meeting and  was followed by President Young who remarked upon the great  difference between us as a camp and the Missourian companies  who were travelling the same road. He said, "They curse swear 
 rip and tare and are trying to swallow up the earth but though they do not  wish us to have a place on it the Earth will soon open and swallow them  up and they will go to the land of forgetfulness while the Saints if  faithful though they suffer some privations here will ultimately inherit  the earth and increase in power dominion and glory."    He spake much to our edification and was followed  by Elder O Pratt and afterwards the meeting dismissed and the Twelve  colonels captains &c of the camp met at President Young's waggon and  consulted upon the measures to be adopted to get across the river. It  was finally agereed to go immediately to the mountains with waggons  and teams and for every two Tens to get polls and lash two or four  waggons abreast to keep them from turning over and float them  across the river with boats and ropes. So a company of horsemen  started for the mountains and teams to draw the poles.    In the evening the flour meal and bacon  were distributed through the camp equally which had been earned from  the Missouri company for ferrying them over. It amounted to 5 1/2 lbs  of flour 2 lbs of meal and a small piece of bacon for each individual  in the camp. It looked as much of a miracle to me to see our flour  and meal bags replenished in the midst of the Black Hills as it did  to have the children of Israel fed with manna in the Wilderness. But  the Lord has been truly with us on our journey and wonderfully preserved  and blessed us.    At daylight next morning the two first two  Tens were called together to make arrangements for crossing. Some of  our party did not like the mode proprosed to lash the waggons together  as the current was so strong so we appointed brother Grover as our  Captain to direct the rafting and concluded to put our poles into a raft  and carry our goods over in a boat and ford our waggons on the raft.    We commenced at 5 o'clock in the morning and   in four hours we had landed eleven waggon loads of goods upon the  North Shore with our little leather boat and during the day we got   over all the waggons belonging to our Tens being eleven waggons in all 
 The rest of the encampment being twelve Tens only got  over the same number of waggons as ourselves. They floated their waggons by  tying from two to four together but the waggons turned clean over each other  bottom side up and back again breaking the bows covers and boxes to pieces  and loasing ploughs axes and iron left in the boxes.    Most of our company was in the water from  morning till night and all was very weary when the work was done.    Just has we had drawn Dr. Richards' two waggons  to the shore and loaded his goods into them when a storm struck us. I sprang  into my carriage tied all down tight and laid out my whole strength in  holding my waggon cover on but the rain wind and hail beat so  heavily that it was a task and my bed and things were nearly drenched  It only lasted seven minutes but was severe on our waggons and goods  and our horses ran two or three miles in the storm. I crossed the  river went after them tied them up and returned weary but had some  pleasant dreams at night.    I felt unwell next day from the exposures   of yesterday and with the teeth ache with which I had suffered much  on my pioneer journey. It was very windy to day and our companies  crossed the river very slowly. Another Missouri company had  come up with us.    President Young thought it wisdom to leave  a number of the brethren here with ^until^ our companies deigning to follow us  come up and for them to keep a Ferry for the emigrants on the road  not of our people who would pay $1.50 cts per waggon in flour at  $2.00 cts per cwt and cows at $10.    The brethren made two new rafts on the  third day of our fording the river and got quite a number of our  Pioneer waggons over. I was still unwell but in company with  Orson Pratt I went on to some of the Bluffs to view the country  and shot one antelope. This was the first antelope I ever killed.    We had some heavy squals of wind and rain  and in the evening many of us went over the river and tied up our horses 
 and when one company was returning in the leather boat it half filled and they  came nearly sinking.    Early on the following morning we swam our  horses over and one mule was nearly drowned by being tangled in a rope but  the current carried him ashore.    Twenty men the day before went down the  river to dig out two large canoes to cover over and make a Ferry boat.  The emigrants were arriving daily at our Fording place and they reported  one thousand waggons between there and Laramie. This was the  5 6th day spent in ferrying our Pioneer company across the river but now  we had succeeded in getting all over and once more formed our waggons  into a circle. Over brethren crossed some of the Missourians also and  ran their boat all night in ferrying them.    Next day also we were still ferrying the   Gentiles and another large company arrived. We gathered our cattle at  10 o'clock and harnessed but did not start as all were not ready to   we turned out our teams again    In the afternoon we heald a council and  resolved to leave 9 men to tend the Ferry to ford emigrant compaies  and also our own brethren who should come after us. The men were  chosen and we met with them again in the evening. President Young  rebuked one who hepettioned to stay but whom he wished to continue on  with us. He also instructed the brethren who were to tarry to keep  together and divide their means accumulated equally according to their  labour for each to esteem his brother as himself in no wise to   retain that which belonged to the traveller to be careful of the lives  and property of those they ferried to forget not their prayers and to come  up after us with the next company of Saints.    The brethren to remain at the Ferry were  Thomas Grover, captain; John S. Higby Luke Johnson William Empy  Edmund Elsworth Benjamin F. Stewart Francis Pomeroy James  Davenport and Appleton Harmon    After 7 days tarry we continued our 
 journey travelled during the day 21 1/2 miles and had the most wretched camping ground  at night we had found on the way. President Young thought it might be properly called  hell-gate.  The country abounded with alkaline and the water was disgustingly  naucious. Our horses and cattle being thirstly drank some and left it and some  of the cattle got badly mired in the marshes. Our hunters brought in one  buffalo 1 deer and 3 antelope.    Early on the Sunday morning we hitched up without  feed or water and left our encampment of death poison-waters and alkaline  marshes and drove 3 miles to a good campground and sweet water. This was  on the Willow Spring branch about 3  miles from the head.    We bated 2 hours and took breakfast and  President Young wished me to go on about 15 miles and look up a camp  ground for the night. So I went forward and George A Smith with  me to the head of the Willow Spring. Here he stoped with a doctor  of a Missourian company who had been attending a sick family to  wait for our waggons to come up and I rode on alone    After travelling alone several miles brother John   Brown came up with me and we rode on together over a sandy barren sage  country to a creek of good water about 10 miles west of the Willow Springs  We arrived here at half past 1 o'clock, and turned out our horses to bait.    Here we tarried till four o'clock watching for  our waggons to come in sight but we could see no waggons. At length  two horsemen were seen approaching and we waved a small flag for  them to come to us supposing they were of our company but they turned  out to be two hunters of the Missouri companies carrying in buffalo  meat to their camp. In the distance they thought we were Indians  and made off.    I mounted my horse and put after them and  soon overtook them and made inquiries concerning our company. They  said they had not seen it but had seen about a dozen waggons  coming by themselves.    I then concluded that our camp had stoped  at the Willow Springs and so Captain Smith one of the hunters and who was the leader 
 of the Missouri ^Co^ invited us to go on and camp with them for the night as they did not  expect to go more than a few miles further than the Creek we were now  on. We could see five miles on the road back and no waggons  were in sight and as it was now five o'clock I concluded our company  would not come on and if they did they would go no farther than  the Creek.    We accepted Captain Smith's proposal and  went on with him to spend the night with his camp but instead of  journying only a mile or so he continued on mile after mile finding  neither feed nor water excepting salt and alkaline grounds until we struck  the Sweet Water river at Independence Rock so noted already in Fremont's  Journal and by other travellers. This was 12 miles from the Creek  before spoken of.    The Sweet Waters were sweet indeed both  to man and beast after travelling thorough so much alkiline country  and there was good feed around.    After a good supper of bacon buffalo corn  bread coffee milk &c I laid down in a tent with the Missourians but  did not rest well. I found there was a great difference between  these Missouri emigrant companies and our own where there was  no such thing as cursing swearing quarrelling contending with  other companies &c allowed or practised.    But to return to our Pioneer company. At  a late hour they came up to the Creek which we had left 12 miles  back and grass being poor continued on 4 miles West of the creek  and camped for the night. Not finding me at the creek nor hearing  from me at all they felt somewhat alarmed lest I was lost or had got  into trouble with the Indians. They blew the bugle and watched  for me till midnight and finally fired the cannon while I was  camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I was giving them  any trouble. I travelled this day a distance of thirty miles  and our Pioneer company 20 miles. 
 Independance Rock  Reached by the Pioneers  June 21 1847    I arose early this morning took breakfast and in company with  Brother Brown rode clear round Independance Rock. We examined the many  names and lists of names of the trappers traders travellers and emigrants nearby  all in black red and yellow paint on this rock. Some had washed out and  defaced. The greatest number was put on within a few years but we  found some of thirty years standing. Nearly all the companies who  pass put their names on. this rock    After going around and examining it we  staked our horses and mounted it. I went forward and gained the  highest point of the south and of the Rock which contains the names. I  then went to the North end which is the highest point of Independance  Rock. Here is an opening or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons  and a rock standing upon the highest peak of about 3 tons weight    Upon this rock at the highest point we climbed  and offered up our prayers according to the order of the Priesthood praying  earnestly for the blessing of God to rest on President Young and his  brethren the Twelve and all the Pioneer camp, the whole camp and  House of Israel in the wilderness our wives children and relatives, the   Mormon Battelion and the Churches abroad. While offering up our  prayers the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us.    I was the First Latter-day Saint on Independance Rock    We had a view of our camp from the Rock and  expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses and  concluded to examine the country around. We rode five  miles to the North East went on to the top of a high bluff and 
 saw our camp in motion. We than rode to the foot of the mountain  and traced the way to the    Devil's Gate    through which the Sweet Water runs. Here we spent but a few  moments and then hurried back to Indipendence Rock. As our camp  had come up before we could get to them and camped half a mile East  of the Rock it.    I met President Young going up to Independence  Rock and I related to him my travels since I left the company. He  asked me to go back with him so I turned out my horse having rode  him twenty miles during the forenoon and returned with President Young  Willard Richards George A Smith and others. We spent half  an hour on the Rock and then returned to our camp mounted our horses  and rode to the Devil's Gate, five miles from Indipendence  Rock    We rode as far as we could into the Gate  hitched our horses and walked into about the centre of the cavern    The Devils Gate is 400 feet high, perpendicular  rocks, 120 feet wide and 50 rods long and the water rushes through  it with a roar. The rocks are course grey granite with a vein of  black trap rock running through. We spent about half an hour here  and then had to back our horses out and rode around it on the  South Side. Some of the footmen walked over the top of it. We  camped for the night about one mile west of the Devil's Gate on the  bank of the Sweet Water.    A Guide Board was put up at Devils Gate  stating that it was 175 1/4 miles from Fort Laramie and 50 1/4 from  our Ferry of the Platte River.    Two more Missourian companies overtook  us at noon on our next day's travel and they informed us that a  man was drowned at the Ferry after we left in trying to swim his 
 horses and they had not found his body.    The camp started on again after our company had nooned  but brothers Young Little Benson and myself went back to meet Lorenzo Young  who had broken an abxletree of his waggon and we were behind all the  afternoon.    After a journey of 20 3/4 miles the Pioneers camped  at night at the foot of a mound about 200 feet high on the bank of Sweet Water  Brother Kimball and myself went to the top of it and looked down upon the camp  and it appeared to us delightful. We offered up our prayers and the Srpitrit  of the Lord rested up us and then we decended to the camp. The moon  was shining beautifully. On the 24th the best horse in camp President Young's was shot by accident.    The South Pass Reached  June the 26    On the evening of the 26 after a travel of 18 3/4 miles we camped  opposite the table rock and near the summit of the South Pass. I  was quite astonished at the road and country to day considering we  were crossing the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains it was the best  road we had travelled over for many days and had it not been for  the wide river ^Wind River^ range of mountains in full view of our right covered with  eternal snow and some snow banks 10 feet deep by the side of the  road as we passed along with the table rock on the left I should almost  have thought myself travelling over the beautiful prairies of Illinois and  Missouri excepting that the country was covered with more sage than  prairie grass. The road for many miles and also the plain  of beautiful grass lying North of the table rock were strewn with  very handsome cornelian stones. I saw more in one hour this evening  than ever before during my whole ^life travels^ either in the rude state or polished  and set in breast pins &c in all the jewellers shops I ever saw in my  travels    Elders Kimball, Pratt, G. A Smith & Brown  had gone to take observations on the dividing ridge and they 
 continued on to the Green River 7 miles from us which runs into the Pacific  while we were on the Sweet Waters that run into the Altantic. They  supposed that we should come on to them and as they did not return  several of us mounted our horses to go in search of them but we soon  met brother Kimball returning and he informed us that the rest of  brethren would camp on the Green River with some men from Oregon on their way to the States    June the 27 1847 was the day 3 years from  the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith    It was Sunday morning but we harnessed  up our teams and drove to where brothers Pratt and Smith had camped  with Major Harris who had been travelling through Oregon and California  for 25 years and had much acquaintance with the Country. He brought  a file of Oregon papers and one published by S. Brannon of  California. We had much conversation with him and  he spoke unfavourably of the Salt Lake Country for a settlement.  but spoke of other places not far off that were good    Meeting with Mr. Bridger    We parted with Major Harris next day after doing some  trading with him and in our afternoon's travel met Mr Bridger of  the fort on the way with two men going to Fort Laramie. He  was expecting us and wished to have an interview with President Young  and the Twelve and we also wished to have an interview with him   so we immediately returned to the Creek upon which we had  nooned and camped for the night and Mr. Bridger and his men  camped with us.    We met in council with Mr Bridger and  spent some hours in conversation and found him to have been a great  traveller and had ^professed^ an extensive knowledge of nearly all Oregon and  Californiaâ€”the mountains lakes rivers springs valleys mines ore &c  He spoke more highly of the Great Basin for a settlement than 
 Major Harris had done said that it was his paradise and that if this people  settled in it he wanted to settle with them. He said that there was but one thing  that could operate against its becoming a great grain country and that would  be frost for he did not know but the frost might affect the corn. He conversed  with us about a great variety of subjects connected with the country said he was  ashamed of the maps of Fremont and that he knew nothing about the country only  the plain travelled road and that he could correct all the maps published  of the Western world.    We parted next day from Mr. Bridger who   remarked that it would not be prudent to bring a great population  to the Bason until we ascertained whether grain would grow or  not. O. P. Rockwell and myself went forward to pick out  a camp ground. It was fifteen miles from where we nooned before  we could get grass and this made the longest day's journey we had  travelled on the whole route making 23 3/4 miles.    We travelled 8 miles on the last day of June  and camped on the bank of the Green River at the Ferry and the afternoon  was spent in building a raft as the river was high and could only be crossed  upon rafts or boats.    During the afternoon the arrival of Elder Samuel S. Brannan from the bay of San Francisco was anounced in camp  and we were glad to meet with him to hear from the Saints who went  with him. He gave us an account of their landing their travels  and present settlement which was two hundred miles up the river from  the bay and they were putting in wheat and building up their place.    During the two three following days we were  fording Green River. On the afternoon of the second the Twelve  held a council and four men were appointed to return and meet the  Camp of Israel and pioliot them up. We each wrote our voices concerning  the counsel to be given to the camp. I wrote a letter next day  to my father A. O. Smoot and John Benbow to be taken back by the  pilots. The ferrying was finished on the evening of  the third day and we moved on three miles and camped. 
 Indipendance Day  July 4th  The Return of the First Detachment of the Mormon Battalion    The Fourth of July came on Sunday. I accompanied Presidents  Young Kimball and Richards witand others with the pilots to the Ferry to  put them across and when we arrived at the river we saw 13 horseman  on the opposite bankwith their baggage on one of our rafts. But to our  great joy who should they be but our brethren of the Mormon Battalion  belonging to Captain Brown's detachment who had been at Pueblo  during the Winter. Amasa Lyman whom we had sent  unto them had reached them with information of our movements and  the whole detachment of 140 of the brethren were within seven days drive of us.    When we met these brethren it was truly  a hearty greeting and shaking of hands. We crossed them all over  the river excepting one who returned with our pilots to meet  the following companies of the Saints. This small detachment  of the Battalion had about a dozen of their horses stolen by some  horse thieves but they overtook them and got them all back but  two which had gone on to Bridger.    We left Green River (the head waters of   the Colerado) on the 5th drove 20 miles and camped on Black's   Fork There was neither feed nor water between this place and Green River but simileer to the last 200 miles a sandy desert  covered with sagebrush.    Next evening we camped on the west  side of Hams Fork which we crossed on the following day and  drove to Fort Bridger. In the region of the fort before we got  on to our camping ground we crossed more than a dozzen trout  brooks the water running swiftly but clear with hard cold gravelly  buttons and the whole region of country up and down these. 
 streams was covered with grass a knee deep.    The brethren caught several brook trout which was  the first I had seen since I left England and as we were to spend the next day at  the Fort I calculated upon a day of fishing. So as soon as I had my breakfast  next morning I rigged up my trout rod that I had brought with me from Liverpool  fixed my reel line and artificial fly and went to one of the brooks close by  to try my luck.    The men at the Fort said that there were but  very few trout in the streams and a good many of the brethren were already  at the creeks with their rods trying their skill baiting with fresh meat  and grasshoppers but no one was catching any.    I went and threw my fly into the water and  it being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in America  or ever saw it tried I watched it as it floated upon the water  with as much interest as Franklin did his kite string so was I highly  gratified when I saw the nimble trout dart at my fly hook himself  and run away with the line but I soon worried him out and  drew him to shore.    I fished two or three hours during the  morning and evening and caught twelve in all. One half of them  would weigh 3/4 lbs each while all the rest of the camp did not  catch 3 lbs in all which was proof positive that the artificial fly is  far the best to fish with.    In the afternoon I went to Bridger's  house and traded off my flint lock riffle for four buffalo ecalves  which were large nice and well dressed. At this fort I found  things generally at least one thir[ink blot] higher than I had ever met at  any anyother trading post I ever saw in Amerdica.    I arose in the morning quite unwell  and felt threatened with the camp Mountain fever yet I mounted my  horse and rode till ten o'clock but before I started I was called. 
 upon to administer to Bro Carter who was taken with the fever. There were  new cases of the Mountain fever every day in camp. At ten  o'clock I had to give up and take to my bed in the waggon with distressing  pain in my head back joint bones marrow and all through my system  attended with cold chills and hot flashes through the body and we travelled  over 13 miles of as bad road as any we had on our journey which made  it exceedingly painful to the sick. the day seemed very long to me.  When we stoped at night I took composition cayeene and a dose  of vegitable pills had a better night than I expecetd and though  I was febeble in the morning I felt my fever was broken  up and I recovering.    After this We camped for the night on  the 10th 1 1/2 miles from Bear River by the best stream of water  we had found on the route and a small stream near by and  We had travelled this day up and down steep hills and passed through  a valley six miles long grass knee deep strong mineral springs  copper lead coal and lime.    Camp fires were discovered about 3  miles from our camping ground and Georg A Smith and  others went over to them and found it to be a Mr. Miles  Gooydyier. He had settled at Salt Lake and had a garden and  vegitation he said doing well. Several Missourians were with  with him going to the States.    The subject was brought up concerning  the emigrant company who perished in the Mountains last Winter.  They were mostly from Indipendence and Clay counties Missouri  and were a mob company that threatened to drive out the  Mormons who were in California and started with that spirit  in their hearts. But it seemed as though they were  ripe for judgement. The snows fell upon them 18 feet  deep on a level and they died and eat up each other. About  40 persons perished and were mostly eaten up by those who  survived them. Mrs L. Murphy of Tenn. whom I 
 baptized while on a mission in that country but since apostatized and joined  the mob was in that company and died or was killed and eaten up and her  bones sawed to pieces for her bones brains and marrow and left strewed upon the  ground.    We spent the Sunday in camp but some of the  brethren rode out to seek out the road and found a tar spring about 15  miles South of our camp.    Early on the Monday morning I rode to Bear  River and for the first time I saw the long looked for    Bear River Valley    The spot where we struck it was not very interesting. There was  considerable grass in the valley and some timber and thick brushes  on the bank of the river. My object in riding to the river before  the camp was to try my luck in fishing for trout. After  fishing for several hours I started after the camp having  caught 8 trout in all.    The camp had travelled 9 miles and   nooned in a valley. I found President Young very sick with  the fever. The company had started on but President Young  being so sick concluded not to move from where he was. Brothers  Kimball Benson Rockwood and others staid with him with  their waggons    We drove without any road over hills  and dales having to make our road as we went along. We camped  at night l in Mathews Valley by the side of Reddings Cave. The valleys  were beginning to grow more fertile and the air more pacific.    I arose quite unwell in the morning. Several brethren  went to meet President Young, and the camp laid still waiting for him to  come up. Brother Kimball came at noon and a council of the whole  was called and it was resolved that Orson Pratt take a company of ^about^ 20  waggons and 40 men and go on to the Kanyon and make a road as 
 they went along and if they could not go through Kanyon to find Smith's cutoff  and make a road over the mountain so that we need not be hindered when we  came along. There were 23 waggons in all that started at 1'oclock.    We had found but little game for many days  until yesterday when the Hunters brought in 12 antelope and 10 to day.    President Young was better to day but designed not  to move until to morrow. In the afternoon I walkedrode out with Elder Richards  in search of springs of water.    Next In the morning I rode back 7 miles to visit  President Young and found him much better in health and quite cheerful  The evening before Dr Richards myself and George A Smith went before  the Lord to pray for brother Young and we had a testimony that he  would recovered from that hour. I found brother Rockwood the sickest  man that had been in our company. I tarried until near night assisting  the camp ^sick^ and then returned back to our encampment.    I started early in the morrow with my  carriage and horses to go back for President Young and brother Rockwood  I was two hours driving 7 miles to their camp. I found them much  better and they thought they could ride as my carriage was the easiest  vehicle in our company. I made up a bed and took them both into  my carriage and the rest of the waggons started and drove to the main  body and the sick seemed refreshed with their ride. After a short halt  the whole company drove 4 1/2 miles and camped for the night    Next day I again took Brothers Young  and Rockwood in my carriage and drove them during the day. We  had bad road for the sick and brother Brigham was wearied out and   worse at night. I went to Weber's Fork 1 mile from our encampment  at night and caught a trout for him.    He was still sick in the morning and after  we had driven three miles on to Weber's Fork we camped the remainder  of the day in consequence of President Young being worse. The Twelve  and others went out and prayed for him and the sick according to  the order of the Priesthood. 
 Sunday the 18th was spent holding meeting and on the morrow  morning 41 waggons went on among whom were Dr Richards and George A. Smith.  15 waggons remained with President Young and two of mine were of the number.    and In company with Heber C. Kimball E. T. Benson  and Howard Egan I rode over the mountain called Pratt's Pass with the company  that went on an then returned to President Young.    Next morning we started early and stoped for breakfast  after a five miles drive. I carried brother Brigham in my carriage. The  fever was still on him but he stood the ride well.    After breakfast we travelled 10 miles over the worse  road of the whole journey. Our camping ground this night was on a trout  creek. Here we found 3 waggons had tarried in consequence of the  sick. Brothers Sherwood Johnson and Dewey were so sick they  could not journey and we camped with them and baptized them for  their sickness and I confirmed them. This morning brother Pratt's company  were only 8 miles farther on than where where we camped at night.    We remained in camp next day in consequence  of sickness. The stream we were on was Ogdon's Fork ^We were on East Kanyon Creek^ and the route we  were taking was Reed's Pass which we named Pratt's Pass in consequence of  his going on to make the road.    Next day 8 miles were made of our journey and  East Kaynon^nyon^ Creek the camping place. It was 8 miles of the worst of  roads and Brother Case smasshed one of his hind wheels to pieces and we  had to wait 2 hours to bring his waggon up. The sick stood the journey  better than we expected during the day considering the bad road.    We left East Kayno^nyo^n Creek on the 23rd and  travelled to the West five miles up hill which brought us to the summit  and then descended the mountain 6 miles through a thick timbered grove  The timber had been cut out of the road yet it was full of stumps and  it kept each teamster very busy to dogdge the stumps and not break  his waggon. One man turned over his ox waggon and smashed  the tops all to pieces. There were two children in the waggon but  they were not hurt. 
 We nooned at a beautiful spring in a small birch grove  There was more timber during this half days travel than we had seen in a month and  the valleys both ascending and descending were extremely fertile and covered with vegitation  to the tops of the hills    At the spring where we nooned we were met by  brothers Pack and Mathews from the forward camps. They brought a  letter to us & informed us that it was only 10 miles to the Valley of the  Great Salt Lake or Great Basin and 14 to their camp. They   had explored the country as far as possible and made choice of a spot to  put in crops.    After nooning we travelled up another very  tedious hill and down into a valley and camped for the night.    Great Salt Lake Valley  Reached by the Pioneers  July the 24, 1847    This was an important day in the history of my life and in  the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    After travelling from our encampment 6  miles through the deep ravine valley ending with the Kayynyon we   came in full view of the Valley of the Great Salt Lake or the Great  Basionâ€”the Land of Promise held in reserve by the hand of God for  a resting place for the Saints.    We gazed with wonder and admiration  upon the vast fertile Valley spread out before us for about 25 miles  and 16 in wedth clothed with a heavy garment of vegitation and in the  midst of which glistened the waters of the Great Salt Lake with  mountains all around lowering to the skys and streams rivllulets  and creeks of pure water running through the beautiful valley. 
 After a hard journey from Winter Quarters of 1200 miles  through flats of the Platte River and steeps of the Black Hills and Rocky  Mountains and over the burning sands and eternal sage regions willow swails  and rocky kayn^ny^ions to gaze upon a valley of such vast extent surrounded with  a perfect chain of everlasting mountains covered with eternal snow with their  innumerable peaks like pyramids towering towards heaven presented at one  view to us the grandest scenery and prospect that we could have obtained on  earth. Thoughts of pleasant meditations ran in rapid succession  through our minds at the anticipation that not many years hence the  House of God would be established in the mountains and exalted above  the hills while the valleys would be converted into orchards vineyards  and fields & planted with cities and the standard of Zion be unfurled for  the nations to gather.    Ch. 29    President Young expressed his full satisfaction  in the appearence of the Valley as a resting place for the Saints and was  amply repaid for his journey ^and while tarying upon his bed in my carriage gazing upon the scene before him many things of the future concerning the valley was shown to him in vision.^    After gazing awhile upon the scenery before  us we travelled across the table land 4 miles into the Valley to the  encampment of our brethren who had arrived two days before us. They  had pitched upon the bank of two small streams of pure water and had  commenced plowing and broken about 5 acres of ground. They had also  began planting potatoes; and as soon as we were formed into the   encampment before I took my dinner having 1/2 bushel of potatoes  I went to the plowed field and planted them hoping with the blessing  of God to save at least the seed for another year. The brethren  had damed up one of the Creeks and dug a trench and by night nearly  the whole ground which was found very dry was irrigated.    Towards evening brothers Kimball Smith  Benson and myself rode several miles up the creek into the mountains  to look for timber see the country &c.    There was a thunder shower and it rained nearly over the whole valley. It also rained some in the fore  part of the night. We felt thankful for this as it was 
 the general conceived opinion that it did not rain in the Valley during the  Summer season.    The First Sunday In The Valley  July 25th    This was the first Sunday the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints spent in the Great Salt Lake Valley. We  shaved and cleaned up and met in the circle of the encampment  Meeting was opened by the Bishops and    George A Smith Preached the First Sermon    It was an interesting discourse. Heber C. Kimball and E. T. Benson  followed.    After an intermission of two hours the Church   met again at 2 o'clock and the Bishops broke bread to the  congregation. I then addressed the brethren and was followed by   Orson Pratt and Willard Richards. Several other brethren also expressed  their feelings and all expressed the universal satisfaction with the Valley  and were joyfully disappointed at the whole prospect.    At the close of the meeting President Young   though feeble addressed the congregation for a few moments. He  informed the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that  they would loose five times as much as they would gain by it.  None were to hunt or fish on that day and there should not any man  dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might go  and dwell where they pleased but should not dwell with us. He  said that no man should buy any land who came here that he had  none to sell neither should he buy any but every man should  have his land measured out to him for city and farming purposes  He might till it as he pleased but he must be industrious and  take care of it. 
 On the Monday the camp in general was busily engaged  in ploughing and planting corn and other seeds. Ten men were chosen for an    Exploring Expedition through the Valley    I took President Young into my carriage and travelled two miles towards the  mountain and made choice of a spot of ground for our garden with a small  rivlet running through it which I named garden Creek.    We then returned to camp and went North about  five miles and we all went to the top of a high peak on the edge of  the mountain which we considered a good place to raise an ensign. To  we named it Ensign Peak    I was the first person who ascended this hill  which we had thus named. Brother Young was very weary in climbing  being feeble from his recent fever.    We descended to the Valley and started North to  visit the hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink  of cold water and then went back 4 miles to the Springs, and then  returned to the camp quite weary. Brothers Mathews and Brown  had crossed the Valley in the narrowest place opposite the camp to  the West mountain and found it ^about^ 15 miles    Next morning brother Amasa Lyman came  into camp and informed us that Brown's detatchment of the Mormon  Battalion would be with us in about two days.    We again started on our exploring expedition  Brother Lyman and all of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve  in camp being 8 in number were of the company. Six others of the  brethren were with us among whom was Brannon from San Francisco.    Visit to the Salt Lake    We started for the purpose of visiting the Salt Lake and mountain  on the west of the Valley. We travelled two miles west from 
 Temple Block and came to the Utah outlet of the Utah Lake thence 14 miles  to the West Mountain and found that the land was not near so fertile on the  west side of the Valley as on the East and but little fresh water as far  as we went while the East side of the Valley was as well watered. as any  land I ever saw.    We took our dinner at the fresh water pool  and then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the Salt Lake where  we made a halt and we all went into the Salt water. It was quite   warm and inpregnated with as much salt as could possibly be dissolved  in water. No person could sink in it but would float and roll  on the top like a dry log. While standing to our waist in water  we could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top like  cork. The whole body of the water would make at least 3 pints  of the best white salt to one gallon of water. There was a lot of  beautiful white salt on the shore. We concluded that the Salt  Lake was one of the wonders of the world. After spending  an hour here we rode south on the Lake shore about 4 miles  and then returned 10 miles to our place of nooning. The whole  distance of the day was 40 miles.    We arose refreshed by sleep in the open  and having lost my carriage whip the night before I started  in the morning on horseback to go after it.    As I got near the place where it was droped  two objects appeared before me about half mile distant whom I took  at first for bears but after approaching a little nearer I discovered   about 20 Indians and as I was unharmed I did not consider it  prudent to go among them so I wheeled about my horse and started  on my return at a slow trot.    As soon as I started back they called  to me and one mounted his horse and came after me with all speed  When he got within 20 rods of me I stoped and met him and the   rest followed on. I found them to be Utes and that they  wanted to trade. I informed him by signs that our camp 
 was near so he went on with me to camp. From what we had yet seen of the Utahs  they appeared friendly though they had a bad name from the Mountaineers.  The Indian wanted to smoke the pipe of peace with us but we soon started on  and he waited for his company to come up.    We travelled about 10 miles South under the  mountain on the West side of the Valley. The land beautiful but  we could not find any water and not as good soil as on the East. Thence  we turned our course towards the Pioneer encampment which we reached  weary after a journey through the day of 30 miles. We saw on the West  side of the Valley about a hundred goats sheep antelope &c playing  about the hills and Valley.    The Temple Block Selected  July the 18th 1847    After our return to the camp President Young called   a council of the Quorum of the Twelve. There were present  Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt Willard Richards  Wilford Woodruf George A Smith Amasa Lyman and E. T.  Benson    We walked from the North camp to about  the centre between the two creeks when President Young waved  his hands and said here is the 40 acres for the Temple and the city  can be laid out perfectly square North and South East and West. We  had conversed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this.    It was then moved and carried that the Temple  Lot contain 40 acres on the ground where we stood. It was also moved  and carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each exclusive  of the streets and into blocks of 8 lots each being 10 acres in each block and  one and a quarter in each lot.    It was further moved and carried that each street  be laid out 8 rods wide and that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet  wide and that each house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the  front line that there night be a uniformity throughout the city. 
 President Young remarked that he wished but one house  be built upon a lot and they being in the centre if they took fire they would not  burn up their neighbours and if any man wanted a market to have it upon  his own lot and not to lay out public grounds for a market place. Let every man  cultivate his own lot and set out every kind of fruit trees and shade trees and beautify  the city.    It was moved and carried that there be four  Public Squares of 10 acres each to be laid out in various parts of the City for  Public Grounds. This was in Lot 40Â° 45 44.    At 8 o'clock the whole camp came together on the  same ground and passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded and  when the business part of the meeting was closed President Young arosed and   addressed the assembly upon a varity of subjects.    In his remarks President Young remarked that he   was determined to have all things in order and righteousness should be practised  in the land. We had come here according to the direction and counsel  of brother Joseph Smith before his death and that he would still have been  alive if the Twelve had been in Nauvoo when he re-crossed the river from  Montrose to Nauvoo.    He spoke of the Saints being driven from place  to place and said the only way Boggs Clark Lucas Benton and all the leaders  of the mob could be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntarily and let their heads be cut off and let their  blood run upon the ground and go up as a smoking inscense before the  Heavens as an atonement but now they will be eternally damned.    All the Presidents and Governors of the United  States had rejected all our petitions from first to last. When the Saints  were driven from Illinois to perish on the prairies then President Polk  sends for a draft of 500 men to go into the army. What for? That  they might be worasted away and their wives and children he wasted  away that we might be entirely wasted away as a people. If the  brethren had not gone they would have made war upon us and the  Governor of Missouri would have been ordered not to let us cross the 
 Missouri. The raising of the Battalion was our temporal salvation at the time.    Polk will be damned for this act. He with many of the  Government had a hand in the death of Joseph and Hyrum and we will never cease our  exertions until the blood of the Prophets and Saints is avenged.    He said that he intended to have every hole and corner from  the Bay of San Francisco to Hudson Bay known to us, and many more things he  spoke of important to our people.    Arrival of the Mormon Battalion  July the 29, 1847.    President Young with his brethren the Twelve and others  mounted our horses and started to meet the Battalion under the command  of Captain Brown.    Some of them were met about 4 miles from camp  and we continued on and soon met with Capts Brown Higgins Liut. Willis and  the train following them and I met brother Bevin who went from my family  into the army. There were about 140 of the Battalion and a company  of about 100 of the Mississippie Saints that came with them from Pueblo  being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses & mules and 300 head of cattle which  added greatly to our numbers.    We had a heavy shower of rain while we were  in the Kanyon which sent the water in the creeks from the mountains  with a rush and roar like thunder resembling the opening of a flood gate  The first rush of water came down with a front 3 feet high. The shower  spread over a good share of the Valley where we were settled.    We returned at the head of the companies and  marched into camp with music and they took up their quarters between  our two camps on the bank of the creek.    While we had been exploring the rest of the  Pioneers had been farming putting in potatoes corn beans peas buckwheat  and preparing a garden for garden seeds. Today our garden was 
 divided off as each had need.    In the evening Brother Young and the Twelve went to   the Warm Springs and bathed    Next day we met in Council â€” the Twelve  Capts  Brown Higgins Willis and others and heard the statement of the officers  concerning the Battalion and their situation and counsel was given by  President Young what course to persue    It was deemed wisdom for Capt Brown   and others to go to the Bay of San Francisco and report himself  men and the State and brother Brannan was to go as their pilot    After the Council broke up we mounted  our horses and rode to the Warm Springs and visited the Hot Sulpher  Spring and on our return I visited the Battalion and then the planting  ground and found some of our potatoes had rotted and some were coming  up. Our corn was also up and our beans.    At 8 o'clock oin the evening all the  camp met together and was addressed for more than an hour by  President Young. He expressed his feelings freely concerning  the treatment of the Government towards us as on the 28th.    The meeting opened by the assembly with  a shout of Hosannah to God and the Lamb repeated three times  with its Amen. Brother Young said the Ancient of Days  was not as far off as many supposed.    On the Saturday the Battalion went to   work at the Bowery and our Camp of Pioneers sowing and planting.    At About noon a company of about 20 Utahs  visited our camp. They came to trade with us and while doing  so one Indian struck another over the head with his gun and broke  it and the old chief whipped them both. In the afternoon  the one who had the gun broke over his head stole the others horse  and made off with him. The Indians followed and shot both  him and his horse dead and they returned to our camp an The  policy to be pursued with the Indians came up and President 
 Young and others expressed their views    First Meeting In the Bowery    Sunday August the 1st 1847    The congregation assembled under the Bowery on the Temple Block  at 10 o'clock and the meeting was opened by singing and prayer. Brother Kimball  first addressed the mecongregation and then was followed by a discourse from Orson  Pratt upon the prophices of Isaiah and their fulfilment in our present location and  the building up of Zion.    When Elder Pratt concluded Willard Richards read a   letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who went with it to the  Pacific and he spoke in the highest terms of praise of the members of the  Battalion in all their proceedings. A letter was also read from Capt Hunt; and  then Brother Kimball made some remarks upon our relations with the Indians.    In the afternoon the revelation given at Winter  Quarters was read by Elder Willard Richards and received a unanimous vote and   then the congregation was addressed by Elder Amasa Lyman. A vote  was taken to cease entirely trading with the Indians, and it was decided  to form all the encampments into one.    In the evening the Twelve met and decided  for brother E. T. Benson to go back with 3 others with him to meet  the camp get the mail and bring word concerning the Saints who were  following the Pioneers.    On the Monday Brother Benson started  and we commenced laying out the city beginning with the Temple Block  In forming the Temple Block 40 acres appeared so large that we held a council  to determine if it would or not be wisdom to reduce it to one half. G. A. Smith  believed if we did it we should be sorry and would rather enlarge than diminish  Heber C. Kimball thought we should let it be as it was even if we set it  out to shrubery Amasa Lyman said George A. Smith had spoken his mind  we all ran in the same channel and President Young said we could easier 
 diminish than enlarge it afterwards and it was determined that we let it remain as  it was.    Two days afterwards we again met upon the  subject and as it was considered that we could not do justice to 40 acres  to begin with we should limit the Temple and garden to 10 acres.    As we were under the necessity of returning  soon it was thought best to go into the mountains to draw logs to build  ourselves cabins as the "dobie" houses might not be ready for our use  Brothers Young and Kimball had commenced drawing out logs  for their buildings and brother George A. Smith and myself concluded  to join our efforts.    So on the morning of the 5th of August I  took my axe and in company with brother Smith went to the mountain  about six miles distance with several men with us to assist in chopping  We found a grove of fir trees that we thought would answer our purpose  but we had to make a road and bridges across the creek to it. I  dreaded the job for it was a hard one and I do not exercise the prudence  I ought when I take hold of hard labour. We chopped and drew  home to the Fort more than enough to build one house 16 feet square  and drew 25 logs home to the Fort. I was weary and my  hands blistered for I had done much the most work.    We started again next day with five teams  and 4 teams went also for Dr. Richards and in the two days  we had cut and drawn 77 logs for our two buildings.    That morning I had arisen quite sore with  the labour of the previous day and on going into the Valley  for my  horses could not find them and we supposed the Indians had driven  them off for they had been in Camp during the night so horsemen  were sent out to drive in all the horses in the Valley and much to  our joy we found none had been stolen this Increased our confidence  in the Indians around us.    I had ridden 8 miles without a saddle  and was fatigued by it but after we had found our horses I saddled 
 my horse and took my axe and went on before the teams and cut down 5 large fir  trees before they came up and during the two days I laboured so hard that when  we got home I could hardly stand upon my feet and I went into my waggon  and threw myself on my bed to rest.    I had not been there but a short time before  Heber C. Kimball called upon me and informed me that the Twelve were  going to the water to be rebaptized for the remission of sins to set example  to the whole Church and that the brethren would be called upon on Sunday  to follow the example.    The Twelve Re-baptized  August the 6th 1847    We considered this a duty and a privilege as we had come into  a glorious Valley to locate and build up Zion. We felt like renewing  our covenants before the Lord and each other and we soon repared to  the water and President Young went down into the water and  baptized all his brethren of the Twelve present and confirmed us and  sealed upon us our Apostleship and all the keys powers and blessings  belonging to that office. Brother Heber C. Kimball baptized  and confirmed President Brigham Young. The following were the  names and order of those present; Brigham Young Heber C.   Kimball Orson Pratt Willard Richards Wilford Woodruff  George A. Smith and Amasa Lyman    Selecting Their Inheritances    In the afternoon of the next day the Twelve went on to Temple Block  and picked out their inheritances. President Young took a block East  of the Temple and running South East to settle his friends around him;  Brother Heber C. Kimball took a block North of the Temple whereon to  settle his friends; Orson Pratt South of the Temple Block and running  South; Wilford Woodruff took a block cornering Temple Block and at 
 the South West corner joining Orson Pratts block; Amasa Lyman took a  block 40 rods below or West of Wilford Woodruff's and running S. West  to settle his friends and George A Smith took one joinging the Temple  on the West and running due West. It was supposed that Brother Richards  would take his on the East near President Young's None others of the Twelve  of the Twelve were present in camp.    During the same evening the Twelve went  to City Creek To City Creek and Heber C. Kimball baptized 55 members  of the camp for the remission of their sins and they were confirmed under  the hands of President Young Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A. Smith  and Amasa Lyman: Brigham Young being mouth.    General Baptism of the Pioneers  August the 8th 1847    Sunday Morning at six o'clock the Bishops repared  to the streams of water for the purpose of baptizing the whole camp  of Israel for the remission of sins and the renewal of their covenants  before the Lord.    Brothers Lewis Goddard Everett Shumway  Snow and Heber C. Kimball baptized and the Twelve confirmed them  There were two hundred and twenty four baptized and confirmed this morning  99 of whom I confirmed with my own hands. This made 288 in all  who had been re-baptized during the last three days.    The camp assembled as usual at 10 o'clock  for public meeting and was addressed by Heber C. Kimball who spoke  much to our edifycation. I followed and was never blessed with greater  liberty of speech.    In the afternoon we again met and partook  of the Sacrament. Brother Lorenzo Young addressed the people  and was followed by President Brigham Young who was febeble in health  Afterwards 110 men were called upon to go into the adobie yard and  76 volunteered. 
 I spent the Monday in making a sawpit on the next ^day^ in preparing  timber for our dwellings in the Fort. It had been decided to enclose one block of   10 acres with adobie sand log buildings as a Fort.    The North East corner was laid out as follows:  Brigham Young 4 rooms Lorenzo Young 2 Heber C. Kimball 5 rooms Willard  Richards 2 rooms Wilford Woodruff 2 ^George A. Smith 2 A. Lyman 2^ Erastus Snow 1: all the rooms were to be  14 feet wide and as long as we chosose. George A Smith and myself build  together.    Brother Crow had a [grand]child drowned on the 11th.    On the 13th the Twelve held council. Each one was to make  choice of the blocks that they were to settle their friends upon. Brother Brigham  took two tiers of blocks South through the city Brother Kimballs runs  North and N. W. Orson Pratt 4 blocks Wilford Woodruff 8 blocks George  A. Smith 8 and Amasa Lyman 12 blocks according to the companies  organized with them.    Next day 4 of the Messengers returned from  Bear River and Cache Valleys. They had gone with Capt. Brown who  had started with a company to San Francisco Bay via Fort Hall.    The returned messengers brought a cheering  report of Cache Valley and the country between us and there. The soil  was rich well watered and well calculated for farming purposes and  Bear River ^Valley^ for grazing &c.    The brethren also returned that went to Utah  Lake to get fish and they found a mountain of granite good for building  running from 7 to 15 miles from camp. The Quorum of the  Twelve decided in council that the name of our city should be the "City of   the Salt Lake".    Remarks by President Young  Sunday August 15th    "I am going to day to speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal  Priesthood and by request of brother Crow say something upon the death of 
 his [grand]child by drowning the other day. I hope to speak so as to be understood.    There is a reality in eternal things as much as in  the things of time which we daily see with our eyes. When a man has  a dream or vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as though  he saw it with his own eyes in one sense of the word.    The Lord has hid from man the things that  he knew before he came into the flesh that he might walk by faith  and prove himself while here. The Lord converses with man on the earth  in the form of a servant and by visions and dreams &c but he never appeared  to man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory for He is as a consuming  fire and a mortal body would paerish in an instant in His presence.    The Priesthood is again restored to the earth  to bring that which was lost. We do not receive all at once but we  receive grace for grace. When brother Joseph received the Priesthood  he did not receive all at once. He was a Prophet Seer and Revelator  before he had the fulness of the Priesthood and keys of the Kingdom. He  first received the Aaronic Priesthood and keys from under the hands  of John the Baptist. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm  the Church but afterwards he received the Patriarchal or Melchisidick Priesthood  from under the hands of Peter James and John who were of the Twelve  Apostles and were the Presidency when the other Apostles were absent. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##]    From those Apostles Joseph Smith received  every power blessing and privilege of the highest authority of the Melchisidick  Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth.    Some have had fears that we had not power  to get revelations since the death of Joseph. But I want this subject from this  time and forever to be set at rest; and I want the Church to understand from  this day henceforth and forever that an Apostle is the highest office and  authority that there is in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth.    From whom did Joseph receive his authority?  From just such men as set around me here -[pointing to the Twelve Apostles  who sat with him]- Peter James and John were Apostles and there   was no noise about their being Seers and Revelators though those 
 gifts were among them. Joseph Smith gave unto me and my brethren the Twelve  all the Priesthood Keys power and authority which he held and those are powers which   belong to the Apostleship.    In Joseph's day we had to ordain Patriarchs. Could  we ordain men to authority greater than we held ourselves? No. But it is necessary  to have Patriarchs to bless the people that they may have blessings by the Spirit of  prophecy and revelation sealed upon their heads and their posterity and to know what awaits  their posterity.    Father Smith was the senior Patriarch in the  Church and first Patriarch in our day and afterwards Hyrum was the senior  Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head. But wasere thereir power and authority  different from that of all Patriarchs in the Church? No. There were all alike in their  authority in blessing.    Elijah is spoken of in the Bible that he should come  in the last days to turn the Hearts of the fathers to the children and the children  to their fathers. [##Malachi 4:5-6##] The fulfilment of this Scripture is manifest in establishing  the Kingdom of God and Priesthood on the earth in the last days and those who  hold the keys of the Priesthood and sealing power have the Spirit and Power of  Elijah and it is necessary in order to redeem our dead and save our children.    There is much more importance attached to this  than parents are aware of.    In the loss of this [grand]child of Brother Crow that was  drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feelings; for  I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. It is true all  children are saved. Their names are written in the Lamb's book of life  which was the case with every Spirit that takes a tabernacle on this earth  Their names were written there before the world was made and will there  ever remain until they sin against the Holy Ghost. It will then be  blotted out no more to be reatcorded for ever.    But notwithstanding this can Brother Crow get  that child again or any other persons their children except there is something done  for them on the earth by their parents? No they would not. They they  would go to God who gave them but the parents ^on earth^ would not have them 
 The parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the Spirit and what is the  body good for without the spirit? What then can be done? I will tell you  A man that has embraced the Gospel must go to some one who has the Priesthood  and keys and power of Elijah and must attend to ordinances for that child even  must be baptized for it as well as to have it sealed to him and through this medium  claim his child in the morning of the resurrection and the Lord will give it up  to him.    I had my children sealed to me in the Temple  except one that died and that I shall leave in the hands of the Lord until I have  another opportunity.    As soon as we get up some adobie houses for our families we shall go to work to build another Temple and as soon as a place is  prepared we shall commence the endowments long before the Temple is built  and we shall take time and each step the Saints take let them take  time enough about it to understand it.    Everything at Nauvoo went with a rush  We had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the  other and mobs were upon us all the while and many crying out, "O the  Temple cant be built!" I told them it should be built. This Church  should not fall and the Lord said if we did not build it we should be  rejected as a Church with our dead. Why did He say it? Because  the Saints were becoming slothful and covetous and would spend their money  upon fine houses for themselves before they would put it into a house for  the Lord.  But we went at it and finished it and turned it over  into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth and hell and the brethren was   so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give them their endowment.    The children want to be sealed to their parents and  parents to their children that they may have blessings in eternity which they  will stand in  need of.    God promised to Abraham that his seed should be  as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea shore and to  his seed there should be no end. [##Genesis 22:17##] This of course would continue to all  eternity the same blessings upon our heads if we are faithful for 
 our eyes have not seen nor our ears heard neither entered into our hearts the great things that  God has in store for us.    And when I look upon the great work the Elders of Israel   have to perform and look around upon them and see them vain and foolish, it makes  me sorrowful. They forget their calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a   moment what manner of persons ought ye to be? men who hold the Priesthood and   keys of salvation and have power to go to the nations of the earth and say to the people  I have salvation for you and power to exalt you to celestial glory or if you reject  it to seal you unto damnation.    It is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand  to deal with the eternal destinies of the sons and daughters of Adam who form  the nations of the earth.    While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted to cut off the  Gentiles who rejected the Gospel and killed the Prophets and it was recorded on earth  and it is recorded in Heaven. That nation will go down quickly!"    Many other interesting and important items were presented  by President Young.    In the afternoon Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow preached  and in the evening President Young met with the company who were to start back  in the morning with the ox teams: there were over 60 in number. Many of  the Battalion deposited with him their guns for safe keeping    On the evening of the 20th while unloading the last  load of logs for our houses one stick fell on Bro George A Smiths head knocked  him down cut a hole in his head and hurt him badly    In Conference with the Twelve and Saints on Sunday  the 22nd it was resolved by the public Assembly to call this place, "The  City of the Great Salt Lake" of the Great Bason North America; the  stream running through the city, City Creek; the Utah outlet Western  Jordan and two creeks coming out of the mountain Great Kanyon Creek  and Little Kanyon Creek and one large stream Mill Creek. It was  also voted to fence the city for farming purposes the coming year and  to appoint a President and High Council and all other necessary officers  in this Stake of Zion and that the Twelve write an epistle to leave 
 with the Saints in the City of the Great Salt Lake. Adjourned until the  6th of October A. D. 1848.    The Pioneer Camp Returning  to  Winter Quarters  August the 26, 1847    The morning the Pioneer Camp with a large number of the Battalion  harnessed up our horses and bade farewell to our friends who were to tarry  I put a pair of mules on my carriage and brother Stillman drove them and   I rode on horse back.    On the 4th day of our journey we were met  by our massengers E. T. Benson and companions who had been on to  meet the camp of Saints bound for the Valley of the Great Salt Lake  They were truly welcome messengers for our anxiety to hear from our  families had been great. The coming Camp numbered nearly  600 waggons and were divided into 9 companies. I received three  letters from Mrs. Woodruff and one from A. O. Smoot. My father  was coming along but Mother Woodruff had gone back to Iowa to  live with my sister Eunice and her husband.    We reached Fort Bridger on the 31st and on  the 3rd of September upon the Big Sandy to our great joy we met  the first Fifty of the 6 hundred waggons: they belong to brother  Spencer's Hundred. A meeting of the Camp was held in the  evening and addressed by George A. Smith Brigham Young Heber C.  Kimball and Wilford Woodruff.    On the 4th we travelled to Little Sandy and   to mar met Captain Session's Fifty and also Parley P. Pratt's Fifty.    In the afternoon the quorum of the Twelve  convened together and we had one of the most interesting councils we ever heed [had]  together. At the commencement two of the quorum was  sharply reproved for undoing what the majority of the quorum had done 
 in the organization of the camps for travelling. At first it was not received but afterwards  the error was seen and confessed. Much teaching was given by President Young  and the power of God rested upon us and our hearts were melted.    The President said if he did not tell us of our faults  we should be destroyed but if he told us of them and reproved us we should live in  love in love and our hearts be cemented together.    Brothers Parley Pratt and John Taylor had been to England  and done a good work but had returned to Winter Quarters and disorganized  the two divisions and companies that the quorum of the Twelve had spent the  whole Winter in organizing and which was also governed by revelation. Brother  Parley took the lead; and President Young chastized him for his course and  taught us principle. He said that when we set apart one or more of the  Twelve to go and do a certain piece of work they would be blessed in doing  that and the quorum would back up what they did, but when one or more  of the quorum interfere with the work of the majority they burn their fingers  and do wrong. When the majority of the Twelve plant a Stake of   Zion and establish a President over the Stake and appoint a High Council  has the minority of the Twelve one or more any right to go and interfere  with those councils? No; unless they should get corrupt and do wrong.  Then it would be the duty of any one of the Twelve to show them their error  and teach them what was right: and should the majority of those Councils  get corrupt and try to lead astray the people it would then be the duty  of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils and call upon the  people to sustain him and appoint a new one; but while the councils  are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be  with them to assist in carrying out the views that the majority of the  Twelve had established.    The quorum all decided that Brother Parley Pratt  had committed an error in not carrying out the emigration ^organization^ as established by  the Twelve.    Brother Parley was led to confess his fault and the power  of God rested upon the whole quorum and President Young and that  he felt eternity upon him and was weighed down with to the earth with 
 this work and that brother Kimball felt the weight of it more than any other man  except himself. He should chastise any one of the quorum when out of the  way. He had done it for their good and was constrained to do it by the   power of God.    Brother Heber C. Kimball addressed brother Young and   wished him to rest as much as possible and let his brethren to bear his  burdens. He said he wanted brother Brigham to save himself for he   was wearing down. "I feel tender toward you and want you to live  and if I or my brethren do wrong tell us of it and we will repent."    Brother Brigham observed that there was not a better  lot of men on earth than the Twelve but when they needed it he should  chastise them that they might be saved.    Each of the quorum present expressed his feelings  and we all felt it good to be there for the Lord was with us.    Next day we travelled to the Springs and here met   three Fifties. Here I found in brother Smoots company my father  and many from our Ward.    After supper we held a meeting of all the  camps when George A Smith Wilford Woodruff and Orson Pratt  addressed them. It was decided by vote to tarry over the morrow.    The Twelve held council on the day of our tarry  and settled some important matters and in the evening at Dr. Richard's  we heard read the Epistle to the Saints in the Great Salt Lake  Valley.    On the 7th we bade farewell to the Valley bound  companies and continued our journey towards Winter Quarters.    We travelled 14 miles and camped on the  Sweet Water with John Taylor's company and also Edward Hunter's  The ground was covered with snow which continued to fall till evening.    The Hundred prepared a feast for the whole  Pioneer Camp and furnished a table here in the wilderness in  fine style. Our feast consisted of roast and broiled beef 
 pies cakes biscuit butter Peach sauce coffee tea sugar and a great variety of good  things. In the evening the Camp had a dance but the Twelve met in council  at brother Shirtliff's tent and transacted the business that came before them  for adjustment.    Fourteen miles were travelled farther on the morrow and  then we met brother J. M Grant's Hundred.    Brother Grant had burried a child on the road and  his wife lay at the point of death.    In the evening we held a council and heard from   Brother Jedediah the circumstances of the organization of the companies  and Brother Brigham said he was more than ever convinced that there was  wrong in this matter. Brother Grant also related his interview with  Col T Cane who had the Spirit of the Lord with him and was working  for us but Thomas Benton was our inveterate enemy and was doing   all he could against us.    Our Horses Stolen By The Indians    The alarm was given early next morning that a lot of  our horses and mules were stolen. Bells were found cut from the  horses the lariettes cut an arrow picked up and other Indian signs. The  trail was finally found and a company of 20 horsemen started after  the Indians.    It looked gloomy to see so many women and children  here in the mountains with their horses and cattle stolen and breaking  down so late in the season. Thirty horses were taken from the  Pioneer Camp and 20 from the other camps which was quite crippling  to us.    The camps remained together during the day  and in the evening assembled for meeting and was addressed by  Orson Pratt Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young.    During the evening 2 of our brethren returned who  had been in pursuit and brought back five of the horses. 
 Next morning we parted with our friends who were  going Hest ^West^ and those of us who had not lost horses divided with those who  had. As we journied on we met the remainder of our brethren returning  from pursuing the horses but they did not obtain any more of them. The  enemy had escaped with 43 of our horses.    Our Camp Attacked By 200 Indian Warriors    September the 21st 1847    Two weeks later than the time when the Indians stole so many  horses from us we had another immensely exciting Indian fray.    About 9 o'clock in the morning the call was made  to get our horses. I started for them in the timber half mile from  Camp. When I got about two thirds of the way to the horses  one of the most exciting scenes occurred I ever witnessed.    I hear several reports ^of  guns^ in quick succession  and our Guard cry "Indians! Indians!"    In less than a minute the timbered ^and^ bluffs were  lined with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard horses  and camp. They shot at two or three of the guard but missed them  One of our guard they ^two of them^ took and tried to carry him off on his horse. He  knocked some of them down with his fist and got away. Some  of the brethren snaped their guns but they missed fire.    As soon as I heard the report of guns and  the cry of Indians and saw them driving off our horses and gathering thick   and fast upon every hand being without either horse or arms I ran  to camp with all speed and gave the alarm and called upon all to  gather their arms and mount their horses.    Brothers Kimball Rockwood Mathews  and several others sprang on to their horses with their guns and pistols  and ran to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away.    One party of Indians had driven five or ^about^ 
 six ^a dozen^ horses and mules over the hills. Brother Kimball took after them. Two   Indians had gone over the Bluff with my horse and mule: Brother Rockwood took  after them and at the same time about 20 of our horses came rushing towards  camp frightened by the Indians. With great exertion President Young and  one or two other brethren succeeded in stoping them and getting them into  our camp.    As soon as I arrived in camp I opened my trunk  took out my belt containing 8 pistols ^shots^ and harnessed ^buckled^ it on to myself as quick  as possible put a saddle and bridle on to a broken down horse for want of  a better one and mounted without spupr or whip and gave chase after my  own horses. I could not ride very fast over the rough ground and bluffs  on a poor horse but I went as fast as I could.    As soon as I began to rise the bluffs I saw  Indians gathering thick on every hand closing in between me and the camp  As I passed one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the  chase.    While putting up a ravine with steep bluffs on  each side an avalanche of some 30 Indians rushed down upon me and  hedged me in so that I could not get out. Within a few feet of me  a large Indian drew a gun upon me. I presented a six shooter  at his breast and gave a yell which I had no sooner done than he  gave a whoop and ran up the hill and left me and all the other Indians  surrounding me followed his example and ran.    As soon as my horse and mule had got over their  fright and got out of sight of camp they tried to return to it and troubled  the Indians in driving them and brother Rockwood soon came near  them and one stoped and met him when they found they were overtaken  and professed friendship but the other still tried to drive off the horses  and brother Rockwood fired a pistol at him and he ran and the other  Indian did the same and brother Rockwood started my horses towards  me and I soon came to his assistance also some other brethren and  we catched them.    While this was going on nearly 40 Indians 
 surrounded brother Kimball and some of the brethren started to his assistance.    Indians were also upon every side ^of me^ until 2 got to  the camp and the brethren who had helped me had gone to the aid of  brother Kimball.    By this time 150 warriors had gathered close to  our camp all dressed in the greatest still for a war charge; and the   old chief began to address at the top of his voice the Indian band and  also our camp telling us that they were good Sionx and they had thought  we were Crows or Snakes.    When they found they could not get any more  of our horses and that three had been re-taken which they had stolen  they professed friendship. There were 11 horses in all taken by  the Indians who numbered about 200 warriors on the ground who  were well mounted and there were not more than 20 meof our men  including our guard who were engaged in any way against them  in stoping them or retaking our horses.    Brother Gould took one Indian horse  and all and another Indian brought back Thomas Woolsey's horse  which was among the stolen and exchanged him for the Indian  horse. This with my two horses were the only ones  retaken during the skirmish.    But when the Indian Warriors gathered  before our camp they saw that we as a body were armed and that we   knew them and had treated them kindly on our way to the Valley.    The old chief then proposed that we smoke  the pipe of peace and said that if our chief pointing to President Young  would go to their camp they would smoke with him and give up  the horses which his men had taken. Brother Brigham was not  well and we did not think it prudent for him to go.    While in this conversation with the Indians  Brother Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses returned  bare headed (having droped his hat) accompanied by brother Benson  and in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the. 
 Indians and they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them  in the rear instantly leaped upon their horses scattered and dashed from the camp  some running into the creek and all appeared in great fright; but as soon as they  saw that no harm was designed they returned and took their places and had a  hearty laugh at their fright.    Brother Kimball volunteered to accompany the  chief into his camp in the place of President Young that we might get our horses  I volunteered and also Stephen Markham volunteered to go with Brother Kimball  on the expedition and so we three mounted our horses and set out accompanied by  a Frenchman who could speak a little Sioux language.    The Indians told us their camp was one mile  away but we travelled 7 miles over Bluffs and Valleys before we came   in sight of their camp some three miles distant moving towards us.    So we halted and waited for them and they  came and pitched about 100 lodges. Their were some 600 Indians men  woman and children and they brought with them about 1000 horses and mules  all of which we supposed were stolen from emigrants and other tribes. Their  encampment presented a very picturesque and amusing appearance.    Among their horses we readily descovered ours  which were stolen on the night we camped with brother Grant's company  We lost 49 that night and they were here in the drove which these  Indians had.    The old chief called ^together^ the war chiefs and placed  them on his left hand and ourselves on his right and set down upon the  grass and filled a long pipe with Keunickennisick and smoke and passed   it to his chiefs; they smoked and passed it to us and we also smoked  in turn.    The old Chief then pointed to us to pick out our  horses which we undertook to do but we found it no easy task to pick  out 8 or 9 horses scattered through one thousand others for one or two  miles up the creek.  However after a labor^i^ous search we got all  but two that were stolen this morning. We then spoke to him  about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before and 
 they acknowledged they had the horses butand gave us some ancouragent ^encouragement^ of letting us  have them when we got to Laramie but would not let us have them then  excepting only one. The brethren brought 3 bushels of salt as a present  to the chief. We returned to camp and this ended the scenes and business of the day.    We reached Laramie on the 24th and  Brothers Young, Kimball, Benson and myself dined with Mr. Burdow  and talked to him about our stolen horses. He informed us  that our company with the ox teams lost every horse they had but they  got them back excepting five. He gave us some encouragement of  sending an Interpreter with us.    We crossed the Platte and pitched our  camp about 3 miles from the Fort and President Young called us together  and addressed us at some length and appointed 10 men to go and  visit the Indians to get our stolen horses and 25 men to follow after  to assist in case of necessity.    Next morning at 9 o'clock the first  company of 10 men commanded by Col. Markham started on their  Indian expedition and an hour afterwards the 2 of 25 men followed  han^under^ the command of Brother Benson but it was not long before  both companies returned having ascertained that a man had gone forward  to inform the Indians of our coming and to have them ckache  up their horses.    In the evening we received word that Brothers  Johnson and Little had returned on the road to us and had fallen  in the with Commodore Stockton from the Bay of San Francisco with  40 men going to the S[t]ates.    Next morning, Sunday, Brothers Johnson  and Little reached the Fort with two other brethren bringing us ten  horses for which we were indeed glad for we had as much as we  could do to get along and our horses were daily growing poor. Brothers  Young, Kimball and others dined at the Fort with Commodore Stockton.    In the afternoon we drove three miles 
 on our journey and camped.    We were now nearly out of bread and meat and this  was the case for some days to come but we killed a little and obtained some  meat from Mr. Benshaw the ^an^ Indian Trader and he promised to come over the  river with some Indians and kill some buffalo for us but we missed each  other and we did not have our buffalo hunt on the 1st of October for which  we had prepared. On this evening Com^m^odore Stockton arrived and said he  would like to journey with us but he changed his mind next morning and   concluded to travel on the North Side of the Platte.    We bought some half dozen horses of the Indian  trader.    Wonderful Discipline of a Buffalo Herd    In company of Luke Johnson I left camp on the 3rd  to get some meat. We started at daybreak and the wolves which had  rent the air during the night were dispersing in all directions as we rode  along and the beautiful swan in flocks were floating upon the Platte  adding beauty to the scene.    Soon a large herd of buffalo was in sight  and we left our horses and stole upon them the best we could and their  picket guards were frightened several times but we managed to re-assure  them. There is no well-diciplined army of men more particular  to have an old experienced guard on a close look out than a herd  of Buffalo.    By going under a bank we passed their guards  and lay ^lyn^ ^lying^ concealed until we were surrounded and the main bodies  were comming on to us with a heavy phalansx of bulls meeting us  in the face with the cows fallowing in their rear.    When they were within a few rods of us we  thought it time to be up and doing for our own safety. I had a single  load in my rifle and a brace of pistols and Johnson a slide of six loads  in his rifle. He fired twice and they broke and ran. None were 
 killed. I then put a ball into a young cow. She hobbled off and I walked  over the ridge and shot her through the heart strings and lungs & She  droped dead. Johnson mounted and rode some distance after the herd but my  cow was the only one we got. We travelled a erfew miles farther and brother  Amasa Lyman killed two more and an antelope. The meat was brought  into camp and divided. ^dev^    On the morning of the 5th a company of 10  men were dispatched on foot to overtake the ox teams and stop them until  we should come up as our horses were breaking down. We learned from  a board stuck up on the way that they had tarried five days for us  and killed and dried 30 buffalo cows and they were still about one  week ahead of us.    On the 8th while we nooned we thought we   saw approaching in the distance a band of mounted warriors but  by the aid of our spy glasses we found them to be    A Band of Elk.    They made a splendid appearence. I went up a swail of tall grass  and the band came within 10 rods of me their horns waving above the  tall weeds like rocking chairs. I drew my gun for a doe; but  at this instant another man came up behind me and they saw him  and broke and ran. He shot after them but to no effect. They  ran near a Frenchman and he shot a doe and I got a piece of her  for supper. This was the first Elk I ever eate.    On the 16th just before camping the   brethren returned whom we sent after the ox teams. They could not  gain upon them and all except two gave it up. Brother Luke Johnson  came near being trampled to pieces by a large herd of Buffalo travelling  in the night. They came upon him suddenly and he was  caught in their midst and they were 15 minutes passing him  The only way he had to keep them from trampling him down was  by striking out on each side with his stick punching them and yelling. 
 As they passed him they opened a lane in the herd just wide enough for him to  stand and he thus escaped being trampled to death.    Hunting Expedition    Oct. 17th    We were now passt the buffalo ground and as our camp had  not enough meat it was deaemed wise for a company of Hunters to return back  So about 20 of us including butchers and teamsters returned 10 miles with three  waggons and pitched our camp in a little timber on a slough and during the  evening we killed two buffalo.    After cutting the body of meat from the bones we roasted  them for our supper and breakfast and at the two meals we ate ^picked^ the bones of  of the two buffaloes. It is incredible what an amount of buffalo meat  a hungry man will eat without salt or bread and not make him sick. The  hump bones of a fat buffalo rosasted is most delicious and the leg bones  are filled with marrow which we drank without bread. As we sat around  our fireside we should have been ^made^ a delightful picture for an artist  to have drawn.    At daylight in the morning 4 of us went to the  Bluffs to observed the position of the herds. After breakfast we divided  into twos. Luke Johnson went with me and we saw while out  three wild horses and they were splendid looking creatures.    We found that the herds on the upland  were travelling to the N. & N. E. and the only way to obtain meat was  for the hunters to confine themselves to the herds on the flat. Nine  buffalo were killed ^most of them by Amasa Lyman^ but only seven of them were dressed and brought  into camp: the wolves feasted on the other two. We got counsel to  return to the main body early in the morning.    Met By the Police From Winter Quarters  October the 19th    In accordance to our instructions we started early in the morning  to return to the main camp and when about a mile on our way 
 we discovered 7 men about 2 miles from us coming from some scattered timber  We at first took them to be Indians on foot but we soon found them to be mounted  white men and we then thought they were troops. They came down upon  us with all speed and we stood ready with our arms in hand to meet  them; but when they came to our great surprise we found them to be  the police from Winter Quarters led by Brother Hosea Stout. They   informed us that 16 of them had come from Winter Quarters thinking  we might need some help. The remainder of the party had stoped with  our main camp.    We halted our teams returned with them to  our camping ground and prepared the brethren breakfast from our fat  Buffalo and they regaled us with information of our wives and families  We reached the Camp at 8 o'clock in the evening and had a pleasant  interview with the rest of our brethren from Winter Quarters    [Circled Text] insert   day before [End Circled Text]    Winter Quarters Reached    Sunday October 31st 1847    We all got over breakfast and organized for going into Winter Quarters  The company that came out to meet us went in front of our encampment  It was a hard day's drive as our horses were worn down and 30  miles were before us.    When within about one mile of Winter  Quarters a halt was made and the company was drawn up in  order and addressed by President Young ^who dismissed the Pioneer camp with his blessing^ and then we drove into  the city in order. The streets waere lined with people to  shake hands with us as we passed along. Each drove to his  own home. Three days previous to my arrival I had  a daughter born to me and I found both mother and child doing   well and all cheerful and happy. &c &c &c 
 Winter Quarter's Prosperous    On our arrival at Winter Quarters we found that the brethren there had  as well as ourselves also been greatly blessed and the earth under their cultivation  had brought forth in great abundance. The city was full of hay surrounded  with corn and plenty of vegeatables and buckwheat had grown.    The 3rd of November was spent by the Twelve in  council and brother Jesse C. Little was to be sent East and I wrote 6 letters  to Col. Kane and others to be taken by him. We also heard a letter  read from Capt. Dan Jones of Wales who could represent in that land  one thousand Saints.    During the month of November much important  business and matter came before the Twelve and on the last of the  month the subject came up concerning appointing three of the Quorum of   the Twelve as the First Presidency. Brother Brigham Young said  that by pursuing this course it would liberate the quorum of the Twelve  to go to the nations of the earth.    On the 3rd of December we met in conference  with the Saints on the East side of the river. Elder Appleby arrived  in our midst from Philadelphia spent the evening with us and gave  us much information concerning the nation the wars &c. He brought  as a present from Col. Kane a card of gold pens one for each of the  Twelve.    The conference next day was adjourned for three  weeks after having resolved to immediately build a large log tabernacle  for the people to meet in. Henry Miller was appointed the   committee and about 200 gave their names to go at once to work  It was to be about 65 by 40 feet in the cleer and the building was  to be under the direction of the Twelve.    Next day was an important one in the history  of the Church. We rode to Elder Hyde's had a good feast and  went into council and determined the following important matter: 
 Brigham Young Appointed President  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Sunday Dec. 5th 1847.    Brother Brigham Young In This Council of the Quorum of the  Twelve Appostles of the Church brother Brigham Young its President  expressed his mind concerning the organization of the Church and the  appointing of a First Presidency. He wished all of the quorum  present to express their feelings and views upon the subject beginning  with the oldest and we did in the following order:    Heber C. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson Pratt  Willard Richards Wilford Woodruff George A Smith A Lyman  and E. T. Benson; and then President Young followed.    After this Orson Hyde moved that Brigham  Young be President of the Church of Jesus Crist of Latter-day Saints  and that he nominate his two councillors to form the First  Presidency. Wilford Woodruff seconded it and the motion was  carried by the unanimous vote of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles    President Young then nominated Heber  C. Kimball as his First Councillor which was seconded by  and carried unanimously. President Young then nominated  Willard Richards as his Second Councillor which was seconded by  and carried unanimously.    Father John Smith  Appointed First Patriarch  of the Church  Dec. 6th 1847    The day after choosing the First Presidency the Twelve commenced 
 in council and Father John Smith was appointed by them the First Patriarch  over the whole Church.    Remarks upon several subjects were made by President  Young among which were the following items:    Our children in this life do not look just like their parents but  they have a variety of looks. The offspring of celestial beings have spiritual  bodies.    He also said that the Twelve were at liberty to publish  papers in any part of the world where they should be or to take the best  course to spread the work. The Twelve should superintend the printing  wherever they where and if they were going abroad it will be well for  them to ordain Elders out of new members and take them to preach  and there should only one of the Apostles go to one place and call the  Seventies to their assistance.    In this same council it was decided that if a man  lost his wife he was at liberty to mary again where he pleased and  was justified; and Wm W. Phelps was cut off from the Church for  adultery.    Log Tabernacle Conference  held at   Winter Quarters  Dec. the 24th, 1847.    The brethren on the East side of the river had been busily building their  Log Tabernacle designed for this Conference and others which might follow  he felt they had done a good work in so short a time and on the  day appointed we held this one of the most important conferences of  the Church.    The Conference opened at 10 o'clock this day  according to appointment. Orson Pratt opened by prayer and Wilford  Woodruff addressed the meeting upon the object of calling the  Conference and was followed by Orson Pratt upon the same subject.  Others also addressed the assembly during the day. 
 The Conference lasted 4 days. On the evening of the  second day the Twelve met in Council and spoke of appointing the First Presidency  during this Conference and several men were named to fill up the quorum  of the Twelve but it was not decided who should fill up that quorum.    The First Presidency Chosen By the Church  In General Conference at Winter Quarters  Dec. the 27, 1847.    On the last and most important day of the Conference about 1000  souls were assembled in the Log Tabernacle.    Heber C. Kimball addressed the meeting in  the morning in the power of God and then the names of the Seventy  were called over and President Young remarked that it would not be  necessary to put them to the meeting or to organized them into quorums  while here but to remain in a body under their Presidents until they   arrived at the Valley.    He said that any quorum of the Seventies  or the Twelve though scattered to the four corners of the earth and not  filled up in Zion yet as quorums would be full but when there was  a vacancy by death or apostacy then the vacancy might be filled.    From President Youngs teachings we learned  that it was necessary to keep up a full organization of the Church through  all time as far as could be: at least the First Presidency Quorum of  the Twelve Seventies and Patriarch over the whole Church.    It was then moved by  and seconded by and carried unanimously by the  body of the Church in Conference at Winter Quarters that Brigham Young  be the President of the whole Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints.    President Young then nominated Heber C.  Kimball to be his First Councillor which was seconded by  and carried unanimously. 
 President Young afterwards nominated Willard Richards as his  Second Councillor which was seconded by and  carried by a unanimous vote.    It was then moved by and  seconded by that President John Smith be the Patriarch  over the whole Church.    Much important and interesting instruction was given  upon these and other subjects among which President Young spoke upon the  resurrection. He said there was nothing more to be learned by the people  upon the subject than what was written. It was made plain in  the Bible and other revelations and it was not a subject we wanted to  use at the present time as we had not come to the resurrection. There  was no person except a resurrected being who held the keys of the resurrection  Michael the Arch-angel or Ancient of Days who was Father Adam holds  the keys of the Resurrection.    The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock on  the 6th day of April 1848.    On the last day of the year I had an interview  with President Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects among  which was that of my going East on a mission.    Sypnosis of 1847    The Twelve Apostles with their brethren 143 volunteers as  Pioneers had made a journey of more than one thousand miles to the Rocky  Mountains and sought out a place for a city and a stake of Zion  that the Saints might have a place to flee to while the indignation  of the Law pass over the nation that had driven them out. We  had returned to Winter Quarters and with all our exposures sickness  and danger not a human life had been lost but all returned in  safety. The blessing of the Lord had been great upon 
 us as a people during this year in all the various portions of the Camp  of Israel and throughout the whole earth. While the past year  had also shown the fulfilment of prophecy in wars rumours of wars  and the many gathering signs of the times. The United States had  been engaged in war with Mexico involving themselves in a debt  of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars and a loss of twenty five  thousand men on their side and double that on the Mexican side  famine had raged in Ireland cholera through Europe and a new  era opened in the history of the Jews by the election of Baron  Rothschild to the British Parliament and a prevailing spirit for  the gathering home to Jerusalem.    During this year I traveled 2619 miles mostly  in our Pioneer journey to and from the Great Bason or Great Salt  Lake City.    I attended with the Twelve 56 Councils.    With the High Council 15.    I preached 33 times to the Saints blessed 12 children  administered to 30 sick persons wrote 14 letters and received 6.    Baptisms Confirmations & Ordinations    I baptized 3; confirmed 122; ordained 1 Bishop  and one number of the Seventies. 
 During the first three months of the year 1848  the affairs of the Church and temporal arrangements of the people  at Winter Quarters were filled in with about the usual amount of  ordinary business and events with here and there an incident worthy  of historical note but not sufficient to afford a constant thread of  narative as did our Pioneer Journey.    From January the 16 to the end of  the 20, meetings were held by the Twelve at the Log Tabernacle  on the East side of the river. We crossed on the ice to visit  the Saints.    Two petitions were presented to the meetings  for signatures one for a county in Potawattame tract of land  in Iowa and the other for a Past Office. Brother Miller and others  were appointed to go to the Legislature of the State of Iowa  as delegates to lay before it the pettition of the people of  Winter Quarters for a county. 
 In Council on the 25th Almon Babbit Hyrum  Kimball and John Snider from Nauvoo made a report of affairs  in that City and received some counsel from President Young  who said he did not wish the Temple there Nauvoo to be sold  and a number of other matters came up.    On the 3rd of Feb. those who were in the  battle of Nauvoo held a feast to commemorate the event. President  Young ^Kimball^ addressed the company upon the subject of the battle  and was followed by Col Johnson after which there were feasting  singing instrumental music and dancing.    In the battle it appeared from what was  stated there were only 100 Mormons against 900 to a 1000  of the mob. There were only three of the brethren killed  and one or two slightly wounded while there were several waggon  loads of the mob killed and many wounded and the enemy driven  from the field. The brethren wore a red badge on the  left arm to distinguishe them from their enemies enemies.  They wore the same red badge to day at the feast.    Orson Hyde returned from the East in  the middle of the month. We also heard of the welfare  and success of the mission of Cap. Dan Jones in Wales in spite  of the fact that nearly the whole of that country was stirred up  against him.    I was 41 years of age on the 1st  March.    On the night of the 5th I had  An Interesting Dream.    It was one of the most interesting I ever dreamt but most of  it was taken from me when I awoke.    I flew through the air from state to  state and escaped from the hand of my enemies. I went to 
 Heaven and saw the Saints in their estate and employment. I saw Joseph and  Hyrum Smith and many others of the Latter-day Saints who have died.  The innumberable company of Saints which I saw seemed to be preparing  for some grand and important event which I could not understand. Many  were engaged in making crowns for the Saints. One crown did not  suit the artist so he cut it in the middle to remake it. The Saints  were all dressed in white robes both male and female.    On the 18th ^22nd^ of March my son Wilford Woodruff  was eight years of age and he wished to be baptized: so according to the  order of the Church to baptize children at that age I in company with  his mother and sisters and brother John Benbow went to the water and    Baptized My Son Wilford Woodruff Jun.  March the 18th ^22nd^ 1848    We returned home and he was Confirmed By myself and  John Benbow.    On the 21st a large mail was received from the  East. I had a letter from Orson Spencer giving account of the Church  in Europe over which he Presided. The papers brought the state  of affairs of the United States. Among the members of Company  dead was John Quincy Adams aged 81 years. He died in his seat  in the house of Congress. His father John Adams and  Thomas Jefferson both Presidents of the United States both died on  the same day the 4th of July in the fiftieth year of the Independence  of the United States and now John Quincy Adams had died on  the birth day of Washington.    On the 27th Brigham Young H. C. Kimball  Wilford Woodruff and others crossed the river and met at the Log  Tabernacle ^with^ Orson Hyde George A. Smith and a number besides  and we went into Council concerning the the organization of  the Pottawattame County. Documents were read from  several members of Iowa to the inhabitants of this County and 
 concerning politics and other matters. Speeches were made pro and  con. and finally answers were given to the effect that we felt  disposed to let politics take their own course and find their own  level.    On the following Sunday our city was  visited with a strong gale of wind and a hay stack was burned  down on the outskirts of the place and had it been in the city  the wind probably would have blown the fire and endangered  the whole city.    Next day we were in Council with  several of the Pawnee chiefs who asked for about ^a^ hundred bushels  of corn for their families who were starving. There were about  one hundred of the Pawnees in the City and we loaded their  mules with corn and let them go home.    Nex On the 4th of April I baptized  a number among whom was Samuel H. Smith only son  of Samuel H Smith brother of Joseph the Prophet.    News reached us of the French  revolution and the abdication of King Louis Philippe.    General Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  held at the Log Tabernacle Potawattame County  April 6th 1848.    The conference organized at 11 o'clock and Orson Hyde was  appointed President. There was then an intermission of one  hour.    The Conference re-assembled and Orson  Hyde addressed the meeting. He remarked that a First  Presidency had been appointed but he wished it sustained by this 
 General Annual Conference of the Church.    Orson Hyde then moved that Brigham Young be  the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which was  carried unanimously. Heber C. Kimball was next by a unanimous  vote chosen to be his First Councillor and afterwards Willard Richards  his Second Councillor.    The General Conference next sustained as members  of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt  ^O Pratt^ Wilford Woodruff John Taylor George A Smith Amasa Lyman Lyman  Wight and Ezra T. Benson.    Next Joseph Young Levi Hancock Henry Herriman  Zerah Pulsipher A P. Rockwood Benjamin Clapp and Jedediah  M. Grant as Presidents of the Seventies; and then Father John  Smith as the Patriarch of the whole Church.    President Young made some remarks concerning  appointing the First Presidency. He said, "the Spirit of the  Lord has been with us and we know what is right. It would have  been our right to have appointed the Presidency the first Conference  we held after Joseph's death but it was not wisdom to do it.  We have now whipped all our enemies with one hand tied  behind us and now it is time to organize the Church."    In speaking upon principle he said that  an honest man would not be dishonest neither would he follow  such men as Rigdon & Strang. The Sheep would follow such  as God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men would  follow the wolves. The Lord will rule in his Kingdom  I know how things have been and are and will be:    "Some suppose that by appointing a  Presidency it is robbing some of the rising generation or taking  away some one's rights but it is not so.    "Concerning persecution I will say that the  Lord will cause the wrath of men to praise Him. The remainder  will the Lord restrain." 
 It was resolved that we sustain Wm Snow  as the President of the High Priest Quorum and Moses Clawson  and Aaron Johnson as his Counsellors.    Joseph S. Clark was appointed as President  of the Elders Quorum and Charles Hopkins and Lewis Neley as  his Councillors.    James Allred was chosen as President  of the High Council in Patawattame County and Ira Overt  Aaron Johnson Wm. Draper Wm Snow Even M Green  Lyman Stoddard Silas Richards Henry W. Miller, Noah  S. Brindley and Heman Hyde were appointed with  their President to compose that Council.    Orson Hyde spoke concerning raising  teams and waggons for the Presidency and the names of those  were taken who had such to spare.    The Conference continued the next day  Orson Hyde addressed the meeting from Matthew V. 25-26 vers  Phineas Young spoke of his mission East and interview with  Oliver Cowdry and his feelings concerning the Saints. Joseph  Young remarked upon it that no man could go from our  midst and Councils and say that he was not warned against evil  and had not true principle taught him.    Orson Hyde read several resolutions against  stealing and after the second reading President Young said that  document would give the people the He said  he wanted to give a little counsel to Orson Hyde G. A. Smith  and all people: and the High Council.    "Will you hear it. Then let your paper alone  and keep pen off from it and it will save you much trouble.  The inocent will suffer by it. Send no man into Missouri  for crime but to Iowa as we are in that State."    He also expressed his feelings very plainly  against being taken prisoner at any time while he was inocent 
 Teams were again called for and President Kimball spoke  upon the subject. Remarks were also made concerning the wives of the  Batallion staying at Winter Quarters on this season. It was thought the  soldiers would have to come back for their bounty money and if so that they  would wish to find their families here.    President Young said that he was under the  necessity and obligation to do all he could for the soldiers families and  and that what he had was at their command. "And now what I want  to know is" he said "Will the Church take this responsibility from off  my sholders and let me go free?" All said "Yes."    A committee of five were appointed to locate the  poor the widows and others needing care. The meeting then was  dismissed.    During the evening Philo Dibble exhibited his  paintings of the Martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Carthage  Jail and Joseph Smith's last address to the Nauvoo Legion.  After the exhibition Wilford Woodruff gave a short address  upon the interest and importance of historical paintings of the Church  in the formation of a National Gallery of paintings.  Orson Pratt and Joseph Young made a few remarks upon the  same subject.    The next day of our Conference was a very  inspiring time and at the end of the following one ^day^ Sunday the  7th the Conference adjourned Sine die.    Messengers From the Mountains    During the 11th we were visited by three messengers  direct from the City of the Great Salt Lake City.  They were of  the Mormon Batallion had spent two months in the Valley  and had brought a large packet of letters for us. They left  the last of January.    The mildness of the Winter this year in 
 the Valley had been very remarkable and Providential to the Saints who  had arrived only just before its approach. The most of the Winter  was in November and December and broke in the middle of  January. When they left onto ^at^ the end of that month grass  was three inches high and the horses mules and sheep were fat  and the Saints had put in 1500 acres of wheat and calculated  to do double that amount. Everything seemed prosperous. There  had been 10 deaths in all the Camp and many births. My  father had been quite sick but was well again.    A Blessing Given to My Wife  April the 13th    During the evening of this day President Young and lady  and George A Smith and John Benbow called upon me and  spent two or three hours with us very pleasantly. Mrs Woodruff  asked a blessing under ^at^ the hand of President Young. So he  with George A Smith and myself laid hands upon her  head and part of the blessing pronounced by President Young  was as follows.    "Sister Phebe I lay my hands upon thy  head to bless thee in the name of the Lord. As thou art  going forth with they husband into the vineyard the blessing  of the Lord will go with thee. Thou shalt have power and  wisdom to teach the truth to thy friends and thy sex. Thou  shalt do a great work in connection with thy husband. Thou  shall save all thy children to return to the Church with Thy  husband who shall be prospered in his mission. Thou shalt  have power over all thy enemies and overcome all thy  besetments. Thou shall be looked up to as a  mother in Israel for counsel and instruction". 
 A Brother Shot.    On the 15th I went over the river to Log Tabernacle with  George A Smith and on our way learned that there was  much excitement  at the Point. The inhabitants had laid off Council Point into  a town or town lots. One line fence ran through John Geens  house and the people pulled down his fence to move it. He went  and put it up and took his rifle and swore he would kill the first  man who crossed the line of his fence or offered to touch it.    While the company stood looking at him  Brother Condit a shoemaker came out of his shop and walked up to  see what was going on and in doing so walked over the line and  John Geen shot him through the heart and he fell dead. A Frenchman  then struck Geen across the head and he fell as if he was killed  but he came to. They buried the dead brother and took his  murderer to Iowa city to be tried for his crime. He afterwards shot  himself in G. S. L City.    A guard was called for on the 26 to gauard [guard]  our cattle against the Omahas who had again began to kill our  cattle and two days afterwards Brother Benson arrived at night  from his mission East.    President Young made a feast on the 29th  and invited a few of his friends inasmuch as we were about to  seperate. The company was composed of Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff A P. Rockwood  Joseph Young E. T. Benson Levi Richards and their ladies.  We had a pleasant time, Bro Benson gave something of  an account of his begging mission in the East.    During the evening two men came  in from Salt Lake City but we did not get much news  from them. Brother Snow also arrived bring papers  and letters with him from which we learned much of the affairs  and revolutions going on in Europe. 
 May the 2nd ^2nd^ Orson Pratt George A Smith W Porter and  myself and Phebe W. Woodruff went to the upper bur[y]ing groung and took up  our little boy named Joseph and brought him to the bur[y]ing ground near  Winter Quarters and put him into the grave with Ezra Woodruff.  Their bodies are in the grave No 34. I put a stone at the head of  their graves marked J. E. W. for Joseph and Ezra Woodruff. I also  put a stone at the head of Sister Benbow's grave with J. B. on it  George A Smith put grave stones at the head and foot of all his relatives  lying there and O. Pratt did the same.    We packed up our trunks during the next  day preparing for our mission; and in the evening a company  of soldiers arrived from the Valley and brought a mail.    A letter came from the High Council  of Great Salt Lake City to the Presidency here. Our Valley  news informed us that the Saints had sowed 800 acres of wheat and  had inclosed 5000 acres of land within pale fences.    The Otoe Chiefs with many of their  tribe paid a visit to Winter Quarters on the 8th. They had  behaved themselves much more honourable towards us than  the Omahas.    All was bustle at Winter Quarters two  days later for a steamer had arrived and brought us flour groc[e]ries  freight and baggage. On the return of the boat the same day  several took passage in her among whom were Orson Pratt and  family bound for England.    President Young addressed the people on  Sunday the 14th and among many interesting remarks he said  he felt to bless the Saints who go on to the Valley or tarry at  Winter Quarters. He blessed the Potawattame land and  also said that the Saints never would be driven from the  Mountains except by insurrection among ourselves and he   had no fears of that.    On the 2th ^20th^ about 150 passengers 
 mostly Saints from England arrived per steamboat. Among them were Elders  Franklin and Samuel Richards. They brought with them the body of Elder  Sarine who had been dead some 12 days.    Next day I rode five miles out with President  Young to the Camp bound for Great Salt Lake City. There were about  three hundred waggons in the encampment.    At this date and during the two or three weeks  before and later the brethren at Winter Quarters were very active in  preparing and organizing for their journey to the Mountain and some  for their missions East and to Europe.    On the 24th President Young went out to the  Horn to organize the Camp and next day I took the parting hand of  Brother Brigham and let him have 25 dollars to help him buy a  yoke of cattle. On the following day I moved my family  and effects over the river and stoped near the ferry.    In company with Orson Hyde E. T. Benson  and others on the 2nd of June I rode out to the Horn to see Presidents  Young and Kimball and the Camp of Israel. We found on  our arrival that all had crossed the Horn and that Lorenzo  Snow and Zera Pulsipher captains of Hundreds had gone  on their journey with their Hundred each.    There were about 600 waggons in all that  had crossed the Horn. They had made a noble looking encampment  and a beautiful sight. There had been 4 burials here 2  infants and one aged woman and Brother Neff had a son ^named Charles^ 8 years of  age drowned at the Horn. His name was    I spent a little time with President Young  went through the encampment visited my acquaintences and wrote  a letter to brother John Benbow who had gone on in the foremost  companies.    Next day we took the parting hand of  Presidents Young and Kimball and many of the Saints recrossed  the Horn and returned to Winter Quarters. 
 Some days later I crossed the river to see President Richards  and to talk over the subject of his situation. He was lying sick and  had been for many months and Presidents Young and Kimball  had to go on with their companies and leave him behind. Besides  he had not means to go with and I was waiting to see if I could  not assist him in some way.    On the 14th I rode to George A Smiths  took him in my carriage rode to the Ferry dined with Brother  Benson and again crossed the river to see President Richards.    Just as we landed the blowing of the  bugle the rush to arms and report that Indians were coming  upon the people created quite an excitement. About 80 men assembled  but they were in a poor state to resist an attack. No Indians  however came; and the people were addressed by Amasa  Lyman George A. Smith and myself upon the necessity of being  well armed and prepared for Indian attacks while in an Indian  country. The men were required to met every night at sun-set  for drill.    The night previous to this the Omahas  came upon some Pawnees who were in the town and fired  arrows upon them which they returned with powder and ball  but none were killed.    On the Sunday I rode with my  family to the Tabernacle and President Richards laid his  curcumstances before the meeting. George A. Smith W. Woodruff  and O. Hyde urged the subject of our assisting President Richards  with waggons oxen &c to follow on to the Mountains and a  committee was appointed to go and obtain means for this purpose.    At the close of meeting I took the parting  hand with many of the Saints. Brother Richards blessed  me and said that the power of God should rest upon me on this  mission and that no power should prevail against me. Many  blessings he pronounced on my head. 
 Starting On My Mission  June the 21st 1848    On this day I started on my mission East. Our company  consisted of myself and family and Dominicas Carter with my carriage  Brother Russel Homer had a waggon and carried with him Libeas T. Coones  John Mc Murry and David M. Gammit. The whole of us were eleven  souls in our company.    On the 6th day of our journey at the close of  a heavy thunder storm Elders Hyde and Johnson and other drove up  drenched with rain.    Next day we reached Mount Pisgah and at night  held a meeting at that place which was addressed by Orson Hyde  and Wilford Woodruff, both constrained by the Spirit of God to speak  in much plainness to the people.    On the following day I had an interview with  Aaron York President of the Branch who laid before me the state of  affairs concerning himself and the Church at Mount Pisgah.    In the afternoon we held meeting. I addressed  the people and gave them counsel. Bro York followed and withdrew  from the Presidency of the Branch and we then appointed by the  voice of the people Edwin Whiting for President with brothers  Whiting and Demill for his counsellors.    We left Mount Pisgah on the 29th  of June and continued our journey.    On the 5th of July we spent the afternoon and  night with Brother James Williams after our drive of 15 miles  in the morning.    During the evening a hard thunderstorm  was approaching us. My mules were tied to a large oak on  the opposite side of the street and I felt impressed to move them  away to another place and I did so. I also removed my 
 children out of the carriage and made them a bed in the house ^correct it by copy where  Mrs Woodruff and myself slept.    We had just retired to bed when the storm  reached us with great fury and in a moment the large oak tree came  thundering to the ground with a terrific crash. Had I not have  moved my mules it probably would have killed them; had I not have  moved my carriage it would have crushed it to atoms and killed us for  the body of the tree fell where my carriage stood. It just  missed brother Kingsleys waggon. I consider my impressions  an interposition of Providence to save our lives.    Nauvoo    On Sunday the 9th in company with brothers Dana and   Kingsley I drove into Montrose dined with Bro Beebe and  then crossed the river on the steam ferry boat to Nauvoo.    We called upon Almon W Babbit and  then in company with John Snider I visited the Temple and went  over it from the bottom to the top. Here I once more had  a full view of the once beautiful but now desolate city Nauvoo.    The Temple was in a much better state of  preservation than I expected to find it.    The people in the city of Nauvoo were  much excited from a report that Elder Hyde would preach in the  Temple that day. They had made many threats upon the  subject and some came in waggons from the country to hear and  see; but the excitement was all among themselves for Elder  Hyde had given out no such appointment.    I returned to Almon W. Babbits and  found a man had come from Michigan to enquire after  the Gospel and to see the Saints. I was introduced to him  and he told his business. I preached the Gospel to him  one hour and then went to the river in Nauvoo and baptized him. 
 Afterwards we returned to brother John Snider's in the house built by George A. Smith  and here I confirmed him and ordained him an Elder gave him a licence to preach  and he went his way rejoicing.    Next day I called upon Elder Babbit spent the  morning with him and bought of him six volumes of the Times and Seasons  I then went to Hyrum Kimball's and dined with him and visited his  garden which was the finest in the Western country.    I sold my mules carriage and harness to Samuel  Beverly for 160 dollars and buffalo robe for 3 dollars and 70 cents and took  passage for Keokuck on the 11th and in the evening from thence took  passage on board the Lucy Bertram for St. Louis where we arrived  the next day.    On Sunday I met with the St Louis Branch of the Church  over which N. H. Felt presided. There was a large congregation  present and Orson Hyde addressed them ^upon the subject of the resurrection^ in the morning and I spoke  to them in the afternoon.    I spent the Monday in St. Louis and in the  evening took cabin passage with my family on board the Herald and  arrived at Lasselle two days later.    From thence next day I hired a man  to carry myself and family to brother Luther Scammans 21/2 miles  North of Lost Grove in Lamoile Bureau Co. Illinois. We found  him and ^our sister my wife's sister^ Rhoda and their family all well but our little daughter  who had been sick for some days was suffering much through the  journey and grew worse. Two days afterwards she died.    Shuah Woodruff was born  October the 28th 1847 and  Died July the 22nd 1848  Aged 8 months and 25 days    On Sunday the 23 of July we buried her in the garden of ^our^ brother ^in law^  Luther Scamman's a few rods South of his dwelling. She was  buried in a good black wallnut coffin set inside of an Ash box.  I put up a lime stone slab at the grave with the following 
 inscription well carved upon it with my own hand:    S. C. Woodruff Died July 22nd 1848 aged 9 months.    The children born to us up to this time were  Sarah Emma born July 14th 1838 Died July 17th 1840 aged  2 years and three days.  Wilford Jr born March 22nd 1840.  Phebe Amelia born March 4th 1842.  Susan Cornelia born July 25th 1843.  Joseph born in Liverpool England July 1845; Died  November 11th 1846 aged 1 year and 4 months.  Ezra Carter born Dec 9th 1846; Died Dec 11th 1846 aged  two days.    Shuah Carter born Oct. 28th 1847; Died July 22nd 1848 aged 8 m. 25 days.  The loss of our children ^much^ affected Mrs Woodruff and she refused  to be comforted because they were taken away.    While we were staying at Luther Scammans he  had 18 acres of wheat which he wanted stacked. So he  rigged two teams and I took them into the field and during  the day I hitched on to the waggons the wheat which grew  upon 12 acres of ground and a young man loaded it for me and  brothers Scamman and Carter put it into stacks as fast as  we brought it in. Good judges said it would yeild [yield] 25  waggons in one day 300 bushels of wheat making 3600 bundles.  It was a very hot day and I was not in good health. It was  as much as a well man ought to have done in two days and  it was imprudent in me as I had done no hard work for some  months. At night I was sore from the crown of my  ^head^ to the soles of my feet.    On the 31st I left brother Scammans  and arrived at Chicago on the 2nd of August and continued next  day and reached Buffalo on the 7th. Our son Wilford was 
 Eastern States Mission,   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,  No. 50 Concord Street,  Brooklyn, N. Y.    Brooklyn, Dec, 27, 1897. 189    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    My dear Brother: Just a word of advise: Senator Cannon often comes  to New York and is willing and kind enough to speak at our Sunday   services. The question is, will it be right for me to put an add   in the paper, stating that the Senator will speak and also to   publish a synopsis of his sermon. I am expecting to hold a con-  ference here in Greater New York in a few weeks and the Senator  has consented to come up and speak^,^ on one condition^,^ and i, e.,   that you will have no objection to me advertizing that the   senator will preach.    I understand th^a^t Senator Cannon is doing some confiden-  tial business for you and I would not wish to do anything that   would hinder or interfer with your business in any way. Brother   Cannon was with us last Sunday and the Sunday before here at our   services and we enjoyed his talk very much and I believe he can   do some good for the meritorious cause in which we are engaged.    We have plenty of work for go^o^d inteligent young men   who are humble and well equiped with a knowledge of the gospel.  We have some good singers with us from "Zion" and our services  are quite interisting and attractive. We have a few very nice   recent converts and expect to batpize two more next Sunday.    Praying God to bless you, I remain, with love,    Your brother, A. P. Kesler.

 American Fork  Jan. 21st 1893    President Wilford Woodruff    Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    I received your  Letter, stating that I had  been accepted as missionary.

 enough, and the Lord did not  require me to suffer any more.  I never received the house, or any  thing, for I suppose he forgot  all about me, having more important  Business to attend to. My house is   Built of inch Lumber, and very cold  in Winter & hot in summer.  I have not lived in a house that  was plastered in any part; since  I came to the mountains, but   that does not matter much, as  I am used to hardships of all  kinds. I have never called on the  Church for aid; until, the long  sickness, and Death of Mr Lightner  accompanied by a series of misfortunes  compelled me to apply to Brother  Taylor for assistance. Just before  my Husband died, Brother Taylor  allowed me two hundred Dollars  a year during his life time, but  intimated that he would incre^ase^  the amount at his deathâ€”he died  two years agoâ€”and left me in   debt over a hundred Dollarsâ€”a Jew  has my note for $8000 Eighty Dollars  and I have not a Dollar to pay   on itâ€”the rest of the debt is   paid. I have not received a cent  since Brothers ^Taylors^ death. I have  Aunt Gilbert to support, who; is   now in her Eighty-Eighth year of her  age, and a cripple. I borrowed  money to come up, hoping to see you,   I find my only alternative is to   pen these lines to you, hoping the  Lord will direct you in this matter  I was sealed to Brother ^Josephs^ family  in the Spring of 1831. And when  Zions Camp went to Missouri,   he received a Commandment  to take me for a wifeâ€”But was   afraidâ€”and I was not sealed  to him as a wife, until 1841â€”

 Blessing  upon the head of Thomas Bullock, setting him  apart for his mission to England, given in G. S. L. City  Sept 6, 1856 under the hands of P. P. Pratt, W. Woodruff  and Joseph Young.    Pronounced by W. Woodruff.  Brother Thomas Bullock in the name of the Lord  Jesus Christ and by virtue of the holy priesthood  we lay our hands on your head to set you apart  unto your mission whereunto you have been called  by the servants of the Lord, and we dedicate and  consecrate you to go on this mission, even unto Eng-  land to preach the gospel to the inhabitants of  your native land and country, and we pray  God to pour out his holy spirit upon you ^and^ that  you may be filled with the gift and power of the  holy ghost.  We say unto you Bro. Thomas you have  been faithful in many things that you have been  called to do, and unto the servants of God even  in the secret things of the kingdom of heaven, and  in keeping the records of the Church, and in as  much as you will be faithful and follow in  the same steps you shall be blest and prospered.  We bless you with every blessing pertaining to your  mission, for these are the feelings of your heart, and  we say the spirit of God shall rest upon you  and quicken your understanding. Go in peace and  trust in the name of the Lord and you shall be  satisfied that this mission will prove for your good,  we ask our father to preserve you in health and  life, that you may dream dreams and see visions,  and have revelations by day and by night.  Your  privileges have been great in your day and gene-  ration, and you have a fund in store of knowledge  which many of the children of men have been  deprived of, and we say unto you make good 
 use of that, and as you travel gather more out  of the multitude which is in the storehouse of  the Lord, and from his servants, even of those prin-  ciples of truth which shall guide the children of  men.  In as much as you are faithful you shall  fulfil your mission, be satisfied with it, bring  many into the kingdom, and again return to the  presidency of this Church and again rejoice with  them, and you shall see that it is one of the greatest  blessings that has ever come to you.  You shall be  preserved when the Cholera and desease shall be  upon the right and upon the left, and even  while upon this mission you shall see sorrow  and affliction multiplied among the children  of men, and in the midst of all those things  you shall be preserved, and live to return in peace   to your family and friends.  These and all other  blessings which you desire in righteousness shall  be given; we seal you up to eternal life, and   confer upon you every gift and blessing, and  we say that the promises shall all be fulfilled,  and we ask God our Heavenly Father to fulfil them  and to give you the desires of your heart, and to  sustain you at all times, and in every emergency  and time of need, and we will ascribe all the  honor to God and the Lamb for ever and ever. Amen.    J. V. Long, Reporter  S. A. Long Scribe    [sideways text] Thomas Bullock's  Blessing [end of sideways text]

 taken very sick on the road with a species ofâ€”    After a long and tedious journey with my family of  2595 miles from Council Bluffs to Boston by land and waggons rivers lakes  canals railroads &c we arrived at the city of Boston on the 12th of August  where I found Elders Felt and Robins and in a few days also met here Elders  O. P. Rockwood and Jesse C Little.    Here I tarried until the 26 holding meetings associating  with the Saints gathering up the exciting news of the world writing letters &  directing the affairs of the Church and then went to Bradford with Elder  Leonard Hardy.    On the Sunday we held meetings with the Saints  at the Samuel B Hardy's at East Bradford and while at this place  I spent a few hours with Milton Holmes who was quite gloomy  feeling unhappy and knowing not what course to take.    I rode to Lowell on the 29th and visited  the Iron Foundries &c; and in the evening met with the few Saints  at that place.    Next day I parted with Bro Hardy he for  Peterborough and I for Boston to my family. Here I tarried with  the Saints until the 4th of September and held meetings on the Sunday  with Elders A. Corden Lewis Robins and N. H. Felt present.    On the 4th I and my family left Boston  in the express train for Portland. Through some misunderstanding  the two trains waited for each other 3 or 4 hours so we did  not get into Portland till 1 o'clock at night. We found our  brother Ilus F. Carter waiting for us and he took us home and  we spent with him the night.    Next day we called upon our brother  Ezra Carter and family and ascertained that Father Carter had  been in the day before to carry us out home with him but not  finding us he went away quite disapointed. So Mrs Woodruff  thought it best to go out to her fathers house to see her aged  father once more and she took stage and went out and spent 
 the night with him. He was quite out of health but got well almost  immediately as soon as he saw her. He was 76 years of age and  a visit from his daughter Phebe was like as from one rose from the  dead    I left Portland with my children next day and rode  to Scarborough to Father Carters and was glad to once more see  him and sister Foss and their families    On the afternoon of the 12th Father  Carter, G B. ^Ira Carter^ Foss Rhoda Foss and myself and Mrs Woodruff  left Scarborough to visit Freedom Moulton and family at Wilton  which we reached on the second day having left however sister  Rhoda on the way.    Here Sarah B Foss Phebe Woodruff  and Shuah C. Moulton all our sisters had the privelege of  meeting once more together. It had been 8 years since they  had met before. It was a happy family union.    Freedom Moulton had a good form of 100 acres  and had taught school 120 months. He and his wife Mrs  Woodruff's sister treated us kindly during our visit. We parted  from them on the 19th and reached Scarborough on the  second day.    The day after our return we had a family  meeting in the evening at Father Carter's. Our father was  present also our brother Joseph Fabyan Carter. We had a good  time. I expressed my feelings in plainess concerning my  course and the dealings of the Lord with and and Phebe did the  same and said that her parents and friends would know in eternity  why she had taken the course she had in leaving her father's  house and following the Saints. The Spirit of the Lord  was with us. Brother Fabyan Carter spoke for a few  minutes and Father Carter said he was satisfied with us and  if there was a society of Saints where he could spend the few  remaining days of his life which he had to spend on Earth 
 he should be glad to. It was an interesting time to us all.    On the 23 Mrs Woodruff and Mrs Foss carried me in a  waggon to Saco and I then left them and took the cars with brother D. Carter  for Boston where I spent a few days in the performance of my ministeral  duties among the Saints.    On the 27th I was at Worcester. There was  a cattle show there on that day; and here were some of the finest oxen  I ever saw in my life. I saw one large ox that girted 10 feet  and weighed alive 4200 pounds; two Durham oxen which were two of  three twins calved at a time 2200 lbs each; a mamouth Durham cow  girt 8 feet, weight 2500 lbs; and other remarkable specimens in the  cattle line.    In the evening I took the cars to Northbridge  We were loaded down alomst to suffocation and the cars croweded out on  the platforms until the people were in danger of falling off.    I stayed with the Saints at Northbridge  over the next day and returned to Worcester. Here I visited the  insane hospital which contained about 500 occupants. Their appartments  were neat clean and comfortable. Bro ^Jess^ Haven went through  the Asylum with me.    I arrived at New York on the 30th and  on Sunday the 1st of October met with the Saints there, and  preached to them. The Presiding Elder was gone and I recommended  Bro T. Cartwright for that position and we appointed him and I   ordained him to the office of an Elder. The records represented  at this time 65 members in the New York Branch    I spent several days with the Saints of  New York visiting them &c and then left for Philadelphia on  the 4th.    Next day I called upon Col. Kane clerk   of the United States Court. There were many persons in  his office yet as soon as he saw me he laid aside all  other business and came and grasped my hand and seemed 
 much delighted to see me. He talked with me about 15 minutes about upon  a variety of subjects and I then retired from his office.    There was quite a display to day the 5th  in Philadelphia in depositing the remains of Comodore James Biddle  in the vault of the Biddle family. This was done with military  honours. There were about 20 military companies and three  bands of music accompanied with a dislay of flags from  public buildings chiming of bells firing of minute guns from  the navy yard &c. Commodore Biddly is the eleventh   Commodore buried in Philadelphia up to this date and the  8th or ninth who had died there. Those preceding him  were Commodores Decatur Bainbridge Barry Truston Shaw  Hull Rodgers Porter Elliot and Dallast.    Two days later Elder W. J. Appleby  and myself again called upon Col Kane. His office was full  of business men but as as soon as he saw me he came directly  as cordially as before and conversed with us with deep interest upon  our cause. He said he had fears that there was trouble  brewing against us in the West of Iowa and he wished me to  give him the earliest information of anything against us.    On the Sunday I met the Saints  with many strangers in the old Mormon Hall or Marshall  Hall. I addressed them in the morning from the words  of Jesus to his disciples that "as it was in the days of Noah  and Lot so also should it be in coming of the Son of Man. [##Matthew 24:37##] I  had the power of God with me during the day.    I gave Brother Appleby a recommend  to preach and organzie Churches in Pa. N. J. and Delaware in  my absence.    On the 10th I parted with the Saints in  Philadelphia and rode by rail to Newmark and the next day  held a meeting at the house of brother Provost and organized a  branch of the Church called the Newmark and Spring Garden 
 Branch and appointed brother John Sanderson of Roway the Presiding Elder  over the Branch at this place.    During the following days to the 18th I visited  New York Brooklin Hempstead and Northwalk Newark ^Norwalk^ Ct. being at New York and  Brooklin several times in the interval.    The following is an extract of a letter written by  me to my wife on the 18th:    "I have been much blessed with the Spirit of  God since I saw you. I have felt more of the presence and power of  God with me than I expected to have enjoyed on this Eastern mission  I have felt that some one has prayed much for me of late. I wonder  if it was Phebe? I know you pray much for me. I feel its power  and prize it much. I have never felt such a desire to prove worthy  of your confidence and trust, shun every appearance of evil keep out  of the path of all temptation and do right in all things as I have  of late.    "I have had much of the spirit of secret prayer,  have poured out my soul in supplication before God with tears of joy  while the visions of my mind have been open at times to see  clearly my duty to my God, to my wife and children, to the  Saints and the world at large.    "I have also seen the awful and certain  judgements of God which like a gathering storm are ready to burst  upon the whole Gentile world, especially this nation who have  heard the sound of the Gospel rejected it with all the testimony  of the servants of God stoned and killed the Prophets become  drunk with the blood of martyrs and Saints and at last driven  the entire Church with the Priesthood and keys of Eternal life  out of their midst into the Wilderness and Mountains of Israel  By so doing they have turned the last key which seals their  condemnation which lingereth not and their damnation which  slumbereth not: therefore they cannot escape. Not only  the Holy Ghost but that portion of the Spirit of God that 
 enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, which like a faithful  ambassador who has finished his work, is rapidly takings it flight from  Gentile America and Wo! Wo! Wo is their doom".    I was at New Haven on the 21st. I   called at Mr S. Turtles and found Sister Turtle sick. She was as  yellow as saffern. A number of comforters like those  those who came to Job [##Job 2:11##] called upon her and reproached her  because she was sick inasmuch as she professed to believe  in God and asked why she did not call upon her Elders  to heal her. This was done to reproach her and she spoke  out and said, "O that the Lord would send brother Woodruff here."  This was but a few moments before she received a note from  me stating that I was coming and when I laid hands upon  her she was healed indeed and I felt to praise the Lord.    Next day was Sunday and I met  with the Saints at Father Jairus Sandford and among others  present was Mr Smith Turtle and his wife who was healed the  day before. Soon after she left home her daughter came  to the house to take care of her supposing her to be very low  but found she had gone to meeting. I preached twice  during the day with the Spirit and power of God and in  the afternoon administered the Sacrament    Before I left this place I felt strongly  impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to ordain Elder Jurius  Sandford to the office of High Priest and Patriarch which I did  on the 23rd of Oct 1848 he being 85 years of age 10 months  and 2 days old. He had done much good to the Church  He paid into the hands of Elder Sarine $267 dollars for  his tithing 163 for Sarine's own use and in all had given  700 dollars for tithing and the assistance of the Saints and  the Elders. I felt the old Patriarch rejoicing in  God; and then started on the 24th to North Haven rode  round with Orrin Mansfield of that place to see the Saints 
 held meeting with them and advised them to keep up their organization of the  branch and hold meetings.    A Great Day at Boston    Oct 25 1848    I took the rail at North Haven and arrived in Boston at 12 o'clock  and got into an Omnibus to go to Cambridgeport but was blocked up  by the great procession marching through the city in celebration of the  introduction of the water from the Long Pond into the city of Boston.    This procession was two hours and 30 minutes  passing any given point and was considered the grandest display ever  made on any occassion in an American city and there was supposed  to be more people in Boston than ever known before. The procession  itself was said to be 7 miles long. Archways were formed across  the streets decked with evergreens and flowers and a pyramade  of evergreen and flowers overtop bearing a great variety of mottos.    The procession started from the Common  15 minutes past 12 at noon. First came a powerful band of  Lancers. Then followed 30 military companies in full uniform  and several other bands of music. Next came the fire companies  of the city with their engines ornamented with wreathes flowers &c;  following were the fire companies from the neighboring towns  After these came a cavalcade of 500 gentlemen and a few ladies  A boy's fire engine drawn by two ponies was followed by  two of the largest size water pipes mounted on a platform  drawn by seven black horses bearing the inscriptions: "First  pipe laid April 19th 1847": "Water introduced into the city Oct 25  1848."    After this came a brick layers platform  with impliments of their trade followed by a host of workmen.  Next were the Boston Boat Clubs with their boats and after  these the Boston Port society with a ship fully rigged and 
 manned under the command of Father Taylor: theSalem East Indian  Marine and the old Marine societies followed bearing in their ranks  the old Palanquin which had not been seen in public for 40 years  This was borne by 6 stout Negroes. In a carriage drawn by  4 horses was a large full rigged moddle of the famous but unfortunate  privateer the Grand Turk. Other carriages followed containing  specimens of American clocks goods carpeting &c.    After these came Oak Hall expresses  Adams & Mrs Ridders. A printing office passed on  wheels with workmen all at work strewing papers cards &c among  the mass as they proceded onwards followed by Faneuil Hall  market in minature with a grand display of beef mutton pork  fowles fish vegitables &c which I presume was a temptation  to the hungry crowded lookers on. The market men came next  in great force with badges on their hats.    A stuffed Elephant passed mounted upon  a carriage with 3 persons riding on his back; also an artifical  flower manufactory drawn by 6 horses containing 12 young girls  dressed in white all busy making flowers. There was an  apple tree filled with fruit with Adam and Eve picking it and  the serpant on the tree. All the Masonic and Odd Fellow's  societies of Boston were in the procession and hundreds of flags  making a costly array were brorne [borne] onwards.    The first Division of the Procession was  under the direction of the honourable John C. Park and consisted  of the Mayor of Boston Committee of Arrangements; Water Committee  Water Commisioners & Engineers, Aldermen, President of the  Common Council, Members of the Common Council, High    Sheriffs of the State; the Governor and suite &c, &c, escorted  by the Boston Cadets and flanked by the city Greys. After  these was a long array of civil and military functionaries,  representatives of foreign countries bearing the tri colorured flag,  the Clergy, Medical Faculty, Editors, Members of the bar 
 Governments of the Neighbouring cities students of Harverd University, Mercantile  Library Association in full array and scores of other companies too numerous  to name.    All along the route of the Procession the public  buildings hotels and private residences were crowded with human beings  and the Common was literally covered.    At half past 4 o'clock the Government of the  city headed by the chief marshal reached the Common and took their seats  on a decorated platform in the centre of the reservoir after which lengthy  speeches were made by the Mayor and Mr Hale. At the close  of the speeches the Mayor arose and said:    "Fellow citizens, it is proposed to admit the  waters of Lake Cochituate into the city. All those in favour  will say Aye!"    The response was in a voice of thunder. The  signal was then given and upwards gushed a pure column of water  8 inches in diameter 80 feet into the air and falling again into  the reservoir. The cheering of the people at this moment was  overwhelming. The night was passed with fireworks and  illuminations.    While beholding these things going on the  words of the Lord came with weight upon my mind which says  "Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands flock together  there while wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there  a traveller," I went to Brother A Badlams and spent  the night.    Next day I took train with brother Nathaniel  Corey to New Bedford and read an account of the burning of the  Temple of Nauvoo by our enemies.    After visiting the Saints at various places  and attending to Church affairs I reached Scarborough again and  found my wife and children at her sister Foss'    Here I remained with our friends until 
 the 17th of November when I parted with Father Carter and the rest of our  family ^there^ and with my wife and children to ^took^ the rail to Boston and thence  by omnibus to Cambridgeport where I received letters from Orson Pratt  and others all bearing good news of the progress of the work of the  Lord in England.    I took a house in Cambridgeport for my  family and continued labouring with the Saints in Boston until  the 2nd of Dec when I took train and stage to Peterboro where  I found Bro Jesse C. Little and Leonard Hardy; and with  them and the Peterbow Saints I spent the interval to the  9th when I rode to Guilson and stayed with Chilon Mack  Solomon Mack and their Father Capt. Mack came in and spent  the night with me. Capt. Mack and Lucy Smith mother  of the Prophet Joseph were brother and sister.    Next day was Sunday and I preached  to the few Saints who were in that place and on the  following day with Solomon Mack ^rode^ to Bro Waldos and  next day ^the following^ to Walpole Branch where I found difficulties had  existed for several years.    During the 5 following days I was  at Alworth Peterboro and Lowell at which places I preached  and on the 18th of Dec I returned to my family at Cambridgeport.    All the papers and news of the day  were full of important and stirring events of the wars and  revolutions in Europe and startling developments ^in America^. Among  those of America was the discovery of Go[l]d by the Mormons  in upper California and the rush of the nation to the  gold field like the rushing of a horse to battle.    The cholera had again commenced in  New York yet the gold panic was so much greater than  the fever of the cholera that it was hardly noticed.    Among the letters which I obtained on  my return to my family was one from Orson Hyde who 
 informed me that Oliver Cowdery had come back to the Church had  made satisfaction and was voted to come in by the door of baptism. He  was the first man baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints in this last dispensation under the hands of Joseph Smith the  Prophet and one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon  After being out of the Church seven years he had now returned again.    Ten days more of ministeral labour in  Boston and the year 1848 was brought to a close.    Sypnosis of 1848    During this year of our Lord 1848 the "Fig Tree" hath  rapidly put forth her leaves and blosomed for the summer. It  is a year which has laid the foundation for the fulfilment of  more prophecy and revelation than has been fulfilled in centuries  in other ages. Thrones have been cast down kingdoms  overturned the power of the Pope of Rome broken and he driven  from the papal dominion; and All the nations of the earth have  been convulsed. Revelations wars anarchy and confusion have  followed each other in rapid succession; cholera plagues and  famine came in the train and last of all though not the least  in importance the foundation is laid for the dissolution  of the American Government. While these things were  going on a spirit has prevailed for the return of the Jews  and the rebuilding of Jerusalem; some 7000 Latter-day Saints  have gathered into the valley of the Mountains by the Great  Salt Lake and the Saints in the valley of Sacramento  have discovered vast quanties of gold the report of which has  ran like electricity through the world and tens of thousands  are flocking to the gold fields of California.    The revolutions of Europe commenced with  France. The people rose en masse and had a three days 
 ^fight^ at the end of which they drove Louis Philipi out of France with all the  royal family. The people entered the T[ourelles] took the throne  upon their shoulders carried it into the streets and dashed it to pieces  on the ground. They then undertook to establish a Republican  government.    It was said that in the first 3 days fight  there were only 500 killed; but afterwards a reaction took place with  a fight and some 15000 killed. Finally they organized a government  and at the end of '48 the world was anxiously waiting the election of  a President of the French Republic and prophesying much future  bloodshed before the issue of this revolution was reached.    The German States and Prussia next  followed in revolution. Austria arose and drove her king  from his throne but he afterwards returned with his armies  and bombarded Vienna 8 days and reorganized his kingdom  giving to his people a milder form of government and more  toleration and still his throne was in danger.    The Emperior of Russia had also much  war and his throne was in some uncertainty the Irish had  made a struggle to throw off the British yoke but failed. The  inhabitants of Rome had risen up in their might and compelled the  Pope to change after change and at last dashed his power to the  earth assassinated his councillors and driven ^him^ from the Papal  chair which has stood unshaken for centuries and he has sought  protection by fleeing to other nations.    While this was going on in foreign  countries turn our eyes for a moment to America. She was  a nation blessed above all other nations under heaven yet she  had recently shed the blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs  and Saints and had suffered mob rule to take the place  of Constitution law and order. And what position is he  in at the close of this year. One of her States Ohio has  disgraced herself by her Legislature sitting for weeks in 
 fighting for mastery instead of organizing and doing the business of the  people; and the leaders of the whole nation herself at Washington had  also been engaged in ^engendering^ the spirit of party strife hatred disunion and war  They had met in seperate parties laying plans for the disolving of the  Union and the anihilation of the American Government and while  the Senators and Statesmen of the Slave States have met in convention  and resolved that if slavery in the District of Columbia was abolished  or prohibited in California they would immediately disolve the  Union lay Taxes upon the shipping of the free States &c, the citizen  and Statesmen of the free States had also met and had resolved upon  the struggle between North and South unless they could carry their  measures.    Yet while parties were growing more and  more determined and divided the public mind seemed to be blinded  as to the result of these movements and ignorant of the fruit which  would grow up from the seed of their own sowing. They had  eyes but saw not, ears but hear not, hearts but do not understand." [##Matthew 13:15##]  But the servants of God and his Prophets have seen the end with  as much certainly as did Noah Lot and Jesus the things  concerning Jerusalem Sodom and Gomorrow [Gomorrah] and the antedelivuan  world.    During the past year also the Asiatic  cholera had marched through the earth had arrived in the  States and was sweeping down its thousands daily.    Turning our eye towards Zion on the other  hand the Lord had been favouring for. The Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been organized with  a First Presidencyâ€”namely Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball  and Willard Richards who had gathered to the Mountains of  Israel in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake took with  them about 3000 souls some 8000 head of  cattle making  at this date a population of about 7000 Saints in the City  of the Great Salt Lake; while those of the Brethren who 
 had located near the Bay of San Francisco had discovered mines of wealth  in gold and other precious and useful ore which had created an immense  excitement throughout the world.    My Travels in 1848    I travelled during this year 4850 miles    Meetings & Councils    I attended with the Twelve Apostles 12 Councils  and I held during the year of public meetings 44    I baptized 14 persons confirmed 14 ordained to  the office of Patriarch Jurious Sanford aged 88 85 and also  ordained one President of the Seventies.    Administrations & Blessings    I administered to 20 sick persons some of whom were  remarkably healed and glorified God and I blessed according  to the order of the Church 10 children.    I wrote 60 Letters and received 39.    Thus had been the events and general affairs of the world  of the Church and myself during the year 1848 and the  Spirit whispered to me that the year eighteen hundred and  forty nine would be a year of calamities and moment  to the nations of the earth. 
 On Monday morning the 1st day of the year 1849  the Steamer Europia arrived bringing news of the election of Prince  Louis Napoleon as President of the French Republic; also of the   abdication of the Emperor of Austria in favour of his young  nephew and of dreadful starvation in Iceland and the raging  of the Cholera in Europe. Tidings also from South America  was of a similar character. At New Orleans the cholera was  raging to such a frightful extent that the inhabitants were  fleeing business suspended captains mates clerks and hands  dying off and the steamboats had to stop running.    I received a letter brought by brother  Goodridge from brother Josiah G. Hardy wishing me to visit a  sister who was possessed of an evil spirit so I accompanied  him to West Newbury 40 miles.    I tarried around this neighbourhood  until the 8th and then returned to Boston to my family.    Next day I received letters from  Orson Spencer and Dan Jones from England. Brother Jones 
 expressed his feelings on warm terms concerning my letters to him and  said he felt encouraged by them to go ahead in the name of the Lord.  He informed me that he had raised up a Branch at Myrther of over  800 members and the total of members of the Churches raised up by  him in Wales was 2747.    The whole representation of the Churches in  England ^Scotland and Wales^ represented at the General Conference at Manchester Aug 14th  1848 amounted to 350 Branches 929 Elders 1185 Priests,  608 Teachers 341 Deacons, 17902 members. There had  been added since May 31st 1846, 8467 souls to the Church  Orson Pratt was now the President of the Churches in the  British Isles.    Elder Dan Jones added "I have  published in the Welsh language 48 different kinds and  size of pamphlets comprising more original matter than the  Book of Mormon Doctrines and Covenants and voice of  Warning and have circulated one million eight hundred  thousand of pages all of which preach night and day to  rich and poor the eternal truths of Mormonism and  cheer the honest hearted. Many learned and some very  noted men have embraced the work. I have been   enabled to subdue my foes many of the gifts of the Spirit  are manifest. One young man who had been deaf and  dumb 8 years was healed when coming up out of the waters  of baptism so he both heard and spake was ordained  to the Priesthood and is now preaching the Gospel with  success."    Captain Dan Jones was adding  to the Churches in Wales 150 per mouth. Elder  Orson Spencer also wrote to me many good things  He said in his letter to me:    "The work is rolling forth in  much power. I have been of late stiring up the 
 Saints to pay their tithing. I have visited many of the Conferences and feel  encouraged to believe I shall gather a good sum for the Temple.    The addition to the Churches continue to  be great. The migration falls much short of the increase. There  may be 1500 Saints emigranted this season but what is that among  so many    "The Saints wax very bold and utter their  testimony with much assurance in the Holy Ghost. It is truly  delightful to see them pushing sectarian churches and demolishing  human creeds as so much hay and stubble. The weak are  becoming strong and the Gentiles marvel.    "You would be astonished to see the issue of  books stars and tracts from the Star Office. Every fortnight  the issue of Stars has doubled since I took charge in '47 and  all other works in equal ration and the tide of truth rolls  irresistibily through the land."    Some two weeks later Almon W. Babbit  called upon me and spent the evening and conversed upon a variety of  subjects. He had been to Washington and had spent a length of time  and called to see me to induce me to go there with him and get  an introduction to the members of Congress in case the Church should  wish me to do any business there another year. He said he had  been labouring while there to so arrange the Territorial bills  as to have a Territorial government in the Great Bason North America  to be called the Utah Territory embracing 300 miles in length  He thought it would be necessary for the inhabitants of Great Salt  Lake Valley to organize a State government &c. He had got  a Post Office established at Salt Lake City and Elder Haywood  appointed Post Master; also had got Post Offices established at  Garden Grove & Mount Pisgah. He was very familiar with the  members from Iowa and Illinois and Thomas Benton of Missouri  came to him just before he left and shook hands with him familiarly  After hearing all Almon Babbit had to say I concluded that he 
 was at work upon his own book and not by the Council of the  Presidency of the Church. So I resolved that my health calling and the  spirit within me would not permit me to leave the business upon  which I was sent and go to Washington.    On the 24th I received three letters from  George A Smith E. T. Benson and Dominicas Carter from the  Bluffs and two from the Valley one from A.O. Smoot.    The letter from brother Smoot gave an  account of the affairs in the Valley since his arrival there. He  said the organization of the Presidency was received in the Valley  and all business attended to that was necessary and wrote of the  ravages of the crickets upon the crops &c.    George A. Smith and E. T. Benson wrote  that they had organized 50 Branches of the Church at Council  Bluffs and all were doing well. Most of the brethren who  went into the army had returned to their families. They had  built a new Tabernacle in Pottawatomie County. Brother Egan  and 12 others had arrived on the 7th of Dec with the latest news  from Great Salt Lake. They left on the 13th of October.  President Young had arrived at the Valley on the 20 of Sept  and Heber C. Kimball on the 24th. Charles C. Rich had  been appointed President of the Stake and John Young and Erastus  Snow his councillors. Arrangements were being made for  inclosing an additional field of 1100 ^acres^; 860 men had taken shares  in it varying from 5 to 10 acres the smallest lots being near  the city to accomodate the mechanic. All the buildings of  the fort were to be moved on to city lots except the square  enclosed by the Pioneers. The Indians were friendly and  it was considered safe to settle on farms. A new city  had been laid out 10 miles North of the Temple Block and  another about 10 miles South. All the lots surveyed  had been taken up and an addition had been made running  to the mountains on the East side. The Pioneers claims 
 were to be respected. Elder Addison Pratt had arrived from the Sanwich  Islands; a company of Saints that went to California on board the Brooklin  were en route  for the Valley; Willard Richards and Amasa Lyman  were within three days drive of Salt Lake City when the express  left and Dr Richards was driving his own team.    Elder Kimball wrote that they had raised  squshes in the Valley from 63 to 84 lbs and turnips 8 1/2 lbs.    Parley Pratt made a vegitable dinner for  the Presidency when they arrived and in the bill of fare were  items: green corn green peas green beans cucumbers beets  parsnips carrots onions potatoes turnips squashes pumpkins  pies cabbage mush mellons water mellons cantelopes, corn  bread, wheat bread, corn stalk, molasses rost beef &c.    Walker the famous Utah Chief had  visited the Saints in the Valley with his band of rifflemen  He said he always wished to live in peace with our people.  He wanted his children to grow up with ours as brothers. His  people should not steal from our people: if they did we were to  let him know and he would punish them and stop it. The  brethren told him they did not want his men to steal from the  Californians for we were at peace with them. Walker replied  my men hate the Spaniards and will steal from them and  I cannot help it.    Brother Danial Browett Allen and Cox  were all killed by a band of diggers in the Californian mountains  as they were exploring a new pass through the mountains  They were surrounded when asleep and killed with stones. One  hundred dollars worth of gold dust was found on the ground belonging  to brother Allen. Their bodies were stripped of their clothes  and then buried by the Indians. This occured 40 miles  from the settlement on the Sacramento. Their bodies were  found by a company who followed them. These brethren  I baptized in Herefordshire soon after I commenced preaching 
 at John Benbows. Brother Browett especially had been an earnest true  hearted Latter-day Saint and I know nothing to the contrary of the  others. They went into the army as soldiers in the Mormon Battalion  and have died as martyrs in their mission.    Brother Carter wrote that during the  Conference in the Valley Lyman White had been retained in  his standing for they did not know that the Church had withdrawn  fellowship from him at the Bluffs nor had received his pamplet.    On the 2nd of Feb I received 24 Nos  of the Millennial Star and from a letter written by Parley  P. Pratt August 1848 I gathered the following concerning  the prosperity of the Valley in the first year of our settlement:    "We are blessed in gardens in wheat and  corn and in all things I have set my hand unto. I have  raised some sixty bushels of good wheat without irrigation  a few bushels of rye and oats and my corn in the field  looks as well as any corn I ever saw in the States. The  wheat crop exceeds all expectation. Oats do better than in the  States say 60 bushels to one of the sowing in good ground. Every  kind of vegetables suited to the Northren latitudes does well  Levi Hancock sowed seven pounds weight of California wheat  on the 14th of April and reaped 22 bushels the latter part of   July. He sowed half a bushel of common English wheat  on an acre and half and reaped upwards of twenty bushels  One grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two ears  Barley that was sown ripened and was reaped and carried  off. The land then was irrigated and produced from the  roots a fresh crop four times the quantity of the first crop  Oats that were sown produced a good crop and cleared. The  roots again sprung up and produced another beautiful crop  Three crops of peas ripened on the same spot of ground and  the peas of the crop raised used for seed. Beet sead planted  this Spring produce beets as thick as a mans leg and go to 
 seed and yield a large quantity. Cabage seed planted this Spring produces  seed again."    Sunday the 4th I had a meeting in the forepart  of the day with my family My wife and children come together once  a week. We sang and prayed and then I taught them the things  of the Kingdom of God; after which I was accustomed to break bread with  and partake of the Sacrament with them.    On this Sabbath my only son being nine  years of age and a good youth and under the influence of the Spirit  of God I ordained him to the office of Priest to officiate in that  office in his father's household until he arrived at suitable age to  officiate in the Church    My wife Phebe when I was away from my  family attending to the affairs of the Church would call my children  together and teach and instruct them to pray and to understand the  principles of faith and the Gospel and now my son Wilford  could administer the sacrament to my family when debared  the privilege of attending meeting at a Branch of the Church.    I met with the Boston Branch of the  Church and as Bro Badlam the Presiding Elder had left for  California I thought it wisdom to appoint another and so  I appointed Elder Stephen H Pierce.    On the 15th of February I wrote a letter  to President Young and Council containing two sheets of foolscap  paper written in my journal hand giving at account of my  leaving Council Bluffs my meetings at Mount Pisgah and  Garden Grove my providential delivery from death visit to  Nauvoo and the Temple meeting at St. Louis death of our  child on the journey arrival at Boston burning of Albany  stay of my family in Maine and return to Cambridge port.  I also represented my travels among the Churches the branches  as numbering 808 ^members^ the capacity of the Saints to gather  to the Valley of the Rocky Mountains the course I had pursued 
 in teaching, the report of the Elders that the people had no interest in  hearing the Gospel in this land the number we had baptized &c  I also wrote another letter to President Young and Council concering the  visit of Babbit course of T. H Benton, William Smith's appearance  and teaching gold fever excitement &c. I also wrote an Historical  letter to the Historian's office made extracts from my journal concerning  the leading features of the signs of the times the revolutions of  Europe the return of the Jews spread of the Gospel progress of the  work in the British Isles and the affairs of America.    March the 1st of this year I was 42  years of age. The following is an extract from a letter written  by me this day to Orson Pratt in Liverpool:    Cambridgeport March 1st 1849    Elder Pratt:    Beloved Brother,    As this is my birthday also the first  day of Spring my mind is led more than usual this morning  to reflect upon the signs of the times and while meditating upon  Zion and her swift Messengers my mind flies across the  ocean to a large company of them who are the "horns" of Joseph  to push the people together from the ends of the earth.    These meditations create a desire to  converse a few moments with Brother Pratt. So while all  nature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day which awakes  man from his slumber I seat myself to say a few words  to you.    I said this was my birthday. Yes I  am 42 years old this day. How such figures look to a  man while counting up his years in this probation. The  very sight of them crowd into ^ones^ mind a flood of thought even  more than tongue can utter or pen can write. The  last sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring 
 to preach the Gospel and build up the kingdom of God in connection with  my brethren.    The past is gone. I have no desire to recall  it. I would not wish to live my life over again if I could. I   feel like looking forward and not backward. I have a great desire  that I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousness  honouring the Priesthood and my calling saving the souls of men and  building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a place with the  faithful at the end of the race.    Turn my eyes which way I will either towards  Babylon or Zion and I find the movements and signs of both fully  keeping pace with the wheels of time.    It is deeply interesting to see hear feel and  live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the whole earth  which is rushing like a mighty cataract to finish its work.    While the Jews were highminded and in  the light of their pride the Son of God in Lamb like meekness  bowed to the ordinance of baptism and all the rites of the Gospel  and commandments of his father looking forward to the day when  he should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward upon  his head. So at the present day while Emperors Kings Princes  Lords Nobles Presidents and the great men of Babylon have  been making a desperate effort to maintain their dignity and  appear to good advantage before the whole earth many of the  noblest spirits that ever dwelt in flesh like Jesus and the Apostles  have been meekly submitting to the ordinances of the Gospel  and like little children been subject to the authority of the Holy  Priesthood. They have made every sacrifice required and  laboured day and night to build up Zion that the honest in  heart and meek of the earth may have a place to flee to  in order to escape the just judgement of that God whose rod  is now suspended in the heavens and about to fall upon the  earth and lay Great Babylon with all her greatness pomp 
 power and glory in the dust.    My prayer to God is that every Elder of Israel  and Saint of God throughout the whole earth may be encouraged to  labour dilligently and faithfully while the day of harvest lasts  for soon night will come when no man can work: then they  will be just as sure of their reward as was their chief  captain and Head.    Sunday the 4th I met a congregation  of Saints and Strangers at brother Birds at 2 o'clock. Elder  Whipple from the Valley was present and Elder Jesse  P. Haven from the Bluffs. We had a full house and  myself and the newly arrived brethren addressed the people  After which I administered the sacrament and confirmed  two persons and blessed three children.    A curious circumstance took place  in the history of the Presidents of the United States this year  President Polk went out of office of on Saturday the 3rd of March  and President Taylor was installed on the Monday so that  for one day the United States was without a President in  consequence of the Sunday intervening.    On the 13th of March I called upon  Francis N. Mitchell stone seal engraver &c 15 Tremont  Row Boston and searched a record entitled General Armoury  of England by John Burnard Burke Heraldry. I found  my coat of arms to be the following.    Woodroffe or Woodruff Lord Mayor of  London 1579 Payle ^Poyle^ ^Pahyle^ Co Surrey Gn. on a chev. ar, three Bucks  heads erased Sa. a chief perfess nebulee Sa and ar crest  A Dexter arm embowed Habited with leaves vert holding  in the hand a branch of Honeysuckle all PPr.

 I parted with brother Little and my family on the 16th and  took packet left at 6 o'clock P.M. sailed through the night and landed at  the Breakwater 7 miles North of South Dennis at 5 o'clock in the morning  a distance of 60 miles. Thence by carriage with 7 passengers and the  carriage broke down but I reached Brother Nathaniel Eldridge's house  spent the day and preached there at night.    Next day was Sunday. I met with a large  congregation of the inhabitants of the Cape Saints Captains sailors fishermen  Christian and infidels and preached in the forenoon afternoon and  evening and then held a church meeting until midnight. I organized  a church here with 21 members and appointed Nathaniel Eldridge  Presiding Elder and Horace Humphry and Thomas T. Eldridge his  councillors. I baptized and confirmed one & administered unto  two that were sick.    On the Monday I parted with the Saints  at Cape Cod and returned home where I found my father-in-law  Ezra Carter sen. It was the first time he had ever had an  opportunity of visiting us.    My Father-in-Law Baptized    March the 22nd 1849    When Joseph Smith sen. the First Patriarch of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints laid his hands upon my  head to give me my Patriarchal blessing he said I should  have my father's household standing with me in the  covenant of the Gospel and that I should have power to bring  them into the Kingdom. I afterwards visited my father's  household preached to them the Gospel and baptized my father  ^stepmother^ sister and every member of my father's household and several  other relatives. My wife also whose maiden name  was Phebe W. Carter received a promise that she should  have her father and his household in the new and everlasting 
 Covenant. Her mother was baptized before her death two of her  sisters were in the church her two brothers were now also very  friendly though her brother Ezra had been much opposed till recently  and this day her father Ezra Carter Sen. was baptized and  became a member of the Church. I walked through the  city of Boston with my father-in-law and his grandson  Calvin Foss who was going to California in the ship  Arealus which we visited; and after visiting many parts  of Boston we returned home and held a meeting at my   hired house which I hired.    I opened our family meeting by prayer Bro  Jesse C. Little then addressed us and William Page spoke and  then I arose and addressed my friends for an hour in much  plainness and in the expression of my feelings.    At the close of the meeting I led my  father-in-law Ezra Carter Sen. with two others down into the  sea and baptized them. Mrs Woodruff accompanied her father  to the water and back again and we both felt to rejoice that  the words of the old Patriarch Joseph Smith were fulfilled upon  our heads.    Father Ezra Carter was 76 years and three  days old at the time that I baptized him. He was the son  of Ezra Carter 84 years of age when he died, who was the son  of Daniel Carter who was the son of Ezekiel Carter. The  mother of my wife's father bore the maiden name of Phebe  Whitmore and she was the daughter of Elias Whitmore    Next day Father Carter Calvin Foss  William Page myself and Mrs Woodruff visited Mount Auburn  which is considered one of the most interesting cemetry's in  the world. We next visited Bunker Hill Monument and  Father Carter though 76 years old walked to the top of that  monument 222 feet high. After taking our views  around we returned home. 
 On Sunday the 25th at a Sacrament meeting I confirmed  3 persons one of whom was my wifes father Ezra Carter.    On the 31st I took the train to New York and  preached on the next day Sunday April 1st to the Saints of that city.    I packed up all the New York Heralds and  took with me for the Historian's Office and went by rail and boat on the  4th to Philadelphia.    Some days afterwards I did up a packages and  pamphlets for the Presidency and a full file of the New York Herald  for the Historian Willard Richards.    On the 12th emigrating Saints took passage  in a section boat for Pittsburg 71 in number 50 of whom were  from Philadelphia; and I took boat to Beverly.    Next day I spent several hours on the banks  of the Delaware river watching the fishermen catching fish and in  the afternoon took cars for Beardingtown and walked 5 miles to Caleb  Wright's and was very weary.    In the morning I arose with sore feet and  walked to Jacobstown and to Hornerstown and I ought to have gone  to Armytown. I was sent 4 miles out of the way. The wind  blew so hard I could scarcely walk against it. I carried my carpet  bag and walked 10 miles with blistered toes and weary limbs and I  felt as though I could hardly get to Hornstown Hornerstown. I arrived at  Elder Curtis at at noon weary and lame took dinner and went to  bed. William Smith had visited this region and had drawn  some three or four after him.    After preaching here to the Saints on the  Sunday, I left on the Monday and went 30 miles to Toms River  and several days afterwards returned to Hornerstown again. While  there I baptized and confirmed three persons of Mr Wycalf's  family. They had been believing many years. Joseph  the Twelve and others have visited them. I blessed 4 children  laid hands upon three who were sick and then rode to 
 to Boardentown called upon Sister Fenting and took cars for Newark  New Jersey. I saw an old blind man fall from the cars on to the  track and break his ribs. He suffered much.    I was at Bloomfield on Sunday the 22nd  where I preached baptized and confirmed one ordained one Elder  administered.    On the 23rd I took the rail to New York  where I heard that T.D. Brown from Liverpool had waited a week to  see me. I found him at the hotel opposite Jersey city ferry  and spent several hours with him. He had paid the fare of many  families to Zion who went with Captain Dan Jones and Orson  Spencer and had sent on about 10,000 dollars worth of goods to the  Valley. He was known on the steamship as a Latter-day  Saint and the first officers of the steamer with the mates clerk  purser &c came to see him leave the city for the West.    During the following week I travelled  daily from place to place ranging a distance up from 35 to   75 miles each day met with the Churches and cut off 4 from  the Church for committing adultery.    On the 30 I held a meeting at the  house of Jairus Sandford's and organized the Saints of Fair Haven  into a Branch of the Church over which I appointed and ordained  Sherman Barnes Presiding Elder.    On the 2nd of May I organized  a Branch of the Church at Naugabug and  appointed Samuel Wells Presiding Elder.    I continued travelling from place to  place in the discharge of my ministerial duties and on the 14th  I returned home to my family and spent a little time  in Boston where I saw Brother Cannon and Elder Thomas 
 McKenzie who was packing up a large box of books which he had collected  for the schools in the Valley.    There had been a great mob at New York. The  papers for several days had been full of it. The Boston Daily Times  contained a long article headed: "Dreadful Riot and Bloodshed  at the Astor Place Theatre. The military called out. Firing on  the People. Awful Sacrifice of Life. Twenty one persons killed  thirty three wounded and fifty three of the rioters arrested."    On Thursday night May the 10th 1849 this  mob of 20 thousand had been collected at the above theatre in  consequence of the appearance on the stage of Mr Macready  an English actor.    There had been also a riot of late in Canada  seven thousand mob surrounded the Parliament House broke  in the windows stoned and egg'd the Governor Lord Elgin  and all the members of Parliament burned the Parliament  House to the ground and the Canadian records of five  hundred years destroyed.    On the 16th I went into Boston with Father  Carter Mrs Woofruff and our daughters Phebe and Susan and got our  2y degurrotype likness taken in a group by brother M Cannon  and in the evening I met with Father Carter and my wife Phebe  and conversed with him upon the subject of the Priesthood. I then  laid my hands upon him and ordained him to the office of High  Priest and to the office of a Patriarch in the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. It was fully manifested to me that he  was of the blood of Ephraim and the power of God rested upon us  and we were filled with the spirit of prophecy and rejoicing.    The New York Herald contained an  account of the visit of the Engeneers of the Danoma railroad  Epxpeditions to the people lately dicovered called the Mandingo  Indians at the Mandingo Bay which contains 113 Islands  held in the sole possession of the Mandingo Indians who do 
 shall not permit there the residence of any human beings not of their own tribe and   lineage. They would not as yet communicate to any but their own   tribe any knowledge of their records or history. They live by themselves  some occupying the Islands some the main land but all firmly united  as a band obeying one chief or Old Man (a Patriarch) who is believed   to be endowed by God with all wisdom might and power. Their   government is Patriarchal and the Old Man or Patriachal is   the spiritual adviser as well as chief of all temporal affairs.  He is said to be powerful in mind an body and all his faculties   evergreen. He is acknowledged and regarded as the Vicegerant of   God and all his orders are obeyed and in all cases of sickness or   infirmity they apply to him and whether relief is obtained or not   applicants are contented.    Col. Hughes propounded to the Old Man  the question "upon whom does the office of Old Man descend  at the decease of the present Old Man. The reply was to the   next oldest man of the tribe. "Suppose the successor should   not be endowed with the same qualities of inteligence?" The  reply was that cannot be for when the mantle descends the   Great Spirit imbues that mind with all knowledge.    "Before approaching the entrance of the  Mandingo Bay some 20 miles from land we discovered a fleet  of canoes under sail managed with a skill equal to the best   Waterhall boatmen and on bearing down found them to contain   Mandingo Indians upon a fishing excursion. xxxx The men   are short and stumpy not over 5 feet 6 on the average thick and   square built and capable of enduring great fatigue. Their heads  are remarkably large and round features prominant with all   the physiognomy of the Jew. They have a plurality of   wives according to their means. They permit no communication   with foreigners and a woman so offending is stoned to death  It is a part of their religious creed to keep their races pure  and unadulterated. They profess to have a restorative for 
 the organs of production the effect of which upon one administration will last   for eight years. Our surgeon obtained some of the remedy which has   been pronounced part and parcel of the body of the turtle. A question   arose as to whether this people be not descendants of the lost tribes of   Israel. xxx In trying to get some clue of their early history the   question was asked who lived here 400 or 500 years ago. The reply   was "Tims Father." We asked an old man who looked about 60   years of age how old he was; he replied 121 years."    The foregoing is extracts from the account   which this expidition of Engeneers gave and which is interesting to   the beleiver in the Book of Mormon ^which is^ the History of the aborigines  of America.    It had now been reliably ascertained concerning   the recent great fire at St Louis that 418 buildings had been burned  20 lives lost six million dollars loss of property two thirds of the wholesale   a wise drygoods dealers and one half of the retail and other stores of the city   were burned.    The City of New Orleans was inundated lives   were lost immense property destroyed and danger of the whole city   being washed into the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi breaking   through the levy and running into the city.    On the 2nd of June with Leonard Hardy   I went to Bradford held meetings and returned to Boston on   the 5th.    Fearful accounts of disasters of w^r^ecks fires   inundations cholera wars and revolutions were daily teeming   the newspapers of this date and the gold diggers and their   perils on the plains in their rush to California formed also   much matter for the papers.    On the 16th I arranged my business  to leave home for a season in my mission in the ministry   among the Churches around; and on the 18th I was   at Portland and spent the night at Father Carters. 
 From thence I made a visit to the Islands.  Twelve years before I carried the Gospel to Fox Island and gathered   with me at the close of my mission to the Islands of the Sea about 60  souls ^out^ of about ^a^ hundred which I baptized while there. I now paid   these Islands a visit agains and after staying there several weeks  I started for New Brunswick Canada    Considerable of the distance I walked.  One day after shouldering my carpet bag and walking 7 miles   I waited 3 hours for the Stage to go to St John's and when it   came along it was loaded down and could not take me. Here  I had 42 miles to reach St John's on foot with a heavy travelling  bag and no conveyance with a vast burning forest to go through.    I did not stop to meditate or complain   of my situation but swung my carpet sack over my shoulder and   started on foot in good spirits. Most of the road was through   dense forest rocky and poor soil many parts of the forest was   inhabited by bears and wolves.    After travelling a few ^miles^ I overtook   an Irishman and we walked several miles together when a   man came along in a waggon and carried my bag 5 miles  on before me to Mr McGowings. When I arrived I found   it safe and had a chance to send it on 15 miles farther to   Mr Tilton's. I took dinner with the Irishman we and   left him and I had 15 miles more to walk before I could   stop for the night.    I found the whole forest as I came   along laid waste by the late fires which swept fences  dwellings barns mills lumber yard and everything else in   its march leaving but a few dwellings remaining.    Although I began to be very weary   and lame yet I entered the dark forest before me and I   found my last 15 miles a dreary road indeed. It seemed   as though I could not get through and when I did arrive 
 at Mr Tilton's I was so lame I could scarcely walk at all and I was under  the necessity of going to bed without my supper. I washed myself in cold  water from head to foot to take the soreness out of my cords. I had   walked 35 miles during the day a thing which I had not done before   for 10 years.    After journeying by foot boat and stage we   arrived at the ferry of the Beaubours Island on the 22nd of July where  I left the stage feeling very thankful that my bones were whole and   my life preserved.    I crossed the ferry to the Island walked   one mile through a pleasant grove to the house of Elder Joseph  Russel's.  I found him home and had a happy greeting. I   was thankful to shake hands with a Latter-day Saint after   travelling two weeks without seeing any of the Saints.    I was quite unwell next morning which  was Sunday.    Elder Joseph Russell was located upon   an Island called Beauburs Island situated at the junction  of the two branches of the Miramichis River 7 miles above  Chatham. The Island is 1 1/2 miles in length and half  a mile wide. Brother Russell had owned the whole   of the Island for eleven years during which time he had  built 23 ships upon it with an average tonage of 650  tons each. His location land and improvements   were at a low rate worth $30,000 besides 3 ships on hand. He was   calculating to sell on the 5th of Nov at some price or other settle   his business and go to the Valley.    The Island was a very beautiful and   plesant situation a good location for ship building in the centre   of the river which abounds with salmon mackeral herring chad  and other fish in their season.    Brother Russell was also a Presiding Elder  over a small Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints on
