We fully recognize the fact that from the earliest days in Utah,  the leaders have built factories themselves and have constantly   taught the necessity of sustaining home manufacturers.    Investigation shows that the present condition of affairs makes  vigorous action necessary to overcome the apathy and indifference of  the majority of the people on this subject.    We are working on lines somewhat different from the efforts of the   past, but the object in view is the same.  In order to make our work  effective and thorough, we are anxious to have the advice and assist-  ance of others of influence and experience, and we hope you can give   us a few minutes of your time at an early date.    Very respectfully Yours,  B. F. Grant           H. L. A. Culmer    }   Executive Committee  A.M. Grant

 Cedar City, March 22,nd1894.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother:    Having received a letter from you in  regard to going on a mission: which I deem proper   to answer: For I presume you do not know the   circumstances in which I am placed. Sometime ago   two of the Presidents of my Quorum visited me inquiring   my feelings in regard to this matter. I expressed myself   in this way. If my health would permit I would be willing   to go: but as I told them that I had not seen a healthy   day now for several years years. my impared health has   come through an injure, and during about three years of   this time myself and family was almost entirely kept  by my parents; But the last year or two I have been able   to do a little light work; and have been mostly able to   provide for myself and family. I had no idea at the time   that my name would have been sent up as a missionary or   I might have explained further to them my situation.  I am at present homesteading a quarter section of   land which will have to be proved upon this present year.  Having received your letter I thought it would be my

In reply to yours of the 12th  inst., I am pleased to say that  I feel honored in being called  as a missionary to Holland  and would accept it at once,  were it not for one obstacle  which hinders me from going,  namely the means to pay my  fare to my field of labor.  I notified my Bishop of my  circumstances and applied to  him for help, but on account  of the Ward being in debt  over $600000, he did not feel  justified in promising me the  needed amount. The only source  which is left, is that my oldest  brother has a years tithing on   hand, amounting to about $50.

Salt Lake City, Utah Aug 22, 1894    President W. Woodruff  Dear Brother,    This morning  our valued and much esteemed helper  C. W. Rogers was notified of being chosen  as a missionary to Tahiti.    In behalf of Brother Rogers I desire  to make the following presentation:    He is of course ready to obey the call;  but if he had the least choice, would   prefer Germany for the reason he  has been studying the language for some  time. Moreover his health was not good  when on the Pacific Islands, where he came   from, eight years ago. 
 Spring City Mar. 26 [18]94    President, Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:-    One year ago I recieved  a call to go on a Mission  to Scandinavia, but owing to  my peculiar circumstances at  that time, was compelled  to ask for one year isn wich  to prepare for this Mission  wich was very kindly granted  me.    My one year expire about  the middle of next month.  I am therefor desirous of  meeting this call when my  year is due, and to this 
 Prest Cluff thinks, and I concur, that this should   be answered in the negative. We cannot  do anything about this matter at present,  and they should be set at rest about it.  J.F.S.    [Sideways text] C.H. Mallory  Oct 6 [18]94. [End of sideways text]

I feel thankful to my Heavenly Father  that I am counted worthy to carry the Message  of Salvation to the nations of the earth; and  my joy will be great if only I can be a   humble instrument in the hands of the Lord  in bringing some to the knowledge of and obedi-  ence to the fulness of the Gospel as revealed  through the Prophet Joseph Smith. To this  end I will devote my time, the limited means  I posess, and the ability God shall give me.    I therefore accept with ^pleasure^ and as a blessing  the call to go on this mission; and unless  prevented by some unforeseen event, I will be   at the Historian's Office, S. L.

The  position of each speakers was well  argued, and the arguments, and  scriptural proofs were so well main-  tained by each, that the opinions of the  audiences, were quite largely deci-  ded. many of them expressing them-  selves. that the only way to settle these  important questions to the satisfac-  tion of all parties; would be to bring  about a Joint Discussion by the two  churches. The First Presidency of each  church, selecting Representative men  from each of their respective bodies,  to debate these two important questions  (Sucession + Gathering) before the  people of this city, or any other place  that may be mutually agreed upon.

 perfectly willing to go, but  depending on my own resources  I am totally unable to do  so. I have consulted my   father in regard to the matter   and he feels that if it   is the desire of yourself and  brethern for me to go, that  he will assist me to full-  fil that mission.    If I am accepted  under these circumstances  I am on hand, and will  await your reply as to when  and where I am to go.

 but if he had gone to   my Bishop or any one who  I thought was competant  to recommend, I would  have felt well about it.    However I would like to  hear from you in regard to  this, and perhaps it can  be shown to me in a way  so that I can yet feel  all right about it.    My circumstances are   as follows:  I am an Elder,  am 23 yrs. old, have been  married a little less than  two years, have one child  eleven months old.  I had   no means or property when  married, have worked for wages  ever scince at $3500 per month,  with which we have sustained  ourselves and partly furnished

 Daily Courier March 2st 1894.    Waxes Warm.    EDITOR COURIER: Whereas Messrs.  F. M. Lyman and R. H. Roberts, by   their article in this morning's COURIER,  question the right of ourselves to speak   in behalf of the Reorganized Church of   Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of-  ficially.    This is to certify that we (both of us,)  have been regularly ordained to the   office of elder, in said church, and if nec-  essary can produce our credentials by   showing certificate of appointment from  the general conference to labor as mis-  sionaries in the territory of Arizona  during the year 1892, and also by a   license from said church.  Therefore we  look upon the expressed doubts in the   answer of Messrs. Lyman and Roberts   to be a sort of convenient dodge for the   purpose of trying to avoid a public dis-  cussion with our people.  However we  will notify them by information from  headquarters within a few days.    Respectfully,   D. L. HARRIS,  R. R. DANA.    San Bernardino, March 1, 1894.

Rob-  erts, touching a proposed discussion of  the successorship in the Reorganized  and Utah Mormon churches, also con-  cerning the gathering, are just to hand  and have been noted by the presidency  with careful interest. You are at lib-  erty to propose a discusson of those   subjects with the representative men of  the Utah Mormon church, indorsed by   their presidency; we to reply by repre-  sentative men, chosen and indorsed by  the presidency of the Reorganized  church, such discussion to take place  when and where agreed upon jointly by   the parties in interest, details for the   discussion to be mutually agreed to by   them.    We prefer an early time for said dis-  cussion to occur, and that Salt Lake City  be the place.  Nevertheless, we will   agree upon San Bernardino, Cal., if de-  sired, or to hold it at both points if  agreeable to all parties concerned.    In conclusion, if the Utah Mormon  church by its representative men will  accept the foregoing proposition we  would be pleased to hear from them at  once and have them present their prop-  ositions and details of arrangements  they may desire, to which we will re-  spond at an early time.

Will say so far as my  going on a mission to Scandinavia  would be willing to go had  I the necessary means at  hand. But this I have not  and can see no way at  present of getting the means.  I have been trying to sell my  team to raise the money,  but without success and I have  no other property that I  could reasonably and in justice 
 would have preferred England  as a Field of Labor to that   Indian Terr. if it is  convenient, but this also  is left with you.    Awaiting an early reply  I remain your Brother in  the Gospel.

The call is regular,  and authoritative, and with us,  it is only a question of his willing  [continues upside down] ness, and ability and faith  to go and do the best he can by  the help of the Lord. And if these  are satisfactory, and he desires  to go to Europe, let his mission be changed  to Europe.  J. F. S.
