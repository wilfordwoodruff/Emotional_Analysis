 Daily Courier March 2st 1894.Waxes Warm.EDITOR COURIER: Whereas Messrs.F. M. Lyman and R. H. Roberts, by their article in this morning's COURIER,question the right of ourselves to speak in behalf of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of-ficially.This is to certify that we (both of us,)have been regularly ordained to the office of elder, in said church, and if nec-essary can produce our credentials by showing certificate of appointment fromthe general conference to labor as mis-sionaries in the territory of Arizonaduring the year 1892, and also by a license from said church.  Therefore welook upon the expressed doubts in the answer of Messrs. Lyman and Roberts to be a sort of convenient dodge for the purpose of trying to avoid a public dis-cussion with our people.  However wewill notify them by information fromheadquarters within a few days.Respectfully, D. L. HARRIS,R. R.

Rob-erts, touching a proposed discussion ofthe successorship in the Reorganizedand Utah Mormon churches, also con-cerning the gathering, are just to handand have been noted by the presidencywith careful interest. You are at lib-erty to propose a discusson of those subjects with the representative men ofthe Utah Mormon church, indorsed by their presidency; we to reply by repre-sentative men, chosen and indorsed bythe presidency of the Reorganizedchurch, such discussion to take placewhen and where agreed upon jointly by the parties in interest, details for the discussion to be mutually agreed to by them.We prefer an early time for said dis-cussion to occur, and that Salt Lake Citybe the place.  Nevertheless, we will agree upon San Bernardino, Cal., if de-sired, or to hold it at both points ifagreeable to all parties concerned.In conclusion, if the Utah Mormonchurch by its representative men willaccept the foregoing proposition wewould be pleased to hear from them atonce and have them present their prop-ositions and details of arrangementsthey may desire, to which we will re-spond at an early time.Very truly, etc.,W.
