I told him I- thought he could not have chosen a weaker vessel, as I had not been accustomed to- preaching and I was naturally a little timid in standing before a congregation. president Taylor told me after I was ordained and set apart for my mission my timidity would leave me, and I would fear nothing not even Death itself. he told me I would be greatly endowed with Wisdom and understanding and he felt that I would do much good:; Well (what I wish to relate to you is this,)  I did not obey his counsel but went on my own account to Arizona. to try and make myself a home.  I did not prosper.  so I cam back to Salt Lake City, and I lost my peace of mind and have gone down ever since, nothing I put my hands or mind to do as prospered since that time  the more I have tried to get along in life the more I have been disapointed and bewildered.
