 At the close of the program a brief address was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, who expressed pleasure at being present and re-marked that he felt to congratulate the people that the day had dawned for the enlargement of our borders by the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands. He also congradulated the Hawaiians, who would now be granted a territorial form of government under the Ameri-can flag, and by and by they would re-ceive a state government, with all the sovereign rights and privileges be-longing to the states of the govern-ment. President Woodruff also re-ferred to the published request of President McKinley for prayers in be-half of the army and nation and thanksgiving for victories attained, and hoped that this would be duly ob-served in all the meetings of the Lat-ter-day Saints.

 Mountiain Valley, Aug 24th 1857.Br Willord Woodruff.Dear Sir,I received your favor on the 12th instdated July 1st 1857. you may be assured it was well received it beingthe first I have received from any of the twelve for the last 12 years.I had come to the conclusion that they had become so far advancedin the order of the kingdom and become so popular in temperal thingsthat they had entirely forgotten that such an uncouth old plough goger [goer]as Lyman Wight had an existance on the face of the earth, but I yetlive and am bold to say that of the doctrine of Joseph Smith the Angel of the seventh dispensation there is not a firmer believer ^or defender^ on the face ofthe earth and hold every ordination given me as sacred as I did the daythey ware given, and if the death of Br Joseph gave one of the twelvea supremacy ^over^ the others I have it yet to learn, did Brigham Young haveany authority at Joseph death more than he received from Br JosephIf you answer no I ask whe[n]ce did he receive aurtohority to disanul revela-toions given by Br Joseph? See Book of Doctrine & Covenants p 396 par 7th concerning building the Nauvoo house and by carful examination you willfind that I have a revoelation given to me which is not to end while I live on the earth, and no man on the earth has a right to take thatmission from me being ^given^ of God the highest of all, yet I did consider itmy duty to counsel with the twelve, and the fifties had not circumstancesordered it otherwise the mission I am now on Br Willford I received of the prophet of God, and it was well known by the twelve at that time thatJoseph was striving very hard to come to this very place with 250,000 menhe therefore requested me to come and establish a church in this regionand such a mission was even talked of while in jail where I had the advantage of six months teaching and received many things that is yet unknownto the church, never having refiused to obey the prophet I starteded in all good

 faith, had but just got out of hearing before I was accused from the stand bywho would be big of beging the mission of Br Joseph who to passify me gavehis consent and that I run away from Nauvoo to get rid of fighting and that hecould chase me all over Nauvoo with a plug of tobacco. I acknowlege I am afraidof tobacco but should have no fear of the person for I believe he was to lazy tohave chased me all over Nauvoo, he pitched into me largely on many occationsbut I care very little about the whole. I did not so much wonder at this havingbeen with him for four weeks after the death of Br Joseph and I do not recolectof hearing him use the pronoun we when speaking of the twelve for the first timebut got the pronoun I so comploetely to perpection that I consider^e^d myself outall together. I soon learnt that I was cut off from the church but never learntwhat it was for, after learning this I found I had no where to go but to mybeloved Br Joseph and to the Saviour with the former I have had many com-munications face to face without a dimning vail between, and received manygood instructions this has been to me fully satisfactory, and as I am a litt[l]etimid about meeting men ^with^ such dangerous we^a^pons I have kept one steadycourse doing what I considered my duty according to my ordinations. I willnow proceed to answer your questions according to the best of my recolection, as toMilitary or civil offices I could have had as much as I pleased when I was youngif I had aspired after it therefore I never went higher than corporal, sergent, Cap,and so on, after the county Coldwell was set off I consented to run for Col, of whichI received a unanimous voice, at Nauvoo I receeved 2 commissions one of Brig.Gen, and one of Brevt, Maj. Gen. I have held the office of Chief Justice since I havebeen in Texas in Glaspie County where the other inhabitants ware duble that of the mormons this comprises about all the civil offices of my life.As to church offices I have nentioned two in my journal first an Elderand then a high preaiest. In Jackson Co while the mob was raging tareir downchimbles, tairing open the store there was much said concerning who should goup to Independence and put a stop to the unholy work, and it was agreedthat I should take the lead and go up. I did so with 50 men and put astop to their unohallowed performancces. Br Patredge oberved that I was theman for such a work and put his hands on me and ordained me to stand

 to it, at this time the mob was very busy in unroofing houses in differentbranches, had unroofed 13 in the Whitmer branch and we suposed, was goingto attackedt a branch on the big road we had sent off all of our men exceptBr E Higbee and myself to help that branch, we soon after received a messageenforming us that the mob had taken a tact and ware comeing in on ourbranch, it is true we ware somewhat at a loss to know what to do butto let them come would not do, and we started out to see if we could makeany discoveries of what they was intending to do after traveling about 3/4 of a mile we found they ware on the other side of a cornfield from us, takingsome refreshments I told Br Higbee if he would go round on one side Iwould the other and in joke we would surround them, and if ^he^ heard me fire my gun and hollow come on boys, to do the same at his end of thefield, on hearing this the mob immediately fled, ^hollowing^ we are surrounded andnever come near our branch afterwards, shortly after this I was called uponto go up to Inde^pe^ndence with 200 moen which brought the mob to a compromisebut the next day they ware ten time worse than ever, on this day 60 of themgave ^me^ chase but they droped off till they ware but six to pursue me they run me5 1/4 miles I having distanced them one mile, as for the ditch their horse could notcome it but had to go round, but the greatest miricle of all was my horsedid not either sweat or puff. I have already related the circumstances of myleaving my family in the wilderness and going to Kirtland when I landed there Br Joseph laid his hands on my head and blessed me and ordained me to lead the saint up to Zion even as Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt and said I was of the lineage of Joseph who was sold intoEgypt without amalgamation of blood, [##Exodus 37:27-28##] again while at Father Bosley's in his sugar orchard in 1834 he thare ^blessed and^ ordained ^me^ to the office of Baneemy. Andin the fishing river revelation says Baneemy whom I have appointed, and you will very well recolect at salt river I was ordained to take the commandof the army, and done so till it was disbanded, when I was ordained as co^u^ncilorto the president of the high council and to take the census of the joining Coun-ties, and to say who should return home and who should stay. In Diamon I was ordained a councilor to the Prs of the high council and retained the same in Iowa

 While in Nauvoo I was ordained one of the committee to build the Nauvoo house,one of the twelve, and one of the fifties. Father Smith in my patriarckical blessingpronounced me to be of the lineage of Joseph who was sold into Egypt ^without^ mixtureof blood. Simeon Carter done the same while washing my feet in the house of ^the Lord^Joseph blessed me many times while in jail and prophesied m^u^ch on my headand give me much good instruction which is long to be remembered. This makes a summary of my ordinations, and the revelation that I should continue to preachfor Zion till the Lord should take me to himself. I only ask that I may have the priveiledge of fulfiling them honerably so that I can give an honerable accountto my Saviour and Br Joseph in a coming day. I say had the twelve stood in there place I would have been glad to have cooperated with them butimmediately after receiving those insults from the stand I received a letterfrom the eleven teling me to mind my own business and they wouldmind theirs, which gave me to understand there was now an entire seperation And to show you that I have been obedient to this command. If you should requst any further corespondence I will then comme[n]ce at the date of that letter and give my journal down to the pre^s^ant date.It is so extremely dificult to give any thing like a journal of mylife ^in this hurried maner^ that I should regret very much to have any part of it publisheduntill it can all be published in good order. I know of nothing of anearthly nature that would pleace me any better than to spend six or twelvemonth with my beloved Br Js Wilford Woodruff in preparing my life andjournal together with many geographical skectches for the press, be assuredthose days and hours you speak of have been held as sacred by me as theycould be by you, and I can heartily wish to spend an eternity to gether withthat increasing friendship ^that^ then existed. And as to my ^belief^ in MormonismI have never wavered one hair, but have grown with its grown wit[h] its growthand still preach it with unabated force, and as for my moral character I amread to put it beside those who feel so much beyound me, and as forthe company with me I am willing to have them catechised uponMormonism by your most experenced or adapt critics, and I verily believethey would ^be^ great service to you in this critical hour.

 I cannot help reflecting upon by gone times when I hear of the enemyssurrounding you.When the enemy was prowling around Jackson Co I wasever called upon to take the lead in quelling insurrections and when Barukalecalled upon the strength of the Lords house and 200 men turned out I was orderedto take the command of the same and done so. And again when the mobmilitia infested Far West they sent 35 mile for me in the dead of the nightby this means I was thrown into prison for 6 months which mostly camethrough false sw^e^aring by false Brethren and false letters  writiten by the sameafter all those insults and slanderous conversation I feel so fired with indignationat a mob let them be where they may, I feel as I did then as if I wantedto have a hand in quelling the cursed spirit of mobocracy.I must now come to a close with a thousand things on my mindwhich I would be as glad to communicate as those I have already communicatedwe have had two very dry seasons but have a plenty to eat, to drink andto wear which is all we ask. My family joins with me in sending my best respects to you and yours. Give my respects to Geo. A. Smith; A. Lyman;and C. C.

 P.S. I like to have forgotten your requst concerning Willian E McLellan when the Elders went up to Mo he became convicted under the preaching of David Whitmer and HarveyWhitlock and followed them from one of the middle counties and rarrived in jackson Co a few days afterthey did Hyrum Smith arrived about the same time he convinced and baptized him on the 27th of Aug1837 in a small stream about 10 miles west of Independence. One or two qustions more and I am done, was itnecessary that Br Joseph should be of the lineage of Joseph who was sold into Egypt in order to receivethe Melchezedec priesthood, and rule over the church? Is it necessary that the same Priest-hood should be handed by lineage from father to son? Can the priesthood be transferedto the lineage of Judah? Is it necessary that the lineage of that priesthood should bekept up through all ages of the world to carry out the purposes of God? Can you tellme why I was cut off from the church and such men as Orson, Hide; W. W. Phelps; T. B.Marsh received in, have they ever asked Joseph, Smith; Hyrum, Smith; Sidney, Rigdon or myselfto forgive them for writing letters to the Govenor and sw^e^aring agains[t] us with a view of swearingaway our lives? W. W. Phelps said under oath that he was baptized to save his property.One of Joseph's prophesies in jail was, if he was taken away Brigham Young Cahoon and others would cut me off from the church whether they had any accusation against me or notwhich I have lived to see fulfilled.

 Lyman Wight son of Levi Wight and Sarah Corbon was bonrn the 9th of May 1796 in the township of Fairfield, Herkimer Co, N Y. The commencement of the Wights in the US ware from two brothers emigrating from the Isle of Wightone landed in Mass and the other Virginia. Levi Wight who landed in SalemMass settloed in Leister. The other one we have known ^nothing^ of till within the last half century. I have found quite a number that sprung from that familyduring my travels and preaching sufficient to know that they sprung from the one that landed in Virginia, but like those of the other family ware neververy numerous till within the last falf century. But to return to the one that settled in Leister his family consisted of several girls and boys but he wasso unfortunate as to raise but one of the males his name also was Levi he livedand died in the same place he raised a family of three boys and two girlsthe oldest by the name of Uzial died at sea the second by the name of Caleb went to sea and was never heard of more nor vessel or cargo the thirdwhose name was Levi died in Leister after raising a family of five boysand four girls two of the boys died without families namely Uzial andAbner the other three namely John, Levi, and Caleb raised large familiesLevi was my father he was the first to move ^from^ the township the township where they first commenced settleing he moved in the month of March 1796 tothe state of N Y where I was born I was the seventh child a and the sixthson three brothers unitedly had 26 children and the four girls 46.

 moved 12 miles east into Montgomery County bought a farm and settled and hereI lived till I was 18 years old. There are but ^few^ instances in the early part of my life that would be interesting, my paretns ware very strenuous believers in the Universalian doctrine, strictly moral and perfectly honest, and if I have anyimmorality about me it is not chargable to my parents I was strictly taught to rise above all degridation and never to aspire to any thing that was above myabilities. There is many instances in my life that will be to tegious to come intothis sketch I shall content myself for the preseant by saying that I was kept at a common Country school till I was old enough to help support a numerousfamily after this I continued to go to school some winters till I was sixteenwhich left me with a very limted education but I must ^say^ in honer to myparents that it was not their fault but it was their desire that I should goto school longer, from the time I was old enough I took great interest in attendingmeetings and many times felt seriously affected, but about the time I left school I began to feel as many other youngsters do that the pleasures of this life was about all I should ever get and if I missed of them I should missa good chance I was light minded fond of company and with all quitefond of music and in order to keep up my end with the family and gratifymy feelings and not fall behind in my youthful career I besought my fatherto let me go and work by the month, accordingly in the month of March afterI was sixteen I hired out for six months and worked it out manfully. I nowcommenced a career a sixteenth part of which would be to much for this communicatio[n]In the month of Sep 1813, I hired to a man to take his place in the militiaand go to Sacketts Harbor not being old enough to go for myself for whichI received $30$ a month after being there 14 days I was chosen as one of a guardto escort 236 prisoners to greenbush three miles below Albany and 200 fromSacketts Harbor where we delivered them in good order and returned as faras Utica and ware honerably dismissed I having served just two months to aday received my money and went home in good health and spirits althoughbut 17 years of age I began ^to^ think myself quite a man.

 be spoken at all times it was not known that I was old enough to go for myself till I had hired out for $36 a month and was half way to Sacketts Harboragain. I here served three months received an honerable discharge and got homewith over $100. I now concluded that I was man enough to look out a bettercountry than the one we lived in accordingly in Dec I shouldered my knapsackand traveled westward 170 miles and stoped in Henrietta 6 miles north ofRochester and a prettier or better country I never have seen before or sinceI was gone from home about one year and the extraordinry circumstances ofthis year meeted me about $500. I returned and my father and brothers movedto the same place I was now 20 years old and my father gave me my timeand I went to work here and there and every where, or wherever I could dothe best. In 1819 I went to Upper Canada from there to Mich and back toHenrietta having been gone about one year. In 1823 I marreied a wife namedHarriet Benton daughter of John Benton and Sarah Bradley moved 60miles south into the genesee country and after having two children movedto Warrensville Cuyahoga Co Ohio I resided in this place till 1829 aboutthe month of May when I heard Sidney Rigdon preach what was thencalled the Rigdonite doctrine after hearing him go through the principleof baptism for the remission of sins I went forward and was baptzised by his hands amidst the scorns and derision of several hundred souls andthus became became a bold and fearless defender of the Rigdonite doctrineI should have said up ^to^ this period of my life I had never imbraced any particu-lar tenit of doctrine; my ^wife^ had been a presbyterian and I frequently attended meetingswith her and had my three first children sprinkled but never believeved in any of the religeious creeds of the day in consequence of their not carrying outthe whole doctrine of the Apostles ever believing that it took as much to save a man in one age of the world as an other. In the month of August mywife, John Murdock, and many others ware ^baptized^ by Sidney Rigdon. I now beganto look at the doctrine of the Apostles pretty closely especially that part contained in the second chapter of the ^acts of the^ Apostles where they had all things commonIn consideration of this doctrine I went to Kirtland about 20 mils to seeBr Isaac Morley and Br Billings after some conversation on the subject we

 entered into covenant to make our interests one as anciently. I in conformity to^this^ covenant moved the next Feb to Kirtland into the house with Br Morley wecommenced our labors together in great peace and union, we ware soon joined byeight other families our labors ware united both in farming and mechanismall of which was prosecuted with great vigor we truly began to feel as if theMillenium ^was^ close at hand every thing moved smothly on till about the firstof Nov about this time 5 families concluded to join us in the town of May-field about seven miles up the river they each owning a good farm andmills it was concluded best to establish a branch there accordingly I wasappointed to go and take the charge of the branch when I had my goodsabout half loaded four men came along namely P. P. Pratt; O. Cowdry; P.Whitmer; and Ziba, Peterson; and Brought with them the book of Mormonwhich they wished to interduce to us. I desired them to hold on till I got away as my business was of vital importance and I did not wish tobe troubled with romances nor idle speculators, but nothing daunted theyware not to be put off, but ware as good natured as you please curiositygot uppermost and I concluded to stop for a short time, we called a meeting and one testified that he had seen Angels, and an other therat hehad seen the plates, and that they had seen miracles rought and that the gifts was again in the church, the meeting became so interesting that I did not get away till the sun was about an hour high atnight and it was dark before I arrived at my new home and I amusedmyself by thinking that the trouble was over and that I should notsee them again for a long time supposeing they would start thenext morning for the western boundary of Missouri but in thisI was very much disappointed, but to discribe to you the scenes of the next seven weeks one sceene of which would be as interesting as another would fill quite a large volume. I shall therefore contentmyself by saying that they brought the Book of Mormon tobear upon us and the whole of the common stock family wasbaptized and dureing the seven weeks they tarried they succeeded inbuil[d]ing up a church of 130 members myself and family was baptizedby P. P. Pratt; on the 14th of Nov 1830 in the shagreen river at Kirtland Ohio

 I was confirmed on the 18th and ordained on the 20th by O. Cowdry; my ordintion was a little novel we traveled into the woods a bout falf [half] a mile and placed ourselves behind a large oak tree after a most solemn prayer he intendedto ordain me ^a^ priest but ordained me an elder he after wards told mehe done it in conformity to a vocal voice but in all these matters I confessmy knowlede was very limited indeed, there was but four elders in the whole branch namely Sidney, Rigdon; John, Murdock; Levi, Hancock; and myself;Isaac Morley a priest, the four brethren first spoken of together with F. G. Willams left the same day I was ordaineed for the west Elder Rigdon forthe state of N Y, Elder Murdock for Orange, Elder ^Hancock^ for his place of abodeabout 30 miles off; thus you will see I was left alone with the wholechurch on my hands and the first Elders I saw after this ware from thestate of N Y. In all this I give you but a afew instances out of hundredsI next come to the commencement of my preaching and labors in the churchOn the 21st I made an appointment to preach and filled the same with out any serious difficulty and on the 22nd I was called upon to baptizethree persons namely Ira, Smith; Louisa, Smith; and Benjamin, Crandle;thus performing all the rites and ceremonies of the church with but little further embarrassment, fully believing that I was authorized of our Lordand Savior Jesus Christ, to administer in all the ordinances of init^i^ationinto the church of Jesus Christ, my travels being limited to the borders of Penn, Sandusky river, and the intermediate counties make^ing^ a distance oftwo hundred miles. ^baptized 373, organised 8 churches, ordained 50 elders, many priests, teacchers, & deacons^ On the 4th of June 1831, a conference was held atKirtland ^Ohia^ represented by all the above mamed branches; Joseph Smih our modern Prophet presided; and here I again saw the visible manifestationsof the power of God as plain as could have been on the day of pentecost,and here for the first time I saw the Melchisidec priesthood introducedinto the church of Jesus Christ as anciently; whereunto I was ordained under the hands of Joseph Smith, and I then ordainded Joseph and Sidney and sixteen others such as he chose unto the same priesthood.The spirit of God was made manifest to the heeling of the sick, cast^ing^ outdevils, speaking in unknown tongues, discerning of spirits, and prophesying

 seven months and arived at home on the 14th of July, having filled amost laborious mission traveled 2,650 miles, baptised one hundred personsand brought many others to a kowledge of the truth. Br Elias Higbee accompanied me home from Cincinnati and I baptised him on the 19th of JulyFrom the last mention date I shall make a summary account of my travelsand business proceedings up to the date of June 6th, 1833. I[n] which time I traveledto Clay Co, & back 20 times makeing 600 miles, to Lafayette Co and back 6 timesmaking 400 miles one journey on business for S Gilbert through Clay, Ray,Fayette counties 120 miles. Baptised 33 persons, & in Co with 3 others broke & fenced 40 acres of prairie, planted 23 acres. Had the watch care of a branch of 160 members, in which branch I preached thre times every Sabbath and once every Thursday with the exception of the two Sabbaths and thre Thursdays.During these travels and preachings I bought and sold the following namedproperty as an agent of the agent of the church 80 head of cattle for $500.22000 lb of flour at $2.50 per cwt. ^$550^ 4 hourses $175. Pork 141. Leather $92. Corn $50.Potatoes $75. Store goods $15. Bacon $120. Thus having completed the businessand travels of ten months I find on suming up that I had traveled 1080miles. Baptized 33 persons, preach at least five ^tines^ a week and traded as anagent for the church $1598 and planted a crop by the labor of my ownhands sufficient to have supported my family and an othe as large.From June 6th 1833 to Jan 12th 1834 I was infested with a ruthless mobduring the whole of which time I have a minute historical account during this time I moved my family five miles to the big blue river andopened a new polantation. Met once a week with about 40 or 50 Elders whospoke in different tongues and languages all of which I interpreped fortwo months, having always to be on our lookout for fear the mob wouldbe upon us, and on this account we generally met in the woods in byplaces. The mob continued to commit depredaitions, and outrages upon usuntill the 13th of Nov 1833 such as tariing down the printing office, destroyingbooks, unroofing houses, thrusting rails into the windows, whiping manyin a horible manner, and shooting others. On which day they finishedthe work of driving every mormon about 1200 out of the county.

 Our crops became free booty to their horses, hogs, cattle, &c. I was chasedby about sixty of these ruffians 5 miles (or there was about 60 when theycommeced and dwindl^e^d down to 62.) I fled south and my wife was drivennorth to Clay Co and for three weeks I knew not whether my family wasdead or alive, neither did they know what was my fate, at one timeI was three days without food. When I found my family I found themon the north bank of the Missouri river under a rag carpet tent sort short of food and raiment, in this deploriabl condition on the 27thof Dec my wife bore me a son. And according to the councl of thechurch on the 12th of Jan 1834 I again left my family, my wife witha babe two weeks old and started to Kirtland Ohio and to GeneseeN y a distance of 1300 miles of which I have a daily journal.I filled this mission and returned to my family on the 20th of Juneafter a most laborious and fateiegueing journey of foive months andeight days I was permitted by the kind hand of providence, who hadsustained me through my journeyings, to spend a p[e]aceable night at homewith my family who received me with feelings of gratitude towardstheir Heavenly Father who had so kindly preserved and sustained themunder the adver[s]e circumstances in which they had been left.The result of this mission. The journeyings of the company that wentup to redeem Zion. The p^l^ace that I occupied in that company togetherwith the fishing river revoelation, and breaking out of the cholera.With all these things you are perfectly familiar, as also with my labors inthe church, and on Arthur's house and I therefore pass hastily over themto my next mission. You will recollect after all the jobs on the housewhare finised that in the fall of 1834 you left my house on a missionto Arkansas. The next Dec I moved seven miles east where I bought afarm and spent the time till the 13th of March 1835 in preaching in the church and out, for many miles around haveing been counsiledby Br Joseph to labor in that region of country meeting often incouncil and prepairing things necessary for my family, and after having done all that duty required I started on the above date to the east, and

 New York March 27, 1846.Dear Brother Little.In great haste I sit down to say a fewwords to you before I leave the City. Had a long in-terview with Mr. Benson yesterday and he exceedinglydesires to do business with us he says if he does itfor nothing. I was much pleased with my interviewwith him. He appears to me to be a gentleman. I thinkit will be well to keep upon good terms with him as faras possible. I would like to have Emigration continueas fast as doors are open either by sea or lands. ButI think it right for us to see our way clear in charter-ing ships.—by getting subscriptions among the Saintsfor that purpose before running any risks, that wouldbe detrimental to the course and a disadvantage to theChurch. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Bensonwith my interview with him yesterday. And as far asyou can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere.I would prefer to continue business with him, as heapparently manifests much interest in our welfare. Ihope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly numberout by fall if not before. Bro. Appleby has left thebusiness entirely in regards to chartering a vessel inyour hands and is going out with a company by lands,My respects to Sister Little and all the Saints.I remain your Bro. in the ChurchW.

This company will be formed uponthis basis; take out small dividends and allow the reservedprofits to be used as Capital. There is room for the mulipli-cation of the capital because it will require today 400Factories to supply the United States with sugar, and thiscapital will be used in this direction.I know already of some 8 or 10 places in Nebraska and Iowa who are offering bonuses of from $40,000 to $100,000& in one case $150,000 for a company to erect a Sugar factorywithin their neighborhood. I am prepared to show, as I havealready explained to you that it is possible with proper effortto make each Factory pay 10% and a reserve of one half (at least)of its cash (say $250,000).

The capitalat above estimate would be paid back nine times overin Six years.But supposing only one half of this be realized it isthen as good an investment as can be heard of nowadays. 
 OFFICE OF THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,P. O. BOX 499.Secretary's Department.Salt Lake City, Utah, 18This is no wild scheme, it is perfectly feasible and easy of solution. I had hoped to have been able to carry it out with the homecompany as a nucleus, but I plainly see that I have no oppor-tunity of doing so, therefore am compelled to seek new associationsfor the purpose. I have already secured some capital in thisdirection with the understanding that I be a partner to theextent of one eighth and I have no doubt of securing all I needfrom selected persons. The plan is in perfect line with theprinciple of production and belongs to that branch of financialpower; and its efficacy has already been demonstrated bysuch men as Phil Armour, Rockefeller & many others of theworld's giants who have got hold of the end of a big thing, clungto it, and being satisfied with small dividends at first havemultiplied their capital in the same line of business.Will you kindly give me an interview on this subject at your early convenience, today if possible.Very respectfullyArthur Stayner

Our Temple in this City is approach-ing such stages in the course of completionthat suggests the necessity of providing means for heating and lighting, that will be suitablefor such an edifice as a Temple; and if modernmethods are adopted there will be a largeamount of work required to be done, and whenthe word is completed.

 Substance of contents of accompanying letter:I write for information regarding your colony. I wish to come to yourplace. I have still some fortune in Germany, consisting of a house and farmingland, also three children. The children say they will come to this country. I have read in the newspapers that you have agents in Switzerland, and thought per-haps you had one in Alsaice. If you have I wish you would have him attend to my business there, and meet my children and explain to them. If you will do this Iwill send you authority to act for me; and if I receive any mony from them then Iwill come to your country. I have already received some information from a memberof your church by the name of James Myer Hill. What he told me I have long thoughtto be true, and I have already experienced that it was true. A great many familieshere have only one or two children, and they think by so doing they are doing rightbut they have no luck either in their increase or their life. Goes on to relatethat a pastor there had one son; ^the pastor^ took sick and died suddenly; his wife after along sickness also died; the son became crazy and was put in an asylum; he after-wards came out, married a French lady, moved to France; she got the fortune andleft him pennyless. He asks for information concerning church doctrines, and howto get here. Encloses stamps and requests immediate answer - he is evidently in a hurry.

 MR. SMITH'S "REVELATION."THE new declaration of Mormon faithadopted at the recent conference of the Elders at Salt Lake City is, with the ex-ception of the article expressing obedienceto the law, identical with the originaldeclaration drawn up and promulgated in1842 by JOSEPH SMITH, the founder of thesect. It therefore — although the Eldersmay not be aware of the fact — affords anopportunity of an early test of the genuine-ness of one at least of the Divine revela-tions which SMITH claimed to have re-cieved. Both declarations contain thefollowing article: "We believe in the " literal gathering of Israel and in the " restoration of the ten tribes; that Zion" will be built upon this continent; that" CHRIST will reign personally upon the" earth, and that the earth will be renewed" and receive its Paradisiacal glory."Now, in his "Autobiography," SMITH toldhis followers that it had been revealed tohim when the second coming of CHRISTwould take place. He did so in the fol-lowing passage: "I was once praying" very earnestly to know the time of the" coming of the Son of Man when I heard" a voice repeat the following: 'JOSEPH," ' my son, it thou livest until thou art" ' eighty-five years old, thou shalt see" ' the face of the Son of Man; there-" ' fore, let this suffice, and trouble me" ' no more in this matter,'" As JOSEPHwas born on December 23, 1805, this "re-"velation" fixes as the same date of thepresent year as the time of the secondcoming. On that day, then, the honestyof the founder of Mormonism willbe put to the test. Should the"revelation" prove to have beenincorrect it will, of course, be open to the present head of the Church to assert thathe also has had one explaining the diffi-culty in a satisfactory manner, just as hehas had one authorizing him to throwpolygamy overboard at a time when itsretention had become embarrassing andwas likely to prove disastrous to the Church. But this will not do. Eitherthe "revelation" made to JOSEPH SMITHis true or it is not. If on December 23next we find that it is not, there will beeven more reason than ever to believe the founder of Mormonism to have been a rank imposter. As it is, no one outsideof the Mormons themselves believes other-wise of him, bit it will be satisfactory tohave even at this late day a new proof ofhis imposture.EDITORIAL NOTES.Mr. Hesson, M. P., who has just returnedfrom a visit to the North-West and BritishColumbia, reports that the Calgary exhi-bition, the experiment farms at Brandon,and several other places, he saw samples of two-rowed barley equal, if not superior, toany he had ever seen. The grain, he says,was firm, bright, solid, and perfectly healthy.If it be true, as Mr. Hesson maintains, thatthe North-West can produce barley that will suit the English market, the news is satis-
