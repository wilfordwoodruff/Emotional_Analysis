Rexburg, Idaho Feb. 23 1898    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City   Utah    Dear Brother,    Replying to your favor of  19th inst. in the matter of Elders   Conrad Walz and Fred Pfort. We have  seen the brethren and have made the   following arrangements. Brother Walz  will go on time set viz. 23 April and  Brother Pfort says he will be ready   to go October 15. Hoping this will  be satisfactory    Your Brother in the Gospel  T E Ricks 
 At the close of the program a brief   address was delivered by President   Wilford Woodruff, who expressed   pleasure at being present and re-  marked that he felt to congratulate the   people that the day had dawned for   the enlargement of our borders by the   annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.   He also congradulated the Hawaiians,   who would now be granted a territorial   form of government under the Ameri-  can flag, and by and by they would re-  ceive a state government, with all the   sovereign rights and privileges be-  longing to the states of the govern-  ment. President Woodruff also re-  ferred to the published request of   President McKinley for prayers in be-  half of the army and nation and   thanksgiving for victories attained,   and hoped that this would be duly ob-  served in all the meetings of the Lat-  ter-day Saints.

Bannock Stake  OF THE  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,    Rexburg, Idaho Mar 30th 1898    Pres Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:    Some time ago Bro Chas  Pettel's name was suggested to us and recommended  to you as worthy and ready to go upon a mission in  mMay next.  In consultation with Bro M. F. Cowley  while here a few weeks ago, he was advised to make  preparations to this end as he undoubtedly would  receive a call from you.  He has done so and if it  meets your approval he is ready to leave here on  Monday next so as to get the benefits of cheap  Railroad rates, spend a few weeks in Salt Lake  City and be ready to start as first suggested.    Your immediate reply would be much  appreciated by him    Very Respectfully yours.  T. E. Ricks

The young  lady at whose letter you enclosed  I think is only about 17 years old  and unmarried, and I think it would  be unwise to send her on a  mission at this time. She has  no means to help herself with  I fear, and her parents are in  no way able to help her. Girls  of her age can hardly appreciate  what a mission to the world  means and I cannot think it  the proper thing to do in this  case.    With kind regards  Your Bro  Orson Smith

 Mountiain Valley, Aug 24th 1857.    Br Willord Woodruff.    Dear Sir,    I received your favor on the 12th inst  dated July 1st 1857. you may be assured it was well received it being  the first I have received from any of the twelve for the last 12 years.  I had come to the conclusion that they had become so far advanced  in the order of the kingdom and become so popular in temperal things  that they had entirely forgotten that such an uncouth old plough goger [goer]  as Lyman Wight had an existance on the face of the earth, but I yet  live and am bold to say that of the doctrine of Joseph Smith the Angel   of the seventh dispensation there is not a firmer believer ^or defender^ on the face of  the earth and hold every ordination given me as sacred as I did the day  they ware given, and if the death of Br Joseph gave one of the twelve  a supremacy ^over^ the others I have it yet to learn, did Brigham Young have  any authority at Joseph death more than he received from Br Joseph  If you answer no I ask whe[n]ce did he receive aurtohority to disanul revela-  toions given by Br Joseph? See Book of Doctrine & Covenants p 396 par 7th   concerning building the Nauvoo house and by carful examination you will  find that I have a revoelation given to me which is not to end while   I live on the earth, and no man on the earth has a right to take that  mission from me being ^given^ of God the highest of all, yet I did consider it  my duty to counsel with the twelve, and the fifties had not circumstances  ordered it otherwise the mission I am now on Br Willford I received of the   prophet of God, and it was well known by the twelve at that time that  Joseph was striving very hard to come to this very place with 250,000 men  he therefore requested me to come and establish a church in this region  and such a mission was even talked of while in jail where I had the   advantage of six months teaching and received many things that is yet unknown  to the church, never having refiused to obey the prophet I starteded in all good

 faith, had but just got out of hearing before I was accused from the stand by  who would be big of beging the mission of Br Joseph who to passify me gave  his consent and that I run away from Nauvoo to get rid of fighting and that he  could chase me all over Nauvoo with a plug of tobacco. I acknowlege I am afraid  of tobacco but should have no fear of the person for I believe he was to lazy to  have chased me all over Nauvoo, he pitched into me largely on many occations  but I care very little about the whole. I did not so much wonder at this having  been with him for four weeks after the death of Br Joseph and I do not recolect  of hearing him use the pronoun we when speaking of the twelve for the first time  but got the pronoun I so comploetely to perpection that I consider^e^d myself out  all together. I soon learnt that I was cut off from the church but never learnt  what it was for, after learning this I found I had no where to go but to my  beloved Br Joseph and to the Saviour with the former I have had many com-  munications face to face without a dimning vail between, and received many  good instructions this has been to me fully satisfactory, and as I am a litt[l]e  timid about meeting men ^with^ such dangerous we^a^pons I have kept one steady  course doing what I considered my duty according to my ordinations. I will  now proceed to answer your questions according to the best of my recolection, as to  Military or civil offices I could have had as much as I pleased when I was young  if I had aspired after it therefore I never went higher than corporal, sergent, Cap,  and so on, after the county Coldwell was set off I consented to run for Col, of which  I received a unanimous voice, at Nauvoo I receeved 2 commissions one of Brig.  Gen, and one of Brevt, Maj. Gen. I have held the office of Chief Justice since I have  been in Texas in Glaspie County where the other inhabitants ware duble that of   the mormons this comprises about all the civil offices of my life.    As to church offices I have nentioned two in my journal first an Elder  and then a high preaiest. In Jackson Co while the mob was raging tareir down  chimbles, tairing open the store there was much said concerning who should go  up to Independence and put a stop to the unholy work, and it was agreed  that I should take the lead and go up. I did so with 50 men and put a  stop to their unohallowed performancces. Br Patredge oberved that I was the  man for such a work and put his hands on me and ordained me to stand

Do you know of others Elsewhere?    A collection of, PICTURES of such are being  collected for Historical purposes—not  for sale—or for gain—but to be placed  on Exhibition at the Worlds Fair in 1892.    Please let me know whether such  exist wish you—if such as formerly belonged   to the noted men who first braved  the unknown could be copied—it would  add interest to the Collection & preserve the  history of the original maker and owner also.    Only such as are engraved would be  of service.    Please Answer & oblige    Rufus A. Grider  of the Mohawk Hist Society at  Canajoharie N. Y.

In reply to same I beg to state that I accept of the   call believing that it is the greatest honor that could  be conferred upon me.  Therefore I will be prepared to leave  this city upon the day metioned, namely the 24th of April 1897  Hopeing that the Spirit of my Mission will rest  upon me, I remain Your Brother in the Gospel    Thomas C.

 to it, at this time the mob was very busy in unroofing houses in different  branches, had unroofed 13 in the Whitmer branch and we suposed, was going  to attackedt a branch on the big road we had sent off all of our men except  Br E Higbee and myself to help that branch, we soon after received a message  enforming us that the mob had taken a tact and ware comeing in on our  branch, it is true we ware somewhat at a loss to know what to do but  to let them come would not do, and we started out to see if we could make  any discoveries of what they was intending to do after traveling about 3/4 of a   mile we found they ware on the other side of a cornfield from us, taking  some refreshments I told Br Higbee if he would go round on one side I  would the other and in joke we would surround them, and if ^he^ heard me   fire my gun and hollow come on boys, to do the same at his end of the  field, on hearing this the mob immediately fled, ^hollowing^ we are surrounded and  never come near our branch afterwards, shortly after this I was called upon  to go up to Inde^pe^ndence with 200 moen which brought the mob to a compromise  but the next day they ware ten time worse than ever, on this day 60 of them  gave ^me^ chase but they droped off till they ware but six to pursue me they run me  5 1/4 miles I having distanced them one mile, as for the ditch their horse could not  come it but had to go round, but the greatest miricle of all was my horse  did not either sweat or puff. I have already related the circumstances of my  leaving my family in the wilderness and going to Kirtland when I landed   there Br Joseph laid his hands on my head and blessed me and ordained   me to lead the saint up to Zion even as Moses led the children of Israel   out of Egypt and said I was of the lineage of Joseph who was sold into  Egypt without amalgamation of blood, [##Exodus 37:27-28##] again while at Father Bosley's in   his sugar orchard in 1834 he thare ^blessed and^ ordained ^me^ to the office of Baneemy. And  in the fishing river revelation says Baneemy whom I have appointed, and   you will very well recolect at salt river I was ordained to take the command  of the army, and done so till it was disbanded, when I was ordained as co^u^ncilor  to the president of the high council and to take the census of the joining Coun-  ties, and to say who should return home and who should stay. In Diamon I was   ordained a councilor to the Prs of the high council and retained the same in Iowa

 While in Nauvoo I was ordained one of the committee to build the Nauvoo house,  one of the twelve, and one of the fifties. Father Smith in my patriarckical blessing  pronounced me to be of the lineage of Joseph who was sold into Egypt ^without^ mixture  of blood. Simeon Carter done the same while washing my feet in the house of ^the Lord^  Joseph blessed me many times while in jail and prophesied m^u^ch on my head  and give me much good instruction which is long to be remembered. This makes   a summary of my ordinations, and the revelation that I should continue to preach  for Zion till the Lord should take me to himself. I only ask that I may have   the priveiledge of fulfiling them honerably so that I can give an honerable account  to my Saviour and Br Joseph in a coming day. I say had the twelve stood in   there place I would have been glad to have cooperated with them but  immediately after receiving those insults from the stand I received a letter  from the eleven teling me to mind my own business and they would  mind theirs, which gave me to understand there was now an entire seperation   And to show you that I have been obedient to this command. If you   should requst any further corespondence I will then comme[n]ce at the   date of that letter and give my journal down to the pre^s^ant date.    It is so extremely dificult to give any thing like a journal of my  life ^in this hurried maner^ that I should regret very much to have any part of it published  untill it can all be published in good order. I know of nothing of an  earthly nature that would pleace me any better than to spend six or twelve  month with my beloved Br Js Wilford Woodruff in preparing my life and  journal together with many geographical skectches for the press, be assured  those days and hours you speak of have been held as sacred by me as they  could be by you, and I can heartily wish to spend an eternity to gether with  that increasing friendship ^that^ then existed. And as to my ^belief^ in Mormonism  I have never wavered one hair, but have grown with its grown wit[h] its growth  and still preach it with unabated force, and as for my moral character I am  read to put it beside those who feel so much beyound me, and as for  the company with me I am willing to have them catechised upon  Mormonism by your most experenced or adapt critics, and I verily believe  they would ^be^ great service to you in this critical hour.

 I cannot help reflecting upon by gone times when I hear of the enemys  surrounding you.    When the enemy was prowling around Jackson Co I was  ever called upon to take the lead in quelling insurrections and when Barukale  called upon the strength of the Lords house and 200 men turned out I was ordered  to take the command of the same and done so. And again when the mob  militia infested Far West they sent 35 mile for me in the dead of the night  by this means I was thrown into prison for 6 months which mostly came  through false sw^e^aring by false Brethren and false letters  writiten by the same  after all those insults and slanderous conversation I feel so fired with indignation  at a mob let them be where they may, I feel as I did then as if I wanted  to have a hand in quelling the cursed spirit of mobocracy.    I must now come to a close with a thousand things on my mind  which I would be as glad to communicate as those I have already communicated  we have had two very dry seasons but have a plenty to eat, to drink and  to wear which is all we ask. My family joins with me in sending my   best respects to you and yours. Give my respects to Geo. A. Smith; A. Lyman;  and C. C. Rich; and all others who enquire after such a mortal as I am.

 P.S. I like to have forgotten your requst concerning Willian E McLellan when   the Elders went up to Mo he became convicted under the preaching of David Whitmer and Harvey  Whitlock and followed them from one of the middle counties and rarrived in jackson Co a few days after  they did Hyrum Smith arrived about the same time he convinced and baptized him on the 27th of Aug  1837 in a small stream about 10 miles west of Independence. One or two qustions more and I am done, was it  necessary that Br Joseph should be of the lineage of Joseph who was sold into Egypt in order to receive  the Melchezedec priesthood, and rule over the church? Is it necessary that the same Priest-  hood should be handed by lineage from father to son? Can the priesthood be transfered  to the lineage of Judah? Is it necessary that the lineage of that priesthood should be  kept up through all ages of the world to carry out the purposes of God? Can you tell  me why I was cut off from the church and such men as Orson, Hide; W. W. Phelps; T. B.  Marsh received in, have they ever asked Joseph, Smith; Hyrum, Smith; Sidney, Rigdon or myself  to forgive them for writing letters to the Govenor and sw^e^aring agains[t] us with a view of swearing  away our lives? W. W. Phelps said under oath that he was baptized to save his property.  One of Joseph's prophesies in jail was, if he was taken away Brigham Young Cahoon and   others would cut me off from the church whether they had any accusation against me or not  which I have lived to see fulfilled. I have written you a short sketch of my life consisting  of 12 pages the first 4 p[ages] will be sent in the envelop with this letter the   other 8 p[ages] in an other envelop    L Wight

 Lyman Wight son of Levi Wight and Sarah Corbon was bonrn the 9th of   May 1796 in the township of Fairfield, Herkimer Co, N Y. The commencement   of the Wights in the US ware from two brothers emigrating from the Isle of Wight  one landed in Mass and the other Virginia. Levi Wight who landed in Salem  Mass settloed in Leister. The other one we have known ^nothing^ of till within the   last half century. I have found quite a number that sprung from that family  during my travels and preaching sufficient to know that they sprung from   the one that landed in Virginia, but like those of the other family ware never  very numerous till within the last falf century. But to return to the one that   settled in Leister his family consisted of several girls and boys but he was  so unfortunate as to raise but one of the males his name also was Levi he lived  and died in the same place he raised a family of three boys and two girls  the oldest by the name of Uzial died at sea the second by the name of   Caleb went to sea and was never heard of more nor vessel or cargo the third  whose name was Levi died in Leister after raising a family of five boys  and four girls two of the boys died without families namely Uzial and  Abner the other three namely John, Levi, and Caleb raised large families  Levi was my father he was the first to move ^from^ the township the township   where they first commenced settleing he moved in the month of March 1796 to  the state of N Y where I was born I was the seventh child a and the sixth  son three brothers unitedly had 26 children and the four girls 46. In a few years   after my father moved, his brothers and sisters all followed and their descendants  are scattered over the western world. My aquantance with my ancesters on  my Mothers side is very limited indeed I know nothing further than that  my Mother's father name was Jabes Corbon his wifes name was Sarah Ab^b^ot  they had but two children my Mother and a brother older; their father died  when they was quite young their Mother married a man by the name Chapman  of whom I know nothing except that they had no children the two ware raised   as orphans in Mudy Brook Parish Ct joining Mass there ware four children  in my father's family younger than myself I was six years old when my father

 moved 12 miles east into Montgomery County bought a farm and settled and here  I lived till I was 18 years old. There are but ^few^ instances in the early part of my   life that would be interesting, my paretns ware very strenuous believers in the   Universalian doctrine, strictly moral and perfectly honest, and if I have any  immorality about me it is not chargable to my parents I was strictly taught   to rise above all degridation and never to aspire to any thing that was above my  abilities. There is many instances in my life that will be to tegious to come into  this sketch I shall content myself for the preseant by saying that I was kept at   a common Country school till I was old enough to help support a numerous  family after this I continued to go to school some winters till I was sixteen  which left me with a very limted education but I must ^say^ in honer to my  parents that it was not their fault but it was their desire that I should go  to school longer, from the time I was old enough I took great interest in attending  meetings and many times felt seriously affected, but about the time I left   school I began to feel as many other youngsters do that the pleasures of this   life was about all I should ever get and if I missed of them I should miss  a good chance I was light minded fond of company and with all quite  fond of music and in order to keep up my end with the family and gratify  my feelings and not fall behind in my youthful career I besought my father  to let me go and work by the month, accordingly in the month of March after  I was sixteen I hired out for six months and worked it out manfully. I now  commenced a career a sixteenth part of which would be to much for this communicatio[n]  In the month of Sep 1813, I hired to a man to take his place in the militia  and go to Sacketts Harbor not being old enough to go for myself for which  I received $30$ a month after being there 14 days I was chosen as one of a guard  to escort 236 prisoners to greenbush three miles below Albany and 200 from  Sacketts Harbor where we delivered them in good order and returned as far  as Utica and ware honerably dismissed I having served just two months to a  day received my money and went home in good health and spirits although  but 17 years of age I began ^to^ think myself quite a man. I shall not mention  any particulars that transpired from this till the next Sep, although at this  time I was old enough to have went for myself yet as the truth is not to

 be spoken at all times it was not known that I was old enough to go for my  self till I had hired out for $36 a month and was half way to Sacketts Harbor  again. I here served three months received an honerable discharge and got home  with over $100. I now concluded that I was man enough to look out a better  country than the one we lived in accordingly in Dec I shouldered my knapsack  and traveled westward 170 miles and stoped in Henrietta 6 miles north of  Rochester and a prettier or better country I never have seen before or since  I was gone from home about one year and the extraordinry circumstances of  this year meeted me about $500. I returned and my father and brothers moved  to the same place I was now 20 years old and my father gave me my time  and I went to work here and there and every where, or wherever I could do  the best. In 1819 I went to Upper Canada from there to Mich and back to  Henrietta having been gone about one year. In 1823 I marreied a wife named  Harriet Benton daughter of John Benton and Sarah Bradley moved 60  miles south into the genesee country and after having two children moved  to Warrensville Cuyahoga Co Ohio I resided in this place till 1829 about  the month of May when I heard Sidney Rigdon preach what was then  called the Rigdonite doctrine after hearing him go through the principle  of baptism for the remission of sins I went forward and was baptzised by   his hands amidst the scorns and derision of several hundred souls and  thus became became a bold and fearless defender of the Rigdonite doctrine  I should have said up ^to^ this period of my life I had never imbraced any particu-  lar tenit of doctrine; my ^wife^ had been a presbyterian and I frequently attended meetings  with her and had my three first children sprinkled but never believeved in   any of the religeious creeds of the day in consequence of their not carrying out  the whole doctrine of the Apostles ever believing that it took as much to save   a man in one age of the world as an other. In the month of August my  wife, John Murdock, and many others ware ^baptized^ by Sidney Rigdon. I now began  to look at the doctrine of the Apostles pretty closely especially that part contain  ed in the second chapter of the ^acts of the^ Apostles where they had all things common  In consideration of this doctrine I went to Kirtland about 20 mils to see  Br Isaac Morley and Br Billings after some conversation on the subject we

 entered into covenant to make our interests one as anciently. I in conformity to  ^this^ covenant moved the next Feb to Kirtland into the house with Br Morley we  commenced our labors together in great peace and union, we ware soon joined by  eight other families our labors ware united both in farming and mechanism  all of which was prosecuted with great vigor we truly began to feel as if the  Millenium ^was^ close at hand every thing moved smothly on till about the first  of Nov about this time 5 families concluded to join us in the town of May-  field about seven miles up the river they each owning a good farm and  mills it was concluded best to establish a branch there accordingly I was  appointed to go and take the charge of the branch when I had my goods  about half loaded four men came along namely P. P. Pratt; O. Cowdry; P.  Whitmer; and Ziba, Peterson; and Brought with them the book of Mormon  which they wished to interduce to us. I desired them to hold on till I   got away as my business was of vital importance and I did not wish to  be troubled with romances nor idle speculators, but nothing daunted they  ware not to be put off, but ware as good natured as you please curiosity  got uppermost and I concluded to stop for a short time, we called a   meeting and one testified that he had seen Angels, and an other therat he  had seen the plates, and that they had seen miracles rought and that   the gifts was again in the church, the meeting became so interesting   that I did not get away till the sun was about an hour high at  night and it was dark before I arrived at my new home and I amused  myself by thinking that the trouble was over and that I should not  see them again for a long time supposeing they would start the  next morning for the western boundary of Missouri but in this  I was very much disappointed, but to discribe to you the scenes of the   next seven weeks one sceene of which would be as interesting as an  other would fill quite a large volume. I shall therefore content  myself by saying that they brought the Book of Mormon to  bear upon us and the whole of the common stock family was  baptized and dureing the seven weeks they tarried they succeeded in  buil[d]ing up a church of 130 members myself and family was baptized  by P. P. Pratt; on the 14th of Nov 1830 in the shagreen river at Kirtland Ohio

 I was confirmed on the 18th and ordained on the 20th by O. Cowdry; my ordintion   was a little novel we traveled into the woods a bout falf [half] a mile and placed   ourselves behind a large oak tree after a most solemn prayer he intended  to ordain me ^a^ priest but ordained me an elder he after wards told me  he done it in conformity to a vocal voice but in all these matters I confess  my knowlede was very limited indeed, there was but four elders in the whole   branch namely Sidney, Rigdon; John, Murdock; Levi, Hancock; and myself;  Isaac Morley a priest, the four brethren first spoken of together with F. G.   Willams left the same day I was ordaineed for the west Elder Rigdon for  the state of N Y, Elder Murdock for Orange, Elder ^Hancock^ for his place of abode  about 30 miles off; thus you will see I was left alone with the whole  church on my hands and the first Elders I saw after this ware from the  state of N Y. In all this I give you but a afew instances out of hundreds  I next come to the commencement of my preaching and labors in the church  On the 21st I made an appointment to preach and filled the same with   out any serious difficulty and on the 22nd I was called upon to baptize  three persons namely Ira, Smith; Louisa, Smith; and Benjamin, Crandle;  thus performing all the rites and ceremonies of the church with but little   further embarrassment, fully believing that I was authorized of our Lord  and Savior Jesus Christ, to administer in all the ordinances of init^i^ation  into the church of Jesus Christ, my travels being limited to the borders   of Penn, Sandusky river, and the intermediate counties make^ing^ a distance of  two hundred miles. ^baptized 373, organised 8 churches, ordained 50 elders, many priests, teacchers, & deacons^ On the 4th of June 1831, a conference was held at  Kirtland ^Ohia^ represented by all the above mamed branches; Joseph Smih our   modern Prophet presided; and here I again saw the visible manifestations  of the power of God as plain as could have been on the day of pentecost,  and here for the first time I saw the Melchisidec priesthood introduced  into the church of Jesus Christ as anciently; whereunto I was ordained   under the hands of Joseph Smith, and I then ordainded Joseph and   Sidney and sixteen others such as he chose unto the same priesthood.  The spirit of God was made manifest to the heeling of the sick, cast^ing^ out  devils, speaking in unknown tongues, discerning of spirits, and prophesying

 seven months and arived at home on the 14th of July, having filled a  most laborious mission traveled 2,650 miles, baptised one hundred persons  and brought many others to a kowledge of the truth. Br Elias Higbee accom  panied me home from Cincinnati and I baptised him on the 19th of July    From the last mention date I shall make a summary account of my travels  and business proceedings up to the date of June 6th, 1833. I[n] which time I traveled  to Clay Co, & back 20 times makeing 600 miles, to Lafayette Co and back 6 times  making 400 miles one journey on business for S Gilbert through Clay, Ray,  Fayette counties 120 miles. Baptised 33 persons, & in Co with 3 others broke   & fenced 40 acres of prairie, planted 23 acres. Had the watch care of a branch   of 160 members, in which branch I preached thre times every Sabbath and   once every Thursday with the exception of the two Sabbaths and thre Thursdays.    During these travels and preachings I bought and sold the following named  property as an agent of the agent of the church 80 head of cattle for $500.  22000 lb of flour at $2.50 per cwt. ^$550^ 4 hourses $175. Pork 141. Leather $92. Corn $50.  Potatoes $75. Store goods $15. Bacon $120. Thus having completed the business  and travels of ten months I find on suming up that I had traveled 1080  miles. Baptized 33 persons, preach at least five ^tines^ a week and traded as an  agent for the church $1598 and planted a crop by the labor of my own  hands sufficient to have supported my family and an othe as large.    From June 6th 1833 to Jan 12th 1834 I was infested with a ruthless mob  during the whole of which time I have a minute historical account   during this time I moved my family five miles to the big blue river and  opened a new polantation. Met once a week with about 40 or 50 Elders who  spoke in different tongues and languages all of which I interpreped for  two months, having always to be on our lookout for fear the mob would  be upon us, and on this account we generally met in the woods in by  places. The mob continued to commit depredaitions, and outrages upon us  untill the 13th of Nov 1833 such as tariing down the printing office, destroying  books, unroofing houses, thrusting rails into the windows, whiping many  in a horible manner, and shooting others. On which day they finished  the work of driving every mormon about 1200 out of the county.

 Our crops became free booty to their horses, hogs, cattle, &c. I was chased  by about sixty of these ruffians 5 miles (or there was about 60 when they  commeced and dwindl^e^d down to 62.) I fled south and my wife was driven  north to Clay Co and for three weeks I knew not whether my family was  dead or alive, neither did they know what was my fate, at one time  I was three days without food. When I found my family I found them  on the north bank of the Missouri river under a rag carpet tent sort   short of food and raiment, in this deploriabl condition on the 27th  of Dec my wife bore me a son. And according to the councl of the  church on the 12th of Jan 1834 I again left my family, my wife with  a babe two weeks old and started to Kirtland Ohio and to Genesee  N y a distance of 1300 miles of which I have a daily journal.    I filled this mission and returned to my family on the 20th of June  after a most laborious and fateiegueing journey of foive months and  eight days I was permitted by the kind hand of providence, who had  sustained me through my journeyings, to spend a p[e]aceable night at home  with my family who received me with feelings of gratitude towards  their Heavenly Father who had so kindly preserved and sustained them  under the adver[s]e circumstances in which they had been left.    The result of this mission. The journeyings of the company that went  up to redeem Zion. The p^l^ace that I occupied in that company together  with the fishing river revoelation, and breaking out of the cholera.  With all these things you are perfectly familiar, as also with my labors in  the church, and on Arthur's house and I therefore pass hastily over them  to my next mission. You will recollect after all the jobs on the house  whare finised that in the fall of 1834 you left my house on a mission  to Arkansas. The next Dec I moved seven miles east where I bought a  farm and spent the time till the 13th of March 1835 in preaching in   the church and out, for many miles around haveing been counsiled  by Br Joseph to labor in that region of country meeting often in  council and prepairing things necessary for my family, and after having   done all that duty required I started on the above date to the east, and

Up to this date I have kept  a daily journal from my first labors in the minsistry, together will all  the most imporant acts; and it is utterly impossible to give you a  satisfactory sketch, all the most touching incident of my life are couch  in history of some length. During the six months I was in jail I combined   my daily journal into a daily history covering thirty sheets of paper.  We are now in the hands of our enemis, and I will give you short sketches  till we get out, or rather refer you to the Times & Seasons Vol 4, No 17,  p[age] 263 to 269th.

 me of doing any bisiness untill Sep 2nd from this time to Jan 7th 1841 I confined  myself to preaching in, and around Augusta, built up a branch of between  60 and 70 members in that place, and had equal success in the regions around  there. On the above date I started to visit the first Presidency with a view of   going to K. Y. But he appointed me one of the committee to build the Na^u^voo  house, and advised me to preach in Iowa till the Apr conference. We had a  glor^i^ous conference. And from that time to the 27th of May I built a boat  and furnished the Nauvoo house with 500 bushels of meal, and 35 barels of  flour deliverd in Nauvoo. And on that day started to the southern part  of Ill, traveled through all the churches from Jackson Co to Nauvoo where   I arrived on the 17th of July with 70 head of cattle, $200 in noney and sold  several shares for other property. from this to the 19th I ^was^ busilyy in fixing for the   Nauvoo house. On which day (without visiting my family) I started again and   traveled extensively through all the different branches and returned to  Nauvoo Sep 2nd with 60, or 70 head of horses and cattle and much other prop-  erty for building the Nauvoo house. And $85 in money for the temple. From  this to the 15th I was buissily engaged in making preperations ^for^ of an other  journey, on which I started on the above date and vis^ited^ the branches for about  100 miles and returned home to Nauvoo. (I had previously moved my family to   Nauvoo) on the 30th of Sep. From this to the 2nd of Jan 1841, my time was  wholly taken up in my temperal affairs and business for the Nauvoo  house. On this date I started on a tour through Ill, KY, Tenn, Miss,  and Lou, to New Orleans. And after traveling through these states receiving  many donations, and selling many shares in the Nauvoo house, I left N[ew] O[rleans]  March 15 with 47,500 lbs of sugar & molasses,^and 10 sacks of coffee^ a small quantity of dry goods  and 100 mormon passengers, and landed all in Nauvoo on the 27th in good   order.

 Historian's Office G. S. L. City,   Septr 5th 1857.    Brother Jackson,    I have to acknowledge receipt  of your Letter of [blank] together with a Packet  of Fruit Buds, &c. for which we feel much obliged  & thank you for the interest you manifest on our  behalf—The Grafts of Roses were mostly dead—the  Peaches were dead but the Plums and Pears were in   good order & we have the various kinds growing here  except the Duchesse d'Angouleme.    We think will forward you a List of such kinds  of Fruit as we would like to obtain, by this or the  next Mail and shall be obliged by your rendering such  assistance in forwarding same as you may be able.  Our experience shews us that grafts forwarded in the  Winter or Spring as they can be cut will be preferable.    We have received a great variety of choice fruit from  the Eastern States this season so that we have now  about a hundred varieties of Apples, Pears, Plums &  Cherries.    We shall be glad to receive any choice varieties of  Roses, Strawberries, Blackberries, Raspberries & Gooseberries, as  to currants we have some superior ^native^ varieties—If you can get a  choice running rose we are without such a thing & shall be  glad to have it. The Moss Rose which you have twice sent out  has been dead each time.

 New York March 27, 1846.    Dear Brother Little.    In great haste I sit down to say a few  words to you before I leave the City. Had a long in-  terview with Mr. Benson yesterday and he exceedingly  desires to do business with us he says if he does it  for nothing. I was much pleased with my interview  with him. He appears to me to be a gentleman. I think  it will be well to keep upon good terms with him as far  as possible. I would like to have Emigration continue  as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands. But  I think it right for us to see our way clear in charter-  ing ships.—by getting subscriptions among the Saints  for that purpose before running any risks, that would  be detrimental to the course and a disadvantage to the  Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Benson  with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as  you can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere.  I would prefer to continue business with him, as he  apparently manifests much interest in our welfare. I  hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number  out by fall if not before. Bro. Appleby has left the  business entirely in regards to chartering a vessel in  your hands and is going out with a company by lands,    My respects to Sister Little and all the   Saints.    I remain your Bro. in the Church    W. Woodruff.    A true copy from the original.    By J C Little Jr.

 We have reaped the largest crops this season ever  known in these vallies. The Tithing office begins to receive new  tithing having 11,000 bushels of last year's wheat on hand. Peaches  are becoming very plentiful. And Doctor Willard Richards family yesterday  carried in 100 apples as their Tithing apples. The currants were   a mammoth crop this season. Brother Hemanway brought me a  specimen which were larger than cherries, and of a very fine flavour.    We have much cause to be grateful to our Heavenly Father  for his abundant goodness to us as a people this season, the  elements have conspired just to favor us. We have had several excellent  showers this summer; and hay lots, on which 2 & 3 tons of hay  were cut last season, have produced this season 10 & 12 tons.    September 4th. Thomas B. Marsh, with a part of bro. Walkers  immigrating coy. arrived.    6th. Thomas B.

 Historians Office  G. S Lake City Augt, 4th 1857    To The Editor of the  Western Standard    The California Mail arrived here on the  evening of the 2nd inst. by which we have received our files of the  Standard.    The weather for the past month was considered warm and  dry—a rich harvest has been reapt in many settlements and others  are busingly engaged reaping.    The 4th of July was celebrated with a grand military review;  many of the regiments appeared to great advantage with their new   uniform.    The 24th was celebrated at the head waters of Big Cottonwood  Kanyon—I embraced the privilege of accompanying the invited of  that secluded retreat, where we spent a pleasant time. The G. S. L.   City Ogden, and Springville brass & martial bands were present & filled  the air with melody.    The party consisted of 2507 persons with 464 carriages & wagons,  1028 horses and mules and 332 oxen and cows. The light artillery  brought a howitzer along, which spoke in high tones from its exalted  position. While here Elders A. O. Smoot, O. P. Rockwell and Judson  Stoddard arrived from the States, bringing the intelligence that the Mail  Contract had been taken from Ms Kimball - that [blank] Cummins  was appointed Governor and a full bench of Judges & other officers   were appointed - to be accompanied by 2500 troops as a small body  guard and 700 teams and wagons laden with baggage and provisions  for 15 months.

 Stewart^d^, A. J.    Pittsourg Pa.    Wilson Woodruff,    Dear Sir;    To-day I write to  you in regard to your  prophysisying. You have  I think been prophyi  sying for some time.

 living in strict obedience to the laws of their country & having proved themselves  devoted & loyal to its constitution, this was certainly a startling announcement, but aware  that certain renegades who had found their way hither in the charades of U. S. Officials  & who had left our midst filled with bitter invectives against a people who would  sustain good & wholesome laws we were led to antisipate that hostile movements  against this people would be resorted to if possible; but arrived it all we pursue  the even tenor of our way, relying upon that God who has brought us up  hither to sustain us, knowing that the wrath of man God overrules to his   praise—the residue he retrains.    Our streets are daily thronged with emigrants from the States for  California, who find this an agreeable oasis where man & beast may  rest & recruit. The walls of the Temple rise steadily and the  [Temple Square, Great Salt Lake City, Great Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple Block presents a spectacle of industry throughout every  department.    Elder Whipple informs us that prospects are favorable for a  wheat crop at Fort Supply, he brought in 2000 cedar ports staves  for brickels, &c    The Presidency are well in health & spirits; and we are much  favored lately with their teachings.    The Twelve at home are busy harvesting, haying &c. I am  necessarily most of the time in the office. Elder Geo A Smith  has started on a visit to his family at Parowan.

Smith:    Dear Brethren:    I respectfully ask for your consent to my  carrying out the following plan:    I intend to form a company of $350,000 consisting of seven  shares of $50,000 each. This company will be formed upon  this basis; take out small dividends and allow the reserved  profits to be used as Capital. There is room for the mulipli-  cation of the capital because it will require today 400  Factories to supply the United States with sugar, and this  capital will be used in this direction.    I know already of some 8 or 10 places in Nebraska and   Iowa who are offering bonuses of from $40,000 to $100,000  & in one case $150,000 for a company to erect a Sugar factory  within their neighborhood. I am prepared to show, as I have  already explained to you that it is possible with proper effort  to make each Factory pay 10% and a reserve of one half (at least)  of its cash (say $250,000). With the capital mentioned above  and such bonus as may be received, the first factory will  be built and leave enough surplus of the capital which added  to a second bonus the reserved profits of the itself to build  a second factory the second year; then the two Factories

 OFFICE OF   THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,  P. O. BOX 499.  Secretary's Department.    Salt Lake City, Utah, 18    will build a third factory the third year and the fourth  year the three factories will build one if not two factories.  The four factories the fifth year will build two more making  six and the sixth year the six will build three making  nine factories.                 Thus in 1891 one factory pay 10% =   340,000      1892 two [factory pay 10% =] 80,000      1893 three [factory pay 10% =] 120,000     1894 four [factory pay 10% =] 160,000      1895 six [factory pay 10% =] 240,000      1896 nine [factory pay 10% =] 360,000      Total. $1000,000 dividends     The nine factories will be worth at least $300,000 each  or $2,700,000 if it is desired to sell them to local syndicates,  or if to keep them they will bring an income, if youwe do not  build any more factories, of 2¼ millions a year provided the  bounty is still continued, if it is not continued the income  would be only one half of that amount. The capital  at above estimate would be paid back nine times over  in Six years.        But supposing only one half of this be realized it is  then as good an investment as can be heard of nowadays. 
 OFFICE OF   THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,  P. O. BOX 499.  Secretary's Department.    Salt Lake City, Utah, 18    This is no wild scheme, it is perfectly feasible and easy of solution.   I had hoped to have been able to carry it out with the home  company as a nucleus, but I plainly see that I have no oppor-  tunity of doing so, therefore am compelled to seek new associations  for the purpose. I have already secured some capital in this  direction with the understanding that I be a partner to the  extent of one eighth and I have no doubt of securing all I need  from selected persons. The plan is in perfect line with the  principle of production and belongs to that branch of financial  power; and its efficacy has already been demonstrated by  such men as Phil Armour, Rockefeller & many others of the  world's giants who have got hold of the end of a big thing, clung  to it, and being satisfied with small dividends at first have  multiplied their capital in the same line of business.    Will you kindly give me an interview on this subject at your   early convenience, today if possible.    Very respectfully    Arthur Stayner 
 Salt Lake City, March 24, 1893.    Gentlemen:    I respectfully make the following proposition  relative to organizing and incorporating a company for  the operation and working of our "Marble Agate" Onyx Mine,  at Pelican Point, Utah:    The Corporation to have a paid capital of $100,000, divid-  ed into 2000 shares of $50 each, to be contributed and paid  in as follows:    1.

Cash, to be paid in as working capital and improvements, 50,000    We, the present owners of the mine, propose to contribute  the mining property, conveying perfect patent title to the  corporation, for the consideration of one-half the stock, to  be considered fully paid up and non-assessable. The remain-  ing stock to be contributed by the other incorporators as  follows, and for which they will be entitled to one-half of  the whole capital stock of the company, to wit:    1. At least $25,000 in an Onyx plant or Works, for the saw-  ing, manufacturing and otherwise rendering fit for market  the products of the property; said works to be begun immediate[-]  ly after incorporation, and work thereon and therein to be  prosecuted without cessation thereafter.

I am a young man  thirty years of age and unmarried. I have  never given much attention to religion  until within the last year. Somehow  I thought a good deal of the church you  are the chief of, and read all I could about  the teachings.

 one here who could tell me? I would  like to go to Salt Lake City but just  now I cannot afford it. It seems to  me that just as I was about thinking  of your church, I lost all of the little  money I had in real estate. But I  will try over again. I have been a  writer and worked about houses a good  deal and then did some work in [stores].    I wish vary much to hear from  you. I think I might make a good  member after teaching — I know I would  be obedient and earnest. I will be  here for aone week and if you could  write me so that a letter would reach  me by Friday next I would be greatly  obliged. Please just address.

Our Temple in this City is approach-  ing such stages in the course of completion  that suggests the necessity of providing means   for heating and lighting, that will be suitable  for such an edifice as a Temple; and if modern  methods are adopted there will be a large  amount of work required to be done, and when  the word is completed. The management of the  Apparatus will require some little ability. If the  suggestion is not premature I would respectfully  offer my services in that capacity, If earlier appli-  cations have not recieved favorable considerations.  If not please consider mine    Your Brother in the Gospel  G G Bywater

 Mount Pleasant, June 23rd 1894      President W. Woodruff  S. L. City  Dear Brother:    In reply to yours of the 19th 18 inst  will say: If nothing unforeseen shall  hinder me I will be on hand to  leave on the day stated ^in^ your letter  September 8th.    Your Brother   in the Gospel  J. H. Hansen    C. N. Lund.  Bp;    All right  J. F. S. 
 Substance of contents of accompanying letter:    I write for information regarding your colony. I wish to come to your  place. I have still some fortune in Germany, consisting of a house and farming  land, also three children. The children say they will come to this country. I   have read in the newspapers that you have agents in Switzerland, and thought per-  haps you had one in Alsaice. If you have I wish you would have him attend to my   business there, and meet my children and explain to them. If you will do this I  will send you authority to act for me; and if I receive any mony from them then I  will come to your country. I have already received some information from a member  of your church by the name of James Myer Hill. What he told me I have long thought  to be true, and I have already experienced that it was true. A great many families  here have only one or two children, and they think by so doing they are doing right  but they have no luck either in their increase or their life. Goes on to relate  that a pastor there had one son; ^the pastor^ took sick and died suddenly; his wife after a  long sickness also died; the son became crazy and was put in an asylum; he after-  wards came out, married a French lady, moved to France; she got the fortune and  left him pennyless. He asks for information concerning church doctrines, and how  to get here. Encloses stamps and requests immediate answer - he is evidently in a hurry. 
 University of Utah.    Salt Lake City, March 13th, 1894    To the Presidency of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.    Gentlemen:    From my con-  versation with Dr. Talmage I under-  stand that the small appropriations  made to the University of Utah by the Legis-  lature may cause you to feel that the  conditions are such as to make doubtful  of the advisability of suspending the  church University, and that owing   to the retrogressive condition of that  institution and its uncertain future  Your communication to me may not  stand. As this matter involves my personal  interests and as the meagre funds of the Uni-  versity will necessetate immediate action  on the part of the regents, I would deem  it a very great favor if you could immediately  render a decision in regard to it. I shall  await with pleasure your very earliest  reply    Very Respectfully  J T Kingsbury  acting President.

On Dec 13th 1893 I recieved a letter from you  calling me on a mission to Great Britian. upon  the advice of Bishop Page.

I have no choice where I go, Where ever my  services are most needed, and this I will leave  you to decide. So far as going to Provo is concer-  ned, I have not been consullted in relation to ^it^ and there-  fore have no preparation made, and as I will be eng-  aged at Sunday School Conference, in Provo, tomorrow  and Sunday, at which I have been appointed to con-  duct a Theological class exercise, it would be impos-  sible for me to commence with the begining of  this term, but you decide it is better that I shall  go there instead of to Great Britan. I could possibly  arrange for someone to conduct my business  and put it in shapeto spend the second term  of the current school year at the academy.    Your wishes will govern me in this  matter    Your Brother in the gospel  John D. Irvine    See over.

 MR. SMITH'S "REVELATION."    THE new declaration of Mormon faith  adopted at the recent conference of the   Elders at Salt Lake City is, with the ex-  ception of the article expressing obedience  to the law, identical with the original  declaration drawn up and promulgated in  1842 by JOSEPH SMITH, the founder of the  sect. It therefore — although the Elders  may not be aware of the fact — affords an  opportunity of an early test of the genuine-  ness of one at least of the Divine revela-  tions which SMITH claimed to have re-  cieved. Both declarations contain the  following article: "We believe in the   " literal gathering of Israel and in the   " restoration of the ten tribes; that Zion  " will be built upon this continent; that  " CHRIST will reign personally upon the  " earth, and that the earth will be renewed  " and receive its Paradisiacal glory."  Now, in his "Autobiography," SMITH told  his followers that it had been revealed to  him when the second coming of CHRIST  would take place. He did so in the fol-  lowing passage: "I was once praying  " very earnestly to know the time of the  " coming of the Son of Man when I heard  " a voice repeat the following: 'JOSEPH,  " ' my son, it thou livest until thou art  " ' eighty-five years old, thou shalt see  " ' the face of the Son of Man; there-  " ' fore, let this suffice, and trouble me  " ' no more in this matter,'" As JOSEPH  was born on December 23, 1805, this "re-  "velation" fixes as the same date of the  present year as the time of the second  coming. On that day, then, the honesty  of the founder of Mormonism will  be put to the test. Should the  "revelation" prove to have been  incorrect it will, of course, be open to the   present head of the Church to assert that  he also has had one explaining the diffi-  culty in a satisfactory manner, just as he  has had one authorizing him to throw  polygamy overboard at a time when its  retention had become embarrassing and  was likely to prove disastrous to the   Church. But this will not do. Either  the "revelation" made to JOSEPH SMITH  is true or it is not. If on December 23  next we find that it is not, there will be  even more reason than ever to believe the   founder of Mormonism to have been a   rank imposter. As it is, no one outside  of the Mormons themselves believes other-  wise of him, bit it will be satisfactory to  have even at this late day a new proof of  his imposture.    EDITORIAL NOTES.    Mr. Hesson, M. P., who has just returned  from a visit to the North-West and British  Columbia, reports that the Calgary exhi-  bition, the experiment farms at Brandon,  and several other places, he saw samples of   two-rowed barley equal, if not superior, to  any he had ever seen. The grain, he says,  was firm, bright, solid, and perfectly healthy.  If it be true, as Mr. Hesson maintains, that  the North-West can produce barley that will   suit the English market, the news is satis-

Dear Brother:    Your letter of the  19th inst. at hand, and will say in  reply that I am willing to take a   mission to Southern States. I feel  very incapable, but with the help of God  some good may be accomplished. Will  accept the call made of me at least.  I would very much like until the  first of November in which to provide  means for going, but if there is no  company of Elders going about that   time, I can try to get ready by about   the middle of October. It seems impos-  sible to go on the 8th of Sept. If you
