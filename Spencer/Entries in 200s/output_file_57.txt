 Pleasant Grove, Utah  January 3th 1894.    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    your notice dated S L.C. Dec 18  have come to hand.    In regard to going on a mision  to Scandinavia, I must state,  that I see no possibility at present,  to go to that way of land, because  the means nessessary I could not  obtain at present, for the reason  that the property I have to despose  of is not the kind that can be  conveyed into cash in theese days

 306  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    in the wilderness.  It is not necessary for me to spend time in tracing this  Priesthood through the six thousand years that have past and gone; but  it has been manifest in every age and dispensation when God has had  prophets and apostles on the earth.  Jesus Christ came ito the world in  the meridian of time.  He was the Great High Priest to Israel.  He was   the Son of God, the Savior of the world.  He chose His Apostles, He  organized His Church.  He bestowed upon these Apostles all the gifts and  graces belonging to the apostleship.  In that dispensation it seems that  they were called to lay down their lives for the word of God and testimony  of Jesus Christ.  The Savior himself was put to death.  The Apostles  were all, with one exception, put to death in their day and time, until  finally the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there for a  length of time.  But my views are that whenever the inhabitants of the  earth were prepared for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of the  Priesthood, it has been bestowed upon them.    In the days of the Savior and His Apostles, John the Revelator, while  upon the Isle of Patmos, gave an outline of great events which were to  transpire in the last dispensation of the fulness of times.  Other prophets  and apostles, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghose,  left on the pages of history a record of what the Lord would do in the  last dispensation.  Among the great events that the Revelator saw was  the one described in the 14th chapter of his Revelation, and which is often  quoted by our elders, because it is very applicable.    And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever-  lasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every  nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the   hour of his judgment is come.    If this revelation had not been fulfilled, neither you nor I would be here  to-day, this Tabernacle would not be erected, this city would be still part  of the Great American Desert, as we found it; but in the fulfilment of  the revelations of God, these things have been done and some of us have  lived to see them.  The angel of God did visit Joseph Smith, the Prophet  of God, who was raised up by the power of God as a prophet, seer and  revelator, and who organized the Church of Jesus Christ in the earth.  From that day until this the work has progressed and the Gospel has  been preached.  The Holy Ghost has been with the people.  The Lord  Almighty has set His hand to carry out the great programme--to establish  the Zion of God in the earth and to prepare the people for the coming of  the Son of Man.    These are my views with regard to the calling of men in this dispensa-  tion.  Gold and silver may pass away; houses and lands may perish; all  temporal matters will pass away; but the Priesthood never, salvation  never, the kingdom of God never, and prophecy will never fall unfulfilled.  We have had Apostles now for upwards of sixty years.  Many have died  and gone to the other side of the viel; and those upon whom God bestowed  the glory and power of the organization of theChurch have sealed their  testimony with their blood, as the ancient Apostles did.  They have gone

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    307    home to receive their reward; but that organization has remained; the  Holy Priesthood has been given to the sons of men and has remained  upon their heads, and will remain upon the heads of his people until the  coming of the Son of Man.  Therefore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, we  are in this organization to-day.  I do not pretend to say exactly the num-  ber that we have in the Priesthood; but we have from fifteen to twenty  thousand Elders in this Church; we have many various organizations of  the Priesthood, and curches are organized throughout the world as far  as we have had an opportunity.  I have been called, these Apostles have,  many of the Elders have, to go to the nations of the earth and the islands  of the sea to preach the Gospel to our fellow-men.  What greater calling  can any man have on the face of the earth than to hold in his hands  power and authority to go forth and administer in the ordinances of  salvation?  Do we prize these things in their fullness?  I do not think  we do.  Nevertheless, so far we have been enabled to maintain our posi-  tion, and to go forth and fulfill our missions are far as we have had time  and opportunity.  Certainly there has been nothing in this work that I  have had greater consolation in than in preaching the Gospel to my fellow-  men and in administering unto them the ordinances of the house of God,  both for the living and the dead.  I may say the same with regard to my  brethren who are called to perform those ordinances.    There was something said yesterday by the brethren with regard to our  sons and our missionaries abroad.  I will say for myself--and when I say  it for myself I think I speak for a great many others--there isno joy that  I have ever had that has been greater than that which has come to me in  having sons received the Holy Priesthood and go forth and administer  among the nations of the earth the ordinances of life and salvation.  It  is a glorious gift to the sons of men.  It is what men havenot enjoyed  before us for thelast eighteen hundred years almost.  Then should we not  prize these things?  Yes, we should. The Lord, in the dispensation of His  providences, has given to us an army of sons and daughters, and our sons  are called to go to the nations of the earth.  We want to instill into their  minds the importance of these blessings to the inhavitants of the earth  and the saving of souls from sin.  You give unto any soul the principles  of life and salvation and administer these ordinances to him, and you  become an instrument in the hands of God in the salvation of that soul.    There is nothing given to the children of men that is equal to it.    This is our position to-day in these mountains.  We have been led here  by the power of God--led by a prophet, seer and revelator, President  Brigham Young, who was full of the Holy Ghose and full of revelation,  appointed of the Lord, and who magnified his calling up to the hour of  his death.  We came here and found a barren desert.  From that day till  this it has been a continual growth and increase, until we have arrived at  a point where we have a tabernacle as a 'shadow in the daytime from the  heat   *   *    *  and for a covert from storm and from rain."  These  things have all been prophesied of thousands of eyars ago by the ancient  prophets and patriarchs who foresaw the work of God in the last days.    I want to say a few words to our young men who are rising up among

A little over tow years ago, when I  was leiving at St Thomas, Lincoln Coun-  ty, Nevada, I got aquinted with late  Brother John Quarenberg, that had  left Scipio, on acount of Pollagamy  Persecution. I made and indquiering  about Scipio, and if he could not  tell me about a Wommen, that —  needed a man to help her to raise  her Children, and that I was a man  of Charrty, and that I was willing to do so.  And he give me the Description, —  of one, a denish Wommen, and a   Wedow, that had five Children.  That he had a little Farm; but still  soported by the Fast Doanation. 
 308    LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    us.  I want them to comprehend and understand the blessings that are  within their reach.  The Lord has given us a large number of sons and  daughters.  They have got to take the places of their fathers, the same as  the sons of Adam had in his day and generation.  A great responsibility  rests upon them.  The Lord requires at the hands of our sons that they  shall bear off this kingdom of our God while they dwell in the flesh, that  they may be justified.  The Lord told Oliver Cowdery.  "And if it so be  that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this  people, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your  jow tiht him in the kingdom of my Father."  It requires light, knowledge,  and understanding; it requires the spirit and power of God for us to  comprehend our position, our blessings, and our gifts that God has placed  upon us.  I feel to rejoice and thank God myself that I have lived to see  what I do in these valleys of the mountains; that I have lived to see  these multitudes that fill these tabernacles and temples and labor here  in the building up of the kingdom of God.  The Lord has been very mer-  ciful to me, and my life has been preserved to pass through these things,  and I still remain in the midst of this people.  I have to acknowledge the  hand of God in the whole of it.  I suppose you have to do so with regard  to your lives.  The face is, these is not a blessing that God has bestowed  upon us from the beginning but has been the gift of God.  We should  understand this.  We have preached the Gospel to every nation, kin-  dred, tongue, and people as far as the Lord has opened doors for us  and we have had the privilege of going.  Still the world to-day is full of  people who have not heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and while the  Priesthood rests upon our shoulders we are still under obligation and are  still held responsible for the salvation of the children of men, as far as we  have the privilege of bestowing these gifts upon the sons and daughters of  Adam.  Only think that by embracing the Gospel of Christ we can become  heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that we can have part in  the first resurrection, and come forth out of our graves and be clothed with  glory, immortality, and eternal lives, and pass into the presence of God  and the Lamb and dwell with them eternally in the heavens!  Weo com-  prehends this?  Do the inhabitants of the earth?  They do not.  Satan  has warred against us from the organization of this Church, to try and  destroy this people; but so far we have been preserved.  We should be  thankful for these blessings.  I realize myself that we are dependent upon  the Lord in all things.  The Lord is our preserver.  He is the author of  our salvation.  Jesus Christ has laid down His life to redeem us by His  blood, and through that we have these blessings bestowed upon us.    Among other things, we live in a generation in which the Lord has  enabled us to rear several temples--some in thse mountains and some before we came here; and hundreds and thousands of people go into these  temples to redeem their head.  This is a blessing the Latter-day Saints  should prize.  It is a duty that is required at our hands to do what we can in  this direction.  It is a blessing that the inhabitants of the earth have not  had for centuries until this dispensation.  I hope that no man who has got  a record of his father's house will go down to his grave without having

I feel that while the Lord has given us this bless-  ing, every man and woman in this Church that has any faither at all in God  and in the Gospel should attend to this duty.  Jesus Christ, while His  body lay in the tomb, went and preached to the spirits in prison, that were  drowned in the days of Noah by the flood, because of their wickedness and  abominations.  They had been in prison for a long time, and He went and  preached to them, 'that they might be judged according to men in the  flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."  Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith,  David Patten, and the apostles and Elders who have been true and faith-  ful unto death have also gone to the spirits in prison in their day and time  and preached the Gospel of Christ to their fathers' houses and to those  who are shut up in prison, and they are laboring there for the salvation of  the children ofmen.  These are glorious principles--principles which the  Latter-day Saints should not neglect while they have the privilege and  power.  As I said in the beginning, there isno calling a man can be called  to any greater than to have this right and privilege to go forth and save  the souls of men--save them by preaching the Gospel to them, by adminis-  tering the ordinances of the house of God to them, that they may be pre-  pared themselves to go into the kingdom of heaven and into a celestial  glory.  There are three glories.  Paul in speaking upon that subject said  "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of themoon, and another  glory of the stars:  for one star differeth from another star in glory.  So  also is the resurrection of the dead."  These glories over-shadow the while  human family.  Now, how much better it is for a man to receive these  ordinances, that he may go where God and Christ dwell, which is the  highest glory!  But Jesus said in His day, "Strait is the gate, and  narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;"  while "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and may there be  which go in thereat."  I think many times that we ourselves do not prize  the blessings that we enjoy and that are within our reach.  Our hearts  should be set upon the building up of the kingdom of God, the Zion of  God, and the world of God, while we are here and have power to perform  these things.  It is our duty as the Presidency and as Apostles, not only  to labor ourselves, but to send forth the Elders of Israel to the nations of  the earth to proclaim the Gospel.  Doors are open to-day among many of  the nations for the spread of the Gospel of Christ, and to bring the people  unto Christ, that they may receive these blessings.    Brethren and sisters, this isd the way I feel this morning.  Of all people  under heavens we should be the best, the most righteous, and the most true  and faithful to God and to our fellow-men.  We should be true and faith-  ful to the Holy Priesthood while we have it resting upon us, and true to  our labors.  I rejoice at our condition today.  I rejoice at the peace that

 310   LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    has come unto us by the power and blessing of God.  I rejoice at the  change that is taking place in the world.  We are visited now by hundreds  of people from thenations of the earth.  They are coming to behold the  glory of Zion.  They come to enquire at our hands concerning various  matters, and there is a very different feelings to what there was in former  days toward us.  Brother John W. Taylor referred to our going to St.  Louis and to Chicago.  Yes, I recollect very well when we went into Jackson  County, Missouri.  My labors there have been alluded to.  When I went on  my first mission in 1834, I had to go through Jackson County on my way to  Arkansas.  It was just after our brethren hae been driven out.  I had to  go and hide in the cornfields and in the brush during the day, and walk  along in the night, till I got through that country, for the lives of myself  and companion were in danger there.  The last time I went there, the  Mayor of Independence came out to meet us with a fine carriage.  He had  but one arm, having lost the other in the army, but he gave us that arm and  made us welcome.  I could not help but feel the difference between then and  when Iwent through there as a missionary.  These is a change taking place.  Zion is going to rise and shine, and the glory of God will rest upon her.  This people, if they do their duty, will fulfill and carry out these great  principles, and the eyes of the world will be turned toward Zion, and men  will come to enquire concerning the things of thekingdom of God.  We are  in a good condition.  We are blessed of the Lord.  The Latter-day Saints  have never been so well off temporally.  Go into the houses of the Latter-  day Saints, and you will find them in a better position than they have ever  been before.  These are the blessings of God, and we should prize these  things and give God the glory for them, while we try to do our duty and  magnity our calling.  I want to say that I am in for salvation and for  eternal life.  I have labored for that since I was a boy.  I have desired the  gifts, and graces, and blessings manifest in the days of Jesus and His  Apostles.  In my childhood I prayed God that I might live to see a prophet  of somebody who could teach me the principles I read in the New Testa-  ment.  The clergy of the day did not do it.  Nobody around there appeared  to believe in such tings.  Well, I have lived to see prophets and apostles;  I have lived to travel with them and to unite with them in thekingdom  of God.  I have been in the apostleship fifty-eight years; I have been in  the Church sixty-three years.  My while life almost has been spent in this  Church; and from the time I came into the Church I went on missions  and have never ceased altogether from that day to this.  I have always  rejoiced in this, and do to-day.  When I die and lay down my body, I  do not want anybody to rise up and say that I have neglected my duty  in trying to give him salvation as far as I could.  I have always rejoiced  in preaching the Gospel; I have rejoiced in administering the ordi-  ances of life and salvation at home and abroad, because i have known that  this was the work of God, and I know it is to-day.    I want to say now to the rising generation, gird up the loins of your minds, prepare yourselves, and realize you ahve a mission before you.  Who are going to bear this kingdom off when we go to the grave?  To  whom does the Gof of Israel look to do this?  He looks to oursons and

There is nothing  like it on earth.  You may get the riches of the world; they pass away;  but eternal life, celestial glory, a place with the righteous after resurrec-  tion, with immortal bodies, are worth more than all this world can give.  I have condifence to believe that the Latter-day Saints will carry out these  principles and magnify their calling before the Lord.  I have hopes that  our sons and daughtes will do the same.    Brethren and sisters, I say, God bless you.  I am glad to meet with you.  I rejoice in the Gospel, in the kingdom of God, and in the Holy Priesthood.  I pray God to bless you, to open your eyes to see, and ears to hear, and  your hearts to understand.  I pray God to open your understanding, that  you may comprehend the value and blessing of the Gospel that you have  received and of the blessings of these temples and tabernacles in the  midst of which you have the privilege of dwelling and receiving the  ordinances of God.  I pray that we may pursue that course that when  we get on the other side of the veil we shall be satisfied with our  record.  We will find our history and our record these in the great library  of the celestial kingdom of our God, and we will know what we have been  doing in this life.  If we do anything that is wrong we will be sorry for  it.  We should repent of wrong and try to do better.  I pray that the  Spirit of God may be with us to guide and direct us in our labors until we  get through here, then when we pass awy we may be received in the  kingdom of God.  We shall rejoice if we do right; for our eyes have not  seen, or ears havenot heard, and it has never entered into the hearts of  the children of men the glory that lies before the sons and daughters of  adm.  It is hidden from our eyes to-day, and will never be open to us  until we enter into the presence of God and the Lamb.  Amen

I would prefer going as per call if  necessary means can be raised but if not I will make  arraingments to be ready to go by the 1st of April  wanting your answer Yours in the Gospel Covenants    Loren S.

I am pleased to accept this call, and   hope that in this service, I may be instrumental   in bringing some souls to repentance, and to see   the light and beauty of the Everlasting   Gospel, as revealed by our Heavenly Father  in this the latter day.

Salt Lake City, Utah, September 16th, 1897    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:-    Your letter of July 19th, 1897 came duly to hand, and contents   carefully noted.  You will please excuse my seeming tardiness in not  replying sooner, but as I consider it a very great and serious matter for   a young man like me to assume the responsibility of going on a mission,   to teach and preach the principals of the Gospel when I really do not   understand them myself, notwithstanding having been born and raised in   the church.  A doubt has existed in my mind whether I should go or not.   Being desirous of doing all the good I can in this world I have concluded   to go and add my feeble effort to those already in the field. . I will   therefore make preparations in accordance with your letter of July to   start October 16th.    Respectfully Your Brother,    A. T. Hill    I Endorse the Above  Geo H.

I have been waiting   thinking I could get my affairs   in order so I could go, but I find   I cannot possibly get ready by   the appointed time. I am in   debt some & will be obliged to   straighten before I can leave home  and I cannot do that untill my   crop is harvested. I will try to   prepare my self by the next   time there are Elders called to   that part of the ministry again.  Your Brother, A. T. Hoagland.    Let him report when ready. J. F. S.

 Colonia Juarez Mch. 28th, 1898    President Wilford Woodruff  and Counsellors.    Dear Brethren.    I have not been  able to answer your letter of Feby 9th,  in which you ask us to submit names  for missionary service, sooner on  account of having been away at  the city of Mexxico from which  point I have onnly recently re-  turned.    I enclose a list of names from  Colonia Dublan, none from other  Colonies as they already have a number  out and those of the brethren whom  we could recommend for missions  are very much needed at home.    As soon however as some of those  now out are released we shall  be ready to fill their places with  others. Your Brother    A. W. Ivins

If there will be any elders going to   Switzerland & Germany a month or   two later than march 3rd   It would be more conveniant for me   to wait till then, as I have lo[a]ned   to a new flour mill here all the   money I had. And as they are a new   ferm they are very crowded, and   say they can hardly get it so soon.  As for my self I am ready   as soon as I can get the money.

 Moroni Ward.  Moroni, Sanpete Co. Utah.   March 6, 1894.    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother,    Some   time since, I received a letter signed by   you, dated Jan. 8th last, addressed to   "Adam" Hardy Jr. Moroni, notifying him   of being called to go on a Mission to the Southern   States, to start June 9th &c.    I wish to say that there is no Adam   Hardy, in this Ward. If I am the person   for whom the call was intended, permit me   to say that my reason for not answering sooner   was that I was held as surety on an obligation   of a friend, which I had to pay on the 3rd inst.  I had hoped it would be otherwise, that I might  report myself ready to start as above, if wanted.  I have had to part with all my available means,   but if I am wanted, I respectfully desire six   months or more time in which to raise the nec-  cessary means when, although realizing my in-  ability to do much good, I will ^go and^ do the best I  can.    I remain  Your Brother  Aaron Hardy Jr.    J W Jons Bp    He is no doubt the man  we want. Give him the   time he needs. J. F. S.

Winkler    Peter Matson   Bishops Counselor    Let him crowd his claims   so far as he reasonably can,  but he can have what   time he needs, and we   can arrange for him   to go with company.  J. F.

States,   does not state the day of   June that I am expected to   go but I supposed you would   let me know the exact day   of June that I shall start.  Please can you now let me  know the exact day.    I have heard a rumor   that those who don't go in   May will not go until Sept.
