 306  LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.in the wilderness.  It is not necessary for me to spend time in tracing thisPriesthood through the six thousand years that have past and gone; butit has been manifest in every age and dispensation when God has hadprophets and apostles on the earth.  Jesus Christ came ito the world inthe meridian of time.  He was the Great High Priest to Israel.  He was the Son of God, the Savior of the world.  He chose His Apostles, Heorganized His Church.  He bestowed upon these Apostles all the gifts andgraces belonging to the apostleship.  In that dispensation it seems thatthey were called to lay down their lives for the word of God and testimonyof Jesus Christ.  The Savior himself was put to death.  The Apostleswere all, with one exception, put to death in their day and time, untilfinally the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there for alength of time.  But my views are that whenever the inhabitants of theearth were prepared for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of thePriesthood, it has been bestowed upon them.In the days of the Savior and His Apostles, John the Revelator, whileupon the Isle of Patmos, gave an outline of great events which were totranspire in the last dispensation of the fulness of times.  Other prophetsand apostles, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghose,left on the pages of history a record of what the Lord would do in thelast dispensation.  Among the great events that the Revelator saw wasthe one described in the 14th chapter of his Revelation, and which is oftenquoted by our elders, because it is very applicable.And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever-lasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to everynation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.If this revelation had not been fulfilled, neither you nor I would be hereto-day, this Tabernacle would not be erected, this city would be still partof the Great American Desert, as we found it; but in the fulfilment ofthe revelations of God, these things have been done and some of us havelived to see them.  The angel of God did visit Joseph Smith, the Prophetof God, who was raised up by the power of God as a prophet, seer andrevelator, and who organized the Church of Jesus Christ in the earth.From that day until this the work has progressed and the Gospel hasbeen preached.  The Holy Ghost has been with the people.  The LordAlmighty has set His hand to carry out the great programme--to establishthe Zion of God in the earth and to prepare the people for the coming ofthe Son of Man.These are my views with regard to the calling of men in this dispensa-tion.  Gold and silver may pass away; houses and lands may perish; alltemporal matters will pass away; but the Priesthood never, salvationnever, the kingdom of God never, and prophecy will never fall unfulfilled.We have had Apostles now for upwards of sixty years.  Many have diedand gone to the other side of the viel; and those upon whom God bestowedthe glory and power of the organization of theChurch have sealed theirtestimony with their blood, as the ancient Apostles did.  They have gone

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    307home to receive their reward; but that organization has remained; theHoly Priesthood has been given to the sons of men and has remainedupon their heads, and will remain upon the heads of his people until thecoming of the Son of Man.  Therefore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, weare in this organization to-day.  I do not pretend to say exactly the num-ber that we have in the Priesthood; but we have from fifteen to twentythousand Elders in this Church; we have many various organizations ofthe Priesthood, and curches are organized throughout the world as faras we have had an opportunity.  I have been called, these Apostles have,many of the Elders have, to go to the nations of the earth and the islandsof the sea to preach the Gospel to our fellow-men.  What greater callingcan any man have on the face of the earth than to hold in his handspower and authority to go forth and administer in the ordinances ofsalvation?  Do we prize these things in their fullness?  I do not thinkwe do.  Nevertheless, so far we have been enabled to maintain our posi-tion, and to go forth and fulfill our missions are far as we have had timeand opportunity.  Certainly there has been nothing in this work that Ihave had greater consolation in than in preaching the Gospel to my fellow-men and in administering unto them the ordinances of the house of God,both for the living and the dead.  I may say the same with regard to mybrethren who are called to perform those ordinances.There was something said yesterday by the brethren with regard to oursons and our missionaries abroad.  I will say for myself--and when I sayit for myself I think I speak for a great many others--there isno joy thatI have ever had that has been greater than that which has come to me inhaving sons received the Holy Priesthood and go forth and administeramong the nations of the earth the ordinances of life and salvation.  Itis a glorious gift to the sons of men.  It is what men havenot enjoyedbefore us for thelast eighteen hundred years almost.  Then should we notprize these things?  Yes, we should. The Lord, in the dispensation of Hisprovidences, has given to us an army of sons and daughters, and our sonsare called to go to the nations of the earth.  We want to instill into theirminds the importance of these blessings to the inhavitants of the earthand the saving of souls from sin.  You give unto any soul the principlesof life and salvation and administer these ordinances to him, and youbecome an instrument in the hands of God in the salvation of that soul.  There is nothing given to the children of men that is equal to it.This is our position to-day in these mountains.  We have been led hereby the power of God--led by a prophet, seer and revelator, PresidentBrigham Young, who was full of the Holy Ghose and full of revelation,appointed of the Lord, and who magnified his calling up to the hour ofhis death.  We came here and found a barren desert.  From that day tillthis it has been a continual growth and increase, until we have arrived ata point where we have a tabernacle as a 'shadow in the daytime from theheat   *   *    *  and for a covert from storm and from rain."  Thesethings have all been prophesied of thousands of eyars ago by the ancientprophets and patriarchs who foresaw the work of God in the last days.I want to say a few words to our young men who are rising up among

 308    LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.us.  I want them to comprehend and understand the blessings that arewithin their reach.  The Lord has given us a large number of sons anddaughters.  They have got to take the places of their fathers, the same asthe sons of Adam had in his day and generation.  A great responsibilityrests upon them.  The Lord requires at the hands of our sons that theyshall bear off this kingdom of our God while they dwell in the flesh, thatthey may be justified.  The Lord told Oliver Cowdery.  "And if it so bethat you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto thispeople, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be yourjow tiht him in the kingdom of my Father."  It requires light, knowledge,and understanding; it requires the spirit and power of God for us tocomprehend our position, our blessings, and our gifts that God has placedupon us.  I feel to rejoice and thank God myself that I have lived to seewhat I do in these valleys of the mountains; that I have lived to seethese multitudes that fill these tabernacles and temples and labor herein the building up of the kingdom of God.  The Lord has been very mer-ciful to me, and my life has been preserved to pass through these things,and I still remain in the midst of this people.  I have to acknowledge thehand of God in the whole of it.  I suppose you have to do so with regardto your lives.  The face is, these is not a blessing that God has bestowedupon us from the beginning but has been the gift of God.  We shouldunderstand this.  We have preached the Gospel to every nation, kin-dred, tongue, and people as far as the Lord has opened doors for usand we have had the privilege of going.  Still the world to-day is full ofpeople who have not heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and while thePriesthood rests upon our shoulders we are still under obligation and arestill held responsible for the salvation of the children of men, as far as wehave the privilege of bestowing these gifts upon the sons and daughters ofAdam.  Only think that by embracing the Gospel of Christ we can becomeheirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that we can have part inthe first resurrection, and come forth out of our graves and be clothed withglory, immortality, and eternal lives, and pass into the presence of Godand the Lamb and dwell with them eternally in the heavens!  Weo com-prehends this?  Do the inhabitants of the earth?  They do not.  Satanhas warred against us from the organization of this Church, to try anddestroy this people; but so far we have been preserved.  We should bethankful for these blessings.  I realize myself that we are dependent uponthe Lord in all things.  The Lord is our preserver.  He is the author ofour salvation.  Jesus Christ has laid down His life to redeem us by Hisblood, and through that we have these blessings bestowed upon us.Among other things, we live in a generation in which the Lord hasenabled us to rear several temples--some in thse mountains and some before we came here; and hundreds and thousands of people go into thesetemples to redeem their head.  This is a blessing the Latter-day Saintsshould prize.  It is a duty that is required at our hands to do what we can inthis direction.  It is a blessing that the inhabitants of the earth have nothad for centuries until this dispensation.  I hope that no man who has gota record of his father's house will go down to his grave without having

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.   309attended to this work.  How would I feel, after living as loong as I have,with the privileges I have had of going into these temples, to go into thespirit world without having done this work!  I meet my father's house, Imeet my mother's house, I meet my progenitors, and they are shut up onprison; I held the keys of their salvation, and yet did nothing for them;what would be my feelings, or what would be their feelings toward me?They would not like it.  I feel that while the Lord has given us this bless-ing, every man and woman in this Church that has any faither at all in Godand in the Gospel should attend to this duty.  Jesus Christ, while Hisbody lay in the tomb, went and preached to the spirits in prison, that weredrowned in the days of Noah by the flood, because of their wickedness andabominations.  They had been in prison for a long time, and He went andpreached to them, 'that they might be judged according to men in theflesh, but live according to God in the spirit."  Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith,David Patten, and the apostles and Elders who have been true and faith-ful unto death have also gone to the spirits in prison in their day and timeand preached the Gospel of Christ to their fathers' houses and to thosewho are shut up in prison, and they are laboring there for the salvation ofthe children ofmen.  These are glorious principles--principles which theLatter-day Saints should not neglect while they have the privilege andpower.  As I said in the beginning, there isno calling a man can be calledto any greater than to have this right and privilege to go forth and savethe souls of men--save them by preaching the Gospel to them, by adminis-tering the ordinances of the house of God to them, that they may be pre-pared themselves to go into the kingdom of heaven and into a celestialglory.  There are three glories.  Paul in speaking upon that subject said"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of themoon, and anotherglory of the stars:  for one star differeth from another star in glory.  Soalso is the resurrection of the dead."  These glories over-shadow the whilehuman family.  Now, how much better it is for a man to receive theseordinances, that he may go where God and Christ dwell, which is thehighest glory!  But Jesus said in His day, "Strait is the gate, andnarrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;"while "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and may there bewhich go in thereat."  I think many times that we ourselves do not prizethe blessings that we enjoy and that are within our reach.  Our heartsshould be set upon the building up of the kingdom of God, the Zion ofGod, and the world of God, while we are here and have power to performthese things.  It is our duty as the Presidency and as Apostles, not onlyto labor ourselves, but to send forth the Elders of Israel to the nations ofthe earth to proclaim the Gospel.  Doors are open to-day among many ofthe nations for the spread of the Gospel of Christ, and to bring the peopleunto Christ, that they may receive these blessings.Brethren and sisters, this isd the way I feel this morning.  Of all peopleunder heavens we should be the best, the most righteous, and the most trueand faithful to God and to our fellow-men.  We should be true and faith-ful to the Holy Priesthood while we have it resting upon us, and true toour labors.  I rejoice at our condition today.  I rejoice at the peace that

 310   LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.has come unto us by the power and blessing of God.  I rejoice at thechange that is taking place in the world.  We are visited now by hundredsof people from thenations of the earth.  They are coming to behold theglory of Zion.  They come to enquire at our hands concerning variousmatters, and there is a very different feelings to what there was in formerdays toward us.  Brother John W. Taylor referred to our going to St.Louis and to Chicago.  Yes, I recollect very well when we went into JacksonCounty, Missouri.  My labors there have been alluded to.  When I went onmy first mission in 1834, I had to go through Jackson County on my way toArkansas.  It was just after our brethren hae been driven out.  I had togo and hide in the cornfields and in the brush during the day, and walkalong in the night, till I got through that country, for the lives of myselfand companion were in danger there.  The last time I went there, theMayor of Independence came out to meet us with a fine carriage.  He hadbut one arm, having lost the other in the army, but he gave us that arm andmade us welcome.  I could not help but feel the difference between then andwhen Iwent through there as a missionary.  These is a change taking place.Zion is going to rise and shine, and the glory of God will rest upon her.This people, if they do their duty, will fulfill and carry out these greatprinciples, and the eyes of the world will be turned toward Zion, and menwill come to enquire concerning the things of thekingdom of God.  We arein a good condition.  We are blessed of the Lord.  The Latter-day Saintshave never been so well off temporally.  Go into the houses of the Latter-day Saints, and you will find them in a better position than they have everbeen before.  These are the blessings of God, and we should prize thesethings and give God the glory for them, while we try to do our duty andmagnity our calling.  I want to say that I am in for salvation and foreternal life.  I have labored for that since I was a boy.  I have desired thegifts, and graces, and blessings manifest in the days of Jesus and HisApostles.  In my childhood I prayed God that I might live to see a prophetof somebody who could teach me the principles I read in the New Testa-ment.  The clergy of the day did not do it.  Nobody around there appearedto believe in such tings.  Well, I have lived to see prophets and apostles;I have lived to travel with them and to unite with them in thekingdomof God.  I have been in the apostleship fifty-eight years; I have been inthe Church sixty-three years.  My while life almost has been spent in thisChurch; and from the time I came into the Church I went on missionsand have never ceased altogether from that day to this.  I have alwaysrejoiced in this, and do to-day.  When I die and lay down my body, Ido not want anybody to rise up and say that I have neglected my dutyin trying to give him salvation as far as I could.  I have always rejoicedin preaching the Gospel; I have rejoiced in administering the ordi-ances of life and salvation at home and abroad, because i have known thatthis was the work of God, and I know it is to-day.I want to say now to the rising generation, gird up the loins of your minds, prepare yourselves, and realize you ahve a mission before you.Who are going to bear this kingdom off when we go to the grave?  Towhom does the Gof of Israel look to do this?  He looks to oursons and

There is nothinglike it on earth.  You may get the riches of the world; they pass away;but eternal life, celestial glory, a place with the righteous after resurrec-tion, with immortal bodies, are worth more than all this world can give.I have condifence to believe that the Latter-day Saints will carry out theseprinciples and magnify their calling before the Lord.  I have hopes thatour sons and daughtes will do the same.Brethren and sisters, I say, God bless you.  I am glad to meet with you.I rejoice in the Gospel, in the kingdom of God, and in the Holy Priesthood.I pray God to bless you, to open your eyes to see, and ears to hear, andyour hearts to understand.  I pray God to open your understanding, thatyou may comprehend the value and blessing of the Gospel that you havereceived and of the blessings of these temples and tabernacles in themidst of which you have the privilege of dwelling and receiving theordinances of God.  I pray that we may pursue that course that whenwe get on the other side of the veil we shall be satisfied with ourrecord.  We will find our history and our record these in the great libraryof the celestial kingdom of our God, and we will know what we have beendoing in this life.  If we do anything that is wrong we will be sorry forit.  We should repent of wrong and try to do better.  I pray that theSpirit of God may be with us to guide and direct us in our labors until weget through here, then when we pass awy we may be received in thekingdom of God.  We shall rejoice if we do right; for our eyes have notseen, or ears havenot heard, and it has never entered into the hearts ofthe children of men the glory that lies before the sons and daughters ofadm.  It is hidden from our eyes to-day, and will never be open to usuntil we enter into the presence of God and the Lamb.  Amen
