Welling ENDENTRY lower and dangerous ferry can be Entirely abandoned. As it is there are the following objections to it  1. It is so far away ^from the house on the ranch^ that the traveler has to waitâ€”often for hoursâ€”until his presence is discovered.  2. It is dangerous to cross on account of its close proximity to the mouth of Marble Canyon with its rapids.  3. At high water time when the water flows swiftly it is altogether an impracticable crossing.  The upper crossing would be much the better, but the horrible terrors of the steep, rocky and dangerous road over to it from the lower ford render it a frightful barrier. I personally know of several families who have gone around by rail rather than risk the possibility of having to  go over that dangerous road.  Hence the Ferry as it now is, is neither attractive to travelers, convenient or safe.  Now may I suggest the following for your Earnest consideration.

Dear Brethren:  A few days ago elder D. A. Damont, of this place, called in to see me about his mission to the Southern States to which he has been recently called.  He represents that since writing to you, he has considered his circumstances more carefully and desires to make the following representation:  He is owing for ^a^ new wagon and an interest in a saw mill to the amount of 30000 and besides that his home, which he values at $150000, is now under mortgage for $40000 which mortgage falls due in about one year from date. His crop of grain this season will not clear off these accounts, and while his creditors are willing to wait and he is willing to go now if it is thought best that he should I believe it would be better to allow him to stay at home for one year, in which time he thinks, and it appears reasonable to me, that he can pay off his obligations and leave his family in a more satisfactory condition.  After furnishing you with this information Bro. Damont is perfectly willing to leave the matter to your wisdome and will cheerfully abide your decission. Your Brother Geo. C.
