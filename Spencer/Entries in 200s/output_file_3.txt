Luke chap 18 v 8th To President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother On Sunday the 21st of December I was  visited by an Elder who told me that a proclaimation was comeing out and on the 11th of January I visited a small company of Saints and obtained a copy of the same which since then I have  read with deep interest. On the 6th page you say no individual will stand  I firmly believe and therefore I find it impossible to stand neutral. I cannot rest contented  without makeing some reply. Page 13 God has said that if the Gentiles do not repent and  come to the knowledge of the truth and cease to fight against Zion and also put away all  murder lying pride priestcraft whoredom and secret abomination they shall soon perish  from the earth and be cast down to hell. God hath also said that the time is at hand for  the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. On these two points of doctrine I feel desireous to speak. If the Gentiles are ^to^ put away these evil practices they must have some body to preach to them  exactly in the same manner as Jesus Christ did preach when he first made his public  appearance among men: and thes the Gentiles have not had that I am aware of since the  3rd century. Let the 5th 6th and 7th chapters of Matthew be brought upon the carpet and  carefully examined. And let us see if his first and chiefest sermon contains any thing  calculated to give political and heathen Governments hope that they should have any thing  to do in establishing the kingdom of God. Let my brethren the Latter day Saints or as  many of them as are in Office join with me in preaching or publishing to the Gentile world  the laws of Jesus Christ in their literas literal sense and free from corruption and error  This I say hath not been the practice of the gentile cleargy in my time for if ^it^ had I must  have heard it at some time ^or^ other within the space of three score years.   his Church a sample of laws that should be soficient for their guidance in all ages if they would receive and abide by them as they ought to do. To suppose that ^the^ moral precepts of Jesus Christ  as delivered in his sermon on the mountain is not soficient for all the moral purposes of  his disciples is to suppos a deficiency in the wisdom of God in sending Jesus Christ on  the errand he did send him. Those who make laws in oposition and contrary to the laws of Jesus  Christ and enforce them by the point of the bayonet while they call themselvs christians  virtueally says to their Maker "Thou art a fool thou dost not know so well as we do by what Laws the people ought to be governed." Two of the petitions in the prayer which our Lord composed  for the use of his disciples are noticed in this proclaimation and I ask leave to notice another of them. Forgive us our trespases (How and in what manner?) as we forgive them that trespas  against us. What are we not to be forgiven but upon this condition? Here the answer of Jesus  to this question. If ye forgive not men their trespases neither will your  He^a^venly Father forgive your trespases. This is intilligable language there is no quibbleing  page torn in this doctrine. This sort of Prayer it is clear to me was taught by the saviour to prevent  or hinder his Saints from praying blasphemy. But how do I forgive those who trespas  against me if as soon as they have do^ne^ so I fly to  But what does such practice imply? It implys something to this efect namely that Christianity  is a cheat played off upon the world and that it hath no foundation in truth. It gos to teach  that man knows better than God does what amount of chastisemen the wicked ought to receive  for their cruelty  ought to be inflicted. The laws of Jesus Christ are a part of t^h^e law of God so highly extoled in the  Hundred and nineteenth psalm for they came to man from God through the same Jesus Christ One of the laws that he delivered is as follows: What so ever ye would that men should do unto  you do ye also unto them. Here is an appeal to our reason and to the inward convictions of our own heart  If then our heart and our reason do testify that when we our selves do transgress the bounds of love  and actually trespas against our brother ^or^ sister as that perhaps we may for we are not perfect or not so  perfect as not to be liable to fall if I say our reason and our hearts do testify that in such a case we  would prefer punishment to forgiveness then indeed this last mentioned law of Jesus Christ will  allow people with this convi^c^tion to resist litteraly moral evil in other people   on the Globe. For if such a thing could be proved it would also prove that Christianity itself page torn is  nothing more than a jumble of absurdity confusion and self contradiction and Consequently  not worthy the attention of any reasonable man.

For in the year 1806 I first began to write in order to learn for myself  if any individual could be found among all the profesors of religion that would live up to and  honour the precepts of their great Master and now in 1846 I claim a portion of the 95th psalm  as being proved true by my own experiance. But I must decline this subject for the present and  turn to the Jews. You say the time is at hand for the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. Very well  I am willing for that also. And here the question arises How is this great work to be achieved?  Is it to be done by cant and quibble or is it to be done by the power of truth which cannot be over  come by any efort? I will now give my own view of the subject of 14 years standing.   of the Scribes and Pharisees. And at the beginning of the 24th Chapter we find him come out  of the temple and his disciples or some of them tryed to turn his atention to the beauty  of the Temple on the outside. And Jesus in reply said unto them See ye not all these things?  Verily I say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not  be thrown down. He then went to the mount of Olives and his disciples followed him to the  mount of Olives and there put a threefold question to him  when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy comeing and of the end of the  world. And Jesus begins his answer to their threefold question at the middle of the 4th verse  of this 24 chapter of Matthew and he continues it without any interruption by any other  speaker to the end of the 25 chapter. Full ninety and three verses or ninety three and a half  verses of the New Testament is ocupied with the answer which Jesus returned to  the question his disciples put to him  also that the question was put to him in the first person thus what shall be the sign of  comeing? But mark the grammer of his answer in the 94 verses every word of the 94  verses is in the 3rd person of grammer though the question is put to him in the 1st person.  Is it true then that Jesus Christ at this council meeting detemined to deceive and mislead  his disciples for they asked him about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation  but he did not tell them a word about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation?  As then it is as clear as language can make it that Jesus Christ never once told his disciples  that he should come again in person at the end of this wicked world I should like to know by  what means the  of the Latter day saints only but of the sects generally. The naked truth is this ^if^ my views  are clear that Jesus Christ abundantly foretold the comeing of some individual who  would be instrumental in convincing the Jews of their Infidelity and that to in strict  agreement with some parts of the Old Testament for the comeing of one is plainly set forth in the page torn  Book which Jesus Christ never answered to the discription of. If I had every Jew now liveing  upon the Globe standing before me at this time in one company and could speak loud  enough for all to here I would hold up the New Testament in the sight of the multitude and say: Look here ye Sons of Jacob Behold ye seed of Israel This Book contains the  best Prophecy of the comeing of your Deliverer and as soon as you allow this to be true  that same hour your political captivity is ended. And to the end of my life or while it  shall please Almighty God to hold me in existance so long will I defy every  Jew and every Christian Priest to deny this with true words upon their lips.

In speaking of the Amend- ment to the Federal Constitution, which is very likely to come up before the House, he is desirous to know our views concerning his action upon that question. Mr.  Gibson, it seems, suggested to him in the first place that he should remain neutral. Brother Caine says, however, that he has very decided views upon the subject, and he has outlined a speech that he might make upon the question that, he thinks, would be ENDENTRY  and to decide which, under the circumstances, is the better line for the Saints to come by.   you make mention, and from which you send us extracts, you will be better able to decide after seeing Maude, who can give you the information necessary concerning them and the power of our  friends to reach them. His presence in Washington will enable you to understand the situation much better than it would be possible to learn by letter or by telegram, as he can give you a knowledge of the influences which are at work and the ability of our friends to reach papers and persons that may be necessary to make our business successful.  I trust you have been able to see him and that your interviews have been satisfactory. We received  a dispatch from him after he reached Washington, in which he informed us that he had not yet met with you.  ENDENTRY  Franklin S. Richards have been sent in part. The dispatches requesting them found us in a bad position to supply that which he asked for. All our doc- uments were taken hurriedly out of the Historian Office and were not left in such an orderly manner as to enable anyone to readily find any document that might be needed. Not only did it require a thorough search of all papers, but unfortunately the  person who knew their whereabouts was not in the city. This has occasioned great delay. A batch of documents were sent yesterday; some more will be sent to-day, though we fear, from Brother Richards' dispatch, that those sent to-day will not be in time to answer his purpose. Our attorneys in the Legislature have been so busily employed that it was almost im- possible for them to spare the time at once to get up affidavits of the kind required. If they had had a little more time, they could have arranged better; but the Legislature being so near the close of its session necessarily compelled them to spend the greater part  ENDENTRY  Ans'd Mar. 20 —1888— end of sideways text   CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.

We can only repeat ENDENTRY  Congress and the country a better knowledge of the action of our Constitutional Convention, &amp;C. It would seem to us that this perhaps might be done by him to advantage. As you are on the ground, however, and can see all the reasons for and against such a  course, we think it better to submit this question to you.   the speech, if it could be made carefully and with a conservative tone. But there may be reasons, the weight of which we cannot fully realize here, for deem- ing such a course impolitic under present circumstances. You, doubtless, have opportunities by this time to consult with our friends. We think it would be well, therefore, for you to converse freely with them upon this subject and get their views concerning it. If they see no grave objection to a speech of this character, we certainly would be very much in favor of it. In our reply to Brother Caine, we have told ENDENTRY  present them with as good a silver  average  (for we have them).

I think it important that when needed we can have a quorum of our Council, so that the responsibility may be borne by the Quorum. Questions are constantly arising of an important character, and I do not wish any of us to be placed in a position where it could be said by absent ones that if they had been present they should have recommended a different policy. Besides, I think it due to the brethren that having the responsibility they should have the opportunity of giv- ing their views.

I am fully persuaded that our enemies would take advantage of it; and while it would be limited in its circulation and would reach but comparatively few hands, the com- ments made upon it and misrepresentations of it would be widely circulated. If an announcement of this kind is to be made at all from us, we are of the opinion that it would be better to come from Brother Caine on the floor of the House than from the columns of the    you any local news, much of which you can gain from the newspapers. ENDENTRY  have not had the most distant idea of doing any- thing, in any form, to hurt his influence, to deprive him of any credit, or to, in any manner, curtail him in any of his legitimate labors. It would have been a great pleasure to us to have seen him take such a  course in our transactions that we could have spoken with unqualified praise concerning his labors, and given him every credit to which he could be in the least degree entitled. If we fail in making him believe that these are our feelings, then we do not think we are to blame, though we are sorry to be so unfortun- ate, for these are our genuine feelings and they have been in all that we have said and done. But we have felt that while we were willing to accord him all this, he should also respect us in our place sufficiently to communicate to us the purposes for which he wished to obtain money and also the directions in which he intended to operate, not for any personal gratification to us, or to yield ENDENTRY  clippings which you mention in your last favor. Of course, if they are of no benefit to you there, it is not worth while paying for them; but if they are, the price for a clipping is not much more than would have to be paid for the paper containing it, if we had to buy it ourselves.

It seems to us that the requests we have made of Brother John W. have been very simple and that they should not have injured his feelings or wounded his pride. We certainly have not intended to ask any- thing more of him than is required of us by those who have entrusted funds in our keeping.   obtain direct communication with No. 3, and that you ENDENTRY  feel as you describe. His expressions concerning being left in the lurch or being crushed have no founda- tion in fact. There has been no such disposition manifested by the Committee towards him. We have treated him with all the consideration and respect that could be reasonably asked. Certainly we have  tried to treat him with more courtesy than we think we have received. If he will only reflect as he should do, he will see that there has been no manifestation on our part to do him the least injury, or to treat him in any way that should displease an honorable and upright man. The Committee certainly have ask- ed no more from him than they themselves are expected to perform. Money is placed in their hands; but they will have to account for its expendi- ture; and this is but reasonable. Confidence cannot be maintained in any other way.

We have made another appointment for to-morrow evening.   I (President Woodruff) spoke quite plainly to him con- cerning the position that you and the other brethren  were in at his house, and that some arrangement should be made about it; that his refusal to take pay for your board, &amp;C., placed you in a very delicate position. He made quite an explanation in reply to this; said that he had proposed to accept the pay on donation to the Fund, and he had also proposed that the expenses of the house be kept for one month and be divided proportionately. We asked him how this had resulted, and he said the month had not yet expired. He ENDENTRY  before the Senate Committee.

It is mission- ary work that has a direct influence upon our case, and in taking this course we do our duty and leave a responsibility upon them which they would not have to bear if it were not for the information that is thus imparted to them.
