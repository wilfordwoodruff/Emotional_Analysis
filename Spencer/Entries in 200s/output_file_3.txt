My last letter which you will receeve by the hand of Elder Turley was Dated Aug 10th 8 days since. I will inform you in few words  what I have been about since. We took the parting hand with Eldr Turley on the 11th for the last time untill we meet him in America. We  also spent several days in passing through the Glostershire churches and taking the parting hand with them which was truly an affecting scene  to see hundreds of friends or Saints which we had baptzed into the kingdom  flock around us and take us by the hand and weep as though they would break their hearts, appear as though they were taking their leave of their father to  see him no more, the many sensations of this kind which I have passed  through since I have been in England have been peculiar, to my feelings and clearly show me the Effect that the Everlasting gospel has upon the honest in heart and the meek of the Earth. We held a camp meeting on Sunday the 16th at the Leigh Gloucestershire which is the last meeting we have had with  the Saints, we Baptized 15 while there and ordained one Elder and two Priests. the two that we ordained Priests came 12 miles to hear us and they went  forward and was Baptized the first sermon and we confirmed and Ordained them at the same time, the work is progressing rapidly in that region, those churches  which I built up there now number about 900 all of which have embraced  the work in little more than 5 months they will No 1000 at the end of  6 months from the time that I first preached to the people in that region. 17th  we parted with the Saints at the Leigh and travled 5 miles to Cheltenham and  spent the night at a Temperance Hotel pop 40,000 (following is a short extract from my Journal) Aug 18th 1840 I took coach at Cheltenham at 9 oclock P.M. in company with Eldrr Kimball and G.

A Prussian traveller, citizen of Berlin was with us, and we  had much conversation with him, he had travled over Europe and Asia and many other parts of the world and he del^c^laired this to be the highest monument  and the grandest and most sublime prospect, that could be found upon the face of the Earth. As I Before said "this monument was Erected on the ground  whereon stood the parish church of St. Margaret, on the east side of fish street hill, in the ward of Bridge, in a square open to the street, to perpetuate the rememberance of the dredful fire on London, in  the year 1666. This fine peace of architecture is the design of that great genius Sir Christopher Wren. it is undoubtedly the finest modern column in the world, and in some respects may vie with the most famous  of Antiquity, being twenty four feet higher than Trajan’s Pillar at Rome." The following is inscribed  upon the monument (“In the year of Christ 1666, the second day of September eastward from hence at  the distance of 200 feet (the highth of this column) about midnight most terrible fire broke out  which driven on by a high wind not ownly wasted the adjacent parts, but also Pa Places vary remote with incredible noise and fury.

The ruins of  the city were 436 acres from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church and from the  North-east Gate along the city wall to Holborn Bridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it was  merciless, but to their lives vary favorable (ownly eight being lost) that it might in all things resemble  the last conflagation of the world. The destruction was sudden for in a small space of time, the  same city was seen flourishing and reduced to nothing. Three days after, when this fatal fire had baffled all human councils and endeavors the opinion of all, as it were, by the will of Heaven, it stoped and on evry side was extinguished.”) Damage done but the fire in all £10,730,500 or $53,652,500 dollars (the above quotation was written in Latin upon the monument) for further information enquire of John Lyman Smith who has a Pamphlet sent him by G.

The reverse however, has characterized the movements of the people by whom I am surrounded, the most intense anxiety, and Excitement prevailing ever since my arrival here. I have however strove to attend to the interests of my constituents, and kept aloof as much as possible from participating in any political squabbles. I may say, I have been treated by all parties during this Session, with respect, and in many instances marked courtesy, and thro' a variety of ways, my acquaintance among men of all classes is pretty Extensive, and tends to help me along materially in the discharge of my onerous duties.  I shall write Prest Young on Saturday by Pony with the news, and as you will receive the same before this reaches you, it will be useless to advert at length now, to the political movements, indeed, things are in some respects at a stand still, all eyes are turned to the Prest Elect – to solve the problem ENDENTRY was to leave For Frederickton which I had to take in an hour aftr  I got in the city so I had but little time to see St Johns.

I visited the place of the acc^t^ions and from the ball and shot Holes in the windows doors and Homes I wonder that many more were not killed it is supposed it will  be renewed. I took steemer and rode to Frederickton 100 miles up the St John River arived at 8 oclok I was still very lame and sore with my walking. I found  the country both sides of the St Johns River the most beautiful  farming country almost that I ever saw for so long a distance in so rough a country as the general face back in in the timber lands appears. I put at ^up^ at the Temperance Hotel in York Street. A stranger in a strange country. It rained most of the way up the river yet I stayed most  of the time on deck to view the country and to see the Salmon and Sturgeon  jump out of water.  18th I learned this morning that I could not  leave for Miramichi for 3 days, but musst remain there.

I will describe the stage one pairs of Horses was put onto the tongue of an open lumber Waggon with two seats in it the 1st seat was occupied by the drivers and Mr Frazier with their feet on the Mail Bag. I occupied the 2nd seat above making a driver and two passengers the Bottom of the Box ran out behind the waggon 4 feet upon which stood a large Heavy chest. next was another waggon with the long run under the first waggon and fastened to it with ropes the second waggon was loaded with wood and trunks And with this train of two waggons and lumber hitched behind two Horses we started to travel all day and all night through a forest country vary Hilly for 100 miles And when I herd the driver tell about getting through in 24 Hours I thought it would be more likely to take a week for I did not see how He was going to go out of a walk with such a train of cars behind him But I was soon undecieved and my eyes were opened for it was very Hilly and long Hills in many places and as soon as He came to the top of a steep Hill, His Horses could not Hold the two waggons if they fell ever so much disposed to so of course the ownly way was to run fast enough to keep out of the way of the waggons so by the time I had rode down a few long Hills with the Horses upon A keen run which speed they would not break untill they reach halfway to the top of the next Hill. I began to think to we should soon get through our journey but I thought it much more likely to end at the bottom of some tremendious precipice or off a bridge in some brook which were vary freequant on the road, thwax seal to End in Miramichi and that to before the light of anoth day. And in this way wax seal we went dashing down Hills, through gullies, and over bridges He Ho He ho like unt^i^lll midnight 21st l oclok in the Morning changed Horses, took tea, got in waggon. A fresh pair of Horses put into A run, down Hills, with two waggons at their Heels, the driver and his companion both sound asleep dark night, cannot see the road, Nothing but God or Angels can guide us. Horses go whare they please, and probably it is better for the driver to be asleep than awake for they may keep the road. My wife need never to call me an unlucky man if I ever live to see day light again. Phebe would you not like to take a ride with me what an interesting Journey I am Having. I am telling the truth just as it is we rode all night long in this way to broad day light and down evry Hill from 10 rods to quarter of a mile long the Horses would go upon a run and the drivers and Frazier slept for two hours after day light for which I was glad to see. we came near being dashed to atoms runing down a Hill after day light. I could not tell so much about the danger in the night but this child did not sleep untill After day light I then caught myself noding a few times but they were short naps.

Luke chap 18 v 8th To President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother On Sunday the 21st of December I was  visited by an Elder who told me that a proclaimation was comeing out and on the 11th of January I visited a small company of Saints and obtained a copy of the same which since then I have  read with deep interest. On the 6th page you say no individual will stand neutral and this  I firmly believe and therefore I find it impossible to stand neutral. I cannot rest contented  without makeing some reply. Page 13 God has said that if the Gentiles do not repent and  come to the knowledge of the truth and cease to fight against Zion and also put away all  murder lying pride priestcraft whoredom and secret abomination they shall soon perish  from the earth and be cast down to hell. God hath also said that the time is at hand for  the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. On these two points of doctrine I feel desireous to speak. If the Gentiles are ^to^ put away these evil practices they must have some body to preach to them  exactly in the same manner as Jesus Christ did preach when he first made his public  appearance among men: and thes the Gentiles have not had that I am aware of since the  3rd century. Let the 5th 6th and 7th chapters of Matthew be brought upon the carpet and  carefully examined. And let us see if his first and chiefest sermon contains any thing  calculated to give political and heathen Governments hope that they should have any thing  to do in establishing the kingdom of God. Let my brethren the Latter day Saints or as  many of them as are in Office join with me in preaching or publishing to the Gentile world  the laws of Jesus Christ in their literas literal sense and free from corruption and error  This I say hath not been the practice of the gentile cleargy in my time for if ^it^ had I must  have heard it at some time ^or^ other within the space of three score years.  Nothing is more evident to me than that it was the intention of Jesus to give and to leave with  his Church a sample of laws that should be soficient for their guidance in all ages if they would receive and abide by them as they ought to do. To suppose that ^the^ moral precepts of Jesus Christ  as delivered in his sermon on the mountain is not soficient for all the moral purposes of  his disciples is to suppos a deficiency in the wisdom of God in sending Jesus Christ on  the errand he did send him. Those who make laws in oposition and contrary to the laws of Jesus  Christ and enforce them by the point of the bayonet while they call themselvs christians  virtueally says to their Maker "Thou art a fool thou dost not know so well as we do by what Laws the people ought to be governed." Two of the petitions in the prayer which our Lord composed  for the use of his disciples are noticed in this proclaimation and I ask leave to notice another of them. Forgive us our trespases (How and in what manner?) as we forgive them that trespas  against us. What are we not to be forgiven but upon this condition? Here the answer of Jesus  to this question. If ye forgive not men their trespases neither will your Father fo He^a^venly Father forgive your trespases. This is intilligable language there is no quibbleing  page torn in this doctrine. This sort of Prayer it is clear to me was taught by the saviour to prevent  or hinder his Saints from praying blasphemy. But how do I forgive those who trespas  against me if as soon as they have do^ne^ so I fly to ha heathen ^laws^ for shelter and revenge? But what does such practice imply? It implys something to this efect namely that Christianity  is a cheat played off upon the world and that it hath no foundation in truth. It gos to teach  that man knows better than God does what amount of chastisemen the wicked ought to receive  for their cruelty th to their fellow creatures—and also knows better when such chastisement  ought to be inflicted. The laws of Jesus Christ are a part of t^h^e law of God so highly extoled in the  Hundred and nineteenth psalm for they came to man from God through the same Jesus Christ One of the laws that he delivered is as follows: What so ever ye would that men should do unto  you do ye also unto them. Here is an appeal to our reason and to the inward convictions of our own heart  If then our heart and our reason do testify that when we our selves do transgress the bounds of love  and actually trespas against our brother ^or^ sister as that perhaps we may for we are not perfect or not so  perfect as not to be liable to fall if I say our reason and our hearts do testify that in such a case we  would prefer punishment to forgiveness then indeed this last mentioned law of Jesus Christ will  allow people with this convi^c^tion to resist litteraly moral evil in other people  But I trust I have too much good sense about ^me^ to pretedd pretend to believe that such a man ex^i^steth  on the Globe. For if such a thing could be proved it would also prove that Christianity itself page torn is  nothing more than a jumble of absurdity confusion and self contradiction and Consequently  not worthy the attention of any reasonable man.

For in the year 1806 I first began to write in order to learn for myself  if any individual could be found among all the profesors of religion that would live up to and  honour the precepts of their great Master and now in 1846 I claim a portion of the 95th psalm  as being proved true by my own experiance. But I must decline this subject for the present and  turn to the Jews. You say the time is at hand for the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. Very well  I am willing for that also. And here the question arises How is this great work to be achieved?  Is it to be done by cant and quibble or is it to be done by the power of truth which cannot be over  come by any efort? I will now give my own view of the subject of 14 years standing.  In the 23rd of Matthew we find Jesus in the temple complaining or finding fault with the conduct  of the Scribes and Pharisees. And at the beginning of the 24th Chapter we find him come out  of the temple and his disciples or some of them tryed to turn his atention to the beauty  of the Temple on the outside. And Jesus in reply said unto them See ye not all these things?  Verily I say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not  be thrown down. He then went to the mount of Olives and his disciples followed him to the  mount of Olives and there put a threefold question to him privately saying Tell us  when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy comeing and of the end of the  world. And Jesus begins his answer to their threefold question at the middle of the 4th verse  of this 24 chapter of Matthew and he continues it without any interruption by any other  speaker to the end of the 25 chapter. Full ninety and three verses or ninety three and a half  verses of the New Testament is ocupied with the answer which Jesus returned to  the question his disciples put to him privately on the mount of Olives. Let it be understood  also that the question was put to him in the first person thus what shall be the sign of thy  comeing? But mark the grammer of his answer in the 94 verses every word of the 94  verses is in the 3rd person of grammer though the question is put to him in the 1st person.  Is it true then that Jesus Christ at this council meeting detemined to deceive and mislead  his disciples for they asked him about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation  but he did not tell them a word about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation?  As then it is as clear as language can make it that Jesus Christ never once told his disciples  that he should come again in person at the end of this wicked world I should like to know by  what means the peoy people of this generation came by such a belief. I am not here speaking  of the Latter day saints only but of the sects generally. The naked truth is this ^if^ my views  are clear that Jesus Christ abundantly foretold the comeing of some individual who  would be instrumental in convincing the Jews of their Infidelity and that to in strict  agreement with some parts of the Old Testament for the comeing of one is plainly set forth in the page torn  Book which Jesus Christ never answered to the discription of. If I had every Jew now liveing  upon the Globe standing before me at this time in one company and could speak loud  enough for all to here I would hold up the New Testament in the sight of the multitude and say: Look here ye Sons of Jacob Behold ye seed of Israel This Book contains the  best Prophecy of the comeing of your Deliverer and as soon as you allow this to be true  that same hour your political captivity is ended. And to the end of my life or while it  shall please Almighty God to hold me in existance so long will I defy every  Jew and every Christian Priest to deny this with true words upon their lips.  And now Brother Woodruff I invite you to call me to order if I have said any thing  contrary to the word of God. I court enquiry and desire th to be tryed by the Bible for the  Principles I hold.

He says there is a chance of getting cattle up near the Cherrokee nation for very much less, than they can be got through this rege^i^eoin, he thinks they can be got, so as to cost only about $35 a yol^k^k^e^ at the Bluffs. That is they can be purchased in the Cherrokee country for about $20 per yk  and the expense of driving andc would not be above 30 or 35 $ andc andc.

Elders Wilson, Ward, Hedlock, and M Holmes were  present in the office when I opened and read it and they all  much rejoiced in its contents. I shall publish most of it  in the next Millenniel Star for I know it will do the Saints good generally to hear the News from America.

We have of late  rented one of the most respectable Houses in Liverpool for  three years for our printing, Emigration, Joint Stock associ- ation andc. I hope Br Grant you will make up your mind  to come to Liverpool as soon as you can get your Endowment  we have now but 7 or 8 American Elders in all to labor  away 10 or 12 thousand Saints so it keeps me quite busy  to answer a peak pack of letters each day that come to me for  council for one thing or another the work is on the increase through the British dominons. If war will ownly keep  off a few years we shall send many thousands of Saints  to Zion. I have printed 3000 Books of Doctrines and Covenants and secured the copywright of the same. Greenlow with the  Rigdon party laid a plot in pitsburgh to secretly  stereotype that work and come to London and Enter the work  and steal it out of our hands but the God of Heaven who  revealed secrets made this known to me in time put it and  leave the work before them which gives us the privleges of printing it and sending it to two hundred Million of people in  England East Indes and all the world whare Brittania sweeps her scepter.

We have appointed a Standing Committee from the members of the Parent Society, in each of these departments. Their names are as follows:  ON HORSES,  H. J. FAUST, Chairman, PETER NEBEKER, HEBER P.

Almost any information you may desire on these subjects can be readily obtained through these Commmittees, by placing yourselves in correspondence with them.  From time to time, the Society will furnish articles treating on these various subjects, through the Deseret News and Salt Lake Herald, whose Editors have courteously extended this privilege to us.  We respectfully suggest and urge the immediate organization of AUXILIARY SOCIETIES in each of your Wards, and that, through their Corresponding Secretaries, you report to us the details of your organizations, with your successes and any general information you can obtain, that will aid in the furtherance of the cause.  Some of our Agents have gone, and others are going, to the STATES and CANADAS to make purchases of Choice Selec- tions of STOCK, BEES, FISH, FOWLS, etc. We would recommend the judgment and fidelity of these Agents to you, and intimate that, in our opinion, you cannot find better opportunities to send for good BULLS, HEIFERS, STALLIONS, SHEEP, BEES, FISH, etc.  It is well understood that large numbers can be bought and freighted through at a much cheaper rate than where but a few are ordered at one time.  Those who prefer, can send their orders through, and make their remittances to, ELDER R. L. CAMPBELL, Trea- surer of said Parent Society.  We earnestly trust that you will take hold of these matters with a spirit and energy worthy of the cause, and thereby promote the General Interests and Welfare of the Saints.

Dear Brother Joseph F.:  We have just received a very inter- esting communication, under date of the 3rd inst., from Brother John T. Caine. In speaking of the Amend- ment to the Federal Constitution, which is very likely to come up before the House, he is desirous to know our views concerning his action upon that question. Mr.  Gibson, it seems, suggested to him in the first place that he should remain neutral. Brother Caine says, however, that he has very decided views upon the subject, and he has outlined a speech that he might make upon the question that, he thinks, would be ENDENTRY considerable certainty as to the merits of the two lines and to decide which, under the circumstances, is the better line for the Saints to come by.  Respecting the newspapers of which you make mention, and from which you send us extracts, you will be better able to decide after seeing Maude, who can give you the information necessary concerning them and the power of our  friends to reach them. His presence in Washington will enable you to understand the situation much better than it would be possible to learn by letter or by telegram, as he can give you a knowledge of the influences which are at work and the ability of our friends to reach papers and persons that may be necessary to make our business successful.  I trust you have been able to see him and that your interviews have been satisfactory. We received  a dispatch from him after he reached Washington, in which he informed us that he had not yet met with you.  ENDENTRY The documents sent for by Brother  Franklin S. Richards have been sent in part. The dispatches requesting them found us in a bad position to supply that which he asked for. All our doc- uments were taken hurriedly out of the Historian Office and were not left in such an orderly manner as to enable anyone to readily find any document that might be needed. Not only did it require a thorough search of all papers, but unfortunately the  person who knew their whereabouts was not in the city. This has occasioned great delay. A batch of documents were sent yesterday; some more will be sent to-day, though we fear, from Brother Richards' dispatch, that those sent to-day will not be in time to answer his purpose. Our attorneys in the Legislature have been so busily employed that it was almost im- possible for them to spare the time at once to get up affidavits of the kind required. If they had had a little more time, they could have arranged better; but the Legislature being so near the close of its session necessarily compelled them to spend the greater part  ENDENTRY sideways text Rec'd Mar. 19, 1888 Ans'd Mar. 20 —1888— end of sideways text  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.

Dear Brother Joseph F.:  Your esteemed favor of  the 7th inst. has just been received, containing a state- ment of the amount of funds left in the hands of  Brother John T. Caine, and many particulars which are very interesting to us concerning your movements there.  We are not surprised at what we hear from you respecting the action of Brother John W.  Young; but we regret very much that he should feel to draw off or to be wounded at the course that we have taken with him. We can only repeat ENDENTRY of benefit to our cause and be the means of giving Congress and the country a better knowledge of the action of our Constitutional Convention, andC. It would seem to us that this perhaps might be done by him to advantage. As you are on the ground, however, and can see all the reasons for and against such a  course, we think it better to submit this question to you.  Naturally speaking, we should say, make the speech, if it could be made carefully and with a conservative tone. But there may be reasons, the weight of which we cannot fully realize here, for deem- ing such a course impolitic under present circumstances. You, doubtless, have opportunities by this time to consult with our friends. We think it would be well, therefore, for you to converse freely with them upon this subject and get their views concerning it. If they see no grave objection to a speech of this character, we certainly would be very much in favor of it. In our reply to Brother Caine, we have told ENDENTRY Silver m^M^ine the (Emma not Excepted) we will present them with as good a silver l^L^ode as the average Lads of ^N^evada can produce (for we have them). b^B^ut see the money in the i^I^ron business The ambition of the Officers and Stock holders of the Utah Iron Mining Company is to be able to not only compete for the local Iron trade of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast but to claim a n^N^iche for f^F^ame in the great National c^C^entenial Temple to be Erected in  the city of Phili^a^delphia in^A^D 1876 for the best Quality of American Iron and Steel.

Your ENDENTRY of their time in that body, or great injury might be done by hasty and ill-considered legislation.  I have had a quorum of the Twelve within reach now for some little time past. I think it important that when needed we can have a quorum of our Council, so that the responsibility may be borne by the Quorum. Questions are constantly arising of an important character, and I do not wish any of us to be placed in a position where it could be said by absent ones that if they had been present they should have recommended a different policy. Besides, I think it due to the brethren that having the responsibility they should have the opportunity of giv- ing their views. We had a meeting last night; there were present nine of the Twelve—myself, Brothers M.  Thatcher, H. J. Grant.  Respecting ex-Senator Pomeroy, you will learn, doubtless, considerable from Maude and how far he can be trusted.  ENDENTRY him that we should correspond with you upon the subject, and that we desired him to consult with you and to be governed by your suggestions and counsel, whether to make the speech or not.  The article which Brother Penrose sent to  us, I am clearly of the opinion, should not be pub- lished at the present time. I am fully persuaded that our enemies would take advantage of it; and while it would be limited in its circulation and would reach but comparatively few hands, the com- ments made upon it and misrepresentations of it would be widely circulated. If an announcement of this kind is to be made at all from us, we are of the opinion that it would be better to come from Brother Caine on the floor of the House than from the columns of the News.  We write this without stopping to give you any local news, much of which you can gain from the newspapers. ENDENTRY what we have said several times before, that we have not had the most distant idea of doing any- thing, in any form, to hurt his influence, to deprive him of any credit, or to, in any manner, curtail him in any of his legitimate labors. It would have been a great pleasure to us to have seen him take such a  course in our transactions that we could have spoken with unqualified praise concerning his labors, and given him every credit to which he could be in the least degree entitled. If we fail in making him believe that these are our feelings, then we do not think we are to blame, though we are sorry to be so unfortun- ate, for these are our genuine feelings and they have been in all that we have said and done. But we have felt that while we were willing to accord him all this, he should also respect us in our place sufficiently to communicate to us the purposes for which he wished to obtain money and also the directions in which he intended to operate, not for any personal gratification to us, or to yield ENDENTRY I see no objections to your paying for the clippings which you mention in your last favor. Of course, if they are of no benefit to you there, it is not worth while paying for them; but if they are, the price for a clipping is not much more than would have to be paid for the paper containing it, if we had to buy it ourselves.  With love to yourself, Brothers John W. Young, L. J. Nuttall, and Geo. F.

It seems to us that the requests we have made of Brother John W. have been very simple and that they should not have injured his feelings or wounded his pride. We certainly have not intended to ask any- thing more of him than is required of us by those who have entrusted funds in our keeping.  We are glad that you have been able to obtain direct communication with No. 3, and that you ENDENTRY We regret that Brother John W. Young should feel as you describe. His expressions concerning being left in the lurch or being crushed have no founda- tion in fact. There has been no such disposition manifested by the Committee towards him. We have treated him with all the consideration and respect that could be reasonably asked. Certainly we have  tried to treat him with more courtesy than we think we have received. If he will only reflect as he should do, he will see that there has been no manifestation on our part to do him the least injury, or to treat him in any way that should displease an honorable and upright man. The Committee certainly have ask- ed no more from him than they themselves are expected to perform. Money is placed in their hands; but they will have to account for its expendi- ture; and this is but reasonable. Confidence cannot be maintained in any other way. We owe it to ourselves and our future reputations that we should be able to  render a strict account of all that passes through our hands, so that no suspicion can arise as to our  ENDENTRY sideways text Rec'd Apr. 28, 1888. ans'd Apr. 30 —1888— end of sideways text  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.

Dear Brother Joseph F.:  Your esteemed favor of the 17th inst. has been received and perused with much interest. You have been very careful to give us full details of affairs with you, which have been very satisfactory, as from your letters we have gained an excellent idea of the situation. Your position has not been an en- viable one, still we think you have got along excellently.  The information which you communicated to us enables us to understand the position assumed by Brother John W.

It will doubtless be to advantage if you can get a more complete understanding of the obligations that have been assumed concerning Gov. C. F. Black. We agree with the brethren in thinking that you should still retain McDonald, Bright, and Fay, on the terms which have been agreed upon.  The telegraph has brought us informa- tion concerning the result of Baskin's argument before the Committee. We were pleased to receive this from you and to see in the Herald and the News the  public announcement, from private dispatches sent to these papers, of what had taken place. It will be gratifying to the entire people to read the results of  his attempt to poison the minds of the Committee against Utah. Taken as a whole, so far as we have been able to learn from your letters and dispatches and all that has come to hand, we have no reason ENDENTRY management of funds. In asking him to do the  same, we have as much regard for his honor as we have for our own. We know that it is the only way that we can take to inspire confidence and to remove feelings of distrust. We sincerely hope that he will see the propriety of the request that we have made, and that he will join heartily with you in your labor and manifest that confidence in making known his plans that you desire.  My health is good, as well as that of all the brethren, so far as I know. The weather has been somewhat wintry since the last of February. With love to yourself, to Brothers Young, Gibbs, in which the brethren join,  I remain Your Brother,  W Woodruff  sideways text Wilford Woodruff Rec'd Mar. 12, 1888 Ans'd Mar. 13 —1888— end of sideways text ENDENTRY telegraphed with some degree of freedom, and trust that you have been kept advised to your satisfaction.  We heard with great regret concerning the  failure of the Huntington Company to keep your contract. It seems strange that Mr. Curtis should not have known of the intention to make this change early enough to have not made such a contract as he did. The general hope is that you have been able to make satisfactory arrangements with the Guion Co. The feelings of the brethren are very strongly in favor of that Company, as we know your own are. Bro Geo. Teasdale has written a number of letters upon the subject of maintaining our old relations with the Guion Co. and seemed to be greatly exercised over the danger there appeared to be of our connection with it being broken.  We have been much embarrassed by the division of views which appear to exist between our legal counsel. From your reports the attorneys there seem to be united in thinking that Sheets' case is not a good one on which to appeal. The attorneys here are all united in thinking that it is a good case.

Through having to attend a meeting of the City Council, he did not keep his appointment by three-quarters of an hour. We stayed together till 11 o'clock and then had to break up somewhat abruptly to return to our quarters or we might have been kept hours longer. We have made another appointment for to-morrow evening.  We had a very plain talk with him. I (President Woodruff) spoke quite plainly to him con- cerning the position that you and the other brethren  were in at his house, and that some arrangement should be made about it; that his refusal to take pay for your board, andC., placed you in a very delicate position. He made quite an explanation in reply to this; said that he had proposed to accept the pay on donation to the Fund, and he had also proposed that the expenses of the house be kept for one month and be divided proportionately. We asked him how this had resulted, and he said the month had not yet expired. He ENDENTRY to be discouraged at the results of this investigation before the Senate Committee. On the contrary, it is very encouraging to know that there has been such a clear exposition of the truth, and evidence so incontro- vertible given concerning the conduct of officials in this Territory and other matters pertaining to the general situation.  The visits which are being made by the brethren to the leading men, as we have often said, cannot fail to be of great good. It is mission- ary work that has a direct influence upon our case, and in taking this course we do our duty and leave a responsibility upon them which they would not have to bear if it were not for the information that is thus imparted to them. It may be that this course, in some instances, will only make those who ^are^ disposed to endeavor to thwart us more active in their operations; but it will certainly raise up many friends, modify prejudice, and dissipate much of the ENDENTRY This division appears unfortunate. We have sent Bro. you might be in New York) giving him the views of our attorneys here and leaving the matter for the decision of the attorneys at Washington. Under the circumstances,  we think this the best we can do, as time is so short.  There is another question underlying all this, which we have had forced upon us, and that is, If No. 5's view is correct concerning the probable decision of U. S. Supreme Court respecting the constitutionality of the law, is it a wise thing for us to push our case to such a decision? Some attorneys here favor doing this, even if the decision should be adverse. But it is a matter that should be very well considered in all its bearings, and on this account we telegraphed you the other evening to hear from you what the united wishes and views of yourselves and our friends would be upon this question.
