 all be restored again.— Paul says I die da^i^ly brother Joseph says that he actually   died and was raised to life again— says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often   killed him and he came to life again— if so Willford why may not our little   Sarah be raised to life again— He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new   things this season.— There has been quite a number of deaths in Commerce   the past season I believed that I mentioned some of them in my last   letter to you Seymour Brunson, he was buried under armes— bishop he said that   brother D. Patten was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for   he needed him— likewise bishop Partridge is dead and his wife is married again to   father Huntingdon who lost his wife last fall – Mother Beanam— father John Jo   Joseph Smith the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around   him and blessed them and appointed Hiram Patriarch in his stead— There are   many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be   interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them.   such as some of the brethren's going among the Indians, I saw two of them   on the 2nd of this month and they said the prospects were good - last April   there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.— I have   not heard from Main or Connecticut since I wrote you last. - Did you   know that brother Ilus in N. Y. was married— Brother Dwite Webster   came here in june and went to the south with brother Smoot &   expects to spend the winter in Ten. brother Smoot has ordained him an   elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great pro  ficiency in the ministry— brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends   his respects to you Sister Smoot says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book   and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.    Brother John Herrett has been walking in your steps even on the fox islands   with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again   and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was   there— sister Jane Herrett say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had   a letter from her— I have lately seen sister Bently she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says   give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with   all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum   that it may not turn with her as it did with brother Pratts first wife in her   last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earth  she wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has n[one]    I [page torn] you to get your portrait painted if you can conveniently— a[page torn]  if you [page torn] [ca]n get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and [page torn]  cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper the[page torn]   here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along here— brother   Kimball was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he   left them. I have seen sister Moon sister Sutton and another sister from Eng I   have forgotten her name they were from Preston they have seen you all.   I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were   much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and   all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.    19th Yesterday Sunday, we had an interesting sermon we had an interesting  subjec upon the living's being baptized for the dead it was made so plain that none   could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents   and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had ra  ther you would do it than any person living.— Sister Swasey one of my good   neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants   him to come home for my sake. I am now at father Clarks and think I shall   stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing   can call on brother William Clark who wrote to you in my other letter makeing   a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you   come home, He is a fine young man— belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest   son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with you— therefore   give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our   babe an interest in your prayrs. I fell anxious to see my presents you spoke of   in your last letter— Ah! what shall I do when those little shoes come for Sarah   I don't know sometimes how to bear her loss it seames as though I cannot endure   it, but I must stop for it seems line a neverending subject for me to speak or   write on. Sister Young and Kimbal received some very pretty presents I saw   them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account   of their comeing from their husbands – If you could get some articles of clothing for   your family it would be quite acceptable— the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y.  apostatized in about 2 weeks after so sister Stone told me from N. Y. Sarah   Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she   is in Commerce.— Aphia Woodman has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking   her advice and mine about coming west with Milton she is about 60 miles east of   father Carters with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the   brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that   he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this   fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go. Brother Johnathan

 Sept 19th 1839  Lovely-street as you named the place when here    Dear Willford    After waightining waiting 5 long weeks after you left me to  hear from you I take my pen although in a feeble state and on the bed  as you will perceive from my writing. I let Sarah stay at brother Smoots  8 days after you left then she came home well and fleshy and bright she continued well  about 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was.  we were then in Montrose and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sick  about there so that brother and sister Smoot came out and mooved us to their  house and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house was  unfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose.  we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getti  ng better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of your  health after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who said  that you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you any  way. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done before  I think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something has  happened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel better  in the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first time  without a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think that  I am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise my  house I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I am  able to go into it their has been some talk of sister Tailor's going in with  me as she had to move out of brother Youngs house she went into my room  with sister Pratt while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to come  out into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family you  left with me Oh! dear! if I had expected the time had been long that I   should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come home  for I could not have staid in the house with any contentment— but  thank the Lord I have not for the frirst moment wished you at home  since you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success on  your mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spi  ritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to pres  erve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the love  and fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministry    I hope to do better next time 
 Yes I even begin to look forth for the day when I hope and trust that I  shall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord know  ing his calling although it I think it the greatest sacrafice that I could  make to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earth  but I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raise  me from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and Sarah^ untill thy return which is  my sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of grace  for we need as much grace to stand at this time of trial there are not  enough well people in Montrose to take care of the sick therefore  they suffer for want of attention—much the same in Commerce  although some have died there—and none in Montrose save a  number of children brother Pratts was one of the number— well  when you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in Quincy  and it continues verry sickly there yet— brother Lane has lost both  of his children. brother Warren Smiths wife is dead some of your  Southern acquaintance—brother Jeremiah Murphy has been here from  Tennessee and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that you  have learned the fate of our Island friends as I heared that you went  through Rochester was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeing  them. I received a book of brother Taylor's writing from Springfield  with your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see that  I received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heath  was generally good accept sister Foss who was quite feeble and had been  for 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with her  in his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you and  the letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ called and see  brother Ilus in N.Y. they feared that you would not know that he was  there. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted me  to come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wanted  you to call there on your return from England— Sister Foss would be  much pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month for  they will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and read  it with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some lines  in your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissing  the letter. Shshe often calls pa-pa-pa- verry loud—dont you hear her. If  you have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be much  better for you. I have been weighting to receive a a letter from you before I wrote  but feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y. 
 I verry much covet the long time that you have to journey before you get to  N.Y. wish you could have spent the time at home. I would have written you  a few of my sick bed reflections but do not feal able. Sister Smoot &  Jemima wishes to be remembered to you. they with shown brother Smoot have  shown us every kindness in every kindness in their power. Sister Taylor and  and her little girl are quite sick. Please give my best respects to brother  Tailor. I know that this writing is verry bad but I think that you will excuse  it when you learn that it was all written on my knee in the bed not  being able to sit up. I shall give up the remainder of this sheet to brother Smoot not  being able to fill it myself. With much love I remain yours  Willford Woodruff Phebe W. Woodruff    dont let this scrawl be seen neither writing or spelling Give my respects to brother Ilus   I liked to have met with a loss in my sickness but have not yet.    Elder W. Woodruff asteemed  friend & friend brother I gladly imbrace the  oppertunity that now offers me of writing  you a few lines by way of compliment  altho writen on my knee in hast by reaso[n] [page torn]  of the press of bu[si]ness that is now waiti[ng] [page torn]  on me. I beleave that things remane much  as they was when you left. Sickness prevailes  and all buness seemes to have stoped for the present    Perhaps it may be said that the presidency  has bought upper Commerce but what they give  for it I cannot say deffinetly. I would also informe  you that Govner Lucus of Ioway has sent  dow an exepress for Joseph and he is gone to see him  but what his buness is I persum is not known  It might be edefying or grattifying to you to  informe you that the fary at Commerce is  now in the hands of the bishops as I am cred  bly informed and President Rigdon is fast  recvering from a serious attact of sickness  you have the first interest in my prayrs—  most fervent, and I desire an interest in yours  I am sir as ever your most)  affecttionet Brother— ) A.O Smoot 
 Montrose Iowa  Sept 29    Mr Willford Woodruff  Citty of N.Y.  N.Y.    (Please forward this)    Phebe – Sept 19th 1839  Answerd [wax seal] Oct. 23[rd] 1839 
 Lee Montrose Lee County Iowa Territory Sept 8th 1840    My Dear Willford,    With pleasure I seat myself at this time to   acknowledge the reception of your kind letter which came to hand 10 days since  and I should have answered it immedately after its reception had it not been that my  babe was quite sick but he is better now I had been an[x]iously looking for a letter from you   for a long time and to my greate satisfaction received it from the hand of a brother, brought   by some of the brethren from Eng. on the 27th of Aug. 4 families arrived in Commerce from  Eng. and report says that 30 families more stopped in Cincinata Ohio for a little season  to labour and obtain more means to bring them here. I was truly glad that you recei  ved that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verry  an^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you of  ten I get quite uneasey — this is the 7th letter I have sent you since you left N N.Y. I have  taken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have   not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like your  mamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then   in May then June then July then this in Sept — the April letter I sent by brother O. Hyde   and J. E. Page, who who started soon after the April conference on a mission to the ^Jews^ via  of Eng and the one in july I sent by brother L. Snow containing an acount of Sarah  Emma death he expected to go d^i^rect to Eng. and I hope you have received that one this  time, one I directed to you in Liverpool in the care of J. Taylor thinking you would be more   likely to get it. You say you have sent me 4 letters since you arrived in Eng. I   have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others much  satisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and I  with them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is   blessing you labours and the brethren's there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the   time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames   to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon   as the Lord^'s will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vine  yard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day   and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the time  to be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a   severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little   dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and little brother whome she  tenderly loved, she d there was quite a number of the brethren and sisters accompanyed me but  it was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa,   for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and   troubles of this life. I have not heard from father Carter or father Woodruffs house  hold for sometime, but lately learned by a letter from br. D. Webster that Eunice had late   ly received a letter from you and that she had been unwell but was better, the others   were well br. Webster went to the south in june in company with br. Smoot as far   as Tennessee he makes good progress in the work and is pleased with his calling   br he thinks of spending the winter in the south if so he will be ordained an eld. and   have charge over the churches there, thus writes br. Smoot to his wife and says he   and br W. has baptized 15 he (Smoot) is soon expected home and will bring his mother   in law McMeanes with him he and his wife send their respects to you likewise   br Albert Smith and rejoices in the progress of the work with you also br. S. Smith   and wife. Br. D. Webster spent a week with me in june I suppose you know  of the engagement between him and sister E. Woodruff he told me of it himselfe when  he was here. I think him to be a fine man and will make a worthy companion   he wrote some in a letter that I was writing to you when he was here.    The siskness in Montrose and Commerce is not so greate as it was last season  but there has quite a number died this season some of which I know Seymour Brunson,   widow Beman, J. Holme's wife, J.P. Green's wife, Bishop Partridge, and daughter,  S. Rigdon and father Joseph Smith are verry low, and many others that I do not  know I had our little Sarah buried in Commerc and have got a picket fence around  it ^her grave^ painted white and trimed with black — I miss her company much. If you  have not received my letters there are many things that contained in them you  would like to hear our family matters &c. In my Jan letter I told you about my   temporal affairs and situation and I have just written you a letter which I  shall not send you but shall keep it for you when you come home come home   those are pleaseing words shall I ever realize them I hope to. I am now at   father Clark's where I have been since last Dec. they are verry kind to me and have been   ever since I have been there he makes me welcome to stay here untill you come home there   is a branch of the church here of about 50 and they are well united Ephraim Luce belongs   to it and family N. Thoma's and family they wish to be remembered to you. Stephen   Luce lives in Commerce - one part of it is call Nauvoo it is building up verry fast indeed   they have appointed a stake on the west side of the river and Nashvill is the place   appointed to build up a citty. I have seen brother William Benbow from Eng. where   you made it your home for 2 months when they were there and the little girls that used  to sleep with you, or the man of God as they called you, they were as much pleased to see me as  though we had always been acquainted I had a verry pleaseing visit with them they   
 seem much pleased with their situation they appear to be worthy people I think mu  much of them perhapse more for haveing been acquainted with you, he said you told  him you thought you should see him in Amrica in about one year from that   time which was last April I count the time verry particularly up to that time  O my dear W. must I wait longer than that time to see you, br. Joseph says that the Lord does  not require a man to be from his family more than a year at one time. brother   O. H Hyde and J.E. Page have started on a mission to the Jews have been gone about 5 months   and have not got near N.Y. yet they are going to Eng. and then to constan  tinople, - if you do not get the times and seasons I would just say that there  is verry interesting letter in it from the Jews, it is lengthy and you would be high  ly edefied to have a perusal of the whole of it but I can only give you some items   from it, They say the Lord has oppened the way where by they might get possession   of their beloved citty and they lost no time but exerted themselves to rebuild their beloved   citty and the undertakeing prospered in their hands so that they have completed  the Medrash and greate is the glory of the house and also of the houses of the teachers  of the law and they have authorized one Aaron Selig Ashkenazi to go forth with a   proclamation to all their brethren soliciting them to come and assist them they   seam greately rejoiced at their present prospects. There has been an Indian his wife  and daughter baptize in Commerce last April they were much pleased with the book  of mormon and said every word of it was true he was an interpreter for 6 tribes he   said that his brethren would receive the work every one of them they come 6 or 7   hundred miles to be acquainted with it. Brother Joseph has been dilivering a course   of lectures of late upon the eternal judgment the eternity of matter &c &c I often thought   how interesting they would have been to you as well as others he made it so plain   that a child could understand it — the work is progressing in every part of America  but not as fast as in Eng. I showed your letters to brother Joseph there was quite a   number present he to^ld^ them to give audience while the last one was red as I had   shown him the others before they all gave attention and was much pleased with  the contents none more so than Joseph he wants me to let him see your letters which  I have done he says he would not leave his family so but would take them with him  if he took them on his back — The church began to build a house on the other side of   the river ^for us^ but they do not think of finishing it this fall sister Young has moved into   her house on that side but it is not quite finished the body of ours is up to the roof and there  it stands sister Taylor's is not finished sister Pratt had one bought for her — brother   G.A. Smiths father lives in our house in Lovely street I did think of moveing there this   fall but expect now to stay where I am now untill you return as father Clark has   made me welcome he says tell br. Woodruff I that he will take as good care of me as he can   and he wants you to get as many souls as he can sends his respects likewise, — we   have had a wedding in the family her[e] of late that sister Church that I mentioned in   my March letter has lately been married to one of father Clark's sons John Wesly   the[y] send their respects to you likewise all the family. Sister's Young Taylor Kimbal   Pratt Clark Turley and Hadlock and families are well likewise br G A Smiths fathers   and family he wishes me to say for him that he has lately received a letter from   him and answered the same. my he My health is quite good at present and has been   since last june when the fever and ague left me little Willford Owen has got it now and   it is hard for him but I think he will get over it hope so at least he and I needs   a large share in your prayers that we may be supported by the grace of God. I have sold my   youngest calf the cow does do as well this season as last. I should be muchfor   pleased to have you get your likeness taken if you can. The next time you go to Eng. I want to go   with you I have not forgotten your promis of staying at home 3 years after we were   married and I presume you have not — yet when you come home we will talk about   those things. I have not yet received those papers you mentioned the Millennial   star but earnestly hope I shall as I feel anxious to see them. I feel verry sorry   you do not get the times and seasons, I want you to write often. as brother William   Clark wants to write some to you I must soon give way for him he will occupy   the next page he is father Clark's oldest son at home and a worthy man so I must   close by wishing you further prosperity and that the grace mercy and peace of   God may rest upon and preserve you from all evil accidents and harm and enable   you to fill your mission in meekness and the love and fear of God and return you   safely to the bosom of your family is the daily prayer of your true friend  W. Woodruff P.W. Woodruff    You sell tell me to kiss the children for you that I did verry often before little Sarah   died and she used to kiss me many time for pa,pa, as she called you and a little before   the breath left her body she kissed me for you and little Willo as she called him I wish   you could have seen her she was much mor interesting the last 2 weeks of her life than   before because she learned to talk much she possessed a lovely disposition you would   have been pleased with it. I often kiss little Willford Owen for his pa. and think   the poor child never had the privilege of seeing him but hope he will ere long - la it is   said he resembles his mother much, he grew finely before he was sick. If you could   get me a wrought muslin or lace cape I should be much pleased with it. If little   Sarah could have lived I should have thought ^my^ troubles and afflictions were   light but now I think they are serious. Please give my respects to all of the Amer  ican brethren and the Saints around you particularly to br. Kingston and family   where you make it your home. So farewell dear W.  you know I want to see you dont you    I do not know as you can read these mixed pages

 Ledbury, Herefordshire, England, April 24th, 1840.    My Dear Phebe    I again appropriate a little time to fill a sheet to you. which I shall  mostly take up in giving an account of the work of the Lord in this Country. I wrote you  a long letter while in Staffordshire at the potteries, but whether it has fallen into your hands or  not I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, &  I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been as  much disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have written  to you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first mark  of your pen but once since I last saw you, & then you & Sarah was both sick in bed  & you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters Turley &  Clark both wrote to their husbands & their letters arivd safe & I was in hopes to have herd a  word about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishing  to cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me since  I left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you s[t]ill  to continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you  & little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untill  the first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of Elder Turley numbering nearly  one hundred & I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare the  word had been preached at all & I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire[.] it is about 40  miles from Birmingham, 30 from Bristol, 100 from London & bordering upon Wales, I commenced  Working & the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr John Benbows a large  farmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land[.] his Brother William Benbow went from the potteries  with me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in Commerce or Montrose for he has gone to  America & will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5th of March I preached at  his house on the 5th & was convinced that their was many that would come into the church I also preached  on the 6th & Baptzed 6 persons 4 of which were preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist order, John Benbow & wife were baptized  I preached on the 8th & Baptzd [◊] 7. 4 were preachers  9th I Prechd & Baptzed 7, 2 were preachers  10th I Baptzd 12 three were preachers  13th I Baptzd 3.  16th I Baptzd 3  20th I Baptzd 3 one a preacher  21 I Bap 4, two preachers  23d I Bap 12 one a preacher  24th I Baptzed 9. four were preachers  27th I Baptzed 7 four were preachers  28 I Baptzd 2 one a Methodist preacher  29 I Baptzd 13. several were preachers  30 I Baptzd 9, five were preachers  31st I Baptzd 13, four were preachers  April 2d I Baptized 9, two were preachers  4th I Baptzd 11 women  5 I Baptzed 9 three were preachers  6th I Baptzed 5. one preacher  & one Clark of the Church of England  8th I Bap 7 four were preachers  9th I Baptzed 5 in the midst of a shower of stones  tha fell upon me from a mob  10th I Baptzed several persons    After labouring here one Month I receivid a letter from Elder  Taylor in Liverpool stating that the Twelve had just arivd from  New York & I must come immediately & meet with them in  conference at Preston & so I left this part of the vineyard & travled 160   miles to Preston & attended a conference with the 12 & the church in general   & had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren from  America & immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder   Brigham Young & Elder W. Richards will soon join us in this vast field that   is now open before us I never have seen such a vast field for labour  as the Lord has enabled me to open where I now am since the church was  first established either in America or England. I preached here one month  & 5 days & baptized the superintendant of the Church of the United Brethren & about  45 Preachers of the same order with about 120 of the members making about  160 in all, & this senery has flung into my hands or under my care &  superintendancy more than forty esstablished places of preaching which are  licensed according to Law including one or two chapels & their is now about  200 ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity offers I have Baptized some    here of most classes rich as well as poor. a Number of large farmers  I have Baptized from 8 to 13 the first time I have preachd in several places  The Lord of Hosts has been with me & much of the convinceing spirit  of God has accompaned the word. The whole country was immediately  stired up[.] the Ministers was of England of the Church of England I was inf  ormed held a council upon the subject to stop me in my preaching & also  the work one of the Church Ministers called upon the constable of the parish to  take me up but he called upon the wrong man for he had recievd my testimony & I had baptzed  him. but as they cannot stop me by either the Law of the Land or the word of God, I have been [in◊◊◊d][.]  they offer to Baptize those of their own church if they desire it this is done thinking to save them from  joining us for I have baptized a number of their ^members^ churches. I have had vast congregation out to my  meeting both priest & people. their will spedily be a mighty work in this country I think there 
 will be several hundred Baptzed soon in this part of the vineyard there is now nearly 200 sants  here & the work if but just begun to human appearance Elders Young, & Richards, & myself will  continued in this part of the vineyard untill we have secured the grain which is ripe for  the harvest the work is rooling [rolling] on in every part of England where the word is faithfully proclamd  we have sent the Minutes of our Conferene to the Editors of the Times & Seasons & you  will see by that, that we are about to publish a Hymn Book & also a Monthly periodical  Elder P P Pratt is the Editor of the some [same] which will be published in Manchester which will  be his place of abode for the present, O Pratt is well & going North & will visit Edinburg  the capital of Scotland. Elders Mulliner & Wright have Baptized about 40 in Scotland.  John Tayler about 30 in Liverpool where he will Labour for the present Heber C. Kimble  is well & will visit the churches which he has formerly built up & then thinks some of going to  Ireland Elders Youg Richards & Woodruff are well & will labour for a season in Herefordshire,  Glostershire, Worcestershire, & then think of visiting London & Bristol, Eldr Hadlock is well & going to  the North of England Eldr Clark is well not well but he has had a few shakes of the fever & ague but is  getting better. Eldr Fielding is well & will watch over the churches with Brothr Clark, Elder Turly is  well as to health but last I herd from him he was preaching to the spirits in prison for he has been  confined in Stafford Gaol for more than a Month he was taken up by a man in Birmingham  under pretene of Debt but it was to stop him from preaching, as soon as I herd of it I  went to see him & carried him some provisions & money so that he should not suffer. he has  friends now that are administering unto him so he has what he needs I expect he will soon  be liberated he is preaching to the prisoners & some want to be Baptzed I saw two men hung  at the gaol the day I went to visit him. Elder Tayler is well & has just recievd a letter from  Sister Tayler which said that you was well & I was exceding glad to hear it I do not know  when the Letter was dated but I Believe in Janowary Jan I have not had a letter from any friends  in America since I arived in England. I have written to Fathr & Mothr Carter. Sarah Foss &  Ilus at N.Y. When you write inform me about them. Mr William Benbow Left Liverpool  a few day since for commerce I did not know that he was going so soon I had no chance  to see him before he went if he I had I should have sent some letters by him to you & some  other small articles their is much of the spirit of gathering with the Saints in this Land John  Benbow has sold his property to the amount of about £1,500 & wants to go as soon as the Lord will[.]  I have had some scenes here some like ancient times soon after I commencd preeching  in Ledbury or Herefordshire the Sound spedily went abroad & thee Ministers or preahers came more  then 20 miles in a gig to see me & inquire into thes things they never had herd me preach or  any of our people & when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothing  to go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had baptized recevd my testimony I invited them into the  room whare I was & I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had come  to learn who I was & who had sent me & what message I had for them & the people. I then  stood up & taught them Jesus Christ & the first principles of the gospel & testified of the Book  of Mormon & the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish & while I was  yet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us & bore testimony unto them of the truth of  my words & they bowed down & prayed & gave glory to God for his marvelous work & they  rose up & the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into the  pool & I Baptzed them & lade my hands upon them & they recevd the Holy Ghost & went  their way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time  & as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wanting  to hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me & he went into the pulpit with  me & opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah & praying mightyly for the Lord to bless  me & make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose & preached to 
 the largest congregation (it was said) that ever met in the Chapel & they did not have over  an hours notice many appeared Believing, the Baptists Minister gave me his hand & bid me God  speed, aftr meeting I Baptized 13, ^next morning^ & the Lord is opening many doors upon the right & left. You  will see from the Times & Season the No of the Saints in England which were represented at  our conferene sumwhare about 1800 in all nearly one half of which have been  Baptized since Hide & Kimble left England. We have another conference in Preston on  the 6th of At July at which time I expect a large addition of Numbers, I have visit  many parts of England since I arivd & in my travels I have visited many of the Ancient  & Noted castles, & Cathedrals which are well worth the attention of a Historian or travler  the most Noted one I have visited is the splended Ancient Cathedral standing in the City of  Worcester Elder Young was with me this Cathedral surpasses any thing for splendor &  architecture mine eyes ever beheld it is about 500 feet in length parts of it about 150 in  highth it was 8 or 900 years of age[.] it contained many Monuments & portraits of persons  graven out of solid marble & lade over the tombs & vaults of Ancient Bishops, Lords, & Princes  some of which have lane there for 7 or 800 years it is said that some of those monument with  their winding sheets al of which are car[ve]d out of solid marble is as neatly executed as any  thing found in Europe Almost every thing about it is carved out of solid fine marble. the whole  pulpit with all its trimings & hangings & deorations is carved out of one solid stone. There is a large  organ in the building & the church of England still worship there & hold a meeting twice every day  in a year We stayed though one service. We also have been on to the top of Malvern Hill which is  the most Noted Hill in England in consequene of it being the highest Hill in England & the most  splended prospect of all the surround country for 30 miles & on some of the Highest peaks are  large intrenchments whare men retreated to in the time of the Roman war The building  in the village of Malvern are splended standing on the side of thes Hills it has long been a  place of retreat for the Kings Queens Princes Lords & Nobleman of London & other parts of  England.

My Dear Companion, in all our sacraifices, afflictions sickness, sorrow, &  persecutions let us strive to be patient & resigned to the will of God in all these  things I am well aware that these things are not joyous but grievous for a moment  but afterwards it will yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto those that  are exercised thereby. Let us not think strange that our afflictions are multiplyd  upon us for it is through tribulations that we inherit the Kingdom & we have but little  time to pass through these trials & tribulations before the scene will be closed & joy  will come & we shall enter that rest that remains for the Saints [page torn] the Lord will  make a short work in the Earth this last time. & our sorrows will not be lengthened  as many of the Ancients were for the want of time which may account for our having  so many of them in quick succession. I have had much joy & consolation vibrate  my bosom in my lonely meditations while walking over the parks, fields &, hills of England  even at the thought that I have a companion that thus far has not hesitated to make  the sacrifices which God has required of her, & inasmuch as you have done it thus far  do not be discouraged in future trials for your reward is great & your joy shall  be full & no power shall take it from you. I expect to reign with you in the  malinneum [millennium] & als[o] in a Celestial Glory with the Children which God may give us  which will more then pay us for the toils we have in this Life. That the Blessings of God may rest  upon you & give you the desire of your heart & bestow upon you food rament, grace & friends  is the prayer of your companion who is in the vineyard of the Lord Willford

 Burslem Staffordshire Potteries England July 17th 1840    My Dear Companion    As I have occupied one of two pages as you will find in other   letters in conversing about temporal matters & things of miner consequene I feel  disposed to fill this page in expressing my feelings unto you upon the great plan  of Salvation, sumthing of my present expectations & an account of the work in this  Land. When I take into consideration the day & generation in which we live even in this   last dispensation & fullness of times, the awful calamity that awaits the gentile  Nations of the present age, The Allmighty work of God that is to be accomplised before   the Comeing of Christ, the esstablishing of Jerrusalem in her power, & Zion in her   glory, the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last tine, & form some small   view of those greater misteries & glories of the Celestial Kingdom which are not lawful to   be w[ri]tten & are yet to be revealed, & having a dispensation of the gospel committed unto   me in common with my Brethe which is ^to^ accomplish the great work of God which  he has set has hand, ^to do^ I say when I comprehend these things I do not summon words  that God has call us to make such great sacrafices in these last days, I now see the  greater the sacrafice the greater the crown [FIGURE] The ancient Saints of God have been called   to make great sacrifices that they might comprehend a Selestial Glory, then if   we enjoy the same glory we are called to make a sacrafise also, & have we   not done it, yes verily we have equal to any people that ever lived according to the tine  we have been a people, or church of Christ I cannot make a greater sacrafise  than the society of my wife & family ^children^ but notwithstanding this sacrifice is of of the   keenest kind to my wife as well as myself yet does my Bosom friend in her heart  ever for a moment wish me to scease doing the will of God, or in the least to tarnish  our future & eternal glory, or to dim our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord-  Jesus No I will not for a moment believe it. Then my Dear friend & companion still   continue patient untill my return which will be as soon as is the will of God  though we are seperated a few days here yet we shall reign & live together 1000 years  with the children which God shall give us & also with our Lord Jesus Christ &   we shall also enjoy each other society in a Celestial Kingdom to part no more  We now laying the foundation here of a great work even directly or indirectly  among all the gentile Nations. M ^our^ present intention is to spend the winter in Europe  & return to Commerce in the Spring it is a great voyage & journey from   Montrose to England & as we are hear it appears to be wisdom & the will of God 
 that we should spend a few months more before we return, The work of the  Lord is rolling on swiftly in this land & the present signs are that the gentiles will  spedily be warned. Already are there thousands rejoiceing in the New & Everlasting Covenant   in England, the standard of truth as an ensign to the people is reared up in the largest  cities of Scotland, & Saints rejoicing therein The warning voice is spedily to be heard  in the City of Belfast Ireland,  The cry is heard in Wales come & preach unto us   Already ^has^ ^has^ the fulness of the gospel started upon the wings of the wind & the Bellows of   the deep by the hand of an Elder of Israel to the east Indies, This vary day a gallant Ship   spreads her sail at London into which Elder William J. Barret enters as his Ark to convey  him in safty to South Australia to proclaim the everlasting gospel to that far distat people  Notwithstanding he is but 17th years of age he is clothed with the power of the Priesthood  the revelations of Jesus Christ, of the spirit of his mission. Notwithstanding he has this   day left his native country & started on his voyage of 16000 [10000] miles yet he is filled   with rejoicing & his soul is made glad, which is fully manifest in a letter which   has just reached us from his hand exhorting us to be faithful & pray for him   declairing in the name of God that he will return to Zion bringing his   sheaves with him, he has taken our addresses in England & president  Joseph Smithjr in the U.S.A. & sayes he will write to him after he esstablises  his mission. he was raised up in the church at Stafford Shire Potteries. Thus   you see the gospel is winging its way with the rapidity of lightning throu  ghout the wor[l]d. Thus you see by the help of God we are laying the foundation   of a mighty work throughout the European wor[l]d & other Islands of   the Sea. We expect to spedily lift up the Standard in the City of London  & visit France ^France^ & Jermany during the winter if the Lord will, The Millennial Star  begins to dawn & we hope soon to behold the rising Sun Now in the time  for us to prove ourselves, & work while the day Last lest night come when no  man can work. & while the work is rolling on swiftly in foreign Nations I  rejoice to hear of the progress of it in my own County esspecially this the seed  of Israel in the western wiles have begun to receive the fulness of the gospel. I pray   my heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ to hasten the day when Ephraims Nobles  will be of himself & his Gover[n]our procede out of the midst of him & Judah rejoice  & Israel be made glad, & Judah Jerrusalem be rebuilt upon her own heaps,   & Zion become the joy of the whole Earth. Roll on O ye little stone cut out   of the mountain without hands. untill ye become a mountain & fill the whole the   whole Earth 
 O Lord let the fulness of thine everlasting gospel spedily go to all the gentile  Nations when they count themselves unworthy of Eternal life may the law be   learned & testimony sealed in their midst that they be left without excuse  May Israel spedily return & seak the Lord his God & thy goodness in the Latter day  let the prayer of the widow & the cry of the orphan assend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth  let the Heavens witness their tears & record them on high untill the Allmighty shall  come out of his hiding place & avenge those Widows & Orphans of the Spilt Blood   of their Martered husbands & fathers which was shed by the Iron hand of the Inhabitants   of Missouri for the word of God & the testimony of Jesus Christ. Let the Americ  an Nation spedily learn that there is a God in Israel who holds the destinies   of all Nations & at whose command goes forth the Issues of life & Death. O   Lord cloth thy Saints with Salvation & thine elders with the power of God  Let thy special witnesses be swift to the Nations of the Earth. Let council   wisdom & the fear of God rest upon them untill all thy purposes are accomplised  concerning them which thou dost Deign to perform Give thy prophets wisdom means  & power to esstablish Zion & her Stakes to be throne down no more forever   but to remain as an asylum & a place of refuge for the honest in [page torn]  thee meek of the earth from the gathering storm which is about to fall [page torn]  the heads of this generation. Which is the prayer of your companion  Phebe W. Woodruff                                                                      W Woodruff    NB I shall expect all of my letters here after to be forwaded to 149 Oldham Road Manchester  write often as you can & give me all the news. give my respets to Sister Lydia M Luce  & all the fox Island friends to Broth Haw Clarks family & all the Saints who inquire  to the presidency, & Bishops, & Elders, priests, Teachers, Deacons, & Saints, was glad   to hear our friends were well in Maine & Farmington you are now passing  through the sickly season wish I knew how you are getting along these days. Well my   Dear Phebe let us be as patient as we can our sufferings will soon be ore  & we will have a long time of rest. it is a great consolation to my feelings to see  you so willing to endure these things you shall not loose your reward & you   will one day rejoice that you have past though these things. two lettes which you wrote  to me I have not yet obtained I am now looking for Elder Hide evry day. I   made some extracts from your last letter for the Star by request of  Elder Young Write as soon as you get this I think it would be well for you   to have a house built in Commerce if you can get one. I shall try to   bring home some means with me for you when I come if possible. I think  of calling upon our friends in Maine on my return continue to pray for me   I will constatly remember you before a throne of grace.

My last letter which I wrote you was Dated   June 8d in which I informed you that I recievd your letter under Date   of March which was of much interest to me which is the ownly letter that I have   as yet receievd from you since I have been in England. But I am   now expecting letters from you every Day & I trust I shall not be   disappointed in obtaining one from you soon. I am in hopes we shall   not be under the necessity of waiting so long for letters from each other   as we have done here to fore, for when we are begin to obtain letters in exchange   I hope to obtain letters from you as Often as one in a Month for I shall   endeavor to write as often as that & hope you will do the same. I have   and shall have much that I would like to communicate to you from   time to time.    I am enjoying the best of health & spirits, & am happy;   & I never enjoyed myself better while in the vineyard of the Lord. & could   I Behold the faces of my wife & children often, it would greatly add to   my joy & consolation: But Knowing that we shall have our reward for   all the sacrafices that we are called to make in this life, for Christ sake, &   for all that we do in his cause & y Vineyard, causes me to be reconciled   to his will. I wrote a letter to Prsdt Joseph Smith, Jr. in company with   Elder G.A. Smith, & T. Turley, June, 27th, In which I gave him a Brief accou  nt of my labours in the vineyard.    We have held two conferences of late, in the   South of England where I have been labouring; the first was held at the Gadfield Elm Chapel, in ^wor^ wostershire ^wosce^ ^worcestershire,^ England, June 14th. Elder W. Richards was with me, we had an inter  esting time, we organized 12 churches, & transacted much business; the other   was held on the 21st of June, at Stanly Hill, Herefordshire, England. Elder Richards & myself   conducted the meeting, or conferene with the help of God. & I never saw more   business executed in one day, than on that occasion. We organized 20 churches, Ordained 4 Elders, 7 Priest, & 4 Teachers; Baptized 10, Confirmed 20, & Blessed 20 children,   besides a multitude of other business, & broke bread to several hundred Saints, &c.   The work had been so rapid, it was impossible to ascertain the exact No. belonging   to each branch, but the whole Number is 33 churches, 534 members, 75 officers, viz;   10 Elders, 52 Priest, 13 Teachers, all of which had imbraced the work in less time than 
 four months in a new field which I have opend in Herefordshire, Westershire,   & Glostershire & the church now in that place numbers over 600, & the work   never in a more prosperous state in that place than at the present time:   I had no doubt but what the churches in that place will soon No. 1000 souls.   We have set all the churches in that region in Order, ◊ ^with^ Officers members presiding   over them, & they are now Baptizing daily in that region, about 50 of those   Baptized, were preachers of different Orders. Between 3 & 400 hundred of which, I   have Baptized: & so you see the sacrafice which we are called to make, is not   in vain. I feel vary thankful to God for the manner he has blessed me in   my labours sine I have been in England. I also attended a conference   the Staffordshire potteries on my way to Manchester, & had an interesting time.   I arivd in Manchester On the 1st day of July, & I spe^n^t 3 days with the Twelve,   & other friends in writing, transacting business, visiting the Saints, preparing for the confer  ene, &c. & had a pleasant time. On Sunday the 5th of July, I met with the   Saints, & a large congregation of Citizens in the Joiners Hall in Manchester, for public   worship: this hall, the Saints have hired for their regular place of meeting, they   pay £100. (about $500) yearly; it will seat about 2000 souls; the rent is paid by   contribution. There was about 1000 persons present, I preached in the forenoon &   several testified in the Afternoon, while we were communig with about 400   Saints: the power of God was upon the people. Monday, July 6th the quorum   of the Twelve & a general conferene of the Church of L.D.S. sat in conferene   in Europe, met at the above namd place, & we had an interesting day; there   were Elders present from every almost evry church in England, & Scotland; there was abot ^about^   40 churches represented, containing 2,495 members, 59 Eldes, 122 Priests, 61 Teachers, 13 Deacons,   making an increase of about 824 members, 25 Elders, 70 priest, 23 Teachers, & 5 Deacons, during  the last three months; & 374 members, 9 Elders, 50 Priests, & 13 Teachers of the above number, were   added in the Herefordshire churches in which ^where^ I had been labouring. But the foundation is   now la^i^de in such a manner in this country, & new Doors opening in England, Scotland,   Ireland, & Wales, so that we have evry reason to expect a greater increas for the months   to come, than has been in the thee that are past.    I pray God to roll on this work in   mighty power in this country & in all Nations & enable us to be humble in the   midst of prosperity, & work righteousness with all diligence while the day last, & learn  learn that it is the mercy, & work of God that giveth us Souls as seals of our   ministry. July 8th the Elders are mostly leaving Manchestr to day for their missions abroad. 
 The Twelve are all well, also Elder Hadlock, ^&^ Turley; & Clark excep Brothr Clark has  had a little of the ague.) Elder Kimble ^Kimball^ sayes give my love to Phebe. Elder Willard Richards makes  the same request & so do all the Twelve that are here. (Elder O. pratt was not at our conf  erene, but preaching in the City of Edinburg, Scotland, & has Baptized 5. Elder Hadlock has  esstablished a preaching place in Glasgow, & baptized seven. Elder Tayler has Baptized about 70 in  Liverpool, but it thinking of visiting Ireland for a little season. soon. Elder Young is  expecting to visit remain in Manchester for a season, to assist in printing the Book of Mormon.

 Ledbury. Herefordshire. England. June 3d ^1840^    My Dear Phebe,  I take this method to inform you that on last Saturday  night the 30th of May, just as I had retired to rest in company with Elder Richards  at Br John Benbows. A Brother came into the room & informed us he had 6 letters  for us. On opening them We found 2 from Preston, Sister Richards & an Elder. one  from a Sister in West Bromwick. one from Elder B. Young & P.P. Pratt Manchester. one  from Milton Holmes Georgetown. & one from Phebe W. Woodruff Montrose  Dated March 8th & 22d & most of these letters was full of glad tidings so much  so that it drove sleep from our eyes for the night. & we both felt more like going  into the street & shouting Hallalujah than we did like being wraped in Sleep. You may  rest assured it created no small degree of joy in my mind to receave a letter from  your hand for it is the first word I have recieved from you & the ownly one since  I saw you excepting one letter which I receved from you while in New York. I have not  receved your letter spoken of the first of Jan. I feel thankful that you have receved my  letters which I wrote you while in America, this is the fourth letter I have  sent you since I have been in England which I hope you will get. I have also sent  two letters to the Editors of the Times & Seasons. I have long been anxious to hear from  you & know how you was getting along temperally & Spiritually. I feel to rejoice in the  Blessing which God has given us, & that you have been so comfortable in your sickness  & that God has opened a door whereby you have found some friends in a time of need. I  also feel to rejoice to hear from little Sareah Emma & Willford. I pray the Lord to preserve them  Blameless unto the comeing of the Lord Jesus Christ & use them for his own glory. &  give them a place with their parents in Zion while Christ reigns. I have much upon my  mind I wish to say to you much more than I can put upon this Sheat. But for  the want of room I can ownly briefly hint at them. I sent you a letter a mamouth sheet  filled full of Jan 30th & one April 24th I also wrote some in a letter that B. Young sent to his wife  April 23d, On the 30th of April I received a letter from Mother Woodruff Farmington. Dated in Marh  All was well there, I sent a Letter ^to^ M. Holmes to come to England. I have just got an answer  all well in that region, but hard times. I have lately sent a full letter to Sister S. Foss. I wish  you to write to me often & give me all the news, it is a great consolation to hear from  my little family while I am seperated from them. You say you are at father Clarks &  ask if it would not be best to stay there untill I come home, you say they make you free &  welcome this being the case I would advise you to stay untill my return if you can feel at    Please kiss little Sarah E. & Willford for me I should be pleased to see you all much. I had as leave his name  would be Willford as any thing, I like single names best, for boys) May the Lord bless him. I want him to grow  as fast as he can & take turns with me in the vineyard by & by, so that I can be with you part of the time  take good care of him & that I know you will do. you shall all have my prayers & Blessing & the Lord will bless you 
 home it will be so much less care & trouble than it will be to see to your own  wood water &c. this is simply my present feeling upon the subject, Remember me with gratitude  to Brother Clark. & tell him for me that if he feels willing to lend you the hand of assistance in  this your time of need & let you tarry with him untill my return, that he shall not  loose his reward & he shall have my prayers & Blessing & the Blessing of God shall rest upon  him & his children, & his childrens children untill the latest generation, could I  have the privilege of being with my own family I would not trouble any person with  them, But a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me in common with my  Brethren & required at our hands in consequence of which my family must be assisted by  some one in time of need. & I say again in the name of Jesus Christ that that soul  who does good to my wife or children while I am in the vineyard of the Lord doing his work  shall be blessed of the Lord & no power shall take it from them, & I feel vary thankful  to Brother Clark for his kind offer. Give my respects to the Sister Clark you speak of & also Brother  Clarks Son, Remember me to Bror & Sister Smoot, & Brother L. Whight & family should you see them  & all enquiring friends I rejoice to hear of the progress of the work in America & the prospect of  the Saints being rewarded for their loss by the government. I was much pleased with your  letter it contained much news. I gave you an account in my last letter of my  opening a new field in the South part of England, in Herefordshire, the work of the Lord  has continued to roll on from the time I first commenced preaching in this part of the  land untill the present time in a manner that I have never before seen it in these last  days, it is not yet 3 months since I first lifted up my voice to preach to the people in  this part of England a region which had not herd the sound of it before but now conta  ins a Church of 500 Saints, with about 50 Elders & priests. about 50 of which   were preachers of the orders of the day, I have administered Baptism to about 300 of  the Saints above spoken of, & Elders Young & Richards & the Elders & priests which  we have raised up in this Branch have Baptized the other 200, & the field which is opened  here is so large & extensive that it seems as though the work had but just began  here & I expect hundreds will be added to the Church here. It is rapidly opening  doors in all the Surrounding country in the South of England & also in Wales we have  Baptized some few in the Border of wales. We have this day receeved the first No of the  Latter Day Saints Millennial Star. published by the travling council Edited by P P Pratt at  Manchester England. We shall soon have a collection of Hymns of at ^out^ of Press, & the  Book of Mormon will soon be in tipe. The work is progressing rapidly in every part of  England & Scotland where it is faithfully proclaimed. Elders Mullener & Wright are doing  well in Scotland. O. Pratt has gone to Scotland I have not herd from him. Jn  Taylor is Baptizing in Liverpool. The American Brethen are well as far as I know  Elder Turley is out of Prision, is well & preaching. We have a general conference to  be held in Manchester on the 6th day of July next for the Elders of England, Scotland, & Wales  I shall then expect to meet with all the quorum of the Twelve that are hear I  have not yet herd from O Hide. B.Young came down & spent 2 or 3 weeks with  me & has gone back to Manchester to assist P P Pratt in printing. Elder Richard has  left me this morning to visit the Border of Wales We Baptized a man confirmed & ordained  him a priest. & he commenced Baptizing all in one day & next morning he started to carry  the gospel to the Border of Wales & commenced Baptizing & Elder Richards has gone to assist  him a few days. I have left orders for the Millennial Star to be sent to you 
 I trust you will get them. The Lord is about to do a great work in this  Land it is beginning to progress like fire in a day Stubble We have wrote to the president  of the Seventies to send us 20 of the quorum & also wrote for some High priest.  Notwithstanding we have Baptized about 500 whare I am now labouring, yet it does not  we are daily Baptizing as many now as at any time. We having a spare day a short time  since met at Elder Kingtons & had a feast with about 100 Saints Elders Young,  Richards & myself were present we had an interesting time much good instruction was  given 19 Baptized & confirmed, & Ordained 1. Elder & 6. Priest. Last Sunday I attended a  camp meeting & preached upon the Book of Mormon & after Meeting Baptized 14  & 9 next morning We are Baptizing daily & some of the time 4 & 5 times a day  these are busy days with me. Preaching, Baptizing, confirming, Ordaining, Counciling,  writing, trouhing, keeping journals, & all together gives me but little time to  rest But I never enjoyed Better health or Spirits than at the present time. I am  now at Elder Thomas Kingtons whare we make it our home he was the superintendent  of 45 preachers & the Same number of licensed preaching places. I Baptized him with  the other preachers which have opened those doors for us to preach in I Baptized Brother Kington  21st March Ordained him an Elder 22d of March which was a Memoirible event for  (Willford Woodruff Jr) Elder Kingtons whole family is in the church their has been  ^a notable^ miricle wrought upon one of the family Sister Mary Pitt was confirmed b[page torn]  ^in bed 6 years^ years [page torn] & has not walked for 11 years ownly upon crutches Elders Young Richards  & myself lade hands upon her & she was healed & now walks upright with  out a crutch or staff. Signs are following the believer in this land. My Dear  Phebe it does my Soul much good to see your resignation to the will of God  in the midst of our seperation. The Lord is blessing me labours much in this land, be  patient untill we meet again, you shall not loose your reward, for your reward  shall be to stand with me in Zion with the children which God shall give us. & enjoy  each others society with our children for one thousand years while Christ reigns  & then to inherit the earth together to part no more. & enjoy far greater glories  & Blessings than the present state of things can afford. I think this will a[paper torn] repay us  for any sacrifice we can make for a few years. Pray for me that I may be humble in  the midst of prosperity as well as adversity. I feel a great desire to do the will of God in  all things. My prayer to God is that health & strength, grace & resignation to the will of God  may continue with you & the children which God has given us unto the end. & Also that  God will Bless Joseph & his councillors with means, wisdom, & power to do the work of God in  Zion & her stakes. & that all the Saints may be Sanctified by a Celestial Law is the prayer of  Willford Woodruff    Remember me to Brother Meacham I know how to sympathize with him with a broken leg. You ask me if I  can tell you when I shall come home No Phebe I cannot tell you now but I shall return to the  bosom of my family as soon as the Lord will. I expect quite a number of the saints will go to America  from England this fall. We probably shall know more what the will of God is concerning us in few months  hence. we have made some enquiry of Joseph (by letter) concerning us we expect to hear from him before  long. the Lord is getting some strong holds in this country we are laying the foundation for a mig  hty work here, two or three of us think of visiting London immediately after the conference if the Lord will  & setting up the work there. write as soon as you get this & give me all the knews & tell me how  you & the children get along direct to Ledbury, Herefordshire, England. I ever remain your Willford

 52 Ironmonger Row, St Lukes, London. Octr. 30th 1840.    My Dear Phebe,  I received your kind & affectionate letter ^written^ in the midst of  affliction & mourning under Date of July 18th 1840. truly your  letter brought tidings which were painful & sorrowful to me, but  notwithstanding this it was not without its joys, For while I keenly   felt the [roots], & to mourn the Loss of the lovely flower which God had lent  unto us a few days & then taken it away in an hour that was best calcu  lated to try the feelings of a kind & affectionate Mother & an absent Father  & while I felt to sympathise with my Dear Companion who alone had been   called to watch her tender ospring in my absence & behold her life depart & follow  her remains to the grave without a single relative to mingle a tear, you in the   midst of this affliction meditation & sorrow I truly rejoice before the Lord, I rejoice  that God hath taught us the principles of life & Death, time & Eternity, the Resurrection   & the judgment. I rejoice that we are not Called to mourn without hope, but  that we have the fulest assurance that we shall meet our Child in the first resurrection  As we have got to come up through great tribulations in order to inherit  the Celestial kingdom of God, I rejoice that in all these trials, sacrifises losses  & crosses, we have one the less to go through. I again rejoice that God hath  given you grace, strength & fortitude, to support you in the midst of   this deep affliction, & it hath been the highth of my joy, sweetened all my lonely  lonely meditations, & filled the days of my consolation to know that God hath  granted me a companion in this life who hath been willing to make evry sacrafice   which God hath lade upon her for my sake for the sake of Christ & for the sake of   a celestial kingdom whare we shall reign forever, whare the wicked & ungodly  will scease from troubling & the weary be at rest, yes my Dear Companion  in affliction, you may rest assured, the whole spirit of your letter the resignation  you manifest gives me great joy. I know your sorrow, trials & afflictions are  keen, & sacrifices great. Why is it there with you, with me & with the Saints at large  in evry age of the World. Ah the first resurrection will tell, the judgment of   the great day will declare, & the Celestial glory of God will more fully illustrate  the truth of all these things unto you then I can possibly do with my pen  the Lord Jesus suffered & desended below all things, the Holy prophets & Apostles   in evry age of the world have suffered greatly & come up through tribulations  in there day & now we have ours, & we shall find at last that all our sufferings   trials, & privations are ownly to prove us & more fully prepare us to rightly  prise that rest, comprehend the glory, & enjoy the fulness of that reward which we shall receive  at the end of the race, Then under this view of things shall we not kiss the rod & be  resigned, I can exclaim yes with every feelings of my Soul, I can say with my  Dear Wife the Lord hath given & the Lord hath given & the Lord hath taken  away & blessed be the name of the Lord. I I can but bear evry trial that I am  called to pass through in this life as well as I have the Death of Sarah Emma I shall bee  thankful, she was a beautiful flower, I loved it with all all my heart but as willingly  resigned it to God. I shall never forget the last look she gave me when I took the parting   hand with her. The first intimation I had of her death was on the 22d of Oct several   letters was sent me from Manchester one of which was from Elder W. Richards &  while reading over the list of the Deaths among the Saints Sarah Emma Woodruff  caught my eye, it produced a peculiar sensation in my mind which went through   me like electricity yet my nerve was firm I continued reading as though nothing   had happened & from that moment to the present I have felt perfectly resigned 
 so by receiving this intelligence I was prepared for the reception of your letter  I also feel thankful that you have some friends that try to comfort you in   your afflicitons & necessities, I feel that Sister Margarett has prooved herself a  friend in deed as far as it hath been in her power & she shall not loose her   reward & I feel thankful to all the friends for there kindness unto you in   your afflictions, & Mourning. I copied Sister Margaretts lines in my journal   they were sentimental & good. I thank Brother Petty for writing to me I was truly glad to   hear from him. I feel to send my blessings to him & his houshold, Phebe I have   had several interviews with you in my sleep & ^on^ one occasion Sarah Emma was not   with us & I enquired where she was you said she was Dead & gave me sumthing   of an account of it, but as I had heard from you since & she was well, it had almost   worn of my mind, I found from my conversation with you you had many  lonely hours, & some gloomy meditations, as you were left alone so long & had no  Relatives to keep you company, I know this is trying & none would have bourn it   better than you have done possessing that warm attachment to friends & Relatives   which virtue hath been so perminant in your whole life, Was it in my power   I would willingly bear your sorrows myself, but as I cannot I am comforted   with the reflection, that these sorrowful hours are not lade upon you because of   crime on your part or mine but that we are seperated for the Sake of the   Gospel & the cause of Christ, If any of our friends are in any more comfortable   circumstances as to the things of this present evil world in the midst of ease &   without sacrafice, how will it be a few years hence at the coming of Christ in   the resurrection the general judgment & in the Eternal World. my object is to be   on the safe side there, My object is to secure a safe abode in the Eternal world  even a Celestial Kingdom, yes if I can but once see this second to   myself my wife & childen it will amply reward me for all my toils & labours  my sacrafises & my hours of sorrow in this life, yes I can say wellcome   all these things If I can but at last obtain the favor of my God & a place   whare he dwelleth with my Wife & the children which God hath given us.  My constant prayer to god is that he will feed & cloth you, comfort your   heart, raise you up friends in my absens, & let his angels guard you & give  you grace according to your day in all things & spare your life & the remain  ning child for my sake. I am sorry you have not obtained more of my   Letters I have written you more than a dozen since I have been in England  & I have received a number from you which has done me much good, I also  sent a large number of letters to you by Elder Turley & the company which   went with him. (I also ^sent^ you by Elder Turley £7 seven sovreigns with many other things for you &  Sarah Emma & Willford, which I trust you have got before time I have others presents for you which I shall bring when  I come, which will be early in the spring if the Lord will) I sent two letters by Elder Mulliner to you   who sailed from Liverpool on the 15th of Oct for Nauvoo via Neworleans I also sent a very  long letter for the Times & Seasons by Elder Mulliner it contained an account of   my travels from the 8th of Aug. 1829 to the 7th of Oct 1840 it covered six side of a mamoth   sheet as full as I could print it. I mailed another one yesterday for the same purpose    Sleep my child, sleep a while, thy mission thou  hast closed, the debt of nature thou hast  paid and all is well with thee, I well remem  ber an hour, when the earth in a sable shade of   night was wrap'd & lighted ownly by the moon  thy Parents stood upon a ragged rock, the   Billows of the mighty deep surged from its   native element & dashed at their feet spent   its strength & sunk back in silence. Then   they spoke of thee, In like manner the hopes   of thy fond parents thou hast dashed, & returned  in silence to thy native earth but not to be forgo  tten, why all this, Ah Lovely Sarah thy share  of the bitter cup thou hast drank & hid thyself  for a while from the evils of this present   world though thy pilgraimage to earth was   short, busy thou hast been in partaking of   the sacrifices of thy generation, thou  hast shared in the deepest sorrow with thy   Parents in a journey or two thousand miles  in thy infancy but this is not all thou hast   made a sacrifice of the society of thy   father many long months who will meet  thee no more untill clothed in Immortality  In honour to thee my child thy Father drops   a tear by the midnight lamp in London while   naught but the watchmans voice is herd.  Then rest my child yes Sarah rest untill with thy   parents thou shalt rise clothed with Immortal   DAY    Extract of W Woodruff Journal Oct 18th After bearing testiment   to the Saints in London, & feeling a witness that there would   be a good work in this city. We retired to rest in good season  I felt well in my mind & slept untill 12 oclock at night  I awoke & meditated upon the things of God untill near   3 oclock & while forming a determination to warn the people   of London & overcome the powers of darkness by the assi  stance of God, A personage appeared unto me which I   considerd to be the prince of Darkness or the Devil. he made   war with me & attempted to take my life he caught me by   the throat & choaked me nearly to death he wounded me in   my forehead I also wounded him in a number of places   in the head As he was about to overcome me I prayed   to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ for help, I then   began to have power over him, the Lord sent his Angels   unto me who deliverd me by wounding my enemy & driving  him from me one personage dressed in white who I thought   was a friend i had seen before came to me prayed with me   & healed me. & I was instantly made whole & deliverd As soon   as I could speak I awoke Br Smith who was also in trouble 
 i.e for the press I copied it off with my pen & it filled four sheets of common  letter paper. I extracted it mostly from my journals & signed it Kinball, Woodruff  & Smith We also sent a lengthy letter to Bishop Elias Smith, we are sparing no   pains to communicate any intelligence to our friends in America that we   may have in our possession, I have just recieved two letters from our Maine   friends one from Sister Foss & the other from Brother Ilus F Carter they were   all well when they wrote & some of them were thinking of visiting Nauvoo next   season esspecially Brother Luther Scamman Brother Ilus sayes he has written   much to Phebe but had no answer he says letters will not reach him unless  they are directed to his store or address I have not herd from Father Woodruff  for many weeks I shall write to our Maine friends as soon as I finish   this. I shall expect a letter from you as soon as Eldr Turley arives &  you obtain the things which I have sent by him, The work of the Lord is   prosperous throughout Europe & all the America Brother are well.

 G. S. L. City, Septem. 7, 1860    Brother Gibson:  Dear Sir:  I received your two letters of   June 15th, and Aug. 7th, respectively; both of which were highly  interesting and edyfying. I read them to Prisident Young and  council, your daughter, Captn. Hooper and many other friends,   who were all highly pleased to hear from you. Your daughter  says she writes you very often.    Your letters please me they shew plainly that the   spirit of your mission is upon you. Your labor in searching  out and stirring up the cold and lukewarm saints in the   various branches through the country was a good work.    Oceanicus' letter to the mountaineer was published  and read with much interest.    That the Japanese ambassadors to the proud  high-minded Americans, could not find a linguist among the  literate of this great nation, who could speak to them without  an interpreter till they met a Latter-day Saint, is rather sig  nificant and adds to the signs that Israel is to be head and  not the tail, and the mighty nations of the earth are begin-  ning to feel a little of the forebodings of this truth, notwith-  standing the present smallness of the little stone or kingdom  which Daniel saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##]    The openings in New York for public lecturing, which  you name, and also publishing truth in such extensive  public works as the new America cy[c]lopedia, rejoices my heart 
 for this is opening wide doors whereby much may be accom-  plished in a short time. Such things will help to ripen the  earth speedily and prepare it for the day of reaping and   leave the nations without excuse in the day of God's visitations  which are nigh the door.    I have felt from the commencement of my acquaint-  ance with you that you are one of the instruments the Lord  will make use of in presenting the principles of eternal   truth before this generation in such a way that they will   have no power to plead ignorance before the Lord whether they  receive or reject your testimony. And I pray the Lord to bless  you and to inspire your heart, nerve your spirit and fully   prepare you to magnify that station which you are destined  to fill before this generation; yes, brother Gibson as the Lord  lives you have a great work to perform in your day and   one too, that will not only cause your heart to rejoice in bearing  testimony of the word of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ and  the principles of life and salvation, but it will cause the hearts of tens  of thousands of the honest of your fellow men to rejoice and be made   glad because of the testimony which you will have power to bear  with your words and pen, it will also cause the ears of the   wicked to tingle and their hearts to be pierced with much sorrow   because of rejecting your testimony and the testimony of others of   the servants of God.    These things are true, they are the strong whisperings  of the holy spirit unto me, and if you are faithful not one   [j]ot

 or title [tittle] shall fall unfulfilled, and the spirit of the Lord will   bear testimony unto you that they are true when you read  these lines. And I would exhort you, bro. Gibson to be   true and faithful unto the Lord your God, call upon him   in mighty prayer, follow the dictates of his holy spirit and  his blessings will increase upon you daily, and the spirit of   the Lord will be like fire shut up in your bones and your   testimony will be strong and powerful before your fellow men   and you will be enabled to say of a truth that you would  rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God and associate with  the Lord's anointed than to partake of all the pleasures that  are found in the tents of wickedness.    It is your privilege to constantly enjoy the Holy   Ghost—to know the mind and will of God concerning you  day by day—to be led by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit   in every act of your life. This spirit will reveal to you   every snare and trap, or evil of any kind that an enemy,   whether it be men or devils shall lay for your feet, and will suggest   a way for your escape.    What great blessings the Gospel of Jesus Christ vouchsafes  to all who obey its simple precepts and keep the commandments   of God; yet how few place themselves in a position to appreciate   these things. But I will stop preaching with my pen and   refer to some items of news.    From the specimen you sent me of the contents of the  American Biographical dictionary, I judge there will be a wide difference  between it and the new American Cyclopedia in carrying inteligence

 THE  DESERET NEWS.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.  No. 18. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 1858. VOL. VIII.      [Column 1]  HISTORY   OF   WILFORD WOODRUFF.  (FROM HIS OWN PEN.)      IN tracing the history of my fathers, I find   it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of  the Woodruff family for more than three gen-  erations.      My great grandfather, Josiah Woodruff,  lived nearly one hundred years, and possessed   an iron constitution and performed a great  amount of manual labor nearly up to the time  of his death. His wife's name was Sarah; she   bore to him nine children as follows:—Josiah,   Appleton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda,  Phebe, and two names not given.      My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the   third son of Josiah. He was born in Farming-  ton, Hartford Co., Connecticut, in 1751; he   also possessed a strong constitution; it was   said that he performed the most labor for   several years of any man in Hartford Co., and  from over exertion in hewing timber he was   attacked with rheumatism in his right hip,   which caused severe lameness for several   years before his death. He married Dinah   Woodford, by whom he had seven children,  viz.:—Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus,  Hellen, and Ozem.      Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Elizabeth,   Amasa Frisby; Samuel, Miss Case; Aphek,  Beulah Thompson and Azubah Hart; Titus,  Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos Wheeler; and   Ozem, Acksah Merrill and Hannah Hart; all   of whom had large families.      My grandfather died in Farmington, with  the spotted fever in 1806, aged 55 years. My   grandmother, Dinah, died in 1824, in the same   place, with a cancer in the left breast: her   sufferings were very great.      My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in   Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah   Thompson, who was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801.   She bore three sons, namely:—Azmon, born   Nov. 29, 1802; Ozen Thompson, born Dec. 22  1804; myself born March 1, 1807.      My mother died with the spotted fever, June   11, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving me fifteen   months old. My father's second wife, Azu-  bah Hart, was born July 31, 1792; they were  married Nov. 9, 1810; they had six children,  viz.: Philo, born Nov. 29, 1811, and died by  poison administered by a physician Nov. 25,   1827; Asahel Hart, born April 11, 1814, and   died in Terrahaute, Oct. 18, 1838; Franklin,   born March 12, 1816, and died June 1; Newton,   born June 19, 1818, drowned Sept., 1820; Ju-  lius, born April 22, 1820, and died in infancy;   Eunice, born June 19, 1821. I married her to   Dwight Webster in Farmington, Conn., Aug.  4, 1841[.]      My father was a strong constitutioned man,   and has done a great amount of labor. At   eighteen years of age, he commenced attending  a flouring and saw mill, and continued about    [Column 2]  50 years; most of this time he labored eight-  een hours a day.      He never made any profession of religion,  until I baptized him with all his household  into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints on the first day of July, 1838. He was  a man of great charity, honesty, integrity and  truth, and made himself poor by giving to the   poor, and accommodating his fellow men by   loaning money and becoming surety for his   neighbors, and always saying yes, to every   man who asked a favor at his hand.      I was born in the north part of the town of   Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford Co.,   Conn., March 1, 1807. I assisted my father   in attending the Farmington Mills, until I was   twenty years of age.      In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill of my   aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I attended three  years. In May, 1830, I took charge of the   flouring mill of Mr. Collins, the ax manufac-  turer, in South Canton, Conn. At the end of   one year it was demolished to make way for   other machinery. In March, 1831, I took   charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. Rich-  ard B. Cowles of New Hartford, Conn. In   the spring of 1832, in company with my oldest   brother, Azmon, I went to Richland, Oswego  Co., New York, and purchased a farm and   saw mill, and settled in business.      At an early age my mind was exercised upon  religious subjects, although I never made a   profession until 1830. I did not then join any  church, for the reason that I could not find any   denomination whose doctrines, faith or prac-  tice, agreed with the gospel of Jesus Christ,  or the ordinances and gifts which the apostles   taught. Although the ministers of the day   taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles   and ordinances, which the ancient saints en-  joyed, were done away and no longer needed,  I did not believe it to be true, only as they  were done away through the unbelief of the   children of men. I believed the same gifts,   graces, miracles and power would be manifest  in one age of the world as in another, when   God had a church upon the earth, and that   the church of God would be re-established   upon the earth, and that I should live to   see it. These principles were rivetted   upon my mind from the perusal of the Old   and New Testament, with fervent prayer  that the Lord would show me what was right   and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-  tion, without any regard to the opinions of   man, and the whisperings of the Spirit of the   Lord for the space of three years, taught me   that he was about to set up his church and   kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I   was taught these things from my youth by   Robert Mason, an aged man, who lived in  Simsbury, Conn., who was frequently called  the old prophet Mason: he taught me many   things which are now coming to pass. He did   not believe that any man had authority to ad-  minister in the ordinances of the gospel, but   believed it was our privilege through faith,  prayer and fasting, to heal the sick, and cast   out devils by the laying on of hands, which   was the case under his administration, as   many could testify.      In 1832, I was inspired to go to Rhode Is-  land; my brother, Asahel, was also directed  by the Spirit of God to go to the same place.   When we met, we both told our impressions,  and it caused us to marvel and wonder, what   the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as   we had made preparations to move to the   west, we let outward circumstances control us,   and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Is-  land, we went to Richland, Oswego Co., New   York, and there remained until Dec. 29, 1833,   when I heard Elders Zerah Pulsipher and   Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Azmon   and I believed their testimony, entertained the   elders and offered ourselves for baptism the  first sermon we heard. We read the Book of   Mormon, and I received a testimony that it   was true.      We soon learned what the Lord wanted of  us in Rhode Island, for at the time we were   warned to go there, two of the elders were    [Column 3]  preaching there, and had we gone, we should   have embraced the work at that time.      Dec. 31—I was baptized by Elder Zerah   Pulsipher; he confirmed me the same evening.      Jan. 2, 1834—I was ordained a teacher, and   my brother Azmon, an elder, and a small   branch organized of 12 members by Elder Pul-  sipher.      In February following, in company with  Elder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the   town of Fabius, to attend an evening meeting   of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pulsi-  pher was presiding; I saw the book of com-  mandments or revelations given through Joseph  Smith, Jr., and I believed them with all my heart  and rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-  eral days, and holding several meetings, we  returned home rejoicing.      During the winter, we were visited by sev-  eral of the elders. Feb. 1st, Elder Parley P.  Pratt called upon us and instructed the branch  till midnight: we had a precious time. I ac-  companied brother Pratt to Jefferson Co., and   told him my circumstances; he said it was my   duty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and   join the camp of Zion. I immediately settled   my business.      April 11, 1834—With my horses and wagon  I took brs. Harry Brown and Warren Ingles,   and started for Zion. I met with Orson Pratt,  John Murdoch and other Elders on the way,   and arrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of   April, 1834.      The Prophet Joseph invited me to make his   house my home; I accepted his offer, and staid  with him about one week. I became acquaint-  ed with many of the High Priests, Elders and   Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and   heard many of the Elders speak, and I felt to   rejoice before God for the light and knowledge   which was manifested to me during that day.      May 1—I started from Kirtland, and went   to New Portage, and remained till all the com-  pany joined us, when we were organized.      March [May] 7—We took up our line of march,   pitching our tents by the way, and traveled to   Missouri.      After we had pitched our tents in Clay coun-  ty (our numbers being 205) and many of the   brethren had taken sick, and some had died,   Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except   enough to take care of the sick; all who had   teams were required to leave the ground and   go among the brethren. I went to br. Ly-  man Wight's, in company with Heman Hyde   and Milton Holmes. Shortly, Joseph called   the brethren together at Lyman Wight's, and   told them if they would humble themselves be-  fore the Lord, and covenant to keep His com-  mandments and obey His counsel, the plague  should be stayed from that hour, and there  should not be another case of cholera in the   camp. The brethren covenanted to do do this  and the plague was stayed and there was not   another case in camp.      Prest. Joseph Smith returned to Kirtland  with many of the brethren, I remained with   Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till the   following winter.      I had a great desire to preach the gospel,   which I did not name to my brethren, but one  Sunday evening I retired into the woods alone,   and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to   open my way to go and preach the gospel to   the inhabitants of the earth; the spirit of the   Lord bore witness that my prayer was heard,   and should be answered. I arose from my   knees happy, and walked some forty rods and   met Elias Higbee, a High Priest, with whom   I had staid a number of months. As I ap-  proached him, he said "Br. Wilford, the Spirit   of the Lord tells me that you should be or-  dained and go on a mission." I replied, "I   am ready."      At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman   Wight's, Clay county, Missouri, Nov. 5, I was  ordained a Priest by Elder Simeon Carter;   Stephen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde were  also ordained Priests.      Bishop Partridge said he would like to have  me go into the Southern States, through Ar-  kansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, and if I    [Column 4]  could find any body who had faith enough to   go with me, for it would be a dangerous coun-  try to travel in, in consequence of the Missou-  ri persecution, to take him. I told him I was   as ready to go South as any where; and asked   if I should go through Jackson county, as it   lay in our route. He replied, it would be at   the risk of life, and he had not faith enough   to undertake it; if I had, I might try it. I also   asked him, if I went through Jackson county,   if I should start without purse or scrip accord-  ing to the law of God. He answered, that he   had not got faith enough to start on a mission  through Jackson county without money, and   if I did it, I must do it on my own faith. I   felt strenuous to keep the commandments, so   I started without money. I called upon Elder   Harry Brown, and asked him to accompany  me; he consented, and Bishop Partridge ap-  pointed him to go with me.      Jan. 13, 1835—I received an honorable dis-  charge from Lyman Wight, certifying that I  had faithfully performed my duties in Zion's   camp.      I took my valise in hand, weighing 15lbs,   mostly books of Mormon, and started in com-  pany with Elder Harry Brown, crossed the   river into Jackson county, and felt thankful.   We bowed our knees, and prayed that God  might protect us from the mob while going   through the country, and that His judgments   might rest upon the wicked who had shed the  blood of the Saints in that land, that the land   might be cleansed from sin. I had a petition   to the Governor of Missouri, for redress of  wrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson county,   for the purpose of obtaining signatures. We   bent our way south, through Jackson county,   without any molestation; yet, in one instance,   we were preserved from a mob of about sixty,  assembled at a grog shop which we had to   pass.      June [January] 18—We called at the Harmony mis-  sion and had an interview with the President,   a Presbyterian minister. Although it was   near sundown he would neither give us any-  thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we were  Mormons. It was fifteen miles to the nearest   house, which was Jerrew's Indian trading   house. We asked the minister to direct us   there. He gave us directions, but the Spirit   said to me he was deceiving us. I asked him   three times, and he declared he was telling us   the truth. We followed his directions and we  came to the Osage river swamp, where we   were lost in darkness of the night. We   followed the river, but as it is very crooked,   we made but little progress. After traveling   through mud and water for one hour, we con-  cluded to go out on the open prairie and lie   down in the grass until morning, but when we   got out into the prairie we heard the Osage In-  dians' drum and shout at the trading house  as they were having a pow-wow. As we ap-  proached, we were met by a dozen large savage  looking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly man-  ner, but did not attempt to bite nor bark. We   arrived about midnight, covered with mud,   hungry and weary, and were kindly received   and entertained for the remainder of the night   by Mr. Jerrew, who had an Osage squaw for   a wife; she prepared us a good supper, but   marvelled that we did not drink coffee. She   proffered us their best bed, which was highly  ornamented, but we declined her kind offer, as   we were wet and muddy; she made us a good   bed of mackinaw blankets before a large fire,   and we slept comfortably. May the Lord re-  ward both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Pres-  byterian minister according to their deserts.      —19—Mr. Jerrew gave us a good breakfast,   put us across the Osage river in a canoe, and   we started upon our long day's walk, it being   sixty miles to the nearest house; we had not   anything with us to eat. Most of our travels   through the day was through prairie; before   dark we entered timbered land; as we ap-  proached the timber a large black bear met   us; we had no weapons. When the bear got   within about six rods of us, he rose upon hi[s]  hind feet and examined us a short time, an[d]  went off. We were soon enveloped in su[ch] [page folded]     
 THE  DESERET NEWS.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.  No. 19. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 14, 1858. VOL VIII.      [Column 1]  HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  (FROM HIS OWN PEN.)  -[CONTINUED.]-      March 2—We cut down a large cotton wood   tree, and in two days dug out a canoe four feet   wide and twelve long, put on a pair of oars  and then rowed down the Arkansas river, 125  miles to Little Rock, begging our food by the  way, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity.   After visiting Little Rock we traveled down   the river ten miles, and tied up our canoe on   the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones. I   preached next day at his house. On the 16th   we left our canoe with Mr. Jones and walked  back up the river ten miles, opposite Little   Rock, and took the old military road, and   started to wade the Mississippi swamp, which   was mostly covered with water from Little   Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, a   distance of about 175 miles. We waded through   mud and water knee deep, day after day, and  in some instances forty miles per day, before   we could get a stopping place.      On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an   attack of the rheumatism and could not travel   fast. My companion, br. Brown, had got in a   hurry, and wished to return to his family in   Kirtland, and as I could not travel as fast as   he wished, we parted. He left me sitting on a   log in the mud and water; I was lame and un-  able to walk, without food, and twelve miles   from the nearest house on the road; he went   out of sight in great haste. I then knelt down   in the water and prayed to the Lord to heal   me. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me,   and I was healed; the pain left me; I arose and   went my way. Whenever I met with one or   more families, I preached and bore testimony  to them.      I crossed the Mississippi river in the even-  ing of the 27th of March, and staid at a pub-  lic house kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I was   suspected of being an impostor. Mr. Jackson   believed I was one of Murrill's clan, who were   then murdering and stealing negroes, and to   test me, he gathered together a large house   full of the most wicked and corrupt people in   the city, and set me to preaching, to see   whether I could preach or not.      I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same   company of men and women will ever meet  together again for the same purpose, for they   would not like again to have their sins and   abominations revealed to each other as point-  edly as I told them that night, through the in-  spiration of the Holy Ghost; they were glad   to get rid of me upon almost any terms.      I traveled from Memphis to Middle Tennes-  see.      April 4—I met with Elder Warren Parrish   in Benton county. He and David W. Patten   had labored together through the winter in   Tennessee, and baptized twenty persons. El-  der Patten had returned to Kirtland. I joined  Elder Parrish and we labored together over   three months, traveling and preaching daily,  baptizing such as would receive our testimony,  extending our labors in Tennessee and Ken-  tucky.      June 23—We received a letter from Oliver  Cowdery, requesting Elder Parrish to come to   Kirtland, and for me to remain and take   charge of the southern churches, and the Lord   would bless me in so doing.      June 28—Warren Parrish ordained me an   Elder. We baptized some forty persons while   laboring together.      July 23—Elder Parrish left. I traveled   alone through the year, and extended my labors   both in Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptized  forty-three persons during this season, thirty-  one after br. Parrish left.      Nov. 15—While traveling in the night with   br. Benjamin L. Clapp and others, a tremend-  ous storm of wind and rain overtook us. We  came to a creek which had swollen to such an  extent by the rain that we could not cross   without swimming our horses; several of the   company were females. We undertook to head    [Column 2]  the stream, to ford it, but in the attempt, in   the midst of the darkness and the raging of   the wind and rain, we were lost in the thick   woods, amidst the rain, wind, creeks and fal-  len tree tops; we crossed streams nearly twen-  ty times. I was reminded of Paul's perils by   water; but the Lord was merciful unto us in   the midst of our troubles, for while we were   groping in the dark, running the risk of killing   both ourselves and animals by riding off pre-  cipitous bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone   round about us, and revealed our perilous situ-  ation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf.   The light continued with us until we found a   house and learned the right road; then the   light disappeared, and we were enabled to   reach the house of br. Henry Thomas at nine   o'clock, all safe, having rode twenty miles,  five hours in the storm, and we felt to thank   the Lord for our preservation.      During the winter and spring I continued to   labor mostly alone, through Kentucky and   Tennessee, opening new places, preaching   daily, baptizing, confirming and organizing   new branches.      Feb. 26, 1836—At a conference held at br.  B. L. Clapp's, in Callaway county, Kentucky,   I ordained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyd-  ston Elders, and B. L. Clapp and Daniel Thomas  Priests.      Brs. Smoot and Clapp both entered into the   labors of the ministry. Elder Smoot frequent-  ly accompanied me on my mission. Elder D.  W. Patten returned to Tennessee in April, and   joined us in our labors, accompanied by his   wife. It was a happy meeting. He related   to me the blessings he had received in Kirtland   during the endowments. We traveled and la-  bored together; persecution raged against us.   Elder Patten bore a strong and forcible testi-  mony of the work of God, and when we were   opposed by mobs he would rebuke them in  great plainness; we were threatened, but not   injured. The sick were healed under our ad-  ministrations.      May 27—Elder Warren Parrish arrived   from Kirtland. We held a conference on the   28th, at br. Seth Utley's. Seven branches were   represented containing 116 members. Abel  Wilson and Jesse Turpin were ordained Priests  and Albert Petty a Teacher.      —31—I was ordained by David W. Patten  a member of the second quorum of Seventies.      We labored over a circuit of several hundred   miles; br. Smoot labored with us, and br. Clapp   frequently. We traveled two by two, and all   met together to hold conferences.      June 19—A States warrant was issued  against D. W. Patten, Warren Parrish and   Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by Matthew   Williams, a Methodist priest, and served by   the sheriff, Robert C Petty. Elders Patten   and Parrish were taken by an armed mob of   about fifty, under pretence of law, led by the  sheriff, a colonel, first and second major, with   other officers, and a Methodist priest with a   gun upon his shoulder. I was in another coun-  ty and therefore not taken. We were accused   of prophesying falsely, by saying that four   persons who were baptized should receive the   Holy Ghost in twenty-four hours, and that   Christ should come the second time before this   generation passed away. The whole concern   was a mob mock trial, contrary to law, justice,   judgment or truth.      On the 29th, I went to a Baptist meeting  house, on Thompson's creek, to preach; the  house was crowded. As I rose to speak, a   Baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the   door on horseback, and stepped in greatly agi-  tated, and told the deacon to forbid my preach-  ing in the house; at the same time commenced   a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, telling  several lies, which I corrected before the peo-  ple, which increased his rage. As I was for-  bidden to preach in the house, and had been   invited, and traveled many miles to fulfil my  appointment, I told the people I would like to   preach and was willing to stand on a wood  pile, a fence, a cart, or any place they would  appoint. A man rose and said he owned the   land in front of the meeting house, and I might    [Column 3]  stand and preach on that, and welcome. All   the congregation, with the exception of the   minister and one deacon, arose and left the   house, walked across the street and formed   seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention   while I preached for an hour and a half on the  principles of the gospel.      When I closed, Mr. Randolph Alexander,   who had never heard a Mormon Elder speak   before, said, the people of the present day   made him think of a pen of hogs; the keeper  would make a trough, and pour into it hot or  cold water, dish water or anything else, and  they would drink it; but let a stranger come   along and pour over a basket of corn on the   back side of the pen, and the hogs would be  frightened and run and snort all over the pen.   He said it was so with the people; the priests  would feed them with any kind of doctrine,  no matter how false, the people will swallow   it down, but let a stranger come and preach  the gospel of Jesus Christ, which will save  the people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and the  people are afraid of him.      Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a   Book of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and   several others followed his example.      July 14—I wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery,   and sent him a list of subscribers for the Mes-  senger and Advocate, and a detail of my mission  in the South.      —18—I rode in company with A. O. Smoot  to a ferry on the Tennessee River. The fer-  ryman was absent. We were offered the use   of the boat, and ferried ourselves; but not   being much used to the business, and losing   one oar in the river, and having to row with a   broken oar, we landed a great distance below  the usual place with a high circulation of   blood and blistered hands; but our horses leapt  the bank, and we went on our way to the   Sandy, which we swam, and spent the night at   Thomas Frazer's.      —30—We preached at Mr. David Crider's,   also on Sunday, the 31st, where we were  threatened by a mob. I baptized Mr. Crider   amid the scoffs of the rabble, who went in the   night and poisoned both of our horses; the one   which I rode, belonging to bro. Samuel West,  died in two days afterwards; brother Smoot's   recovered; the swine that eat of the horse   flesh also died.      Aug. 11—I met with D. W. Patten and   wife; he and bro. Parrish had been driven out  of Benton into Henry Co., and Elder Parrish  had left for Kirtland.      —29—We were visited by Elders T. B.   Marsh and E. H. Groves, from Caldwell Co.,   Mo.      Sept. 2—We held a conference at Damon's   Creek, Callaway Co., Kentucky; several   branches were represented, containing 119   members; Johnson F. Lane, Benj. L. Clapp  and Randolph Alexander were ordained elders,  and Lindsey Bradey a priest by D. W. Patten,   who baptized five at the close of the confer-  ence.      I was released from my labors in the South,  and counselled to go to Kirtland and receive  my endowments, as was also A. O. Smoot.      Sept. 19—Elders Marsh and D. W. Patten   and wife, and E. H. Groves, started for Far   West. I organized the first company of Saints,  who emigrated from the Southern States, which   numbered twenty-two souls. I appointed El-  der Boydston president of the company, and   counselled them to be united, and to remember  their prayers night and day before the Lord.      —20—The camp started. I spent a few   days visiting the branches; baptized and con-  firmed eight, and obtained thirty subscribers   for the Messenger and Advocate.      Oct. 20—In company with A. O. Smoot and   Jesse Turpin, I started for Kirtland; this was   the first time I had ever traveled on a steam-  boat. We left the steamer at Louisville on   the 28th, and spent nineteen days visiting El-  der Smoot's relations and preaching among the   people; we visited the Big Bone Lick. We ar-  rived in Cincinnati Nov. 17, where we saw   thirteen persons dead and wounded taken from   the steamer Flora, which had burst her pipes    [Column 4]  while running a race; arrived in Kirtland on  the 25th, and had the happy privilege of meet-  ing the Prophet Joseph, and many elders, with   whom I was acquainted in the camp of Zion.  29th, I heard Joseph preach in the Temple.   In the afternoon I was called to speak and   read the ##Isaiah 56|56th chap.## of Isaiah, and made some  remarks, and gave an account of my mission   in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the   Saints.      I was counselled by the Presidency to at-  tend the school in the Temple, taught by Prof.  Haws. I studied the Latin language and Eng-  lish Grammar, and boarded with bro. Ira   Bond.      I attended meetings with the Seventies and   other quorums during the winter of 1836-7, and   received much valuable instruction.      Dec. 20, 1836—I was present at the organ-  ization of the third quorum of Seventies; there  were twenty-seven ordained.      Jan. 3, 1837—I was set apart to be a mem-  ber of the first quorum of Seventies.      —25—At early candle light, a cloud began   to arise in the north east and reached to the  north west, having the appearance of fire, and  it soon spread over the whole horizon. The   reflection of the clouds upon the earth, which  was covered with snow, had a blood red ap-  pearance. It commenced at about 6 o'clock,  and lasted till past 10 p.m.      —29—Prests. Joseph Smith and O. Cow-  dery addressed the Saints in the Temple. Jo-  seph blessed the people in the name of the  Lord, and said, if we would be faithful, we  should arise above our embarrassments and be   delivered from the hands of our enemies.      —30—I wrote an article on faith, which  was published in the Messenger and Advocate.      Feb. 19—I attended meeting at the Temple.   Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on busi-  ness for the church, but not half as long as  Moses was in the mount away from Israel;   yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they   did not make a calf to worship as did the  Israelites, turned their hearts away from the   Lord and from his servant Joseph, and had   engaged in speculation and given away to   false spirits, until they were darkened in their   minds; and many were opposed to Joseph   Smith, and some wished to appoint David   Whitmer to lead the church in his stead. In  the midst of this cloud of dark spirits, Joseph   returned to Kirtland, and this morning arose  in the stand. He appeared much depressed;   but soon the Spirit of God rested upon him,   and he addressed the assembly in great plain-  ness for about three hours, and put his enemies  to silence. When he arose he said, "I am still   the President, Prophet, Seer, Revelator and   Leader of the church of Jesus Christ. God,   and not man, has appointed and placed me   in this position, and no man or set of men  have power to remove me or appoint another  in my stead, and those who undertake this, if   they do not speedily repent, will burn their  fingers and go to hell.["] He reproved the people   sharply for their sins, darkness and unbelief;   the power of God rested upon him, and bore  testimony that his sayings were true.      March 23rd, was spent in the Temple by the   Saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer. Pat-  riarch Joseph Smith, sen., presided. The  Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the  people; a contribution was taken up for the  poor.      April 4—I received my washings and an-  ointings in the house of the Lord. I spent the  whole night in the Temple, with others of the   Seventies, in prayer and fasting, the Spirit of  the Lord rested upon us. After twenty-four   hours I partook of food.      —6—The Presidency of the Church, the   Twelve Apostles, and other quorums, met in   solemn assembly, and sealed upon our heads,  our washings, anointings and blessings with a   loud shout of hosannah to God and the Lamb;  the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After   spending three hours in the upper room, the   quorums repaired to the lower court; the vails   were lowered, and the ordinance of washing   of feet was administered. Elder H. C. Kim-

(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)    -[CONTINUED.]-      MAY 31—I left my wife and friends in Kirt-  land, and walked to Fairport with bro. Hale;   we were joined by Milton Holmes, and took   the steamer Sandusky and arrived in Buffalo  June 1st, and Syracuse on the 4th; walked 36  miles to Richland, Oswego Co., N. Y., and   called upon my two brothers, Azmon and   Thompson, whom I had not seen for several   years. We visited the churches as far as   Sackett's Harbor, called upon Archibald Pat-  ten, and delivered to him some letters from   Warren Parrish, in which were enclosed many   one hundred dollar bills, which he had taken   from the Kirtland Bank.      We crossed Lake Ontario, visited Upper   Canada, and attended a conference, May [June] 10th,   with Elders John E. Page and James Blakesly,   in the township of Bastard, Leeds Co. There   were eight branches represented, containing   300 members, 13 elders, 5 priests, 8 teachers   and 6 deacons. Elder Wm. Draper and my-  self ordained 7 elders, 9 priests, 11 teachers  and 5 deacons: five were baptized by Elder   Page at the close of the conference.      A woman was possessed of the devil and   greatly afflicted, much of the time was dumb;   four of us laid hands upon her, and cast the   devil out in the name of Jesus Christ, and she   was made whole, and gave thanks unto God,   and went on her way rejoicing.      We visited several other branches and  preached the word of God, and several of the   sick were healed.      We returned to Kingston, took steamer for   Oswego, and canal for Albany; bros. John   Goodson, Isaac Russell and John Snider ac-  companied us from Canada, and left us at   Schenectady, to join Elders Kimball, Hyde   and Richards at New York, to go to England.      We walked from Albany to Farmington,   Conn.; attended a conference of the Saints in  Canaan; arrived at my father's house July   6th. This was the first time I had seen my   father or relatives in Conn., since I joined the   church; they received me kindly. On the 10th,   I preached in the City Hall in Colinsville, and   a mob gathered and attempted to break up the  meeting, with fife and drum, hollowing and   yelling; they were urged on by a Presbyterian   priest. At the close of the meeting the priest  came to me with his rabble, and asked many  questions; he said I had no right to my opinion,   and no man had a right to preach the gospel   unless he had a collegiate education. I told   him I would admit that point when he would   tell me at what college Jesus Christ and his   apostles obtained their education: the priest   and rabble then left.      —12—I preached in a schoolhouse in West   Avon to an attentive congregation; after meet-  ing I baptized my uncle, Ozem Woodruff, his   wife and son, John, in fulfillment of a dream   which I had at ten years of age.      I visited most of my relatives in Conn., and  preached the gospel to them.      —16—I preached at Adna Hart's in Avon,  where I was met by my step-mother and sis-  ter, also by my wife, who had travelled alone   from Kirtland, and was on her way to visit  her father in Maine.      —19—Elder Hale went to New Rowley,  Mass., to visit his friends. I had been soli-  cited to preach to the citizens of Farmington  by many prominent men, but every room which  was offered me, including the town hall, was   closed against me by the Rev. Noah Porter,   pastor of the Presbyterian church, until the  Methodist church was offered me, which he  had not influence to close. Two hours after I   gave out the appointment, the house was filled,  and I preached to a very attentive congrega-  tion, including my father and his household,   for an hour and a half, upon the first princi-  ples of the gospel; I gave liberty to the assem-  bly to ask any questions, or find any fault with   what I had said, but I met with no opposition.      [Column 2]  —20—I left my father's house, and, with   my wife, rode by stage to Hartford.      —21—Not having money to pay the fare   for us both, I paid her fare in the stage to New   Rowley, Mass., and I walked through a hot  sultry day fifteen hours, averaging three and  a half miles per hour, making 52 miles.      —22—I walked 48 miles.      —23—I walked 36 miles, and arrived at   Elder Nathaniel Holmes', in New Rowley, at   2 o'clock, p.m., making 136 miles in a little   over two days and a half. I met with my   wife and Elder Milton Holmes, at his father's   house: I spent several days in preaching to the   Saints in that region.      Aug. 1—We left New Rowley, and was   joined by Elder Hale, who accompanied us to   Saco, Maine.      —7—I accompanied my wife to her father's,  in Scarborough, Maine. We were kindly re-  ceived: it was the first time I had seen any of   her relations. We found mother Carter very   sick. I spent several days visiting the Saints  in that region.      —10—I accompanied Ezra and Fabien   Carter, my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excur-  sion; we caught with hooks 250 cod fish, had-  dock, and hake, and saw four whales; it being  the first time I had ever seen that class of fish   that swallowed Jonah.      —18—With Elder Hale, I started to fill my   mission on Fox Islands; we walked to Port-  land, and spent the night at Mr. Samuel   Hale's.      —19—We took the steamer Bangor 85  miles to Owl's Head, where we arrived at sun-  set, without means to prosecute our journey   further. We retired to a high hill, and bowed  before the Lord, and prayed that he would   open our way; the Spirit of the Lord rested   upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers   would be answered. As we arose from our   knees, a sloop came into the harbor; we went   to the captain, and enquired where he was   going; he replied, through the channel of   Vinal Haven; he took us on board and landed   us on North Fox Islands, at 2 a.m. on the   20th. We wandered in the dark about an   hour, rambling over rocks and bushes, found the  house of Mr. Nathaniel Dyer, and were enter-  tained. It being Sunday morning, Mr. Benj.  Kent piloted us to the Baptist meeting-house,  occupied by Elder Gideon J. Newton, pastor   of the only religious denomination upon the  island. At the door, I sent for the deacon,  and told him I wished him to inform the min-  ister that we were servants of God, and wish-  ed to deliver a message to that people. The  minister sent word for us to come into the pul-  pit; accordingly, with valize in hand, we walk-  ed up into the pulpit, and took a seat on each   side of him. When he closed his discourse,   he asked me what hour we would like to   speak; I told him at five; he gave out our ap-  pointment, and invited us to his house. I   asked him how many school houses were on   the island; he said four, and gave me their  names. I asked him if they were free for any  one to preach in; he answered in the affirma-  tive. I took out my Bible, Book of Mormon,   and Doctrine and Covenants, and laid them all   upon his stand; he promised to read them.  The hour of meeting arrived, and I preached  to a full house upon the first principles of the   gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord had   raised up a prophet, and had commenced to   establish his church and kingdom again upon  the earth, in fulfillment of his word, as spoken   through the ancient prophets and apostles.   This was the first discourse ever delivered by   any Latter-day Saint upon this chain of is-  lands; Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out   appointments for preaching in the four school  houses. The people came out en masse to in-  vestigate the principles which we taught. In   fourteen days we preached nineteen discourses.   Capt. Justice Ames and wife were baptized   by Elder Hale. Elder Newton, the Baptist  minister, with his family, attended twelve of   our meetings, read the books, and was con-  vinced by the Spirit of the Lord that our doc-  trine was true, and he had a hard struggle in    [Column 3]  his mind to know which to do, receive it or re-  ject it; he finally resolved to reject it, and   commenced preaching against us. He sent for   Mr. Douglass, Methodist minister, on the   South Island, to come and help him; he had  been long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but   they became very friendly and united in a war   against us. We continued preaching daily  until we baptized most of the members of Mr.   Newton's church, and those who owned the  meeting house.      I followed Mr. Douglas to his own island,   and commenced preaching to his church, and  baptized a good share of his members, among   whom were several sea captains. Ministers   from the main land were sent for, who came  over and tried to put a stop to the work by  preaching and lying about us; but the work   continued to roll on. They wished me to work  a miracle to convince them that my doctrine  was true. I told them they had rejected the   truth, and they would see signs, but not unto   salvation.      Vinal Haven, which includes both north and   south Fox Island, is in lat. 44°, long. 69° 10'.   The inhabitants are generally healthy and in-  dustrious, and hospitable to strangers. The peo-  ple obtain most of their wealth by fishing, and  fit out annually over one hundred licensed ves-  sels, beside many smaller crafts. The north   island is nine miles long and two wide; popu-  lation 800, and contains a post office, a store, a  grist mill, four school houses, and a Baptist   church. The land is rocky and rough, yet  there are farms which produce good wheat,  barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principal   timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. The   rasp and gooseberry grow in great abundance.   Sheep are the principal stock.      South Fox island is about ten miles long and   five wide, and is a mass of rocks, principally   granite, formed into shelves, hills, hollows,  and cut up into nooks, points and ravines by  coves and harbors; population, 1000. There  are some small patches under cultivation, at   the expense of great labor and toil. Many   resident fishermen fish at Newfoundland, and   bring them home, and dry them upon flakes;   they annually supply the market with a great   amount of cod fish, mackerel and boxed her-  ring. The latter island contains two stores,   three tide saw mills, six school houses, a small  branch of the Methodist church and a priest.  The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and  birch, also gooseberries, raspberries, whortle-  berries and upland cranberries; bushes and   timber grow out of the crevices of the rocks.      There is a great amount and variety of fish  in the waters around these islands, viz.: whale,   black fish, shark, ground shark, pilot fish,  horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,  cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, macker-  el, shad, bass, alewives, herring, pohagen,  dolphin, whiting, frost fish, flounders, smelt,   skate, shrimp, shad, cusk, bluebacks, scollop,   dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-  gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish, swordfish,  thrasher, cat, scuppog, twotog, eyefish, cunner,  ling eels, lobsters, clams, mussels, winkles,   porpoises, seals, &c. &c.      Sept. 6—The harbor was filled with a   school of mackerel, which were caught in   great numbers by the people standing upon the   wharf.      While standing upon the farm of Eleazar   Carver on the north island I counted fifty five   islands, many of which were inhabited.      Oct. 2—I left the island with Elder Hale;  Capt. Ames took us to Thomastown in a sloop.      —3—We walked forty six miles to Bath.      —4—We attended a Baptist convention,   and preached to a large congregation in the   evening in Pierce's hall; the people listened   attentively.      —5—We walked thirty six miles to Port-  land.      —6—Walked ten miles to father Carter's   in Scarborough, where I found my wife and  friends well.      —9—I parted with Elder Hale, who re-  turned to Kirtland. I continued preaching   through various towns on the main land until    [Column 4]  Nov. 2, when I again returned to Fox Islands,  accompanied by my wife.      —15—I visited the Isle of Holt, twelve   miles east, and preached to an attentive con-  gregation, leaving them the Book of Mormon,   which they promised to read. I returned on  the 16th.      I continued my labors during the winter of   1837-8, and nearly every person had attended   my meetings, and taken sides for or against.   Our enemies made attempts to break up our   meetings.      Jan. 15, 1838—A company of sailors be-  longing to the United States revenue cutter,   brought on shore a swivel and joined the mob,  parading near the house where I was preach-  ing, and discharged it several times, accom-  panied with small arms, with the intention of   breaking up the meeting. Some of the mob   gathered around to see what effect this would  have. I warned them in the name of the Lord,   and proclaimed the judgments of God that  awaited the wicked, and shook my garments  in the presence of the people, and told them I   was clear of their blood; but they only heard  my voice intermingled with the roar of cannon  and musketry. Before I closed speaking, the   sailors went back on board the revenue cutter.  At the close of the meeting I baptized two,   also one next day, and while baptizing, the  mob again commenced firing guns. The Bap-  tists and Methodists got up the mob. Mr.   Douglas, the Methodist priest, when argument  failed him, applied to all the magistrates for   warrants against me; they refused to grant   them as he had no cause of complaint.      Feb. 13—I crossed in the mail boat to  Hampden and ordained James Townsend; we   walked together through deep snows, and   visited and preached in the towns of Sears-  mont, Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hamp-  den, and twice in the city hall in Bangor, to  large assemblies, and returned to Fox Islands   via Casteem and the Isle of Holt. Arrived in   Vinal Haven March 8. Elder Townsend re-  turned home.      March 22—I accompanied br. Stirrat, at   low tide, on to a bar some forty rods from   shore, to dig some clams. We were soon join-  ed by Mrs. Woodruff and sister Stone, who   had a curiosity to see how clams were dug.   The ground for about twelve rods nearer shore   was several feet lower than the point we were   on, but we were so busily engaged we did not  observe the flowing tide until we were sur-  rounded by water, and having no boat, our only   alternative was to wade ashore and carry the   women, which we safely accomplished amid   the reflection that tide nor time waited for no   man.      April 4—Mr. Kent, the postmaster, showed   me a letter containing two sheets of foolscap  signed by Warren Parrish and several of the  Twelve, who had apostatized and been cut off   from the church. The communication was   full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph   Smith and all that stood by him. It was sent   with the intention of breaking up the work  upon these islands.      —11—I was visited by Elders Townsend   and Milton Holmes, who attended conferences  with me upon both islands, and bore their tes-  timony to the people, but the spirit of oppo-  sition increased to a great height. I was   warned by the Spirit of the Lord to leave for a  season and take a western mission. After  visiting the Saints from house to house, and   praying with and encouraging them, I left on  the 28th and went to the main land with Elders   Townsend and Holmes. Mrs. Woodruff re-  turned to her father's. We walked to Scar-  borough. I left May 7th, and walked to Brad-  ford, where I left Elder Holmes, and proceed-  ed to Boston.      May 11—I gave out an appointment to preach   at sister Vose's room, and I went to Cambridge-  port to visit Elder A. P. Rockwood, who had   been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,  but in reality out of religious persecution.   The jailor locked me in until ten p.m.; but   while it disappointed a congregation of people,  it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood,     
 THE  DESERET NEWS.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.  No. 21. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 28, 1858. VOL. VIII.      [Column 1]  HISTORY  OF   WILFORD WOODRUFF.  (FROM HIS OWN PEN.)    -[CONTINUED.]-      March 8, 1839—I attended a conference at   Springfield, Illinois.      —13—I took my family and started for   Quincy, where I arrived on the 16th. I dined   with Emma Smith at Judge Cleveland's. I  then went on to the bank of the river near   Quincy, and saw a great many of the Saints,   old and young, lying in the mud and water, in   a rain storm, without tent or covering, which  suffering was caused by the unhallowed perse-  cution of the State of Missouri. The sight  filled my eyes with tears, while my heart was  made glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints in  the midst of their affliction.      —17 (Sunday) —I had an interview with   President Brigham Young and John Taylor.   We held a meeting with the Saints; $50 and a   number of teams were raised to bring out the  remainder of the poor from Missouri. Prest.  Young counseled the Twelve to locate their  families for the time being in Quincy. I re-  turned to Rochester for my effects. While at   Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the   Saints in Quincy, which I sent to them. I re-  turned to Quincy on the 8th of April, where I   left my family, and went to Far West with the   Twelve and attended the conference on the   Temple block on the 26th, where I was or-  dained one of the Twelve Apostles, on the   corner stone of the Temple, under the hands  of the Twelve, Elder Brigham Young being  mouth. Elder G. A. Smith was also ordained   at the same time. We returned to Quincy on   the 2nd day of May.      On the 3rd, in company with five of the  Twelve, I went to Judge Cleveland's, and had   a happy interview with Prest. Joseph Smith,   who had just escaped out of the hands of his  persecutors in Missouri; it was the first time  I had seen him for more than two years, and it   was a happy meeting. I attended the confer-  ence and meetings with the Saints in Quincy  until the 15th, when I moved my family to   Montrose, and occupied a room in the barracks   with Prest. Young and family. I spent my  time in attending the meetings, councils and  conferences. I wrote in my journal the teach-    [Column 2]  ings, sayings and prophecies of Joseph from   time to time, as I had opportunity.      July 22—I was with Prest. Joseph Smith  and his council and the Twelve: it was a day   of God's power with the Prophet. He healed   many who were sick nigh unto death, among  whom were Elijah Fordham and Joseph B.   Nobles; even the wicked rabble followed to  see the sick healed. As Joseph was about to   cross the river a man came to him and asked   him if he would go about three miles and heal  two of his small children, who were twins,  about three months old, and were sick nigh  unto death. He was a man of the world; he  had never heard a sermon preached by a Latter-  day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but   he would send a man. After hesitating a mo-  ment, he turned to me and said, "You go with   this man and heal his children"—at the same   time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and   said, "After you lay hands upon them, wipe  their faces with it, and they shall be healed;  and as long as you will keep that handkerchief  it shall ever remain as a league between you   and me." I went and did as I was command-  ed, and the children were healed.      On the 25th, I was attacked with chills and  fever. I had a chill every other day and was   very sick.      Aug. 8—I laid my hands upon my wife and  children, blessed them, committed them into   the hands of God, and started upon my Eng-  lish mission, leaving my family sick, and with   not more than four days' provisions. Br. Brig-  ham Young rowed me across the Mississippi   in a boat; I was sick and feeble. When I   landed I laid down upon the bank of the river   on a side of sole leather. The Prophet Joseph  came along and looked at me and said, "You   are starting on your mission." I said yes, but   I look like a poor instrument for a missionary;  I look more fit for a hospital or dissecting room  than a mission. He replied, "What do you   say that for? Go ahead in the name of the  Lord, and you shall be healed and blessed on   your mission." I thanked him. A brother   came along with a wagon and carried me a   few miles on my road. I started without purse   or scrip, and passed by Parley P. Pratt, who  was hewing logs for a house; he was bare-  footed, bare-headed, without coat or vest on.   He said, "I have no money, but I have an   empty purse; I will give you that." I went a   few rods and found Elder H. C. Kimball build-  ing a log cabin; he said, "I have one dollar; I   will give you that to put in your purse." He   blessed me and I went my way, accompanied  by Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the   ague every other day and lay on the bottom of   the wagon while I traveled.      We staid with Samuel H. and Don Carlos   Smith at Macomb, and held a meeting with  the Saints, who contributed $9 to our neces-  sities, and George Miller gave us a horse.   Father Coltrin was going east; he took us into   his wagon to help up us along. We spent five  days in Springfield, where Elder Taylor print-  ed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet upon  the Missouri persecution. We sold our horse,   and left on the 21st and continued our journey.   We spent the night of the 24th with Dr. Modi-  sett, of Terrehaute.      On the 28th, while traveling, Elder Taylor  fell to the ground as though he had been  knocked down. We administered to him, and   he revived. On the following day he fell again,   and fainted several times; it seemed as though  the destroyer would take his life; we traveled   with him four days after he was taken sick.   His sickness proved to be bilious fever. We  stopped with him two days, at a German   tavern, in Germantown, Wayne county, In-  diana, with a kind family, with whom he was   acquainted. Father Coltrin would stay no   longer; I proposed to remain with br. Taylor,   but as I was sick with fever and ague, and not  able to take care of myself, br. Taylor advised   me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin,   saying, "it is easier to take care of one sick   man than two." I committed him into the   hands of God; and the family promised to do    [Column 3]  all in their power to make him comfortable.   I parted from him with a heavy heart.      Sept. 2—I continued my journey with Father   Coltrin to Cleveland, Ohio. I there took   steamer on the 10th for Buffalo; had a severe  gale, and did not reach Buffalo until the 12th.   I traveled to Albany on a canal boat; had the  ague daily, was very sick; had no companion  except sectarian priests, who were daily lying   about the Mormons. I took stage at Albany  for Farmington, Connecticut, on the night of   the 19th, and rode all night and the following  day; suffered severely with fever and ague. I  arrived at my father's house in Farmington on   the 21st, quite sick. I found my father and   family well.      On the 27th Sept., 1839, my maternal grand-  mother, Anna Thompson, died, aged 84; I was   too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular   incident that my grandfather, Lot Thompson,  and Anna Thompson, his wife, Samuel Thomp-  son and Mercy Thompson, all of one family,   died in their 84th year.      On the 4th October, Adner Hart, brother to  my step-mother, died, aged 43. He requested  me to preach his funeral sermon. I had been  sick at my father's house with the ague for  fifteen days, attended with a severe cough,   and the hour appointed for the funeral was the  time for my ague, yet I attended the funeral  and preached, and I had no more ague for   many days. I left on the 7th, and visited   New York, Long Island, and New Jersey, in   very poor health.      Nov. 1—I assisted Elders Clark, Wright  and Mulliner to set sail for England. Elder  John Taylor had recovered from his sickness,  and arrived in New York on the 13th Decem-  ber.      Dec. 19—In company with Elders John   Taylor and Theodore Turley, I went on board   the packet ship Oxford, and sailed for Liver-  pool, where I landed January 11, 1840, in good  health and spirits. When I left my father, he  gave me some money to assist in paying my  passage; also gave me five dollars which he re-  quested me to keep until I arrived in Liverpool,   saying, I would there need it. This I found to  be true after landing; that money was all we   had to pay our expenses to Preston, and we  had twopence left.      We arrived in Preston on the 13th. Had a  happy interview with br. Willard Richards;   held a council, and agreed that Elder Taylor   go to Liverpool, Turley to Birmingham, and I   to Staffordshire Potteries.      Jan. 18—I arrived in Manchester; met Elder  Wm. Clayton, who presided over that branch,   numbering 164 members. I was immediately   called upon to visit a woman possessed with   the devil; she was raging and foaming and had  to be held by four men. The more we rebuked  the devil the worse she raged. We continued  to pray and administer until we cast the devil  out. She arose and gave thanks to the Lord.   The devil then entered into a young child, and  we cast him out. I preached several times,   and laid hands on twenty-eight persons. I   went to Burslem on the 21st and met with  Elder Alfred Cordon, president of the Burslem   branch, which numbered 66. I commenced   preaching in the Staffordshire Potteries. El-  der Turley left for Birmingham on the 29th.  I remained in the Potteries some forty days,   preaching, baptizing and confirming, and bless-  ing children.      March 1—As I met in the evening with a  large assembly in Hanley, the Lord revealed   unto me that it would be the last meeting that  I would hold with the Saints in the Potteries   for many days; I told the people it was the   last meeting I should hold with them for a   season; it created much excitement. I had   appointments out for a week, which I got bro.  Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in pray-  er, and asked him where I should go; the  Spirit said, "Go to the south." According to   the directions of the Spirit, on the 3rd, I went   to Herefordshire, and called upon John Ben-  bow at Castlefroom; I found a people prepared  for the gospel. I preached twice at his house.   On the 6th, I baptized six persons, including    [Column 4]  John Benbow and wife. I here found a society   called "United Brethren," numbering about   six hundred members, and about fifty preach-  ers; Thos. Kington was the presiding elder.   They came from all quarters to hear me preach,  and believed my testimony; and I preached   and baptized daily. The ministers of the  Church of England sent three church clerks to  see what I was doing, and I baptized them.   One constable came to arrest me for preaching,   and I baptized him. In about thirty days I  baptized 160, forty eight of whom were preach-  ers of the United Brethren, including their   presiding elder, Thomas Kington.      I established forty two preaching places,  licensed according to law.      On the 9th April, I had an apointment at   Haw Cross. As I was going into the meeting,   letters were put into my hands from Elder  Brigham Young and others, informing me of   his arrival with five of the Twelve, and re-  questing me to come to Preston, and attend a  general conference. A vast assembly had  gathered to attend my meeting; the house, yard,  and street were crowded; a mob had also   gathered. I preached to the people; five came  forward to be baptized. The mob surrounded   the pool, armed with stones. I dismissed the   meeting, and went away; but the congrega-  tion and mob remained on the ground till mid-  night; and as there was no prospect of their   dispersing, and the candidates were anxious to  be baptized, I went down into the water and   baptized five in the midst of a shower of  stones. The water was all in a foam for a   rod around me. None that I baptized were   hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip   and once on my head; the blow on my head   raised a large bump, which went away while   I was confirming: subsequently I baptized  many of the mob.      I left next morning for Preston, and attended  the conference with the Twelve, and returned  to Herefordshire, accompanied by Elder Brig-  ham Young, on the 22nd April, and was soon  joined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder   Young remained twenty seven days, preaching,   baptizing, confirming and counseling. Num-  bers were added daily to the church: he then  returned to Manchester.      I spent about seven months in Herefordshire,   Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. We  baptized over eighteen hundred, including all  of the United Brethren save one. We bap-  tized over two hundred preachers of various   denominations in that part of the vineyard.   A synod of church ministers became so alarm-  ed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard,   they petitioned Parliament to adopt measures  to stop our preaching. They received for an  answer, that if they were as well acquainted  with the Bible as their hunting grounds, and   were as much interested in the welfare of the   souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and   foxes, they would not lose so many of their   congregations.      Aug. 18—I visited London in company with   Elders H. C. Kimball and G. A. Smith. I   labored with them in establishing a church,  spending over five months in that populous city.      We visited nearly every part of the city, and   all the notable places that we could have  access to.      I attended all the general conferences in   England, and set sail with my brethren of the  Twelve on the ship Rochester, April 20, 1841;  arrived in New York May 20.      I went to Scarborough, Maine, after my  wife, and also my son, Wilford, who was born  March 22, 1840. My daughter, Sarah Emma,  had died July 17, 1840.      I returned to New York, and started for   Nauvoo, via the Lakes; was wrecked on Lake  Michigan in the steamer Chesapeake, but ar-  rived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when I  had the happy privilege of meeting with the  Prophets Joseph and Hyrum, and my brethren  of the Twelve.      I bought a log house of brother Tracy, on  lot No. 1, block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durfee  Streets. Prest. Joseph Smith afterwards gave  me the lot.     
 THE  DESERET NEWS.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.  No. 22. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1858. VOL. VIII.      [Column 1]  HISTORY  OF  WILFORD WOODRUFF.  (FROM HIS OWN PEN.)    -[CONTINUED.]-  CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.  -[Written at Great Salt Lake City, February, 1858.]-      VARIED and diverse are the lives and for-  tunes of men; while the paths of some are   strewn with flowers and ease from the cradle   to the grave, with naught to disturb their  peace; others are marked victims of varied  misfortunes, accidents and dangers. The last  named class is the one in whose ranks I have   stood, through my infancy, childhood, youth  and manhood, up to the present time, so much   so that it has seemed as though some invisible  power or fate was watching my foot steps in  order to find some opportunity to take my life  from the earth. I can only attribute the con-  tinuation of my life to the present time to a   merciful God, whose hand has been stretched  out and rescued me from death in the midst of  the many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I   have passed through; some of which I will   here mention.      When three years of age, I fell into a cal-  dron of boiling water, was instantly caught   out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine   months before I was considered out of dan-  ger.      At five years of age, I fell from the great   beam of a barn, striking my face upon the   floor, which came near breaking my neck.      Three months afterwards, I broke one of my  arms, by falling down stairs. I soon after  broke my other arm by falling out of a high  stoop, upon a pile of timber.      When six years of age, I came near being  killed by a surly bull. My father and I were  feeding pumpkins to the cattle; a surly bull   drove my cow away from the one she was  eating. I took the pumpkin he had left, upon  which he pitched at me. My father told me   to throw down the pumpkin and run. I ran   down a steep hill, and took the pumpkin with  me, being determined that the cow should have  her rights. The bull pursued; as he was  about to overtake me, I stepped into a post  hole and fell; the bull leaped over me, after   the pumpkin, and tore it to pieces with his   horns, and would have served me in the same   way, had I not fallen.      During the same year I went into my father's  saw mill, with several others; I got upon the  head-block to take a ride while the carriage   was running back, not anticipating any dan-  ger; my leg was caught between the head-  block and the fender-post, and broke both   bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken   to the house, and lay nine hours before my  bones were set, suffering severe pain; but being  young, my bones soon knit together and I was   upon my feet again; during my confinement by   this lameness, my bro. Thompson was also  confined in the same room with the typhus   fever.      When seven years of age, I was riding on  the top of a load of hay, which my uncle, Oz-  en Woodruff, was driving to the barn; he turn-  ed the load over upon me; I was nearly suffo-  cated for the want of air, before the hay was  removed.      At eight years old, I was riding in a one  horse wagon with several others; the horse  took fright, ran down a steep hill, and turned   the wagon over upon us; but again while in   the midst of danger, my life was preserved:  none of us were seriously injured.      When nine years old, I climbed into an elm  tree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a dry  limb, which broke, and I fell about fifteen feet  upon my back, which beat the breath out of   my body. A cousin ran and told my parents I  was dead; before they arrived at the spot, I  came to my senses, and met them.      When twelve years of age, I was drowned  in Farmington river, and sunk in 30 ft. of  water, and after carrying one person to the   bottom with me, I was miraculously saved   by a young man, named Bacon, diving to the    [Column 2]  bottom, and carrying with him a large stone  to hold him down until he obtained my body,  not expecting to save me alive: I suffered much   in being restored to life.      At thirteen years of age, while passing   through Farmington meadows, in the depth of   winter, the roads were drifted with snow; and   in an exceedingly blustering day, I became so   chilled and overcome with cold that I could   not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a   large apple tree. A man in the distance, see-  ing me go in, hastened to my rescue, realizing   my danger more fully than I did: when he ar-  rived at the spot, I had fallen asleep, and was   nearly insensible; he had much difficulty in   arousing me to a sense of my situation. He   procured means to carry me to my father's   house, and through a kind providence, my life   was again preserved.      At fourteen years of age, I split my left   instep open with an ax, which went nearly   through my foot: it was nine months getting   well.      At fifteen years of age, I was bitten in my   left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of   hydrophobia; he dented my hand with his   teeth, but did not draw blood, and I was again   preserved, through the mercies of God, from   an awful death.      At the age of seventeen, I was riding a very   ill-tempered horse that I was not acquainted   with; and while going down a very steep   rocky hill, the horse taking advantage of the   ground, suddenly leaped from the road, and   ran down the steep, amid the rocks, at full   speed, and commenced kicking up, and at-  tempted to throw me over his head upon the   rocks; but I lodged upon the top of his head,   grasped hold of each ear as with a death grip,   expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces   against the rocks. While in this position,   sitting astride of his neck, with no bridle to   guide him but his ears, he plunged down the   hill under full speed, until he ran against a   rock and was dashed to the ground. I went   over both his head and the rock, about one rod,   and struck the ground square on my feet, being   the only thing visible that saved my life; for  had I struck upon any other part of my body,   it must have killed me instantly; as it was, my   bones crushed from under me, as though they   were reeds. It broke my left leg in two places,   and put out both my ankles in a shocking   manner, and the horse came near rolling over   me in his struggles to get up. My uncle,   Titus Woodruff, saw me fall, got assistance  and carried me to his house. I lay from 2 p.m.   till 10, without medical aid; then my father   arrived, bringing Dr. Swift, of Farmington, with   him, who set my bones, boxed up my limbs,   and carried me in his carriage eight miles   that night, to my father's. My sufferings   were very great; I had good attention, how-  ever, and in eight weeks I was out doors upon   my crutches.      In 1827, while attempting to clear the ice   out of a water-wheel, standing upon the wheel   with one arm around the shaft, a man hoisted   the gate, and let a full head of water upon it;   as soon as the water struck the wheel, it   started; my feet slipped into the wheel, but I   immediately plunged head foremost over the   rim into about three feet of water, and my   weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I   should have been drawn under a shaft and   crushed to death.      In 1831, while having charge of the flouring   mill in Collinsville, Connecticut, I was stand-  ing inside of a breast wheel, 20 feet in dia-  meter, upon one of the arms near the top,   clearing out the ice, when a full head of water   was let on to it. The wheel immediately   started; but I dropped my ax and leaped   through it to the bottom, by the shaft and   arms about twenty feet; as I struck the bot-  tom of the wheel, I was rolled out against a   ragged stone wall with only about two feet   clearance between it and the wheel; the   wheel caught me and rolled me out into the   water below, where I found myself without   any bones broken, but with some bruises and   much fright.      [Column 3]  During the winter of 1831, while in New   Hartford, Ct., I passed through a severe course   of lung fever.      In 1833, the day I was baptized, one of my   horses, newly sharp shod, kicked my hat off   my head, and had he struck two inches lower  would probably have killed me instantly; in  ten minutes afterwards, while driving the   same team down a hill on a sleigh without   any box, the bottom boards slipped forward   under the roller and caught the ground, turned   endwise, and fell on the horses' backs, throw-  ing me between the horses; they ran to the   bottom of the hill, dragging me with the lines,   head foremost, with the sleigh on top of me,   about twenty rods over a smooth snow path:   I escaped unharmed, however, in the midst of   both dangers.      In 1834, while traveling in Zion's Camp in   Missouri, a rifle was accidentally discharged,   and the ball passed through three tents, with   about twelve men in each, and lodged in a   wagon axle-tree, while a man was standing   behind it, and injured no one; it passed within   a few inches of my breast, and many others   escaped as narrowly as myself.      A few months afterwards, a musket, heavily   loaded with buckshot, was accidentally snap-  ped within a few feet of me, with the muzzle   pointed at my breast; it had a good flint and   was well primed, but it missed fire, and my   life was again preserved.      In April, 1839, in Rochester, Illinois, I was   riding upon the running gears of a wagon with-  out a box, sitting upon the forward axletree,   when the bolt, fastening the coupling pole,   came out, which left the hind wheels; and my   weight on the forward bolster and tongue,   turned the coupling pole over on to the   horses, turning the stakes upside down, and   shut me up fast between the bolster and tongue,   but in such a manner that my head and   shoulders dragged on the ground; my horses   took fright, and ran out into an open prairie  and dragged me in this position for about half   a mile. I managed to guide them with my   left hand, so as to run them into a corner of a   high worm fence, where we landed in a pile   together. I was considerably bruised, but es-  caped without any broken bones.      July 23, 1842—Prest. Joseph Smith, sent me   from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a stock of   paper. I went down upon a steamboat; was   six days on the way, during which time I was   severely attacked with bilious fever. The day   I made my purchase the fever was so high I   was scarcely sensible of what I was doing.   As soon as I made my purchase and got my   freight on board, I took my berth and lay there   until I arrived at Nauvoo on the 10th of Aug.   I was confined to my bed forty days, and pass-  ed through the most severe fit of sickness I   ever endured; my life was despaired of by   many of my friends. I was administered to   by Prest. Smith and the Twelve: my life was   preserved by the power of God. I took a re-  lapse twice after I began to recover; once   while in council with the Presidency and   Twelve; my strength left me, my breath stop-  ped, and I felt as though I was struck with   death.      Sept. 12, 1843—At five o'clock p.m., I left   Boston on the express train for Portland.   While passing through Chesterwoods, six   miles south of Kennebunk, after dark, and   while going at full speed, we struck one of   the rails which some persons had raised by   rolling a log under it, and landed in a pile;   three cars were filled with passengers, and   their lives were saved by having a long train   of freight between the passenger cars and the   engine; all of them were mashed to pieces; the   engineer was killed, some of the passengers   had bones broken; I escaped unhurt.      On the 5th of Oct., 1846, while with the   camp of Israel building up Winter Quarters,   on the west side of the Missouri river, (then   Indian country) I passed through one of the   most painful and serious misfortunes of my   life. I took my axe and went two and a half   miles on to the bluffs to cut some shingle tim-  ber to cover my cabin; I was accompanied by    [Column 4]  two men. While the third tree was falling,   which was an oak, over two feet in diameter,   I stepped behind it some ten feet, and also to   one side the same distance, where I thought I   would be entirely out of danger; but when the   tree fell, there being a crook in the body of it,   which struck a knoll on the ground, the whole   body shot endwise back of the stump and   bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on   the breast and knocked me several feet into   the air against a standing oak, and the falling   tree followed me in its bound and caught me   against the standing tree, and I came down   between them; before reaching the earth, how-  ever, I was liberated from them, and struck   the ground upon my feet in a badly bruised con-  dition. My left thigh, the whole length of it,   and my hip and left arm were much bruised;   my breast bone and three ribs on my left side   were broken; my lungs, vitals and left side   were also bruised in a shocking manner. After   the accident I sat upon a log until Mr.   John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get   my horse. Notwithstanding I was so badly   hurt, I mounted my horse, and rode two and a   half miles over a very rough road, dismount-  ing twice in consequence of miry places; my   breast and vitals were so badly torn to pieces,   that at each step of the horse the pain went   through me like an arrow. I continued on   horseback until I arrived at Turkey creek, on   the north side of Winter Quarters. I then be-  came exhausted, and was taken off my horse   and carried to my wagon in a chair. I was   met in the street by Prests. Brigham Young,   H. C. Kimball and W. Richards and others,   who assisted in carrying me to my family.   Before laying me upon my bed, the Presidency   laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering and   distress in the name of the Lord, and said I   should live and not die. I was then laid upon   my bed in my wagon, and as the Apostles pro-  phesied upon my head, so it came to pass. I   employed no physician on this occasion, but   was administered to by the Elders of Israel   and nursed by my wife. I lay upon my bed   unable to move until my breast bone began to   knit together, which commenced on the ninth   day. I began to walk about in twenty days;   in thirty days from the time I was hurt I again   commenced to do hard labor.      July 5, 1848—While on a mission to the   Eastern States, I drove my carriage, contain-  ing myself and family into the door yard of   br. James Williams in Iowa, to camp for the   night. I tied my mules to a large oak tree   several rods from the carriage. As we were   about to lay down in the carriage for the night,   I was strongly impressed to go and move my   mules from the oak tree, and also to move my   carriage. I followed the dictates of the Spirit,   and removed my mules to a small hickory   grove, also moved my carriage several rods,   and retired to rest.       In a short time a heavy rain storm came on,   which broke the tree near the ground, and   laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood.   As it was, the top struck the hind end of the   carriage; the tree was two feet in diameter.   Thus, by obeying the whisperings of the Spirit,   myself and family were preserved.      On the 21st day of April, 1856, while assist-  ing to remove an ox that had died from poison   and had been skinned, I inoculated my arm   with poison, and mortification ensued. The   poison worked through my system for seven   days before it showed itself outwardly. On   the 28th my arm began to swell, was in great   pain and showed signs of mortification. I   showed it to Prest. Young, who advised me to   cleanse my stomach immediately, and put on   onion poultices, and anything that would draw   the poison from my system into my arm, which   counsel I immediately put in execution. The   29th was another trying day to my life; the   poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole   system, that my strength left me; I could not   stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and   stomach ceased to act, my speech was like   that of a drunken man. Prest. Young called,   in company with Dr. Sprague, and laid hands   upon me, and rebuked the disease and the     
 power of the destroyer which had seized my  body, and promised me in the name of the  Lord, that I should not die but live to finish  my work which was appointed me upon the  earth. I soon began to recover. The poison  and mortification left my system and centered  in my arm, and was drawn from my arm thro'   the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened with   a strong decoction of wormwood, ragweed and   wild sage; the dead flesh was removed from   my arm with instruments and lunar caustic,  and in a few days I was well again.      I have occupied considerable space in refer-  ring to those peculiar circumstances which   have attended me during life, and to sum the   matter up it stand thus:—I have broken both   legs—one in two places—both arms, my breast  bone and three ribs, and had both ankles dis-  located. I have been drowned, frozen, scalded,   and bit by a mad dog—have been in water   wheels under full head of water—-have passed   through several severe fits of sickness, and   encountered poison in its worst forms—have   landed in a pile of railroad ruins—have barely   been missed by the passing bullet, and have   passed through a score of other hair-breadth  escapes.      It has appeared miraculous to me, that with  all the injuries and broken bones which I have  had, I have not a lame limb, but have been   enabled to endure the hardest labor, exposures  and journeys—have often walked forty, fifty,   and on one occasion, sixty miles in a day. The   protection and mercy of God has been over   me, and my life thus far has been preserved;   for which blessings I feel to render the grati-  tude of my heart to my Heavenly Father, pray-  ing that the remainder of my days may be   spent in His service and in the building up of   His kingdom.

Eldridge Blessed 24 Missionaries 20 To England & 4   To the states we ordained 2 Elders & one seventy W Woodruff spoke  to the Missionaries a short time & exhorted them to keep a Journal   of their Ministry every day of their lives He said I would advised   you to get all of your blessings written & preserve them. In writing your   Journal I do not care about your keeping an account of what you eat  or drink or whare you sleep unless you should be in a Desert, in the   wilderness or on a mountain & have nothing to Eat then if the beast of   the field or Fowls or Heaven Come & Feed you as the ravens did Elisha  then I would want you to record that, but I do feel to Enjoin it upon you  to make a record of Evry official act of your life. If you baptize, confirm  ordain or bless any person or administer to the sick write an account of  it if evry man will do this the church can write a correct account of it  we are not apt to think of the importance of Events as they transpire with  us but we feel the importance of them afterwards we are living in one of  the most important Generations that man ever lived on Earth & we should  write an ofaccount of those important transactions which are takeing place before  our Eyes in fulfillmen of the prophesies & the revelation of God there is a great  flood of Revelations fulfillig in our day & as they are transpiring before   our eyes we want a record made of them if the power & blessings of     
 God are made manifest in your preservation from Danger & death  you should make a record of it keep an account of the dealings of   God with you daily I have written all the blessings I have received   & I would not take gold for them. I am in the Historians office & I find   it vary difficult to get or find a record of Events as they past  along shuch as we want to make the History but if the Elders will take  pains to write their Official Acts so the Historian can get hold of  them it will be a benefit to the Church the History of this Church  will remain throught time & In Eternity *      Elder P. P. Pratt followed & backed up my testimony & said he had   reflected upon this subject for years to know what a man should write  & have come to the conclusion that a man should write his   official acts in the priesthood I have been sorry that I have not  kept more of a Journal than I have I wish I had written evry  mans name that I had ever baptized or administered unto it   is neccesary for us to keep a Journal.      * W. Woodruff said if their was no other motive in view ownly to have  the privilege of reading over our Journals & for our children to read it   would pay for the time spent in writing it      I left while Elder Pratt was speaking & went to the Council House &   attended the Agricultural Meeting see mintues of meeting in the D News  of Sept 10th I spent the night at home was poorly in health I  suffer much in the rheumatisms      September 7, 1856 ~ Sunday      7th Sunday I did not Attend meeting. P.P. Pratt spoke in the morn-  ing upon the Priesthood & those who held the priesthood or the keys thereoff  Elders Tripp & Coleborn spoke in the afternoon. Br Trip said said  He called upon Mother Smith & she clasped him in her arms (they were  formerly acquainted) & she said In My son Enoch I am glad to again  see you I am glad to see a man again from Salt Lake she cryed   for Joy, and said she had desired for two years to be with the saints  in the vallies of the Mountains but others had hindered her she alluded  to Emma she says give my love to Brigham & Heber & all the   Faithful Saints for my heart is with them      I attended the prayer Circle in the evening. After prayers President   B Young J M Grant W Woodruff & all in the prayer Circle laid Hands  upon Elder P. P. Pratt Head & blessed him President Young was   Mouth I never heard a better blessing given to man it was not  written at the time but afterwords an outline was written by  Elder pratt & filed in the Historians office Elder T. Bullock was   also blessed J M Grant was Mouth I then      President Young remarked at the closed of the blessing that I am  going to take a mission I will name it here I want to go through this   Territory with H. C. Kimball & J. M. Grant & I want the 12 to go (Brother  Parley says Brother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve there is here)  I want to go through among this people & preach the gospel to them If I can  get red of some of the care of my temporal business I do not feel that   I am in the path of my duty to spend so much of my time in attending  to temporal Matters I think more of one soul than I do of all that   I have scraped together I feel that with the assistance of my brethren that  I could make a great wake by going through this Territory & preaching the gospel  to the people. I feel that some men ought never to be called upon to do another  days work but they should spend there time in preaching the gospel they should  have a man to take care of their Families this should be the case with P P Pratt  He should spend his time preaching we should devote our time to the ministry  as far as possible

Young called together the company of Lancers, Ballows brass band,   Accompanied by the Nauvoo Brass band, & President Kimball   Gen Wells Professor Carrington with many other Citizens in   Carriages & went out to escort them into the City they past up   the Emigration Canyon & ove met the Company at the foot of the   Little mountain on the west side of it. Elder Edmond Elsworth Brigham   Youngs son in Law was the captain of the first Company & Daniel   D MCarthur was the captain of the 2nd company. Both Companies conta-  ined 96 Hand Carts 8 waggons and 486 souls it was a   vary effecting meeting Presidents Young & Kimball walked up the mountain   through the company saluted the saints then organized the company   for travelling in to the City one half of the Company of Lancers went   in Front followed By the Presidency & citizens then the Marshal of the   City J. C. Little then the bands of music then Capt Edmund Elsworth  with his Hand Cart company then Daniel D MCarthur with his   hand Cart Company & the remainder of the Lancers brought up the rear   in this way they started for the City capt Leonard Hardy took Bishop   Hunter & myself into a Buggy & we met the company as they came into  the City edge of the City & we fell into the ranks behind the presidency   ithe people of the City gathered on each side of the road & the streets were     
 & it was an Effecting sight to see such a strange sight about 500 people   enter the City of the Great Salt who had traveled on foot 1500 miles   having drawn there hand carts all the way women Children & old men   had drawn their bedding, clothing & food, the whole distance & this company   of poor people from England had travelled this whole distance in   9 weeks they were covered with dust & some worn down but   cheerful they had beat any horse or ox team during the time they   past up on South Temple Street by President Youngs House the   Deseret Store by W Woodruffs, down to the grove then down to   the public square, there formed in two lines & Camped for   the night. No tongue can tel, No pen can write, the sensation it   created in the reflecting mind to behold the scene, as soon as they  were camped President Young stood up in his carriage & called   upon the bishops & multitude who had gathered to see the Hand   Cart Company to bring them provision & feed them to night   to morrow mornind & noon & night again, & while they stop here   "I wish you all to tarry here untill you are dismissed & I bless you   all in doing good & keeping the commandments of God["] we then   returned to our homes & the bishops & people brought them all   the provisions that were neccessary. Edmund Elsworth saluted   his wives & children as He past his house but did not stop for   any thing untill his Company was camped He lead the Hand Cart   Company by drawing the front Hand Cart with 3 others it reflected   more honour upon him than if he had been mounted upon a   fine horse decked with gold & silver the sisters danced to the music   as they drew the hand carts & wa[l]ked through the streets      September 27, 1856 ~ Saturday      27th [FIGURE] I called upon President Young in the morning. President   Young sat & herd the minutes read of his sermons also Brother   J. M. Grant & corrected them. President Young said it was thought   a wonderful [thing] for this Company to walk so far but take many women   that spin as some do & their steps counted & they would travel 30   miles in a day my children in ther play some times would   run enough to make 10 or 15 miles in a day. wells Little & L. W. Hardy   President Young said He thought the Hand cart company had a   Better time than the teams had "they have not had as hard   a time as we had in going to Moissouri in 1833 [1834] then I went   to Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to Kirtland   within three months over 3000 miles & walked all the way & lay on   the ground evry night. But if I had to fit out a company I   would have fitted out the carts different from what they   were soon came in Lewis Robinson & ward from Green   river. President Young said that washakeek the Indian chief   had cut up smoothest bad trick that I ever heard of so Brother   Robinson related the circumstances as follows Washakeek with   several other Indians came in to his store & ordered him to give them   some spirits. He told them He had none to sell they undertook to get   it by force & robinson pulled them out of the store. He went away   & soon came back with 100 Indians & pulled Robinson up to the   door & told him he must open the door & give him some liquor   so they forced him to open the door & deal out Liquor to them the   100 Indians drank 20 gallons & all got drunk but behaved vary  well they offered to pay for the Liquor. He has been used to   such sprees Brother Robinson said that if he was to do the same   over again He should present a pistol to him & try his luck at it     
 Elder Elsworth came in President Kimball came to him & told him to  pick him out a family to go & stop with him through the winter wanted   a handy man. He said I have not a handy man in my company   but I will pick you out as good one as I can. Mr Dones came in   & gave president Young some Notes against Capt James Brown   of some $3000. Had paid some $1400 in county orders asked president  Young what He should do he would sell the whole for $1200 dollars   President Young told him that He was able & as the Lord had made him   Able the Law should make him willing he said that He was willing the   debt should be collected but did not wish to collect it himself He   said he had trusted him upon the credit of H. S. Eldridge. "It makes   me righteously angry to see Elders go out on a mission & come home   Merchants get trusted for goods & not pay for them.["]      Presidents Young Kimball & Carrington Elsworth & myself rode   down to the square to visit the Hand Cart Company they generally   looked well & cheerful they shook our hands warmly they had   a great quantity of provisions in Camp brought in by the people   I laid hands upon one brother who was taken sick last night   President Young said the people might have their hand carts   after going through the Encampment & Elder Kimball got the   family that He spoke for we rode back to the stray pen to look   at the cattle & mules which the company had brought in Elder   Elsworth pointed out a Mule which he rode after a Buffalo   which He had wounded the Mule took right after the buffalo   & the Mad wounded Buffaloo turned & took after the Mule &   they met almost together but the Mule turned & run back so  suddenly that He flung Elsworth to the ground the Buffalo   plunged at him & Elsworth punched the animal with the   muzzle of the rifle into the Eye so hard a blow that the   Buffalo fell to his knees but rose up & run the other   way it broak his rifle his Mule run 5 miles to Camp   which left Elsworth to walk in      Brother George W Bean came in from Los vegas & reported   that Jons was getting on well with his lead      September 28, 1856 ~ Sunday      28th Sunday I attended the meeting. President Young preached in the   morning followed By Elder Edmund Elsworth & Daniel D Mcarthur   in the Afternoon. Elder Oakley Truman Leonard & President   H. C. Kimball I never heard as strong & powerful sermons ever   delivered by the presidency of this Church as I have heard it   from them of Late. I attended the prayer meeting in the Evening president  B. Young went to Feremore Little's in the Cottonwood Canyon & spent   the night. President Kimball said I have told the people to day of far   greater things than drawing hand Carts to Zion Joseph Smith took   President Brigham Young & myself to the vary spot In adam Ondi  Aman whare Adam offered up his first sacrafize on a spot now   called Hogback.      D. H. Wells said I had a dream last night & saw   a butchers ^cleaver^ in the Heavens in the East. I tryed to show it to Bishop   Pettigrew & he could not see it I felt that there was a strougle [struggle] near   & a great slaughter, & much nearer than the people are aware of. President   Kimball said it would be better for one half of the people to be cut off than   for the rest to suffer as they had done & to go through what we would have   to. At the close of the Council I walked with H. C. Kimball to Presidents  Youngs Barn it contains 6130 square feet of ground building by   President H C Kimball

Elder Dunbar sung &  the Assembly was dismissed.      I met at Early candle light with the seventies & Elders in  the Tabernacle the House was nearly Full the First seven presidents  were present with Joseph Young presiding. President Joseph  Young occupied the fore part of the meeting in transacting the busi-  ness of the Quorums 70 Quorums were called upon & found to   be mostly full.      President J Young then called for a   subscription for the Seventies he got but Little      President J M Grant then arose & said I feel that there are   some [FIGURE] things that greeve me. President Young was asked if   it would not be well to send the Presidents of the seventies out  He said No they would Preach the people to sleep & then to Hell  Now this shows me that the Presidents of the seventies the first seven  Presidents are asleep and their is sumthing wrong with them. if  this is the case that they would preach the people to sleep & then to   Hell Then this body of Counsellors are guilty of Great sins either of   omission or Commission & I would advise Joseph Young to cut off   his council & drop them & appoint men in his stead who are full of  the Holy Ghost & will act with him & assist him. Now we will take  up his council & look at them. Now here is brother Levi Hancock  why he will fiddle diddle di fiddle diddle do fiddle diddle dum & tweedle   diddle ta. Now he might preach a month & ther would be no more spirit  of God in it than their would be in a Cabbage Leaf. Now If you would   preach the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of some great Henious sins either  of commission or omission you have either committed Adultery or some other  sins & you ought to be droped. Here is Brother Harriman now if you will preach     
 the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of some great sins either of commission   or omission have committed Adultery or some great sins & you ought to be   droped. Brother Harriman might preach a month then you might put it all  in the Eye of a Cambrick Needle & there would be as much room in it as  there would be for a bulfrog in the Atlantic ocean. Albert P Rockwood if   you would preach the people to sleep then to Hell you are asleep dead, & guilty  of committing Adultery or some great sins there is no sap in you you are  as dry as an old musk rat skin & you ought to be droped. And Zerah Pulsipher  if He would preached the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of some  abominable sins of commission or omission of committing Adultery or some  great sins & ought to be droped & I will say the same of Benjamin Clapp  & H. S. Edldridge according to the presidents words they are asleep & ought  to be droped.  I think that Brother Joseph ought to Cut them off & prune   the trees around him how can the body be kept awake & Healthy when  the head is asleep & dead. It has been with great reluctance that I have  voted for the presidents of the seventies for a long time And I will say   to these seventies if your Presidents have gone to sleep dont you go to  sleep. but keep awake. If your Presidency have committed Adultery   & done wrong & committed great sins that will damn them dont you  do it but wake up. Is there any man that ins in that council that  has been ordained a councellor to Joseph Young if so I do not   know it but each man was ordained a president & is under as   much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling & do his   duty but they never think of such a thing of taking any burthen  upon their shoulders but leave it all for Joseph Young to do & he has to  drag them along when I vote for Rockwood, Pulsipher, Harriman &  Levi Hancock I do it vary reluctantly, & I have done so for years &  now I want to have you to wake up & do yor duty. There is no life  spirit sap or Juce in Hancok, Harriman pulsipher, & Rockwood's preaching,  to more than there is in an old mummy. These are the kind of men  that are your presidents. And the seventies as a body are as dry & dead   as an old chip & you are as tight as the bark of a tree. It is the duty   of the seventies to sustain Brother Joseph Young to furnish him with   food fuel & rament that He may give himself to the work of the min-  istry who has esstablished the president to take men who were  in the battalion to be presidents I would take men who were full of   the Holy Ghost I do not care whare the Hell they come from. This  is what I want I say again the Presidents of the seventies are asleep   and if they do not wake up they should be cut off. He spoke in the power   of God & the gift of the Holy Ghost      Levi Hancok followed him & said He had not commit Adultery he never  courted any woman but his wife & she courted him. He justified himself   in a measure. He was followed by Benjamin Clap who said He had  not committed adultery & if he hag [had] gone to sleep he had done it since   he came here for he was not asleep when he came home. He intended   to serve God with all his heart & was willing to go through this territory  with his pack upon his back & preach the gospel. A. P. Rockwood received  the chastizement & ment to repent & go into the waters of Baptism as  soon as He got a chance      J. M. Grant asked me if I had not sumthing to say that the seventies   were under the Twelve. I told him I would like to bear testimony to  what He had said. I Arose & said to the people that I wished them  not to trifle with the teachings of President Grant for what He had  said was true he had shot arrows of the Almighty among the people   and if they did not wake up & take the warning & repent of there     
 sins for the day has come when it will not do to trifle with the Things of   God nor with his servants who hold the keys of the kingdom & are called to  lead us I called upon the Presidents of the seventies & all the seventies  to begin this hour to call upon God for the Holy spirit & advised them   to stop work & give themselves to prayer untill they could get the spirit  of God I had the spirit of God in speaking unto the people I told them  I had recorded what Elder Grant had said & I should keep it on  record.      I was followed by Joseph Young who spoke well & in a good spirit      October 8, 1856 ~ Wednesday      ^[FIGURE]^ 8th I spent most of the day in the office President Young called upon   me in the evening & spent about half an hour with me. It was a vary   cold windy rainy day considerable snow fell upon the mountains  I spent the evening at home I wrote a Letter to Brother James Bosnell      October 9, 1856 ~ Thursday      9th I called upon President Young at his office found also H C Kimball  J M Grant D ^H^ Wells A. Carrington N. V. Jones & others I herd a  difficulty between N. V. Jones & Bringhurst stadted before the   presidency which resulted in sustaining Elder Jones & Cutting off  Elder Bringhurst or disfel[low]shiping him. President Young had sent   Elder Jones to make led & Elder Bringhurst had not sustained him but  opposed him. F D Richards & company called upon the President   to settle all their matters as Agents for the Church abroad      Presidents Kimball & J. M. Grant spent the remainder of the  day in the House of the Lord. I spent most of the day in the office      Some remark were made last sunday night relative to the family  of Joseph Smith President Young said I have no fears with   regard to the Children of Joseph God will take care of them   & all will be right      Remarks by W W. we have passed through another Conference &  such an won I never saw before. The spirit of God is like a  flame among the Leaders of this people & they are throwing the  arrows of the Almighty among the people. J. M. Grant is   pruning with a sharp two edged sword & calling loudly upon  the people to wake up & repent of their sins. The Elders who have returned  are full of the Holy Ghost & power of God the account which they give   of their missions & the dealings of God with them have been vary   interesting & edifying unto the people      I attended meeting in the 14th ward this evening. I addressed the people  was followed by Bishop Hoagland who spoke well he reproved Brother   Ballantyne for the saying the Head or Bishop of the ward was out of the  way & while the Head was wrong the body would be wrong. The Bishop said He  had done the best he could & He did not feel to take the reprof      Brother Balantyne arose & made his confession before the people which was   except.      W. Woodruff remarked that the people should learn a lesson  by that Circumstance that no man in the Church has a right to reprove   any man that is over him in the priesthood if he sees that he is really doing   wrong He has a right to go to the man & pray him to desist but He has   no wright to speak of it to any one ownly to report it to those who are   over him that the evil may be corrected by proper authority      samuel Richards followed & spoke upon the same subject, much to  Edification. He was followed by Gilbert Clements who spoke lengthy     
 Bishop Hoagland spoke a short time & closed the meeting      The Bishops of this City were baptized to day & confirmed      October 10, 1856 ~ Friday      10th I called upon A Carrington found him unwell I called   upon President Young & asked him to hear History read.

I attended meeting in the 14th ward  Wm Taylor spoke to the people rather Cold & dry.  Followed by Brother   Horn who spoke good sentiment not vary spirited. I followed him  spoke of the various sins which we were liable to commit among others  fals promises in deal spoke of the great Blessings which God had   given us from the begining through his servants had revealed great  & mighty principles unto us through the prophets who lead us for which  we ought to be thankful & live our religion I had a measure of   the spirit of the Lord but not as much as I would have liked  I was followed by Bishop Hoagland who had a good deal of the  spirit of the Lord. He reproved his councellors & said they were asleep  & did him no good if he got any thing out of them He had to go after  them they should come to him He said the people were not sufficently   awake he wanted them to wake up & get more of the spirit of God  He spoke well      October 11, 1856 ~ Saturday      11th I spent the day in the office making a commencement upon the History  of Brigham Young.

Bullock red Church History to him I am about  getting inniciated into my office as assistant Historian      while reading the revelation upon the patriarchal marriage &  while reading that paragraph relating to sthe sheding of inno-  cent Blood President Young remarked that that was a vary  nisce point to distinguish between innocent Blood & that which   is not innocent. were we now commanded to go & avenge the  Blood of the prophets whare it wood ^reach^ infants from the cradle to  the third & forth generation would they know what to do in such   a case they would not. But their is one thing that is a consolation   to me And that is I am satisfied that the Lord will not require it  of this people untill they become sanctifyed & are led by the spirit of   God so as not to shed inocent Blood. Again what does the saying  mean that sayes all shall be damned that does not keep this Law   unto whom it is revealed does it mean that they shall take more wives  than one. I think it includes the whole law with its covenants. I think   that many that come into this world will be damned or disorgan-  ized. And I think this is the Death that is refered to that the Broad  road leads to, while few will enter throug the straight gate into the   fulness of Eternal life for their are many who will not keep the law  of life [FIGURE] President Young Had Brother Cannon take a Daguerreotype  likeness of the temple draft for Truman O Angel to take  with him to England.

I have faced Accident, misfortune, & apparently death so many  times & in so many shapes & forms from my childhood through   life thus far that it has become a proverb with me to say that   there has seemed to be two powers constantly watching me & at work   with me one to kill & the other to save me thus far the power to save me  & preserve my life has prevailed. How long I shall be blessed with this  preserving power & care time must determin. I have never untill now     
 been called upon to war with poison & mortification in my system  untill now, but I am satisfyed to day that I have this enemy to mee[t]  & that to in its worst form their is but a small chance for a man to   live that is innoculated with poison & mortification by dissecting   the body of either man or beast it is much worse than drinking poison  or being bit by poisonous serpents for it is in a much more deadly  form. several have died this spring by skining cattle who have died  all should be more cautious than what I have been in this matter   & not run the risk of looseing their lives by trying to save the skins of  Animals who die with disease, the following Account will show   the operation of this disease with me from day to day & how near  I came of loosing my life in fact I was ownly saved through the power  & mercy of God. This morning the affected spot upon my wrist had   grown about the size of a dime had risen above the arm & main [flesh]   about half an inch & turned black as ink my arm began to swell  & pain me & I felt its workings through my system I called upon  President Young & showed him Arm and asked his advice He   counciled me to go to immediately & clense my stomach & bowels  & poultice my Arm with onions, Earth, or any thing that would  draw it from my system. He also advised me to show it to   Dr Sprague. I did so & he in addition to what President Young  had recommended dug me up soom sum dock Elecompance &   Blazing star roots & advised me to make a tea of it & drink   it also to make a poultice of it & put it on my Arm I went  immediately home & began to put these things into execution   for I saw that I had a strong warfare in order to save my life      April 29, 1856 ~ Tuesday      29th  [FIGURES] Tuesday this was a trying day to my life the poison  had so circulated through my system that it was affecting   my whole body seriously I became so weak I could not stand upon  my feet it took two persons to lead me from the fire to my bed  I could not talk no more than if I had been drunk. my stomach  & bowels sceased to Act And to Judge from outward appearances it   seemed as though I should not live 24 hours my wife & friends labored  with me through the day faithfully & with Emetics & injections  & with raw onion poltices upon my arm I got my whole system  in operation before night. President Brigham Young called  upon me in company with Dr Sprague at about evening I   was some better than I had been through the day Brothers   Young & Sprague laid hand upon me & blessed me the  following is a synopsis of the blessing which He pronounced   upon my head which I wrote from memory After my recovery      Brother Wilford in the name of Jesus Christ & by virtue of the Holy priesthood  I lay my hands upon your head to Bless you And I ask my Father  in heaven to stay the deisease which is resting upon you & to cleanse your   Blood & to heal you up & I say in the name of Jesus Christ that  you shall not die but shall live to finish your work which is  appointed you to do upon the Earth, the Adversary has sought many   times to destroy your life from the Earth but the Lord has preserved  you & will preserve you untill your work is done I feel to say that all is  right here I fell to ask the Lord to bless all the means you make use of for  your recovery. You shall be healed up from this deisease & live to  enjoy the society of your family & your children shall grow  up around you & you shall be a blessing to them let your heart  be comforted all shall be well with you And I seal these Blessings   upon you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen     
 April 30, 1856 ~ Wednesday      30th I spent a sick day. I polticed my Arm through the day it continued to   swell to a great extent & as the poison was drawn into it from my   system it continued to inflame & mortify & it looked as though my  whole body would soon be mortified I continued to poltice my arm   with raw onions Earth & pounded roots which continued to draw   all the impurities iof my body into my Arm the poison that was  drawn out of my arm would blister my flesh like a hot iron when-  ever it touched it the flesh turned black & dead & I could not  draw the poison & mortification out of my Arm by onion or  Earth poltices. So I pounded up some charcoal fine & mad it  wet with the juice of worm wood rag weed & wild sage & put   it onto my Arm as a poltice & it began to take the mortification   poison & swelling out of it I was vary sick & having a hard warfare   between life & death but president Young promised me that I should   live And I act in faith upon that promise in all that I do I feel that  I shall live & not die.

He said the   Devels were cast out of heaven to this earth & they are still around   us their condemnation is that they can never have a taberna-  cle but they seek to get into the tabernacle of all men they can   all good & bad when they die remain here upon Earth the same   as the living they are mixed up the same as the living are in a great   measure. Joseph & Hiram & all the faithful Elders in a great measure   are at work to preache the gospel to the spirits in prision & prepare   them for the coming of Christ the wicked spirits will gather  together against Joseph there the same as here but neither the Devil   nor the wicked have any power over him there but he can dispens   them at his will but those who have shed innocent blood or   consented thereto will be angels to the Devil untill they are dis-  organized with the Devil, our children & friends are all with   us or near us many interesting thing were said we are now in   eternity as much as we ever will be      I attended the prayer meeting in the evening herd 5 letters read   from Lyman Wight to Father Porter the subject of the day was  spoken of by President Young.

 a thief, a liar, a Blasphemer or a Parent in all Israel that does   not bow down morning & evening with his family & call upon the  name of the Lord. Let us seek to lay aside our sins & call upon  the Lord untill we do enjoy the Holy spirit continually. evry ma[n]  & woman in all Israel may know what law they are ceeping [keeping] &  to what Glory they are bound. But all persons may know that they   will miss of a full salvation while they are committing sin of any   kind now let not the people think [it] strange because the Presidency  of this Church chastise them it is their duty & place to do ^it^ when  it is necessary. let us fully realize that we should not go to  sleep & be careless & indiferent towards the events which we  are called to pass through we should overcome the world the flesh  & the Devil, & trust in God for evry blessing their is neither  Male nor female that finally overcome & receive a Celestial   Glory no matter how great the sacrifice may be in order to obtain  it but what will be satisfyed with the reward & would not   wish to obtain it ^on^ any easier term      December 31, 1855 ~ Monday      31st Dec This is the Last day of 1855 we spent the day in   the Legislative Assembly. Thus time rapidly flies with us  evry year grows big with Events both with Mount Zion & great   Babylon. while the past year has been an Eventful one  In taking the gospel in a measure from the gentiles & carriying it to  the Jews even the Lamanites who are begining to come to understanding  & while Zion is spreading herself & enlarging her borders  in strength. Great Babylon is visited at the same time   with wars & Bloodsheds pestilence & famine which is   ownly a fore runner of what is to come to pass      what the future Year will bring to pass, time must deter  mine, but it will lay many low in death. Judgments  will continue to increase upon the gentile Nations & great   calamity awate the wicked. May the Lord Preserve me from   evil sin & transgression may he enable me to keep the word  of wisdom & be preserved in life & health with my wives  & children      [several lines blank]  I looked over my Journal & found the following synop-  sis as recorded on the following Page to be my labours during   the past year

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S   JOURNAL   FOR   1856     
 January 1, 1856 ~ Tuesday      JAN. 1st, 1856 ^Tuesday^ I spent the day at home writing      January 2, 1856 ~ Wednesday      2nd I spent the day in Joint session. All the officers of the   Territory were Elected the Judges, & Notary Public of the co[u]nties   The commissioners, Treasurers, Auditors, Marshalls, surveyors &  Attorney Generals, The Chancellors & Regency of the University   of Deserett. I was appointed as one of the Regency.      January 3, 1856 ~ Thursday      3rd I spent the day In the council I attended meeting in the  evening. Elder J. C. Wright Preached was followed by J. C. Little  & E. T Benson. J. C. Wright spoke upon honesty, paying Debts,  making no dishonest contracts, his teaching was good Elder   Little backed up Brother Wrights testimony & exhorted the people to  go to & build up the place as the presidency had directed. E. T Benson   spoke of men proving themselves true in this Church & kingdom   & then they would be blessed, to trust in God for their reward      January 4, 1856 ~ Friday      4th I spent the day in Joint session      January 5, 1856 ~ Saturday      5th I spent the day in council. The Judges Secretary Babbitt   [FIGURE] Marshall Haywood, capt Hardy with all the attendant   train came in this evening their was a mistery hanging   over the company which is almost unexplainable part of the company  were prisioners among whom was babbitt he wore chains a  part of the way about half in Earnest & half in Jest. I received   14 Letters from My Family 3 from Mrs Woodruff 2 from   Phebe & Susan 1 From Willford, Bulah, Moroni Sarah & 2  from Emma. I was truly glad to hear from home      January 6, 1856 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday I wrote 8 Letters to day to my family in answer  [FIGURE] to theirs. I did not attend meeting through the day  President Young spoke to the people in the forenoon upon  the subject of mens Judging each other. He said He reproved  men for their acts but He was not prepared to cast men  down to Hell for their imperfections & acts untill he knew the  hearts of men & principles by which they were governed  He also said that a person always had to experience the oppositi[on]  & pass through sorrow pain & affliction before he could be  exhalted to glory & if a man had the exact glory that   Jesus had he would have to die in the same way & if a  man passed through this world without passing through  the dregs of poverty he would have to pass through it hereafter  before he could be exhalted to Eternal riches in their fulness  their is no other way for men to get an exhaltation but  to follow their file Leader. The Twelve have no right  to ask the Presidency why they do this or that or why they  tell the Twelve to do this or that ownly go & do as they are   told & this same principle should go through evry quorum   in the church & kingdom of God on Earth & ^when^ this rule is observed  then the kingdom will be ours.      He reproved the people for selling their land warrants said  the wicked would put those vary land warrants upon our   possessions & then there would be a fuss with the Mormons & that   was what the people of the world      [rest of page blank]

He was followed   by J. C. Wright. He bore testimony that the Lord has been  with this people from the beginning up to this day the gifts &  graces were manifest. He spoke of many of the sick being healed  even the dead had been raised to life. He spoke of the Law of   God a woman was under the Law of her husband & no other if   she obeyed his Law she was under no transgression because   her husband was her head & evry man & woman had a  head the Presidency of the Church is the head of the Church on   Earth & if we obey them we shall be saved. Elder Felshaw   followed & gave an Exertation to the Saints & spoke of the privilege   the saints were now enjoying in fillmore in hearing from   so many of their brethren.      The people Assembled again at candlelight & were addressed by   O. Pratt ^spok^ upon the Law of consecration he made many good  remarks concerning the benefits of the Law of consecration  He was followed J. C. Little who spoke well bore a strong  testimony of the work of God & he was followed by      January 7, 1856 ~ Monday      7th I met in Joint session. A discussion took place  {Some American whores}      January 8, 1856 ~ Tuesday      8th [FIGURE] I Attended court & took minutes of the proceedings  of the trial of Judge Drummond for Murder      January 9, 1856 ~ Wednesday      9th I attended council of the Joint session of the Legislature  In the forenoon & the court in the afternoon on the trial  of Judge Drummond On an accusation of Murder it   was first brought Before the Probate Court then Judge Drumm[ond]  got out a rit of Hebeus Corpus given by Judge Kenny the  case then of the right of writ was tried before Judge Kenny  yesterday. Mr Miner & Mr Kelting plead in behalf   of the prisioner they both took a strong stand against the  Probate Court, against the Legislature & the Laws of Utah  Kelting made a fool of himself it was thought by some  that He was insane and knew not what he said. J. C. Little   T. Williams & Wm Hickman Plead in behalf of the State  & sustained the probate court & Utah Laws to day as   soon as the court opened, Judge Drummond informed   the court that He wished to withdraw the whole suit from   before him the Judge informed him that He would have to be  remanded back to the probate court. He said He knew that  but He wished to withdraw the suit without Malace it was then  withdrawn & the court closed  [rest of page blank

W. Babbitt spoke first. He was followed by Judge  Stiles Porter Rockwell Orson Pratt, Enoch Reese, John S Folman  then Governor Young closed they brought to light many in-  teresting things. W. Woodruff reported all their speeches &   has them in reserves the meeting was adjourned to the Tab-  ernacle In Great Salt Lake City Saturday 26 Jan. 1856      January 10, 1856 ~ Thursday      10th I met in the counsil & spent the fore part of the day. I attended  meeting in the evening And I addressed the people & told them   that we had been with them 5 weeks & the presidency & Twelve  & the Legislatures had preached to them many good things  I exhorted them to give heed to what they had herd I advis-  ed the young men to improve well their time & store their minds  well with knowledge while in the days of their youth that they   might have the benefit of it when they come to do business  in the church & kingdom of God. spoke of the responsibility  which was resting upon parents. the work of the kingdom  of God would continue to increase as fast as its numbers increased      Brother Enoch Reese followed & bore testimony to the  work of God & spoke much to the Edifycation of the people He  was followed by Brother Felshaw, Dobson, & others      January 11, 1856 ~ Friday      11th I spent the day in Joint session on the Melicia & Herd Bills  [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Elias Smith for publication      January 12, 1856 ~ Saturday      12th I met in Joint session in the forenoon & spent the  Afternoon writing I wrote one letter to Father Woodruff  [FIGURES] the Mail came in in the evening & brought me  one letter from Mrs Phebe W. Woodruff which I  was glad to get      January 13, 1856 ~ Sunday      13 Sunday I spent the fore part of the day at home   [FIGURE] writing I wrote 2 letters to Mrs Phebe W. Woodruff   One family letter, the other personal      On the return of the brethren from meeting they informed me   that President Brigham Young had preached one of the greatest  sermons he had ever deliverd on earth the following are the  items Delivered to me of his sermon by Jonathan C Wright   ^but mostly from Thomas Bullocks report which was copied from his report^      [FIGURES] He Arose & said By our acts   we have said to the world we are   Christs and we have exhibited it more than any other (of the   Christian world). Evry thread & tie that binds man to man  has been broaken assunder (in consequence of receiveing the fulness   of the Gospel of Christ.) Men have left their wives, wives their  husbands children their parents & parents their children (Brothers   their sisters & sisters their Brothers in order to be gathered with  the saints of God that they might partake of salvation). This people   have proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of   the way of life & salvation. This people have proven (to all men)   that they can sacrafize evry endearment (in this life) for (Eternal)     
 life & salvation & we prove that we bear this principle through  evry difficulty (which we are called to pass through) it is our duty   to make evry sacrafice that is required of us so that our Father   in heaven, the Holy Angels, & all Just men who sit enthroned in  glory power, & dominion may look upon us in this capacity ie that   is that they may see in their Kingdoms that we do prove to them  that we are willing to make evry sacrafize ^if i may call it a sacrifize^ on Earth endearing  to man in order that we may secure a seat with them in   Eternal light & glory. (But not withstanding all the light & knowledge  we have of life & salvation) do you not see how easy it is for us   to turn away to the right & to the left & say & do many things which  we afterwards regret & wish we had not done is it not the case  with us all more or less, it is. I see a thousand weakness in myself  that I ^now^ regret and it is so with all those who have the light of  the spirit of God they can see their weaknesses (& regret them  & they will try to over come them I can not ownly see these things   in myself but I can see them in my brethren for when I learn  myself & Brigham I learn my brethren by this rule I know all  of you) we give way to temptation and angry feelings against   our Brother & want to be revenged on them. I ask is this a  righteous feeling, No it is not, and yet we live day by day &   week byafter week & year after year in this year way, the  People will be guilty of a little lying a little swareing a little deceiving  & a little stealing. do you think that you can repent of all your  sins & be forgiven in a moment. no you cannot, evry latter day   saint knows better, this would be sectarianism, the religion  of the world is that a man may commit Murder & when on the   gallows he can repent & be forgiven & go right straight to Abrah-  ams bosom but this is fals doctrin it is not true. Some say  that I cannot over come my passions when I am tempted &   tried I cannot help giving way to my feelings I must   give vent to them and scold & sometimes Sswear swear and   I cannot help it. But I tell you that you can help it you  have got to help it sometime or other or you cannot be saved you  have got to begin to learn to over come, you should begin to im-  prove day by day. Shun the errors as you see them and improve   upon them be better men & women tomorrow than you are to day  Continue to improve there is not a man or woman here   but what can do better here than they do. But says one   Brother Brigham says hard words. So I do use harsh   words. I am Death & Hell on the wicked, but you never  hear me speak evil of my brethren. But I will reprove  wickedness among the Human family. As your leader I  will say let us try to improve our lives. Let us overcome evrery   temper and evil passion [that] arises within you you can shut  your mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet, and the  next time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep   silence & it will give you a great victory. Mothers when you   are cross & attempt to correct your children conquer your-  selves first. Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions   of your natures arise then you need the grace of God to help  bring yourselves into subjection that you may go in the spirit  of meekness untill you get the victory over your feelings. we   are liable to get out of the way we should not do wrong knowingly     
 for if we say or do things which are wrong we are under obligation  to confess our faults, it would be a hard matter for me to confess  that I had done wrong knowingly. You should be governed by  righteousness. Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren   & sisters like little children. when a person does a wrong  in his foolish weekness look upon it as such. (we see the child[re]n  of man laboring hard to obtain wealth they labour night & day  to obtain this object) but wealth will not give you wisdom, but   if you will shun evil and extend the hand of charity to evry living   being & do good to all (as far as you have an opportunity) this will   grow in you & you will increase (in wisdom & knowledge) we   should live so as to enjoy the spirit of Revelation that we may  know the will of God concerning us in all things. You should   not live for yourselves alone for if your Affections are not   placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not possess charity you will  mis the gate (& not enter into the glory of God yourselves) for you  will not receive the spirit of the gospel, your hearts should be   empted of evry thing but the spirit of the gospel. (that you may be   filled with the spirit of Revelation that you may know the voice  of the good shepherd for if this people was to loose the spirit   of revelation & turn from righteousness they would be liable   to be led down to hell but while the people keep the spirit of  God & of Revelation with them they would know the voice  of the good shepherd.) If I was to get out of the way   would not all that had the spirit of God se[e] it, as they did Sidney   & Strang & Wm Smith, yes they would. When Sidney Rigd-  on claimed to be the shepherd & leader of this people the people  knew not his voice. But when the true shepherd spoke unto   them they knew his voice and they followed him. It is the  duty of this people & their privilege to live in such a manner that   they cannot be deceived by any deceiver. It is your duty to   live your religion. No man can magnify the priesthood & their   calling unless they live their religion, unless they are filled  with the spirit of revelation, of the Holy Ghost, & of the Holy Priesthood  then they can magnify their calling and do their duty to their  Neighbor & to all men then their would be an end to Bishops &  High Councils trials. Parents are under the deepest obligation   to live their religion And the young men & women also that when  you get married your children may be begotten in Holiness &  born in Holy^iness^ Brought forth into the world in Righteousness &  then you cannot make any thing but Saints of them. Begin   your work right Carry it on right. Bring up your children right  then when they are old they will not depart from it.  This is the coven-  ant which God made with Abraham that to his seed there should  be no end. And this promise was made to him when he was childless  He received this covenants from the Lord & desired to see them fulfilled  upon the Earth. Abraham was driven from his Father's house after   he was driven f had received the Priesthood. The Lord Bestowed  his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchisedek  when Abraham received the Presthod the people were so wicked   that no man would receive him but the Lord promised him a  seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should be perpetuated   forever and that to the increase of his seed there should be no end  The Lord promised to Abraham this great blessing A man can   have no greater Blessing than was promised to him that He should     
 have Children who should have the priesthood. I would not   ask the Lord for any greater blessing than this for myself the   Lord Promised him that the various ordinances of his Kingdom   should be administered through his posterity forever where ever  the kingdom of God existed. Then let evry child for the future   be begotten in Holiness and remember this one thing live your religion  I now want to speak of another thing. A vary small portion of   our time was spent in the Temple at Nauvoo whare we began to ad-  minister the ordinances according to the words of Malachi in the 4th ch  5th & 6 verses "Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the   coming of the great & Dreadful day of the Lord." "And He shall turn   the Hearts of the Fathers to the children & the hearts of the children to   their Fathers lest I come & smite the Earth with a curse"  Abram received the promise from the Lord that his seed should   be saved. And all the seed of Abraham in all the Gentile Nations or   among the uncontaminated of the house of Israel will be gathered  That have signned they have changed the Ordinances, & broaken  their covenants, or you would not see the children of these Mountains   in the degredation in which we now find them. The Lamanites upon   this continant are Manassehites almost exclusively, their is but   little of the seed of Ephraim among them, they are counted as   the seed of Abraham and they must be saved or they would   not have become so loathsome as they are, they are punished   in the flesh to make an attonement in the flesh for their   sins & transgressions, and when they pass through the veil the   enemy has no power over them. In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ   all the particles of the Blood of Abraham will be gathered together   The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years   nor never will be again. If an Angel was to commence now  to number them all when he had got the numbers together before   they could be computed there would be a great number more   born during the time of there numerration so they could not be   numbered & this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered  Brethren & sisters you are of the seed of Abraham & you should live   your legio religion that you may claim the promises of Abraham  This priesthood will turn the hearts of the children to the Ancient   Fathers & the children to the Fathers now & those which are to   come will be made perfect this chain must not broaken for   mankind cannot be saved any other way. This Priesthood must   be linked together so that all the children may be linked to Father   Adam. It may be asked when will this work be done, it will be   done in Temples in our day & in the days of our children. we shall   go into the Temples & be pillars therein & go no more out & we shall   plant trees & vineyards & eat the fruit thereof. I will call it the  Millennium. I carry it in my heart I say it has begun      evry saint carries it with him then let us increase in evry   good thing & we will extend this influence from Zion untill   it roots out evry evil & brings iall in subjection to the Kingdom of  our God. We will administer in the Temple which we have now   begun & that is one point gained & we will sealed men   to men by the keys [FIGURE] of the Holy Priesthood this is the   highest ordinance it is the last ordinance of the Kingdom of God   on the earth and above all the endowments that can be   given you it is a finall sealing an Eternal Principle     
 and when once made cannot be broaken by the Devel   when we return to Zion & build the great Temple which Joseph   saw & the centre of Zion is Esstablished the glory of God   will rest upon it by day & by night & those that are prepared   will see the face of the sun of man & they will see Joseph &   Hiram in the flesh in their resurrected bodies. Then will the   armies of Israel be terrible to all Nations then will one chase   a thousand & two put ten thousand to Flight. Who will resurrect   Joseph's Body? It will be Peter, James, John, Moroni, or some one   howho has or will receive the keys [FIGURE] of the resurrection it will proba-  bly be one of those who hold the keys of this dispensation & has   deliverd them to Joseph and you will see Jesus & he will eat peaches   & Apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for   wickedness will increase. Joseph & Jesus will be there they will   walk & talk with them at times & no man mistrusts howho they   are. Joseph will lead the Armies of Israel whether He is seen   or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good Joseph has   got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you & I. After he is   resurrected he will go & Bresurrect Brother Brigham Brother  Heber & Brother Carloss, and when that is done then He will   say now go Brother Brigham & resurrect your wives & children &   gather them together while this is done the wicked will know nothing   of it though they will be in our midst and they will be struck with   fear this is the way the resurrection will be all will not be raised at once   but it will continue in this way untill all the righteous are res-  urrected. After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected body He will   more fully instruct us concerning the Baptism for the dead & the sealing   ordinances. He will say be baptized for this man & that man & that   man be sealed to that man & such a man to such a man, and   connect the Priesthood together. I tell you their will not be   much of this done untill Joseph comes. He is our spiritual Father   Our hearts are already turned to him and his to us. This [is] the order of   the Holy Priesthood and we shall continue to administer in the ordin-  ances of the kingdom of God here on Earth. Joseph will not officiate   in this low capacity any more neither did Jesus after his Resur-  rection if so he would have baptized Saul but he was exhalted above   the Earth and he told Saul to go to a certain man in a certain street   & he would administer to him the ordinances upon the Earth. I say   to you dont hurry in the ordinances dont do what you ought   not it is not time to hurry we should not under take to do now   what we ought to do 50 years hence. what have we to do to day. Purify   your hearts that you may receive the manifestation of the spirit   of God. When you sow your wheat you prepare the ground then  sow your wheat & watch it untill the hearvest it is Just so in the   priesthood you will be just as busy as you can be to do the things   which are to be done to day. Now dont be in a hurry I say we are going   to have time enough. I say I will be on the Earth to do all I can. And  after I die & get my body again my resurrected body I mean to come   back to the Earth again and fight the Devils and be here at the winding up   scene I want to see righteousness prevail & the saints have peace on the earth      I wish now to speak upon another subject I am here as the   Governor of this Territory. And I wish to commence my remarks   upon this subject with the President of the United States. Is he the   Master of the United States no he is not. He is selected to sit there     
 as one of our servants to act for us to do what we wish to have done   so it is with the congress & the Governors of the several States and   I am here as one of them as the servant of the people. Congress  has prepared a constitution for this Territory which they call   the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people as   a community. They have said this Territory should be organized   thus & so with a Govornor & Legislative Assembly and the   right is given to the people to select 26 Representatives & 13   councellors Annually this body may enact Laws to controll each   of us & all the inhabitants of this Territory including the governor   the Judges the Secretary the supreme coart the District court   & the Probate court. they have said they shall have all the   power given to them by the Legislative assembly we have a Legislative   Assembly & Magistrates courts congress will send certain men  to hold supreme courts & send other men as officers to the Territory   of Utah to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to   make it as easy as possible. The United States Judges are not   here as Kings or Monarchs but as servants of the people   And when you see a Judge puting a city under Martial Law they   manifest Boyism & you should pitty them & give them a peace of   cake. If a man wants to be what he is not it is certain that He   wants to get out of his sphere. when some men know a   hundred words He thinks he knows all of webster some will  try to study a hundred sciences of the day & then know no   more than a child. when a person studies Divinity 5 years  they are ownly fit to be put down upon the ground as a block   to stand upon to get upon your horses. I see some here who   have come 50 or 100 miles at the squa[w]king of a goose crow &   dont you know if you want a court had there that the   Judge should go there & hold it. And if a Judge dont know this   it is because he is vary ignorant And He ought to ◊ ◊ learn his   duty. I am perfectly asstonished at these my Brethren to think   that if a man takes a pumpkin & says it is an Apple you must  acknowledge that it is an Apple & swallow it as such or if they   take a rotton potatoe & say it is a peach then cram it down your   throat as a peach. when you see a rotton Potatoe why dont you   acknowledge it is a rotten potatoe. Now I say to you Jurymen   & witnesses pack up your dudds & go home & stay there till you   have business. If I come here & act the tyrant insted of a Gover-  nor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought to be   served in the same way when they get out of the way & act the fool   or els let the people swallow the rotten potatoe & call it a peach   I know the meaning the marrow & the pith of the Laws and the   vary principle upon which they are built much better than the   Judges do I know the meaning of them & the Duty of all the  officers in this Territory I say this for your instruction      To see men come here at the calling of a foolish boy, freezing   your toes & killing your horses in the cold month of December is foolish-  nesh when you want him send for him & pay your respects to   him but they do not understand the Law. take some of the   boys & learn them sumthing and treat them as Gentlemen & make   them treat you as a Gentleman. when I see Lawyiers & Judges rising   up here & saying that our laws are not right & we should not   be governed by them, It puts me in mind of the Anecdote of the     
 of the fox that went to a hen coop to cketch some chickens the owner had   had put a cord from the platform to a Bell ove[r]head so as soon as the   platform was tuched the bell would ring as soon as the fox jumped   onto the platform the bell rung & away the fox run with all his might but   on looking behind him he saw nothing so he went back to the coop & examined  to see what the matter was He touched the cord with his foot & it rung but   did no hurt so he jumped into the coop & got his chicken He looked up   & saw the bell was hollow & had a longue tongue & the Fox exclaimed   you are a poor miserable hollow headed Devil. Lawyiers & Judges should   be made to keep the Laws of this Territory as well as other citizens & if they   wont do it put them in a the way that they will be made to. And I   say to evry man who has no business here pack up your goods & go home   Let the Judges honor me, & our laws & the officers of this Territory   or they will not receive any honor from me.      I see one man on my right who will go strait & tell the judges   what I have said he is a kind of perpetual Telegraph and if any  man come to me & says Brother Brigham do you mean me I will   say you are the Man.

I am just begining to get my eyes open I [k]now that President Youngs  talk is good what He says is so. He tells us more good I am like the sun   just rising in the East & so with my people we have been in the night   I have had Eyes but I could not see, & ears but I could not hear   & this has been the case with my people our hearts could not understand   but now our eyes see, our hears hear, & our hearts understand, all that   Brigham & Heber has said is strait. But when I talked to Col   Steptoe & his men their talk was not strait. I could not believe for   a tenth part of their talk is not true & so with the spanyards & all   white people till I saw the mormons they are the first to tell me the   truth. You are here to make laws I hope you will make good   laws to punish the guilty & spare the innocent. I wish to do right   & have my people do right. I do not want them to steal nor kill   I want to plant & raise wheat & learn to plough & it isdo as the white   people do this I am going to do in the spring. I want to learn to   read & right & have my children so we can understand what you say   to us that is good      [rest of page blank]

G D Watt reported &   it is published in the [blank] No [blank] Vol of the Deserett News I   attended prayer meeting in the evening circle. President Young asked   Elder Orson Pratt what He thought of his preaching that intelligent   beings would continue to learn to all Eternity. O. Pratt said that He believed   the Gods had a knowledge at the present time of evry thing that ever   did exhist to the endless ages of all Eternity. He believed it as much   as any truth that he had ever learned in or out of this church. President   Young remarked that he had never learned that principle in the Church   for it was not taught in the church for it was not true it was fals doctr-  in. For the Gods & all intelligent Beings would never scease to learn   except it was the sons of perdition they would continue to decrease   untill they became dissolved back into their native Element & lost   their Identity.      In speaking of this people He said   if they would behave half deesent thiey would not be driven away from   this place      I attended meeting at the 14th ward school House in the evening Elder   P. P. Preached a good discourse. He told the bishop to cut off all the   Liars thieves, Adulterers, & profane swarers from the church for they   would rot the body if they continued on it. and many wicked men   would stick by the church but they would never repent of their   sins their was a time when men could repent & have the spirit   of God but when that time was past men might pray till their   knees were callaced & they could not get the spirit of God. How long did   the people that were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could have   the offer of the spirit of God or the gospel, they had to wait more than two   thousand years till after Christ came & was crusiphfied. He then went   & preached to the spirits in Prision. the gospel was then offered unto   them. And how has it been with the Jews they once saw the day when the     
 gospel was offered unto them but when they put to death   their king & savior the gospel was taken from them & given to the   gentiles it was also given to the Lamanites & ten tribes of Israel. the   first were to be last & the last first it will now come to the gentiles   first then to the ten tribes of Israel & to the Lamanite before it will go   to the Jews they will be the last to received it who has ever herd   of the Jews having the spirit of God, or the Gospel, or kingdom of God   offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Christ & the kingdom   went to the Gentiles. No one for it has never been done. they will go   home in unbelief & wickedness & rebuild Jerrusalem in that state & they   will be so far from the gospel that when the Gentiles come against them   to battle rifle their houses ravish their women & carry half of their   city into captivity & Jesus Christ comes & delivers them in the midst   of this hour ^of^ perrill & trouble they will not know him or even imagin   Ho he is till they ask him about his wounds & he tells them that   the gospel has to be preached to them & they repent & are baptized & receive   the first principles of the gospel.      He also said their was a promise   that the three Nephites & angels should visit the Lamanites but they could  not be sent to them with messages to receive & obey the Mormons untill   all the Mormon Missionaries were righteous men & would not steal, lie,   sware or commit Adultery for if the Angels were to tell them to obey   the Mormons & they found the Mormons to do wickedly they would loose   confidence in both the Mormons & the Angels      February 18, 1856 ~ Monday      18th I spent the day in the committee room to work at Books      February 19, 1856 ~ Tuesday      19 I spent the day in the committee room I attended a party at   Mrs Kimballs school house with her schollars the evening was spent   in dancing & speaking      February 20, 1856 ~ Wednesday      20 I spent this day in the committe room      February 21, 1856 ~ Thursday      21st I spent this day in the committee room & the evening in  the seventies Hall with the Polosophical society & herd many good   Essays speeches, songs & musical entertainment we had a good time      February 22, 1856 ~ Friday      22nd I spent the day in the committe room & attended two meeting   in the evening one the Horticultural society & chose J.

He then took up the subject of the courts as held in   Great Salt Lake City and also the ungodly course of the Lawyers who   carry on those courts. He cursed them in the Name of the Lord with   a great curse & All Israel said Amen. He spoke in the spirit &   power of God He called Zerubabel Snow by name & he cursed   him and all that He had.

 for how can we Hate our Brother whom we have seen &  love God whom we have not seen. again if we have  ought against our Brother we should go to him &  be reconciled & not go to law & if we do wrong or  injure the feelings of another unjustly we should ask  forgiveness & make recincileation & when a person gets   a thorrough victory over themselves in thes matters they  gain a far greater victory than they would in taking   sebastipol. I listened with attention to the remarks   of Brother Clements upon the subject of Prayer I believe  the Lord Hears prayers we had a sample of this in Harm[on]y   the grasshopers had destroyed the crops in the settlements  north of us & they began to approach our fields & began   upon our grain we called a meeting & made the matter   a subject of prayer at night we went out next  morning & there was no live grass hoppers to be to   seen but the ground was coverd with dead ones I have   spoken of my mission among the Lamanites the question has   been asked will the Lamanites work I will say that the  Lamanites work hard whare I have been some of them   have worked for me & they would do more hard labour   in a day than I could while making our picket fort two  of the Indians would cut 100 cedar Pickets in a  day. I have known old Indians plant Acres of land   & dig up the ground with a paddle & when they saw us   plough the ground they rejoiced much to see how much  faster we could turn over the ground with an Iron plough   than they could with a woodden paddle. Brother   Parley pratt said I was ingaged in the best ^work^ I could  be ingaged in I feel that we are bringing that people  to a knowledge of the things of God when I have traveled   among them they have treated me vary kind I called upon  a chief one day & I was hungry. His squaw went to work  & dryed some wheat heads by the fire rubed out the wheat  in her hands put it onto a smooth stone & took another  smooth round stone & ground it fine & made me a   cake of it & baked it by the fire while she was doing  this her daughter made me some good wine out  of some buries she had preserved so I had bread &  wine for my dinner, all manufactured in a few  moments. they rejoiced at our visit with them &  many of them have been baptized & in some instances  try to imitate our practices. In one instance a company   of three came to visit us all highly painted up & dressed   in the best they had when they came to us we told them   the mormons did not paint they went to the creek &   washed it all off. we feel that much good is begining to   be done among that People      October 21, 1855 ~ Sunday      Sunday Oct 21 Meeting opened by singing & prayer  By T D Brown at 10 oclock. Brother Lorenzo D Young   addressed the People in the forenoon. He spoke upon the subject  of setting up the kingdom of God on the Earth in our day & the   blessings which God will give us & refered to the coming of   Christ in the flesh to the Jews who were looking for a     
 Great king to come to come sit upon the throne of David  spake of the crusifixion of Christ. His blood was shed &   that Nation had to be chastized in consequence of it &   they deserved it for they were worthy we know the   Blood of Christ was shed for the redemption of mankind  He spoke of the Endowments in the temple said the people always  were afraid of the truth & always prejudiced against the profits  of God but that did not stop the spread of the work of God, some   say shall we stay here long I do not know but I can say that  we shall stay as long as we wish to. If all the Nations of the   Earth were to come against us they could not drive us away   if we doing our duty before the Lord & put our trust in him  & do unto all men as we would wish to be done by in all things  & if all will do this we shall not have much trouble in the  kingdom of God some think that we have not as much faith  as we used to have I cannot believe this I believe we are  advanceing in the kingdom of God. some are much tryed   because all are not healed that they lay hands upon but I do not feel  so I had a case during conference concerning the case of   Sister Baris she was sick & I laid Hands upon her & blessed  her with life & helth & went to meeting in an hour I had   word that she was dead. it did not try me. the Lord saw fit to  take her & all is right. there is many duties devolving upon us  & one of these duties are to pay our debts if I owe a man   & He comes to me & says you owe me so much & I need it   in my family I will pay that man to the full extent of   my power I will divide the last loaf with him. I consider   this one of our duties & I will say I never knew   a man get rich by taking great Interest neither   do I ever expe[c]t to. He requested the Brethren  to remember the Twelve & administer in temporal  things while they Administered in spiritual things      Sunday PM. Elder O. Pratt addressed the Assemb  He arose & said I should have been pleased to have heard  from Brother Woodruff & others if [I] had not been caled  upon to speak I dont know when I have been mor  Edifyed than in the discourses I have heard at this   conference esspecially the discours of Brother Parley   yesterday morning it was so plain & simple I tried   to enter into the feelings of the speaker. I tryed to  bring mysel[f] to this scene & fancied to mysel[f] how I  would feel in Hearing the message of Glad tidings that  a savior was born & also in being associated with him  in life then the sorrow of his being taken away & crucified   then the great Joy in his resurrection & his teachings  while in his Immortal body. but when I think of  the greater things which are to take place in our  day I do not regret that I did not live in that day  for there are greater things to come forth than was  manifest in that day. For that kingdom of God of which  all the prophets have spoken since the world began has now   come forth as a preparation for the second coming of  Christ not coming to be born in a manger but He will     
 come From Heaven clothed with all that great Glory & power  of which the prophets have spoken no are we preparing for  th^i^se great Event now if a stranger was to come to us  they would not suppose that we were preparing for this  great Event but was merely cultivating the Earth to raise  potatoes corn wheat &c. I do not believe for a moment   that is the case for I do believe that this people are preparing  for the Coming of Christ. what will take place at that  time I have red in the book of mormon what that book  says will take plase we can read the great things that are  spoken in that Book. (He read some unto the people) I will  take it to myself I will ^having^ not been as diligent in readi[ng]  that Book as I should have been I have red many other  books of late but not so much in the book of Mormon as formerly  I have seen the time that I could read nearly whole Books  in the book of Mormon without looking upon that book I am   trying to get all the sayings in the Books in my own mind   that are spoken concerning the signs of the times in the day   in which we live for I am well aware that it will over-  take many as a thief in the night in the midst of the saints  now let us look at the tokens or signs of the times that  are passing before us as many as present themselves   to our minds. I will read a revelation given to P P P[r]att  & others "Jesus Christ will not come in the form of   a woman nor like a man walking upon the face of the  Earth. but look forth for the Heavens to be shaken & the  mountains to be laid low &c. when shall thes things be  when the Angel shall sound his trumpet two events will  take place at the same time, also the Lord said the La-  manites shall Blossom as the rose in the wilderness now   we know that this will not take place in a moment   for we know it will take some time to prepare the   Lamanites for this work it will require a great  miracle to bring that people to that state or it will  take some great changes to bring it about this is but   one of the Events that is to take place before the coming  of Christ. I am glad to hear the account of the brethren  who have gone among that people I am satisfied that   that people will not be prepared to receive the blessings of  God untill they cultivate the Earth & when this [is] done we   shall Have accomplished the great work but ^not^ untill that   time is done then sumthing will be done then we  will be inspired to teach them. & ther children and   all men will be blessed who labour faithfully to bring   them to this state of things. Jacob shall flourish in   the wilderness the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose  we shall hear of Israel and of their prophets & Revelations   in other parts of the Earth. I do not say that they will   have the priesthood from this people nor I do not   say they will not for there are other men who hold  the [FIGURE] keys of the kingdom of God on the earth the Revela-  tor & the three Nephits hold the keys of the kingdom  of God & they will administer unto the children of men  Zion shall flourish upon the Hills & rejoice excedingly     
 upon the mountains when this revelations was given  there was no gathering at all Joseph had got to Kirtland  I have no idea that the prophet himself knew at that   time whare this would be. we are now here in the  mountains in fulfillment of that Prophesy and   Revelation. Also in the 40th chapter of Isaiah com-  forting words were spoken concerning the Jews & Jerrusalem  they were to go to Jerrusalem for they had received  double reward for all their sins now comfort them  a did all thes things take place in the wilderness in Zion  & in Jerrusalem in the days of the ^Birth of the^ Savior No they did not  then that same John Had yet to do a great work in the   Earth in the last days who first delivered the priesthood   to Joseph Smith the prophet & founder of the Church of   Christ in this dispensation it was this same John the   Baptist so he has fullfilled a part of his last day mis-  sion. O Zion get the[e] up into the High mountains that  bringest good tidings we say that this was not   done at its first organization. why shall Zion get   up into the High mountains w[h]y to Judge the Nations of  the Earth. this people will know righteous Judgment  this people will be protected & shall Judge the people   of the Earth. it is said God will pour out knowledge   & power upon Zion these [are] some of the things that will  take place before the coming of Christ. now that we may  know that this is the case see what the Lord says  Behold the Lord will come He will gather his people  & carry them in his arms. we have come up Here  in these mountains. well now have we flourished  yes we have, we have flourished yet not as much  as we shall. the Lord has said that we shall be the rival  of all people yet we are cautioned to beware of pride   lest we become like the Nephites of old & some pro[p]h[e]ts  have said that we should be chastized that the church  wandered in the wilderness were faint & ready to fall down  this people from the commencement have passed through  oppression & difficulty we that have not been in the  church from an Early day & do not know the History  of it can learn it by reading the News published   in Salt Lake City and we can Just as well read  the future History & events of this church by reading  the prophets that have spoken concerning us. shall  we be in these mountains when Christ comes No  at least head quarters will not be here it will have  to be on more ground it will be in Jackson Co Mo  we may leave some Millions here but the Head quarters  will be on more ground where shall we go to the new   Jerrusalem whare there will be built a great Capitol  & Temple & we have got to build it, we & all our children   who are 8 years old know that when we have tryed  to build a city the Lord has suffered it to be thrown down  so that we may have experince so that we shall know   how to build up a New Jerrusalem so that it will  be exceptable unto the Lord so that it will never be  thrown down but be saved & taken into Heaven     
 and preserved in Eternity & when that is done Jesus Christ   will come to visit it Angels will come that will be   before the great day of Christ coming & our dwellings will   be overshadowed bwith a cloud by day & a pillow of fire   by night so we can see to get home without stumbling  it will be the most improved plan of ligh[t]ing up our   City. How will it be with the Lamanites they will   be the most important actors in the scene we shall   be secondly in that work they will be so delightful   & have such great knowledge of Architecture that   they will be able to build up a New Jerrusalem   then we shall go out throughout all the land to   gather all the remnant of Jacob the Lamanites to come   to the New Jerrusalem what For why that they may   be prepared to be caught up to meet Christ in the clouds   of Heaven then Christ will come & stand in the midst   of this people & they will be prepared to be caught up to   meet Jesus Christ in the air then do I want to have   lived in the day when Christ was born no I do not   I would rath[er] live in this age now some of us may   live in that day to see the seed of Israel gathered what   should you expect we should expect to see Jesus come   but should we see him come without any sign No we   should see Angels flying through the Heavens crying   to all the Earth to prepare for the great day of Judgment   is coming what next should we see there will be a   sign that all people will see in all the Earth as Israel   made a calf to worship so will there be five foolish   virgins in the midst of all these signs. what shall   we hear then. we shall hear another Trumpet   sounded saying that the great day of God will come   upon Babylon that her bands are made strong so   that No man can loose them then shall the curtain   of Heaven be unfolded as a scroll so you can see   it as you would gaze upon a map then you may   know the time has come for the saints of God to be   caught up into Heaven that will be the great day for   the saints of God, but awful to the wicked then the   Earth will reel to & fro like a drunken man it will   be the greatest Earthquake there ever has been   On Earth what next will take place the graves of   the saints will be opened & they will come forth   out of their gravs clothed with glory Immortality   & Eternal life & Enter in to the cloud Jesus Christ   does not come yet for there is other signs to take   place. The Angels are to sound there Trumpets O   what must be the feelings of the people of all the Earth   when they see the Heavens opened & the New Jerrusa-  lem with all its inhabitants & the resurrected saints all   asscend into the cloud while they are left upon the Earth   there feelings must be awful. there are many more   things I might speak of but time will not permit.   There is many of the greatest things to take place in our   day that has ever taken place on Earth are we prepared   I think not I mourn over this people to see them so     
 stupid I feel that there hearts are more set upon the   things of their farms than they are to prepare for the   great day of the Lord. I pray the Lord to Bless us &   give us his Holy spirit to prepare us for his kingdom &   comeing for Christ sake Amen      at 7 oclock in the evening the people again assembled &   filled the House and they were addressed by W. Woodruff who   said Brethren & Sisters I am truly glad to meet with you in   the capacity of a quarterly conference & visit you as a mission   I am truly thankful that I have a mission appointed me in con-  nextion with Parley P & Orson Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for   it is the first time since the organization of this church & Quorum   that I have had this privilege of being associated together with   those two men on a preaching mission ownly as we have met   ain a conference from time to time to transact business as a Quo[ru]m   I called them Apostles, is it true that they are apostles it is eith[er true]  or false, if it false then your faith is vain your religion is   vain you have not the Kingdom of God with you nor the priesthood   with the blessings have you. but if you they are true Apostles   then you have the kingdom of God with you the Priesthood & the   keys of the kingdom of God & a presidency who hold the keys of the   kingdom of God on the Earth & govern that kingdom for the benefit   of the people then you are bound to listen to our words & teaching &   to the teaching of the presidency of this Church. when I arived in this   place I spent the night at Brother Steeds after I retired to   rest I prayed to the Lord to show me what he wished me to teach   to the people the spirit of the Lord said to me teach the people   to obtain the Holy spirit that they may receive teaching   then let the missionaries keep the spirit of the Lord with  them & that will constantly dictate them what to teach   you have had a flood of light poured out upon you since the   commencement of this conference & we should listen to it   we should pay particular attention to our children & teach   them good things & not permit them to spend their time   in reading novels & filling their minds with fals hood &   folly & things wharein there is no profit which will lead   them asstray & make them fit subjects for destruction   when this is the case through the parents neglect they will   have to answer for that sin. The Bible Book of Mormon   & Doctrins & Covenant should be read by our children   instead of French novels & negro songs for whatever seed   is sown in the minds of our children the same kind of fruit   will be produced  [rest of page blank]

W. Woodruff addressed the people &   said that when I look upon the mountains & vallies & hills &   dales & both in the Heavens & on Earth I behold a great   variety in all the works of God & in looking upon the portr-  ait of the Presidency & Twelve I see no two men or things   look alike & what constitutes a part of the glory of God   is the great variety of his works so in the preaching of the   Presidency & Twelve each man might preach upon a different   subject & Handle it in a different manner yet all by the   same spirit & will edify the people. so I feel incouraged to think   that notwithstanding such a great flood of light & truth   has been presented to this people since the commencement of this   conference that the Lord will still give me sumthing that may  edify the people this evening. I would warn the people to give   heed to the strong teachings & exertations which they have     
 had presented to them during this conference this people should   give themselves to the studying of the revelations of God as con-  tained in the Bible book of Mormon & Doctrin & Covenants      Some have thought they should follow the living Oracles &   neglect the study of all other Revelations but this is not   so all men should follow & harken to the living Oracles of   God but they should not neglect the study of the scriptures for   God has commanded it and any man that will search the   revelations of God thouroughly will be far better prepared   to carry out the council of the living oracles at all times      their is another subject that I wish to speak of & that is the   principle of recording the dealings of God with us here on   the Earth while all other prophets & Apostles record the dealings   of God with them why should not the Elders of this last dispensation   it is true that the Prophet Joseph wrote the History of the church   in his day & that testiment is now gladdening the harets [hearts] of   thousands while the testator is dead so with the Presidency   of the Church who are now leading us they keep a History   of the dealings of both God & man with them the History of   which will be interesting to millions of future generations   but does this excuse the many thousands of Elders & High   priest & Apostles who have travelled for many years & built   up this church & kingdom & had the gifts of the Holy Ghost   with them so they have had power to heal the sick & cast   out devils open the eyes of the blind unstop the ears of the deaf   cause the lame to leap as an heart & commanded the Elements   & they obey them. & have had guardian Angels to preserve   them from Danger & Death I say shall the Elders be blessed   with these things & not count them worth recording not   even make the mark of a pen to leave the Account on   record for their children & future generations to read I say   they should. I think the Lord requires this at our hands   & it is a Rich & Holy legacy which is Justly due our posterity  And I do desire that the Elders of this church would keep a   history & Journal of their lives I also wish that our young   men would become acquainted with Phonography that we may   have one thousand reporters whare we have one now that   they may report the teachings of the servants of God & the work   of God in this generation many other remarks I made to the   people concerning the gathering of Israel & other subjects & was   followed by Elder Orson Pratt the spirit & power of God   rested us all during the conference I laid on hands upon a   sick woman with Brother Orson Pratt      November 19, 1855 ~ Monday      19th In company with Orson Pratt I administered to 2 of   Bishop Stokers children who were sick with the mountain fever  we then returned to salt Lake city with Brother P.

Babbit arose &   insulted the Assembly to a great Degree by threatening them that their   bills should not be paid if they printed that Number he wished to dictate   to the assembly what they should do which was out of his place. The   Govornor arose & gave the Secretary a hard lashing with his Tongue   & said he ought to be kicked out of the house. as a poor miserable   dog.

O. Pratt Preached one hour upon the gifts   & graces the importance of our calling upon God by mighty Prayer &   faith in order that we might rend the veil and obtain those blessings   which the Ancients obtained He made many interesting remarks He   was followed by Loren Farr who gave an exhortation to the people   upon what Brother Pratt had said urged the people to give heed   to the council of the servants of God     
 [FIGURE] I followed Brother Farr the following is a synopsis of the remarks   which I made. Brethren & sisters I count it a privilege to   Join my Brethren in bearing my testimony of the things of God I   have a feelings of solemnity resting upon my mind concerning  our duties as a people this feelings is increasing upon me daily   I can bear testimony that what brother Pratt has said is true   The Lord has a meaning in sending the Apostles & Elders into   the vineyard in this Territory to preach to the Saints, and I know   as God lives that the same spirit that rested upon the Ancient   Prophets before some great Event has rested upon the Ancient   Apostles & Elders upon this mission the spirit of God has rested  upon them to prophesy & teach great things in the name of the   Lord. I feel that as Prophets, Apostles & Elders we have no   time to sleep, slumber, & rest upon our lees & feel that we   have nothing to do but eat, Drink, dance & be merry for I   know there is a mighty responsibility resting upon us as a   people & we have no time to loose or throw away if we do our duty   to God to the Gentile Nations, to the whole House of Israel, to Zion &   Jerrusalem, & are prepared ourselves for the great & mighty Events   which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning. Look at   the House o David the tribe of Judah alone see the rivers of Blood   which have run from their veins shed by the hands of the gentiles   for the Last 1800 years by the hand of Evry gentile Nation   under heaven their rivers of Blood have quenched the flames   of their burning Temples synagogues & cities their treanches &   Cities have been filled with their mangled bodies left unburied   untill the stench has asscended up towards heaven from Generat-  ion to Generation evry Gentile Nation have demanded tribute   taxation of them beyong [beyond] Endurance & persecuted them unto death   The old Jewish Rabbies & Priest have turned their faces tow-  ards Gerrusalem for 1800 y[e]ars & cryed unto God in great sorrow   & affliction. the God of Abraham has declared that the day   should come when their afflictions should scease & they should   be redeemed deliverd from the Gentile yoke redturn to Jerrusalem   rebuild Jerrusalem & their Temple & have great blessings again   given them by the hand of the God of their Fathers but for all   these blessings He would be inquired of by the House of Israel   to do int for them. The dawning of that day has come, the  fulness of the Gentiles is fast coming in, the time has come   for them to begin to go home to Jerrusalem but who is to ask   for this blessing at the hand of God is it required at the hand of the   Jews alone their is a veil ostill over them the kingdom of God   is taken from ^them^ the Priesthood with its keys & powr is not within   their reach by which they can rend the veil of Eternity in   order to obtain thes blessings at the hand of the God of ther fathers  they have not a partical of faith in the name or blood of the   son of God but they are doomed to go home & build their   city in unbelief then at whose hands does the God of heaven   require these things. It is at your hands O ye Latter Day   Saints you are of the house of Israel linege of Joseph through the   tribe of Ephraim your fathers have been mixed with the   Gentiles & God has called you out & given unto you the kingdom   with all its powers & Blessings He has given you the Holy Priesthood   & taken the veil from off your eyes & you are the ownly people     
 under Heaven who now hold these blessings & know &   see the things of God in the true light. Hence the Lord requires   this people to call upon God day & night for the redemption of   this branch of the House of Israel that his promises may be   fulfilled concerning them. Inasmuch as we cannot do any   thing for the Jews but give them our prayers we should not   with hold that blessing from them. Again let us turn our   thoughts to the Lamanites of who are of the linage of Joseph   who surround us in these mountains & vallies who are also cursed   & cast down below the brute creation there is also a thick dark   veil still hanging over them the God of Joseph has said they   should be redeemed & become a white & Delightsome people here   the Lord requires sumthing els at our hands besides praying we   have manual laborur & work to do we have them to redeem   no body els will attempt it. our duties are great towards   that people. we have carried the Gospel to the Gentiles Nations   & they have rejected it & our own Nation has shed the best blood   that rolls in the veins of men, they have slain the prophets &   saints & driven the whole Church & kingdom of God into   these mountains in the midst of the Lamanites here the ark of   God rests shall we cover it up & let it rest idle I say no   the Lord requires the salvation of this branch of the house of   Israel at our hands. As Prophets, Apostles, Elder & Saints of   God we have no time to loose or sleep upon our oars & wait   for somebody els to perform the work. we have it to do & the time   has come. I know the day is at our door when the worship of   that people will be excepted at the hands of God they will be   visited by the Holy messengers of God who will be coworkers   with us then let us call upon God earnestly in their behalf   & do our duty towards them & they will soon stand in Holy   places & recieve the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood & appreciate   them & do a great work which will be excepted of the Lord thes   things are resting upon my mind with great wait day &   night. If we as a people have fallen asleep it is time we   awoke to our duty or we shall come under condemnation as   a people who bear the Priesthood.      I feel to give Brother Orson   Pratt my heart & hand in Joining him in calling upon God that   we may rend the veil that we may obtain greater Blessings   from God. we must pray earnestly in order to obtain the   Holy spirit. many other remarks were made which are not now   written       [FIGURE] I wrote a letter this morning to Mrs Woodruff   & to my son Wilford & Daughter Phebe which I sent by   Mr Babbit who started for the salt Lake City he felt better   this morning & did not take away the funds belonging to the   Legislature as he threatened he would      December 13, 1855 ~ Thursday      13th I met with the Legislative counsel we adjourned untill monday   to give the committies time to bring in business & the carpenters time   to finish the room      December 14, 1855 ~ Friday      14th I spent the day reading & writing I attended the meeting during   the evening. The meeting was addressed by Phineas Young who   spoke of the Lamanites said He had distributed the Books of     
 mormon to the various Indians Chiefs from the Cherekees   to Florida He gave Ross the Cherikee chief one he made   many remarks upon that subject. He made one Error   in saying that the Indians would not imbrace the work   of God or be gathered by the Gospel untill they had gone   through among the Gentiles & trodden them down as   the Book of mormon declairs. But the book of Morm-  on declairs that they shall be gathered      He was followed by Lorenzo Snow & Samuel Richards   both spoke much to the Edification of the People      December 15, 1855 ~ Saturday      15th [FIGURE] I wrote 7 letters to my family to Mrs Woodruff   to Phebe, Susan, Bulah, Moroni Emma & Sarah which   I sent By mail. I spent the afternoon on a committy  on Education      December 16, 1855 ~ Sunday      16th Sunday [FIGURE] the mail came in to day & brought me   a letter from Mrs Woodruff. P. P. Pratt Preached to   the People in the forenoon upon the practical duties of life  but I was at home writing. President Young Preached in   the afternoon & I reported his sermon the following is   a synopsis of the same      President Youngs text was Arise & shine O Zion for ^thy light is come^   & the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. He said I have   always felt since I have been called to preach to speak of the   practical things of evry day life instead of some great misteries   a long way ahead in tEtearnity which the people do not know nor   never will as the thing tought does not exhist I felt in the   begining of my being called to the ministry that I had no right   to preach except I was filled with the spirit of Revelation   & prophesy as the Ancients & I feel the same to day in order   to be qualified to preached we should be filled with Reve-  lation I do not consider that any man is qualified to preach the   Gospel & the sayings of the prophets unless he is filled with the   spirits of the prophets. We are commanded to arise & shine   but for us to sit down & say that we believe in this work   we believe that ^Joseph^ was a Prophet, and still not carry out the  work which we are commanded to do, not to build up or   beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss of our aim   we shall not enter into the Celestial kingdom we shall not   enter through the gates. We must show to the Lord that   we are willing to fulfill What he requires of us and   this we shall not do unless we are willing to arise & shine,   but how are we to [do] it, we have got to build up Zion, and   we have got to make Zion the most holy and polished, Refined   & beautiful place upon the face of the whole Earth. So we may  expect to see Zion in all that beauty majesty & glory which   God has spoken of. But the people do not understand the   things of God. I will prophesy that unless this people   will rise up & build up Zion as God has commanded   them they will be removed out of their place & another   people will be raised in their stead who will perform the work   & this I say in the name of God. I also say in the name of the Lord   that the desendants of Ephraim who are among the Gentiles     
 are the first born and they are the first ones to receive th[e]  fulness of the Gentiles gospel in this dispensation they are the first  to be gathered together and this work was not to be given to  any other in the begining of this kingdom, this has been done.  the Ephraimites are before me here to day. Now if I was to   ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would   say yes. But let me tell you ther is not one of you that  are willing to do as you are told. I have given the people  council for years past how to build their forts, walls, Cities   Houses, & how to begin to beautify & adorn Zion but have   the people done as I have told them in these things, no. You   may say these are of miner consequences. But let me  tel you that if you are not willing to do the small things that  is necessary ^on earth^ then you are not willing to do as you are told   in heaven. & you will loose your glory and exhaltation  Now do you not remember that I told you years ago to go to  & build up a beautiful city in this place but there has been   nothing done towards it. we have many that have been in   the Church for quite a number of years & yet we have  not a Builder or Architect that knows enough to build   the meanest house of any kind not even a kitchen in  the New Jerrusalem. Then how can we build up the   New Jerrusalem? I have told the people all the day long  to be prepared to build up this city. And I will say that  if we could take all the knowledge that exhists among evry   nation upon the face of the whole Earth & boil it down into   an essenc & put it all into one man He would not know  enough to lay the first stone in the wall around the New  Jerrusalem to say nothing about building the city & Temple  we have got to improve continually and build up good  cities & adorn & beautify Zion and let me tel you that   if you do not come to thisat place ^whare^ you will not stand set  your heart on any riches or gold you are not worthy to  do the work of God, and if this people do not build up  Zion they will be moved out of their place. evry time we   build a House or city we should better it, evry thing around  us should be neat & clean. now look at this building for  a school house. the ground around this building should be   prepared for a play ground, & kept neat & Clean & prep[ar]ed   so as to make the child Happy. Children should be in a clean   plase but how is it here. the moment the children step out  of door they see nothing but filth all the day long. the   minds of our children while young are pure & they should   not spend their time in filthy places for it affects their   minds & feelings they should be in a clean place, for  they are visited by the Angels of God but parents do not  realize this although it is true. Yo[u] may say I do not have   time to keep my dwellings, school Houses, door yards &c  clean, no nor you never will have till you die upon the same   principle, but you should take time. now it should not take  a week till I would clean out my door Yard. But   the people in this Territory have not had time to clean  out their door yards, or to make any thing els they ought  to do. I will show you that I will set an example for     
 my children to follow, I will teach those things which we  ought to do to day. I have preached this doctrin from the  begining the first time I ever preached was to tell the  people the duties of to day. now if you had all the gold in  the world what would you do would you go to calafornia No  but go to & build up Zion. You may say their is no calafornia   here we have no gold, but it is not gold that is going to bui[l]d  up Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but we have   it to do with our hands.  You can make a begining & do  sumthing, you can set an example, you can clean out your   house & yard & make that clean, & you can stop the Bed  bugs from runing around you. I do not see the first   fruit or shade tree in this city. come up to the Salt Lake   City & get some Fruit trees & set out & have some fruit  growing. Now this is Zion and the light has come, & shines  upon you & you are call upon to build up Zion. How by going  to Calafornia No, for there is millions of Gold here & the Lord  will send it in sight when He thinks it is best ^for us to Have it^ as He did in  Calafornia. If you think it is not best to come here go back  to Missouri. Old Father Harris said that He would stay  at Kanesville so when the church got ready to go back  to Jackson County He would have but a short way to go [what]  the people here wood, brother G. A. Smith told him He migh[t]   Happen to find it much the nearest way there by the   way of the Rocky moutains & many will find that  to be the case the longest way around will be the shor[t]est way   there. we have been called great speculators & misers  I have told the people I was the greatest miser & speculator  in the world, for I am laying plans to try to obtain evry  thing there is on Earth & in heaven that is good that is  what I am after all the time. I have told the world that I   would possess Heven while they would become servents toin the  next world. my speculations are not confined to this world alone  Now I say go to & make a fine house in this place. You may  say I have not the capitol. vary well look at the salt Lake City  we have built up that city without capitol that was built  up with the strength of our hands which is our capitol  Now I want to say to the people here what do you say to  going out on to your lots to build to build your houses &   set out Fruits trees. Your wall around this fort is   not much protection you might as well stick up a row  of willows to scare & stop the Indians as any thing there  is here. Now go to & build up some good Houses in this  place I want to Join some 16 of the Brethren to come here   & build up some houses & a wall around it. but I shall build  humble here, I shall not build large, but I want you to lanch  outh and then come & see Salt Lake City & If I have not   beat you I will try again. I am determined to improve in all  the buildings I do while I live.  If we get our temple built I   mean to go to work & build another one as much better than  the one we are now building as this is better than the one  that we built in kirtland and this wing of the state House  which we have built here is a better building in its finish  & structure than that temple was. Now go to & do what God  requires of you. and what ever you want to get get lawfully     
 & then it will be a blessing to you allways & you will enjoy   it. But steal it & it will be a curse to you & cause you  sorrow & misery. Whenever I get so that I set my  heart upon Houses, lands, Gold or any thing Els on earth   so as to begin to turn my heart away from the Lord The   Just want to die before that comes to pass day before that   comes to pass I want the Lord to take me away. May God Bless  you Amen      President Heber C Kimball followed & said I felt quite well   in the forenoon but I do not feel well this afternoon in healt[h]  I know what President Young has said is true we have  come here & we have Dedicated this people & this place to  God. Now do the people realize why we are here no they do   not. we are here for the benefit of all Israel we have not  come here for a salary we have come here to do the w[ill]   of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our neck  & it shall never be put on again not on the necks of this  people. for if we do not do as God wants us to do he will raise   up a people that will do it. I tell you that God will smite any  people that undertake to stop this work. And I say that   what President Young has said is true you know that  what President Young has our children have to learn   the Alphabet first. So it is with this people the things  which God teaches us are small & simple in many respects  but they are just as necessary for us to learn & practice ias it  is for the child to learn his letters in order to understand  the Arts & sciences for we have to learn & practice small   things before we can obtain & carry out the greater things  of God. Now we are required to begin to build up &   adorn Zion we should set out fruit & shade trees I have   not done as much as I would liked to have done, but I have  raised some 15 bushels of peaches. President Young has   a large orchard he has raised a good many peaches & apples  & some 10000 1000 lbs of Good grapes as good as I ever  tasted. And that is as hard a place to live as there is  in these mountains. My wood for one fire cost me  some $175. These canyons are full of Good fruit which  you can get & set out. I have several kinds of good currants  which I got from the canyons which bear large & fine  fruit these things all help adorn the Earth, now go  to & build up this place & make a beautiful city. you have  a good place around the state house for a city & gardens  & orchards the soil is sandy & you have a plenty of ma[n]ure  to make it rich.      The people must learn & practice clean-  liness in this life some people think they can live all  their days in filth & dirt never even wash their bodies  then die & go to heaven & be clean but if you do not  learn & practice this lesson in this life you will have to learn  & practice it in the next before you will be received into the society  of those who are clean pure & holy. you have got to be  passive in the hands of God. As the prophet has said if  we are ^not^ passive in the hands of God as Clay is in the hands  of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whall  & flung into the batch & ground over again before we     
 we can be made vessels of honour what can we be made vessels  of honour after we have moved in the hands of the potter   & ground over again yes this will be the case with man but   it is far better to be passive in the hands of God & be made  a vessel of honor the first time than to wait thill till we   have to be ground over again this is a figure which the  prophet Jeremiahah made use of. Now President Young is  the Master Potter here on Earth & we should be subject to him   in all things we should all remember that we have got to render   up our stewardship to God therefore we should be faithful in   all things.

He said in 1829 He had this voice continually  ringing in his ears "Prepare ye the way of the Lord & make his  paths strait." After he was baptized he went to Kirtland &  told Joseph that He knew he was a Prophit of God & wanted   him to inquire of the Lord for him when he obtained the  revelation recorded in the Doctrins & Covenants given Nov 1830  recorded on Page 280 there the Lord told him to lift up his   voice long & Loud preparing the way for the second coming of the  Lord then I understood my former feelings.   I attended the meeting in the evening  Br Ray spoke 1st Phineas Young attempted   to speak to the people but vary soon choaked down with coughing   or sumthing in the throat & stoped. Erastus Snow followed &  spoke at Length in a vary interesting manner upon a great variety  of subjects much to the Edifycation of those who herd. Before the  close of the meeting I spoke to the people a few moments the following  are some of the remarks which I made      Brethren & sisters I feel to say a few words before closing I have  listened with attention to the teachings we have herd during  this afternoon & evening & I can bear testimony that they   are true. Elder Orson Pratt has spread before us this after-  noon the fulfillment of that grait chain of Prophesyies which  are to take place before the coming of the Mesiah like a great  panarama spread upon the wall so that evry person can see &  behold it. Now can we realize that these great & glorious events   are to transpire within 40 years even in our day & the days of  our children, no we cannot but yet it will be so. The President   has said that it was necessary to send missionaries through  this Territory to preach to the people in order to save them  this I believe is true we as a people have got to rise up &   become sanctifyed pure & holy in order to be prepared to meet  the great events which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of  lightning we have got to make up our minds whether we  will keep a Celestial Law or what Law we will keep. It is  necessary for us to send messengers of salvation to stir up the  minds of the people as long as there can be found an Adulterer

He was   followed By President Young in an interesting discourse upon   the subject of our building up the Kingdom of God, Having faith,   trusting in God under all circumstances in life his discourse   was reported.      I attended the Prayer circle whare I herd   some interesting teaching from President Young in social   conversation which was not reported. the following is a key   to some of the principles He advanced. He refered to the preach-  ing of Orson Pratt & Orson Hyde the sabbath before upon the subj-  ect of the resurrection. He said the Identical particles of matter   in which we had honored our spirits with ie our tabernacles in  which we had suffered, travelled, laboured, & built up the kingdom   of God that would be the Identical body & no other that would be   raised from the grave to immortality & Eternal life. Adam & Eve   had lived upon another Earth were immortal when they came here   Adam assisted in forming this Earth & agreed to fall when He   came Here & He fell that man might be & the opposite principle   to good the devel, the serpent, the Evil was plased upon the Earth that   man might know the good from the Evil for without an Experi[en]ce   in these things man could not know the one from the other as soon   as the devil was on Earth He sowed the seeds of Death in evry thing   so as soon as they began to eat of the fruit of the Earth they received   into their system the seeds of mortality & of Death so their children   wer mortal & subject to death sorrow pain & wo then when they   partook of life, Joy, ease, & Happiness they would know how to prize it   Father Adam would never scease his labours to redeem his posterity   & exhalt them to all the glory they were capable of receiving He did   not doubt but that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many   of his posterity would receive a Celestial glory & who they were &  also a Terrestrial & a Telestial yet man had his agency to act   chuse & refuse good or evil as seemed him good & he would be rew-  arded according to his works. O. Pratt asks will Adam or any God con-  tinue to make worlds people them taste of Death to redeem them     
 Answer I have no doubt but ^it^ is his privilege but whether that He   will do it is a question in my mind. How then can his seed increase   to all Eternity, through the increase of his posterity.      many other remarks were made by the President      May 7, 1855 ~ Monday      Monday 7th I bought 50 bushels of wheat at $100 & 900 lbs flour   for $54.

Woodruff Also L. D. Young Gilbert Clements T D   Brow & John Cook of the missionaries. The Quarter  Conference was opened by Prayer by O. Pratt. After  Singing P. P. Pratt Addressed the People for 2 1/2 hours  Evry missionary present had a cold sore throat & was   hoarse it had came on during the last 24 hours it was a  complaint that was quite universal among men women  & children many hundreds were Attacked in the same  way there was no change in the weather nor any thing  in the outward appearance of the Elements to cause it. Elder Pratt  was quite unwell He said He did not intend to Preach this fornoon  but He had got to Preach or go to bed. He spoke in a vary interesting  manner for 2 1/2 hours upon the subject of the birth Life Death  & resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text the 10 & 11   verses of the 2nd chapter of St Luke "And the Angel said unto them  fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great Joy which shall  be unto all people for unto you is born this day in the City of David     
 A Saviour which is Christ the Lord" This is the Saviour born in   Bethlehem of Judea. He said one cause of his ^why I^ taking this tex[t]  was ^is^ that a school teacher in Great Salt Lake City asked her  whole school if they would tell her whare Jesus was born  born & not one of them could tell her it is true they were   mostly small schollars but there was one almost a man  grown & he could not tell. I think there is a neglect among   this people in not teaching their children as they should do  the Old & New testament the History of the Prophets & Jesus  & the Apostles And I think it time to teach the people the simple  things of the word of God And this message of Good News is  as necessary to this assembly as it was to the people of Judea  we and our children should read the Bible more than we  do at least Our children should read it untill they should   learn whare Jesus Christ was born & understand his  History I wish to come down to the capacity of children  & if they can understand me their Parents can. Perhaps   almost evry child in these vallies at 8 years old know it  is necessary to be baptized at that age because they have  been taught it by their parents or others but many of  them do not know what they are baptized for. But was  it not for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances   & administrations would be in vain & of no Effect, for  if we did not Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ our sins   would not be remitted & if we did not lay on hands in  his name for the Holy Ghost or the Healing of the sick the  candidate would not receive the Holy Ghost nor the sick be Healed  for their is no other name given under Heaven whareby  men can be saved we have no promise of obtaining any  blessing from God except through & in his name. then it is   vary important that we sh& our children should understand   his life & History. some do not know whether He was born  in Asia or America. Jesus Christ told his deciples that He   had other sheep which were not of this fold (those in Jerrusalem)  He came to this continant desended from Heaven & stood  in the midst of a congregation of saints that were assembled  to worship God but He was not born here but He preached   the Gospel here after his death, and holding a three days  meeting in Hell & preaching the gospel to the spirits in prison   while his body lay in the tomb then rising from the tomb   & asscending into heaven then He descended to this contin-  ant in his immortal body & not ownly preached the Gospel   here among the Nephites but chose twelve Apostles Here  & taught many plain simple, Great & glorious things the  whole History of which you can read in the Book of mormon  He told the people He was Jesus Christ who was born in   Jerrusalem & there crusified for the sins of the world. He told them  He had other sheep yet which were not of this Fold neither   at Jerrusalem but were the lost sheep of the House of Israel He  must also go & visit them & when we get the record of of the  Ten lost tribes of Israel we shall get an account of his visit  among them I want to Preach Jesus Christ to you this day     
 Plainness & simplicity for untill you receive the fulness of the gospel  of Christ you arne not a proper candidate either for a fulness of  Celestial Glory or to become sons of Perdition. For those who have  not received a fulness of the Gospel & the Holy Ghost will not always   remain in hell but be redeemed in the own due time of the Lord   & receive some kind of a glory like the stars in comparison to the   son but whare God & Christ & celestial saints dwell they cannot   come worlds without End but those who have partaken of  the fulness of the Gospel & the Holy Ghost & they deny the Lord  & shed innocent Blood or give there consent thereto they  commit the unpardonable sin & there is no forgiveness in   this world nor in the world to come, and I wish you all to   understand that if you are Baptized & receive the Holy Ghost  & your Endowments & are sealed up unto Eternal life against   all manner of sins & blasphemies except the against the sin of  the Holy Ghost that mercy cannot rob Justice that after all   this th if you commit any sin you will have to answer for  it & pay for it in this life & if the sin is great Enough you will   have to be destroyed in the Flesh & if necessary be deliverd over   to the buffitings of satan untill the day of redemption & if your  sins are not unto death you may then come forth & be exhal-  ted to glory Immortality & Eternal life but it is a great  deal better not to sin at all. I want all the children that  are 8 years old & all young persons & all old people & strangers  that have not been baptized to come foreward & be baptized  & also those who have commit sins for which they should   be baptized for that they may begin to be candidats   either for the fulness of Celestial Glory or sons of   perdition. Many other interesting remarks were made  by the speaker but no one reporting they were not taken      At 3 oclock PM. Elder Gilbert Clements addressed the assembly   He took for his text "examine yourselves whether ye be in the   faith or no and said many may think they possess things   which they do not possess & this may be the case with   regard to their faith. do we feel as we once did I think  not at least I can say that many are not as faithful as  they once were I look upon the saints as subject to a comp[le]t[e]  warfare the question was asked anciently shall there  be faith on the Earth when the Lord comes. I know of  No people on Earth that have to make greater exertions  to keep from being worldly minded than this people   for we have been broaken up so many times & driven   from place to place that we have had to labour night  & day in order to live or to obtain the necessaries of life  but in the midst of our labour do we remember our  prayers, do we pray three times a day but says one I  have to go to the canyons to get wood & I have not time   to stop to pray. But I can say I never knew a great  man in the Kingdom of God but what was a praying man  Daniel was a great Prophet & business man yet He alway  found time to pray 3 times a day & he even kept up this practice  when He became prime minister of Babylon & presided over  all the princes & business of that great kingdom what a  glorious example for this people for let us have ever so  much to do we should never neglect our prayers     
 when I see a saint eat & lie down & sleep without praying   I think that man is in the road to ruin. there is sufficient  before our eyes to cause us to pray. I do not think there   ever was a greater miracle than this people coming here  & doing what they have done How has this been accomplished  by the faith of the faithful of this people & the blessings of the  Lord upon us. I have often wondered why so few out of  the thousands who hear the testimony of the servants of God have   received it & again why so few remain faithful to the end   who do receive it. it is because they have lost their faith if   they ever had any. we should not ownly have faith but  works & treasure up evry useful knowledge within our reach   for I do not believe that the spirit of God will go out of his   course to te[a]ch men those things which they are to lazy to  learn when they have the means within their reach. I   know that this people can learn more in 3 months than  other people can in 12. He spoke of schools and the duty  of parents to children He said that the painter & artest presented  their paintings & sculpture which were preserved as the  choice monuments of art & greatness but mothers & teachers   will make an impression upon the mind of youth which   will last long after the painting is worn to threads & the  marble crumbles to dust.      At 7 oclock in the evening the People again assembled at   the school House & were addressed by Elder T. D Brown  addressed the people. He said I am appointed a missionar  but in another part of the vineyard I felt a desire to come  to this place it does not seem but a short time since I began  travelling & preaching. I have thought of the words of Brother Clements  Do we believe in God I have thought much upon this subject  I have spent most of my time for the last two years among the   Indians I have seen much of the dealings of the Lord   among that people & we have been blessed in admin-  istering unto them. I have red of late the History of  Joseph as published by O Pratt the simple testimony  in that work is Good & is calculated to do much good  the instance of his lameness & under the necessity  of having a bone taken from his leg & the doctor  wanted to bind him He said no bind me not I  can endure what is necessary to be done I do not   wish my mother present as it will cause her pain   to see me suffer & I wish to save her all the sorrow  I can this act showed his strong character in the days   of his youth & his Effection for his mother. God has  bestowed great blessings upon this People and I would  Here ask how many there are in this congregation   that are 8 years old who have not been baptized  & there are some parents who do not teach their   children the necessity of it every family should  have in their Library the bible Book of Mormon Doctrin  & Covenants & the Life of Joseph, & we should learn  to practice the preceps of our savior we should  love our Brethren feed the poor cloth the naked

 nor He with his leaders Brother Pratt Also thought that  Adam was made of the dust of the Earth could not believe  that Adam was our God or the Father of Jesus Christ  President Young said that He was that He came from another  world & made this brought Eve with him partook of the  fruits of the Earth begat children & they were Earthly &   & had mortal bodies & if we were Faithful we should  become Gods as He was. He told Brother Pratt to lay aside his  Philosofical reasoning & get revelation from God to Govern  him & Enlighten his mind more & it would be a great   Blessing to him to lay aside his books & go into the canyons as   some of the rest of us was doing & it would be better for him  He said his Phylosophy injured him in a measure many good   things wer said by President Young that we should grow up   in Revelation so that principle would govern evry act of our  lives.

 Him unto the office of the first Patriarch in the church &   Kingdom of God. This blessing was sealed upon him   as it belonged to him by right throug the linage of his   Fathers it was recorded in the Historians office taken   from the report of Thomas Bullock.       At the close of this meeting I returned home & took   most of my family & went to the 14 ward school house   the house was filled to overflowing I went into the stand   with the Bishop I felt as though I was full of fire I   was full of that Electrickt fluid or spirit of God that had   flown through President Young during the day there   was no reporter to record my words, but the following   is a synopsis of my remarks as far as I can recollect      I arose & said I wam thankful for the privilege of meeting   with you & to speak of the things of the Kingdom of God &   to hear from my brethren. I have been full of thought  & reflection this day while sitting & hearing from President   Young, & I feel to thank God with all my heart that He has   bestowed upon us such a leader in this dispensation yes president   Young is a leader in Israel & one that is not ashamed to   rebuke sin in high places He will guard well the interest   & salvation of this People reguardless of all consequences   & I feel it my duty as an Apostles of Jesus Christ & an Elder   in Israel to sustain him in his office & back up ^his testimony^ by my faith   & works & I also consider it the duty of evry Apostle   Bishop, Elder, & officer & member in the Church of Jesus   Christ to do the same if we are not willing to do it we are   not worthy of the place we occupy. & when we know that   sin wickedness & improper conduct exhist in any of our   wards we should rebuke that evil & correct it in our own  houses & wards & not leave it all for President Young to do. we   have Evils in our own ward we have wicked men who will   blaspheme the name of God & who are striving to destroy our   wives & daughters. I have seen some of those same men   come here to meeting & set & laugh me in the face all the   while I was speaking & they will set & laugh the   Bishop in the face while he is speaking this class of   young men some of them are members of the church yet   they will join with the wicked & come here to meeting &   take a seat in the back part of the house & get together in   a group & gather all the young women & girls around them   they can & then conduct in a rediculous manner instead of   paying attention to the preaching. that class of men should   stay at home for while they conduct as they do I would   rather have their room than their company. they are also   useing evry exhertion to draw away our young women & girls to   parties & would destroy them if they could. shall we sleep   unconcerned as Elders & parents while these scenes are enacted   around us no I will not do it & I feel to exhort this con-  gregation to wake up & know what is going on around them   & their families & not suffer your wives & daughters to   mingle with Military officers soldiers, Horslers & cooks & gentils   in balls parties rides & other amusements untill they are defiled     
 & destroyed it its much easier to keep your hands out of the   fire than to cure them after they are burned. I would   far prefer to bury any wife or child I have than to   have them live to dishonor my name & disgrace themselves   by commiting sin with the gentiles. If the Bishop sees   any member of my family children or wives come here  to meeting & take a seat in the back part of the House &   spend the time in play instead of attending to the preaching   I wish him to call them by name & let them be reproved   openly if they will take that course for they all know that   that to be against my council & I wish the Bishop would   pursue that course with all persons who come here & do not   do right. we should not be ashamed or afraid to rebuke   wickedness sin & abominations whence ever we know of their its   existance in our midst. for by doing right we will ever be supported   by the right hand of the Lord. there is not the least trembling   in my boydy or spirit because of the results that myay arise from   resisting & rebuking sin for I would rather die wifeless &   childless & see my dwellings laid in ruins & my own body fall   in the gap than to permit whordoms, wickedness & abominations   to exhist in our families wards & cities unrebuked & unchecked   for we as a people have to sanctify ourselves before the Lord  in order to sanctify have the blessings & approbation of the   Lord upon us. It will be far better for us to restrain our   children from Evil than to suffer them to go headlong to ruin   & they will thank God to all Eternity that there parents have   given them good council & restrained them from Evil rather   than to be permitted to plunge into misery sin sorrow & woe   we should treat our wives & children with kindness &   affection & give them good council & when we have done all we   can for them then if they will do ^w^rong & go to ruin our gar-  ments are clear & I hope from this time forth that we   may not look upon sin with any degree of allowance of   approbation which may God grant for Christ Amen      I was followed in my remarks by Bishop Hoagland Phineas   Richards Joseph Horn & Samuel Richards all backed up my   testimony. the spirit of the Lord rested upon us & we had   a good time      February 19, 1855 ~ Monday      19th I spent a part of the day in the Historians office & the   evening in the Grammar school.

President Young  Addressed the People I was not in at the comm[encem]ent   & had no chance of reporting his discourse the following   is a key to his address which I have to write from memory      I do not wish to spend my time neither is it profit[ably]  for any man to spend his time in telling the people  what was done in the days of Adam, Enoch & Noah  thousands of years ago or what will be done in  the malinum thousands of years hence but my business  is to tell the people what they should do to day in order  to be saved this is my doctrin all the time. What  can I do or this people do this day in any one thing in  order to help build up the kingdom of God or to advance  one step further towards ^the^ salvation of ourselves or our  brethren. Now what has been the counsel to this people   throughout this Territory for several years it has  been to Fort up, to wall in your cities with strong  walls, this has been the voice of the Lord unto them  all the day long have the people listened to this voice  have they carried out this counsel No they have not  but what have they done. they have been ready  to say what need hath the Lord of this thing, do you  think there is any danger of the Indians. do you think  that Brother Brigham really believes that it is necessary  to go to so much expens in building walls around our  cities. Instead of going to work & doing what they are   told to do the people spend their time in talking about  it & trying to evade it.      Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed   me to lead this people the people has chosen me as their  leader & covenanted to sustain me & obey my counsel  Now if I tell the people what to do & they do not do  it nor carry out my counsel, but turn from it  & go to work & do sumthing els & they continue this   year after year while at the same time I am  warning them of the danger of their Course     
 & telling them of the Judgments that will   come upon them if they do not alter their   cours & go to work & do as I have told told the[m]   do you suppose they will escape the chastening   rod of the Almighty No they will not if the   people continue to persue this course & the   chastening rod does not fall upon their heads   I should become disgraced in the sight of God   Angels & men. this people may rest assured that  they are preparing a rod for their backs if they  do not listen to my counsel & do what I tell  them. but says one I would go to work &  help build a wall around the City if I knew   it was a revelation from God & that it was   his will that we should do it. I want to say to   such that it is my will that you should do it  & that is enough I am responsible for it & if  you want to know any further about it do  right pray unto the Lord & have faith before  him that you may have visions & revelations   from God tso that you may understand the   truth & know what lies before us as I do, then  you will not question the reasonableness of these  things but go to work & do them with all your might  My teaching is to tell the people what to do to be saved to  day for if you get out of the path of salvation today  you are in danger of being out of it tomorrow &   the further you stray from it the more difficulty  you will meet with in ever finding it again. it would   be folly in me to spend my time in telling the people  about the glories of the Millennium while I see them   straying from those paths that would lead to those glories  now many of this people will say I have fine farms, Horses, Cattle  goods gold & riches the possesser says I look upon them I say  thes are mine & at the same time you do not once even think   that there is not one thing in your possession that is youres that  it all belongs to God & even you yourself belongs to God & all you  have belongs to Him & He has ownly loaned it to you & yet   you do not acknowlede his hand in any thing while you should  acknowledge his hand in all things.      I know what the design   of the Lord is in leading this people to this place & his design   concerning Israel and it is none of your business what I coun-  sel you to do it is your business to go to work & do it. leave the  event with God I want this people to build their forts as I   tell them & when you have built this fort & made a wall  6 feet thick & 12 feet high & get comfortable in your houses then   go to work & build one on the outside of it 12 feet thick & run  them both up together 25 feet high & keep building untill   I tell you to stop. & be in a situation that you may shut up   your gates & lie down & sleep in safety with your wives & childr[e]n  many other interesting remarks were made by President Young  upon this occasion which I am not able to record     
 May 5, 1854 ~ Friday      May 5th Friday we left Union fort rode to dry creek settle[men]t  made a short halt then drove to the American fork. 25 miles  & spent the night the ^people^ Assembled for a meeting I was called  upon to address the people the following is a key to the remarks  which I made. I said to the people that I should confine my  remarks to those things that immediately consern us you have  [been] counselled to build forths & wall in your cities with strong   walls for several years throughout this Territory but the people  have not done it the[y] have vary slow to harken to the   counsel of the servants of God from the begining even in the  days of Joseph all the people were ready to acknowledge   he was a profit & looked to him to receive salvations  at his hands & was ready to have him controll them in all  matters appertaining to what the people termed spiritual  things but if He wanted $100 dollars in money He would have   to Employ all the Twelve & mortgage his farm in order to  get it the traditions of the people were so strong that they   could not bear the Idea of having a Prophet dictate their tem-  poral affairs but I wish to ask a question which is the  most important to you A part in the first resurrection in   exaltation & glory in the Celestial Kingdom of God with all  its attendant blessings or a few Horses Cattle gold & goods Judge  ye then why should it be thought a thing incredible or unjst  unjust for a profit of God who is called to guide & controll us in  all the weighty matters that consern us should also counsel us   in those lesser matters of every day life now go to & build  your wall around your city as you have been commanded to do   & the blessings of God will rest upon you but if you refuse   to follow the counsel given there is a rod preparing for you   & it will be but a short time before you will see the hand  of God visible in the counsel that has been given to this people  in building strong walls around these Cities many other  remarks was made but not here recorded      President Kimball followed & said that what Brother  Woodruff had said was true his words are true. President   Young comes here to visit the people & tell them what He wants  done He has sent men to you also to tell you what to do & that   is the same as though he had been with you himself you have  got to follow his counsel. And you have to fulfill your covenants   which you made at the waters of Baptism we must not forget   God. He intends we shall do that which we ought to do when  God tels us to do any thing we should go to work & do it willingly  I am telling what is our duty. many often want to Jump  over under officers so as to get to President Young I have  lived in the days of Joseph & in the days of President Young & I   have always obayed those men for they were placed over me  to obey them it is the duty of this people to obey their lead-  ers it is the duty of my family to obey me I have no misteries  to give you for I have none but my business is to teach you  the truth well you are told to make a wall around your City  and you have it to do. you read in the Book of mormon that  the people had to wall in their cities in ancient days we have it   to do in our day you have to become one or you are not the Lords     
 you are a good people but their is great room for imp-  rovement in this city. the last one that we visited.  I would like to see this people in good houses & gardens   & in good forts.      now when you come to the conference   you all vote to sustain President Young now you have got   to honour this man he holds the [FIGURE] of the Kingdom of God   and sustain him or the Lord will not save & exhalt  you in his kingdom. I pray that you may do right & serve   the Lord I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ Amen      President Young arose and said I am willing to say a few  words. If the Latter Day Saints cannot become one hart &   mind & work in their temporal things which they do  understand they cannot become one in Eternal things which  they cannot understand. If you would too [do] as you are told then   all would be right when the Lord requires any thing   at your hands dont ask any questions but go to & do as  you are counselled to do you may ask is their any danger  of the Indians you do not always know what danger you  are in but always do as you are told & then you are   safe      May 6, 1854 ~ Saturday      Saturday 6th Rode to ^Battle Creek 3 mils^ provo 12 mils spent the  Sabbath and held a meeting with the people  Sunda President Young arose & said that I am   not in the habit of taking a text but I will now take  for my text the last line that was sung "God is his   own interpetor" He will make all things plain but do the  people understand those things which are for our good  the Lord will not explain all things unto us whe under  stands but he will make his people walk by faith He   will not explain all his mistaries to the people. we read in the   New Testament that faith is the assurance of things hoped   for & the evidence of things not seen have we all got   faith it is our duty to have faith in God & his word & promises  you have to trust in God. He will not reveal all things u[n]to   us some men are tried will the counsel given & will   not obey they will not have glory in the kingdom of  God they are bastards & not sons the Lord intends  for the people to be tried so as to prove the faithful  What God does reveal He reveals for the purpose of  leading men in the way of salvation the people do not  know the way of the Lord they come here and  say I am going to build myself up I have to work so hard  I cannot get time to pray but are you doing right when   you do this we may labour to get all things abot us yet  the Lord will controll it as seemath him good. If you  get into the dark still hold on to the work of God no matter  if I dont fell like praying I will do it if the Lord should  open the visions of the minds of the people that have gone   to Calafornia so that they could see things as they are they  would as soon cut their throats as to have done it but they   dont see it they have to go and suffer untill they are  satisfied I will say the same to this people if we do not     
 do the things which god requires of us we shall be whiped till we   are sore this is the ownly thing that will save us I now  tell you that those that are gone & going to Calafornia without  counsel will ketch it till they are sore I know the truth but I cann-  ot tell it all to you untill God permits me to do it now if you have  not confidence in me to follow me & believe that I am doing right   drop me and appoint another & I will follow in the wake.      In the begining of this work God tried to get this people to be  one but they would not be one. I will now tell you what to do  God intends to make you one you must be one & their must be a   begining to this and you must begin in small things like childr[en]  making Cob Houses the people went to Missouri & there they   quarrelled about many small matters then God said I will throw   dow[n] their good houses & God d^D^roved all the people out & they thought  they were knocked into pi[eces] [ink change] did they do any better then, no they did not,  God tries the people both in riches & with poverty. if I will be faithful in my poverty I will  own all riches that is needful. now if God wants us to be of one heart & one mind. now he  may have no ^other^ motive in view than to make us work together he will tell us to build fences &  forts that our feelings & interest may be united in something. now will you do it? we are required  to become of one heart & mind & work together in those little things that we do understand  or else we could not be prepared to work together and be one in those eternal things which we  do not understand therefore we could not enter into the kingdom of God. it is nothing but the  power of God that has preserved this settlement. the Indians could have killed every man  woman & child here, & not a man had a gun ready to defend himself. when you have  become of one heart & mind he has treasures for you & has given us capacity to see if we  will magnify our calling with every thing we have to do in our lives. we are approaching  very swiftly the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart & mind which the  Prophet Joseph said would be in this generation & will manifest himself to the Saints & take  up his abode with him. this was said 24 years ago & in 26 years more if we r not prepared  to meet Jesus & angels we shall be wiped out & sent to hell. we r fast approaching the time  I do not care what was done in the morning of creation or the days of Noah. I want to know  what this people will do. will you be Saints & live your religion & magnify your callings in the Church  I will now tell this people what they should do. I will tell the Bishop in the presence of the people  what to do. Bishop I tell you, go & start this wall & build it 6 feet thick & 12 or 14 feet high  shut up every gate except two & then you can lay down in safety & an enemy cannot come  upon you. if this is not the will of the Lord I do know it is my will & you should not question any   further. God wants it done & I want it done & dont stop until you are secured & that is enough  your stacks have been so placed that one Indian could fire all this place & others shoot you down  while you are fighting the fire. what if the people in Jackson Co had been good & been sanctified   what would have been the situation of the people. why, the liars & goats would have had their heads  cut off but the wheat & tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. it was not the act   of Joseph that caused the removal of this people. it is the people that govern & control which is the  democracy of heaven. the democracy of earth is division and mark it, there will be a division  here before long among this people. now if you will all do right & live a holy life angels will come  & visit us & sta[y] with us all night & you will have many revelations & be happy. we know we ought  to pra[y] & would not neglect it, if we loved the Lord. you may do just as you have a mind to  when I am gone but I beg & beseech of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall & be   safe so that whatever comes along you may be secure & bar your gates & be careful & dont let the  devil reign in you & all will be right & God bless you & I bless you. let us be ^of^ one heart & mind  in the things that we do comprehend & then we shall be one in things we shall hereafter know.      President H C Kimball it is not my place [ink change] to get up to reveal any thing for it is the head to convey  it to the body. but it is for me to carry out his designs & do his will for when I do the will of   President Young I do the will of God & no man can get salvation unless he keeps his council      it is his will that the City should be walled & fortified & that is my will, when I do just     
 as he tells me I do the will of my Father in Heaven for he is the only man that holds  the keys of salvation. when I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad & so do you all. when  I do his will I can sleep in peace & my heart is consoled all the day long. this is also  the case with you when you do not do as your Bishop tells you. last year your improvements  were all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed suckertash pie. now go to &  save yourselves against all selfishness. I am going to put my property & all my wives  into the Church & then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going to dedicate all   I have to God. when a man turns away from the Priesthood he forfeits every thing  even his life for that is no longer his. my body is only lent to me by the Lord   and I forfeit every thing when I go astray. if righteousness was laid to the line   it would take many heads from their shoulders & the day will be when that will be done      [ink change] now do as your bishop tells you & not go to salt   Lake to President Young to alter this or that I  pray that this people may do right for when you dishon[o]r  the priesthood you dishonor God I have been told   that some have said that I will honor the priesthood   but I will not honor him that holds the priesthood  but I say that you cannot honor one without honoring  the other. Bishop Walker is presiding here follow  his council & all will be right and the blessing of   God will rest upon you even so Amen      Benediction by W Woodruff      we rode to Provo & spent the night      May 7, 1854 ~ Sunday      Sunday May 7th The people assembled in the meeting  house in two rooms.

 WILLFORD WOODRUFFS  JOURNAL   FOR   1854     
 January 1, 1854 ~ Sunday      JAN 1st 1854. Sunday I attended meeting at  the Tabernacle the people were addressed in an inter-  esting & ediyfying manner in the morning By Elder  Orson Hyde. In the afternoon by Elder Wilford Woodruff   & Followed By Preseident Brigham Young. He spoke as He always   does much to the edifycation of the People      January 2, 1854 ~ Monday      2nd ^[FIGURE]^ I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the 14th  ward ^at the^ school House was followed by several others   in the fore part of the day I attended a party in   the evening at the Social Hall time was mostly spent  in music & danceing we had However an interesting  address from President Young on the subject of danceing  He said I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction.    we have assembled here to have music & danceing  the world have had vary strange Ideas concerning these things  they have supposed it was a vary wicked thing for a Christ[ian]  to dance or hear music many preachers of the day have  said that fidling & music hCame from Hell But I say that  their is no fiddleing or music in hell their is not a fiddler in  hell or any music of any kind music belongs in heaven  to cheer God, Angel, & man, if we could hear the music   their is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man the  Lord gave us that organ that makes music so delightful to  man & the Devel has stolen musick & many other things  that was ordained of God for the Benefit of man & has  turned it to an evil use but music & danceing is for the benef[it]  of the Holy ones & if those that come here to night are  not Holy & righteous & feel to worship & Praise God they   have no business here what strange Idea the world has  of a prophet they would expect to see a man with finger  na^i^les a foot long with his hair hanging to his hips, with  his body covered with dirt & filth with his head bowed  down in sorrow for the sins of the world that He would not   have a house or lie in one, or in a bed, but lie in the caves of  the rocks & on the Ground & must never smile or appear  happy. And as to seeing an Apostles the people would   expect to melt if one came along. But all of these  Ideas are vain & foolish for this company before me  to night does not begin to be adorned inside or out as  they should be in order to meet with the Angels in heaven who  are adorned in purity power & Glory clothed with clean  white linen. I will say a word concerning danceing with the  Gentiles. As I have got up this party If I had felt disposed  to have invited some Gentiles here would they have  contaminated me or this company No because the  priesthood rules here with the keys of power truth light  & knowledge. And I would not suffer any thing that  is rong for I would controlls things & have them my   own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in this  church was to follow after Gentile parties they would  submit themselves to their spirit partake of their evils  & go to the devel any Elder would fall that persued this  course     
 why do not the Gentile merchants of this City embraced  this work because they have locked b[o]arded & bolted  their minds against it with evry lock they could  put on. They swore by evry power they possess before  they left home they would not embrace it they came  with but one object & that was to gain money & they  are determined not to be turned from their purpose  many good remarks were made by the president  I tarried at the party untill 12 oclok & then returned  home      January 3, 1854 ~ Tuesday      3rd I spent the fore part of the day at home writing      January 4, 1854 ~ Wednesday to January 7, 1854 ~ Saturday      4th to 7th I spent the time at the Legislature      January 8, 1854 ~ Sunday      8th Sunday I attended a meeting Lorenzo^in^ Far preached  I reported his sermon      January 9, 1854 ~ Monday to January 14, 1854 ~ Saturday      9th to 14 I spent this week in the Legislatur the mail  came in this week I received a Letter from  Sister William Benbow & a paper from O.  Pratt      January 15, 1854 ~ Sunday      15th Sunday we have 8 inches of snow on the ground  this morning I spent the day at home.      January 16, 1854 ~ Monday to January 20, 1854 ~ Friday      16 to 20th I spent this week in the Legislature which closed  on this 20 day of Jan 1854      January 21, 1854 ~ Saturday      21st I commenced a school this morning in my family   with my own children      January 22, 1854 ~ Sunday      22nd ^[FIGURE]^ I attended meeting at the Tabernacle & I preached  in the morning to the saints from the following words  "whatsoever ye sow that shall you reap" I told the people  that if they sowed good principles in their own minds  & in the minds of their children that they will bring  forth good fruit which will tend to exhaltation & glory   so can we judge of the nations of the Earth if they indulge  in sin wickedness & abominations & their Children are  brought up in the same they must expect to reap the   whirlwind arrow & death, Judgment sorrow wo &  destruction. We should warn our children of all   danger & escape all sin ourselves we were here in   these vallies through the mercies of God & we should   make an improvement by our situation      President Young Preached in the Afternoon And I reported  his sermon At the close of the meeting I went in company   [FIGURE] with President Young to see President Willard Richards  who was vary sick with the palsy he was in an awful   spasm lying upon the floor with sever[al] men trying to hold  him he suffered immensly it seemed as though he was  strugling in the agonies of death He had been sick several  days I spent the night with him. He suffered much during  the night the presidency & Twelve administered to him by the     
 laying on of hands & prayer we were almost fearfu[l]  that He would not recover from this sickness still  we had hope      January 23, 1854 ~ Monday      23rd I left President Richards this morning and  returned to my house & spent the day at home      January 24, 1854 ~ Tuesday      24th I spent the day at home with my children &  in the evening I delivered a lecture upon the subject of   education in the school house of the 19th ward school  house      January 25, 1854 ~ Wednesday      25 I spent the day at home with my children      January 26, 1854 ~ Thursday to January 28, 1854 ~ Saturday      26th 27 & 28 I spent the time at home in school with my  children Dr Richards is still failing & suffering much      January 29, 1854 ~ Sunday      29th Sunday I attended with Dr Richards in the fore   part of the day He suffered much O Hyde preached  in the fore part of the day and P. P. Pratt in the afternoon  at the close of the meeting the Presidency & Twelve went  to Dr Richards and Administered to him by the laying  on of hands and we have done it freequently & at  times had a testimony by the spirit of God that He would  get better but all outward appearances have been against  his getting up again. I met in the 14th ward school  house at candle light & Preached to a full house was  followed by P P Pratt we had a good time the spirit of  the Lord was poured out upon us at the close of the  meeting the spirit I went to Dr Richards & spent 2  hours. He was vary low & it appeared as though He  would not live till morning      January 30, 1854 ~ Monday      30th Dr Richards is alive this morning and appears  some better I wrote 2 letters to I F Carters & J M Bern-  [FIGURE] hisel I spent the remainder of the day at home      January 31, 1854 ~ Tuesday      31st Dr Richards still lives and appears some better  And I pray the Lord he may again get well for many  reasons one is the Twelve have administered to him  many times and felt moved upon at times to promis  him that he should live and get well and stand in the  midst of his brethren and also to administer to his  family this I promised him once while the Twelve and  all his wives were administering to him at the same  time. I attended the Bishops meeting this evening  with Elder Thomas Kington I addressed the Bishops  and had the spirit of the Lord we are now begining  to ordain our young Sons to the lesser ^priesthood^ here in Zion      February 1, 1854 ~ Wednesday      Feb 1st we are now gathering all our young Children  from eight years old and upward in the several wards  one evening in each week for the purpose of speaking  and praying I met with the children in the 14 ward this   evening and addressed them & herd some 50 of them  speak and it was an interesting time
