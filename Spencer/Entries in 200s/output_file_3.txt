 all be restored again.— Paul says I die da^i^ly brother Joseph says that he actually died and was raised to life again— says the beasts that he fought with at Epesus often killed him and he came to life again— if so Willford why may not our little Sarah be raised to life again— He, brother Joseph has brought forth many new things this season.— There has been quite a number of deaths in Commerce the past season I believed that I mentioned some of them in my last letter to you Seymour Brunson, he was buried under armes— bishop he said that brother D. Patten was calling him and desired brother Joseph to let him go for he needed him— likewise bishop Partridge is dead and his wife is married again to father Huntingdon who lost his wife last fall – Mother Beanam— father John Jo Joseph Smith the patriarch a little previous to his death he called his children around him and blessed them and appointed Hiram Patriarch in his stead— There are many things I have mentioned in my other letters to you which would be interesting to you which I could mention if you have not received them. such as some of the brethren's going among the Indians, I saw two of them on the 2nd of this month and they said the prospects were good - last April there was an Indian his wife and daughter baptized in Commerce.— I have not heard from Main or Connecticut since I wrote you last. - Did you know that brother Ilus in N. Y. was married— Brother Dwite Webster came here in june and went to the south with brother Smoot & expects to spend the winter in Ten. brother Smoot has ordained him an elder and given him charge over the churches there, he makes great proficiency in the ministry— brother Smoot has got home and with his wife sends his respects to you Sister Smoot says to tell brother Woodruff not to forget my hymn book and while you are thinking of hers remember that I have no hymn book or bible.Brother John Herrett has been walking in your steps even on the fox islands with some other elders and there has been quite a stir among the people there again and there has about as many come into the church lately us when you was there— sister Jane Herrett say give my respects to br Woodruff I have lately had a letter from her— I have lately seen sister Bently she that ^was^ sister Pattin she says give my love to brother Woodruff and tell him he knows that I love him with all my hart, her health is poor and she desires the prayrs of all that quorum that it may not turn with her as it did with brother Pratts first wife in her last day but that she may be spared through it and do good on the earthshe wants that little portrait of brother Pattins which you have as she has n[one]I [page torn] you to get your portrait painted if you can conveniently— a[page torn]if you [page torn] [ca]n get me a wrought black lace veil I should like it much and [page torn]cape and collar I should be much pleased as they come much cheaper the[page torn] here. The families of the 12 have rather snug times to get along here— brother Kimball was a wise man to build his house and get his family into it before he left them. I have seen sister Moon sister Sutton and another sister from Eng I have forgotten her name they were from Preston they have seen you all. I was glad to see them. I read some of your letters to them they were much pleased with them. Please give my respects to brother Kimbal and all the quorum that are there likewise all the saints around you.19th Yesterday Sunday, we had an interesting sermon we had an interestingsubjec upon the living's being baptized for the dead it was made so plain that none could dispute it reasonably and I should be glad to be baptized for my grandparents and some others but want to wait for you to do it would it not be best, I had rather you would do it than any person living.— Sister Swasey one of my good neighbours sends her respects to you and says tell brother Woodruff that she wants him to come home for my sake. I am now at father Clarks and think I shall stay here untill you come home. I am comfortable here and if I want any thing can call on brother William Clark who wrote to you in my other letter makeing a covenant with you that he would supply my needs and wants untill you come home, He is a fine young man— belongs to the 70s and is father Clarks oldest son at home he know you and says he is some acquainted with you— therefore give yourselfe no uneasiness about my temporal wants but give me and our babe an interest in your prayrs. I fell anxious to see my presents you spoke of in your last letter— Ah! what shall I do when those little shoes come for Sarah I don't know sometimes how to bear her loss it seames as though I cannot endure it, but I must stop for it seems line a neverending subject for me to speak or write on. Sister Young and Kimbal received some very pretty presents I saw them when I was there they (like me) thought much of them; more on account of their comeing from their husbands – If you could get some articles of clothing for your family it would be quite acceptable— the sister who gave you the bed in N. Y.apostatized in about 2 weeks after so sister Stone told me from N. Y. Sarah Milliken is not married yet but expects to be to a man out of the Church she is in Commerce.— Aphia Woodman has sent a letter to Sarah Milliken asking her advice and mine about coming west with Milton she is about 60 miles east of father Carters with her brother - Milton has lately sent here to know who of the brethren are going to Eng. this fall and when they will be in N.Y. so it appears that he is thinking of going but there are none who are thinking of going from here this fall, I hear that brother Joseph dont think it is best for them to go.

 Sept 19th 1839Lovely-street as you named the place when hereDear WillfordAfter waightining waiting 5 long weeks after you left me tohear from you I take my pen although in a feeble state and on the bedas you will perceive from my writing. I let Sarah stay at brother Smoots8 days after you left then she came home well and fleshy and bright she continued wellabout 2 weeks and then I was taken with the fever and ague 3 or 4 days before she was.we were then in Montrose and no one to do any thing for us as they were all sickabout there so that brother and sister Smoot came out and mooved us to theirhouse and rendered us every assistanc they could although their house wasunfinished yet our accommodations were much better than in Montrose.we have been quite low having had a shake every day but are both getting better now. I was much rejoiced to hear of the improvement of yourhealth after you left by a man who saw ^you^ about 40 miles from here who saidthat you requested him to call and see me. I was glad to hear from you anyway. much wonder that you do not write as you have always done beforeI think that you have not time or the letter has miscaried or something hashappened. so good night my Willford hopeing that I shall feel betterin the morn. The morn has come and found me for the first timewithout a chill or shake although I feal verry weak yet I think thatI am gaining health and Sarah to. The men have come to day to raise myhouse I am in hopes that they will get it finished by the time that I amable to go into it their has been some talk of sister Tailor's going in withme as she had to move out of brother Youngs house she went into my roomwith sister Pratt while I am out here. Sister Taylor wants to comeout into this neighbourhood she is a good neighbour. but the family youleft with me Oh! dear! if I had expected the time had been long that I should have dwealt there I should have sent for you to have come homefor I could not have staid in the house with any contentment— butthank the Lord I have not for the frirst moment wished you at homesince you left but desired and prayed for your spead and success onyour mission, Yea that you might have strength both temporal and spiritual wisdom grace knowledge humility and understanding to preserve you from all evil and help you fill your mission in the loveand fear of God and have many souls as seals of your ministryI hope to do better next time 
 Yes I even begin to look forth for the day when I hope and trust that Ishall behold and embrace him whom I now feal to dedicate to the Lord knowing his calling although it I think it the greatest sacrafice that I couldmake to be deprived of the society and company of my nearest friend on earthbut I think that the grace of God is sufficient for all things even to raiseme from a bed of sickness and preserve me ^and Sarah^ untill thy return which ismy sincere desire. Oh! Willford do not forget ^us^ when at the throne of gracefor we need as much grace to stand at this time of trial there are notenough well people in Montrose to take care of the sick thereforethey suffer for want of attention—much the same in Commercealthough some have died there—and none in Montrose save anumber of children brother Pratts was one of the number— wellwhen you left. There have about 53 of the brethren died in Quincyand it continues verry sickly there yet— brother Lane has lost bothof his children. brother Warren Smiths wife is dead some of yourSouthern acquaintance—brother Jeremiah Murphy has been here fromTennessee and wishes to be rem^e^mbered to you. I suppose that youhave learned the fate of our Island friends as I heared that you wentthrough Rochester was glad that you had an oppertunity of seeingthem. I received a book of brother Taylor's writing from Springfieldwith your marke or my name on it. was glad even to see thatI received a letter from home the day that you left home. the^i^r heathwas generally good accept sister Foss who was quite feeble and had beenfor 2 months in consequence of lifting the old gentleman who lived with herin his last illness he died last April. they sent much love to you andthe letter was d^i^rected to you. they much wished you ^to^ called and seebrother Ilus in N.Y. they feared that you would not know that he wasthere. did not know that we had a paper from him. they wanted meto come home and stay with them while you was gone. they wantedyou to call there on your return from England— Sister Foss would bemuch pleased with a letter from you. do write me once a month forthey will seam long. I found the last page in your journal and readit with interest. hope that you found a lock of my hair with some linesin your trunk. Sarah sends a lock of her hair to you with a kiss by kissingthe letter. Shshe often calls pa-pa-pa- verry loud—dont you hear her. Ifyou have an oppertunity to get some wooling undershirts they would be muchbetter for you. I have been weighting to receive a a letter from you before I wrotebut feared if I weighted longer you would not get it before you left N.Y. 
 I verry much covet the long time that you have to journey before you get toN.Y. wish you could have spent the time at home. I would have written youa few of my sick bed reflections but do not feal able.

 Lee Montrose Lee County Iowa Territory Sept 8th 1840My Dear Willford,With pleasure I seat myself at this time to acknowledge the reception of your kind letter which came to hand 10 days sinceand I should have answered it immedately after its reception had it not been that mybabe was quite sick but he is better now I had been an[x]iously looking for a letter from you for a long time and to my greate satisfaction received it from the hand of a brother, brought by some of the brethren from Eng. on the 27th of Aug. 4 families arrived in Commerce fromEng. and report says that 30 families more stopped in Cincinata Ohio for a little seasonto labour and obtain more means to bring them here. I was truly glad that you received that letter you spoke of that I sent you in march for I conclude you must feell verryan^x^ious to hear from home judging you by myselfe for if I do not get a letter from you often I get quite uneasey — this is the 7th letter I have sent you since you left N N.Y. I havetaken much pains to write you since you left home and much lament that you have not received my letters, for I have written them verry full and one was a long sheet like yourmamoth sheet-filled full, I wrote you once in Jan. then in Mar. then in Apr. then in May then June then July then this in Sept — the April letter I sent by brother O. Hyde and J. E. Page, who who started soon after the April conference on a mission to the ^Jews^ viaof Eng and the one in july I sent by brother L. Snow containing an acount of SarahEmma death he expected to go d^i^rect to Eng. and I hope you have received that one thistime, one I directed to you in Liverpool in the care of J. Taylor thinking you would be more likely to get it. You say you have sent me 4 letters since you arrived in Eng. I have received them all and they brought much news, and afforded me and others muchsatisfaction for all the brethren and sisters seam anxious to hear from Eng. and Iwith them rejoice with you much in the prosperity of the work with you and that the Lord is blessing you labours and the brethren's there - The work rolls on there swiftly but the time of your absence seames long to me it is 13 months today since I last saw you and it seames to me to be almost an age but I will try to wait patiently your return which I know will be as soon as the Lord^'s will^ is done with you there and did I not know that the Lord required you to be in his vineyard I could not endure your absence but the Lord has promised strength equal to our day and I find he has fulfilled that promis to me, for I have been enabled the most of the timeto be contented and reconciled to my situation although I have had much sickness and a severe trial to pass through in looseing my little Sarah even in the absence of her father the little dear had no relatives to follow her to her grave but her mother and little brother whome shetenderly loved, she d there was quite a number of the brethren and sisters accompanyed me butit was a peculiar trying scene for me, more so because of your absence she did not forget her pa,pa, for she used to call him many times in a day, but I trust she rests from the toils and troubles of this life. I have not heard from father Carter or father Woodruffs household for sometime, but lately learned by a letter from br. D. Webster that Eunice had late ly received a letter from you and that she had been unwell but was better, the others were well br. Webster went to the south in june in company with br. Smoot as far as Tennessee he makes good progress in the work and is pleased with his calling br he thinks of spending the winter in the south if so he will be ordained an eld. and have charge over the churches there, thus writes br. Smoot to his wife and says he and br W. has baptized 15 he (Smoot) is soon expected home and will bring his mother in law McMeanes with him he and his wife send their respects to you likewise br Albert Smith and rejoices in the progress of the work with you also br. S. Smith and wife. Br. D. Webster spent a week with me in june I suppose you knowof the engagement between him and sister E. Woodruff he told me of it himselfe whenhe was here. I think him to be a fine man and will make a worthy companion he wrote some in a letter that I was writing to you when he was here.The siskness in Montrose and Commerce is not so greate as it was last seasonbut there has quite a number died this season some of which I know Seymour Brunson, widow Beman, J. Holme's wife, J.P. Green's wife, Bishop Partridge, and daughter,S. Rigdon and father Joseph Smith are verry low, and many others that I do notknow I had our little Sarah buried in Commerc and have got a picket fence aroundit ^her grave^ painted white and trimed with black — I miss her company much. If youhave not received my letters there are many things that contained in them youwould like to hear our family matters &c. In my Jan letter I told you about my temporal affairs and situation and I have just written you a letter which Ishall not send you but shall keep it for you when you come home come home those are pleaseing words shall I ever realize them I hope to. I am now at father Clark's where I have been since last Dec. they are verry kind to me and have been ever since I have been there he makes me welcome to stay here untill you come home there is a branch of the church here of about 50 and they are well united Ephraim Luce belongs to it and family N. Thoma's and family they wish to be remembered to you.

I have seen brother William Benbow from Eng. where you made it your home for 2 months when they were there and the little girls that usedto sleep with you, or the man of God as they called you, they were as much pleased to see me asthough we had always been acquainted I had a verry pleaseing visit with them they 
 seem much pleased with their situation they appear to be worthy people I think mumuch of them perhapse more for haveing been acquainted with you, he said you toldhim you thought you should see him in Amrica in about one year from that time which was last April I count the time verry particularly up to that timeO my dear W. must I wait longer than that time to see you, br. Joseph says that the Lord doesnot require a man to be from his family more than a year at one time. brother O. H Hyde and J.E. Page have started on a mission to the Jews have been gone about 5 months and have not got near N.Y. yet they are going to Eng. and then to constantinople, - if you do not get the times and seasons I would just say that thereis verry interesting letter in it from the Jews, it is lengthy and you would be highly edefied to have a perusal of the whole of it but I can only give you some items from it, They say the Lord has oppened the way where by they might get possession of their beloved citty and they lost no time but exerted themselves to rebuild their beloved citty and the undertakeing prospered in their hands so that they have completedthe Medrash and greate is the glory of the house and also of the houses of the teachersof the law and they have authorized one Aaron Selig Ashkenazi to go forth with a proclamation to all their brethren soliciting them to come and assist them they seam greately rejoiced at their present prospects. There has been an Indian his wifeand daughter baptize in Commerce last April they were much pleased with the bookof mormon and said every word of it was true he was an interpreter for 6 tribes he said that his brethren would receive the work every one of them they come 6 or 7 hundred miles to be acquainted with it. Brother Joseph has been dilivering a course of lectures of late upon the eternal judgment the eternity of matter &c &c I often thought how interesting they would have been to you as well as others he made it so plain that a child could understand it — the work is progressing in every part of Americabut not as fast as in Eng. I showed your letters to brother Joseph there was quite a number present he to^ld^ them to give audience while the last one was red as I had shown him the others before they all gave attention and was much pleased withthe contents none more so than Joseph he wants me to let him see your letters whichI have done he says he would not leave his family so but would take them with himif he took them on his back — The church began to build a house on the other side of the river ^for us^ but they do not think of finishing it this fall sister Young has moved into her house on that side but it is not quite finished the body of ours is up to the roof and thereit stands sister Taylor's is not finished sister Pratt had one bought for her — brother G.A. Smiths father lives in our house in Lovely street I did think of moveing there this fall but expect now to stay where I am now untill you return as father Clark has made me welcome he says tell br. Woodruff I that he will take as good care of me as he can and he wants you to get as many souls as he can sends his respects likewise, — we have had a wedding in the family her[e] of late that sister Church that I mentioned in my March letter has lately been married to one of father Clark's sons John Wesly the[y] send their respects to you likewise all the family.

Woodruff P.W. WoodruffYou sell tell me to kiss the children for you that I did verry often before little Sarah died and she used to kiss me many time for pa,pa, as she called you and a little before the breath left her body she kissed me for you and little Willo as she called him I wish you could have seen her she was much mor interesting the last 2 weeks of her life than before because she learned to talk much she possessed a lovely disposition you would have been pleased with it. I often kiss little Willford Owen for his pa. and think the poor child never had the privilege of seeing him but hope he will ere long - la it is said he resembles his mother much, he grew finely before he was sick. If you could get me a wrought muslin or lace cape I should be much pleased with it. If little Sarah could have lived I should have thought ^my^ troubles and afflictions were light but now I think they are serious. Please give my respects to all of the American brethren and the Saints around you particularly to br. Kingston and family where you make it your home.

 Ledbury, Herefordshire, England, April 24th, 1840.My Dear PhebeI again appropriate a little time to fill a sheet to you. which I shallmostly take up in giving an account of the work of the Lord in this Country. I wrote youa long letter while in Staffordshire at the potteries, but whether it has fallen into your hands ornot I do not know. You have been anxious No doubt to hear from me from time to time, &I have been equally as anxious to hear from you, but I do hope that you have not been asmuch disappointed in your desires in this thing as I have in mine for though I have writtento you as often as once a month since I left home, yet I have not seen the first markof your pen but once since I last saw you, & then you & Sarah was both sick in bed& you must realize that my desire has been vary great to hear from you Sisters Turley &Clark both wrote to their husbands & their letters arivd safe & I was in hopes to have herd aword about you some way but in this I was also disappointed, I do not make these remarks wishingto cast any reflections at all for I presume you have written several Letters to me sinceI left home but they must have been lost by the way somewhere. But I want you s[t]illto continue to write to me often for I may obtain some of them. I want to hear from you& little Sarah vary much. I continued Labouring in Staffordshire about the Potteries untillthe first of March when I left the church in that place in the care of Elder Turley numbering nearlyone hundred & I went into the South part of England about 80 miles from the Potteries or whare theword had been preached at all & I made a stand near Ledbury in Herefordshire[.] it is about 40miles from Birmingham, 30 from Bristol, 100 from London & bordering upon Wales, I commencedWorking & the Lord worked with me in a wonderful manner I first stoped at Mr John Benbows a largefarmer he was cultivating 5 or 600 acres of Land[.] his Brother William Benbow went from the potterieswith me to his Brothrs I expect you will soon see him in Commerce or Montrose for he has gone toAmerica & will call upon you. I arivd at John Benbows on the 5th of March I preached athis house on the 5th & was convinced that their was many that would come into the church I also preachedon the 6th & Baptzed 6 persons 4 of which were preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist order, John Benbow & wife were baptizedI preached on the 8th & Baptzd [◊] 7. 4 were preachers9th I Prechd & Baptzed 7, 2 were preachers10th I Baptzd 12 three were preachers13th I Baptzd 3.16th I Baptzd 320th I Baptzd 3 one a preacher21 I Bap 4, two preachers23d I Bap 12 one a preacher24th I Baptzed 9. four were preachers27th I Baptzed 7 four were preachers28 I Baptzd 2 one a Methodist preacher29 I Baptzd 13. several were preachers30 I Baptzd 9, five were preachers31st I Baptzd 13, four were preachersApril 2d I Baptized 9, two were preachers4th I Baptzd 11 women5 I Baptzed 9 three were preachers6th I Baptzed 5. one preacher& one Clark of the Church of England8th I Bap 7 four were preachers9th I Baptzed 5 in the midst of a shower of stonestha fell upon me from a mob10th I Baptzed several personsAfter labouring here one Month I receivid a letter from ElderTaylor in Liverpool stating that the Twelve had just arivd fromNew York & I must come immediately & meet with them inconference at Preston & so I left this part of the vineyard & travled 160 miles to Preston & attended a conference with the 12 & the church in general & had an interesting time. I was truly happy to meet our Brethren fromAmerica & immediately after the conference I returned accompaned by Elder Brigham Young & Elder W.

Mr William Benbow Left Liverpoola few day since for commerce I did not know that he was going so soon I had no chanceto see him before he went if he I had I should have sent some letters by him to you & someother small articles their is much of the spirit of gathering with the Saints in this Land JohnBenbow has sold his property to the amount of about £1,500 & wants to go as soon as the Lord will[.]I have had some scenes here some like ancient times soon after I commencd preechingin Ledbury or Herefordshire the Sound spedily went abroad & thee Ministers or preahers came morethen 20 miles in a gig to see me & inquire into thes things they never had herd me preach orany of our people & when they came to the house whare I was I had put on a change of clothingto go to the pool to baptzed a preacher that had baptized recevd my testimony I invited them into theroom whare I was & I asked them what their business was with me. they said they had cometo learn who I was & who had sent me & what message I had for them & the people. I thenstood up & taught them Jesus Christ & the first principles of the gospel & testified of the Bookof Mormon & the great work which God had set his hand to accomplish & while I wasyet speaking the spirit of God rested upon us & bore testimony unto them of the truth ofmy words & they bowed down & prayed & gave glory to God for his marvelous work & theyrose up & the Charriot stood still while all four of these preachers went down into thepool & I Baptzed them & lade my hands upon them & they recevd the Holy Ghost & wenttheir way rejoiceing. I went into the town of Ledbury to preach for the first time& as soon as the people herd that I was in town they gathered together in companies wantingto hear, the Baptist Minister offered to open his Chapel for me & he went into the pulpit withme & opened the meeting by reading the 35 chapter of Isaiah & praying mightyly for the Lord to blessme & make me an instrument of doing much good after which I arose & preached to 
 the largest congregation (it was said) that ever met in the Chapel & they did not have overan hours notice many appeared Believing, the Baptists Minister gave me his hand & bid me Godspeed, aftr meeting I Baptized 13, ^next morning^ & the Lord is opening many doors upon the right & left.

 Burslem Staffordshire Potteries England July 17th 1840My Dear CompanionAs I have occupied one of two pages as you will find in other letters in conversing about temporal matters & things of miner consequene I feeldisposed to fill this page in expressing my feelings unto you upon the great planof Salvation, sumthing of my present expectations & an account of the work in thisLand. When I take into consideration the day & generation in which we live even in this last dispensation & fullness of times, the awful calamity that awaits the gentileNations of the present age, The Allmighty work of God that is to be accomplised before the Comeing of Christ, the esstablishing of Jerrusalem in her power, & Zion in her glory, the pruning of the vineyard once more for the last tine, & form some small view of those greater misteries & glories of the Celestial Kingdom which are not lawful to be w[ri]tten & are yet to be revealed, & having a dispensation of the gospel committed unto me in common with my Brethe which is ^to^ accomplish the great work of God whichhe has set has hand, ^to do^ I say when I comprehend these things I do not summon wordsthat God has call us to make such great sacrafices in these last days, I now see thegreater the sacrafice the greater the crown [FIGURE] The ancient Saints of God have been called to make great sacrifices that they might comprehend a Selestial Glory, then if we enjoy the same glory we are called to make a sacrafise also, & have we not done it, yes verily we have equal to any people that ever lived according to the tinewe have been a people, or church of Christ I cannot make a greater sacrafisethan the society of my wife & family ^children^ but notwithstanding this sacrifice is of of the keenest kind to my wife as well as myself yet does my Bosom friend in her heartever for a moment wish me to scease doing the will of God, or in the least to tarnishour future & eternal glory, or to dim our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord-Jesus No I will not for a moment believe it. Then my Dear friend & companion still continue patient untill my return which will be as soon as is the will of Godthough we are seperated a few days here yet we shall reign & live together 1000 yearswith the children which God shall give us & also with our Lord Jesus Christ & we shall also enjoy each other society in a Celestial Kingdom to part no moreWe now laying the foundation here of a great work even directly or indirectlyamong all the gentile Nations. M ^our^ present intention is to spend the winter in Europe& return to Commerce in the Spring it is a great voyage & journey from Montrose to England & as we are hear it appears to be wisdom & the will of God 
 that we should spend a few months more before we return, The work of theLord is rolling on swiftly in this land & the present signs are that the gentiles willspedily be warned. Already are there thousands rejoiceing in the New & Everlasting Covenant in England, the standard of truth as an ensign to the people is reared up in the largestcities of Scotland, & Saints rejoicing therein The warning voice is spedily to be heardin the City of Belfast Ireland,  The cry is heard in Wales come & preach unto us Already ^has^ ^has^ the fulness of the gospel started upon the wings of the wind & the Bellows of the deep by the hand of an Elder of Israel to the east Indies, This vary day a gallant Ship spreads her sail at London into which Elder William J. Barret enters as his Ark to conveyhim in safty to South Australia to proclaim the everlasting gospel to that far distat peopleNotwithstanding he is but 17th years of age he is clothed with the power of the Priesthoodthe revelations of Jesus Christ, of the spirit of his mission. Notwithstanding he has this day left his native country & started on his voyage of 16000 [10000] miles yet he is filled with rejoicing & his soul is made glad, which is fully manifest in a letter which has just reached us from his hand exhorting us to be faithful & pray for him declairing in the name of God that he will return to Zion bringing his sheaves with him, he has taken our addresses in England & presidentJoseph Smithjr in the U.S.A. & sayes he will write to him after he esstabliseshis mission. he was raised up in the church at Stafford Shire Potteries. Thus you see the gospel is winging its way with the rapidity of lightning throughout the wor[l]d. Thus you see by the help of God we are laying the foundation of a mighty work throughout the European wor[l]d & other Islands of the Sea. We expect to spedily lift up the Standard in the City of London& visit France ^France^ & Jermany during the winter if the Lord will, The Millennial Starbegins to dawn & we hope soon to behold the rising Sun Now in the timefor us to prove ourselves, & work while the day Last lest night come when noman can work. & while the work is rolling on swiftly in foreign Nations Irejoice to hear of the progress of it in my own County esspecially this the seedof Israel in the western wiles have begun to receive the fulness of the gospel. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ to hasten the day when Ephraims Nobleswill be of himself & his Gover[n]our procede out of the midst of him & Judah rejoice& Israel be made glad, & Judah Jerrusalem be rebuilt upon her own heaps, & Zion become the joy of the whole Earth. Roll on O ye little stone cut out of the mountain without hands. untill ye become a mountain & fill the whole the whole Earth 
 O Lord let the fulness of thine everlasting gospel spedily go to all the gentileNations when they count themselves unworthy of Eternal life may the law be learned & testimony sealed in their midst that they be left without excuseMay Israel spedily return & seak the Lord his God & thy goodness in the Latter daylet the prayer of the widow & the cry of the orphan assend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaothlet the Heavens witness their tears & record them on high untill the Allmighty shallcome out of his hiding place & avenge those Widows & Orphans of the Spilt Blood of their Martered husbands & fathers which was shed by the Iron hand of the Inhabitants of Missouri for the word of God & the testimony of Jesus Christ. Let the American Nation spedily learn that there is a God in Israel who holds the destinies of all Nations & at whose command goes forth the Issues of life & Death. O Lord cloth thy Saints with Salvation & thine elders with the power of GodLet thy special witnesses be swift to the Nations of the Earth. Let council wisdom & the fear of God rest upon them untill all thy purposes are accomplisedconcerning them which thou dost Deign to perform Give thy prophets wisdom means& power to esstablish Zion & her Stakes to be throne down no more forever but to remain as an asylum & a place of refuge for the honest in [page torn]thee meek of the earth from the gathering storm which is about to fall [page torn]the heads of this generation.

 Manchester England July 8th 1840My Dear PhebeHaving the privilege of sending letters by a friend who is going direct to New York I will improve the opportunity of again sending a few lines to you which will ^be^ Mailed at New York City. My last letter which I wrote you was Dated June 8d in which I informed you that I recievd your letter under Date of March which was of much interest to me which is the ownly letter that I have as yet receievd from you since I have been in England. But I am now expecting letters from you every Day & I trust I shall not be disappointed in obtaining one from you soon. I am in hopes we shall not be under the necessity of waiting so long for letters from each other as we have done here to fore, for when we are begin to obtain letters in exchange I hope to obtain letters from you as Often as one in a Month for I shall endeavor to write as often as that & hope you will do the same. I have and shall have much that I would like to communicate to you from time to time.I am enjoying the best of health & spirits, & am happy; & I never enjoyed myself better while in the vineyard of the Lord. & could I Behold the faces of my wife & children often, it would greatly add to my joy & consolation: But Knowing that we shall have our reward for all the sacrafices that we are called to make in this life, for Christ sake, & for all that we do in his cause & y Vineyard, causes me to be reconciled to his will. I wrote a letter to Prsdt Joseph Smith, Jr. in company with Elder G.A. Smith, & T. Turley, June, 27th, In which I gave him a Brief account of my labours in the vineyard.We have held two conferences of late, in the South of England where I have been labouring; the first was held at the Gadfield Elm Chapel, in ^wor^ wostershire ^wosce^ ^worcestershire,^ England, June 14th. Elder W. Richards was with me, we had an interesting time, we organized 12 churches, & transacted much business; the other was held on the 21st of June, at Stanly Hill, Herefordshire, England. Elder Richards & myself conducted the meeting, or conferene with the help of God. & I never saw more business executed in one day, than on that occasion. We organized 20 churches, Ordained 4 Elders, 7 Priest, & 4 Teachers; Baptized 10, Confirmed 20, & Blessed 20 children, besides a multitude of other business, & broke bread to several hundred Saints, &c. The work had been so rapid, it was impossible to ascertain the exact No. belonging to each branch, but the whole Number is 33 churches, 534 members, 75 officers, viz; 10 Elders, 52 Priest, 13 Teachers, all of which had imbraced the work in less time than 
 four months in a new field which I have opend in Herefordshire, Westershire, & Glostershire & the church now in that place numbers over 600, & the work never in a more prosperous state in that place than at the present time: I had no doubt but what the churches in that place will soon No. 1000 souls. We have set all the churches in that region in Order, ◊ ^with^ Officers members presiding over them, & they are now Baptizing daily in that region, about 50 of those Baptized, were preachers of different Orders. Between 3 & 400 hundred of which, I have Baptized: & so you see the sacrafice which we are called to make, is not in vain. I feel vary thankful to God for the manner he has blessed me in my labours sine I have been in England. I also attended a conference the Staffordshire potteries on my way to Manchester, & had an interesting time. I arivd in Manchester On the 1st day of July, & I spe^n^t 3 days with the Twelve, & other friends in writing, transacting business, visiting the Saints, preparing for the conferene, &c. & had a pleasant time. On Sunday the 5th of July, I met with the Saints, & a large congregation of Citizens in the Joiners Hall in Manchester, for public worship: this hall, the Saints have hired for their regular place of meeting, they pay £100. (about $500) yearly; it will seat about 2000 souls; the rent is paid by contribution. There was about 1000 persons present, I preached in the forenoon & several testified in the Afternoon, while we were communig with about 400 Saints: the power of God was upon the people. Monday, July 6th the quorum of the Twelve & a general conferene of the Church of L.D.S. sat in conferene in Europe, met at the above namd place, & we had an interesting day; there were Elders present from every almost evry church in England, & Scotland; there was abot ^about^ 40 churches represented, containing 2,495 members, 59 Eldes, 122 Priests, 61 Teachers, 13 Deacons, making an increase of about 824 members, 25 Elders, 70 priest, 23 Teachers, & 5 Deacons, duringthe last three months; & 374 members, 9 Elders, 50 Priests, & 13 Teachers of the above number, were added in the Herefordshire churches in which ^where^ I had been labouring. But the foundation is now la^i^de in such a manner in this country, & new Doors opening in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, so that we have evry reason to expect a greater increas for the months to come, than has been in the thee that are past.I pray God to roll on this work in mighty power in this country & in all Nations & enable us to be humble in the midst of prosperity, & work righteousness with all diligence while the day last, & learnlearn that it is the mercy, & work of God that giveth us Souls as seals of our ministry. July 8th the Elders are mostly leaving Manchestr to day for their missions abroad. 
 The Twelve are all well, also Elder Hadlock, ^&^ Turley; & Clark excep Brothr Clark hashad a little of the ague.) Elder Kimble ^Kimball^ sayes give my love to Phebe.

Woodruff MontroseDated March 8th & 22d & most of these letters was full of glad tidings so muchso that it drove sleep from our eyes for the night. & we both felt more like goinginto the street & shouting Hallalujah than we did like being wraped in Sleep. You mayrest assured it created no small degree of joy in my mind to receave a letter fromyour hand for it is the first word I have recieved from you & the ownly one sinceI saw you excepting one letter which I receved from you while in New York.

We have this day receeved the first No of theLatter Day Saints Millennial Star. published by the travling council Edited by P P Pratt atManchester England.

I rejoice that we are not Called to mourn without hope, butthat we have the fulest assurance that we shall meet our Child in the first resurrectionAs we have got to come up through great tribulations in order to inheritthe Celestial kingdom of God, I rejoice that in all these trials, sacrifises losses& crosses, we have one the less to go through. I again rejoice that God hathgiven you grace, strength & fortitude, to support you in the midst of this deep affliction, & it hath been the highth of my joy, sweetened all my lonelylonely meditations, & filled the days of my consolation to know that God hathgranted me a companion in this life who hath been willing to make evry sacrafice which God hath lade upon her for my sake for the sake of Christ & for the sake of a celestial kingdom whare we shall reign forever, whare the wicked & ungodlywill scease from troubling & the weary be at rest, yes my Dear Companionin affliction, you may rest assured, the whole spirit of your letter the resignationyou manifest gives me great joy.

Ah the first resurrection will tell, the judgment of the great day will declare, & the Celestial glory of God will more fully illustratethe truth of all these things unto you then I can possibly do with my penthe Lord Jesus suffered & desended below all things, the Holy prophets & Apostles in evry age of the world have suffered greatly & come up through tribulationsin there day & now we have ours, & we shall find at last that all our sufferings trials, & privations are ownly to prove us & more fully prepare us to rightlyprise that rest, comprehend the glory, & enjoy the fulness of that reward which we shall receiveat the end of the race, Then under this view of things shall we not kiss the rod & beresigned, I can exclaim yes with every feelings of my Soul, I can say with myDear Wife the Lord hath given & the Lord hath given & the Lord hath takenaway & blessed be the name of the Lord. I I can but bear evry trial that I amcalled to pass through in this life as well as I have the Death of Sarah Emma I shall beethankful, she was a beautiful flower, I loved it with all all my heart but as willinglyresigned it to God. I shall never forget the last look she gave me when I took the parting hand with her. The first intimation I had of her death was on the 22d of Oct several letters was sent me from Manchester one of which was from Elder W. Richards &while reading over the list of the Deaths among the Saints Sarah Emma Woodruffcaught my eye, it produced a peculiar sensation in my mind which went through me like electricity yet my nerve was firm I continued reading as though nothing had happened & from that moment to the present I have felt perfectly resigned 
 so by receiving this intelligence I was prepared for the reception of your letterI also feel thankful that you have some friends that try to comfort you in your afflicitons & necessities, I feel that Sister Margarett has prooved herself afriend in deed as far as it hath been in her power & she shall not loose her reward & I feel thankful to all the friends for there kindness unto you in your afflictions, & Mourning. I copied Sister Margaretts lines in my journal they were sentimental & good. I thank Brother Petty for writing to me I was truly glad to hear from him. I feel to send my blessings to him & his houshold, Phebe I have had several interviews with you in my sleep & ^on^ one occasion Sarah Emma was not with us & I enquired where she was you said she was Dead & gave me sumthing of an account of it, but as I had heard from you since & she was well, it had almost worn of my mind, I found from my conversation with you you had manylonely hours, & some gloomy meditations, as you were left alone so long & had noRelatives to keep you company, I know this is trying & none would have bourn it better than you have done possessing that warm attachment to friends & Relatives which virtue hath been so perminant in your whole life, Was it in my power I would willingly bear your sorrows myself, but as I cannot I am comforted with the reflection, that these sorrowful hours are not lade upon you because of crime on your part or mine but that we are seperated for the Sake of the Gospel & the cause of Christ, If any of our friends are in any more comfortable circumstances as to the things of this present evil world in the midst of ease & without sacrafice, how will it be a few years hence at the coming of Christ in the resurrection the general judgment & in the Eternal World. my object is to be on the safe side there, My object is to secure a safe abode in the Eternal worldeven a Celestial Kingdom, yes if I can but once see this second to myself my wife & childen it will amply reward me for all my toils & laboursmy sacrafises & my hours of sorrow in this life, yes I can say wellcome all these things If I can but at last obtain the favor of my God & a place whare he dwelleth with my Wife & the children which God hath given us.My constant prayer to god is that he will feed & cloth you, comfort your heart, raise you up friends in my absens, & let his angels guard you & giveyou grace according to your day in all things & spare your life & the remainning child for my sake.

 G. S. L. City, Septem. 7, 1860Brother Gibson:Dear Sir:I received your two letters of June 15th, and Aug. 7th, respectively; both of which were highlyinteresting and edyfying. I read them to Prisident Young andcouncil, your daughter, Captn. Hooper and many other friends, who were all highly pleased to hear from you. Your daughtersays she writes you very often.Your letters please me they shew plainly that the spirit of your mission is upon you. Your labor in searchingout and stirring up the cold and lukewarm saints in the various branches through the country was a good work.Oceanicus' letter to the mountaineer was publishedand read with much interest.That the Japanese ambassadors to the proudhigh-minded Americans, could not find a linguist among theliterate of this great nation, who could speak to them withoutan interpreter till they met a Latter-day Saint, is rather significant and adds to the signs that Israel is to be head andnot the tail, and the mighty nations of the earth are begin-ning to feel a little of the forebodings of this truth, notwith-standing the present smallness of the little stone or kingdomwhich Daniel saw.

And I pray the Lord to blessyou and to inspire your heart, nerve your spirit and fully prepare you to magnify that station which you are destinedto fill before this generation; yes, brother Gibson as the Lordlives you have a great work to perform in your day and one too, that will not only cause your heart to rejoice in bearingtestimony of the word of God and the revelations of Jesus Christ andthe principles of life and salvation, but it will cause the hearts of tensof thousands of the honest of your fellow men to rejoice and be made glad because of the testimony which you will have power to bearwith your words and pen, it will also cause the ears of the wicked to tingle and their hearts to be pierced with much sorrow because of rejecting your testimony and the testimony of others of the servants of God.These things are true, they are the strong whisperingsof the holy spirit unto me, and if you are faithful not one [j]ot

 or title [tittle] shall fall unfulfilled, and the spirit of the Lord will bear testimony unto you that they are true when you readthese lines. And I would exhort you, bro. Gibson to be true and faithful unto the Lord your God, call upon him in mighty prayer, follow the dictates of his holy spirit andhis blessings will increase upon you daily, and the spirit of the Lord will be like fire shut up in your bones and your testimony will be strong and powerful before your fellow men and you will be enabled to say of a truth that you wouldrather be a doorkeeper in the house of God and associate withthe Lord's anointed than to partake of all the pleasures thatare found in the tents of wickedness.It is your privilege to constantly enjoy the Holy Ghost—to know the mind and will of God concerning youday by day—to be led by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit in every act of your life. This spirit will reveal to you every snare and trap, or evil of any kind that an enemy, whether it be men or devils shall lay for your feet, and will suggest a way for your escape.What great blessings the Gospel of Jesus Christ vouchsafesto all who obey its simple precepts and keep the commandments of God; yet how few place themselves in a position to appreciate these things. But I will stop preaching with my pen and refer to some items of news.From the specimen you sent me of the contents of theAmerican Biographical dictionary, I judge there will be a wide differencebetween it and the new American Cyclopedia in carrying inteligence

 THEDESERET NEWS.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.No. 18. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 1858. VOL. VIII.[Column 1]HISTORY OF WILFORD WOODRUFF.(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)IN tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account ofthe Woodruff family for more than three gen-erations.My great grandfather, Josiah Woodruff,lived nearly one hundred years, and possessed an iron constitution and performed a greatamount of manual labor nearly up to the timeof his death. His wife's name was Sarah; she bore to him nine children as follows:—Josiah, Appleton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda,Phebe, and two names not given.My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of Josiah. He was born in Farming-ton, Hartford Co., Connecticut, in 1751; he also possessed a strong constitution; it was said that he performed the most labor for several years of any man in Hartford Co., andfrom over exertion in hewing timber he was attacked with rheumatism in his right hip, which caused severe lameness for several years before his death. He married Dinah Woodford, by whom he had seven children,viz.:—Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus,Hellen, and Ozem.Eldad married Lewey Woodford; Elizabeth, Amasa Frisby; Samuel, Miss Case; Aphek,Beulah Thompson and Azubah Hart; Titus,Louisa Allen; Hellen, Amos Wheeler; and Ozem, Acksah Merrill and Hannah Hart; all of whom had large families.My grandfather died in Farmington, withthe spotted fever in 1806, aged 55 years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in 1824, in the same place, with a cancer in the left breast: her sufferings were very great.My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778; he married Beulah Thompson, who was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801. She bore three sons, namely:—Azmon, born Nov. 29, 1802; Ozen Thompson, born Dec. 221804; myself born March 1, 1807.My mother died with the spotted fever, June 11, 1808, aged 26 years, leaving me fifteen months old. My father's second wife, Azu-bah Hart, was born July 31, 1792; they weremarried Nov. 9, 1810; they had six children,viz.: Philo, born Nov. 29, 1811, and died bypoison administered by a physician Nov. 25, 1827; Asahel Hart, born April 11, 1814, and died in Terrahaute, Oct. 18, 1838; Franklin, born March 12, 1816, and died June 1; Newton, born June 19, 1818, drowned Sept., 1820; Ju-lius, born April 22, 1820, and died in infancy; Eunice, born June 19, 1821. I married her to Dwight Webster in Farmington, Conn., Aug.4, 1841[.]My father was a strong constitutioned man, and has done a great amount of labor. At eighteen years of age, he commenced attendinga flouring and saw mill, and continued about[Column 2]50 years; most of this time he labored eight-een hours a day.He never made any profession of religion,until I baptized him with all his householdinto the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the first day of July, 1838. He wasa man of great charity, honesty, integrity andtruth, and made himself poor by giving to the poor, and accommodating his fellow men by loaning money and becoming surety for his neighbors, and always saying yes, to every man who asked a favor at his hand.I was born in the north part of the town of Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford Co., Conn., March 1, 1807. I assisted my father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I was twenty years of age.In April, 1827, I took the flouring mill of my aunt, Hellen Wheeler, which I attended threeyears. In May, 1830, I took charge of the flouring mill of Mr. Collins, the ax manufac-turer, in South Canton, Conn. At the end of one year it was demolished to make way for other machinery. In March, 1831, I took charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. Rich-ard B. Cowles of New Hartford, Conn. In the spring of 1832, in company with my oldest brother, Azmon, I went to Richland, OswegoCo., New York, and purchased a farm and saw mill, and settled in business.At an early age my mind was exercised uponreligious subjects, although I never made a profession until 1830. I did not then join anychurch, for the reason that I could not find any denomination whose doctrines, faith or prac-tice, agreed with the gospel of Jesus Christ,or the ordinances and gifts which the apostles taught. Although the ministers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles and ordinances, which the ancient saints en-joyed, were done away and no longer needed,I did not believe it to be true, only as theywere done away through the unbelief of the children of men. I believed the same gifts, graces, miracles and power would be manifestin one age of the world as in another, when God had a church upon the earth, and that the church of God would be re-established upon the earth, and that I should live to see it. These principles were rivetted upon my mind from the perusal of the Old and New Testament, with fervent prayerthat the Lord would show me what was right and wrong, and lead me in the path of salva-tion, without any regard to the opinions of man, and the whisperings of the Spirit of the Lord for the space of three years, taught me that he was about to set up his church and kingdom upon the earth in the last days. I was taught these things from my youth by Robert Mason, an aged man, who lived inSimsbury, Conn., who was frequently calledthe old prophet Mason: he taught me many things which are now coming to pass. He did not believe that any man had authority to ad-minister in the ordinances of the gospel, but believed it was our privilege through faith,prayer and fasting, to heal the sick, and cast out devils by the laying on of hands, which was the case under his administration, as many could testify.In 1832, I was inspired to go to Rhode Is-land; my brother, Asahel, was also directedby the Spirit of God to go to the same place. When we met, we both told our impressions,and it caused us to marvel and wonder, what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island; but as we had made preparations to move to the west, we let outward circumstances control us, and Jonah-like, instead of going to Rhode Is-land, we went to Richland, Oswego Co., New York, and there remained until Dec. 29, 1833, when I heard Elders Zerah Pulsipher and Elijah Cheeny preach. My brother Azmon and I believed their testimony, entertained the elders and offered ourselves for baptism thefirst sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon, and I received a testimony that it was true.We soon learned what the Lord wanted ofus in Rhode Island, for at the time we were warned to go there, two of the elders were[Column 3]preaching there, and had we gone, we should have embraced the work at that time.Dec. 31—I was baptized by Elder Zerah Pulsipher; he confirmed me the same evening.Jan. 2, 1834—I was ordained a teacher, and my brother Azmon, an elder, and a small branch organized of 12 members by Elder Pul-sipher.In February following, in company withElder Holton, I walked some 60 miles to the town of Fabius, to attend an evening meeting of the Saints in that place, where Elder Pulsi-pher was presiding; I saw the book of com-mandments or revelations given through JosephSmith, Jr., and I believed them with all my heartand rejoiced therein; and after spending sev-eral days, and holding several meetings, wereturned home rejoicing.During the winter, we were visited by sev-eral of the elders. Feb. 1st, Elder Parley P.Pratt called upon us and instructed the branchtill midnight: we had a precious time. I ac-companied brother Pratt to Jefferson Co., and told him my circumstances; he said it was my duty to prepare myself to go to Kirtland, and join the camp of Zion. I immediately settled my business.April 11, 1834—With my horses and wagonI took brs. Harry Brown and Warren Ingles, and started for Zion. I met with Orson Pratt,John Murdoch and other Elders on the way, and arrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of April, 1834.The Prophet Joseph invited me to make his house my home; I accepted his offer, and staidwith him about one week. I became acquaint-ed with many of the High Priests, Elders and Saints. I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland and heard many of the Elders speak, and I felt to rejoice before God for the light and knowledge which was manifested to me during that day.May 1—I started from Kirtland, and went to New Portage, and remained till all the com-pany joined us, when we were organized.March [May] 7—We took up our line of march, pitching our tents by the way, and traveled to Missouri.After we had pitched our tents in Clay coun-ty (our numbers being 205) and many of the brethren had taken sick, and some had died, Joseph requested the camp to disperse, except enough to take care of the sick; all who had teams were required to leave the ground and go among the brethren. I went to br. Ly-man Wight's, in company with Heman Hyde and Milton Holmes. Shortly, Joseph called the brethren together at Lyman Wight's, and told them if they would humble themselves be-fore the Lord, and covenant to keep His com-mandments and obey His counsel, the plagueshould be stayed from that hour, and thereshould not be another case of cholera in the camp. The brethren covenanted to do do thisand the plague was stayed and there was not another case in camp.Prest. Joseph Smith returned to Kirtlandwith many of the brethren, I remained with Lyman Wight, laboring with my hands till the following winter.I had a great desire to preach the gospel, which I did not name to my brethren, but oneSunday evening I retired into the woods alone, and called upon the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preach the gospel to the inhabitants of the earth; the spirit of the Lord bore witness that my prayer was heard, and should be answered. I arose from my knees happy, and walked some forty rods and met Elias Higbee, a High Priest, with whom I had staid a number of months. As I ap-proached him, he said "Br. Wilford, the Spirit of the Lord tells me that you should be or-dained and go on a mission." I replied, "I am ready."At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wight's, Clay county, Missouri, Nov. 5, I wasordained a Priest by Elder Simeon Carter; Stephen Winchester and Heman T. Hyde werealso ordained Priests.Bishop Partridge said he would like to haveme go into the Southern States, through Ar-kansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, and if I[Column 4]could find any body who had faith enough to go with me, for it would be a dangerous coun-try to travel in, in consequence of the Missou-ri persecution, to take him. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where; and asked if I should go through Jackson county, as it lay in our route. He replied, it would be at the risk of life, and he had not faith enough to undertake it; if I had, I might try it. I also asked him, if I went through Jackson county, if I should start without purse or scrip accord-ing to the law of God. He answered, that he had not got faith enough to start on a missionthrough Jackson county without money, and if I did it, I must do it on my own faith. I felt strenuous to keep the commandments, so I started without money. I called upon Elder Harry Brown, and asked him to accompanyme; he consented, and Bishop Partridge ap-pointed him to go with me.Jan. 13, 1835—I received an honorable dis-charge from Lyman Wight, certifying that Ihad faithfully performed my duties in Zion's camp.I took my valise in hand, weighing 15lbs, mostly books of Mormon, and started in com-pany with Elder Harry Brown, crossed the river into Jackson county, and felt thankful. We bowed our knees, and prayed that Godmight protect us from the mob while going through the country, and that His judgments might rest upon the wicked who had shed theblood of the Saints in that land, that the land might be cleansed from sin. I had a petition to the Governor of Missouri, for redress ofwrongs perpetrated upon us in Jackson county, for the purpose of obtaining signatures. We bent our way south, through Jackson county, without any molestation; yet, in one instance, we were preserved from a mob of about sixty,assembled at a grog shop which we had to pass.June [January] 18—We called at the Harmony mis-sion and had an interview with the President, a Presbyterian minister. Although it was near sundown he would neither give us any-thing to eat, nor lodge us, because we wereMormons. It was fifteen miles to the nearest house, which was Jerrew's Indian trading house. We asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directions, but the Spirit said to me he was deceiving us. I asked him three times, and he declared he was telling us the truth. We followed his directions and wecame to the Osage river swamp, where we were lost in darkness of the night. We followed the river, but as it is very crooked, we made but little progress. After traveling through mud and water for one hour, we con-cluded to go out on the open prairie and lie down in the grass until morning, but when we got out into the prairie we heard the Osage In-dians' drum and shout at the trading houseas they were having a pow-wow. As we ap-proached, we were met by a dozen large savagelooking dogs; they smelt us in a friendly man-ner, but did not attempt to bite nor bark. We arrived about midnight, covered with mud, hungry and weary, and were kindly received and entertained for the remainder of the night by Mr. Jerrew, who had an Osage squaw for a wife; she prepared us a good supper, but marvelled that we did not drink coffee. She proffered us their best bed, which was highlyornamented, but we declined her kind offer, as we were wet and muddy; she made us a good bed of mackinaw blankets before a large fire, and we slept comfortably. May the Lord re-ward both Mr. Jerrew and wife, and the Pres-byterian minister according to their deserts.—19—Mr. Jerrew gave us a good breakfast, put us across the Osage river in a canoe, and we started upon our long day's walk, it being sixty miles to the nearest house; we had not anything with us to eat. Most of our travels through the day was through prairie; before dark we entered timbered land; as we ap-proached the timber a large black bear met us; we had no weapons. When the bear got within about six rods of us, he rose upon hi[s]hind feet and examined us a short time, an[d]went off. We were soon enveloped in su[ch] [page folded] 
 THEDESERET NEWS.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.No. 19. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 14, 1858. VOL VIII.[Column 1]HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)-[CONTINUED.]-March 2—We cut down a large cotton wood tree, and in two days dug out a canoe four feet wide and twelve long, put on a pair of oarsand then rowed down the Arkansas river, 125miles to Little Rock, begging our food by theway, a meal at a time, as we had opportunity. After visiting Little Rock we traveled down the river ten miles, and tied up our canoe on the east bank and stopped with Mr. Jones. I preached next day at his house. On the 16th we left our canoe with Mr. Jones and walkedback up the river ten miles, opposite Little Rock, and took the old military road, and started to wade the Mississippi swamp, which was mostly covered with water from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles. We waded through mud and water knee deep, day after day, andin some instances forty miles per day, before we could get a stopping place.On the 24th, while in the swamps, I had an attack of the rheumatism and could not travel fast. My companion, br. Brown, had got in a hurry, and wished to return to his family in Kirtland, and as I could not travel as fast as he wished, we parted. He left me sitting on a log in the mud and water; I was lame and un-able to walk, without food, and twelve miles from the nearest house on the road; he went out of sight in great haste. I then knelt down in the water and prayed to the Lord to heal me. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I was healed; the pain left me; I arose and went my way. Whenever I met with one or more families, I preached and bore testimonyto them.I crossed the Mississippi river in the even-ing of the 27th of March, and staid at a pub-lic house kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I was suspected of being an impostor. Mr. Jackson believed I was one of Murrill's clan, who were then murdering and stealing negroes, and to test me, he gathered together a large house full of the most wicked and corrupt people in the city, and set me to preaching, to see whether I could preach or not.I do not think that Mr. Jackson or the same company of men and women will ever meettogether again for the same purpose, for they would not like again to have their sins and abominations revealed to each other as point-edly as I told them that night, through the in-spiration of the Holy Ghost; they were glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms.I traveled from Memphis to Middle Tennes-see.April 4—I met with Elder Warren Parrish in Benton county. He and David W. Patten had labored together through the winter in Tennessee, and baptized twenty persons. El-der Patten had returned to Kirtland. I joinedElder Parrish and we labored together over three months, traveling and preaching daily,baptizing such as would receive our testimony,extending our labors in Tennessee and Ken-tucky.June 23—We received a letter from OliverCowdery, requesting Elder Parrish to come to Kirtland, and for me to remain and take charge of the southern churches, and the Lord would bless me in so doing.June 28—Warren Parrish ordained me an Elder. We baptized some forty persons while laboring together.July 23—Elder Parrish left. I traveled alone through the year, and extended my labors both in Kentucky and Tennessee. I baptizedforty-three persons during this season, thirty-one after br. Parrish left.Nov. 15—While traveling in the night with br. Benjamin L. Clapp and others, a tremend-ous storm of wind and rain overtook us. Wecame to a creek which had swollen to such anextent by the rain that we could not cross without swimming our horses; several of the company were females. We undertook to head[Column 2]the stream, to ford it, but in the attempt, in the midst of the darkness and the raging of the wind and rain, we were lost in the thick woods, amidst the rain, wind, creeks and fal-len tree tops; we crossed streams nearly twen-ty times. I was reminded of Paul's perils by water; but the Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were groping in the dark, running the risk of killing both ourselves and animals by riding off pre-cipitous bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone round about us, and revealed our perilous situ-ation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf. The light continued with us until we found a house and learned the right road; then the light disappeared, and we were enabled to reach the house of br. Henry Thomas at nine o'clock, all safe, having rode twenty miles,five hours in the storm, and we felt to thank the Lord for our preservation.During the winter and spring I continued to labor mostly alone, through Kentucky and Tennessee, opening new places, preaching daily, baptizing, confirming and organizing new branches.Feb. 26, 1836—At a conference held at br.B. L. Clapp's, in Callaway county, Kentucky, I ordained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyd-ston Elders, and B. L. Clapp and Daniel ThomasPriests.Brs. Smoot and Clapp both entered into the labors of the ministry. Elder Smoot frequent-ly accompanied me on my mission. Elder D.W. Patten returned to Tennessee in April, and joined us in our labors, accompanied by his wife. It was a happy meeting. He related to me the blessings he had received in Kirtland during the endowments. We traveled and la-bored together; persecution raged against us. Elder Patten bore a strong and forcible testi-mony of the work of God, and when we were opposed by mobs he would rebuke them ingreat plainness; we were threatened, but not injured. The sick were healed under our ad-ministrations.May 27—Elder Warren Parrish arrived from Kirtland. We held a conference on the 28th, at br. Seth Utley's. Seven branches were represented containing 116 members. AbelWilson and Jesse Turpin were ordained Priestsand Albert Petty a Teacher.—31—I was ordained by David W. Pattena member of the second quorum of Seventies.We labored over a circuit of several hundred miles; br. Smoot labored with us, and br. Clapp frequently. We traveled two by two, and all met together to hold conferences.June 19—A States warrant was issuedagainst D. W. Patten, Warren Parrish and Wilford Woodruff, sworn out by Matthew Williams, a Methodist priest, and served by the sheriff, Robert C Petty. Elders Patten and Parrish were taken by an armed mob of about fifty, under pretence of law, led by thesheriff, a colonel, first and second major, with other officers, and a Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder. I was in another coun-ty and therefore not taken. We were accused of prophesying falsely, by saying that four persons who were baptized should receive the Holy Ghost in twenty-four hours, and that Christ should come the second time before this generation passed away. The whole concern was a mob mock trial, contrary to law, justice, judgment or truth.On the 29th, I went to a Baptist meetinghouse, on Thompson's creek, to preach; thehouse was crowded. As I rose to speak, a Baptist priest, Mr. Browning, arrived at the door on horseback, and stepped in greatly agi-tated, and told the deacon to forbid my preach-ing in the house; at the same time commenced a tirade of abuse against the Mormons, tellingseveral lies, which I corrected before the peo-ple, which increased his rage. As I was for-bidden to preach in the house, and had been invited, and traveled many miles to fulfil myappointment, I told the people I would like to preach and was willing to stand on a woodpile, a fence, a cart, or any place they wouldappoint. A man rose and said he owned the land in front of the meeting house, and I might[Column 3]stand and preach on that, and welcome. All the congregation, with the exception of the minister and one deacon, arose and left the house, walked across the street and formed seats of a worm fence, and gave good attention while I preached for an hour and a half on theprinciples of the gospel.When I closed, Mr. Randolph Alexander, who had never heard a Mormon Elder speak before, said, the people of the present day made him think of a pen of hogs; the keeperwould make a trough, and pour into it hot orcold water, dish water or anything else, andthey would drink it; but let a stranger come along and pour over a basket of corn on the back side of the pen, and the hogs would befrightened and run and snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people; the priestswould feed them with any kind of doctrine,no matter how false, the people will swallow it down, but let a stranger come and preachthe gospel of Jesus Christ, which will savethe people, as Mr. Woodruff has done, and thepeople are afraid of him.Mr. Alexander invited me home, bought a Book of Mormon, and was soon baptized, and several others followed his example.July 14—I wrote a letter to Oliver Cowdery, and sent him a list of subscribers for the Mes-senger and Advocate, and a detail of my missionin the South.—18—I rode in company with A. O. Smootto a ferry on the Tennessee River. The fer-ryman was absent. We were offered the use of the boat, and ferried ourselves; but not being much used to the business, and losing one oar in the river, and having to row with a broken oar, we landed a great distance belowthe usual place with a high circulation of blood and blistered hands; but our horses leaptthe bank, and we went on our way to the Sandy, which we swam, and spent the night at Thomas Frazer's.—30—We preached at Mr. David Crider's, also on Sunday, the 31st, where we werethreatened by a mob. I baptized Mr. Crider amid the scoffs of the rabble, who went in the night and poisoned both of our horses; the one which I rode, belonging to bro. Samuel West,died in two days afterwards; brother Smoot's recovered; the swine that eat of the horse flesh also died.Aug. 11—I met with D. W. Patten and wife; he and bro. Parrish had been driven outof Benton into Henry Co., and Elder Parrishhad left for Kirtland.—29—We were visited by Elders T. B. Marsh and E. H. Groves, from Caldwell Co., Mo.Sept. 2—We held a conference at Damon's Creek, Callaway Co., Kentucky; several branches were represented, containing 119 members; Johnson F. Lane, Benj. L. Clappand Randolph Alexander were ordained elders,and Lindsey Bradey a priest by D. W. Patten, who baptized five at the close of the confer-ence.I was released from my labors in the South,and counselled to go to Kirtland and receivemy endowments, as was also A. O. Smoot.Sept. 19—Elders Marsh and D. W. Patten and wife, and E. H. Groves, started for Far West. I organized the first company of Saints,who emigrated from the Southern States, which numbered twenty-two souls. I appointed El-der Boydston president of the company, and counselled them to be united, and to remembertheir prayers night and day before the Lord.—20—The camp started. I spent a few days visiting the branches; baptized and con-firmed eight, and obtained thirty subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate.Oct. 20—In company with A. O. Smoot and Jesse Turpin, I started for Kirtland; this was the first time I had ever traveled on a steam-boat. We left the steamer at Louisville on the 28th, and spent nineteen days visiting El-der Smoot's relations and preaching among the people; we visited the Big Bone Lick. We ar-rived in Cincinnati Nov. 17, where we saw thirteen persons dead and wounded taken from the steamer Flora, which had burst her pipes[Column 4]while running a race; arrived in Kirtland onthe 25th, and had the happy privilege of meet-ing the Prophet Joseph, and many elders, with whom I was acquainted in the camp of Zion.29th, I heard Joseph preach in the Temple. In the afternoon I was called to speak and read the ##Isaiah 56|56th chap.## of Isaiah, and made someremarks, and gave an account of my mission in the South; Elder Smoot also addressed the Saints.I was counselled by the Presidency to at-tend the school in the Temple, taught by Prof.Haws. I studied the Latin language and Eng-lish Grammar, and boarded with bro. Ira Bond.I attended meetings with the Seventies and other quorums during the winter of 1836-7, and received much valuable instruction.Dec. 20, 1836—I was present at the organ-ization of the third quorum of Seventies; therewere twenty-seven ordained.Jan. 3, 1837—I was set apart to be a mem-ber of the first quorum of Seventies.—25—At early candle light, a cloud began to arise in the north east and reached to thenorth west, having the appearance of fire, andit soon spread over the whole horizon. The reflection of the clouds upon the earth, whichwas covered with snow, had a blood red ap-pearance. It commenced at about 6 o'clock,and lasted till past 10 p.m.—29—Prests. Joseph Smith and O. Cow-dery addressed the Saints in the Temple. Jo-seph blessed the people in the name of theLord, and said, if we would be faithful, weshould arise above our embarrassments and be delivered from the hands of our enemies.—30—I wrote an article on faith, whichwas published in the Messenger and Advocate.Feb. 19—I attended meeting at the Temple. Prest. Joseph Smith had been absent on busi-ness for the church, but not half as long asMoses was in the mount away from Israel; yet many of the people in Kirtland, if they did not make a calf to worship as did theIsraelites, turned their hearts away from the Lord and from his servant Joseph, and had engaged in speculation and given away to false spirits, until they were darkened in their minds; and many were opposed to Joseph Smith, and some wished to appoint David Whitmer to lead the church in his stead. Inthe midst of this cloud of dark spirits, Joseph returned to Kirtland, and this morning arosein the stand. He appeared much depressed; but soon the Spirit of God rested upon him, and he addressed the assembly in great plain-ness for about three hours, and put his enemiesto silence. When he arose he said, "I am still the President, Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Leader of the church of Jesus Christ. God, and not man, has appointed and placed me in this position, and no man or set of menhave power to remove me or appoint anotherin my stead, and those who undertake this, if they do not speedily repent, will burn theirfingers and go to hell.["] He reproved the people sharply for their sins, darkness and unbelief; the power of God rested upon him, and boretestimony that his sayings were true.March 23rd, was spent in the Temple by the Saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer. Pat-riarch Joseph Smith, sen., presided. TheSpirit of the Lord was poured out upon thepeople; a contribution was taken up for thepoor.April 4—I received my washings and an-ointings in the house of the Lord. I spent thewhole night in the Temple, with others of the Seventies, in prayer and fasting, the Spirit ofthe Lord rested upon us. After twenty-four hours I partook of food.—6—The Presidency of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, and other quorums, met in solemn assembly, and sealed upon our heads,our washings, anointings and blessings with a loud shout of hosannah to God and the Lamb;the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After spending three hours in the upper room, the quorums repaired to the lower court; the vails were lowered, and the ordinance of washing of feet was administered. Elder H. C. Kim-

VOL VIII.[Column 1]HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)-[CONTINUED.]-MAY 31—I left my wife and friends in Kirt-land, and walked to Fairport with bro. Hale; we were joined by Milton Holmes, and took the steamer Sandusky and arrived in BuffaloJune 1st, and Syracuse on the 4th; walked 36miles to Richland, Oswego Co., N. Y., and called upon my two brothers, Azmon and Thompson, whom I had not seen for several years. We visited the churches as far as Sackett's Harbor, called upon Archibald Pat-ten, and delivered to him some letters from Warren Parrish, in which were enclosed many one hundred dollar bills, which he had taken from the Kirtland Bank.We crossed Lake Ontario, visited Upper Canada, and attended a conference, May [June] 10th, with Elders John E. Page and James Blakesly, in the township of Bastard, Leeds Co. There were eight branches represented, containing 300 members, 13 elders, 5 priests, 8 teachers and 6 deacons. Elder Wm. Draper and my-self ordained 7 elders, 9 priests, 11 teachersand 5 deacons: five were baptized by Elder Page at the close of the conference.A woman was possessed of the devil and greatly afflicted, much of the time was dumb; four of us laid hands upon her, and cast the devil out in the name of Jesus Christ, and she was made whole, and gave thanks unto God, and went on her way rejoicing.We visited several other branches andpreached the word of God, and several of the sick were healed.We returned to Kingston, took steamer for Oswego, and canal for Albany; bros. John Goodson, Isaac Russell and John Snider ac-companied us from Canada, and left us at Schenectady, to join Elders Kimball, Hyde and Richards at New York, to go to England.We walked from Albany to Farmington, Conn.; attended a conference of the Saints inCanaan; arrived at my father's house July 6th. This was the first time I had seen my father or relatives in Conn., since I joined the church; they received me kindly. On the 10th, I preached in the City Hall in Colinsville, and a mob gathered and attempted to break up themeeting, with fife and drum, hollowing and yelling; they were urged on by a Presbyterian priest. At the close of the meeting the priestcame to me with his rabble, and asked manyquestions; he said I had no right to my opinion, and no man had a right to preach the gospel unless he had a collegiate education. I told him I would admit that point when he would tell me at what college Jesus Christ and his apostles obtained their education: the priest and rabble then left.—12—I preached in a schoolhouse in West Avon to an attentive congregation; after meet-ing I baptized my uncle, Ozem Woodruff, his wife and son, John, in fulfillment of a dream which I had at ten years of age.I visited most of my relatives in Conn., andpreached the gospel to them.—16—I preached at Adna Hart's in Avon,where I was met by my step-mother and sis-ter, also by my wife, who had travelled alone from Kirtland, and was on her way to visither father in Maine.—19—Elder Hale went to New Rowley,Mass., to visit his friends. I had been soli-cited to preach to the citizens of Farmingtonby many prominent men, but every room whichwas offered me, including the town hall, was closed against me by the Rev. Noah Porter, pastor of the Presbyterian church, until theMethodist church was offered me, which hehad not influence to close. Two hours after I gave out the appointment, the house was filled,and I preached to a very attentive congrega-tion, including my father and his household, for an hour and a half, upon the first princi-ples of the gospel; I gave liberty to the assem-bly to ask any questions, or find any fault with what I had said, but I met with no opposition.[Column 2]—20—I left my father's house, and, with my wife, rode by stage to Hartford.—21—Not having money to pay the fare for us both, I paid her fare in the stage to New Rowley, Mass., and I walked through a hotsultry day fifteen hours, averaging three anda half miles per hour, making 52 miles.—22—I walked 48 miles.—23—I walked 36 miles, and arrived at Elder Nathaniel Holmes', in New Rowley, at 2 o'clock, p.m., making 136 miles in a little over two days and a half. I met with my wife and Elder Milton Holmes, at his father's house: I spent several days in preaching to the Saints in that region.Aug. 1—We left New Rowley, and was joined by Elder Hale, who accompanied us to Saco, Maine.—7—I accompanied my wife to her father's,in Scarborough, Maine. We were kindly re-ceived: it was the first time I had seen any of her relations. We found mother Carter very sick. I spent several days visiting the Saintsin that region.—10—I accompanied Ezra and Fabien Carter, my brothers-in-law, on a fishing excur-sion; we caught with hooks 250 cod fish, had-dock, and hake, and saw four whales; it beingthe first time I had ever seen that class of fish that swallowed Jonah.—18—With Elder Hale, I started to fill my mission on Fox Islands; we walked to Port-land, and spent the night at Mr. Samuel Hale's.—19—We took the steamer Bangor 85miles to Owl's Head, where we arrived at sun-set, without means to prosecute our journey further. We retired to a high hill, and bowedbefore the Lord, and prayed that he would open our way; the Spirit of the Lord rested upon us, and testified unto us that our prayers would be answered. As we arose from our knees, a sloop came into the harbor; we went to the captain, and enquired where he was going; he replied, through the channel of Vinal Haven; he took us on board and landed us on North Fox Islands, at 2 a.m. on the 20th. We wandered in the dark about an hour, rambling over rocks and bushes, found thehouse of Mr. Nathaniel Dyer, and were enter-tained. It being Sunday morning, Mr. Benj.Kent piloted us to the Baptist meeting-house,occupied by Elder Gideon J. Newton, pastor of the only religious denomination upon theisland. At the door, I sent for the deacon,and told him I wished him to inform the min-ister that we were servants of God, and wish-ed to deliver a message to that people. Theminister sent word for us to come into the pul-pit; accordingly, with valize in hand, we walk-ed up into the pulpit, and took a seat on each side of him. When he closed his discourse, he asked me what hour we would like to speak; I told him at five; he gave out our ap-pointment, and invited us to his house. I asked him how many school houses were on the island; he said four, and gave me theirnames. I asked him if they were free for anyone to preach in; he answered in the affirma-tive. I took out my Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and laid them all upon his stand; he promised to read them.The hour of meeting arrived, and I preachedto a full house upon the first principles of the gospel, and bore testimony that the Lord had raised up a prophet, and had commenced to establish his church and kingdom again uponthe earth, in fulfillment of his word, as spoken through the ancient prophets and apostles. This was the first discourse ever delivered by any Latter-day Saint upon this chain of is-lands; Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave out appointments for preaching in the four schoolhouses. The people came out en masse to in-vestigate the principles which we taught. In fourteen days we preached nineteen discourses. Capt. Justice Ames and wife were baptized by Elder Hale. Elder Newton, the Baptistminister, with his family, attended twelve of our meetings, read the books, and was con-vinced by the Spirit of the Lord that our doc-trine was true, and he had a hard struggle in[Column 3]his mind to know which to do, receive it or re-ject it; he finally resolved to reject it, and commenced preaching against us. He sent for Mr. Douglass, Methodist minister, on the South Island, to come and help him; he hadbeen long at variance with Mr. Douglass, but they became very friendly and united in a war against us. We continued preaching dailyuntil we baptized most of the members of Mr. Newton's church, and those who owned themeeting house.I followed Mr. Douglas to his own island, and commenced preaching to his church, andbaptized a good share of his members, among whom were several sea captains. Ministers from the main land were sent for, who cameover and tried to put a stop to the work bypreaching and lying about us; but the work continued to roll on. They wished me to worka miracle to convince them that my doctrinewas true. I told them they had rejected the truth, and they would see signs, but not unto salvation.Vinal Haven, which includes both north and south Fox Island, is in lat. 44°, long. 69° 10'. The inhabitants are generally healthy and in-dustrious, and hospitable to strangers. The peo-ple obtain most of their wealth by fishing, andfit out annually over one hundred licensed ves-sels, beside many smaller crafts. The north island is nine miles long and two wide; popu-lation 800, and contains a post office, a store, agrist mill, four school houses, and a Baptist church. The land is rocky and rough, yetthere are farms which produce good wheat,barley, oats, potatoes and grass; the principal timber is fir, spruce, hemlock and birch. The rasp and gooseberry grow in great abundance. Sheep are the principal stock.South Fox island is about ten miles long and five wide, and is a mass of rocks, principally granite, formed into shelves, hills, hollows,and cut up into nooks, points and ravines bycoves and harbors; population, 1000. Thereare some small patches under cultivation, at the expense of great labor and toil. Many resident fishermen fish at Newfoundland, and bring them home, and dry them upon flakes; they annually supply the market with a great amount of cod fish, mackerel and boxed her-ring. The latter island contains two stores, three tide saw mills, six school houses, a smallbranch of the Methodist church and a priest.The timber is pine, fir, spruce, hemlock andbirch, also gooseberries, raspberries, whortle-berries and upland cranberries; bushes and timber grow out of the crevices of the rocks.There is a great amount and variety of fishin the waters around these islands, viz.: whale, black fish, shark, ground shark, pilot fish,horse mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,cod, pollock, tom cod, hake, haddock, macker-el, shad, bass, alewives, herring, pohagen,dolphin, whiting, frost fish, flounders, smelt, skate, shrimp, shad, cusk, bluebacks, scollop, dogfish, muttonfish, lumpfish, squid, five fin-gers, monkfish, nursefish, sunfish, swordfish,thrasher, cat, scuppog, twotog, eyefish, cunner,ling eels, lobsters, clams, mussels, winkles, porpoises, seals, &c. &c.Sept. 6—The harbor was filled with a school of mackerel, which were caught in great numbers by the people standing upon the wharf.While standing upon the farm of Eleazar Carver on the north island I counted fifty five islands, many of which were inhabited.Oct. 2—I left the island with Elder Hale;Capt. Ames took us to Thomastown in a sloop.—3—We walked forty six miles to Bath.—4—We attended a Baptist convention, and preached to a large congregation in the evening in Pierce's hall; the people listened attentively.—5—We walked thirty six miles to Port-land.—6—Walked ten miles to father Carter's in Scarborough, where I found my wife andfriends well.—9—I parted with Elder Hale, who re-turned to Kirtland. I continued preaching through various towns on the main land until[Column 4]Nov. 2, when I again returned to Fox Islands,accompanied by my wife.—15—I visited the Isle of Holt, twelve miles east, and preached to an attentive con-gregation, leaving them the Book of Mormon, which they promised to read. I returned onthe 16th.I continued my labors during the winter of 1837-8, and nearly every person had attended my meetings, and taken sides for or against. Our enemies made attempts to break up our meetings.Jan. 15, 1838—A company of sailors be-longing to the United States revenue cutter, brought on shore a swivel and joined the mob,parading near the house where I was preach-ing, and discharged it several times, accom-panied with small arms, with the intention of breaking up the meeting. Some of the mob gathered around to see what effect this wouldhave. I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgments of God thatawaited the wicked, and shook my garmentsin the presence of the people, and told them I was clear of their blood; but they only heardmy voice intermingled with the roar of cannonand musketry. Before I closed speaking, the sailors went back on board the revenue cutter.At the close of the meeting I baptized two, also one next day, and while baptizing, themob again commenced firing guns. The Bap-tists and Methodists got up the mob. Mr. Douglas, the Methodist priest, when argumentfailed him, applied to all the magistrates for warrants against me; they refused to grant them as he had no cause of complaint.Feb. 13—I crossed in the mail boat toHampden and ordained James Townsend; we walked together through deep snows, and visited and preached in the towns of Sears-mont, Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hamp-den, and twice in the city hall in Bangor, tolarge assemblies, and returned to Fox Islands via Casteem and the Isle of Holt. Arrived in Vinal Haven March 8. Elder Townsend re-turned home.March 22—I accompanied br. Stirrat, at low tide, on to a bar some forty rods from shore, to dig some clams. We were soon join-ed by Mrs. Woodruff and sister Stone, who had a curiosity to see how clams were dug. The ground for about twelve rods nearer shore was several feet lower than the point we were on, but we were so busily engaged we did notobserve the flowing tide until we were sur-rounded by water, and having no boat, our only alternative was to wade ashore and carry the women, which we safely accomplished amid the reflection that tide nor time waited for no man.April 4—Mr. Kent, the postmaster, showed me a letter containing two sheets of foolscapsigned by Warren Parrish and several of theTwelve, who had apostatized and been cut off from the church. The communication was full of slander and falsehoods against Joseph Smith and all that stood by him. It was sent with the intention of breaking up the workupon these islands.—11—I was visited by Elders Townsend and Milton Holmes, who attended conferenceswith me upon both islands, and bore their tes-timony to the people, but the spirit of oppo-sition increased to a great height. I was warned by the Spirit of the Lord to leave for aseason and take a western mission. Aftervisiting the Saints from house to house, and praying with and encouraging them, I left onthe 28th and went to the main land with Elders Townsend and Holmes. Mrs. Woodruff re-turned to her father's. We walked to Scar-borough. I left May 7th, and walked to Brad-ford, where I left Elder Holmes, and proceed-ed to Boston.May 11—I gave out an appointment to preach at sister Vose's room, and I went to Cambridge-port to visit Elder A. P. Rockwood, who had been imprisoned in jail on pretence of debt,but in reality out of religious persecution. The jailor locked me in until ten p.m.; but while it disappointed a congregation of people,it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood, 
 THEDESERET NEWS.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.No. 21. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 28, 1858. VOL. VIII.[Column 1]HISTORYOF WILFORD WOODRUFF.(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)-[CONTINUED.]-March 8, 1839—I attended a conference at Springfield, Illinois.—13—I took my family and started for Quincy, where I arrived on the 16th. I dined with Emma Smith at Judge Cleveland's. Ithen went on to the bank of the river near Quincy, and saw a great many of the Saints, old and young, lying in the mud and water, in a rain storm, without tent or covering, whichsuffering was caused by the unhallowed perse-cution of the State of Missouri. The sightfilled my eyes with tears, while my heart wasmade glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints inthe midst of their affliction.—17 (Sunday) —I had an interview with President Brigham Young and John Taylor. We held a meeting with the Saints; $50 and a number of teams were raised to bring out theremainder of the poor from Missouri. Prest.Young counseled the Twelve to locate theirfamilies for the time being in Quincy. I re-turned to Rochester for my effects. While at Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the Saints in Quincy, which I sent to them. I re-turned to Quincy on the 8th of April, where I left my family, and went to Far West with the Twelve and attended the conference on the Temple block on the 26th, where I was or-dained one of the Twelve Apostles, on the corner stone of the Temple, under the handsof the Twelve, Elder Brigham Young beingmouth. Elder G. A. Smith was also ordained at the same time. We returned to Quincy on the 2nd day of May.On the 3rd, in company with five of theTwelve, I went to Judge Cleveland's, and had a happy interview with Prest. Joseph Smith, who had just escaped out of the hands of hispersecutors in Missouri; it was the first timeI had seen him for more than two years, and it was a happy meeting. I attended the confer-ence and meetings with the Saints in Quincyuntil the 15th, when I moved my family to Montrose, and occupied a room in the barracks with Prest. Young and family. I spent mytime in attending the meetings, councils andconferences. I wrote in my journal the teach-[Column 2]ings, sayings and prophecies of Joseph from time to time, as I had opportunity.July 22—I was with Prest. Joseph Smithand his council and the Twelve: it was a day of God's power with the Prophet. He healed many who were sick nigh unto death, amongwhom were Elijah Fordham and Joseph B. Nobles; even the wicked rabble followed tosee the sick healed. As Joseph was about to cross the river a man came to him and asked him if he would go about three miles and healtwo of his small children, who were twins,about three months old, and were sick nighunto death. He was a man of the world; hehad never heard a sermon preached by a Latter-day Saint. Joseph said he could not go, but he would send a man. After hesitating a mo-ment, he turned to me and said, "You go with this man and heal his children"—at the same time giving me a red silk handkerchief, and said, "After you lay hands upon them, wipetheir faces with it, and they shall be healed;and as long as you will keep that handkerchiefit shall ever remain as a league between you and me." I went and did as I was command-ed, and the children were healed.On the 25th, I was attacked with chills andfever. I had a chill every other day and was very sick.Aug. 8—I laid my hands upon my wife andchildren, blessed them, committed them into the hands of God, and started upon my Eng-lish mission, leaving my family sick, and with not more than four days' provisions. Br. Brig-ham Young rowed me across the Mississippi in a boat; I was sick and feeble. When I landed I laid down upon the bank of the river on a side of sole leather. The Prophet Josephcame along and looked at me and said, "You are starting on your mission." I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a missionary;I look more fit for a hospital or dissecting roomthan a mission. He replied, "What do you say that for? Go ahead in the name of theLord, and you shall be healed and blessed on your mission." I thanked him. A brother came along with a wagon and carried me a few miles on my road. I started without purse or scrip, and passed by Parley P. Pratt, whowas hewing logs for a house; he was bare-footed, bare-headed, without coat or vest on. He said, "I have no money, but I have an empty purse; I will give you that." I went a few rods and found Elder H. C. Kimball build-ing a log cabin; he said, "I have one dollar; I will give you that to put in your purse." He blessed me and I went my way, accompaniedby Elder John Taylor. I had a shake of the ague every other day and lay on the bottom of the wagon while I traveled.We staid with Samuel H. and Don Carlos Smith at Macomb, and held a meeting withthe Saints, who contributed $9 to our neces-sities, and George Miller gave us a horse. Father Coltrin was going east; he took us into his wagon to help up us along. We spent fivedays in Springfield, where Elder Taylor print-ed fifteen hundred copies of a pamphlet uponthe Missouri persecution. We sold our horse, and left on the 21st and continued our journey. We spent the night of the 24th with Dr. Modi-sett, of Terrehaute.On the 28th, while traveling, Elder Taylorfell to the ground as though he had beenknocked down. We administered to him, and he revived. On the following day he fell again, and fainted several times; it seemed as thoughthe destroyer would take his life; we traveled with him four days after he was taken sick. His sickness proved to be bilious fever. Westopped with him two days, at a German tavern, in Germantown, Wayne county, In-diana, with a kind family, with whom he was acquainted. Father Coltrin would stay no longer; I proposed to remain with br. Taylor, but as I was sick with fever and ague, and notable to take care of myself, br. Taylor advised me to continue my journey with Father Coltrin, saying, "it is easier to take care of one sick man than two." I committed him into the hands of God; and the family promised to do[Column 3]all in their power to make him comfortable. I parted from him with a heavy heart.Sept. 2—I continued my journey with Father Coltrin to Cleveland, Ohio. I there took steamer on the 10th for Buffalo; had a severegale, and did not reach Buffalo until the 12th. I traveled to Albany on a canal boat; had theague daily, was very sick; had no companionexcept sectarian priests, who were daily lying about the Mormons. I took stage at Albanyfor Farmington, Connecticut, on the night of the 19th, and rode all night and the followingday; suffered severely with fever and ague. Iarrived at my father's house in Farmington on the 21st, quite sick. I found my father and family well.On the 27th Sept., 1839, my maternal grand-mother, Anna Thompson, died, aged 84; I was too sick to attend her funeral. It is a singular incident that my grandfather, Lot Thompson,and Anna Thompson, his wife, Samuel Thomp-son and Mercy Thompson, all of one family, died in their 84th year.On the 4th October, Adner Hart, brother tomy step-mother, died, aged 43. He requestedme to preach his funeral sermon. I had beensick at my father's house with the ague forfifteen days, attended with a severe cough, and the hour appointed for the funeral was thetime for my ague, yet I attended the funeraland preached, and I had no more ague for many days. I left on the 7th, and visited New York, Long Island, and New Jersey, in very poor health.Nov. 1—I assisted Elders Clark, Wrightand Mulliner to set sail for England. ElderJohn Taylor had recovered from his sickness,and arrived in New York on the 13th Decem-ber.Dec. 19—In company with Elders John Taylor and Theodore Turley, I went on board the packet ship Oxford, and sailed for Liver-pool, where I landed January 11, 1840, in goodhealth and spirits. When I left my father, hegave me some money to assist in paying mypassage; also gave me five dollars which he re-quested me to keep until I arrived in Liverpool, saying, I would there need it. This I found tobe true after landing; that money was all we had to pay our expenses to Preston, and wehad twopence left.We arrived in Preston on the 13th. Had ahappy interview with br. Willard Richards; held a council, and agreed that Elder Taylor go to Liverpool, Turley to Birmingham, and I to Staffordshire Potteries.Jan. 18—I arrived in Manchester; met ElderWm. Clayton, who presided over that branch, numbering 164 members. I was immediately called upon to visit a woman possessed with the devil; she was raging and foaming and hadto be held by four men. The more we rebukedthe devil the worse she raged. We continuedto pray and administer until we cast the devilout. She arose and gave thanks to the Lord. The devil then entered into a young child, andwe cast him out. I preached several times, and laid hands on twenty-eight persons. I went to Burslem on the 21st and met withElder Alfred Cordon, president of the Burslem branch, which numbered 66. I commenced preaching in the Staffordshire Potteries. El-der Turley left for Birmingham on the 29th.I remained in the Potteries some forty days, preaching, baptizing and confirming, and bless-ing children.March 1—As I met in the evening with alarge assembly in Hanley, the Lord revealed unto me that it would be the last meeting thatI would hold with the Saints in the Potteries for many days; I told the people it was the last meeting I should hold with them for a season; it created much excitement. I had appointments out for a week, which I got bro.Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in pray-er, and asked him where I should go; theSpirit said, "Go to the south." According to the directions of the Spirit, on the 3rd, I went to Herefordshire, and called upon John Ben-bow at Castlefroom; I found a people preparedfor the gospel. I preached twice at his house. On the 6th, I baptized six persons, including[Column 4]John Benbow and wife. I here found a society called "United Brethren," numbering about six hundred members, and about fifty preach-ers; Thos. Kington was the presiding elder. They came from all quarters to hear me preach,and believed my testimony; and I preached and baptized daily. The ministers of theChurch of England sent three church clerks tosee what I was doing, and I baptized them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and I baptized him. In about thirty days Ibaptized 160, forty eight of whom were preach-ers of the United Brethren, including their presiding elder, Thomas Kington.I established forty two preaching places,licensed according to law.On the 9th April, I had an apointment at Haw Cross. As I was going into the meeting, letters were put into my hands from ElderBrigham Young and others, informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve, and re-questing me to come to Preston, and attend ageneral conference. A vast assembly hadgathered to attend my meeting; the house, yard,and street were crowded; a mob had also gathered. I preached to the people; five cameforward to be baptized. The mob surrounded the pool, armed with stones. I dismissed the meeting, and went away; but the congrega-tion and mob remained on the ground till mid-night; and as there was no prospect of their dispersing, and the candidates were anxious tobe baptized, I went down into the water and baptized five in the midst of a shower ofstones. The water was all in a foam for a rod around me. None that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip and once on my head; the blow on my head raised a large bump, which went away while I was confirming: subsequently I baptizedmany of the mob.I left next morning for Preston, and attendedthe conference with the Twelve, and returnedto Herefordshire, accompanied by Elder Brig-ham Young, on the 22nd April, and was soonjoined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder Young remained twenty seven days, preaching, baptizing, confirming and counseling. Num-bers were added daily to the church: he thenreturned to Manchester.I spent about seven months in Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. Webaptized over eighteen hundred, including allof the United Brethren save one. We bap-tized over two hundred preachers of various denominations in that part of the vineyard. A synod of church ministers became so alarm-ed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard, they petitioned Parliament to adopt measuresto stop our preaching. They received for ananswer, that if they were as well acquaintedwith the Bible as their hunting grounds, and were as much interested in the welfare of the souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and foxes, they would not lose so many of their congregations.Aug. 18—I visited London in company with Elders H. C. Kimball and G. A. Smith. I labored with them in establishing a church,spending over five months in that populous city.We visited nearly every part of the city, and all the notable places that we could haveaccess to.I attended all the general conferences in England, and set sail with my brethren of theTwelve on the ship Rochester, April 20, 1841;arrived in New York May 20.I went to Scarborough, Maine, after mywife, and also my son, Wilford, who was bornMarch 22, 1840. My daughter, Sarah Emma,had died July 17, 1840.I returned to New York, and started for Nauvoo, via the Lakes; was wrecked on LakeMichigan in the steamer Chesapeake, but ar-rived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6, 1841, when Ihad the happy privilege of meeting with theProphets Joseph and Hyrum, and my brethrenof the Twelve.I bought a log house of brother Tracy, onlot No. 1, block 106, on Hotchkiss and DurfeeStreets. Prest. Joseph Smith afterwards gaveme the lot. 
 THEDESERET NEWS.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.No. 22. FILLMORE CITY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1858. VOL. VIII.[Column 1]HISTORYOFWILFORD WOODRUFF.(FROM HIS OWN PEN.)-[CONTINUED.]-CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.-[Written at Great Salt Lake City, February, 1858.]-VARIED and diverse are the lives and for-tunes of men; while the paths of some are strewn with flowers and ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturb theirpeace; others are marked victims of variedmisfortunes, accidents and dangers. The lastnamed class is the one in whose ranks I have stood, through my infancy, childhood, youthand manhood, up to the present time, so much so that it has seemed as though some invisiblepower or fate was watching my foot steps inorder to find some opportunity to take my lifefrom the earth. I can only attribute the con-tinuation of my life to the present time to a merciful God, whose hand has been stretchedout and rescued me from death in the midst ofthe many dangers and hair breadth escapes, I have passed through; some of which I will here mention.When three years of age, I fell into a cal-dron of boiling water, was instantly caught out, but was so badly scalded, that it was nine months before I was considered out of dan-ger.At five years of age, I fell from the great beam of a barn, striking my face upon the floor, which came near breaking my neck.Three months afterwards, I broke one of myarms, by falling down stairs. I soon afterbroke my other arm by falling out of a highstoop, upon a pile of timber.When six years of age, I came near beingkilled by a surly bull. My father and I werefeeding pumpkins to the cattle; a surly bull drove my cow away from the one she waseating. I took the pumpkin he had left, uponwhich he pitched at me. My father told me to throw down the pumpkin and run. I ran down a steep hill, and took the pumpkin withme, being determined that the cow should haveher rights. The bull pursued; as he wasabout to overtake me, I stepped into a posthole and fell; the bull leaped over me, after the pumpkin, and tore it to pieces with his horns, and would have served me in the same way, had I not fallen.During the same year I went into my father'ssaw mill, with several others; I got upon thehead-block to take a ride while the carriage was running back, not anticipating any dan-ger; my leg was caught between the head-block and the fender-post, and broke both bones of my leg below the knee. I was taken to the house, and lay nine hours before mybones were set, suffering severe pain; but beingyoung, my bones soon knit together and I was upon my feet again; during my confinement by this lameness, my bro. Thompson was alsoconfined in the same room with the typhus fever.When seven years of age, I was riding onthe top of a load of hay, which my uncle, Oz-en Woodruff, was driving to the barn; he turn-ed the load over upon me; I was nearly suffo-cated for the want of air, before the hay wasremoved.At eight years old, I was riding in a onehorse wagon with several others; the horsetook fright, ran down a steep hill, and turned the wagon over upon us; but again while in the midst of danger, my life was preserved:none of us were seriously injured.When nine years old, I climbed into an elmtree to obtain bark. I stepped upon a drylimb, which broke, and I fell about fifteen feetupon my back, which beat the breath out of my body. A cousin ran and told my parents Iwas dead; before they arrived at the spot, Icame to my senses, and met them.When twelve years of age, I was drownedin Farmington river, and sunk in 30 ft. ofwater, and after carrying one person to the bottom with me, I was miraculously saved by a young man, named Bacon, diving to the[Column 2]bottom, and carrying with him a large stoneto hold him down until he obtained my body,not expecting to save me alive: I suffered much in being restored to life.At thirteen years of age, while passing through Farmington meadows, in the depth of winter, the roads were drifted with snow; and in an exceedingly blustering day, I became so chilled and overcome with cold that I could not travel. I crawled into the hollow of a large apple tree. A man in the distance, see-ing me go in, hastened to my rescue, realizing my danger more fully than I did: when he ar-rived at the spot, I had fallen asleep, and was nearly insensible; he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sense of my situation. He procured means to carry me to my father's house, and through a kind providence, my life was again preserved.At fourteen years of age, I split my left instep open with an ax, which went nearly through my foot: it was nine months getting well.At fifteen years of age, I was bitten in my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of hydrophobia; he dented my hand with his teeth, but did not draw blood, and I was again preserved, through the mercies of God, from an awful death.At the age of seventeen, I was riding a very ill-tempered horse that I was not acquainted with; and while going down a very steep rocky hill, the horse taking advantage of the ground, suddenly leaped from the road, and ran down the steep, amid the rocks, at full speed, and commenced kicking up, and at-tempted to throw me over his head upon the rocks; but I lodged upon the top of his head, grasped hold of each ear as with a death grip, expecting every moment to be dashed to pieces against the rocks. While in this position, sitting astride of his neck, with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill under full speed, until he ran against a rock and was dashed to the ground. I went over both his head and the rock, about one rod, and struck the ground square on my feet, being the only thing visible that saved my life; forhad I struck upon any other part of my body, it must have killed me instantly; as it was, my bones crushed from under me, as though they were reeds. It broke my left leg in two places, and put out both my ankles in a shocking manner, and the horse came near rolling over me in his struggles to get up. My uncle, Titus Woodruff, saw me fall, got assistanceand carried me to his house. I lay from 2 p.m. till 10, without medical aid; then my father arrived, bringing Dr. Swift, of Farmington, with him, who set my bones, boxed up my limbs, and carried me in his carriage eight miles that night, to my father's. My sufferings were very great; I had good attention, how-ever, and in eight weeks I was out doors upon my crutches.In 1827, while attempting to clear the ice out of a water-wheel, standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft, a man hoisted the gate, and let a full head of water upon it; as soon as the water struck the wheel, it started; my feet slipped into the wheel, but I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim into about three feet of water, and my weight drew my legs out of the wheel, or I should have been drawn under a shaft and crushed to death.In 1831, while having charge of the flouring mill in Collinsville, Connecticut, I was stand-ing inside of a breast wheel, 20 feet in dia-meter, upon one of the arms near the top, clearing out the ice, when a full head of water was let on to it. The wheel immediately started; but I dropped my ax and leaped through it to the bottom, by the shaft and arms about twenty feet; as I struck the bot-tom of the wheel, I was rolled out against a ragged stone wall with only about two feet clearance between it and the wheel; the wheel caught me and rolled me out into the water below, where I found myself without any bones broken, but with some bruises and much fright.[Column 3]During the winter of 1831, while in New Hartford, Ct., I passed through a severe course of lung fever.In 1833, the day I was baptized, one of my horses, newly sharp shod, kicked my hat off my head, and had he struck two inches lowerwould probably have killed me instantly; inten minutes afterwards, while driving the same team down a hill on a sleigh without any box, the bottom boards slipped forward under the roller and caught the ground, turned endwise, and fell on the horses' backs, throw-ing me between the horses; they ran to the bottom of the hill, dragging me with the lines, head foremost, with the sleigh on top of me, about twenty rods over a smooth snow path: I escaped unharmed, however, in the midst of both dangers.In 1834, while traveling in Zion's Camp in Missouri, a rifle was accidentally discharged, and the ball passed through three tents, with about twelve men in each, and lodged in a wagon axle-tree, while a man was standing behind it, and injured no one; it passed within a few inches of my breast, and many others escaped as narrowly as myself.A few months afterwards, a musket, heavily loaded with buckshot, was accidentally snap-ped within a few feet of me, with the muzzle pointed at my breast; it had a good flint and was well primed, but it missed fire, and my life was again preserved.In April, 1839, in Rochester, Illinois, I was riding upon the running gears of a wagon with-out a box, sitting upon the forward axletree, when the bolt, fastening the coupling pole, came out, which left the hind wheels; and my weight on the forward bolster and tongue, turned the coupling pole over on to the horses, turning the stakes upside down, and shut me up fast between the bolster and tongue, but in such a manner that my head and shoulders dragged on the ground; my horses took fright, and ran out into an open prairieand dragged me in this position for about half a mile. I managed to guide them with my left hand, so as to run them into a corner of a high worm fence, where we landed in a pile together. I was considerably bruised, but es-caped without any broken bones.July 23, 1842—Prest. Joseph Smith, sent me from Nauvoo to St. Louis to procure a stock of paper. I went down upon a steamboat; was six days on the way, during which time I was severely attacked with bilious fever. The day I made my purchase the fever was so high I was scarcely sensible of what I was doing. As soon as I made my purchase and got my freight on board, I took my berth and lay there until I arrived at Nauvoo on the 10th of Aug. I was confined to my bed forty days, and pass-ed through the most severe fit of sickness I ever endured; my life was despaired of by many of my friends. I was administered to by Prest. Smith and the Twelve: my life was preserved by the power of God. I took a re-lapse twice after I began to recover; once while in council with the Presidency and Twelve; my strength left me, my breath stop-ped, and I felt as though I was struck with death.Sept. 12, 1843—At five o'clock p.m., I left Boston on the express train for Portland. While passing through Chesterwoods, six miles south of Kennebunk, after dark, and while going at full speed, we struck one of the rails which some persons had raised by rolling a log under it, and landed in a pile; three cars were filled with passengers, and their lives were saved by having a long train of freight between the passenger cars and the engine; all of them were mashed to pieces; the engineer was killed, some of the passengers had bones broken; I escaped unhurt.On the 5th of Oct., 1846, while with the camp of Israel building up Winter Quarters, on the west side of the Missouri river, (then Indian country) I passed through one of the most painful and serious misfortunes of my life. I took my axe and went two and a half miles on to the bluffs to cut some shingle tim-ber to cover my cabin; I was accompanied by[Column 4]two men. While the third tree was falling, which was an oak, over two feet in diameter, I stepped behind it some ten feet, and also to one side the same distance, where I thought I would be entirely out of danger; but when the tree fell, there being a crook in the body of it, which struck a knoll on the ground, the whole body shot endwise back of the stump and bounded, and the butt of the tree struck me on the breast and knocked me several feet into the air against a standing oak, and the falling tree followed me in its bound and caught me against the standing tree, and I came down between them; before reaching the earth, how-ever, I was liberated from them, and struck the ground upon my feet in a badly bruised con-dition. My left thigh, the whole length of it, and my hip and left arm were much bruised; my breast bone and three ribs on my left side were broken; my lungs, vitals and left side were also bruised in a shocking manner. After the accident I sat upon a log until Mr. John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwithstanding I was so badly hurt, I mounted my horse, and rode two and a half miles over a very rough road, dismount-ing twice in consequence of miry places; my breast and vitals were so badly torn to pieces, that at each step of the horse the pain went through me like an arrow. I continued on horseback until I arrived at Turkey creek, on the north side of Winter Quarters. I then be-came exhausted, and was taken off my horse and carried to my wagon in a chair. I was met in the street by Prests. Brigham Young, H. C. Kimball and W. Richards and others, who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before laying me upon my bed, the Presidency laid hands upon me, rebuked my suffering and distress in the name of the Lord, and said I should live and not die. I was then laid upon my bed in my wagon, and as the Apostles pro-phesied upon my head, so it came to pass. I employed no physician on this occasion, but was administered to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife. I lay upon my bed unable to move until my breast bone began to knit together, which commenced on the ninth day. I began to walk about in twenty days; in thirty days from the time I was hurt I again commenced to do hard labor.July 5, 1848—While on a mission to the Eastern States, I drove my carriage, contain-ing myself and family into the door yard of br. James Williams in Iowa, to camp for the night. I tied my mules to a large oak tree several rods from the carriage. As we were about to lay down in the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move my mules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage. I followed the dictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove, also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest. In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, which broke the tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood. As it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was two feet in diameter. Thus, by obeying the whisperings of the Spirit, myself and family were preserved.On the 21st day of April, 1856, while assist-ing to remove an ox that had died from poison and had been skinned, I inoculated my arm with poison, and mortification ensued. The poison worked through my system for seven days before it showed itself outwardly. On the 28th my arm began to swell, was in great pain and showed signs of mortification. I showed it to Prest. Young, who advised me to cleanse my stomach immediately, and put on onion poultices, and anything that would draw the poison from my system into my arm, which counsel I immediately put in execution. The 29th was another trying day to my life; the poison had so thoroughly penetrated my whole system, that my strength left me; I could not stand, I was led to my bed, my bowels and stomach ceased to act, my speech was like that of a drunken man. Prest. Young called, in company with Dr. Sprague, and laid hands upon me, and rebuked the disease and the 
 power of the destroyer which had seized mybody, and promised me in the name of theLord, that I should not die but live to finishmy work which was appointed me upon theearth. I soon began to recover. The poisonand mortification left my system and centeredin my arm, and was drawn from my arm thro' the aid of charcoal poultices, moistened with a strong decoction of wormwood, ragweed and wild sage; the dead flesh was removed from my arm with instruments and lunar caustic,and in a few days I was well again.I have occupied considerable space in refer-ring to those peculiar circumstances which have attended me during life, and to sum the matter up it stand thus:—I have broken both legs—one in two places—both arms, my breastbone and three ribs, and had both ankles dis-located. I have been drowned, frozen, scalded, and bit by a mad dog—have been in water wheels under full head of water—-have passed through several severe fits of sickness, and encountered poison in its worst forms—have landed in a pile of railroad ruins—have barely been missed by the passing bullet, and have passed through a score of other hair-breadthescapes.It has appeared miraculous to me, that withall the injuries and broken bones which I havehad, I have not a lame limb, but have been enabled to endure the hardest labor, exposuresand journeys—have often walked forty, fifty, and on one occasion, sixty miles in a day. The protection and mercy of God has been over me, and my life thus far has been preserved; for which blessings I feel to render the grati-tude of my heart to my Heavenly Father, pray-ing that the remainder of my days may be spent in His service and in the building up of His kingdom.

If you baptize, confirmordain or bless any person or administer to the sick write an account ofit if evry man will do this the church can write a correct account of itwe are not apt to think of the importance of Events as they transpire withus but we feel the importance of them afterwards we are living in one ofthe most important Generations that man ever lived on Earth & we shouldwrite an ofaccount of those important transactions which are takeing place beforeour Eyes in fulfillmen of the prophesies & the revelation of God there is a greatflood of Revelations fulfillig in our day & as they are transpiring before our eyes we want a record made of them if the power & blessings of 
 God are made manifest in your preservation from Danger & deathyou should make a record of it keep an account of the dealings of God with you daily I have written all the blessings I have received & I would not take gold for them. I am in the Historians office & I find it vary difficult to get or find a record of Events as they pastalong shuch as we want to make the History but if the Elders will takepains to write their Official Acts so the Historian can get hold ofthem it will be a benefit to the Church the History of this Churchwill remain throught time & In Eternity *Elder P. P. Pratt followed & backed up my testimony & said he had reflected upon this subject for years to know what a man should write& have come to the conclusion that a man should write his official acts in the priesthood I have been sorry that I have notkept more of a Journal than I have I wish I had written evrymans name that I had ever baptized or administered unto it is neccesary for us to keep a Journal.* W. Woodruff said if their was no other motive in view ownly to havethe privilege of reading over our Journals & for our children to read it would pay for the time spent in writing itI left while Elder Pratt was speaking & went to the Council House & attended the Agricultural Meeting see mintues of meeting in the D Newsof Sept 10th I spent the night at home was poorly in health Isuffer much in the rheumatismsSeptember 7, 1856 ~ Sunday7th Sunday I did not Attend meeting. P.P. Pratt spoke in the morn-ing upon the Priesthood & those who held the priesthood or the keys thereoffElders Tripp & Coleborn spoke in the afternoon. Br Trip said saidHe called upon Mother Smith & she clasped him in her arms (they wereformerly acquainted) & she said In My son Enoch I am glad to againsee you I am glad to see a man again from Salt Lake she cryed for Joy, and said she had desired for two years to be with the saintsin the vallies of the Mountains but others had hindered her she alludedto Emma she says give my love to Brigham & Heber & all the Faithful Saints for my heart is with themI attended the prayer Circle in the evening.

Pratt Head & blessed him President Young was Mouth I never heard a better blessing given to man it was notwritten at the time but afterwords an outline was written byElder pratt & filed in the Historians office Elder T.

C. Kimball & J. M. Grant & I want the 12 to go (BrotherParley says Brother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve there is here)I want to go through among this people & preach the gospel to them If I canget red of some of the care of my temporal business I do not feel that I am in the path of my duty to spend so much of my time in attendingto temporal Matters I think more of one soul than I do of all that I have scraped together I feel that with the assistance of my brethren thatI could make a great wake by going through this Territory & preaching the gospelto the people. I feel that some men ought never to be called upon to do anotherdays work but they should spend there time in preaching the gospel they shouldhave a man to take care of their Families this should be the case with P P PrattHe should spend his time preaching we should devote our time to the ministryas far as possible

Young called together the company of Lancers, Ballows brass band, Accompanied by the Nauvoo Brass band, & President Kimball Gen Wells Professor Carrington with many other Citizens in Carriages & went out to escort them into the City they past up the Emigration Canyon & ove met the Company at the foot of the Little mountain on the west side of it. Elder Edmond Elsworth Brigham Youngs son in Law was the captain of the first Company & Daniel D MCarthur was the captain of the 2nd company. Both Companies conta-ined 96 Hand Carts 8 waggons and 486 souls it was a vary effecting meeting Presidents Young & Kimball walked up the mountain through the company saluted the saints then organized the company for travelling in to the City one half of the Company of Lancers went in Front followed By the Presidency & citizens then the Marshal of the City J. C. Little then the bands of music then Capt Edmund Elsworthwith his Hand Cart company then Daniel D MCarthur with his hand Cart Company & the remainder of the Lancers brought up the rear in this way they started for the City capt Leonard Hardy took Bishop Hunter & myself into a Buggy & we met the company as they came intothe City edge of the City & we fell into the ranks behind the presidency ithe people of the City gathered on each side of the road & the streets were 
 & it was an Effecting sight to see such a strange sight about 500 people enter the City of the Great Salt who had traveled on foot 1500 miles having drawn there hand carts all the way women Children & old men had drawn their bedding, clothing & food, the whole distance & this company of poor people from England had travelled this whole distance in 9 weeks they were covered with dust & some worn down but cheerful they had beat any horse or ox team during the time they past up on South Temple Street by President Youngs House the Deseret Store by W Woodruffs, down to the grove then down to the public square, there formed in two lines & Camped for the night. No tongue can tel, No pen can write, the sensation it created in the reflecting mind to behold the scene, as soon as theywere camped President Young stood up in his carriage & called upon the bishops & multitude who had gathered to see the Hand Cart Company to bring them provision & feed them to night to morrow mornind & noon & night again, & while they stop here "I wish you all to tarry here untill you are dismissed & I bless you all in doing good & keeping the commandments of God["] we then returned to our homes & the bishops & people brought them all the provisions that were neccessary. Edmund Elsworth saluted his wives & children as He past his house but did not stop for any thing untill his Company was camped He lead the Hand Cart Company by drawing the front Hand Cart with 3 others it reflected more honour upon him than if he had been mounted upon a fine horse decked with gold & silver the sisters danced to the music as they drew the hand carts & wa[l]ked through the streetsSeptember 27, 1856 ~ Saturday27th [FIGURE] I called upon President Young in the morning. President Young sat & herd the minutes read of his sermons also Brother J. M. Grant & corrected them. President Young said it was thought a wonderful [thing] for this Company to walk so far but take many women that spin as some do & their steps counted & they would travel 30 miles in a day my children in ther play some times would run enough to make 10 or 15 miles in a day. wells Little & L. W. Hardy President Young said He thought the Hand cart company had a Better time than the teams had "they have not had as hard a time as we had in going to Moissouri in 1833 [1834] then I went to Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to Kirtland within three months over 3000 miles & walked all the way & lay on the ground evry night. But if I had to fit out a company I would have fitted out the carts different from what they were soon came in Lewis Robinson & ward from Green river. President Young said that washakeek the Indian chief had cut up smoothest bad trick that I ever heard of so Brother Robinson related the circumstances as follows Washakeek with several other Indians came in to his store & ordered him to give them some spirits. He told them He had none to sell they undertook to get it by force & robinson pulled them out of the store. He went away & soon came back with 100 Indians & pulled Robinson up to the door & told him he must open the door & give him some liquor so they forced him to open the door & deal out Liquor to them the 100 Indians drank 20 gallons & all got drunk but behaved varywell they offered to pay for the Liquor. He has been used to such sprees Brother Robinson said that if he was to do the same over again He should present a pistol to him & try his luck at it 
 Elder Elsworth came in President Kimball came to him & told him topick him out a family to go & stop with him through the winter wanted a handy man. He said I have not a handy man in my company but I will pick you out as good one as I can. Mr Dones came in & gave president Young some Notes against Capt James Brown of some $3000. Had paid some $1400 in county orders asked presidentYoung what He should do he would sell the whole for $1200 dollars President Young told him that He was able & as the Lord had made him Able the Law should make him willing he said that He was willing the debt should be collected but did not wish to collect it himself He said he had trusted him upon the credit of H. S. Eldridge. "It makes me righteously angry to see Elders go out on a mission & come home Merchants get trusted for goods & not pay for them.["]Presidents Young Kimball & Carrington Elsworth & myself rode down to the square to visit the Hand Cart Company they generally looked well & cheerful they shook our hands warmly they had a great quantity of provisions in Camp brought in by the people I laid hands upon one brother who was taken sick last night President Young said the people might have their hand carts after going through the Encampment & Elder Kimball got the family that He spoke for we rode back to the stray pen to look at the cattle & mules which the company had brought in Elder Elsworth pointed out a Mule which he rode after a Buffalo which He had wounded the Mule took right after the buffalo & the Mad wounded Buffaloo turned & took after the Mule & they met almost together but the Mule turned & run back sosuddenly that He flung Elsworth to the ground the Buffalo plunged at him & Elsworth punched the animal with the muzzle of the rifle into the Eye so hard a blow that the Buffalo fell to his knees but rose up & run the other way it broak his rifle his Mule run 5 miles to Camp which left Elsworth to walk inBrother George W Bean came in from Los vegas & reported that Jons was getting on well with his leadSeptember 28, 1856 ~ Sunday28th Sunday I attended the meeting.

Elder Dunbar sung &the Assembly was dismissed.I met at Early candle light with the seventies & Elders inthe Tabernacle the House was nearly Full the First seven presidentswere present with Joseph Young presiding. President JosephYoung occupied the fore part of the meeting in transacting the busi-ness of the Quorums 70 Quorums were called upon & found to be mostly full.President J Young then called for a subscription for the Seventies he got but LittlePresident J M Grant then arose & said I feel that there are some [FIGURE] things that greeve me. President Young was asked if it would not be well to send the Presidents of the seventies outHe said No they would Preach the people to sleep & then to HellNow this shows me that the Presidents of the seventies the first sevenPresidents are asleep and their is sumthing wrong with them. ifthis is the case that they would preach the people to sleep & then to Hell Then this body of Counsellors are guilty of Great sins either of omission or Commission & I would advise Joseph Young to cut off his council & drop them & appoint men in his stead who are full ofthe Holy Ghost & will act with him & assist him. Now we will takeup his council & look at them. Now here is brother Levi Hancockwhy he will fiddle diddle di fiddle diddle do fiddle diddle dum & tweedle diddle ta. Now he might preach a month & ther would be no more spiritof God in it than their would be in a Cabbage Leaf. Now If you would preach the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of some great Henious sins eitherof commission or omission you have either committed Adultery or some othersins & you ought to be droped. Here is Brother Harriman now if you will preach 
 the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of some great sins either of commission or omission have committed Adultery or some great sins & you ought to be droped. Brother Harriman might preach a month then you might put it allin the Eye of a Cambrick Needle & there would be as much room in it asthere would be for a bulfrog in the Atlantic ocean. Albert P Rockwood if you would preach the people to sleep then to Hell you are asleep dead, & guiltyof committing Adultery or some great sins there is no sap in you you areas dry as an old musk rat skin & you ought to be droped. And Zerah Pulsipherif He would preached the people to sleep & to Hell you are guilty of someabominable sins of commission or omission of committing Adultery or somegreat sins & ought to be droped & I will say the same of Benjamin Clapp& H. S. Edldridge according to the presidents words they are asleep & oughtto be droped.  I think that Brother Joseph ought to Cut them off & prune the trees around him how can the body be kept awake & Healthy whenthe head is asleep & dead. It has been with great reluctance that I havevoted for the presidents of the seventies for a long time And I will say to these seventies if your Presidents have gone to sleep dont you go tosleep. but keep awake. If your Presidency have committed Adultery & done wrong & committed great sins that will damn them dont youdo it but wake up. Is there any man that ins in that council thathas been ordained a councellor to Joseph Young if so I do not know it but each man was ordained a president & is under as much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling & do his duty but they never think of such a thing of taking any burthenupon their shoulders but leave it all for Joseph Young to do & he has todrag them along when I vote for Rockwood, Pulsipher, Harriman &Levi Hancock I do it vary reluctantly, & I have done so for years &now I want to have you to wake up & do yor duty. There is no lifespirit sap or Juce in Hancok, Harriman pulsipher, & Rockwood's preaching,to more than there is in an old mummy. These are the kind of menthat are your presidents. And the seventies as a body are as dry & dead as an old chip & you are as tight as the bark of a tree. It is the duty of the seventies to sustain Brother Joseph Young to furnish him with food fuel & rament that He may give himself to the work of the min-istry who has esstablished the president to take men who werein the battalion to be presidents I would take men who were full of the Holy Ghost I do not care whare the Hell they come from. Thisis what I want I say again the Presidents of the seventies are asleep and if they do not wake up they should be cut off. He spoke in the power of God & the gift of the Holy GhostLevi Hancok followed him & said He had not commit Adultery he nevercourted any woman but his wife & she courted him. He justified himself in a measure. He was followed by Benjamin Clap who said He hadnot committed adultery & if he hag [had] gone to sleep he had done it since he came here for he was not asleep when he came home. He intended to serve God with all his heart & was willing to go through this territorywith his pack upon his back & preach the gospel. A. P. Rockwood receivedthe chastizement & ment to repent & go into the waters of Baptism assoon as He got a chanceJ. M. Grant asked me if I had not sumthing to say that the seventies were under the Twelve. I told him I would like to bear testimony towhat He had said. I Arose & said to the people that I wished themnot to trifle with the teachings of President Grant for what He hadsaid was true he had shot arrows of the Almighty among the people and if they did not wake up & take the warning & repent of there 
 sins for the day has come when it will not do to trifle with the Things of God nor with his servants who hold the keys of the kingdom & are called tolead us I called upon the Presidents of the seventies & all the seventiesto begin this hour to call upon God for the Holy spirit & advised them to stop work & give themselves to prayer untill they could get the spiritof God I had the spirit of God in speaking unto the people I told themI had recorded what Elder Grant had said & I should keep it onrecord.I was followed by Joseph Young who spoke well & in a good spiritOctober 8, 1856 ~ Wednesday^[FIGURE]^ 8th I spent most of the day in the office President Young called upon me in the evening & spent about half an hour with me.

The Bishop said Hehad done the best he could & He did not feel to take the reprofBrother Balantyne arose & made his confession before the people which was except.W. Woodruff remarked that the people should learn a lessonby that Circumstance that no man in the Church has a right to reprove any man that is over him in the priesthood if he sees that he is really doing wrong He has a right to go to the man & pray him to desist but He has no wright to speak of it to any one ownly to report it to those who are over him that the evil may be corrected by proper authoritysamuel Richards followed & spoke upon the same subject, much toEdification.

Smith & T. Bullock red Church History to him I am aboutgetting inniciated into my office as assistant Historianwhile reading the revelation upon the patriarchal marriage &while reading that paragraph relating to sthe sheding of inno-cent Blood President Young remarked that that was a varynisce point to distinguish between innocent Blood & that which is not innocent. were we now commanded to go & avenge theBlood of the prophets whare it wood ^reach^ infants from the cradle tothe third & forth generation would they know what to do in such a case they would not. But their is one thing that is a consolation to me And that is I am satisfied that the Lord will not require itof this people untill they become sanctifyed & are led by the spirit of God so as not to shed inocent Blood. Again what does the sayingmean that sayes all shall be damned that does not keep this Law unto whom it is revealed does it mean that they shall take more wivesthan one. I think it includes the whole law with its covenants. I think that many that come into this world will be damned or disorgan-ized. And I think this is the Death that is refered to that the Broadroad leads to, while few will enter throug the straight gate into the fulness of Eternal life for their are many who will not keep the lawof life [FIGURE] President Young Had Brother Cannon take a Daguerreotypelikeness of the temple draft for Truman O Angel to takewith him to England.

I have faced Accident, misfortune, & apparently death so manytimes & in so many shapes & forms from my childhood through life thus far that it has become a proverb with me to say that there has seemed to be two powers constantly watching me & at work with me one to kill & the other to save me thus far the power to save me& preserve my life has prevailed. How long I shall be blessed with thispreserving power & care time must determin. I have never untill now 
 been called upon to war with poison & mortification in my systemuntill now, but I am satisfyed to day that I have this enemy to mee[t]& that to in its worst form their is but a small chance for a man to live that is innoculated with poison & mortification by dissecting the body of either man or beast it is much worse than drinking poisonor being bit by poisonous serpents for it is in a much more deadlyform. several have died this spring by skining cattle who have diedall should be more cautious than what I have been in this matter & not run the risk of looseing their lives by trying to save the skins ofAnimals who die with disease, the following Account will show the operation of this disease with me from day to day & how nearI came of loosing my life in fact I was ownly saved through the power& mercy of God. This morning the affected spot upon my wrist had grown about the size of a dime had risen above the arm & main [flesh] about half an inch & turned black as ink my arm began to swell& pain me & I felt its workings through my system I called uponPresident Young & showed him Arm and asked his advice He counciled me to go to immediately & clense my stomach & bowels& poultice my Arm with onions, Earth, or any thing that woulddraw it from my system. He also advised me to show it to Dr Sprague. I did so & he in addition to what President Younghad recommended dug me up soom sum dock Elecompance & Blazing star roots & advised me to make a tea of it & drink it also to make a poultice of it & put it on my Arm I wentimmediately home & began to put these things into execution for I saw that I had a strong warfare in order to save my lifeApril 29, 1856 ~ Tuesday29th  [FIGURES] Tuesday this was a trying day to my life the poisonhad so circulated through my system that it was affecting my whole body seriously I became so weak I could not stand uponmy feet it took two persons to lead me from the fire to my bedI could not talk no more than if I had been drunk. my stomach& bowels sceased to Act And to Judge from outward appearances it seemed as though I should not live 24 hours my wife & friends laboredwith me through the day faithfully & with Emetics & injections& with raw onion poltices upon my arm I got my whole systemin operation before night. President Brigham Young calledupon me in company with Dr Sprague at about evening I was some better than I had been through the day Brothers Young & Sprague laid hand upon me & blessed me thefollowing is a synopsis of the blessing which He pronounced upon my head which I wrote from memory After my recoveryBrother Wilford in the name of Jesus Christ & by virtue of the Holy priesthoodI lay my hands upon your head to Bless you And I ask my Fatherin heaven to stay the deisease which is resting upon you & to cleanse your Blood & to heal you up & I say in the name of Jesus Christ thatyou shall not die but shall live to finish your work which isappointed you to do upon the Earth, the Adversary has sought many times to destroy your life from the Earth but the Lord has preservedyou & will preserve you untill your work is done I feel to say that all isright here I fell to ask the Lord to bless all the means you make use of foryour recovery. You shall be healed up from this deisease & live toenjoy the society of your family & your children shall growup around you & you shall be a blessing to them let your heartbe comforted all shall be well with you And I seal these Blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ.

Evry thread & tie that binds man to manhas been broaken assunder (in consequence of receiveing the fulness of the Gospel of Christ.) Men have left their wives, wives theirhusbands children their parents & parents their children (Brothers their sisters & sisters their Brothers in order to be gathered withthe saints of God that they might partake of salvation). This people have proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of the way of life & salvation. This people have proven (to all men) that they can sacrafize evry endearment (in this life) for (Eternal) 
 life & salvation & we prove that we bear this principle throughevry difficulty (which we are called to pass through) it is our duty to make evry sacrafice that is required of us so that our Father in heaven, the Holy Angels, & all Just men who sit enthroned inglory power, & dominion may look upon us in this capacity ie that is that they may see in their Kingdoms that we do prove to themthat we are willing to make evry sacrafize ^if i may call it a sacrifize^ on Earth endearingto man in order that we may secure a seat with them in Eternal light & glory. (But not withstanding all the light & knowledgewe have of life & salvation) do you not see how easy it is for us to turn away to the right & to the left & say & do many things whichwe afterwards regret & wish we had not done is it not the casewith us all more or less, it is. I see a thousand weakness in myselfthat I ^now^ regret and it is so with all those who have the light ofthe spirit of God they can see their weaknesses (& regret them& they will try to over come them I can not ownly see these things in myself but I can see them in my brethren for when I learnmyself & Brigham I learn my brethren by this rule I know allof you) we give way to temptation and angry feelings against our Brother & want to be revenged on them. I ask is this arighteous feeling, No it is not, and yet we live day by day & week byafter week & year after year in this year way, thePeople will be guilty of a little lying a little swareing a little deceiving& a little stealing. do you think that you can repent of all yoursins & be forgiven in a moment. no you cannot, evry latter day saint knows better, this would be sectarianism, the religionof the world is that a man may commit Murder & when on the gallows he can repent & be forgiven & go right straight to Abrah-ams bosom but this is fals doctrin it is not true. Some saythat I cannot over come my passions when I am tempted & tried I cannot help giving way to my feelings I must give vent to them and scold & sometimes Sswear swear and I cannot help it. But I tell you that you can help it youhave got to help it sometime or other or you cannot be saved youhave got to begin to learn to over come, you should begin to im-prove day by day. Shun the errors as you see them and improve upon them be better men & women tomorrow than you are to dayContinue to improve there is not a man or woman here but what can do better here than they do. But says one Brother Brigham says hard words. So I do use harsh words. I am Death & Hell on the wicked, but you neverhear me speak evil of my brethren. But I will reprovewickedness among the Human family. As your leader Iwill say let us try to improve our lives. Let us overcome evrery temper and evil passion [that] arises within you you can shutyour mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet, and thenext time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep silence & it will give you a great victory. Mothers when you are cross & attempt to correct your children conquer your-selves first. Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions of your natures arise then you need the grace of God to helpbring yourselves into subjection that you may go in the spiritof meekness untill you get the victory over your feelings. we are liable to get out of the way we should not do wrong knowingly 
 for if we say or do things which are wrong we are under obligationto confess our faults, it would be a hard matter for me to confessthat I had done wrong knowingly. You should be governed byrighteousness. Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren & sisters like little children. when a person does a wrongin his foolish weekness look upon it as such. (we see the child[re]nof man laboring hard to obtain wealth they labour night & dayto obtain this object) but wealth will not give you wisdom, but if you will shun evil and extend the hand of charity to evry living being & do good to all (as far as you have an opportunity) this will grow in you & you will increase (in wisdom & knowledge) we should live so as to enjoy the spirit of Revelation that we mayknow the will of God concerning us in all things. You should not live for yourselves alone for if your Affections are not placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not possess charity you willmis the gate (& not enter into the glory of God yourselves) for youwill not receive the spirit of the gospel, your hearts should be empted of evry thing but the spirit of the gospel. (that you may be filled with the spirit of Revelation that you may know the voiceof the good shepherd for if this people was to loose the spirit of revelation & turn from righteousness they would be liable to be led down to hell but while the people keep the spirit ofGod & of Revelation with them they would know the voiceof the good shepherd.) If I was to get out of the way would not all that had the spirit of God se[e] it, as they did Sidney & Strang & Wm Smith, yes they would. When Sidney Rigd-on claimed to be the shepherd & leader of this people the peopleknew not his voice. But when the true shepherd spoke unto them they knew his voice and they followed him. It is theduty of this people & their privilege to live in such a manner that they cannot be deceived by any deceiver. It is your duty to live your religion. No man can magnify the priesthood & their calling unless they live their religion, unless they are filledwith the spirit of revelation, of the Holy Ghost, & of the Holy Priesthoodthen they can magnify their calling and do their duty to theirNeighbor & to all men then their would be an end to Bishops &High Councils trials. Parents are under the deepest obligation to live their religion And the young men & women also that whenyou get married your children may be begotten in Holiness &born in Holy^iness^ Brought forth into the world in Righteousness &then you cannot make any thing but Saints of them. Begin your work right Carry it on right. Bring up your children rightthen when they are old they will not depart from it.  This is the coven-ant which God made with Abraham that to his seed there shouldbe no end. And this promise was made to him when he was childlessHe received this covenants from the Lord & desired to see them fulfilledupon the Earth. Abraham was driven from his Father's house after he was driven f had received the Priesthood. The Lord Bestowedhis Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchisedekwhen Abraham received the Presthod the people were so wicked that no man would receive him but the Lord promised him aseed through whom the Holy Priesthood should be perpetuated forever and that to the increase of his seed there should be no endThe Lord promised to Abraham this great blessing A man can have no greater Blessing than was promised to him that He should 
 have Children who should have the priesthood. I would not ask the Lord for any greater blessing than this for myself the Lord Promised him that the various ordinances of his Kingdom should be administered through his posterity forever where everthe kingdom of God existed. Then let evry child for the future be begotten in Holiness and remember this one thing live your religionI now want to speak of another thing. A vary small portion of our time was spent in the Temple at Nauvoo whare we began to ad-minister the ordinances according to the words of Malachi in the 4th ch5th & 6 verses "Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great & Dreadful day of the Lord." "And He shall turn the Hearts of the Fathers to the children & the hearts of the children to their Fathers lest I come & smite the Earth with a curse"Abram received the promise from the Lord that his seed should be saved. And all the seed of Abraham in all the Gentile Nations or among the uncontaminated of the house of Israel will be gatheredThat have signned they have changed the Ordinances, & broakentheir covenants, or you would not see the children of these Mountains in the degredation in which we now find them. The Lamanites upon this continant are Manassehites almost exclusively, their is but little of the seed of Ephraim among them, they are counted as the seed of Abraham and they must be saved or they would not have become so loathsome as they are, they are punished in the flesh to make an attonement in the flesh for their sins & transgressions, and when they pass through the veil the enemy has no power over them. In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ all the particles of the Blood of Abraham will be gathered together The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years nor never will be again. If an Angel was to commence nowto number them all when he had got the numbers together before they could be computed there would be a great number more born during the time of there numerration so they could not be numbered & this is the reason why his seed cannot be numberedBrethren & sisters you are of the seed of Abraham & you should live your legio religion that you may claim the promises of AbrahamThis priesthood will turn the hearts of the children to the Ancient Fathers & the children to the Fathers now & those which are to come will be made perfect this chain must not broaken for mankind cannot be saved any other way. This Priesthood must be linked together so that all the children may be linked to Father Adam. It may be asked when will this work be done, it will be done in Temples in our day & in the days of our children. we shall go into the Temples & be pillars therein & go no more out & we shall plant trees & vineyards & eat the fruit thereof. I will call it theMillennium. I carry it in my heart I say it has begunevry saint carries it with him then let us increase in evry good thing & we will extend this influence from Zion untill it roots out evry evil & brings iall in subjection to the Kingdom ofour God. We will administer in the Temple which we have now begun & that is one point gained & we will sealed men to men by the keys [FIGURE] of the Holy Priesthood this is the highest ordinance it is the last ordinance of the Kingdom of God on the earth and above all the endowments that can be given you it is a finall sealing an Eternal Principle 
 and when once made cannot be broaken by the Devel when we return to Zion & build the great Temple which Joseph saw & the centre of Zion is Esstablished the glory of God will rest upon it by day & by night & those that are prepared will see the face of the sun of man & they will see Joseph & Hiram in the flesh in their resurrected bodies. Then will the armies of Israel be terrible to all Nations then will one chase a thousand & two put ten thousand to Flight. Who will resurrect Joseph's Body? It will be Peter, James, John, Moroni, or some one howho has or will receive the keys [FIGURE] of the resurrection it will proba-bly be one of those who hold the keys of this dispensation & has deliverd them to Joseph and you will see Jesus & he will eat peaches & Apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for wickedness will increase. Joseph & Jesus will be there they will walk & talk with them at times & no man mistrusts howho they are. Joseph will lead the Armies of Israel whether He is seen or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good Joseph has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you & I. After he is resurrected he will go & Bresurrect Brother Brigham BrotherHeber & Brother Carloss, and when that is done then He will say now go Brother Brigham & resurrect your wives & children & gather them together while this is done the wicked will know nothing of it though they will be in our midst and they will be struck with fear this is the way the resurrection will be all will not be raised at once but it will continue in this way untill all the righteous are res-urrected. After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected body He will more fully instruct us concerning the Baptism for the dead & the sealing ordinances. He will say be baptized for this man & that man & that man be sealed to that man & such a man to such a man, and connect the Priesthood together. I tell you their will not be much of this done untill Joseph comes. He is our spiritual Father Our hearts are already turned to him and his to us. This [is] the order of the Holy Priesthood and we shall continue to administer in the ordin-ances of the kingdom of God here on Earth. Joseph will not officiate in this low capacity any more neither did Jesus after his Resur-rection if so he would have baptized Saul but he was exhalted above the Earth and he told Saul to go to a certain man in a certain street & he would administer to him the ordinances upon the Earth. I say to you dont hurry in the ordinances dont do what you ought not it is not time to hurry we should not under take to do now what we ought to do 50 years hence. what have we to do to day. Purify your hearts that you may receive the manifestation of the spirit of God. When you sow your wheat you prepare the ground thensow your wheat & watch it untill the hearvest it is Just so in the priesthood you will be just as busy as you can be to do the things which are to be done to day. Now dont be in a hurry I say we are going to have time enough. I say I will be on the Earth to do all I can. Andafter I die & get my body again my resurrected body I mean to come back to the Earth again and fight the Devils and be here at the winding up scene I want to see righteousness prevail & the saints have peace on the earthI wish now to speak upon another subject I am here as the Governor of this Territory. And I wish to commence my remarks upon this subject with the President of the United States. Is he the Master of the United States no he is not. He is selected to sit there 
 as one of our servants to act for us to do what we wish to have done so it is with the congress & the Governors of the several States and I am here as one of them as the servant of the people. Congresshas prepared a constitution for this Territory which they call the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people as a community. They have said this Territory should be organized thus & so with a Govornor & Legislative Assembly and the right is given to the people to select 26 Representatives & 13 councellors Annually this body may enact Laws to controll each of us & all the inhabitants of this Territory including the governor the Judges the Secretary the supreme coart the District court & the Probate court. they have said they shall have all the power given to them by the Legislative assembly we have a Legislative Assembly & Magistrates courts congress will send certain mento hold supreme courts & send other men as officers to the Territory of Utah to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to make it as easy as possible. The United States Judges are not here as Kings or Monarchs but as servants of the people And when you see a Judge puting a city under Martial Law they manifest Boyism & you should pitty them & give them a peace of cake. If a man wants to be what he is not it is certain that He wants to get out of his sphere. when some men know a hundred words He thinks he knows all of webster some willtry to study a hundred sciences of the day & then know no more than a child. when a person studies Divinity 5 yearsthey are ownly fit to be put down upon the ground as a block to stand upon to get upon your horses. I see some here who have come 50 or 100 miles at the squa[w]king of a goose crow & dont you know if you want a court had there that the Judge should go there & hold it. And if a Judge dont know this it is because he is vary ignorant And He ought to ◊ ◊ learn his duty. I am perfectly asstonished at these my Brethren to think that if a man takes a pumpkin & says it is an Apple you mustacknowledge that it is an Apple & swallow it as such or if they take a rotton potatoe & say it is a peach then cram it down your throat as a peach. when you see a rotton Potatoe why dont you acknowledge it is a rotten potatoe. Now I say to you Jurymen & witnesses pack up your dudds & go home & stay there till you have business. If I come here & act the tyrant insted of a Gover-nor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought to be served in the same way when they get out of the way & act the fool or els let the people swallow the rotten potatoe & call it a peach I know the meaning the marrow & the pith of the Laws and the vary principle upon which they are built much better than the Judges do I know the meaning of them & the Duty of all theofficers in this Territory I say this for your instructionTo see men come here at the calling of a foolish boy, freezing your toes & killing your horses in the cold month of December is foolish-nesh when you want him send for him & pay your respects to him but they do not understand the Law. take some of the boys & learn them sumthing and treat them as Gentlemen & make them treat you as a Gentleman. when I see Lawyiers & Judges rising up here & saying that our laws are not right & we should not be governed by them, It puts me in mind of the Anecdote of the 
 of the fox that went to a hen coop to cketch some chickens the owner had had put a cord from the platform to a Bell ove[r]head so as soon as the platform was tuched the bell would ring as soon as the fox jumped onto the platform the bell rung & away the fox run with all his might but on looking behind him he saw nothing so he went back to the coop & examinedto see what the matter was He touched the cord with his foot & it rung but did no hurt so he jumped into the coop & got his chicken He looked up & saw the bell was hollow & had a longue tongue & the Fox exclaimed you are a poor miserable hollow headed Devil. Lawyiers & Judges should be made to keep the Laws of this Territory as well as other citizens & if they wont do it put them in a the way that they will be made to. And I say to evry man who has no business here pack up your goods & go home Let the Judges honor me, & our laws & the officers of this Territory or they will not receive any honor from me.I see one man on my right who will go strait & tell the judges what I have said he is a kind of perpetual Telegraph and if anyman come to me & says Brother Brigham do you mean me I will say you are the Man. (Alluding to Elisha Hoopes)choir sung I will praise my maker while I have breathBenediction By J M GrantThe people again Assembled at 2 oclok prayer By Dominicus Carter President Brigham Young addressed J M Grant Addressed the people & spoke much to our edefycation I reported He said if President Young did not entirely lift up the veil so that we could could look intirely through it was lifted so that we could have a glimps. He was folowed by E. T. Benson who bore testimony of the work of God.January 14, 1856 ~ MondayMonday 14th I spent the day writing president Youngs sermonJanuary 15, 1856 ~ Tuesday15 I spent the day writingJanuary 16, 1856 ~ Wednesday16th I spent the day in Joint session which was the last days business in the Legislature we done a great deal of business it continued untill in the night. we had a speech delivered in the Afternoon [FIGURE] from Canosh the Chief of the Parvan[t]s the following are sumof the remarks which He made. I am just begining to get my eyes open I [k]now that President Youngstalk is good what He says is so. He tells us more good I am like the sun just rising in the East & so with my people we have been in the night I have had Eyes but I could not see, & ears but I could not hear & this has been the case with my people our hearts could not understand but now our eyes see, our hears hear, & our hearts understand, all that Brigham & Heber has said is strait. But when I talked to Col Steptoe & his men their talk was not strait. I could not believe for a tenth part of their talk is not true & so with the spanyards & all white people till I saw the mormons they are the first to tell me the truth. You are here to make laws I hope you will make good laws to punish the guilty & spare the innocent. I wish to do right & have my people do right. I do not want them to steal nor kill I want to plant & raise wheat & learn to plough & it isdo as the white people do this I am going to do in the spring. I want to learn to read & right & have my children so we can understand what you say to us that is good[rest of page blank]

I attended meeting at the Tabernacle and herd Elder Orson Pratt Preach to the people upon our evry day duties. He thought the saints ought to be more faithful & interested in the spiritual things of the kingdom of God. He said that Allan Huntington [who] whowas appointed a missionary to the Indians had been guilty of swareing a great deal. He had herd him. it was then Moved & carried that He be cut off from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints it was carried unanimously. I attended the prayer circle in the evening. the candidate ticket for the convention was made out by the council. Arropene the Utah Chief attended meeting & sat in the stand with me to day. Brother P. P. Pratt said to me that He thought the three Nephites could not vary well visit the Lamanites yet & tell them to believe what the Mormon Missionaries told them lest there might be occasionally a bad man among them who would sware as Huntington did or would take the advantage of them in some way so that it would cause the Lamanites to loose confidence even in the Holy Messengers 
 February 11, 1856 ~ Monday11th I spent the day in the Presidents upper room with the committee to work on the reader. President Young kindly offered the committeehis upper room to work in while getting out the Books.[FIGURE] we met with the regency this evening at the Presidents upper room the work of the committee was red & excepted the rema-inder of the evening was occupied by exercises upon the black board Another committee of revision or examination was appointed to assist us who were appointed as the first committee. President Brigham Young has had his mind deeply exercised upon the getting up of the Deserett Alphabet & carrying it into the practical use He has laboured hard from the begining upon this subject & we are now making Books under his direction to be published in this Alphabet we have got to get the type made as the letters are entirely new from any others now in use. I am satisfyed that great good will grow out of the Deseret Alphabet it is an entire change of the English Auorthography of our English language, it spells all words by sound The committee who were last chosen were A. Carrington D. H. Wells & Wm WillisFebruary 12, 1856 ~ Tuesday to February 16, 1856 ~ Saturday12 to 16 I spent this week with the committee making Books. I attended Mrs Kimballs school friday evening which was a Juvinile polosophical society And the same kind of a school in the 14 ward taught by Mr Cobmbs the scholars have made good progress during the winterFebruary 17, 1856 ~ Sunday17thSunday I attended the meeting in the Tabernacle. Father Isaac Morley spoke to the people for a short time & was followed by President Brigham Young in a vary interesting manner. G D Watt reported & it is published in the [blank] No [blank] Vol of the Deserett News I attended prayer meeting in the evening circle. President Young asked Elder Orson Pratt what He thought of his preaching that intelligent beings would continue to learn to all Eternity. O. Pratt said that He believed the Gods had a knowledge at the present time of evry thing that ever did exhist to the endless ages of all Eternity. He believed it as much as any truth that he had ever learned in or out of this church. President Young remarked that he had never learned that principle in the Church for it was not taught in the church for it was not true it was fals doctr-in. For the Gods & all intelligent Beings would never scease to learn except it was the sons of perdition they would continue to decrease untill they became dissolved back into their native Element & lost their Identity.In speaking of this people He said if they would behave half deesent thiey would not be driven away from this placeI attended meeting at the 14th ward school House in the evening Elder P. P. Preached a good discourse. He told the bishop to cut off all the Liars thieves, Adulterers, & profane swarers from the church for they would rot the body if they continued on it. and many wicked men would stick by the church but they would never repent of their sins their was a time when men could repent & have the spirit of God but when that time was past men might pray till their knees were callaced & they could not get the spirit of God. How long did the people that were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could have the offer of the spirit of God or the gospel, they had to wait more than two thousand years till after Christ came & was crusiphfied. He then went & preached to the spirits in Prision. the gospel was then offered unto them. And how has it been with the Jews they once saw the day when the 
 gospel was offered unto them but when they put to death their king & savior the gospel was taken from them & given to the gentiles it was also given to the Lamanites & ten tribes of Israel. the first were to be last & the last first it will now come to the gentiles first then to the ten tribes of Israel & to the Lamanite before it will go to the Jews they will be the last to received it who has ever herd of the Jews having the spirit of God, or the Gospel, or kingdom of God offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Christ & the kingdom went to the Gentiles. No one for it has never been done. they will go home in unbelief & wickedness & rebuild Jerrusalem in that state & they will be so far from the gospel that when the Gentiles come against them to battle rifle their houses ravish their women & carry half of their city into captivity & Jesus Christ comes & delivers them in the midst of this hour ^of^ perrill & trouble they will not know him or even imagin Ho he is till they ask him about his wounds & he tells them that the gospel has to be preached to them & they repent & are baptized & receive the first principles of the gospel.He also said their was a promise that the three Nephites & angels should visit the Lamanites but they couldnot be sent to them with messages to receive & obey the Mormons untill all the Mormon Missionaries were righteous men & would not steal, lie, sware or commit Adultery for if the Angels were to tell them to obey the Mormons & they found the Mormons to do wickedly they would loose confidence in both the Mormons & the AngelsFebruary 18, 1856 ~ Monday18th I spent the day in the committee room to work at BooksFebruary 19, 1856 ~ Tuesday19 I spent the day in the committee room I attended a party at Mrs Kimballs school house with her schollars the evening was spent in dancing & speakingFebruary 20, 1856 ~ Wednesday20 I spent this day in the committe roomFebruary 21, 1856 ~ Thursday21st I spent this day in the committee room & the evening inthe seventies Hall with the Polosophical society & herd many good Essays speeches, songs & musical entertainment we had a good timeFebruary 22, 1856 ~ Friday22nd I spent the day in the committe room & attended two meeting in the evening one the Horticultural society & chose J.

Brother Lorenzo D Young addressed the People in the forenoon. He spoke upon the subjectof setting up the kingdom of God on the Earth in our day & the blessings which God will give us & refered to the coming of Christ in the flesh to the Jews who were looking for a 
 Great king to come to come sit upon the throne of Davidspake of the crusifixion of Christ. His blood was shed & that Nation had to be chastized in consequence of it & they deserved it for they were worthy we know the Blood of Christ was shed for the redemption of mankindHe spoke of the Endowments in the temple said the people alwayswere afraid of the truth & always prejudiced against the profitsof God but that did not stop the spread of the work of God, some say shall we stay here long I do not know but I can say thatwe shall stay as long as we wish to. If all the Nations of the Earth were to come against us they could not drive us away if we doing our duty before the Lord & put our trust in him& do unto all men as we would wish to be done by in all things& if all will do this we shall not have much trouble in thekingdom of God some think that we have not as much faithas we used to have I cannot believe this I believe we areadvanceing in the kingdom of God. some are much tryed because all are not healed that they lay hands upon but I do not feelso I had a case during conference concerning the case of Sister Baris she was sick & I laid Hands upon her & blessedher with life & helth & went to meeting in an hour I had word that she was dead. it did not try me. the Lord saw fit totake her & all is right. there is many duties devolving upon us& one of these duties are to pay our debts if I owe a man & He comes to me & says you owe me so much & I need it in my family I will pay that man to the full extent of my power I will divide the last loaf with him. I consider this one of our duties & I will say I never knew a man get rich by taking great Interest neither do I ever expe[c]t to. He requested the Brethrento remember the Twelve & administer in temporalthings while they Administered in spiritual thingsSunday PM. Elder O. Pratt addressed the AssembHe arose & said I should have been pleased to have heardfrom Brother Woodruff & others if [I] had not been caledupon to speak I dont know when I have been morEdifyed than in the discourses I have heard at this conference esspecially the discours of Brother Parley yesterday morning it was so plain & simple I tried to enter into the feelings of the speaker. I tryed tobring mysel[f] to this scene & fancied to mysel[f] how Iwould feel in Hearing the message of Glad tidings thata savior was born & also in being associated with himin life then the sorrow of his being taken away & crucified then the great Joy in his resurrection & his teachingswhile in his Immortal body. but when I think ofthe greater things which are to take place in ourday I do not regret that I did not live in that dayfor there are greater things to come forth than wasmanifest in that day. For that kingdom of God of whichall the prophets have spoken since the world began has now come forth as a preparation for the second coming ofChrist not coming to be born in a manger but He will 
 come From Heaven clothed with all that great Glory & powerof which the prophets have spoken no are we preparing forth^i^se great Event now if a stranger was to come to usthey would not suppose that we were preparing for thisgreat Event but was merely cultivating the Earth to raisepotatoes corn wheat &c. I do not believe for a moment that is the case for I do believe that this people are preparingfor the Coming of Christ. what will take place at thattime I have red in the book of mormon what that booksays will take plase we can read the great things that arespoken in that Book. (He read some unto the people) I willtake it to myself I will ^having^ not been as diligent in readi[ng]that Book as I should have been I have red many otherbooks of late but not so much in the book of Mormon as formerlyI have seen the time that I could read nearly whole Booksin the book of Mormon without looking upon that book I am trying to get all the sayings in the Books in my own mind that are spoken concerning the signs of the times in the day in which we live for I am well aware that it will over-take many as a thief in the night in the midst of the saintsnow let us look at the tokens or signs of the times thatare passing before us as many as present themselves to our minds. I will read a revelation given to P P P[r]att& others "Jesus Christ will not come in the form of a woman nor like a man walking upon the face of theEarth. but look forth for the Heavens to be shaken & themountains to be laid low &c. when shall thes things bewhen the Angel shall sound his trumpet two events willtake place at the same time, also the Lord said the La-manites shall Blossom as the rose in the wilderness now we know that this will not take place in a moment for we know it will take some time to prepare the Lamanites for this work it will require a greatmiracle to bring that people to that state or it willtake some great changes to bring it about this is but one of the Events that is to take place before the comingof Christ. I am glad to hear the account of the brethrenwho have gone among that people I am satisfied that that people will not be prepared to receive the blessings ofGod untill they cultivate the Earth & when this [is] done we shall Have accomplished the great work but ^not^ untill that time is done then sumthing will be done then wewill be inspired to teach them. & ther children and all men will be blessed who labour faithfully to bring them to this state of things. Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness the Lamanites shall blossom as the rosewe shall hear of Israel and of their prophets & Revelations in other parts of the Earth. I do not say that they will have the priesthood from this people nor I do not say they will not for there are other men who holdthe [FIGURE] keys of the kingdom of God on the earth the Revela-tor & the three Nephits hold the keys of the kingdomof God & they will administer unto the children of menZion shall flourish upon the Hills & rejoice excedingly 
 upon the mountains when this revelations was giventhere was no gathering at all Joseph had got to KirtlandI have no idea that the prophet himself knew at that time whare this would be. we are now here in themountains in fulfillment of that Prophesy and Revelation. Also in the 40th chapter of Isaiah com-forting words were spoken concerning the Jews & Jerrusalemthey were to go to Jerrusalem for they had receiveddouble reward for all their sins now comfort thema did all thes things take place in the wilderness in Zion& in Jerrusalem in the days of the ^Birth of the^ Savior No they did notthen that same John Had yet to do a great work in the Earth in the last days who first delivered the priesthood to Joseph Smith the prophet & founder of the Church of Christ in this dispensation it was this same John the Baptist so he has fullfilled a part of his last day mis-sion. O Zion get the[e] up into the High mountains thatbringest good tidings we say that this was not done at its first organization. why shall Zion get up into the High mountains w[h]y to Judge the Nations ofthe Earth. this people will know righteous Judgmentthis people will be protected & shall Judge the people of the Earth. it is said God will pour out knowledge & power upon Zion these [are] some of the things that willtake place before the coming of Christ. now that we mayknow that this is the case see what the Lord saysBehold the Lord will come He will gather his people& carry them in his arms. we have come up Herein these mountains. well now have we flourishedyes we have, we have flourished yet not as muchas we shall. the Lord has said that we shall be the rivalof all people yet we are cautioned to beware of pride lest we become like the Nephites of old & some pro[p]h[e]tshave said that we should be chastized that the churchwandered in the wilderness were faint & ready to fall downthis people from the commencement have passed throughoppression & difficulty we that have not been in thechurch from an Early day & do not know the Historyof it can learn it by reading the News published in Salt Lake City and we can Just as well readthe future History & events of this church by readingthe prophets that have spoken concerning us. shallwe be in these mountains when Christ comes Noat least head quarters will not be here it will haveto be on more ground it will be in Jackson Co Mowe may leave some Millions here but the Head quarterswill be on more ground where shall we go to the new Jerrusalem whare there will be built a great Capitol& Temple & we have got to build it, we & all our children who are 8 years old know that when we have tryedto build a city the Lord has suffered it to be thrown downso that we may have experince so that we shall know how to build up a New Jerrusalem so that it willbe exceptable unto the Lord so that it will never bethrown down but be saved & taken into Heaven 
 and preserved in Eternity & when that is done Jesus Christ will come to visit it Angels will come that will be before the great day of Christ coming & our dwellings will be overshadowed bwith a cloud by day & a pillow of fire by night so we can see to get home without stumblingit will be the most improved plan of ligh[t]ing up our City. How will it be with the Lamanites they will be the most important actors in the scene we shall be secondly in that work they will be so delightful & have such great knowledge of Architecture that they will be able to build up a New Jerrusalem then we shall go out throughout all the land to gather all the remnant of Jacob the Lamanites to come to the New Jerrusalem what For why that they may be prepared to be caught up to meet Christ in the clouds of Heaven then Christ will come & stand in the midst of this people & they will be prepared to be caught up to meet Jesus Christ in the air then do I want to have lived in the day when Christ was born no I do not I would rath[er] live in this age now some of us may live in that day to see the seed of Israel gathered what should you expect we should expect to see Jesus come but should we see him come without any sign No we should see Angels flying through the Heavens crying to all the Earth to prepare for the great day of Judgment is coming what next should we see there will be a sign that all people will see in all the Earth as Israel made a calf to worship so will there be five foolish virgins in the midst of all these signs. what shall we hear then. we shall hear another Trumpet sounded saying that the great day of God will come upon Babylon that her bands are made strong so that No man can loose them then shall the curtain of Heaven be unfolded as a scroll so you can see it as you would gaze upon a map then you may know the time has come for the saints of God to be caught up into Heaven that will be the great day for the saints of God, but awful to the wicked then the Earth will reel to & fro like a drunken man it will be the greatest Earthquake there ever has been On Earth what next will take place the graves of the saints will be opened & they will come forth out of their gravs clothed with glory Immortality & Eternal life & Enter in to the cloud Jesus Christ does not come yet for there is other signs to take place. The Angels are to sound there Trumpets O what must be the feelings of the people of all the Earth when they see the Heavens opened & the New Jerrusa-lem with all its inhabitants & the resurrected saints all asscend into the cloud while they are left upon the Earth there feelings must be awful. there are many more things I might speak of but time will not permit. There is many of the greatest things to take place in our day that has ever taken place on Earth are we prepared I think not I mourn over this people to see them so 
 stupid I feel that there hearts are more set upon the things of their farms than they are to prepare for the great day of the Lord. I pray the Lord to Bless us & give us his Holy spirit to prepare us for his kingdom & comeing for Christ sake Amenat 7 oclock in the evening the people again assembled & filled the House and they were addressed by W. Woodruff who said Brethren & Sisters I am truly glad to meet with you in the capacity of a quarterly conference & visit you as a mission I am truly thankful that I have a mission appointed me in con-nextion with Parley P & Orson Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for it is the first time since the organization of this church & Quorum that I have had this privilege of being associated together with those two men on a preaching mission ownly as we have met ain a conference from time to time to transact business as a Quo[ru]m I called them Apostles, is it true that they are apostles it is eith[er true]or false, if it false then your faith is vain your religion is vain you have not the Kingdom of God with you nor the priesthood with the blessings have you. but if you they are true Apostles then you have the kingdom of God with you the Priesthood & the keys of the kingdom of God & a presidency who hold the keys of the kingdom of God on the Earth & govern that kingdom for the benefit of the people then you are bound to listen to our words & teaching & to the teaching of the presidency of this Church. when I arived in this place I spent the night at Brother Steeds after I retired to rest I prayed to the Lord to show me what he wished me to teach to the people the spirit of the Lord said to me teach the people to obtain the Holy spirit that they may receive teaching then let the missionaries keep the spirit of the Lord withthem & that will constantly dictate them what to teach you have had a flood of light poured out upon you since the commencement of this conference & we should listen to it we should pay particular attention to our children & teach them good things & not permit them to spend their time in reading novels & filling their minds with fals hood & folly & things wharein there is no profit which will lead them asstray & make them fit subjects for destruction when this is the case through the parents neglect they will have to answer for that sin. The Bible Book of Mormon & Doctrins & Covenant should be read by our children instead of French novels & negro songs for whatever seed is sown in the minds of our children the same kind of fruit will be produced[rest of page blank]

Prayer by Thomas Grover & the People were addressed by Joseph Young & follo-wed by Erastus Snow & evry man during the conference spoke in the demonstration of the Holy GhostThe people were again assembled at 6 oclock & Prayerby Orson Pratt. W. Woodruff addressed the people & said that when I look upon the mountains & vallies & hills & dales & both in the Heavens & on Earth I behold a great variety in all the works of God & in looking upon the portr-ait of the Presidency & Twelve I see no two men or things look alike & what constitutes a part of the glory of God is the great variety of his works so in the preaching of the Presidency & Twelve each man might preach upon a different subject & Handle it in a different manner yet all by the same spirit & will edify the people. so I feel incouraged to think that notwithstanding such a great flood of light & truth has been presented to this people since the commencement of this conference that the Lord will still give me sumthing that mayedify the people this evening. I would warn the people to give heed to the strong teachings & exertations which they have 
 had presented to them during this conference this people should give themselves to the studying of the revelations of God as con-tained in the Bible book of Mormon & Doctrin & CovenantsSome have thought they should follow the living Oracles & neglect the study of all other Revelations but this is not so all men should follow & harken to the living Oracles of God but they should not neglect the study of the scriptures for God has commanded it and any man that will search the revelations of God thouroughly will be far better prepared to carry out the council of the living oracles at all timestheir is another subject that I wish to speak of & that is the principle of recording the dealings of God with us here on the Earth while all other prophets & Apostles record the dealings of God with them why should not the Elders of this last dispensation it is true that the Prophet Joseph wrote the History of the church in his day & that testiment is now gladdening the harets [hearts] of thousands while the testator is dead so with the Presidency of the Church who are now leading us they keep a History of the dealings of both God & man with them the History of which will be interesting to millions of future generations but does this excuse the many thousands of Elders & High priest & Apostles who have travelled for many years & built up this church & kingdom & had the gifts of the Holy Ghost with them so they have had power to heal the sick & cast out devils open the eyes of the blind unstop the ears of the deaf cause the lame to leap as an heart & commanded the Elements & they obey them. & have had guardian Angels to preserve them from Danger & Death I say shall the Elders be blessed with these things & not count them worth recording not even make the mark of a pen to leave the Account on record for their children & future generations to read I say they should. I think the Lord requires this at our hands & it is a Rich & Holy legacy which is Justly due our posterityAnd I do desire that the Elders of this church would keep a history & Journal of their lives I also wish that our young men would become acquainted with Phonography that we may have one thousand reporters whare we have one now that they may report the teachings of the servants of God & the work of God in this generation many other remarks I made to the people concerning the gathering of Israel & other subjects & was followed by Elder Orson Pratt the spirit & power of God rested us all during the conference I laid on hands upon a sick woman with Brother Orson PrattNovember 19, 1855 ~ Monday19th In company with Orson Pratt I administered to 2 of Bishop Stokers children who were sick with the mountain feverwe then returned to salt Lake city with Brother P.

O.

 [FIGURE] I followed Brother Farr the following is a synopsis of the remarks which I made. Brethren & sisters I count it a privilege to Join my Brethren in bearing my testimony of the things of God I have a feelings of solemnity resting upon my mind concerningour duties as a people this feelings is increasing upon me daily I can bear testimony that what brother Pratt has said is true The Lord has a meaning in sending the Apostles & Elders into the vineyard in this Territory to preach to the Saints, and I know as God lives that the same spirit that rested upon the Ancient Prophets before some great Event has rested upon the Ancient Apostles & Elders upon this mission the spirit of God has restedupon them to prophesy & teach great things in the name of the Lord. I feel that as Prophets, Apostles & Elders we have no time to sleep, slumber, & rest upon our lees & feel that we have nothing to do but eat, Drink, dance & be merry for I know there is a mighty responsibility resting upon us as a people & we have no time to loose or throw away if we do our duty to God to the Gentile Nations, to the whole House of Israel, to Zion & Jerrusalem, & are prepared ourselves for the great & mighty Events which are rushing upon us with the rapidity of lightning. Look at the House o David the tribe of Judah alone see the rivers of Blood which have run from their veins shed by the hands of the gentiles for the Last 1800 years by the hand of Evry gentile Nation under heaven their rivers of Blood have quenched the flames of their burning Temples synagogues & cities their treanches & Cities have been filled with their mangled bodies left unburied untill the stench has asscended up towards heaven from Generat-ion to Generation evry Gentile Nation have demanded tribute taxation of them beyong [beyond] Endurance & persecuted them unto death The old Jewish Rabbies & Priest have turned their faces tow-ards Gerrusalem for 1800 y[e]ars & cryed unto God in great sorrow & affliction. the God of Abraham has declared that the day should come when their afflictions should scease & they should be redeemed deliverd from the Gentile yoke redturn to Jerrusalem rebuild Jerrusalem & their Temple & have great blessings again given them by the hand of the God of their Fathers but for all these blessings He would be inquired of by the House of Israel to do int for them. The dawning of that day has come, thefulness of the Gentiles is fast coming in, the time has come for them to begin to go home to Jerrusalem but who is to ask for this blessing at the hand of God is it required at the hand of the Jews alone their is a veil ostill over them the kingdom of God is taken from ^them^ the Priesthood with its keys & powr is not within their reach by which they can rend the veil of Eternity in order to obtain thes blessings at the hand of the God of ther fathersthey have not a partical of faith in the name or blood of the son of God but they are doomed to go home & build their city in unbelief then at whose hands does the God of heaven require these things. It is at your hands O ye Latter Day Saints you are of the house of Israel linege of Joseph through the tribe of Ephraim your fathers have been mixed with the Gentiles & God has called you out & given unto you the kingdom with all its powers & Blessings He has given you the Holy Priesthood & taken the veil from off your eyes & you are the ownly people 
 under Heaven who now hold these blessings & know & see the things of God in the true light. Hence the Lord requires this people to call upon God day & night for the redemption of this branch of the House of Israel that his promises may be fulfilled concerning them. Inasmuch as we cannot do any thing for the Jews but give them our prayers we should not with hold that blessing from them. Again let us turn our thoughts to the Lamanites of who are of the linage of Joseph who surround us in these mountains & vallies who are also cursed & cast down below the brute creation there is also a thick dark veil still hanging over them the God of Joseph has said they should be redeemed & become a white & Delightsome people here the Lord requires sumthing els at our hands besides praying we have manual laborur & work to do we have them to redeem no body els will attempt it. our duties are great towards that people. we have carried the Gospel to the Gentiles Nations & they have rejected it & our own Nation has shed the best blood that rolls in the veins of men, they have slain the prophets & saints & driven the whole Church & kingdom of God into these mountains in the midst of the Lamanites here the ark of God rests shall we cover it up & let it rest idle I say no the Lord requires the salvation of this branch of the house of Israel at our hands. As Prophets, Apostles, Elder & Saints of God we have no time to loose or sleep upon our oars & wait for somebody els to perform the work. we have it to do & the time has come. I know the day is at our door when the worship of that people will be excepted at the hands of God they will be visited by the Holy messengers of God who will be coworkers with us then let us call upon God earnestly in their behalf & do our duty towards them & they will soon stand in Holy places & recieve the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood & appreciate them & do a great work which will be excepted of the Lord thes things are resting upon my mind with great wait day & night. If we as a people have fallen asleep it is time we awoke to our duty or we shall come under condemnation as a people who bear the Priesthood.I feel to give Brother Orson Pratt my heart & hand in Joining him in calling upon God that we may rend the veil that we may obtain greater Blessings from God. we must pray earnestly in order to obtain the Holy spirit. many other remarks were made which are not now written [FIGURE] I wrote a letter this morning to Mrs Woodruff & to my son Wilford & Daughter Phebe which I sent by Mr Babbit who started for the salt Lake City he felt better this morning & did not take away the funds belonging to the Legislature as he threatened he wouldDecember 13, 1855 ~ Thursday13th I met with the Legislative counsel we adjourned untill monday to give the committies time to bring in business & the carpenters time to finish the roomDecember 14, 1855 ~ Friday14th I spent the day reading & writing I attended the meeting during the evening. The meeting was addressed by Phineas Young who spoke of the Lamanites said He had distributed the Books of 
 mormon to the various Indians Chiefs from the Cherekees to Florida He gave Ross the Cherikee chief one he made many remarks upon that subject. He made one Error in saying that the Indians would not imbrace the work of God or be gathered by the Gospel untill they had gone through among the Gentiles & trodden them down as the Book of mormon declairs. But the book of Morm-on declairs that they shall be gatheredHe was followed by Lorenzo Snow & Samuel Richards both spoke much to the Edification of the PeopleDecember 15, 1855 ~ Saturday15th [FIGURE] I wrote 7 letters to my family to Mrs Woodruff to Phebe, Susan, Bulah, Moroni Emma & Sarah which I sent By mail. I spent the afternoon on a committyon EducationDecember 16, 1855 ~ Sunday16th Sunday [FIGURE] the mail came in to day & brought me a letter from Mrs Woodruff. P. P. Pratt Preached to the People in the forenoon upon the practical duties of lifebut I was at home writing. President Young Preached in the afternoon & I reported his sermon the following is a synopsis of the samePresident Youngs text was Arise & shine O Zion for ^thy light is come^ & the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. He said I have always felt since I have been called to preach to speak of the practical things of evry day life instead of some great misteries a long way ahead in tEtearnity which the people do not know nor never will as the thing tought does not exhist I felt in the begining of my being called to the ministry that I had no right to preach except I was filled with the spirit of Revelation & prophesy as the Ancients & I feel the same to day in order to be qualified to preached we should be filled with Reve-lation I do not consider that any man is qualified to preach the Gospel & the sayings of the prophets unless he is filled with the spirits of the prophets. We are commanded to arise & shine but for us to sit down & say that we believe in this work we believe that ^Joseph^ was a Prophet, and still not carry out thework which we are commanded to do, not to build up or beautify Zion we shall find that we shall miss of our aim we shall not enter into the Celestial kingdom we shall not enter through the gates. We must show to the Lord that we are willing to fulfill What he requires of us and this we shall not do unless we are willing to arise & shine, but how are we to [do] it, we have got to build up Zion, and we have got to make Zion the most holy and polished, Refined & beautiful place upon the face of the whole Earth. So we mayexpect to see Zion in all that beauty majesty & glory which God has spoken of. But the people do not understand the things of God. I will prophesy that unless this people will rise up & build up Zion as God has commanded them they will be removed out of their place & another people will be raised in their stead who will perform the work & this I say in the name of God. I also say in the name of the Lord that the desendants of Ephraim who are among the Gentiles 
 are the first born and they are the first ones to receive th[e]fulness of the Gentiles gospel in this dispensation they are the firstto be gathered together and this work was not to be given toany other in the begining of this kingdom, this has been done.the Ephraimites are before me here to day. Now if I was to ask you if you are willing to do as you are told you would say yes. But let me tell you ther is not one of you thatare willing to do as you are told. I have given the peoplecouncil for years past how to build their forts, walls, Cities Houses, & how to begin to beautify & adorn Zion but have the people done as I have told them in these things, no. You may say these are of miner consequences. But let metel you that if you are not willing to do the small things thatis necessary ^on earth^ then you are not willing to do as you are told in heaven. & you will loose your glory and exhaltationNow do you not remember that I told you years ago to go to& build up a beautiful city in this place but there has been nothing done towards it. we have many that have been in the Church for quite a number of years & yet we havenot a Builder or Architect that knows enough to build the meanest house of any kind not even a kitchen inthe New Jerrusalem. Then how can we build up the New Jerrusalem? I have told the people all the day longto be prepared to build up this city. And I will say thatif we could take all the knowledge that exhists among evry nation upon the face of the whole Earth & boil it down into an essenc & put it all into one man He would not knowenough to lay the first stone in the wall around the NewJerrusalem to say nothing about building the city & Templewe have got to improve continually and build up goodcities & adorn & beautify Zion and let me tel you that if you do not come to thisat place ^whare^ you will not stand setyour heart on any riches or gold you are not worthy todo the work of God, and if this people do not build upZion they will be moved out of their place. evry time we build a House or city we should better it, evry thing aroundus should be neat & clean. now look at this building fora school house. the ground around this building should be prepared for a play ground, & kept neat & Clean & prep[ar]ed so as to make the child Happy. Children should be in a clean plase but how is it here. the moment the children step outof door they see nothing but filth all the day long. the minds of our children while young are pure & they should not spend their time in filthy places for it affects their minds & feelings they should be in a clean place, forthey are visited by the Angels of God but parents do notrealize this although it is true. Yo[u] may say I do not have time to keep my dwellings, school Houses, door yards &cclean, no nor you never will have till you die upon the same principle, but you should take time. now it should not takea week till I would clean out my door Yard. But the people in this Territory have not had time to cleanout their door yards, or to make any thing els they oughtto do. I will show you that I will set an example for 
 my children to follow, I will teach those things which weought to do to day. I have preached this doctrin from thebegining the first time I ever preached was to tell thepeople the duties of to day. now if you had all the gold inthe world what would you do would you go to calafornia Nobut go to & build up Zion. You may say their is no calafornia here we have no gold, but it is not gold that is going to bui[l]dup Zion though we shall use a good deal of it, but we have it to do with our hands.  You can make a begining & dosumthing, you can set an example, you can clean out your house & yard & make that clean, & you can stop the Bedbugs from runing around you. I do not see the first fruit or shade tree in this city. come up to the Salt Lake City & get some Fruit trees & set out & have some fruitgrowing. Now this is Zion and the light has come, & shinesupon you & you are call upon to build up Zion. How by goingto Calafornia No, for there is millions of Gold here & the Lordwill send it in sight when He thinks it is best ^for us to Have it^ as He did inCalafornia. If you think it is not best to come here go backto Missouri. Old Father Harris said that He would stayat Kanesville so when the church got ready to go backto Jackson County He would have but a short way to go [what]the people here wood, brother G. A. Smith told him He migh[t] Happen to find it much the nearest way there by the way of the Rocky moutains & many will find thatto be the case the longest way around will be the shor[t]est way there. we have been called great speculators & misersI have told the people I was the greatest miser & speculatorin the world, for I am laying plans to try to obtain evrything there is on Earth & in heaven that is good that iswhat I am after all the time. I have told the world that I would possess Heven while they would become servents toin thenext world. my speculations are not confined to this world aloneNow I say go to & make a fine house in this place. You maysay I have not the capitol. vary well look at the salt Lake Citywe have built up that city without capitol that was builtup with the strength of our hands which is our capitolNow I want to say to the people here what do you say togoing out on to your lots to build to build your houses & set out Fruits trees. Your wall around this fort is not much protection you might as well stick up a rowof willows to scare & stop the Indians as any thing thereis here. Now go to & build up some good Houses in thisplace I want to Join some 16 of the Brethren to come here & build up some houses & a wall around it. but I shall buildhumble here, I shall not build large, but I want you to lanchouth and then come & see Salt Lake City & If I have not beat you I will try again. I am determined to improve in allthe buildings I do while I live.  If we get our temple built I mean to go to work & build another one as much better thanthe one we are now building as this is better than the onethat we built in kirtland and this wing of the state Housewhich we have built here is a better building in its finish& structure than that temple was. Now go to & do what Godrequires of you. and what ever you want to get get lawfully 
 & then it will be a blessing to you allways & you will enjoy it. But steal it & it will be a curse to you & cause yousorrow & misery. Whenever I get so that I set myheart upon Houses, lands, Gold or any thing Els on earth so as to begin to turn my heart away from the Lord The Just want to die before that comes to pass day before that comes to pass I want the Lord to take me away. May God Blessyou AmenPresident Heber C Kimball followed & said I felt quite well in the forenoon but I do not feel well this afternoon in healt[h]I know what President Young has said is true we havecome here & we have Dedicated this people & this place toGod. Now do the people realize why we are here no they do not. we are here for the benefit of all Israel we have notcome here for a salary we have come here to do the w[ill] of God and I will say that the yoke is off from our neck& it shall never be put on again not on the necks of thispeople. for if we do not do as God wants us to do he will raise up a people that will do it. I tell you that God will smite anypeople that undertake to stop this work. And I say that what President Young has said is true you know thatwhat President Young has our children have to learn the Alphabet first. So it is with this people the thingswhich God teaches us are small & simple in many respectsbut they are just as necessary for us to learn & practice ias itis for the child to learn his letters in order to understandthe Arts & sciences for we have to learn & practice small things before we can obtain & carry out the greater thingsof God. Now we are required to begin to build up & adorn Zion we should set out fruit & shade trees I have not done as much as I would liked to have done, but I haveraised some 15 bushels of peaches. President Young has a large orchard he has raised a good many peaches & apples& some 10000 1000 lbs of Good grapes as good as I evertasted. And that is as hard a place to live as there isin these mountains. My wood for one fire cost mesome $175. These canyons are full of Good fruit whichyou can get & set out. I have several kinds of good currantswhich I got from the canyons which bear large & finefruit these things all help adorn the Earth, now goto & build up this place & make a beautiful city. you havea good place around the state house for a city & gardens& orchards the soil is sandy & you have a plenty of ma[n]ureto make it rich.The people must learn & practice clean-liness in this life some people think they can live alltheir days in filth & dirt never even wash their bodiesthen die & go to heaven & be clean but if you do notlearn & practice this lesson in this life you will have to learn& practice it in the next before you will be received into the societyof those who are clean pure & holy. you have got to bepassive in the hands of God. As the prophet has said ifwe are ^not^ passive in the hands of God as Clay is in the handsof the potter we shall have to be cut off from the whall& flung into the batch & ground over again before we 
 we can be made vessels of honour what can we be made vesselsof honour after we have moved in the hands of the potter & ground over again yes this will be the case with man but it is far better to be passive in the hands of God & be madea vessel of honor the first time than to wait thill till we have to be ground over again this is a figure which theprophet Jeremiahah made use of. Now President Young isthe Master Potter here on Earth & we should be subject to him in all things we should all remember that we have got to render up our stewardship to God therefore we should be faithful in all things. And I pray that the spirit of God may rest upon you that you may do right & be saved with a full salvation. And I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ AmenDecember 17, 1855 ~ MondayMonday 17 I spent the fore part of the day in the council & the after noon in Joint sessionDecember 18, 1855 ~ Tuesday18th I spent the fire [fore] part of the day in the counsel the afternoonin Joint session[FIGURES] I wrote 7 Letters to my family which I sent by BrotherPugh viz to Mrs Woodruff Wilford Phebe Susan BulahMoroni & EmmaDecember 19, 1855 ~ Wednesday19th I spent the day in the counsel the whole day was occupiedin debating the subject of the Education of our childrenDecember 20, 1855 ~ Thursday20th I spent the fore part of the day writing & the afternoon inthe council attending to the legislative businessDecember 21, 1855 ~ Friday21st I met in Joint session with the two houses to appoint acensus agent.

The President has said that it was necessary to send missionaries throughthis Territory to preach to the people in order to save themthis I believe is true we as a people have got to rise up & become sanctifyed pure & holy in order to be prepared to meetthe great events which are rushing upon us with the rapidity oflightning we have got to make up our minds whether wewill keep a Celestial Law or what Law we will keep. It isnecessary for us to send messengers of salvation to stir up theminds of the people as long as there can be found an Adulterer

He refered to the preach-ing of Orson Pratt & Orson Hyde the sabbath before upon the subj-ect of the resurrection. He said the Identical particles of matter in which we had honored our spirits with ie our tabernacles inwhich we had suffered, travelled, laboured, & built up the kingdom of God that would be the Identical body & no other that would be raised from the grave to immortality & Eternal life. Adam & Eve had lived upon another Earth were immortal when they came here Adam assisted in forming this Earth & agreed to fall when He came Here & He fell that man might be & the opposite principle to good the devel, the serpent, the Evil was plased upon the Earth that man might know the good from the Evil for without an Experi[en]ce in these things man could not know the one from the other as soon as the devil was on Earth He sowed the seeds of Death in evry thing so as soon as they began to eat of the fruit of the Earth they received into their system the seeds of mortality & of Death so their children wer mortal & subject to death sorrow pain & wo then when they partook of life, Joy, ease, & Happiness they would know how to prize it Father Adam would never scease his labours to redeem his posterity & exhalt them to all the glory they were capable of receiving He did not doubt but that Father Adam knew in the beginning how many of his posterity would receive a Celestial glory & who they were &also a Terrestrial & a Telestial yet man had his agency to act chuse & refuse good or evil as seemed him good & he would be rew-arded according to his works. O. Pratt asks will Adam or any God con-tinue to make worlds people them taste of Death to redeem them 
 Answer I have no doubt but ^it^ is his privilege but whether that He will do it is a question in my mind. How then can his seed increase to all Eternity, through the increase of his posterity.many other remarks were made by the PresidentMay 7, 1855 ~ MondayMonday 7th I bought 50 bushels of wheat at $100 & 900 lbs flour for $54.

Woodruff Also L. D. Young Gilbert Clements T D Brow & John Cook of the missionaries. The QuarterConference was opened by Prayer by O. Pratt. AfterSinging P. P. Pratt Addressed the People for 2 1/2 hoursEvry missionary present had a cold sore throat & was hoarse it had came on during the last 24 hours it was acomplaint that was quite universal among men women& children many hundreds were Attacked in the sameway there was no change in the weather nor any thingin the outward appearance of the Elements to cause it. Elder Prattwas quite unwell He said He did not intend to Preach this fornoonbut He had got to Preach or go to bed. He spoke in a vary interestingmanner for 2 1/2 hours upon the subject of the birth Life Death& resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text the 10 & 11 verses of the 2nd chapter of St Luke "And the Angel said unto themfear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great Joy which shallbe unto all people for unto you is born this day in the City of David 
 A Saviour which is Christ the Lord" This is the Saviour born in Bethlehem of Judea. He said one cause of his ^why I^ taking this tex[t]was ^is^ that a school teacher in Great Salt Lake City asked herwhole school if they would tell her whare Jesus was bornborn & not one of them could tell her it is true they were mostly small schollars but there was one almost a mangrown & he could not tell. I think there is a neglect among this people in not teaching their children as they should dothe Old & New testament the History of the Prophets & Jesus& the Apostles And I think it time to teach the people the simplethings of the word of God And this message of Good News isas necessary to this assembly as it was to the people of Judeawe and our children should read the Bible more than wedo at least Our children should read it untill they should learn whare Jesus Christ was born & understand hisHistory I wish to come down to the capacity of children& if they can understand me their Parents can. Perhaps almost evry child in these vallies at 8 years old know itis necessary to be baptized at that age because they havebeen taught it by their parents or others but many ofthem do not know what they are baptized for. But wasit not for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances & administrations would be in vain & of no Effect, forif we did not Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ our sins would not be remitted & if we did not lay on hands inhis name for the Holy Ghost or the Healing of the sick thecandidate would not receive the Holy Ghost nor the sick be Healedfor their is no other name given under Heaven wharebymen can be saved we have no promise of obtaining anyblessing from God except through & in his name. then it is vary important that we sh& our children should understand his life & History. some do not know whether He was bornin Asia or America. Jesus Christ told his deciples that He had other sheep which were not of this fold (those in Jerrusalem)He came to this continant desended from Heaven & stoodin the midst of a congregation of saints that were assembledto worship God but He was not born here but He preached the Gospel here after his death, and holding a three daysmeeting in Hell & preaching the gospel to the spirits in prison while his body lay in the tomb then rising from the tomb & asscending into heaven then He descended to this contin-ant in his immortal body & not ownly preached the Gospel here among the Nephites but chose twelve Apostles Here& taught many plain simple, Great & glorious things thewhole History of which you can read in the Book of mormonHe told the people He was Jesus Christ who was born in Jerrusalem & there crusified for the sins of the world. He told themHe had other sheep yet which were not of this Fold neither at Jerrusalem but were the lost sheep of the House of Israel Hemust also go & visit them & when we get the record of of theTen lost tribes of Israel we shall get an account of his visitamong them I want to Preach Jesus Christ to you this day 
 Plainness & simplicity for untill you receive the fulness of the gospelof Christ you arne not a proper candidate either for a fulness ofCelestial Glory or to become sons of Perdition. For those who havenot received a fulness of the Gospel & the Holy Ghost will not always remain in hell but be redeemed in the own due time of the Lord & receive some kind of a glory like the stars in comparison to the son but whare God & Christ & celestial saints dwell they cannot come worlds without End but those who have partaken ofthe fulness of the Gospel & the Holy Ghost & they deny the Lord& shed innocent Blood or give there consent thereto theycommit the unpardonable sin & there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come, and I wish you all to understand that if you are Baptized & receive the Holy Ghost& your Endowments & are sealed up unto Eternal life against all manner of sins & blasphemies except the against the sin ofthe Holy Ghost that mercy cannot rob Justice that after all this th if you commit any sin you will have to answer forit & pay for it in this life & if the sin is great Enough you will have to be destroyed in the Flesh & if necessary be deliverd over to the buffitings of satan untill the day of redemption & if yoursins are not unto death you may then come forth & be exhal-ted to glory Immortality & Eternal life but it is a greatdeal better not to sin at all. I want all the children thatare 8 years old & all young persons & all old people & strangersthat have not been baptized to come foreward & be baptized& also those who have commit sins for which they should be baptized for that they may begin to be candidats either for the fulness of Celestial Glory or sons of perdition. Many other interesting remarks were madeby the speaker but no one reporting they were not takenAt 3 oclock PM. Elder Gilbert Clements addressed the assembly He took for his text "examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith or no and said many may think they possess things which they do not possess & this may be the case with regard to their faith. do we feel as we once did I thinknot at least I can say that many are not as faithful asthey once were I look upon the saints as subject to a comp[le]t[e]warfare the question was asked anciently shall therebe faith on the Earth when the Lord comes. I know ofNo people on Earth that have to make greater exertionsto keep from being worldly minded than this people for we have been broaken up so many times & driven from place to place that we have had to labour night& day in order to live or to obtain the necessaries of lifebut in the midst of our labour do we remember ourprayers, do we pray three times a day but says one Ihave to go to the canyons to get wood & I have not time to stop to pray. But I can say I never knew a greatman in the Kingdom of God but what was a praying manDaniel was a great Prophet & business man yet He alwayfound time to pray 3 times a day & he even kept up this practicewhen He became prime minister of Babylon & presided overall the princes & business of that great kingdom what aglorious example for this people for let us have ever somuch to do we should never neglect our prayers 
 when I see a saint eat & lie down & sleep without praying I think that man is in the road to ruin. there is sufficientbefore our eyes to cause us to pray. I do not think there ever was a greater miracle than this people coming here& doing what they have done How has this been accomplishedby the faith of the faithful of this people & the blessings of theLord upon us. I have often wondered why so few out ofthe thousands who hear the testimony of the servants of God have received it & again why so few remain faithful to the end who do receive it. it is because they have lost their faith if they ever had any. we should not ownly have faith butworks & treasure up evry useful knowledge within our reach for I do not believe that the spirit of God will go out of his course to te[a]ch men those things which they are to lazy tolearn when they have the means within their reach. I know that this people can learn more in 3 months thanother people can in 12. He spoke of schools and the dutyof parents to children He said that the painter & artest presentedtheir paintings & sculpture which were preserved as thechoice monuments of art & greatness but mothers & teachers will make an impression upon the mind of youth which will last long after the painting is worn to threads & themarble crumbles to dust.At 7 oclock in the evening the People again assembled at the school House & were addressed by Elder T. D Brownaddressed the people. He said I am appointed a missionarbut in another part of the vineyard I felt a desire to cometo this place it does not seem but a short time since I begantravelling & preaching.

Woodruff President Young arose & said that as He did not expect to be able to speak to the people He had prepared a peace to be read before the assembly & when that is read I will say a few words. Thomas Bullock then read the address before the assembly. He sustained the con-stitution of the United States also its laws but He used a sharp two edged sword against wickedness & wicked men He sharply rebuked sin in high places. & when the address was finished He followed with a lengthy sharp cutting Oral Speech which was more pointed than his written document this speech was fully reported by the reportersThe meeting was addressed in the afternoon by Brother John Gibson followed by O Hyde & H.

 Him unto the office of the first Patriarch in the church & Kingdom of God. This blessing was sealed upon him as it belonged to him by right throug the linage of his Fathers it was recorded in the Historians office taken from the report of Thomas Bullock. At the close of this meeting I returned home & took most of my family & went to the 14 ward school house the house was filled to overflowing I went into the stand with the Bishop I felt as though I was full of fire I was full of that Electrickt fluid or spirit of God that had flown through President Young during the day there was no reporter to record my words, but the following is a synopsis of my remarks as far as I can recollectI arose & said I wam thankful for the privilege of meeting with you & to speak of the things of the Kingdom of God & to hear from my brethren. I have been full of thought& reflection this day while sitting & hearing from President Young, & I feel to thank God with all my heart that He has bestowed upon us such a leader in this dispensation yes president Young is a leader in Israel & one that is not ashamed to rebuke sin in high places He will guard well the interest & salvation of this People reguardless of all consequences & I feel it my duty as an Apostles of Jesus Christ & an Elder in Israel to sustain him in his office & back up ^his testimony^ by my faith & works & I also consider it the duty of evry Apostle Bishop, Elder, & officer & member in the Church of Jesus Christ to do the same if we are not willing to do it we are not worthy of the place we occupy. & when we know that sin wickedness & improper conduct exhist in any of our wards we should rebuke that evil & correct it in our ownhouses & wards & not leave it all for President Young to do. we have Evils in our own ward we have wicked men who will blaspheme the name of God & who are striving to destroy our wives & daughters. I have seen some of those same men come here to meeting & set & laugh me in the face all the while I was speaking & they will set & laugh the Bishop in the face while he is speaking this class of young men some of them are members of the church yet they will join with the wicked & come here to meeting & take a seat in the back part of the house & get together in a group & gather all the young women & girls around them they can & then conduct in a rediculous manner instead of paying attention to the preaching. that class of men should stay at home for while they conduct as they do I would rather have their room than their company. they are also useing evry exhertion to draw away our young women & girls to parties & would destroy them if they could. shall we sleep unconcerned as Elders & parents while these scenes are enacted around us no I will not do it & I feel to exhort this con-gregation to wake up & know what is going on around them & their families & not suffer your wives & daughters to mingle with Military officers soldiers, Horslers & cooks & gentils in balls parties rides & other amusements untill they are defiled 
 & destroyed it its much easier to keep your hands out of the fire than to cure them after they are burned. I would far prefer to bury any wife or child I have than to have them live to dishonor my name & disgrace themselves by commiting sin with the gentiles. If the Bishop sees any member of my family children or wives come hereto meeting & take a seat in the back part of the House & spend the time in play instead of attending to the preaching I wish him to call them by name & let them be reproved openly if they will take that course for they all know that that to be against my council & I wish the Bishop would pursue that course with all persons who come here & do not do right. we should not be ashamed or afraid to rebuke wickedness sin & abominations whence ever we know of their its existance in our midst. for by doing right we will ever be supported by the right hand of the Lord. there is not the least trembling in my boydy or spirit because of the results that myay arise from resisting & rebuking sin for I would rather die wifeless & childless & see my dwellings laid in ruins & my own body fall in the gap than to permit whordoms, wickedness & abominations to exhist in our families wards & cities unrebuked & unchecked for we as a people have to sanctify ourselves before the Lordin order to sanctify have the blessings & approbation of the Lord upon us. It will be far better for us to restrain our children from Evil than to suffer them to go headlong to ruin & they will thank God to all Eternity that there parents have given them good council & restrained them from Evil rather than to be permitted to plunge into misery sin sorrow & woe we should treat our wives & children with kindness & affection & give them good council & when we have done all we can for them then if they will do ^w^rong & go to ruin our gar-ments are clear & I hope from this time forth that we may not look upon sin with any degree of allowance of approbation which may God grant for Christ AmenI was followed in my remarks by Bishop Hoagland Phineas Richards Joseph Horn & Samuel Richards all backed up my testimony. the spirit of the Lord rested upon us & we had a good timeFebruary 19, 1855 ~ Monday19th I spent a part of the day in the Historians office & the evening in the Grammar school.February 20, 1855 ~ Tuesday20th I spent the day at home studying English Grammar we had a snow stormFebruary 21, 1855 ~ Wednesday21st I spent most of the day studying & the evening in Grammar schoolFebruary 22, 1855 ~ Thursday22nd I spent part of the day studying.

President YoungAddressed the People I was not in at the comm[encem]ent & had no chance of reporting his discourse the following is a key to his address which I have to write from memoryI do not wish to spend my time neither is it profit[ably]for any man to spend his time in telling the peoplewhat was done in the days of Adam, Enoch & Noahthousands of years ago or what will be done inthe malinum thousands of years hence but my businessis to tell the people what they should do to day in orderto be saved this is my doctrin all the time. Whatcan I do or this people do this day in any one thing inorder to help build up the kingdom of God or to advanceone step further towards ^the^ salvation of ourselves or ourbrethren. Now what has been the counsel to this people throughout this Territory for several years it hasbeen to Fort up, to wall in your cities with strongwalls, this has been the voice of the Lord unto themall the day long have the people listened to this voicehave they carried out this counsel No they have notbut what have they done. they have been readyto say what need hath the Lord of this thing, do youthink there is any danger of the Indians. do you thinkthat Brother Brigham really believes that it is necessaryto go to so much expens in building walls around ourcities. Instead of going to work & doing what they are told to do the people spend their time in talking aboutit & trying to evade it.Now I wish to ask a question. The Lord has appointed me to lead this people the people has chosen me as theirleader & covenanted to sustain me & obey my counselNow if I tell the people what to do & they do not doit nor carry out my counsel, but turn from it& go to work & do sumthing els & they continue this year after year while at the same time I amwarning them of the danger of their Course 
 & telling them of the Judgments that will come upon them if they do not alter their cours & go to work & do as I have told told the[m] do you suppose they will escape the chastening rod of the Almighty No they will not if the people continue to persue this course & the chastening rod does not fall upon their heads I should become disgraced in the sight of God Angels & men. this people may rest assured thatthey are preparing a rod for their backs if theydo not listen to my counsel & do what I tellthem. but says one I would go to work &help build a wall around the City if I knew it was a revelation from God & that it was his will that we should do it. I want to say to such that it is my will that you should do it& that is enough I am responsible for it & ifyou want to know any further about it doright pray unto the Lord & have faith beforehim that you may have visions & revelations from God tso that you may understand the truth & know what lies before us as I do, thenyou will not question the reasonableness of thesethings but go to work & do them with all your mightMy teaching is to tell the people what to do to be saved today for if you get out of the path of salvation todayyou are in danger of being out of it tomorrow & the further you stray from it the more difficultyyou will meet with in ever finding it again. it would be folly in me to spend my time in telling the peopleabout the glories of the Millennium while I see them straying from those paths that would lead to those gloriesnow many of this people will say I have fine farms, Horses, Cattlegoods gold & riches the possesser says I look upon them I saythes are mine & at the same time you do not once even think that there is not one thing in your possession that is youres thatit all belongs to God & even you yourself belongs to God & all youhave belongs to Him & He has ownly loaned it to you & yet you do not acknowlede his hand in any thing while you shouldacknowledge his hand in all things.I know what the design of the Lord is in leading this people to this place & his design concerning Israel and it is none of your business what I coun-sel you to do it is your business to go to work & do it. leave theevent with God I want this people to build their forts as I tell them & when you have built this fort & made a wall6 feet thick & 12 feet high & get comfortable in your houses then go to work & build one on the outside of it 12 feet thick & runthem both up together 25 feet high & keep building untill I tell you to stop. & be in a situation that you may shut up your gates & lie down & sleep in safety with your wives & childr[e]nmany other interesting remarks were made by President Youngupon this occasion which I am not able to record 
 May 5, 1854 ~ FridayMay 5th Friday we left Union fort rode to dry creek settle[men]tmade a short halt then drove to the American fork. 25 miles& spent the night the ^people^ Assembled for a meeting I was calledupon to address the people the following is a key to the remarkswhich I made. I said to the people that I should confine myremarks to those things that immediately consern us you have[been] counselled to build forths & wall in your cities with strong walls for several years throughout this Territory but the peoplehave not done it the[y] have vary slow to harken to the counsel of the servants of God from the begining even in thedays of Joseph all the people were ready to acknowledge he was a profit & looked to him to receive salvationsat his hands & was ready to have him controll them in allmatters appertaining to what the people termed spiritualthings but if He wanted $100 dollars in money He would have to Employ all the Twelve & mortgage his farm in order toget it the traditions of the people were so strong that they could not bear the Idea of having a Prophet dictate their tem-poral affairs but I wish to ask a question which is themost important to you A part in the first resurrection in exaltation & glory in the Celestial Kingdom of God with allits attendant blessings or a few Horses Cattle gold & goods Judgeye then why should it be thought a thing incredible or unjstunjust for a profit of God who is called to guide & controll us inall the weighty matters that consern us should also counsel us in those lesser matters of every day life now go to & buildyour wall around your city as you have been commanded to do & the blessings of God will rest upon you but if you refuse to follow the counsel given there is a rod preparing for you & it will be but a short time before you will see the handof God visible in the counsel that has been given to this peoplein building strong walls around these Cities many otherremarks was made but not here recordedPresident Kimball followed & said that what BrotherWoodruff had said was true his words are true. President Young comes here to visit the people & tell them what He wantsdone He has sent men to you also to tell you what to do & that is the same as though he had been with you himself you havegot to follow his counsel. And you have to fulfill your covenants which you made at the waters of Baptism we must not forget God. He intends we shall do that which we ought to do whenGod tels us to do any thing we should go to work & do it willinglyI am telling what is our duty. many often want to Jumpover under officers so as to get to President Young I havelived in the days of Joseph & in the days of President Young & I have always obayed those men for they were placed over meto obey them it is the duty of this people to obey their lead-ers it is the duty of my family to obey me I have no misteriesto give you for I have none but my business is to teach youthe truth well you are told to make a wall around your Cityand you have it to do. you read in the Book of mormon thatthe people had to wall in their cities in ancient days we have it to do in our day you have to become one or you are not the Lords 
 you are a good people but their is great room for imp-rovement in this city. the last one that we visited.I would like to see this people in good houses & gardens & in good forts.now when you come to the conference you all vote to sustain President Young now you have got to honour this man he holds the [FIGURE] of the Kingdom of God and sustain him or the Lord will not save & exhaltyou in his kingdom. I pray that you may do right & serve the Lord I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ AmenPresident Young arose and said I am willing to say a fewwords. If the Latter Day Saints cannot become one hart & mind & work in their temporal things which they dounderstand they cannot become one in Eternal things whichthey cannot understand. If you would too [do] as you are told then all would be right when the Lord requires any thing at your hands dont ask any questions but go to & do asyou are counselled to do you may ask is their any dangerof the Indians you do not always know what danger youare in but always do as you are told & then you are safeMay 6, 1854 ~ SaturdaySaturday 6th Rode to ^Battle Creek 3 mils^ provo 12 mils spent theSabbath and held a meeting with the peopleSunda President Young arose & said that I am not in the habit of taking a text but I will now takefor my text the last line that was sung "God is his own interpetor" He will make all things plain but do thepeople understand those things which are for our goodthe Lord will not explain all things unto us whe understands but he will make his people walk by faith He will not explain all his mistaries to the people. we read in the New Testament that faith is the assurance of things hoped for & the evidence of things not seen have we all got faith it is our duty to have faith in God & his word & promisesyou have to trust in God. He will not reveal all things u[n]to us some men are tried will the counsel given & will not obey they will not have glory in the kingdom ofGod they are bastards & not sons the Lord intendsfor the people to be tried so as to prove the faithfulWhat God does reveal He reveals for the purpose ofleading men in the way of salvation the people do notknow the way of the Lord they come here andsay I am going to build myself up I have to work so hardI cannot get time to pray but are you doing right when you do this we may labour to get all things abot us yetthe Lord will controll it as seemath him good. If youget into the dark still hold on to the work of God no matterif I dont fell like praying I will do it if the Lord shouldopen the visions of the minds of the people that have gone to Calafornia so that they could see things as they are theywould as soon cut their throats as to have done it but they dont see it they have to go and suffer untill they aresatisfied I will say the same to this people if we do not 
 do the things which god requires of us we shall be whiped till we are sore this is the ownly thing that will save us I nowtell you that those that are gone & going to Calafornia withoutcounsel will ketch it till they are sore I know the truth but I cann-ot tell it all to you untill God permits me to do it now if you havenot confidence in me to follow me & believe that I am doing right drop me and appoint another & I will follow in the wake.In the begining of this work God tried to get this people to beone but they would not be one. I will now tell you what to doGod intends to make you one you must be one & their must be a begining to this and you must begin in small things like childr[en]making Cob Houses the people went to Missouri & there they quarrelled about many small matters then God said I will throw dow[n] their good houses & God d^D^roved all the people out & they thoughtthey were knocked into pi[eces] [ink change] did they do any better then, no they did not,God tries the people both in riches & with poverty. if I will be faithful in my poverty I willown all riches that is needful. now if God wants us to be of one heart & one mind. now hemay have no ^other^ motive in view than to make us work together he will tell us to build fences &forts that our feelings & interest may be united in something. now will you do it? we are requiredto become of one heart & mind & work together in those little things that we do understandor else we could not be prepared to work together and be one in those eternal things which wedo not understand therefore we could not enter into the kingdom of God. it is nothing but thepower of God that has preserved this settlement. the Indians could have killed every manwoman & child here, & not a man had a gun ready to defend himself. when you havebecome of one heart & mind he has treasures for you & has given us capacity to see if wewill magnify our calling with every thing we have to do in our lives. we are approachingvery swiftly the time when Jesus will come to see if we are of one heart & mind which theProphet Joseph said would be in this generation & will manifest himself to the Saints & takeup his abode with him. this was said 24 years ago & in 26 years more if we r not preparedto meet Jesus & angels we shall be wiped out & sent to hell. we r fast approaching the timeI do not care what was done in the morning of creation or the days of Noah. I want to knowwhat this people will do. will you be Saints & live your religion & magnify your callings in the ChurchI will now tell this people what they should do. I will tell the Bishop in the presence of the peoplewhat to do. Bishop I tell you, go & start this wall & build it 6 feet thick & 12 or 14 feet highshut up every gate except two & then you can lay down in safety & an enemy cannot comeupon you. if this is not the will of the Lord I do know it is my will & you should not question any further. God wants it done & I want it done & dont stop until you are secured & that is enoughyour stacks have been so placed that one Indian could fire all this place & others shoot you downwhile you are fighting the fire. what if the people in Jackson Co had been good & been sanctified what would have been the situation of the people. why, the liars & goats would have had their headscut off but the wheat & tares had to be transplanted together in the wilderness. it was not the act of Joseph that caused the removal of this people. it is the people that govern & control which is thedemocracy of heaven. the democracy of earth is division and mark it, there will be a divisionhere before long among this people. now if you will all do right & live a holy life angels will come& visit us & sta[y] with us all night & you will have many revelations & be happy. we know we oughtto pra[y] & would not neglect it, if we loved the Lord. you may do just as you have a mind towhen I am gone but I beg & beseech of you to do right. I want you to build a strong wall & be safe so that whatever comes along you may be secure & bar your gates & be careful & dont let thedevil reign in you & all will be right & God bless you & I bless you. let us be ^of^ one heart & mindin the things that we do comprehend & then we shall be one in things we shall hereafter know.President H C Kimball it is not my place [ink change] to get up to reveal any thing for it is the head to conveyit to the body. but it is for me to carry out his designs & do his will for when I do the will of President Young I do the will of God & no man can get salvation unless he keeps his councilit is his will that the City should be walled & fortified & that is my will, when I do just 
 as he tells me I do the will of my Father in Heaven for he is the only man that holdsthe keys of salvation. when I feel reluctant to do his will I feel bad & so do you all. whenI do his will I can sleep in peace & my heart is consoled all the day long. this is alsothe case with you when you do not do as your Bishop tells you. last year your improvementswere all scattered about but now you are got into a smashed suckertash pie. now go to &save yourselves against all selfishness. I am going to put my property & all my wivesinto the Church & then nothing can be taken out of the Church. I am going to dedicate all I have to God. when a man turns away from the Priesthood he forfeits every thingeven his life for that is no longer his. my body is only lent to me by the Lord and I forfeit every thing when I go astray. if righteousness was laid to the line it would take many heads from their shoulders & the day will be when that will be done[ink change] now do as your bishop tells you & not go to salt Lake to President Young to alter this or that Ipray that this people may do right for when you dishon[o]rthe priesthood you dishonor God I have been told that some have said that I will honor the priesthood but I will not honor him that holds the priesthoodbut I say that you cannot honor one without honoringthe other.

 WILLFORD WOODRUFFSJOURNAL FOR 1854 
 January 1, 1854 ~ SundayJAN 1st 1854. Sunday I attended meeting atthe Tabernacle the people were addressed in an inter-esting & ediyfying manner in the morning By ElderOrson Hyde. In the afternoon by Elder Wilford Woodruff & Followed By Preseident Brigham Young. He spoke as He always does much to the edifycation of the PeopleJanuary 2, 1854 ~ Monday2nd ^[FIGURE]^ I delivered an address to the inhabitants of the 14thward ^at the^ school House was followed by several others in the fore part of the day I attended a party in the evening at the Social Hall time was mostly spentin music & danceing we had However an interestingaddress from President Young on the subject of danceingHe said I consider this a suitable place to give some instruction.  we have assembled here to have music & danceingthe world have had vary strange Ideas concerning these thingsthey have supposed it was a vary wicked thing for a Christ[ian]to dance or hear music many preachers of the day havesaid that fidling & music hCame from Hell But I say thattheir is no fiddleing or music in hell their is not a fiddler inhell or any music of any kind music belongs in heavento cheer God, Angel, & man, if we could hear the music their is in heaven it would overwhelm mortal man theLord gave us that organ that makes music so delightful toman & the Devel has stolen musick & many other thingsthat was ordained of God for the Benefit of man & hasturned it to an evil use but music & danceing is for the benef[it]of the Holy ones & if those that come here to night arenot Holy & righteous & feel to worship & Praise God they have no business here what strange Idea the world hasof a prophet they would expect to see a man with fingerna^i^les a foot long with his hair hanging to his hips, withhis body covered with dirt & filth with his head boweddown in sorrow for the sins of the world that He would not have a house or lie in one, or in a bed, but lie in the caves ofthe rocks & on the Ground & must never smile or appearhappy. And as to seeing an Apostles the people would expect to melt if one came along. But all of theseIdeas are vain & foolish for this company before meto night does not begin to be adorned inside or out asthey should be in order to meet with the Angels in heaven whoare adorned in purity power & Glory clothed with cleanwhite linen. I will say a word concerning danceing with theGentiles. As I have got up this party If I had felt disposedto have invited some Gentiles here would they havecontaminated me or this company No because thepriesthood rules here with the keys of power truth light& knowledge. And I would not suffer any thing thatis rong for I would controlls things & have them my own way or break up the party. But if any Elder in thischurch was to follow after Gentile parties they wouldsubmit themselves to their spirit partake of their evils& go to the devel any Elder would fall that persued thiscourse 
 why do not the Gentile merchants of this City embracedthis work because they have locked b[o]arded & boltedtheir minds against it with evry lock they couldput on. They swore by evry power they possess beforethey left home they would not embrace it they camewith but one object & that was to gain money & theyare determined not to be turned from their purposemany good remarks were made by the presidentI tarried at the party untill 12 oclok & then returnedhomeJanuary 3, 1854 ~ Tuesday3rd I spent the fore part of the day at home writingJanuary 4, 1854 ~ Wednesday to January 7, 1854 ~ Saturday4th to 7th I spent the time at the LegislatureJanuary 8, 1854 ~ Sunday8th Sunday I attended a meeting Lorenzo^in^ Far preachedI reported his sermonJanuary 9, 1854 ~ Monday to January 14, 1854 ~ Saturday9th to 14 I spent this week in the Legislatur the mailcame in this week I received a Letter fromSister William Benbow & a paper from O.PrattJanuary 15, 1854 ~ Sunday15th Sunday we have 8 inches of snow on the groundthis morning I spent the day at home.January 16, 1854 ~ Monday to January 20, 1854 ~ Friday16 to 20th I spent this week in the Legislature which closedon this 20 day of Jan 1854January 21, 1854 ~ Saturday21st I commenced a school this morning in my family with my own childrenJanuary 22, 1854 ~ Sunday22nd ^[FIGURE]^ I attended meeting at the Tabernacle & I preachedin the morning to the saints from the following words"whatsoever ye sow that shall you reap" I told the peoplethat if they sowed good principles in their own minds& in the minds of their children that they will bringforth good fruit which will tend to exhaltation & glory so can we judge of the nations of the Earth if they indulgein sin wickedness & abominations & their Children arebrought up in the same they must expect to reap the whirlwind arrow & death, Judgment sorrow wo &destruction.
