July 26, 1860 ~ Thursday   26 I went down into the field I moved Susan Cornelia down to  the farm house, it rained hard for two hours which was vary seasonable for the crops.    ENDENTRY July 27, 1860 ~ Friday   27 I called upon President Young in the forenoon all the Presidency were in the office. President Young read me a letter from Bishop  Maughn stating that there had been a fracas with the Indian  the Brethren had taken a one eyed Indian prisioner for stealing  and several Indians came down to liberate him the Indian started  to run and the guard shot him dead the other Indians shot at the guard and killed a Brother Samuel Cousins  through the lungs, the Indians then took to the mountains and found  two Merrils getting wood they shot Ira Elias Merrill dead and his  Brother badly wounded they took some Indians prisioners the rest gathered their forces and came down to liberate them and they  met 100 rifles they then held a council the Indians then agreed to go and get those who had shot the white men and bring them in and put them to death and make pease I spent the day in the office    ENDENTRY July 28, 1860 ~ Saturday   28 A plesant morning I spent the day in the offices the forenoon with  President R. L. Campbell. A Carrington  read the conference minutes and a sermon of President Young delivered  at the conference in Nauvoo Oct 1844. The minutes of this sermon  was compiled or written and furnished by Wm Clayton which done  great injustice to the subject. President Young gave a vary interesting  and instructive discourse upon the organization of the Church the power of the priesthood the authority and duties of the various Quorums from  the deacon to the presidency But Brother Clayton in reporting it gave a small portion of the sermon in detached sentences which gave an  Entire different meaning from what was intended Hence President   ENDENTRY 27th ^1860^ millions of years before our God was he also had to occupy an Earth like ourselves and we shall find it out at some period and this  is all the mystery there is about it and if we are faithful we in  our turn shall be Exalted and become Gods, and there will be no miystery about it when we understand it   O Hyde said I am satisfied that I have used a good deal of Philosiphy whis is not true but that is all done away with, and I did not think I should meet with the Prejudices of Potawatamie here to night President Young said if you bring Potawatamie with you you must expect to meet it. O Hyde said that he did not preach in Grants- ville as Brother Joseph Young reported he did Brother Joseph was  not Present and he has been misinformed concerning it E. T. Benson  Explained the way O Hyde did preach He compaired the reseurrection to taking a Journey around the world we travel all day stop at a  station at night lie down and sleep at night arise in the morning and continue our Journey through another day and so on. So at the End of this life we sleep in the grave till the morning of the resurre- ction we then arise and continue our Journey. Brother Benson  also said I do not preach things which I do not know I keep in shallow water I wish to teach the people those things which they can understand, and those things we cannot understand I do  not trouble myself about, I know it is my duty to sustain the president of this Church if I do not respect the President of this Church and belie his word and I set my self up against him I am under condem nation I would as lives cut off my right Hand, if he speaks to us we must believe him and obey him. I mean to do it.   Erastus Snow said President Young has put words in my mouth so that I can convey what I want. we are apt to say many things which we do not mean and we injure ourselves. I cannot see things in the same light that Orson Pratt does but when President Young has taught doctrin it has always tasted good to me. I do not wish to know any more than God wishes me to.   Orson Pratt said I will speak upon this subject I have not spoaken but once in the Tabernacle since conference I then spoke upon the revelations in the Doctrins and Covenants concerning the Father and son and their atributes I spoke upon those attributes of the Father and son I spoke of the Attributes of the Saints I gave my views upon the attributes   ENDENTRY 27 ^1860^ of God I sincerly believed what I preached, how long I have believed this doctrin I do not know but it has been for years I have published it in the seer, I spoke of a plurality of Gods, in order to worship this God I said that I adored the atributes wharever I found them I was honest in this matter * I would not worship a god or Tabernacle that did not possess Atrtributs if I did I should worship Idols I have thaught this doctrin. Now the reson I worship the Father is because in him is combined the attributs if he had not those  attributs I would not worship him any more than I would this chair. I cannot see any difference between myself and President Young. If you had told me what you worshiped him for you would have told me somthing, but now I can see no difference between us. I wish to Explain Now Jesus said I am in the Father and the Father in me. Now I do not suppose that the Father is in the son and the Son in the Father in the Tabernacle, but in the spirit and Attributes, truth light power andc. we are told that the son repr- esents the Father in Attributs andc I called upon the Brethren to come  to this meeting to settel this But I must have somthing more than  a declaration of President Young to convince me I must have Evidence I am willing to take President Young as a guide in most things but  not in all. President Young does not profess to have revelations in all things. I am not to loose my agency I have said many things  which President Young says is Fals. I do not know how it is I count president Young Equal to Joseph Iand Joseph Equal to President Young I find things in Josephs Revelations  that govern me I would as liefer believes Joseph as Brigham. When Joseph teaches one thing and Brigham seems to teach another contrary to Joseph (I say seems to) I believe them as Joseph has spoken them and as the Apostle speaks of them I do not know God ownly tby his Atributes, and that God who has the most Atributes I worship, I worship but one God, and God does not dwell in me ownly by his Atributes I have spoken plainly I would rather not have spoken so plainly but I have No excuses to make President Young said I ought to make a confession But Orson Pratt is not a man to make a confession of that I do not Believe. I am not going to crawl to Brigham Young and act the Hypocrite and confess what I do ENDENTRY 27th ^1860^ not Believe I will be a free man. President Young condems my doctrin to be fals I do not believe them to be fals I believe President Young to be sincere in sayin that my doctrin is fals. I did not Believe the doctrin fals which I published in the Seer in England. it has been said we should let those things sleep. But you do not let them sleep If I had thought while in England that President Young worshiped a God without attributes I would not have written what I did   ((The above remark was an unkind cut in Orson Pratt he should not have said it)) But I do not believe it yet I will not act the Hypocrite it may cost me  my fellowship But I will stick to it if I die to night I would say O Lord God Almighty I believe what I say.   Elder John Taylor spoke at some length and tried to convince Orson Pratt of his Error. President Young said Orson Pratt has started out upon false premises to argue upon his foundation has been a fals one all the time and I will prove it false you have been like a mad stoubern Mule, and have taken a fals position in order to accuse me you have accused me of worshiping a stalk or stone or a dead Body without life or attributes you never herd such a doctrin taught by me or any leader of the Church it is as false as Hell and you will not hear the last of it soon. you know it is false Do we worship those attributes No we worship God because he has all those Attributes and is the dispensur of them and because he is our Father and our God. Orson Pratt puts down a lie to argue upon he has had fals ground all the time to night Thare never was a time or Eternity but what a God did exist, and a God that had children upon the same principle that children are now begotton, and I was begotton by the God I worship  who reigns in the heavens and I shall also in my turn reign as  a God and so will you   O Hyde said to O Pratt, My opinion is not worth as much to me  as my fellowship in this Church   President Young said Michael was a resurrected Being and he left Eloheem and kcame to this Earth and cwith an immortal Body and continued so till he partook of Earthly food and begat children who were mortal (keep this to yourselves) then they died. A Carrington spoke upon the subject a short time and made some useful remarks   President Young spoke upon the subject of O. Pratt laying dow fals principle to work upon That principle if carried out would place   ENDENTRY 27th ^1860^ us in a position that when a man got a fulness of the Attributs  of God they would have to worship themselves. But if we worship  God we worship him because he possesses all the Attributes and  dispenses them to the children of men all these Attributes are the  servants of God they serve his purposes and are at his command  President Young and said  Brother Joseph and he has withstood  Brother Brigham many times and he has done it to night  and it made my Blood chill, it is not for you to lead but to  be leadd by him. You have not the power to dictate but to be dictated  W. Woodruff arose and said Brother Orson Pratt I wish to ask you one or two questions, you see that the spirit  and doctrin which you possess ins entirely in a oposition to the First Presidency The Quorum of the Twelve, and all who are present this evening and  it chills the Blood in our veins to hear your words and feel your  spirit should not this be an Evidence to you that you are wrong  what would become of the Quorum of the Twelve if we all felt as you do  we should all go to Hell in a pile together. You say you are honest in the course you are pursueing, I wish to ask you if you was honest  when you said that if you had known that President Young  worshiped a God without life or Attributes that you would not have  written what you did (O Pratt said I will recall that) It was an insult  to President Young and the Holy Priesthood which he holds, evry man  in this room who has a particle of the spirit of God, knows that President  Young is a Prophet of God and that God sustains him and He has the  Holy Spirit and his doctrins are true, and that he is qualifyed to lead the people and he has explained evry thing so plain this evening  that a child can understand it, and yet it is no evidence to you, nothing  can make an impression upon you, no argument can reach your  understanding. But Brother Orson I have seen the day when you was in sorrow it was when you was cast out of your Quorum and out of the Church and that to in consequence of persueing the  same course you are this evening, then you could both see feel and understand, then argument could reach you when you saw your glory  and crown departing from you. I beg of you to reflect and not let your will carry you to Far in these things, it would be better for us  not to be able to cast up a single sum in adition and be humble before   ENDENTRY 27th ^1860^ the Lord than to have ever so much knowledge and permit that knowledge to lead us to destruction. There are but few men upon Earth upon  whom God has bestowed such gifts, qualifications and reasoning  powers as he has upon you, and he will hold you responsible for  the use you make of them, and you should not make a wreck of your salvation for contending for things which you do not understand  and I do feel at this advanced state of the Church, and late day  and with the information which you possess that neither you  nor your Brethren ought to be troubled with Fals doctrin Neither  should you cause your Brethren to listen to such a scene of things as we have herd to night or to insult the president of this Church as you have done, although you are unbending in your will to night the day is not far distant when you will be glad to bend to the president of this Chiurch and make reconciliation.  Testimony of those who have spoaken   Pratt had not got the C. C. Rich who  backed up the Testimony of the Twelve in saying that Orson  Pratt was wrong. E. T. Benson spoke upon the same subject and said if Brother Pratt had the confidence in President  Young which he ought to have he would Feel diferent if he had the confidence in his Brethren which he should have I know He  would feel different   President Young said I will tell you how I got along with Prophet  I did not do it, I then said I will leave the Prophet in the  hands of that God who called and ordained him to be a Prophet  He is not responsible to me and it is none of my business  what He does it is for me to follow and obey him. I wonce was ash amed of one thing which I did while in Zions Camp  I got a revelation that God excepted our offering I had the same thing revealed to me twice and that we should not go into Jackson Co.  I named this to some of the Brethren a day or two before Joseph  got a Revelation upon the same subject I felt ashamed that  I named it first, I knew whare we were going and I now  know that when we go to Jackson County we shall go from the west   ENDENTRY 27th ^1860^ and I will now tell you all and you may right it down that all my preaching by the Holy Ghost it is revelation. I told the  Brother Joseph that he had given us revelation enough to last us 20 years when that time is out I can give as good revelation  as their is in the Taylor said in one of his sermons that if we walk in the light of the Lord we should have revelations all the time." it is the light that is  within you no man can live his religion without living in  Revelation but I would never tell a revelation to the Church untill Joseph told it first. Joseph once told me to go to his own house  to attend a meeting with him he said that He would not go without me. I went and Hiram Preached upon the Bible Book of Mormon  and Covenants and said we must take them as our guide alone  he preached vary lengthy untill he nearly wearied the people out  when he closed Joseph told me to get up. I did so I took the Books  and piled them all up on top of Each other. I then said that I  would not give the ashes of a rye straw for all those books for my  salvation without the living oracles I should follow and obey  the living oracles for my salvation instead of any thing Els when  I got through Hyrum got up and made a confession for not  including the living Oracles.   It may be thought strange by the Brethren that I will still fello- wship Elder Pratt after what He has said, but I shall do it. I  amd determined to whip Brother Pratt into it and make him  work in the harvest. Orson Pratt said if I gratifyed my  feelings I had rather go into the canyon than to Preach I  have got to go to Young  said I will give you a mission in Tooleele to preach and send word  to the Bishop to get some men and draw up his wood Brother Pratt  has no busines in the canyon the Lord does not want him there  F D Richard Dismissed the meeting    ENDENTRY January 28, 1860 ~ Saturday   28th I spent the day in the office I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle  29Orson Pratt met with us he did not dress but said he wanted to be in  the Society of the Twelve.

Watt I also reported it. at the close of the meeting I in company with Presidents Young and Lorenzo Snow called upon President D. H. Wells who was fast recovering from his sickness while speaking of the Malays President Young said that He was of the opinion that the Malays were of the seed of Abraham they went to  those Islands the same as they came to this continent they are probably of Abrams promised seed. They have a cereimony to  marry for Eternity this principle shows that they obtained their traditions from Ancient Israel for the gentiles did not practice it and it has been handed down among them through many Generations untill the present time. The Malays are a vary war like people and proud   ENDENTRY March 4th ^1860^   and while in Battle rather than to be saved by one of there servants they  would perish they would not owe there lives to a slave. We see a great  varity ofand grade of intelligence. I see right here in the midst of this  people some who do not know their right hand from there left  I see people freequently People who do not appear to have any underst- anding they will also increas but they will be so far behind they  will never catch up, and they will never be any thing but serv- ants. Such may be saved and get a good place. President Young said I corrected O Pratt to day. I did not say to him that God would incres increase to all Eternity. But I said the moment that we say that God  knows all things comprehends all things and has a fulness of all that He  ever will obtain that moment Eternity ceases you put bounds to Eternity  space and matter and you make an End and stoping place to it. The people  or many say thay cannot understand thes things, this is true No man  can understand the things of Eternity And Brother Pratt and all  men should let the matter of the gods alone I do not understand these  things Neither does any man in the flesh and we should let them alone  some men profess infidelity but when they go into Eternity they will find all they see in this life upon the Earth is ownly a similitude of  what thay will find in the next world. In speaking of the subject  of faith He said we will find but little faith but a good deal of belief  every body has that for it is an inherant principle in all. I have laid hands upon people when I knew they would be healed at other  times I have laid hands upon people when I did not feel that  way and still they were healed. I once laid hands upon a sister  Lake when she said she had No faith I told her I did not care  whether she had or not for I had and I knew she would be  healed. I laid hands upon her and she was immiediately healed. I  dont know how it is or how faith comes ownly as the gift of God  I know No other way to get it.

How many of the children  of this people are Entitled to the Holy Priesthood and the Blessings  of Abraham all who are born after their parents have received  their Endowments and are sealed and all others will have to be adopted  to their parents. All who want the Blessings of Abram Jacob go and get your Endowments before you get  married. then all your children will be heirs to the  priesthood. their is no son has a right to the Priesthood  and heirship unless their parents had their Endowments  before they were born such must be adopted to their Parents or they have no right to the heirship. Let no youth  get married untill they get their Endowments and get sealed  at the Altar. If young men knew what was for their  good they would go hundreds of miles to get married right before they would do as many have. Our boys who are guided by a right hand will be mighty men ^of God^ in the  Earth. The Lord instituted Polygamy to raise up a royal Priesthood a kingdom of Priest, it is an institution of heaven all the blessings that are sealed upon us will do us no good unless we live for them {Remember son Wilford} The Lord has in store for his children  Every good thing the heart can desire in righteousness. The  Celestial kingdom will be on this Earth to us when we are  celestial with the Earth. The Earth when it fell went Millions  of miles from the presence of God and when it returns back it will  go millions of miles from its present position to whare it came  from. Whare is the Mechanic that has knowlede Enough to lay  the first cornor stone of the New Gerrusalem {God might reveal this to someone} Ancient Israel the seed of Abraham was not found worthy to keep the Melchezedeck Priesthood, what then is to be done. The Lord said I will in the Last days raise up a generation of  Men, a royal Priesthood who would come forth to redeem the death  of Israel as well as the Liveing. This is our work ye latter Day Saints. Then rise up ye Latter Day Saints of God and do the work of God required at your. The Lord Acknowledged Ancient Israel because they were the best there was, but there was not light Enough   ENDENTRY July 13 1865   to light one match. The breath of this people would sanctify the Camp of Israel as it was Anciently. And now I will say to all the people get  your Endowments and be sealed, then your children Will be legal heirs to the priesthood and Birth right if this is not the case with you your children will have to be sealed to you. Capt Hooper then spoke 5 minutes President Young then returned thanks to the people for their kindness to  him and his company. I do not feel worthy to receive the blessings that I Enjoy.

Now here is the Presidency and Twelve there is no two of them that look alike or preach alike, their minds  run in different channels yet they preach by the same spirit   ENDENTRY Sept 17 1865 There is not a Better or handsomer set of men to be found upon the Earth than they are. I am the most homely man  among them, so they let me say about what I am a mind to but if I get much out of the way, President Young is here to correct  me as it is his place to correct all the Errors of the Church. It is a hard Matter for the Lord to Esstablish his Church and kingdom upon an Earth whare the devil has power and dom- inion and reigns over the hearts of the children of men and it  would be an impossibility for the Lord to build up his kingdom upon this Earth if he could not get some element, even some of the children of men to work with him, and this has been the difficulty since the creation of the world, that the Devil has ruled over the hearts of the children of men to that degree that  the Lord could not find men Enough upon the Earth who would submit for the Lord to rule over them, and lead them sufficient to build up his kingdom to remain upon the Earth. Even in the days of Enoch the Lord had to take him and his company off from the  Earth because they could not live upon it. The Lord has now  set his hand one more for the Last time to Esstablish his kingdom upon the Earth to remain, to overcome the Devil and his works and subdue the Earth, and the Lord has decreed that this should be accomplished and the Lord has taken all the pains in his power to Accomplish it He has brought forth the best spirits that Ever dwelt in His presence, to come forth upon the Earth to work with him in the accomplishment of this work. Even Joseph Smith was retained  in the Heavens for seven thousands years to come forth in  this day to lay the foundation of this Church and kingdom to  be trown down no more forever, nor to be given in to the hands of  another people. The same is the case with the Presidency, Twelve and many others in this Church and kingdom and the Lord has sent his Angels to watch over them from the day they were  born untill now, to presevrve them from the power of the devil  who has sought there destruction from the beginning And we have visited the Nations of the Earth, for the last thirty years to gather together the seed of Ephraim, the best spirits that  dwell upon the Earth into these vallies of the Mountains to   ENDENTRY 1865 assist in esstablishing this great and last kingdom of our God upon the Earth to remain forever, and the Lord Almighty is inspiring his servants with the spirit of his work, and the Holy Priesthood, and is arming them with power to accom- plish his purposes upon the Earth. Joseph Smith was the promised seed to come forth to lay the foundation of the kingdom, see what he has Accomplished. He labored but 14 years, 2 Months, and 18 days from the time He first organized the Church of Christ upon the  Earth, then He sealed his Testimony with his blood and all his  Father's family died as Marters and will be crowned in the presence of God (Except William, if he had been a good man he would have   been in the spirit world with his family Fathers family long ago but he has not been fit to live or die) Joseph the Prophet during  his short labor laid the foundation of this great kingdom that  Daniel saw. ##Daniel 2:26-47## He organized the Church and Kingdom with a full  and complete organization, sent the gospel in its fullness and glory to the nations of the Earth, gathered tens of thousands of Saints built  Temples and founded cities, gave Endowments to the Twelve Apostles  Elders and Saints and sealed all the Keys of the kingdom of God upon The Brigham Young as there President. President Young is before you, look at him, he has the Appearance  of a Man about 40 years of Age, He is 64. He has travelled more  Miles, Attended More Meetings, Preached More sermons, delivered unto the people more of the word of the Lord, revelation blessings upon the heads of the  children of Men, United more in the Marriage Covenant,  Administered more of the ordinances of the House of God, Attended to more branches of business, had more wives, Raised up more children, created more recreation for the youth to keep them  out of the clutches of the devil, danced more cotilions, Built  more Temples, Tabernacles, Meeting Houses, School Houses, dwell- ings and made more improvements and done more for the salv- ation of Man, and the redemption of the Earth than any  man that Ever dwelt in flesh during the space of 30 years, He has brought more to pass and Accomplished more in  30 years than the Early patriarchs did in 500 years   ENDENTRY Sept 17, 1865 Why is all this, it is because the Lord is agoing to make a short  work on the Earth, in the last days, and cut his work short in righteous- ness. He is inspiring his servants with the power of God and the spirit of his work, and a desire to build up his kingdom and Mount Zion as Men have Never before been inspired. This great  and mighty work is put into your hands to perform ye saints  of latter days. No greater work can be given into the hands of Men in the flesh. Then rise up ye saints of God and do the work required of you and the Lord will work with you, sustain  you and redeem you and give you power to Accomplish all that has been promised through the Mouth of all the Holy Apostles and Prophets since the world began which may God grant for Christ sake Amen G A Smith Dismissed the Meeting    Afternoon Prayer By E D Woolley spok 27 Minutes Hess 4, G A Smith 15, Young spok 10 Minuts Blessed the people and dismissed    ENDENTRY September 18, 1865 ~ Monday   Sept 18.
