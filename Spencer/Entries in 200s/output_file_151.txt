L. Campbell. A Carrington  read the conference minutes and a sermon of President Young delivered  at the conference in Nauvoo Oct 1844. The minutes of this sermon  was compiled or written &amp; furnished by W great injustice to the subject. President Young gave a vary interesting  and instructive discourse upon the organization of the Church the power of the priesthood the authority &amp; duties of the various Quorums from  the deacon to the presidency But Brother Clayton in reporting it gave a small portion of the sermon in detached sentences which gave an  Entire different meaning from what was intended Hence President   ENDENTRY  millions of years before our God was he also had to occupy an Earth like ourselves and we shall find it out at some period and this  is all the mystery there is about it &amp; if we are faithful we in  our turn shall be Exalted and become Gods, and there will be no m    whis is not true but that is all done away with, and I did not think I should meet with the Prejudices of Potawatamie here to night President Young said if you bring Potawatamie with you you must expect to meet it. O Hyde said that he did not preach in Grants- ville as Brother Joseph Young reported he did Brother Joseph was  not Present and he has been misinformed concerning it E. T. Benson  Explained the way O Hyde did preach He compaired the res to taking a Journey around the world we travel all day stop at a  station at night lie down and sleep at night arise in the morning &amp; continue our Journey through another day &amp; so on. So at the End of this life we sleep in the grave till the morning of the resurre- ction we then arise and continue our Journey. Brother Benson  also said I do not preach things which I do not know I keep in shallow water I wish to teach the people those things which they can understand, and those things we cannot understand I do  not trouble myself about, I know it is my duty to sustain the president of this Church if I do not respect the President of this Church and belie his word and I set my self up against him I am under condem nation I would as lives cut off my right Hand, if he speaks to us we must believe him and obey him. I mean to do it.    so that I can convey what I want. we are apt to say many things which we do not mean &amp; we injure ourselves. I cannot see things in the same light that Orson Pratt does but when President Young has taught doctrin it has always tasted good to me. I do not wish to know any more than God wishes me to.    spoaken but once in the Tabernacle since conference I then spoke upon the revelations in the Doctrins &amp; Covenants concerning the Father &amp; son &amp; their atributes I spoke upon those attributes of the Father &amp; son I spoke of the Attributes of the Saints I gave my views upon the attributes   ENDENTRY  of God I sincerly believed what I preached, how long I have believed this doctrin I do not know but it has been for years I have published it in the seer, I spoke of a plurality of Gods, in order to worship this God I said that I adored the atributes wharever I found them I was honest in this matter * I would not worship a god or Tabernacle that did not possess At I have t is because in him is combined the attributs if he had not those  attributs I would not worship him any more than I would this chair. I cannot see any difference between myself and President Young. If you had told me what you worshiped him for you would have told me somthing, but now I can see no difference between us. I wish to Explain Now Jesus said I am in the Father &amp; the Father in me. Now I do not suppose that the Father is in the son &amp; the Son in the Father in the Tabernacle, but in the spirit and Attributes, truth light power &amp;c. we are told that the son repr- esents the Father in Attributs &amp;c I called upon the Brethren to come  to this meeting to settel this But I must have somthing more than  a declaration of President Young to convince me I must have Evidence I am willing to take President Young as a guide in most things but  not in  all things. I am not to loose my agency I have said many things  which President Young says is Fals. I do not know how it is I count president Young Equal to Joseph  to President Young I find things in Josephs Revelations  that govern me I would as lief Brigham. When Joseph teaches one thing &amp; Brigham seems to teach another contrary to Joseph (I say seems to) I believe them as Joseph has spoken them and as the Apostle speaks of them I do not know God ownly  that God who has the most Atributes I worship, I worship but one God, and God does not dwell in me ownly by his Atributes I have spoken plainly I would rather not have spoken so plainly but I have No excuses to make President Young said I ought to make a confession But Orson Pratt is not a man to make a confession of that I do not Believe. I am not going to crawl to Brigham Young and act the Hypocrite and confess what I do ENDENTRY  not Believe I will be a free man. President Young condems my doctrin to be fals I do not believe them to be fals I believe President Young to be sincere in sayin that my doctrin is fals. I did not Believe the doctrin fals which I published in the Seer in England. it has been said we should let those things sleep. But you do not let them sleep If I had thought while in England that President Young worshiped a God without attributes I would not have written what I did    But I do not believe it yet I will not act the Hypocrite it may cost me  my fellowship But I will stick to it if I die to night I would say O Lord God Almighty I believe what I say.    of his Error. President Young said Orson Pratt has started out upon false premises to argue upon his foundation has been a fals one all the time and I will prove it false you have been like a mad stoubern Mule, and have taken a fals position in order to accuse me you have accused me of worshiping a stalk or stone or a dead Body without life or attributes you never herd such a doctrin taught by me or any leader of the Church it is as false as Hell and you will not hear the last of it soon. you know it is false Do we worship those attributes No we worship God because he has all those Attributes and is the dispensur of them and because he is our Father &amp; our God. Orson Pratt puts down a lie to argue upon he has had fals ground all the time to night Thare never was a time or Eternity but what a God did exist, and a God that had children upon the same principle that children are now begotton, and I was begotton by the God I worship  who reigns in the heavens and I shall also in my turn reign as  a God &amp; so will you    as my fellowship in this Church    left Eloheem and  so till he partook of Earthly food and begat children who were mortal (keep this to yourselves) then they died. A Carrington spoke upon the subject a short time &amp; made some useful remarks    principle to work upon That principle if carried out would place   ENDENTRY  us in a position that when a man got a fulness of the Attributs  of God they would have to worship themselves. But if we worship  God we worship him because he possesses all the Attributes and  dispenses them to the children of men all these Attributes are the  servants of God they serve his purposes and are at his command   Brother Joseph and he has withstood  Brother Brigham many times and he has done it to night  and it made my Blood chill, it is not for you to lead but to  be le W.  I wish to ask you one or two questions, you see that the spirit  and doctrin which you possess i The Quorum of the Twelve, and all who are present this evening and  it chills the Blood in our veins to hear your words &amp; feel your  spirit should not this be an Evidence to you that you are wrong  what would become of the Quorum of the Twelve if we all felt as you do  we should all go to Hell in a pile together. You say you are honest in the course you are pursueing, I wish to ask you if you was honest  when you said that if you had known that President Young  worshiped a God without life or Attributes that you would not have  written what you did (O Pratt said I will recall that) It was an insult  to President Young and the Holy Priesthood which he holds, evry man  in this room who has a particle of the spirit of God, knows that President  Young is a Prophet of God and that God sustains him and He has the  Holy Spirit and his doctrins are true, and that he is qualifyed to lead the people and he has explained evry thing so plain this evening  that a child can understand it, and yet it is no evidence to you, nothing  can make an impression upon you, no argument can reach your  understanding. But Brother Orson I have seen the day when you was in sorrow it was when you was cast out of your Quorum and out of the Church and that to in consequence of persueing the  same course you are this evening, then you could both see feel &amp; understand, then argument could reach you when you saw your glory  and crown departing from you. I beg of you to reflect and not let your will carry you to Far in these things, it would be better for us  not to be able to cast up a single sum in adition and be humble before   ENDENTRY  the Lord than to have ever so much knowledge &amp; permit that knowledge to lead us to destruction. There are but few men upon Earth upon  whom God has bestowed such gifts, qualifications and reasoning  powers as he has upon you, and he will hold you responsible for  the use you make of them, and you should not make a wreck of your salvation for contending for things which you do not understand  and I do feel at this advanced state of the Church, and late day  and with the information which you possess that neither you  nor your Brethren ought to be troubled with Fals doctrin Neither  should you cause your Brethren to listen to such a scene of things as we have herd to night or to insult the president of this Church as you have done, although you are unbending in your will to night the day is not far distant when you will be glad to bend to the president of this Ch Testimony of those who have spoaken    not got the  backed up the Testimony of the Twelve in saying that Orson  Pratt was wrong. E. T. Benson spoke upon the same subject and said if Brother Pratt had the confidence in President  Young which he ought to have he would Feel diferent if he had the confidence in his Brethren which he should have I know He  would feel different    Prophet  I did not do it, I then said I will leave the Prophet in the  hands of that God who called and ordained him to be a Prophet  He is not responsible to me and it is none of my business  what He does it is for me to follow &amp; obey him. I  amed of one thing which I did while in Zions Camp  I got a revelation that God excepted our offering I had the same thing revealed to me twice &amp; that we should not go into Jackson Co.  I named this to some of the Brethren a day or two before Joseph  got a Revelation upon the same subject I felt ashamed that  I named it first, I knew whare we were going and I now  know that when we go to Jackson County we shall go from the west   ENDENTRY  and I will now tell you all and you may right it down that all my preaching by the Holy Ghost  Brother Joseph that he had given us revelation enough to last us 20 years when that time is out I can give as good revelation  as their is in the Taylor said in one of his sermons that if we walk in the light of the Lord we should have revelations all the time." it is the light that is  within you no man can live his religion without living in  Revelation but I would never tell a revelation to the Church untill Joseph told it first. Joseph once told me to go to his own house  to attend a meeting with him he said that He would not go without me. I went and Hiram Preached upon the Bible Book of Mormon  &amp; Covenants and said we must take them as our guide alone  he preached vary lengthy untill he nearly wearied the people out  when he closed Joseph told me to get up. I did so I took the Books  and piled them all up on top of Each other. I then said that I  would not give the ashes of a rye straw for all those books for my  salvation without the living oracles I should follow and obey  the living oracles for my salvation instead of any thing Els when  I got through Hyrum got up and made a confession for not  including the living Oracles.    wship Elder Pratt after what He has said, but I shall do it.

Wells who was fast recovering from his sickness while speaking of the Malays President Young said that He was of the opinion that the Malays were of the seed of Abraham they went to  those Islands the same as they came to this continent they are probably of Abrams promised seed. They have a cere marry for Eternity this principle shows that they obtained their traditions from Ancient Israel for the gentiles did not practice it &amp; it has been handed down among them through many Generations untill the present time. The Malays are a vary war like people &amp; proud   ENDENTRY   would perish they would not owe there lives to a slave. We see a great  varity  people some who do not know their right hand from there left  I see people freequently People who do not appear to have any underst- anding they will also increas but they will be so far behind they  will never catch up, and they will never be any thing but serv- ants. Such may be saved and get a good place. President Young said I corrected O Pratt to day. I did not say to him that God would  increase to all Eternity. But I said the moment that we say that God  knows all things comprehends all things and has a fulness of all that He  ever will obtain that moment Eternity ceases you put bounds to Eternity  space &amp; matter and you make an End and stoping place to it. The people  or many say thay cannot understand thes things, this is true No man  can understand the things of Eternity And Brother Pratt and all  men should let the matter of the gods alone I do not understand these  things Neither does any man in the flesh and we should let them alone  some men profess infidelity but when they go into Eternity they will find all they see in this life upon the Earth is ownly a similitude of  what thay will find in the next world. In speaking of the subject  of faith He said we will find but little faith but a good deal of belief  every body has that for it is an inherant principle in all. I have laid hands upon people when I knew they would be healed at other  times I have laid hands upon people when I did not feel that  way &amp; still they were healed. I once laid hands upon a sister  Lake when she said she had No faith I told her I did not care  whether she had or not for I had and I knew she would be  healed. I laid hands upon her &amp; she was imm dont know how it is or how faith comes ownly as the gift of God  I know No other way to get it. Joseph told  him once to go &amp; lay hands upon a person who was possessed of  a Devil &amp; cast him out and leave the house &amp; dont speak to  any person I did so &amp; left the house without saying a word  &amp; the devil left her.

Now here is the Presidency &amp; Twelve there is no two of them that look alike or preach alike, their minds  run in different channels yet they preach by the same spirit   ENDENTRY Sept 17 1865 There is not a Better or handsomer set of men to be found upon the Earth than they are. I am the most homely man  among them, so they let me say about what I am a mind to but if I get much out of the way, President Young is here to correct  me as it is his place to correct all the Errors of the Church. It is a hard Matter for the Lord to Esstablish his Church &amp; kingdom upon an Earth whare the devil has power &amp; dom- inion &amp; reigns over the hearts of the children of men &amp; it  would be an impossibility for the Lord to build up his kingdom upon this Earth if he could not get some element, even some of the children of men to work with him, and this has been the difficulty since the creation of the world, that the Devil has ruled over the hearts of the children of men to that degree that  the Lord could not find men Enough upon the Earth who would submit for the Lord to rule over them, &amp; lead them sufficient to build up his kingdom to remain upon the Earth. Even in the days of Enoch the Lord had to take him &amp; his company off from the  Earth because they could not live upon it. The Lord has now  set his hand one more for the Last time to Esstablish his kingdom upon the Earth to remain, to overcome the Devil &amp; his works &amp; subdue the Earth, &amp; the Lord has decreed that this should be accomplished and the Lord has taken all the pains in his power to Accomplish it He has brought forth the best spirits that Ever dwelt in His presence, to come forth upon the Earth to work with him in the accomplishment of this work. Even Joseph Smith was retained  in the Heavens for seven thousands years to come forth in  this day to lay the foundation of this Church &amp; kingdom to  be trown down no more forever, nor to be given in to the hands of  another people. The same is the case with the Presidency, Twelve &amp; many others in this Church &amp; kingdom &amp; the Lord has sent his Angels to watch over them from the day they were  born untill now, to prese who has sought there destruction from the beginning And we have visited the Nations of the Earth, for the last thirty years to gather together the seed of Ephraim, the best spirits that  dwell upon the Earth into these vallies of the Mountains to   ENDENTRY 1865 assist in esstablishing this great &amp; last kingdom of our God upon the Earth to remain forever, &amp; the Lord Almighty is inspiring his servants with the spirit of his work, &amp; the Holy Priesthood, &amp; is arming them with power to accom- plish his purposes upon the Earth. Joseph Smith was the promised seed to come forth to lay the foundation of the kingdom, see what he has Accomplished. He labored but 14 years, 2 Months, &amp; 18 days from the time He first organized the Church of Christ upon the  Earth, then He sealed his Testimony with his blood and all his  Father's family died as Marters &amp; will be crowned in the presence of God (Except William, if he had been a good man he would have   been in the spirit world with his  but he has not been fit to live or die) Joseph the Prophet during  his short labor laid the foundation of this great kingdom that  Daniel saw. ##Daniel 2:26-47## He organized the Church &amp; Kingdom with a full  &amp; complete organization, sent the gospel in its fullness &amp; glory to the nations of the Earth, gathered tens of thousands of Saints built  Temples &amp; founded cities, gave Endowments to the Twelve Apostles  Elders &amp; Saints &amp; sealed all the Keys of the kingdom of God upon The Brigham Young as there President. President Young is before you, look at him, he has the Appearance  of a Man about 40 years of Age, He is 64. He has travelled more  Miles, Attended More Meetings, Preached More sermons, delivered unto the people more of the word of the Lord, revelation blessings upon the heads of the  children of Men, United more in the Marriage Covenant,  Administered more of the ordinances of the House of God, Attended to more branches of business, had more wives, Raised up more children, created more recreation for the youth to keep them  out of the clutches of the devil, danced more cotilions, Built  more Temples, Tabernacles, Meeting Houses, School Houses, dwell- ings &amp; made more improvements &amp; done more for the salv- ation of Man, &amp; the redemption of the Earth than any  man that Ever dwelt in flesh during the space of 30 years, He has brought more to pass &amp; Accomplished more in  30 years than the Early patriarchs did in 500 years   ENDENTRY Sept 17, 1865 Why is all this, it is because the Lord is agoing to make a short  work on the Earth, in the last days, &amp; cut his work short in righteous- ness. He is inspiring his servants with the power of God &amp; the spirit of his work, &amp; a desire to build up his kingdom &amp; Mount Zion as Men have Never before been inspired. This great  &amp; mighty work is put into your hands to perform ye saints  of latter days. No greater work can be given into the hands of Men in the flesh. Then rise up ye saints of God &amp; do the work required of you &amp; the Lord will work with you, sustain  you &amp; redeem you &amp; give you power to Accomplish all that has been promised through the Mouth of all the Holy Apostles &amp; Prophets since the world began which may God grant for Christ sake Amen G A Smith Dismissed the Meeting     Hess 4, G A Smith 15, Young spok 10 Minuts Blessed the people &amp; dismissed    ENDENTRY September 18, 1865    the day in St George visiting.
