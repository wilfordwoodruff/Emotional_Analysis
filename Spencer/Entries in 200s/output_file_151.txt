 among the Fijians. They seem to be a much  lower class of people than the Maories; and Prest. Gardner did not express himself very favor- ably after his short visit, or call in, on way home; however, inasmuch as there seems to be a general good feeling and willingness to hear us pretty much all over the world, if you feel that the time has come when they should be offered the Gospel, I will be pleased to carry out any suggestion you may be led to make re- garding the matter.  The same condition also exhists with regard to the Chatham and Stewardt Islanders.  We have had a dreadful storm here of late, doing much damage on land and on sea, causeing much destruction of property and some loss of life. 'Tis again raining yester- day and today.  The health of the Elders generally is pretty good at present, so far as I have learned except the two to whom I have referred as having been released. Elder Moroni Lazenby's lungs were affected before he came out and have been growing worse until I thought it wise to release him. However, he has been very suc- cessful in getting inoto the language and

 favor of the 7th ult. advising us of five more Elders to arrive here the fore part of next month. We shall be pleased to  receive them, and a number more "5's" there- after. In fact you may accept this as an application for a number more than intimated at last writing, as there is a general demand for Elders pretty much all over the mission, and particularly amongst the Europeans. If things continue as they now seem, I think we can, with propriety, double our force which at this writing, stands at sixty-one in number.  We are endeavoring to ascertain from  Presidents of Conferences, how many more are really needed and can be profitably used in each Conference. Will report the number later on, perhaps about April.  It does not look as though we will get the Statistical report off by this mail, as some of the District reports have not come in correct, and poor mail fac- ilities require time to get corrected ones, but will endeavor to not be later than next mail.  A few Europeans are talking of

After further considerations I feel satisfied in my mind that Elder Andrew Smith Jr. is the proper man to take the presidency and watch-care of that part that you suggest as being known in the future as the Australian Mission. and as you leave it to me to make the appointment you may con sider him the man that will be appoint- ed.  His address is Newtown P. O. Sydney S N. S. W. Australia. I will at once notify him to that end and we will confer together to the bringing about of the proper division according to suggestions contained in your letter and our best judgement.  I see no reasons why the name by which you suggest this part being known in the future, viz: "New Zealand Mission" 
 has performed a firstrate work.  With kind re- gards to yourself and co-laborers I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel, E. F. Richards.

 emigrating with next company of returning Elders in April or May next.  We are not preaching the gathering to the natives, in fact 'tis with difficulty that we hold them down and keep them from emigrating. We are, however, encouraging the old people, particularly the chiefs who are just ready to depart this life, to work their genealogies up and make them a matter of record so that when they go they will not take this invaluable information with them. A number are doing it commendably well, and some are forwarding their genea- logies to Brother Hirini Whanga, Zion, for him to do the work at once. Perhaps you  would feel like suggesting as to the advis- ability of this being done to any great extent; or would each tribe be apt to be more satis- fied, in the future, to do their own Temple work, when the Lord opens up the way for them so to do? If not, it would furnish something for Hirini to do, and that much would be accomplished. ^Which I think is all right. J. F. S.^  Most of the Elders are enjoying first rate health and spirits. There are, however, a few exceptions, but we trust nothing of a serious

 nature. Many baptisms are being performed and we feel that, in the main, the work is progressing fairly well.  We had a little rain last week, the first for a long time, the season having been dry and hot, and to all appearances crops will be very light, especially in these parts.  A number of severe shocks of earth- quakes have been felt of late. One, Sunday 10th inst, said to be the most severe ever felt in the parts where it occured.  With kind regards to yourself and co-laborers, in which Elder Castleton joins, I remain  Your brother in the Gospel E. F. Richards.  I hardly think we should undertake just now to double the force of Elders in New  Zealand & Australia. But when the time comes that the Saints & friends of the Elders will contribute means to send the Elders home when their missions are ended, they should have all the[y] want. See 3rd page. J. F. S.

 Auckland, New Zealand. November 18th, 1896.  President Wilford Woodruff. Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  In addressing you a few lines concerning the interests of the work in this land, I deem it unnecessary to go beyond President Gardner's return, for he doubtless gave you a detailed report of it to that date.  Two days after parting with him at Sydney, Australia, I embarked for this island. Had rather a rough voyage, being caught in a storm, having our upper topsail yard broken, and the deck overflowed for two days, but no permanent damage was done. The ship, passengers and cargo all safely yeilded up at point of destination.  I visited and held conferences in the Hawkes Bay, Mahia and Poverty Bay districts, all of which were fairly attended, and, as we think, a success and product- ive of much good.  Continuing on to this place I met Elders Jedediah G. Casper and John H. Sargent, on their arrival, Oct. 12th, their companion, Elder Alma C. Lambert, having stopped to 
 Auckland New Zealand Aug. 24th 1897.  Prest Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City Utah.  Dear Brother: We are in receipt  of your favors bearing date of June 21st and  July 8th; also draft for equivalent of $200 as reffered to in the former.  Elders Aldous, Hardy and Holbrook have arrived safely and been assigned to their  fields of labor. Elder Bunot having  just met me when I received your request for  his immediate release, it was at once acted  upon; and he in connection with Elders George Jarvis and Bryant Ashby left for Zion  21st Inst. Per S S Warrimoo. The former had  been in the mission little short of two and a half years and the latter little rise of  that time both laboring among Europeans.  Elder Bunot learned prior to leaving that his dear mother departed this life the 7th ult.   hence her desire to again look up on her worthy  son in mortality, would not be granted.  One week previous, per S. S. Aorangi, Elders  Hyrum Cook and Jedediah G Casper left  the mission to return to Zion. The former  having spent two years and a half among 
 nan 
 Europeans, the latter about nine months, and  was released by his own request on account  of ill health. He had undergone a medical  examination and been told nothing short of  an operation would give permanent relief;  and that should be attended to without delay:  he wished to be at home with his folks to  have it performed. He had urine and other  troubles of an inward nature. He was pro- vided with the usual amount  25 to get him  home but having been here so short a time  I was a little at a loss to know what wou- ld be your feelings in the matter, and he felt  himself that it would be proper to return  it; and that he would prefer to do, said  he would remit that amount at the office S.  L. City.  Will forward by this mail blank filled  out of list of released elders as previously  instructed. Should you have any sugges- tions to offer regarding filling out blanks  in the future I would be pleased to except  them.  We would be pleased to release seven  Elders to return by the boat leaving here fore  part of November next; and in order to  make neccessary remitances for return fares 
 labor at Sydney. They were apparently in good health and spirits, and reported having had a fair journey from Zion. Both Elders were appointed to labor among Europ- eans on the South Island.  A letter previously received from you, stated that blanks would be sent by  the Elders for me to fill out on releasing missionaries. They have not yet been received, the last company of Elders having no parcel for me or the mission. I will take pleasure in carrying out your suggestions according to my best judgement when the blanks arrive.  After assigning the Elders to their fields of labor, I went into the Ngapuhi country, which includes the Whangarei, and Bay of Islands districts, from which place I returned last Wednesday. The natives in those parts are, as a rule, very poor, depending largely on gum digging for a livlihood, hence very widely scattered over the gum fields. However we managed to get enough together at different places to hold some fifteen meetings, besides other house to house work, and were blessed with the privelege of adding eleven souls to our numbers.

 Auckland, New Zealand Wednesday May 26th 1897.  Prest Wilford Woodruff P.O Box "B" Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  We are in receipt of your favors bearing dates of March 19th and April 26th. Also the Draft for  153 3/4 sterling. I appreciate the information given in reply to questions submitted.  We are also pleased to learn of the pros- pects of more Elders in August and October. It  would be to the interest of the mission if they were already in the field, getting a start in the language so to be better prepared to replace the prospecting releases mentioned in my last to you.  As regarding the propriety of dividing the Australasian Mission, I have felt for some time that a move of that kind would contribute  largely to causing the work to progress far more rapidly in Australia and Tasmania. As the Maori people and work are of so peculiar a nature is to wholly absorb one president's time. And at the same time the prospects are  very encouraging, at present, in those parts, and  could undoubtedly be followed up 
 we would be much pleased to receive  100 ster- ling before that time, if it be consistent  with finances on that end. I borrowed  10 ster.  of Elder George Jarvis and applied it on return  fares of the last company, giving him order on  you for that amount which I trust will  meet with your approval.  I am sorry to have to state that I have  just received a letter from Walter Baker Adela- ide, S. Aust. dated 2 Inst which reports his  companion, Elder Thos Clayton, in a very bad  condition of health. Apparently caused from  over study and the [w]rong kind of diet. He is  said to be troubled with indigestion and  dyspepsia, and his nerves are somewhat aff- ected, all of which makes him low spirited  and despondant at times. He was however  a little better after a special fast which  had been held for him. I have written  to be kept thoroughly posted regarding his  condition and if he does not get around rig- ht away will doubtless change him to other  parts or consider the propriety of releasing him.  The rest of the bretheren were in firstrate con- dition of health at last report, except that  now and again, one gets too fleshy out here  and is afflicted with boils. Most of them have 
 nan 
 nan 
 pretty well recovered from the itch.  Regarding the elders that it is expected will  come out in October but not stated how many.  We will be very badly in need of ten Elders  besides the three who have just arrived, to  replace those who have just left and who  we expect will leave in November. And  shall be much pleased to receive that nu- mber as soon as practicable and if one of  them could be a competent book keeper and  accountant, we would like to be iniciating  him in to succeed Elder Castleton in the  clerkship of the mission as his time is  near expireing.  There are two or three places on the  mission where some opposition & bittter  hatred have been manifested. A Corps of  Roman Catholic Irish policemen made  some threats over the brethren tracting  and attempting to travel without purse  or script in Queensland but by carrying  the matter up a little higher the Elders were  guaranteed justice & protection, and this  matter seems to have pretty well blown over. Now and then too, some minister has to  explode a little through the news papers,  but upon the whole, seems to me there is a 
 reported enough additions to make, in all, some fifty-two, most, or perhaps all of which  took place during the month of October.  The Elders, as far as reported, at present, are in good health and spirits, so we feel that the Lord is working with us, and abundantly blessing our labors. 'Tis not our greatest trouble to get people into the Church, for we have a great many fornication and adultry cases to contend with in this mission, which together with Maori Tohunga (sorcery work) com- prises most of the causes for people leaving  or being put out of the Church.  Twenty-two Elders have already been released and returned home during the present year, and it is now expected that eight more will return by the December boat, they all having performed two and a half years missions amongst Europeans, and three and a half amongst the Maoris, which is perhaps as long as any Elders are being kept out now days, at least, so far as I am posted. As yet there have only been fourteen arrivals to replace those who have returned, which has decreased our numbers some, and to a certain extent crippled us, for the way the Lord has swept away prejudice from the minds 
 closely with very satisfactory results.  Our last report showed a total of 21 souls in Tasmania; 22 in Victoria; 53 in New South Wales and 82 in Queenland, total 178; 4 organized branches; 2 Sunday Schools and a  Mutual Improvement Association. A number of  additions have since been made in every place except Victoria. There are now 21 Elders in  those parts, as follows: Tasmania 4; Victoria 2 South Australia 2; New South Wales 5 and Queen- sland 8. Each conference president has, some  time since, written me suggesting the propiety of more Elders. And in N. S. W. and Queens- land particularly have pleasing openings been  made, and desires been manifested for  Elders, which have not, as yet, been respond- ed to, for no other reasons than the lack of  enough to deem it wise to spare some from elsewhere. I have been very anxious about the work in those parts for some time, being  desirous of taking every advantage of these favorable oppertunities as they present themselves. And for the lack of sufficient time to visit the Continent in person. I have recently been led to write a general letter for guidance of  the European work and working Elders, with a 
 very good feeling among the people in general  regarding us, and what we represent. And  many are free to admit and comment upon  the great change that the maories in particular  who have embraced the gospel have under- gone through our teachings and labors.  The Latter Day Saints and their religion seems  to be getting better understood and more  kindly looked upon.  Since first of July, I have visited and  held conferences and other meetings in Wai- kato, Hauraki, Tarunga, Hawk's Bay, and Wai- rarapa Districts having good meetings and  in most places made some additions. July 11th we had the pleasure of baptizing  one Pepene a great chief of the Ngatimam [Ngati-tama] tribe,  and elder brother of our late respected brother  Reha Aperahamoa in whom we sustained  such a loss. Tis throught this one will come  to the front and contribute largely towards  making up the loss.  We have just closed a nice interesting  and we think profitable conference of the  Manawatu District at Porirua. I go to hold conference in the Mahia,  Poverty Bay and Waiapu districts. Ever praying for your enjoyment in 
 nan 
 nan 
 of the people, and inspired them with a desire to know more concerning us and that which we represent, it appears to me that we could, with great propriety, increase our number of Elders to a considerable extent.  President Gardner and I were united in this conclusion after our tour of the mission. If, therefore, the nine new Elders which he mentioned, get here between now and the end of the present year, we will have no trouble in assigning them fields of labor with- in the present borders where the work is being carried on, and shall be pleased to get twelve more here before our Annual Conference in April. I can also indorse Prest. Gardner's application for the two school teachers if it meets with your approval for us to start a few schools for the benefit of the natives.  Concerning the experienced Elder to be permanently located at Sydney, if I could learn his name ere his arrival, it might act as a preventitive against any mistake over here. It will be materially to the interest of the mission for all Elders to take tickets for Auckland, N. Z. except when differently ad- vised in special cases.  Up to date we have received no tidings

 view of economizing our time, and introdu- cing a more systematic and progressive course, and thereby perchance make better progress. Since its issuance I have heard from a number of the Elders, who have fully endorsed the move, and expressed themselves as having felt, for some time, the need of a more thorough and systematic plan being  adopted.  Elder Andrew Smith Jr., whom I men- tioned in my letter dated April 10th, is 33 years of age, and has labored in the miss- ion since Sept. 1895 energetically and satis- factorily. Should you fully decide to divide the mission, you may be led to either appo- int him to the presidency of the new one, or  send an Elder from Zion whom Elder Smith  could labor with and assist in getting thoro- ughly initiated into the work, while he  would yet remain in the field. Elder Smith seems to be endeavoring to preach the Gospel without "purse or scrip,"  and do his duty as a  servant of God.  Bro. Reha Aperahama, Prest. of Te Aroha branch, Hauraki District, and an influential chief, died fore part of this month. It was

 concerning remittances for the company return- ing in December, and as we do not get another home mail in time for them, I have taken the liberty of arranging with Brother Charles Hardy for the amount, with a slight interest, until it comes, which I hope will meet with your approval. He seems a little anxious that he should not be held out of his money more than a month or so.

In the future what course would you suggest for me to take, when there are no funds on hand, a[n]d the time arrives for the release of Elders, as I expect another company of five or six to return home after our Annual Conference?  With kind regards to yourself and colaborers, I remain, Your brother in the Gospel.  E. F. Richards  See over 
 a great blow, as he was a great support in those parts and much respected by many without, as well as the saints. Another  great chief of the Manauatu district, has also  died recently. He had formerly belonged to the  Church but been excommunicated.  A number of the Elders and many Maoris, have a burning itch. When nothing else presents itself they fill in the time scratching. 'Tis very annoying indeed while it lasts, but wears off  in time. Aside from this the Elders are, I beleive, in fairly good health. Elder Petersen's removal to Mahia seems to have improved his health some.  Since my last writing, a terrible storm and flood has taken place on parts of the  island, notably Hawkes Bay District, where some few people lost their lives. And thousands of cattle and sheep, as also other property damaged and destroyed. Very many are left in a state of destitution. Pleased, however, to  note that none of the saints lost their lives and but few were damaged seriously, as far as learned.  With earnest prayers for your good, and  well being in your advanced years, even that 
 I fear it is not wise to send so many Elders to those Islands. A fewer number of men, well qualified to preach the gospel and defend the truth would be better. Elders without good qualifications or bright minds should not be sent to these distant and expensive missions.  The money  197.0.0 we will have to keep before the Trustee in Trust or Presiding Bp.rick until we get it. So many Elders coming home so near together will almost swamp ups financially.  Let us keep this matter before us. J. F. S.  [sideways text] E. F. Richards Nov. 18 [18]96. [end of sideways text]

 Auckland, New Zealand. July 11th 1896.   President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  We address you a few lines  to let you know of the safe arrival of  Elders Ezra F. Richards and James  Steadman, on the 8th ult., in good health  and spirits. Since that time we two  have been traveling together, having already  visited three conferences, viz: Hauraki, Tau- ranga and Waikato.  On the 15th Inst. we expect to start  South and make a complete tour of  the Mission, that Elder Richards may  get a thorough understanding of all its  workings. The Elders, as a rule, are enjoy- ing good health; there are, however, one or  two exceptions, where the brethren are troubled  some with their lungs, and symptoms of  rheumatics.  During the month of June upwards  of forty baptisms were reported, and  prospects bid fair for many more in  the near future. Upon a whole, the 
 nan 
 Mission is perhaps, in a fairly prosperous  condition.  A company of Elders and saints  expect to leave Sydney, bound Zionward,  on the 10th of September next. It will  also be necessary to release another com- pany of eight Elders, to return Dec. 10: If you will therefore kindly send means  sufficient for the return of the latter  company, not later than by the October  boat. We would also be pleased if you  can send us another company of ten  Elders to replace the above mentioned  company. Five might take tickets to  Sydney Australia for European labor,  and the other five take tickets for  Auckland, N. Z.  With kind regards to yourself and  Co-laborers, we remain  Your Brethren in the Gospel, William Gardner Ezra F. Richards. Presidents of Australasian Mission.

 Woodville, New Zealand, Aug 2nd 1894.  President Wilford Woodruff and members of the  First Presidency.  My dear brethren,  I take pleasure in writing to you  and reporting the condion and necessities of the  Australasian Mission.  The good work is progressing nicely, and the Elders are reporting satisfactory results. I am travelling continually, endeavoring to visit all  the Maori districts, thus aiding the brethren laboring  amongst the Natives, and visiting personally as many  branches as possible.  In addition to our Maori districts, we have now ten  European districts in which Elders are especially assigned  to labor in spreading the truth, and the work is being  vigorously pushed amongst the Colonials.  A new European district has been formed in the  North, with the city of Auckland as headquarters, and  Elders J. Johnson and Jedediah Goff are now located  there.  The Elders in Tasmania give a very  encouraging report, having recently baptised a few members, and they are now calling for more help.  In the Australian colonies of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, we have now eight elders at 
 work, and I anticipate good results from their  earnest efforts.  We have also two European districts  on the South Island, one of which I have recently  visited, and the prospects there are very good.  In view of these facts, I have just called the Mission  Clerk, Elder B. Goddard, to make a few months tour  of the colonies, visiting all the Europan districts,  and assisting & encouraging the Elders laboring in  the above mentioned fields.  Adjacent to New Zealand are the Figi, Chatham, and Raratonga Islands, on all of which are large  numbers of natives, whose language is very similar to the Maori.  The latter two groups are under the  New Zealand government, and I am very anxious  to get the work started there.  If it is possible for you to send a few Elders who have a knowledge of Maori, I can use them  advantageously, in connetion with Native elders,  in opening up these new fields.  I recently received from you a number of pamphlets,  "Succession" by B. H. Roberts, for which accept our thanks.  These have been distributed amongst the Elders. Elders Stevenson, Crow, Armstrong and others, who  left San Francisco, May 3rd, arrived safely, and have  been assigned to their fields of labor. 
 Wm Gardner Nov. 2 [18]95  Auckland New Zealand, Sat Nov. 2nd 1895  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother: It is now several months since writing you from this Mission and it is with pleasure that I embrace this opportunity. Through the blessings of Almighty God, the labors of His servants have been pros- pered in this land, and it pleases me much  to be able to make an encouraging report. The brethren, with but one or two exceptions enjoy the best of health and all are in the  possession of the spirit of their holy callings. In some districts, where hitherto the Elders  have been able to do but little, the Lord has  opened up the way, that now very effectual work is being accomplished. In the month  of September forty one baptisms were report- ed, and prospects are most encouraging for many more in the near future.  I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of  $500.00/100, for the return fares of Elder Goddard and Company. On account of not having received money for the return of Elders Burton and Barrow, I have been compelled to  borrow their fares from Brother Thos. Finlayson. 
 1. I duly received draft for  50.16.4, as per your  letter of April 2nd.  I used the one fare on hand, as  originally intended for Elder B. Hamblin, and paid  the return fares of Elders Rasmussen, Douglas & Gibson,    84.0.0 = equal to  28.0.0 each  2. I respectfully request you to forward me  two return fares for Elders T. L. Cox and E. Ellertson, in case the latter has to be released on account of  ill health.  3. Will you also send me as early as possible, another company of Elders two for Tasmania and four for New Zealand. Those for Tasmania  should obtain tickets through to Sydney.  This company is required for European work,  and the Elders should be recommended to equip themselves with tracts and suitable literature. If you can send a few experienced Elders amongst these it would greatly facilitate the  work in the large cities.  4. We have great difficulty in obtaining tracts &c. for this Mission and it is too expensive to print them here.  Our funds will not permit us to do this at  present, as we have not yet fully settled for printing  the Maori Ready References.  We recently obtained  a quantity from Liverpool but they are all  disposed of. 
 who consents to having the money placed to  his credit in Zions Savings Bank; on the arrival of the Elders in Salt Lake City. A letter with  full particulars as to amounts &c. will be  sent you by them.  Two Companies of Elders have arrived safe- ly since last writing. They were all well, and  report the best of treatment and accommo- dations. Some were appointed to labor among- st Europeans while others were assigned to Mao- ri work. They are all getting along very nicely.  Elders J. F. Burton, Jas. Barrow, and a  J. Ridges, have been honorably released to  return home, and have filled good missions. The last though he has labored faithully  for more than two years, has been released a little prematurly, on account of failing  health.  Elder Andrew Jenson has arrived in our Mission, and invis[i]ting two Northern districts, we had most  pleasant times in Conferences with the saints. On the 5th we leave for the South to make a tour of the entire New Zealand Mission.  The brethren all desired to be kindly remem- bered and are ever praying for the welfare  of Zion. I am as ever,  Your Brother in the Gospel  Wm. Gardner President Australian Mission.  Good. J. F. S. 
 Auckland, New Zealand Tuesday Nov. 5th 1895  Elder Geo. Reynolds, Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother: Elders John F. Burton, James Barrow, and Alfred J. Ridges  have been released to return home and I have  been compelled to borrow money for their re- turn fares, from Bro. Thos. Finlayson.  78.0.0. have been apportioned amongst them which  should be placed to Thos. Finlayson's credit in the "Zion's Savings Bank"; on the arrival of  the Elders. Be kind enough to forward  the receipt to me at your earliest conven- ience.  Bro. Finlayson has offered to loan me the  money for the return of seven Elders in Janu- ary, provided it be placed to his credit in the Bank on the arrival of the brethren. Shall I accept the offer? It will save the trouble  of sending the money here and also of having  it changed, with which is connected more  or less expense. All is well with all.  I am as ever  Your Brother in the Gospel  Wm Gardner Prest. of Mission.  I think it good to borrow the money as proposed. J. F. S. 
 If you can render us any assistance in this matter,  with the next company of Elders, it will be a great  favor.  We need a large quantity of tracts, such as  Morgan's No1 and 2.  (No 3 is unsuitable here.) Roberts "Second Coming" and Character of Mormon people,  Rich's "True v. False religion, Budges 'Only true Gospel,  Nicholsoen's tracts and any others that are suitable  for general circulation on the First principles of the Gospel. If you have any spare copies of "Resources and attractions  of Utah," as circulated at the Midwinter Fair we could  use them to good advantage in all the public libraries  of the Colonies.  I trust you will pardon me referring  so urgently to this subject but there is such a demand  for our church literature now, that I deemed it prudent  to submit the matter for your consideration.  I shall be pleased to receive counsel from you  as often as circumstances will permit, and pray  earnestly that God will continue to bless and  prosper Zion.  Your brother in the Gospel, William Gardner.  Address c/o J H. Dalton,  Box 236 Auckland, New Zealand.  Let us do all we can in the way of furnishing  tracts &c. and otherwise.  J. F. S.

The last company of elders reached  Auckland safely and had had a health- ful and peaceful voyage.  After a few  days visit in this city, they received  their appointments as follows:  Elder  Browning to labor in Auckland a- mongst the "Whites." elders Lasenby, Teeples  and Waters amongst Maoris.  There was much need of laborers for  Europen fields, but owing to the destitue  condition of most of the brethren, circum- stances compelled me to send them a-  mongst the Natives, and that to districts,  which for the time being, were supplied. However, from these places, elders will be  released to return home in April and thus

 leave room for those lately sent there.  Many of our brethren labor under the  false impression that, if they have suffi- cient money to land them in Auckland  that such is all that is necessary. This is a mistaken idea, as most have  from one hundred to five hundred  miles to their respective fields of labor. If this were batter understood, much  embarrassment and inconvenience could  be avoided.  Those called to labor amongst Europeans need more or less money as  they go.  Immediately after the Annual Con- ference in April; Elders B. Goodard,J. E. Fisher, E J. Palmer, and M. C. Nielsen's time will have expired and if all is well they  will be released to return home. If cir- cumstances permit, will you be kind  enough to forward money for their fares  at your earliest convenience?  The release of these brethren will ne- cessitate the appointment of others in their  stead.  I kindly ask that if it be possible, you send not later than by the "February Boat" not less than six, that they may be assign-

 Kiri Kiri Thames New Zealand Feb 22, 1894  President Wilford Woodruff And Councilors  Dear Brethren it is with pleasure I write you a few lines from this the nethermost part of the vineyard to let you know how things are moveing in this part of the World the Elders and saints are all enjoying good health and spirits as far as I know at present. Since Prest W. T. Stewart left on the 31 Dec I have been traveling in the North of Auckland held Conference in the Whangarei District the health of Elders and saints is good and a good spirit is burning  in the hearts of the P[e]ople we have baptised 19 souls and blessed 12 Children since Prest Stewart left that is in the North we visited a good many of the Branches in both Districts and incouraged them to forsake their evil ways we were asailed by Ministers and Apostates and the power of God was with us so they could all see the difference between truth and error and I feel that our spirit will do much good, as many of the peopl came in because their Chiefs came and the most of such have left the Church and those who are coming in at present thouroughly understand the principles of the Gospel and it looks like the tide was turning again 
 in our faver as there has been a great many left the Church in the Bay of Islands.  Dear Brethren I feel my weakeness very much in asumeing this great responsibility to Presiding over this Mission but I am willing to do all that is in my power to help the cause of truth and trust in him that doeth all things well I am one of Utahs first crop and am a little behind in learning but I desire to be found at my post till you can do better I received the $500.00 return fare for Prest Stewart and company have paid Charles Hardy $200.00 borowed by Prest Stewart.  After the April Conference Elder L C Rassmussen William Douglass and Westley Gibson will be released haveing performed usefull missions as far as ^I^ could find out from Prest Stewart if you can forward enough to pay thier fare Home dand I would sugest that they be released to return Home Prest Stewart said he would speake to you in relation to them and also in relation to two experienced Elders to Labeor in Auckland City  On ac[coun]t of my traveling around so much the statistical Report has not been received yet but I expect it tonight I am sure Elder Goddard has sent it but my mail matter has been missent.

 Auckland, New Zealand, January, 23rd 1896.  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City  Dear Brother: Your letters of Sept. 12th and Oct. 14th have been received, and I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of $100.00/100 for return fare of  Elders.  A company of Elders has just arrived in this mis- sion and have been appointed to their respective fields  of labor as follows:          Jos. F. Derbidge Christchurch Amongst Europeans     Wm G. Park Sydney [Amongst Europeans]     David A Nelson [Sydney] [Amongst Europeans]     Robert A. Argyle Brisbane [Amongst] [Europeans]     George Burnham Whaigaw [Amongst] Maoris     Schuyler E. White Wauau [Amongst] [Maoris]     Elders Hoagland, Bartlet, Jorgensen, Petersen, Abbott, and Nebeker having been honorably released to return home,  it became necessary for me to borrow more money of  Bro. Thos. Finlayson, for their return fares, which amounted  to  157.0.0. Please have that amount placed to his  credit in Zions Savings Bank, and forward the receipt  for the same by return mail.  ^Soon^ After the April Conference seven elders will be re- leased to return home. This will necessitate the appoint- ment of others in their stead. Please send a company

 of eight, on the March boat.  Select two Elders suitable for  European labor, and instruct them to purchase their tickets  for Hobart Tasmania. Two, also for European work may  get their tickets forSydney, and remain theirre. The others  may come to Auckland, New Zealand.  Our Annual Statistical Report will be forwarded  by the next mail.  The Elders and Saints throughout the mission  are well, and are in the enjoyment of the spirit of  the Gospel. It gives me great pleasure to report that  the truth is spreading in this distant part of the  Lord's Vineyard. The time for our April Conference is  fast approaching and we hope to have a season  of spiritual rejoicing. Our Northern Annual Con- ference held at Te Aroha on Jan. 3rd 4th and 5th was a most successful one, and we trust good  results will come therefrom  May God prosper Zion and all her interests. Your brother in the Gospel,  William Gardner. President Australasian Mission  We must raise this money if possible and  select 8 Elders for the March boat as desired. If we can get this number to submit to the Twelve  soon perhaps they can be seen on time.  J. F. S.  [sideways text] Wm Gardner Jany. 23 [18]96. [end of sideways text] 
 Christchurch Canterbury N. Zealand July 8th 1895  President. Wilford, Woodruff, And Counselors  My Dear Brethren  I take pleasure in informing  you of the conditon of affairs in this Mission. We are all well, with the exceptions of Elders Stephenson who has been aflected with sore eyes for some time; and Elder  John Walker from Huntington who has been Ill ever  since his arrival in the Mission, therefore I deem it  wisdom to release him to return on the August Steamer  as he has not been able to do any Missionary Labor as yet. He is troubled with liver complaint. And his head and  eyes are bad, and he cannot study he will therefore Return  in company with some of the Saints.  The rest of the Elders are  fully enjoying the Spirit of their Labors and I am  happy to say the work of the Lord is progressing  nicely in this Mission. New openings are being made  and people are inviting the Elders to come and hold  meetings in their school Houses, in a few instances, and nearly all the Elders are asking for more help. I haven't yet heard anything in relation to the last company of Elder ordered. Nor the return fares for  Elder Goddards Company  no doubt it will be hear  next mail.  It will be nesessary to release Elder  John F. Burton and James Barrows in the Month  of September. Therefore if you will kindly send 
 Tamaki, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand April 9th 1895.  President Wilford Woodruff,  Beloved brother,  I take pleasure in informing you that  our Annual Conference has just closed and we  have been blessed with an abundant outpouring  of the Spirit of God. In our Sacrament meeting  we had over 200 Visiting Europeans and  hundreds of Maoris came from all parts of  New Zealand. Thirty seven elders from the  various Conferences in Australasia were  present and the reports were highly satisfactory  and encouraging. The work is progressing  nicely in all our fields and we rejoice in  these evidences of divine favor.  A Company of Elders and Saints will  leave Sydney on May 18th for Vancouver in charge of Elder B. Goddard.  X We shall require, as early as possible, eight   more Elders, to fill vacancies that will shortly  occur. Four will be required for Maori work  and four to labor amongst Europeans.  I also need an earnest experienced elder  to take Supervision of The Conferences in  Australia and Tasmania, with whom I 
 me the money for their return fare as soon as  posible; as Elder Hardy is geting a little short  at present and I am owing him  100.0.0 for return fare  of Elder Goddards Company.  If you can spare another  Company of Elders we can use them to an advantage in the Mission ast there will be a large Company of  Elders ^released^ about the last of the year and the first of  the new one.  I am quite well and enjoying my Labors very much. Ever praying for the welfare of Zion with love and blessing to all.  I remain your Brother  and colaborer in the cause of Truth  William Gardner Box 236 Auckland New Zealand  At least from 500$ to 800$, should be  sent to bro. Gardner at once. These matters, relative to Samoa, New Zealand Tonga, Northern States, & Cal. should  be called up, and I think You bro. George, as Secretery, should do it, and I will assist you - J. F. S.

 could correspond continually as I am  unable to visit them. Elder Goddard has  just returned from an extended trip and,  will be able to report to you fully on his  return to Salt Lake City.  X In a short time it will be necessary to  release Elder Charles Peterson so please  forward the requisite funds by return mail.  On account of your remittances  for elder's return fares being so different,  I am not sure what amount you desire  me to pay to them. I have only paid the  last two companies  25 each and if this  is not correct please settle with the Elders  at the Office. I feel impressed, however,  to state that many of our Elders, are almost  destitute when their terms expire, especially  our Maori elders who are compelled to  purchase clothing &c before they can commence  their return journeys.  Many of them also are great distances  from Auckland & Sydney, and in some  cases it costs about  4 to reach the  port for American Sailings.  I shall also esteem it a favor if  you can possibly arrange to remit 
 funds in time for me to settle with  the Elders, when their time expires as  I have been compelled to borrow from Bro. Hardy several times of late in  order to accomodate the returning  Elders.  With kind regards  I remain  Your Bro. in the  Gospel  Wm Gardner.  [sideways text] Wm Gardner  Apl. 9 [18]95. [end of sideways text] 
 President Woodruff said he was pleased to see the people, the labor done, and the country he was favorably impressed all around.  In regard to teaching the young as spoken of, he said when a boy he was taught by Professor whose Porter whose son is now Pres of Yale College. He had learned to quote scripture quite well. Was some prepared to receive the Gospel when  presented. Always had a desire to serve good. After attending a protracted meeting when about twenty years of age (and a miller by trade) on attending a protracted meeting all was given the privilidge to speak. His morale was so beat on the work of God that he enquired of the minister as to the gifts and powers of the Apostolic days They informed him he would be a useful  man in society but, for those foolish notions, boy speaker remarked that he wished those dark ages would come again. It has now come and we are a part of it. Bro Woodruff had spent  two thirds of his life connected with the princi ples taught by God through His prophets.  Religion of Christ required union in prayers building fences, church houses, ditches and all the helps and organizations such as Releif Society, Mutual Improvements, Primaries etc etc. We should be in unison with one another. All sisters should be members of Releif Societies All young Brothers and sisters should belong to the Mutual Improvement Associations. So with the Sabbath Schools. The Lord organ- ized these institutions, as well as the Primary to stay for the promulgation of His truths. These institutions were likened to a Nursery There were forty thousand children in these mountains to be trained daily. The younger 
 with primaries, elderly ones according to their capacities. These institutions form our character for eternity. For these we ought to be of all people the most thankful for His care. The eyes of the heavens and the earth are upon us. We cannot afford to sacrifice of our hopes of exaltation forever for anything upon the earth. By neglect ouof our duties we loose spirit of God then comes apostacy. He would rather die a thousand deaths than be devoid of this spirit to cause him to fall away.  The doctrine of Baptism for the dead was spoken of. It was a very important principle, so much so that we could not fully comprehend. Fifty thousand millions of people who have lived since the days of Christ had to be admin istered for. No people but the L.D.S. had that power.  Celestial Marriage was spoken of. The binding power of the Priesthood was of inestimable value to all mankind. Gave his observations in a pecuniary point of view as to the ones who practice this law and vice versa. While but one wife and one child it was harder to get along, than when the husband of several wives and many children. No person would occupy a celestial position without a wife. No wife would be found ^L D B.^ in the Terrestrial. We should not fight the Celestial law. But desire to obey it. Lorenzo. D. Barnes who had died in England as one of the first elders without priviledge of obeying it this law would be judged accord ^80^ ingly. The speaker would be eighty year ^3^ old in three days. Had quit quarrelling lon[g] 
 ago. Husbands be kind to their wives. Wives be kind to husband and children. Dont scold, scold, and drive. These Ephraim chil- dren are hard to drive. They can be lead, not drove. Presidents Young, J. Taylor, Geo. Q. Cannon and many more were obedient to Joseph Smith yet such men could not be made slaves of.  In regard to Ppolitics, put good men in office. [O]fficers work for the county good and not feather your nests. Said that a great immigration was sure to be the lot of this Stake. Spoke forty minutes. Choir sang "O give me back my prophet."  Benediction by President Gunnell. 
 President Wilford Woodruff  said we had met to partake of the emblems of  the body and blood of Christ. No Latter Day  Saint ought to be ashamed of being a follow- er of our Savior altho he came on this earth in  a very humble condition. See how he suffered  bled and died, while at the same time he had power  to destroy those who were persecuting him. The prophet  ^39 years^ Joseph Smith while in prison showed his devotion  to God and his Christ, as witness his prayer at that  time recorded in ##Doctrine & Covenants 121-122|Book of D&C page 121-2##:  Altho the laws of the Jews did not allow one to  administer in religious matters until thirty years  of age, and was crucified about three years after ^33 1/2^ See what mighty works he had done in so short 
 a time in organizing the church, performing  miracles, etc. He was a very poor man. Did  not have wherewith to pay his taxes until he  sent Peter to catch a fish with money in its  belly for that purpose. As Christ gave his life  for others, so it was to be the same with others,  Joseph Smith gave his life. It was necessary  for the Testator to seal his testimony with their blood. It seems as though this was  to be the case from before the foundation of  the earth. Instead of having bad feelings  towards our enemies such as congressmen and  rulers, we should feel to pray for them. Had  followed President B. Young to the penitentiary  when arrested by order of Judge McKean.  Had felt at the time that judgment ought  to be passed on Judge McKean. Judge McKean  had passed from this earth as though a nother.   Shaefers experience in the edict against  the saints, carrying sertain banners in pro- cession, had gone ^on^ very short notice. Numerous,  other instances can be cited to show that  "vengeance is mine, and I will repay it saith  the Lord is verified."##Romans 12:19## Had seen the revelation  on the late civil war in the United States  twenty five years before it happened. 
 "I have resserved judgements for all my enemies"  has been verified all through the states of Mo.  That State suffered in kind, only in greater  abundance, the punishment inflicted by them  on the Saints while in their midst. It was  far better to leave justice to God rather than  take it in our own hands. This Kingdom is  set up for ever. The Celestial Law of Marriage the highest law he ever gave to the children of  men. He will hold every man responsible  for his own deeds. Spoke of Joseph Smiths  prophecy to Stephen A. Douglas relating to  his aspiring to the Presidency of the United  States. When Douglas fought the Saints, by  declaration, he went down in estimation of  all men, and died poor. So it was with  nearly all the Judges, Rulers & statesmen.  God was attending to His business better than  we should. We should pray. Learn to be  prayerful. No man spends a day twice over.  We are making character every day. Be  careful how we form character.  Infidelity is taking the world. The world is  making rapid strides to overturn the religion  of their fathers. Knew Tim Ham at one time  to say that there was upwards of six hyndred 
 religions, all having different ways to heaven. Tim said when they got there there would  be a "Hell of a heaven," the speaker thought so too. Exhorted all the priesthood to be alive to their duties and callings. A priest or teacher or deacon had power with the heavens just as well as an Apostle had. Prayed God to bless all present and all Gods people. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff Spoke on the need  of working together to care for our stock, crops etc. Beleived it right for a Bishop to go to  work as Prest Ricks had done. It was re- quired at the hands of every Latter Day Saint to  be a worker in temporal as well as spiritual  affairs. Had desired when he first embraced  the Gospel, to preach ^to^ the nations of the earth.  Since that time he had travelled far enough  to go around the world six times as his diary  would show. The religions of to day can not  turn the hearts of our children away from the  Gospel that is with them daily. They propose  to do so, but they will fail. Live your religion  live to your prayers. Show me a praying  father, and I will show you praying children.  Mothers have great power over their children.  Their children look to them for guidance.  Said God would bless our flocks, herds  children, lands. The clerk then read a  circular to President Ricks relating to Temple  work in Cache Stake and its work and  programme of labors. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said Bro Grant  preached upon many principles this morning  that were for our benefit if carried out. In re- gard to revelation, Joseph Smith was led the  most of his life by revelation. So it is in regard  to the living prophets and apostles. Jesus said  straight is the way that leads to destruction and  narrow is the path that leads to eternal life  and few there be that find it. ##Matthew 7:13## There were  Telestial, terristrial, and Celestial conditions  of happiness. Those who earn one reward will  not reap the reward of the other except yet be the  greater absorbing the lesser glory. The Celestial  law is unpopular, Gods truths were always so.  He said He called them out of the world, con- sequently they were not of the world.##John 15:19## Gods  truths were never popular, as the fulness of  the Gospel is given to this generation it must  embrace every principle advanced before  time. Joseph Smith received the powers of  the two priesthoods: The keys pertaining to the  uniting of the dead to the living. The keys of  gathering the scattered Israelites from all  nations, and all other keys, knowledge,  power necessary to obtain salvation in  the presence of God and his associates. 
 The law of celestial marriage was one  of these powers. The world do no understand  us or these laws mentioned because they were  in possession of the Spirit they were given in.  We are not of the world, consequently, the laws  we are given are different. There has not a  person existed on the earth since the apostasy,  immediately following the Apostolic dispen- sation that has administered with authority  in any ordinance of the Church of Christ, for lack  of the priesthood. There is no ordinance given  by the father to man but what is necessary.  Christ fulfilled the law of baptism to fill the  law. No man can ignore a law of God  with impunity. When the principle of baptism  for the dead, about twelve years after the church  was organized, was revealed, all felt to praise  God. We neglected to keep a record of our baptisms  consequently we had to do it over again.  The  law of tithing is imperative and must be lived up  to. If we do not, it shows lack of faith. This  principle is being lived up to better than formerly. 
 The Word of Wisdom is well to be lived up to. Would not be over zealous in keeping any law. Said there Ira Haines of Wellsville killed himself by leaving tobacco unwisely alone. All would be blessed in keeping Gods Word whether  of Wisdom or any other principle. Said a very great Reformation was taking place for the better. The Lord would not give the Patriarchial Order of  Marriage except it were for his benefit. The law would exalt to the highest glory, as to the lowest hell. There is no blessing without sacrifice. The greater sacrifice, the greater blessing. The blessing to Abraham to outnumber the sands  of the sea shore ##Genesis 22:17## with his posterity must have to be lived up to in a future state. This law is  the strength of future greatness. I say in the 
 name of Israels God, there is no person, man or  woman who has obeyed this law but what will be exceedingly rewarded for their sacrifice.  If you cannot gather strength to live it, dont fight it. Leave it alone, that you may not be lowered in what would be otherwise be your reward. The history of those who fight this law among the Gentiles is not to be sought after. All who obey this law will be blessed. After the passage of the Edmunds Law, had every son of Israel took him another wife, I believe God will would deliver this people. It take a life of righteousness, as well as many wives, to obtain exaltation. A man must treat all his wives alike. No favors to one at expense  of another. Bear and forbear with one another. When a man faithful man passes to another world his work goes on. He labors for his wives  and his families until he attains exaltation. There is a temporal blessing attached to the  living this law. My wives are each one better 
 provided for than I ever was before entering into this law. So it is in regard to all the leading men in the Church. So it always would be, both in this life and the life to come.  Dont be afraid to obey this law. But be prudent As the children of Israel would rather live up to the laws of God than bow to Belshassars  God Baal and so receive His blessing. So will the Latter Day Saints. Contrary witness the biography of the rulers, judges and great men of the nation who fight this work  and you find their destruction commences at that time. It pays to keep the commands of God. The closer the Latter Day Saints live up to His laws, the more we are blessed. We are the finest people on the earth at  the present time. Young men, pray. 
 Priesthood After the Prophet J. Smith hawas placed in prison he uttered the prayer cited in Book of D&C, page [blank space] also read the answer. The question why did Oliver Cowdery and a great many others fall? It was because they forgot the power of the Priesthood. They looked to the things of this world. Every portion of the priest- hood has power with the heavens by faithfulness I had the greatest power manifest in my behalf when on my first mission while a Priest. I travelled ten thousand miles in  that capacity. I went a thousand miles with the prophet Joseph while I was a Teacher. I say magnify your callings, deacons, teachers priests and Elders. This is given us to magnify. All heaven is watching over us. I thank God for these Temples where we can officiate for our ancestry. I wish the vail could be lifted from the face of this people so they would see the necessity of attending Temple ordinances.  President Taylor and myself are the only persons living of the Twelve who received our anointings and endowments at the hands of the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland.  minutes 77 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it was  indeed wonderful to note the moves of the work  of the Lord. The leaders of the Johnson army has about all passed away, mostly in a summary  manner. The Lord has fulfilled a great  many revelations in the past fifty years.  I do not know of a single soul of those mobocrats  or their sons who have embraced the Gospel. I  speak of the Illinois and Missouri mobs. But  great were the trials of those States, and many  were their sufferings in kind the same as  what they inflicted on the Saints while in their  midst. Gen Doniphan had testified that  he had witnessed many of the words of Joseph  Smith fulfilled.  The prophecy of the  brother of Jared as recorded in Book of Mormon  in relation to the government of this land would  be truly fulfilled. [##Ether 4:4##] When this nation refused to  avenge the death of the martyrs, they allowed  their blood to cry from the ground against them.  They got blood, in the civil war. This people  would be a great people yet. They had God on  their side. The Lamanites would be a great  help in spreading the Gospel. Had travelled  a great experience among them. The first time  I spoke to one company they kept me till one 
 o'clock. They were very inquisitive as to their ancestors. One old lady spoke and said "When a girl her mother said that some white men would come from the west who would tell them about their ancestors. A great work is being fulfilled through them.  If we do our duty, God is with us. Zion must have room to grow. You are going to have a great city here, a great country, be faithful. Go This Kingdom will grow and increase. There is a warfare between truth and error. Truth will come off conqueror. God bless you, get your work done that is needful to do. I can carry a good report of you and your labors and country. Pleased I came to visit. 
 Read  P.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus. Feb 10th  1898.  First Presidency  of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-day Saints.  Beloved Brethren:  I write  you a few lines that you may learn of  the safe arrival of Elders Frederick E.  Barker and Charles D. Fox, on the 6th inst. wWhen they came to Sydney. On account of the  missunderstanding of the arrival of the S. S.  Miawerra, they had no one to meet them either  by person or letter. aAlthough I received no word of  their coming still I was impressed there might be  some one or more. Elder Barker did not realize  any effect of Sea sickness. but elder Fox was  very bad at times and gave elder Barker to  understand that if the rough weather continued  much longer he was afraid he could not stand  it but he looks acceplright, and although  he was so bad, we had a hearty laugh after  it was all over and the pittiful story was  related to us. There does not seem to be much  sympathy extended to sea sick persons, as  very few die but the reverse they seen to  get so that many, at least, are better able to enjoy  their meals than before the ordeal they are called  to pass trough.

 Elder Fox will leave 11th inst for Melbourne to labor with Elders H. W. Barton and Enoch L. Reese Elder Barton has been poo^r^ly in health for some time and will be released to return to Zion as soon as we can raise means or rather receive some from home.  Elder Barker will go to Brisbane 12th inst. to assist Elder Wm Armstrong in the Queensland Conference, and as Wm Armstrong will be called to labor with relatives in the course of a few months Elder Barker will, I believe, be able to take up the lead of the work in that conference. am well pleased with the elders sent, have been able to place two good men capable of doing their part in the possitions placed.  Some of the elders have had poor health lately but when the hot weather is over, as there is nothing serious in their illness es, they will be all well again.  The work is quietly making way into the families of the honest and I believe we can look for some fruits of the labor performed by the elders. there have been, I believe, eight baptisms performed and several children blessed since I last wrote you and look for more in the near  future.  I am well and desire to do my part. I go to Brisbane in company with elder Barker.  I hope each of you are in the enjoyment of good health, and pray God to bless you.

City, Utah,  Beloved and honored brother,  As I have been called through your instruct- ions to take the lead, and preside in the what is now known as the Australalion Mission, I take the liberty to write you a few lines, among those things necessary, are as follows  I would ^be pleased^ to receive  100 One hundred pounds, to release Elders who have fil[l]ed long missions. on the return of the receipt of this letter, if you find it convenient to do so.  I would also be pleased to have six Elders sent to take the places which are and will be vacated by the releases of four soon. I will not say anything to them regarding the arrangments before I get word from you.  There is much that could be done here in Australia if Elders were here to the amount necessary. It seems a few do not cause enough stir in getting the people to take the interest I would like to see. There are many, from the work the Elders are doing, believe what we teach to be the truth and do not join because of the great prejudice and the slowness ^of the work^ and many dwindle away from that which we have been able to instil into their minds by there not being enough encouragmint; from our labors.

 and all you do; may it ^you^ be magnified in the  eyes of the people by the power of the Holy  Ghost, that they may honor each of you  as the living oracles of God on earth.  and may all obey the counsel you give to them.  May the Lord comfort each of you in all  your going out and coming in before the Lord ^Him.^  Your Brother in the work of the Lord  Andrew Smith Jr Pres.  P. S. I send the address of Wm Woodcock as I believe it will be a more permanent address. Wm Woodcock 25 Toogood Street, Erskineville two miles from Wharf towards Newtown. If the elders were to go from the wharf to George Street the main street of Sydney, and take the newtown bus to the newtown Post Office then go down the Erskineville Rd until they reach Toogood St they will have no difficulty in finding the above address and they will send some one to look us up. A. S. Jr.  Feb 12th [18]98  I was talking with the gentleman with whom we do business at the Huddard Parker Co's office yesterday and said the fares for the return to Portland of our people is  13.12.0 all others  16.0.0 straight.  There are no particular complaints from the elders on this Route, but many would like to return by Sanfrancisco. A. S. Jr.

 We could put one hundred Elders in the  City of Sydney, or Melbourne, and there would be a great deal for them to do.  I would be pleased if such could be the case, that that number could be sent to Sydney.  To show you how little a few Elders are known by the masses, Since the last opening up of the work at Sydney, ^they^ knew nothing about Elders laboring in Sydney.  There was a very untruthful piece published about our people and we deemed it wise to answer it, and the people were surprised to know that we had been here so long, and had been doing the work that we reported in answer to the piece, and it took the Editor, (from the surprise of our being here) several weeks to get over what he had done and get on his wicked head again to give us another blowing up.  We had the satisfaction of getting our Articles of Faith published and a few good words of advise regarding our cause and felt we had done our part without slander.  We have at the present 21 Elders in  the Mission and could work many more if we  had them. The Elders are all enjoying good health and are doing what they can in allaying prejudice, gaining friends, and the Lords is blessing some with fruits for the labors performed.

 In the City of Launceston, Tasmania, Elders have been laboring for some time and have met with no apparrent success until ^quite^ recently. The subaurbs are being tracted and the work is going on nicely, there are about 16 members and quite that number who are preparing themselves to have the ordinance of baptism performed that they can be properly initiated into the  true fold of Christ. There are some very nice people in the Island of Tasmania and I believe a good work can be done.  I feel that the Elders in this mission are doing the Cause justice, the stamp of love is written ^in^ the demeanor of the great majority of them and is growing stronger with them day by day, and I am thankful to our Heavenly Father for the privilege I have of laboring among such noble sons.  I also thank God and you that I have been call to this far Southern Clime, and that such honor is placed upon me, it is  something I never looked for. I like the calling of travelling Elder too well to ask for any thing higher but as I understand that we are expected to improve, and if we prove faithful in the exalted possitions we are called to fill we will be blessed. otherwise if the office and calling is desecrated, a curse instead of a blessing is given. 
 Answered WCS  P.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Friday April 22nd 1898.  President Wilford Woodruff.  and Councillors,  Beloved Brethren:  Your letter to me with instructions (to me) as to what you desire will be carried out to the very letter if possible. I do not think I will be able to leave Sydney before the 18th of June, as the work to be done will keep me here (in the Colonies) until after the leaving of the May boat.  The agency at Sydney have not received any instructions from Mr Coyle up to date. Two mails have come since I received letter from Geo. Reynolds informing me of the arrangments made between you and the agent at Vancouver. I believe the changs^ing^ of the agency, from the Huddard Parker Co. to the Burns Philip's S.S. Co at Sydney has caused them to overlook the latter part i.e. the instructions they should have sent to Sydney. I have two men released from  their labors and if word does not come before the next boat leaves it will very much inconvenience them. If they have overlooked it entirely I may be delayed in my return, there have been two other elders released to leave Sydney June 18th

 Regarding the traveling to the different conferences, they being so far apart, the nearest is 500 miles Shanks povies are very  good but it takes quite a time and I believe a great amount of time wasted to walk and this would not reach them all, it is an expensive mission for the size to do any traveling. Prest Richards and myself were up to Brisbane and were well paid for our visit The cheapest way is by boat more time etc saved The mission is in a poor condition to keep a President if traveling expences are paid unless he gets help from other sourses he will either have to be content to remain in one place and pay his way when he is able to. I would like you to advise me what to do in this matter. I believe if the Elders and Saints were visited once in a while much good could be done and would pay for the expence in time.  The following address could be given to Elders coming to Sydney, Australia. No 30 Malcolm Street Erskineville Sydney N. S. W. the above address is our headquarters. Also I would be pleased if Elders would enquire for letter directed Care of Second Steward this will have instructions, as to what I would desire them to do.  [sideways text] Cannot a furnish money from here to travel [end sideways text] 
 Elder Barker is at Brisbane arrang- ing the work in that part and will be in Sydney after the 1st of May.  All being well we will travel together making a visit at Launceston & Hobart, Tasmania, and Melbourn & probably Ballarat Victoria. After all business is perfected between elder Barker and your humble servant, I will make some inquiries concerning some of my relatives who live in these parts, who I have not had addresses of until the   last Vancouver mail, then I will be pleased to return home.  I feel greatful for the ^your^ appreciation of my labors in the missionary cause, and the little good that has been accomplished I appreciate, and in return I give our Heavenly Father praise and Honor for it all. I know the Lord has been with me in my travels and work among the people, (Saints and strangers) for my thick head would never have been able to do the little good that has been pleasing for me to look upon, then it was not me it was the Lord, I being His humble Instrument through whom He did the work.  With love for the work I am engaged in, I remain a servant of the  Lord.  Andrew Smith Jr. Pres

 Andrew Smith Jr Jan. 26 [18]98  P. O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus. Jan 26th 1898.  Wilford Woodruff And Councillors.  My Beloved Brethren:  Several months ago, President E. F. Richards, in order that he could learn from the Missionary elders to a certain extent the  labors performed by them, formed a report which he  desired each elder to fill out immediately after  the end of each month, there being some time  during the 24 hours of each day that I have not  been given account of and which I thout essential I have added more for the elders in my part to fill out.  There are some elders who put in very little time and having something of the nature diagramed for  the elders to report upon. The president is able  to suggest where he would otherwise be at a loss, at  times, to offer suggestions or give advise to the elders, and  they having a form to work to can understand to a certain  extent the labor required of them. Some will average 2 & 3 hours per day. while others, laboring under the same circumstan- ces average 6 & 8 hours and if we had no report given 
 nan 
 of labors performed each month, many of the elders  would be robing the Lord and that possibly not knowingly.  The work of the Lord is prospering throughout the  Mission, although not many ^are^ added to the Faith yet. tThose who have joined are endeavoring to serve the Lord and  are being educated in the glorious Gospel.  We have two very interesting Sunday Schools which  are attended by Saints and outsiders. also two very  interesting M. I. A., and the saints are getting grounded  in the work of the Lord and it does my heart good  to hear them bear testimony to the devinity of the  work they have engaged themselves to.  Some of the elders do not seem to take the council  of the inspired Servants at home when setting them apart  to missions. and there will be something said and done  if they, the elders when they come on missions do not leave  the girls alone and cease making love to them, there are some  here, and where I have learned of the same, I have given them the  information that they were disobeying council. and I could not  and would not countenance their actions. The health of the  elders is generally good. With love and best wishes for you and yours, and  all the Saints. I am your brother in the Gospel Andrew Smith Jr. Pres.

 P.O. Newtown, Sydney N. S. W. Aus. Sat. NApril 9th 1898.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff, and Councillors  My Beloved Brethren:  I think you would be pleased to learn from this part of  the Lords vinevard occassionally and therefore I  occupy myself at the present time, to inform  you of some of the good accomplished since  my last to you.  When elder Fred E. Barker arrived at  Sydney arrangments were made for him to go to  Brisbane, and Elder C. D. Fox who arrived with  him to labor as a traveling elder in Victoria. I decided to go to Brisbane with elder Barker  and during my stay there I was taken down with a fever known in these parts as the Dengue it  seems to be a complications of complaints in  the system, a number of the elders have also  been affected with the same.  The work of the Lord in that part, (Brisbane)  is moving along nicely, after witnessing the  ordinance of baptism performed, also assisted in  the confirmation. Organized a Relief Society with  officers and aids numbering ten in all. Ordained  one teacher, and two deaconcts, the M.I.A  being in a disorganized state for a short time was reorganized, and introduced some ideas (new  to the members) in the sunday school. a good spirit

 nan 
 prevailed, and the saints were satisfied that the  Lord had a hand in all that had been done for  the progress of the work in that part.  Elder Wm Armstrong was honorably released from presiding in the Queensland Conference, granted the  opportunity of Laboring among his many relatives  in N. S. W. Fred E. Barker was appointed to preside  in elder Armstrongs stead.  Several elders have been sent out to labor  where opportunity has been better given to spread  the work and warn the people.  Instructions have been given and arrangments  are made to hold conferences ^tomorrow 10th^ at Sydney, Brisbane, and Launceston, and a good time is anticipated  I received the letter from Geo Reynolds, inform- ing me of the arrangments between you and the C.P. S.S. Agent, will no doubt learn of the instructions  to their agents in Sydney the 12th inst. would have  been able to tell you of the perfected arrangments  at this writing if there was not so many holly-days here at the present time, no business being done  from good Friday until after Easter Monday.  I will acknowledge the receipt of the letter  from Bro Reynolds to me.  With love and best wishes for  you in ^the^ multitudinous duties you are called to  perform, I remain a weak instrument in the  work of the Lord.  Andrew Smith Jr. Pres

 Old Cleveland Road, Coorparoo, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, April 18, 1898.  Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith,  Salt Lake, Utah.  Beloved Brethren:  Your letter of March 8th, apprising  me of the honorable release of Elder Andrew Smith, Jr., from the position of President of the Australian Mission and appoint- ing me to that position, came to hand to-day.  While feeling keenly the sense of my weakness and un- worthiness thus to be honored with this important and very responsible station, I feel very thankful to receive in con- nection therewith your prayers and blessing, which I prize above all things of the earth.  I have felt the blessings of God so far with me in this mission, and I am now constrained to say that with the same continued upon me (which I shall claim, and believe I shall have, in redoubled measure) I will do my best in every way to merit the confidence reposed in me by you and to further the interests of this mission, so far as may lie in my power.  I was about a month ago installed here in the po- sition of  Pres't of the Queensland conference, taking the place of Bro. Wm Armstrong, who went to labor at Sydney among his relatives 
 nan 
 There is a branch here of abt. 70 souls, and the care of  this with its various organizations (R.S., S.S., M.I.A., Priesthood meetings, etc.) makes a field for considerable labor, vigilence and activity on the part of the president of the conference stationed here. I am glad, however, to have had the experience afforded me therein, as well as that gained by laboring among strangers, wherein I have tried to be fully active.  Some changes have been made, two Elders have been appoint- ed to a new, and, we believe promising, field, and we confidently expect some fruit of our labors in the near  future. This mission now presents an apparently  barren field, however, there being so much indifference to religion in general and so rarely sufficnt virtue and zeal to impel the people to even attempt to live a religion requiring what the Gospel does.  It is my belief that later on we shall reap some fruit in this land, though at present it looks discourag- ing. In some cases Elders have lived in and tracted a neigh- borhood for many months without seeing much good result, fur- ther than making some kind friends.  There are a few good people now investigating, who, I be- lieve will yet yield obedience to the Gospel message.  Your ob't servant and brother in the Gospel,  F. E. Barker.  Future Add. Newtown P.O. Sydney, N. S. W., Australia.  P.S. I should be pleased to be informed if it is now contemplated that in any case worthy local talent may be called to labor in the mis- sion field as in assisting in tracting, etc., and if so in what manner  the call should be made.

 FREDERICK E. BARKER, PRESIDENT.  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS. OFFICE OF PRESIDENT AUSTRALIAN MISSION, NEWTOWN P.O., SYDNEY. N. S. W. AUSTRALIA.  52 Burren Street, Erskineville, Sydney, May 22, 1898.  Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith,  Salt Lake, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  There are now 22 Elders laboring in  this mission, two of whom are released to return home next month, (June [18]98).  In case others are released after being 2 1/2 years in the field (as has heretofore been the rule of practice) there will be two more to be released before Oct. next, and three during that month, thus reducing the number from  22 to 15, not counting any hereafter to arrive. Elders Rudolph Korth and Jno. B. Mathias arrived on the 10th inst., and have gone to their fields of labor.  We shall be under some difficulties at once to prosecute the work now under way, and could easily use double the force now in the field. There are numbers of places where I believe openings could be made to some advantage, as where we already have one or  more members or friends. Elders who could speak German would be specially valuable in some parts.  There have been four baptisms within the past month.  Your Brother in the Truth, F. E. Barker.  Let us send from two to three  each each month until he shall be supplied at least with from six to 12 Elders one or two good German speakers J. F. S 
 F. E. Barker May 21 [18]98 
 Br. Woodruff said:  The Lord told Joseph Smith that he was laying the foundation of a great work, but he knew it not. He felt this was the case with these Relief Societies. Referred to the discourses of some of our returned missionaries, both from the North & the South. They all testified of the want of virtue & of the degeneracy of society.  Spoke of the great labor which lies before the Saints. The L.D.S. do not realize it.  Pres. Young is capable of instructing us: he is called of God to lead. Zion is not yet es- tablished in its beauty & glory. Spoke of our children: noble spirits who have come here to bear off the Kingdom. There are many spirits yet to come: also many which are waiting for us to do a work for them. Some men will hear a sermon an hour long, & then go forth & trade with our enemies. A great responsability rests upon both men & women in this respect.  Our leaders are abundantly inspired to lead us. Beleived that this people are advancing, are improving. We are not going to stay here long, but have a tremendous work to do. He should hate to go into the spirit world & have his fathers & mothers ask him why he had not performed this work or that for them 
 Sundays past the assembly has been addressed by Prest. Kimball at length in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothed with the Spirit and power of God, so that he has freely satisfied  his mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, we or our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified and benefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowded to excess during the evening meeting. Brother F. D. Richards & [my]self being the only ones of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionaries  with the assistance of Prest. Grant, under the directions of Prest. Young to preach throughout this city, all the wards during Winter have met in the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the word of the Lord. We have attended a meeting of some kind about every evening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests, Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confined to reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism for the remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood, prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing, seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani- festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for our blessings. Elders O. Hyde & L. Snow were with us during the setting of the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors &  the Spirit & power of God has rested upon us in our labors. Elder Hyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost in mass are rising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the Reform- ation, confessing their sins and restoring what they have done wrong. Meetings are crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere is sencirly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren &  live their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down vice & iniquity in all the forms. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a few of the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince & Co[mpan]y. as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we would also wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bear in mind, the propriety of bringing with them or forwarding as they may have opportunity any choice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will be a benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedling strawberries or any other good kinds Lawton's Huckberry, Calamba & Isabella Grapes, Indigo or madder or cotton seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane or Millet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seeds and grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite a benefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.  The Reformation is progressing thoughout this city and Territory with great interest. President Young has given much valuable information and teaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attend the meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant on the 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with his counsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernacle was crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter and hundreds have to leave who cannot get into the house, the appearance of Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months created a sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for about one hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to the people, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the hearts of the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful. He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses will appear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people for several Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 Bro. Taylor,  I have named in my letter that I wished to get the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel to see something about it, but not knowing that he will be able to do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00 and direct him to put up that amount, and send it to W. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will pay the money here in any way that you will order.  W. W

 OFFICE OF THE NORTH WESTERN STATES MISSION CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF LATTER - DAY - SAINTS.  NO. 104 BROADWAY, 3d FLOOR.  Council Bluffs, Iowa, 188  Salt Lake City, Jan. 4th 1888.  Elder Dennis E. Harris,  Dear Bro.  The health of Brother Wm M. Palmer, who has been presiding over the North Western Mission, is such that we consider it improdent for him to continue his services in the missionary field at the present time, espe- cially during the cold weather of winter.  His lungs are very feeble, and have been much  impaired by his continuous speaking.  We would like him to have a respite from the labor of preaching, and therefore, in consul- tation with him, have concluded to appoint you as President for the time being in the North Western Mission.  We have requested Bro. Palmer to continue his oversight of the mission. We know that his heart is in the work, and that he is familiar with that field; therefore, we shall depend upon suggestions from him from time to 
 2 time.  Whatever information you have to communicate, however, concerning the affairs of the mission, we trust you will send it to my Office, so that we may have it there to refer to in case we should think it necessary.  In appointing you to this labor, we beseech God, our Eternal Father, to abundantly qualify you, for the great responsibility which rests upon you, to endow you with every gift and grace,  and to make you equal to every labor and emergency. If you seek the spirit of revelation,  you will receive all that is necessary to enable you to counsel the Elders, over whom you are called to preside, in regard to their labors, and that which is best to do to make them successful and also concerning the organization of Branches,  Conferences, and opening new fields, and everything necessary to enable you and your fellow laborers to thoroughly warn the people throughout the states where you are called to labor.  With love, and praying the Lord to be with you,  to preserve you from the hands of all your enemies,  I Remain Your Brother W. Woodruff 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON, OMAHA.  P. O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U. T. July 20th, 1889.  Elder William M. Palmer,  Dear Brother:  In relieving you from the responsibility of the  Presidency of the Northern States Mission, or, as it was formerly called, the North  Western States Mission, we feel that it is but justice to you to express our  feelings concerning the labors which you have performed while acting in that  capacity. Your services have been most satisfactory, and the only fault that we  have felt to find with you, if we were to attempt to find any, has been that you  have not been sufficiently careful of your own health and have exerted yourself  to an extent that we feared might undermine your constitution. You have been  exceedingly diligent in the performance of your labors, and the work has prospered  under your presidency. We have regretted that your health and other circumstances  have been such as to compel us to release you.  No doubt, the remembrance of your labors will live  in the memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the  memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the memories of the souls who, through your instrumentality as a servant of God, have  been brought to the knowledge of the truth. 
 nan 
 We ask God the Eternal Father to bless you in all your  labors, to give you strength and grace to endure every trial, and to enable you  to maintain your integrity even unto the end, that you may be crowned, with the souls  that you have helped to save, in the celestial kingdom of our God.  We remain  Your brethren and fellow-servants,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith

Dear Brother:  Your letter of the 27th ulto upon the subject of appointing an Elder to preside pro. tem. in the North Western Mission, has been received. We do not think it proper to request you in your present condition of health to go out to the mission and remain there, as you propose to do, if we say so. Your health is of value to yourself, to your family, and to the cause, and we think you should take care of yourself and endeavor to recover from the attack from which you have 
 nan 
 have suffered. Your lungs require rest, and you had better, during the winter season especially, be very careful about speaking in public, and if you do speak at all not to speak long at a time. We are well satisfied with your labors in your mission, and hope that your usefulness will not be impaired by any imprudence on your part in taking care of yourself. It would be gratifying to us to learn that you have completely recovered the strength of your voice and lungs. In the meantime we think it would be very proper for Bro. Dennis E. Harris to act as President of the North Western Mission for the time being.  We nominate him upon your recommendation and trust that he will fill the position in a manner to bring glory to the Lord's cause and salvation to the people. We would still like you to maintain an oversight over the affairs of that mission and to make such suggestions from time to time concerning it as you may

 Feb 21, 1883  Joseph F Smith says that some one has written in History that the Melchizidek Priesthood was not revealed unto the Church untill 1831 It should read that it was not called the Melchisedek the Melchisediek untill 1836 He also says that the section 132 in ##Doctrine and Covenants 132|D & C## on plurality of wives instead of readig that it was given in July 12, 1843 it should read it was first written in July 12, 1843 for it was given in 1831.  He also said that it had been published through mistake that Nephi instead of Moroni had given the Plates to Joseph Smith while it was Moroni & not Nephi [##Joseph Smith History 1:55-65##]  340 Miles from S L C to St George 226 to Milford ^220 +^ 120 ^= 246^ to St George 
 Feb 21, 1883  W Woodruff says that when Joseph Smith the Prophet Received the Apostleship with all the keys there off He received all the Melekizedaek Priesthood including the Patriarchal office, and every office which belongs to all the offices which belong to the  Church and kingdom of God on the Earth. when a Man is ordained to the Apostleship with the keys thereof He is ordained to the Highest Office Ever given to Man on the Earth. W Woodruff also says that Joseph Smith never conveys any Idea that any other Man Except Moroni gave him the  Plates containing the ##Book of Mormon## He also says that Joseph Smith declaired 
 that the remarks made in the old Edition of the ##Doctrine and Covenants 119|D&C## section 119 upon Marriage was Printed By the urgent request of Oliver Cowdery against the wish of Joseph Smith the Prophet, for the Principle upon Celestial Marriage was revealed to Joseph Smith in 1831.
