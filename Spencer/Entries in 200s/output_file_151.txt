They seem to be a much lower class of people than the Maories; and Prest.Gardner did not express himself very favor-ably after his short visit, or call in, on wayhome; however, inasmuch as there seems to bea general good feeling and willingness to hearus pretty much all over the world, if you feelthat the time has come when they should beoffered the Gospel, I will be pleased to carry outany suggestion you may be led to make re-garding the matter.The same condition also exhists with regardto the Chatham and Stewardt Islanders.We have had a dreadful storm here of late,doing much damage on land and on sea,causeing much destruction of property andsome loss of life. 'Tis again raining yester-day and today.The health of the Elders generally is prettygood at present, so far as I have learned exceptthe two to whom I have referred as havingbeen released. Elder Moroni Lazenby's lungswere affected before he came out and have beengrowing worse until I thought it wise torelease him. However, he has been very suc-cessful in getting inoto the language and

 favor of the 7th ult. advising us of fivemore Elders to arrive here the fore partof next month. We shall be pleased to receive them, and a number more "5's" there-after. In fact you may accept this asan application for a number more thanintimated at last writing, as there is ageneral demand for Elders pretty muchall over the mission, and particularlyamongst the Europeans. If things continueas they now seem, I think we can, withpropriety, double our force which at thiswriting, stands at sixty-one in number.We are endeavoring to ascertain from Presidents of Conferences, how many moreare really needed and can be profitablyused in each Conference. Will report thenumber later on, perhaps about April.It does not look as though wewill get the Statistical report off by thismail, as some of the District reports havenot come in correct, and poor mail fac-ilities require time to get corrected ones,but will endeavor to not be later than nextmail.A few Europeans are talking of

We are, however, encouragingthe old people, particularly the chiefs whoare just ready to depart this life, to worktheir genealogies up and make them amatter of record so that when they go theywill not take this invaluable information withthem. A number are doing it commendablywell, and some are forwarding their genea-logies to Brother Hirini Whanga, Zion, forhim to do the work at once. Perhaps you would feel like suggesting as to the advis-ability of this being done to any great extent;or would each tribe be apt to be more satis-fied, in the future, to do their own Templework, when the Lord opens up the way forthem so to do? If not, it would furnishsomething for Hirini to do, and that muchwould be accomplished. ^Which I think is all right. J. F. S.^Most of the Elders are enjoying firstrate health and spirits.

 Auckland, New Zealand.November 18th, 1896.President Wilford Woodruff.Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:In addressing you a fewlines concerning the interests of the work inthis land, I deem it unnecessary to go beyondPresident Gardner's return, for he doubtless gaveyou a detailed report of it to that date.Two days after parting with him atSydney, Australia, I embarked for this island.Had rather a rough voyage, being caughtin a storm, having our upper topsail yardbroken, and the deck overflowed for two days,but no permanent damage was done. The ship,passengers and cargo all safely yeilded up atpoint of destination.I visited and held conferences inthe Hawkes Bay, Mahia and Poverty Baydistricts, all of which were fairly attended,and, as we think, a success and product-ive of much good.Continuing on to this place I metElders Jedediah G. Casper and John H. Sargent,on their arrival, Oct. 12th, their companion,Elder Alma C. Lambert, having stopped to 
 Auckland New ZealandAug. 24th 1897.Prest Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City Utah.Dear Brother: We are in receipt of your favors bearing date of June 21st and July 8th; also draft for equivalent of $200as reffered to in the former.Elders Aldous, Hardy and Holbrook havearrived safely and been assigned to their fields of labor. Elder Bunot having just met me when I received your request for his immediate release, it was at once acted upon; and he in connection with EldersGeorge Jarvis and Bryant Ashby left for Zion 21st Inst. Per S S Warrimoo. The former had been in the mission little short of two anda half years and the latter little rise of that time both laboring among Europeans.Elder Bunot learned prior to leavingthat his dear mother departed this life the 7th ult.  hence her desire to again look up on her worthy son in mortality, would not be granted. One week previous, per S. S. Aorangi, Elders Hyrum Cook and Jedediah G Casper left the mission to return to Zion. The former having spent two years and a half among 
 nan 
 Europeans, the latter about nine months, and was released by his own request on account of ill health. He had undergone a medical examination and been told nothing short of an operation would give permanent relief; and that should be attended to without delay: he wished to be at home with his folks to have it performed. He had urine and other troubles of an inward nature. He was pro-vided with the usual amount  25 to get him home but having been here so short a time I was a little at a loss to know what wou-ld be your feelings in the matter, and he felt himself that it would be proper to return it; and that he would prefer to do, said he would remit that amount at the office S. L. City.Will forward by this mail blank filled out of list of released elders as previously instructed. Should you have any sugges-tions to offer regarding filling out blanks in the future I would be pleased to except them.We would be pleased to release seven Elders to return by the boat leaving here fore part of November next; and in order to make neccessary remitances for return fares 
 labor at Sydney. They were apparently ingood health and spirits, and reportedhaving had a fair journey from Zion. BothElders were appointed to labor among Europ-eans on the South Island.A letter previously received fromyou, stated that blanks would be sent by the Elders for me to fill out on releasingmissionaries. They have not yet been received,the last company of Elders having no parcelfor me or the mission. I will take pleasurein carrying out your suggestions according tomy best judgement when the blanks arrive.After assigning the Elders to their fieldsof labor, I went into the Ngapuhi country,which includes the Whangarei, and Bay of Islandsdistricts, from which place I returned lastWednesday. The natives in those parts are,as a rule, very poor, depending largely ongum digging for a livlihood, hence very widelyscattered over the gum fields. However wemanaged to get enough together at differentplaces to hold some fifteen meetings, besidesother house to house work, and were blessedwith the privelege of adding eleven souls toour numbers.The mail awaiting me on my return 
 Auckland, New ZealandWednesday May 26th 1897.Prest Wilford WoodruffP.O Box "B"Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:We are in receipt of your favorsbearing dates of March 19th and April 26th. Alsothe Draft for  153 3/4 sterling. I appreciate theinformation given in reply to questions submitted.We are also pleased to learn of the pros-pects of more Elders in August and October. It would be to the interest of the mission if theywere already in the field, getting a start in thelanguage so to be better prepared to replace theprospecting releases mentioned in my last to you.As regarding the propriety of dividing theAustralasian Mission, I have felt for some timethat a move of that kind would contribute largely to causing the work to progress farmore rapidly in Australia and Tasmania.As the Maori people and work are of so peculiara nature is to wholly absorb one president'stime. And at the same time the prospects are very encouraging, at present, in those parts, and could undoubtedly be followed up 
 we would be much pleased to receive  100 ster-ling before that time, if it be consistent with finances on that end. I borrowed  10 ster. of Elder George Jarvis and applied it on return fares of the last company, giving him order on you for that amount which I trust will meet with your approval.I am sorry to have to state that I have just received a letter from Walter Baker Adela-ide, S. Aust. dated 2 Inst which reports his companion, Elder Thos Clayton, in a very bad condition of health. Apparently caused from over study and the [w]rong kind of diet. He is said to be troubled with indigestion and dyspepsia, and his nerves are somewhat aff-ected, all of which makes him low spirited and despondant at times. He was however a little better after a special fast which had been held for him. I have written to be kept thoroughly posted regarding his condition and if he does not get around rig-ht away will doubtless change him to other parts or consider the propriety of releasing him. The rest of the bretheren were in firstrate con-dition of health at last report, except that now and again, one gets too fleshy out here and is afflicted with boils. Most of them have 
 nan 
 nan 
 pretty well recovered from the itch.Regarding the elders that it is expected will come out in October but not stated how many. We will be very badly in need of ten Elders besides the three who have just arrived, to replace those who have just left and who we expect will leave in November. And shall be much pleased to receive that nu-mber as soon as practicable and if one of them could be a competent book keeper and accountant, we would like to be iniciating him in to succeed Elder Castleton in the clerkship of the mission as his time is near expireing.There are two or three places on the mission where some opposition & bittter hatred have been manifested. A Corps of Roman Catholic Irish policemen made some threats over the brethren tracting and attempting to travel without purse or script in Queensland but by carrying the matter up a little higher the Elders were guaranteed justice & protection, and this matter seems to have pretty well blown over.Now and then too, some minister has to explode a little through the news papers, but upon the whole, seems to me there is a 
 reported enough additions to make, in all,some fifty-two, most, or perhaps all of which took place during the month of October.The Elders, as far as reported, atpresent, are in good health and spirits, so wefeel that the Lord is working with us, andabundantly blessing our labors. 'Tis not ourgreatest trouble to get people into the Church, forwe have a great many fornication and adultrycases to contend with in this mission, whichtogether with Maori Tohunga (sorcery work) com-prises most of the causes for people leaving or being put out of the Church.Twenty-two Elders have already beenreleased and returned home during the presentyear, and it is now expected that eightmore will return by the December boat, theyall having performed two and a half yearsmissions amongst Europeans, and three and ahalf amongst the Maoris, which is perhapsas long as any Elders are being kept outnow days, at least, so far as I am posted.As yet there have only been fourteen arrivalsto replace those who have returned, which hasdecreased our numbers some, and to acertain extent crippled us, for the way theLord has swept away prejudice from the minds 
 closely with very satisfactory results.Our last report showed a total of 21souls in Tasmania; 22 in Victoria; 53 in NewSouth Wales and 82 in Queenland, total 178;4 organized branches; 2 Sunday Schools and a Mutual Improvement Association. A number of additions have since been made in every placeexcept Victoria. There are now 21 Elders in those parts, as follows: Tasmania 4; Victoria 2South Australia 2; New South Wales 5 and Queen-sland 8. Each conference president has, some time since, written me suggesting the propietyof more Elders. And in N. S. W. and Queens-land particularly have pleasing openings been made, and desires been manifested for Elders, which have not, as yet, been respond-ed to, for no other reasons than the lack of enough to deem it wise to spare some fromelsewhere. I have been very anxious aboutthe work in those parts for some time, being desirous of taking every advantage of thesefavorable oppertunities as they present themselves.And for the lack of sufficient time to visitthe Continent in person. I have recently beenled to write a general letter for guidance of the European work and working Elders, with a 
 very good feeling among the people in general regarding us, and what we represent. And many are free to admit and comment upon the great change that the maories in particular who have embraced the gospel have under-gone through our teachings and labors. The Latter Day Saints and their religion seems to be getting better understood and more kindly looked upon.Since first of July, I have visited and held conferences and other meetings in Wai-kato, Hauraki, Tarunga, Hawk's Bay, and Wai-rarapa Districts having good meetings and in most places made some additions.July 11th we had the pleasure of baptizing one Pepene a great chief of the Ngatimam [Ngati-tama] tribe, and elder brother of our late respected brother Reha Aperahamoa in whom we sustained such a loss. Tis throught this one will come to the front and contribute largely towards making up the loss.We have just closed a nice interesting and we think profitable conference of the Manawatu District at Porirua.I go to hold conference in the Mahia, Poverty Bay and Waiapu districts.Ever praying for your enjoyment in 
 nan 
 nan 
 of the people, and inspired them with a desireto know more concerning us and that whichwe represent, it appears to me that we could,with great propriety, increase our number ofElders to a considerable extent.President Gardner and I were unitedin this conclusion after our tour of the mission.If, therefore, the nine new Elders which hementioned, get here between now and theend of the present year, we will have notrouble in assigning them fields of labor with-in the present borders where the work is beingcarried on, and shall be pleased to gettwelve more here before our Annual Conferencein April. I can also indorse Prest. Gardner'sapplication for the two school teachers if itmeets with your approval for us to start afew schools for the benefit of the natives.Concerning the experienced Elder to bepermanently located at Sydney, if I couldlearn his name ere his arrival, it mightact as a preventitive against any mistake overhere. It will be materially to the interest ofthe mission for all Elders to take ticketsfor Auckland, N. Z. except when differently ad-vised in special cases.Up to date we have received no tidings

 view of economizing our time, and introdu-cing a more systematic and progressivecourse, and thereby perchance make betterprogress. Since its issuance I have heardfrom a number of the Elders, who have fullyendorsed the move, and expressed themselvesas having felt, for some time, the need ofa more thorough and systematic plan being adopted.Elder Andrew Smith Jr., whom I men-tioned in my letter dated April 10th, is 33years of age, and has labored in the miss-ion since Sept. 1895 energetically and satis-factorily. Should you fully decide to dividethe mission, you may be led to either appo-int him to the presidency of the new one, or send an Elder from Zion whom Elder Smith could labor with and assist in getting thoro-ughly initiated into the work, while he would yet remain in the field. Elder Smithseems to be endeavoring to preach the Gospelwithout "purse or scrip,"  and do his duty as a servant of God.Bro. Reha Aperahama, Prest. of Te Arohabranch, Hauraki District, and an influentialchief, died fore part of this month. It was

 concerning remittances for the company return-ing in December, and as we do not getanother home mail in time for them, I havetaken the liberty of arranging with BrotherCharles Hardy for the amount, with a slightinterest, until it comes, which I hope willmeet with your approval.

F. RichardsSee over 
 a great blow, as he was a great supportin those parts and much respected by manywithout, as well as the saints. Another great chief of the Manauatu district, has also died recently. He had formerly belonged to the Church but been excommunicated.A number of the Elders and many Maoris,have a burning itch. When nothing else presentsitself they fill in the time scratching. 'Tis veryannoying indeed while it lasts, but wears off in time. Aside from this the Elders are, I beleive,in fairly good health. Elder Petersen's removalto Mahia seems to have improved his healthsome.Since my last writing, a terrible stormand flood has taken place on parts of the island, notably Hawkes Bay District, wheresome few people lost their lives. And thousandsof cattle and sheep, as also other propertydamaged and destroyed. Very many are leftin a state of destitution. Pleased, however, to note that none of the saints lost their livesand but few were damaged seriously, as faras learned.With earnest prayers for your good, and well being in your advanced years, even that 
 I fear it is not wise to send so manyElders to those Islands. A fewer numberof men, well qualified to preach thegospel and defend the truth would bebetter. Elders without good qualificationsor bright minds should not be sent to thesedistant and expensive missions.The money  197.0.0 we will have to keepbefore the Trustee in Trust or PresidingBp.rick until we get it. So manyElders coming home so near togetherwill almost swamp ups financially.Let us keep this matter before us.J. F. S.[sideways text] E. F. RichardsNov. 18 [18]96. [end of sideways text]

 Auckland, New Zealand.July 11th 1896. President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:We address you a few lines to let you know of the safe arrival of Elders Ezra F. Richards and James Steadman, on the 8th ult., in good health and spirits. Since that time we two have been traveling together, having already visited three conferences, viz: Hauraki, Tau-ranga and Waikato.On the 15th Inst. we expect to start South and make a complete tour of the Mission, that Elder Richards may get a thorough understanding of all its workings. The Elders, as a rule, are enjoy-ing good health; there are, however, one or two exceptions, where the brethren are troubled some with their lungs, and symptoms of rheumatics.During the month of June upwards of forty baptisms were reported, and prospects bid fair for many more in the near future. Upon a whole, the 
 nan 
 Mission is perhaps, in a fairly prosperous condition.A company of Elders and saints expect to leave Sydney, bound Zionward, on the 10th of September next. It will also be necessary to release another com-pany of eight Elders, to return Dec. 10:If you will therefore kindly send means sufficient for the return of the latter company, not later than by the October boat. We would also be pleased if you can send us another company of ten Elders to replace the above mentioned company. Five might take tickets to Sydney Australia for European labor, and the other five take tickets for Auckland, N. Z.With kind regards to yourself and Co-laborers, we remainYour Brethren in the Gospel,William GardnerEzra F.

 Woodville,New Zealand, Aug 2nd 1894.President Wilford Woodruff and members of the First Presidency.My dear brethren,I take pleasure in writing to you and reporting the condion and necessities of the Australasian Mission.  The good work is progressingnicely, and the Elders are reporting satisfactory results.I am travelling continually, endeavoring to visit all the Maori districts, thus aiding the brethren laboring amongst the Natives, and visiting personally as many branches as possible.In addition to our Maori districts, we have now ten European districts in which Elders are especially assigned to labor in spreading the truth, and the work is being vigorously pushed amongst the Colonials.A new European district has been formed in the North, with the city of Auckland as headquarters, and Elders J. Johnson and Jedediah Goff are now located there.  The Elders in Tasmania give a very encouraging report, having recently baptised a fewmembers, and they are now calling for more help.In the Australian colonies of Queensland, Victoriaand New South Wales, we have now eight elders at 
 work, and I anticipate good results from their earnest efforts.  We have also two European districts on the South Island, one of which I have recently visited, and the prospects there are very good.In view of these facts, I have just called the Mission Clerk, Elder B. Goddard, to make a few months tour of the colonies, visiting all the Europan districts, and assisting & encouraging the Elders laboring in the above mentioned fields.Adjacent to New Zealand are the Figi, Chatham,and Raratonga Islands, on all of which are large numbers of natives, whose language is very similarto the Maori.  The latter two groups are under the New Zealand government, and I am very anxious to get the work started there.If it is possible for you to send a few Elderswho have a knowledge of Maori, I can use them advantageously, in connetion with Native elders, in opening up these new fields.I recently received from you a number of pamphlets, "Succession" by B. H. Roberts, for which accept our thanks.These have been distributed amongst the Elders.Elders Stevenson, Crow, Armstrong and others, who left San Francisco, May 3rd, arrived safely, and have been assigned to their fields of labor. 
 Wm GardnerNov. 2 [18]95Auckland New Zealand,Sat Nov. 2nd 1895President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother: It is now severalmonths since writing you from this Missionand it is with pleasure that I embrace thisopportunity. Through the blessings of Almighty God,the labors of His servants have been pros-pered in this land, and it pleases me much to be able to make an encouraging report.The brethren, with but one or two exceptionsenjoy the best of health and all are in the possession of the spirit of their holy callings.In some districts, where hitherto the Elders have been able to do but little, the Lord has opened up the way, that now very effectualwork is being accomplished. In the month of September forty one baptisms were report-ed, and prospects are most encouragingfor many more in the near future.I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of $500.00/100, for the return fares of Elder Goddardand Company. On account of not havingreceived money for the return of Elders Burtonand Barrow, I have been compelled to borrow their fares from Brother Thos. Finlayson. 
 1. I duly received draft for  50.16.4, as per your letter of April 2nd.  I used the one fare on hand, as originally intended for Elder B. Hamblin, and paid the return fares of Elders Rasmussen, Douglas & Gibson,   84.0.0 = equal to  28.0.0 each2. I respectfully request you to forward me two return fares for Elders T. L. Cox and E. Ellertson,in case the latter has to be released on account of ill health.3. Will you also send me as early as possible,another company of Elders two for Tasmaniaand four for New Zealand. Those for Tasmania should obtain tickets through to Sydney.This company is required for European work, and the Elders should be recommended to equipthemselves with tracts and suitable literature.If you can send a few experienced Eldersamongst these it would greatly facilitate the work in the large cities.4. We have great difficulty in obtaining tracts &c.for this Mission and it is too expensive to print themhere.  Our funds will not permit us to do this at present, as we have not yet fully settled for printing the Maori Ready References.  We recently obtained a quantity from Liverpool but they are all disposed of. 
 who consents to having the money placed to his credit in Zions Savings Bank; on the arrivalof the Elders in Salt Lake City. A letter with full particulars as to amounts &c. will be sent you by them.Two Companies of Elders have arrived safe-ly since last writing. They were all well, and report the best of treatment and accommo-dations. Some were appointed to labor among-st Europeans while others were assigned to Mao-ri work. They are all getting along very nicely.Elders J. F. Burton, Jas. Barrow, and a J. Ridges, have been honorably released to return home, and have filled good missions.The last though he has labored faithully for more than two years, has been releaseda little prematurly, on account of failing health.Elder Andrew Jenson has arrived in our Mission,and invis[i]ting two Northern districts, we had most pleasant times in Conferences with the saints.On the 5th we leave for the South to make a tourof the entire New Zealand Mission.The brethren all desired to be kindly remem-bered and are ever praying for the welfare of Zion.

Ridges have been released to return home and I have been compelled to borrow money for their re-turn fares, from Bro. Thos. Finlayson.  78.0.0.have been apportioned amongst them which should be placed to Thos. Finlayson's credit inthe "Zion's Savings Bank"; on the arrival of the Elders. Be kind enough to forward the receipt to me at your earliest conven-ience.Bro. Finlayson has offered to loan me the money for the return of seven Elders in Janu-ary, provided it be placed to his credit inthe Bank on the arrival of the brethren. ShallI accept the offer? It will save the trouble of sending the money here and also of having it changed, with which is connected more or less expense. All is well with all.I am as ever Your Brother in the GospelWm GardnerPrest. of Mission.I think it good to borrowthe money as proposed.J. F. S. 
 If you can render us any assistance in this matter, with the next company of Elders, it will be a great favor.  We need a large quantity of tracts, such as Morgan's No1 and 2.  (No 3 is unsuitable here.)Roberts "Second Coming" and Character of Mormon people, Rich's "True v. False religion, Budges 'Only true Gospel, Nicholsoen's tracts and any others that are suitable for general circulation on the First principles of the Gospel.If you have any spare copies of "Resources and attractions of Utah," as circulated at the Midwinter Fair we could use them to good advantage in all the public libraries of the Colonies.  I trust you will pardon me referring so urgently to this subject but there is such a demand for our church literature now, that I deemed it prudent to submit the matter for your consideration.I shall be pleased to receive counsel from you as often as circumstances will permit, and pray earnestly that God will continue to bless and prosper Zion.Your brother in the Gospel,William Gardner.Addressc/o J H.

 Auckland,New Zealand, Nov. 21st [18]94First PresidencySalt Lake City,Dear Brethren Your letter of Oct 15th, and also a letter from Secretary Reynolds with $200.00/100 enclosed came duly to hand.  I am also in receipt of literature sent by elders per "Monowai."For these accept my sincere thanks.The last company of elders reached Auckland safely and had had a health-ful and peaceful voyage.  After a few days visit in this city, they received their appointments as follows:  Elder Browning to labor in Auckland a-mongst the "Whites." elders Lasenby, Teeples and Waters amongst Maoris.There was much need of laborers for Europen fields, but owing to the destitue condition of most of the brethren, circum-stances compelled me to send them a- mongst the Natives, and that to districts, which for the time being, were supplied.However, from these places, elders will be released to return home in April and thus

 leave room for those lately sent there.Many of our brethren labor under the false impression that, if they have suffi-cient money to land them in Auckland that such is all that is necessary.This is a mistaken idea, as most have from one hundred to five hundred miles to their respective fields of labor.If this were batter understood, much embarrassment and inconvenience could be avoided.  Those called to labor amongstEuropeans need more or less money as they go.Immediately after the Annual Con-ference in April; Elders B. Goodard,J. E.Fisher, E J. Palmer, and M. C.

If cir-cumstances permit, will you be kind enough to forward money for their fares at your earliest convenience?The release of these brethren will ne-cessitate the appointment of others in their stead.

After a fewdays visit in this city, they receivedtheir appointments as follows: ElderBrowning to labor in Auckland a-mongst the  Whites.  elders Lasenby, Teeples,and Waters amongst Maoris.There was much need of laborers forEuropean fields, but owing to the destitutecondition of most of the brethren circum-stances compelled me to send them a-mongst the Natives, and that to districts,which for the time being, were supplied.However, from these places, elders will bereleased to return home in April, and thus 
 ed their fields at the Conference.I am gratified to be able to report that the condition of the Australasian "Missions is somewhat encouraging.  Elders from all parts write that the Lord is open-ing up the way before them, and that many are manifesting much interest in the Gospel. This causes my heart to swell with joy, and I sincerely trust, that, as elders in Israel we may be guided by the spirit of Jehovah, and be instrumen-tal in His hands of searching out the honest in heart, and be privileged to present unto them the Gospel of the Lord Jesus.The best of health now prevailsamongst our elders and we are en-deavoring to spread the truth as best we can under existing circumstances.God grant that we may fill our mission in favor before Him and that finally truth may triumph over all error.May the Lord prosper Zion and all her interests.Your brother in the Gospel.Wm Gardner.President Australasian Mission.We should take noticeand post the Elders &c.J.

 Christchurch Canterbury N. ZealandJuly 8th 1895President. Wilford, Woodruff,And CounselorsMy Dear Brethren  I take pleasure in informing you of the conditon of affairs in this Mission.We are all well, with the exceptions of Elders Stephensonwho has been aflected with sore eyes for some time; and Elder John Walker from Huntington who has been Ill ever since his arrival in the Mission, therefore I deem it wisdom to release him to return on the August Steamer as he has not been able to do any Missionary Labor as yet.He is troubled with liver complaint. And his head and eyes are bad, and he cannot study he will therefore Return in company with some of the Saints.The rest of the Elders are fully enjoying the Spirit of their Labors and I am happy to say the work of the Lord is progressing nicely in this Mission. New openings are being made and people are inviting the Elders to come and hold meetings in their school Houses, in a few instances,and nearly all the Elders are asking for more help.I haven't yet heard anything in relation to the lastcompany of Elder ordered. Nor the return fares for Elder Goddards Company  no doubt it will be hear next mail.  It will be nesessary to release Elder John F. Burton and James Barrows in the Month of September. Therefore if you will kindly send 
 Tamaki, Hawkes Bay,New Zealand April 9th 1895.President Wilford Woodruff,Beloved brother,I take pleasure in informing you that our Annual Conference has just closed and we have been blessed with an abundant outpouring of the Spirit of God. In our Sacrament meeting we had over 200 Visiting Europeans and hundreds of Maoris came from all parts of New Zealand. Thirty seven elders from the various Conferences in Australasia were present and the reports were highly satisfactory and encouraging. The work is progressing nicely in all our fields and we rejoice in these evidences of divine favor.A Company of Elders and Saints will leave Sydney on May 18th for Vancouver incharge of Elder B. Goddard.X We shall require, as early as possible, eight  more Elders, to fill vacancies that will shortly occur. Four will be required for Maori work and four to labor amongst Europeans.I also need an earnest experienced elder to take Supervision of The Conferences in Australia and Tasmania, with whom I 
 me the money for their return fare as soon as posible; as Elder Hardy is geting a little short at present and I am owing him  100.0.0 for return fare of Elder Goddards Company.If you can spare another Company of Elders we can use them to an advantagein the Mission ast there will be a large Company of Elders ^released^ about the last of the year and the first of the new one.I am quite well and enjoying myLabors very much. Ever praying for the welfare of Zionwith love and blessing to all.I remain your Brother and colaborer in the cause of TruthWilliam GardnerBox 236 AucklandNew ZealandAt least from 500$ to 800$, should be sent to bro. Gardner at once. Thesematters, relative to Samoa, New ZealandTonga, Northern States, & Cal. should be called up, and I think You bro.George, as Secretery, should do it, andI will assist you - J. F.

 could correspond continually as I am unable to visit them. Elder Goddard has just returned from an extended trip and, will be able to report to you fully on his return to Salt Lake City.X In a short time it will be necessary to release Elder Charles Peterson so please forward the requisite funds by returnmail.On account of your remittances for elder's return fares being so different, I am not sure what amount you desire me to pay to them. I have only paid the last two companies  25 each and if this is not correct please settle with the Elders at the Office. I feel impressed, however, to state that many of our Elders, are almost destitute when their terms expire, especially our Maori elders who are compelled to purchase clothing &c before they can commence their return journeys.Many of them also are great distances from Auckland & Sydney, and in some cases it costs about  4 to reach the port for American Sailings.I shall also esteem it a favor if you can possibly arrange to remit 
 funds in time for me to settle with the Elders, when their time expires as I have been compelled to borrow fromBro. Hardy several times of late in order to accomodate the returning Elders.With kind regardsI remain Your Bro. in the GospelWm Gardner.[sideways text] Wm Gardner Apl. 9 [18]95. [end of sideways text] 
 President Woodruff said he was pleased tosee the people, the labor done, and the country hewas favorably impressed all around.In regard to teaching the young as spoken of, hesaid when a boy he was taught by Professor whosePorter whose son is now Pres of Yale College. Hehad learned to quote scripture quite well.Was some prepared to receive the Gospel when presented. Always had a desire to serve good.After attending a protracted meeting whenabout twenty years of age (and a miller by trade)on attending a protracted meeting all was giventhe privilidge to speak. His morale was so beaton the work of God that he enquired of the ministeras to the gifts and powers of the Apostolic daysThey informed him he would be a useful man in society but, for those foolish notions,boy speaker remarked that he wished those darkages would come again. It has now come andwe are a part of it. Bro Woodruff had spent two thirds of his life connected with the principles taught by God through His prophets.Religion of Christ required union in prayersbuilding fences, church houses, ditches andall the helps and organizations such as ReleifSociety, Mutual Improvements, Primaries etc etc.We should be in unison with one another.All sisters should be members of Releif SocietiesAll young Brothers and sisters should belongto the Mutual Improvement Associations.So with the Sabbath Schools. The Lord organ-ized these institutions, as well as the Primaryto stay for the promulgation of His truths.These institutions were likened to a NurseryThere were forty thousand children in thesemountains to be trained daily. The younger 
 with primaries, elderly ones according to theircapacities. These institutions form ourcharacter for eternity. For these we ought tobe of all people the most thankful for His care.The eyes of the heavens and the earth are uponus. We cannot afford to sacrifice of our hopesof exaltation forever for anything upon theearth. By neglect ouof our duties we loose spiritof God then comes apostacy. He would ratherdie a thousand deaths than be devoid of thisspirit to cause him to fall away.The doctrine of Baptism for the dead was spokenof. It was a very important principle, somuch so that we could not fully comprehend.Fifty thousand millions of people who havelived since the days of Christ had to be administered for. No people but the L.D.S. had thatpower.Celestial Marriage was spokenof. The binding power of the Priesthood wasof inestimable value to all mankind.Gave his observations in a pecuniary point ofview as to the ones who practice this law andvice versa. While but one wife and onechild it was harder to get along, than when thehusband of several wives and many children.No person would occupy a celestial positionwithout a wife. No wife would be found^L D B.^ in the Terrestrial. We should not fightthe Celestial law. But desire to obey it.Lorenzo. D. Barnes who had died in Englandas one of the first elders without priviledgeof obeying it this law would be judged accord^80^ ingly. The speaker would be eighty year^3^ old in three days. Had quit quarrelling lon[g] 
 ago. Husbands be kind to their wives. Wivesbe kind to husband and children. Dontscold, scold, and drive. These Ephraim chil-dren are hard to drive. They can be lead, notdrove. Presidents Young, J. Taylor, Geo. Q. Cannonand many more were obedient to Joseph Smithyet such men could not be made slaves of.In regard to Ppolitics, put good men inoffice. [O]fficers work for the county goodand not feather your nests. Said that agreat immigration was sure to be the lotof this Stake. Spoke forty minutes.Choir sang "O give me back my prophet."Benediction by President Gunnell. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said we had met to partake of the emblems of the body and blood of Christ. No Latter Day Saint ought to be ashamed of being a follow-er of our Savior altho he came on this earth in a very humble condition. See how he suffered bled and died, while at the same time he had power to destroy those who were persecuting him. The prophet ^39 years^ Joseph Smith while in prison showed his devotion to God and his Christ, as witness his prayer at that time recorded in ##Doctrine & Covenants 121-122|Book of D&C page 121-2##:Altho the laws of the Jews did not allow one to administer in religious matters until thirty years of age, and was crucified about three years after^33 1/2^ See what mighty works he had done in so short 
 a time in organizing the church, performing miracles, etc. He was a very poor man. Did not have wherewith to pay his taxes until he sent Peter to catch a fish with money in its belly for that purpose. As Christ gave his life for others, so it was to be the same with others, Joseph Smith gave his life. It was necessary for the Testator to seal his testimony withtheir blood. It seems as though this was to be the case from before the foundation of the earth. Instead of having bad feelings towards our enemies such as congressmen and rulers, we should feel to pray for them. Had followed President B. Young to the penitentiary when arrested by order of Judge McKean. Had felt at the time that judgment ought to be passed on Judge McKean. Judge McKean had passed from this earth as though a nother. Shaefers experience in the edict against the saints, carrying sertain banners in pro-cession, had gone ^on^ very short notice. Numerous, other instances can be cited to show that "vengeance is mine, and I will repay it saith the Lord is verified."##Romans 12:19## Had seen the revelation on the late civil war in the United States twenty five years before it happened. 
 "I have resserved judgements for all my enemies" has been verified all through the states of Mo. That State suffered in kind, only in greater abundance, the punishment inflicted by them on the Saints while in their midst. It was far better to leave justice to God rather than take it in our own hands. This Kingdom is set up for ever. The Celestial Law of Marriagethe highest law he ever gave to the children of men. He will hold every man responsible for his own deeds. Spoke of Joseph Smiths prophecy to Stephen A. Douglas relating to his aspiring to the Presidency of the United States. When Douglas fought the Saints, by declaration, he went down in estimation of all men, and died poor. So it was with nearly all the Judges, Rulers & statesmen. God was attending to His business better than we should. We should pray. Learn to be prayerful. No man spends a day twice over. We are making character every day. Be careful how we form character.Infidelity is taking the world. The world is making rapid strides to overturn the religion of their fathers. Knew Tim Ham at one time to say that there was upwards of six hyndred 
 religions, all having different ways to heaven.Tim said when they got there there would be a "Hell of a heaven," the speaker thought sotoo. Exhorted all the priesthood to be alive totheir duties and callings. A priest or teacher ordeacon had power with the heavens just aswell as an Apostle had. Prayed God to blessall present and all Gods people. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff Spoke on the need of working together to care for our stock, cropsetc. Beleived it right for a Bishop to go to work as Prest Ricks had done. It was re-quired at the hands of every Latter Day Saint to be a worker in temporal as well as spiritual affairs. Had desired when he first embraced the Gospel, to preach ^to^ the nations of the earth. Since that time he had travelled far enough to go around the world six times as his diary would show. The religions of to day can not turn the hearts of our children away from the Gospel that is with them daily. They propose to do so, but they will fail. Live your religion live to your prayers. Show me a praying father, and I will show you praying children. Mothers have great power over their children. Their children look to them for guidance. Said God would bless our flocks, herds children, lands. The clerk then read a circular to President Ricks relating to Temple work in Cache Stake and its work and programme of labors. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said Bro Grant preached upon many principles this morning that were for our benefit if carried out. In re-gard to revelation, Joseph Smith was led the most of his life by revelation. So it is in regard to the living prophets and apostles. Jesus said straight is the way that leads to destruction and narrow is the path that leads to eternal life and few there be that find it. ##Matthew 7:13## There were Telestial, terristrial, and Celestial conditions of happiness. Those who earn one reward will not reap the reward of the other except yet be the greater absorbing the lesser glory. The Celestial law is unpopular, Gods truths were always so. He said He called them out of the world, con-sequently they were not of the world.##John 15:19## Gods truths were never popular, as the fulness of the Gospel is given to this generation it must embrace every principle advanced before time. Joseph Smith received the powers of the two priesthoods: The keys pertaining to the uniting of the dead to the living. The keys of gathering the scattered Israelites from all nations, and all other keys, knowledge, power necessary to obtain salvation in the presence of God and his associates. 
 The law of celestial marriage was one of these powers. The world do no understand us or these laws mentioned because they were in possession of the Spirit they were given in. We are not of the world, consequently, the laws we are given are different. There has not a person existed on the earth since the apostasy, immediately following the Apostolic dispen-sation that has administered with authority in any ordinance of the Church of Christ, for lack of the priesthood. There is no ordinance given by the father to man but what is necessary. Christ fulfilled the law of baptism to fill the law. No man can ignore a law of God with impunity. When the principle of baptism for the dead, about twelve years after the church was organized, was revealed, all felt to praise God. We neglected to keep a record of our baptisms consequently we had to do it over again.  The law of tithing is imperative and must be lived up to. If we do not, it shows lack of faith. This principle is being lived up to better than formerly. 
 The Word of Wisdom is well to be lived up to.Would not be over zealous in keeping any law.Said there Ira Haines of Wellsville killedhimself by leaving tobacco unwisely alone. Allwould be blessed in keeping Gods Word whether of Wisdom or any other principle. Said a verygreat Reformation was taking place for the better.The Lord would not give the Patriarchial Order of Marriage except it were for his benefit. Thelaw would exalt to the highest glory, as to the lowesthell. There is no blessing without sacrifice.The greater sacrifice, the greater blessing.The blessing to Abraham to outnumber the sands of the sea shore ##Genesis 22:17## with his posterity must have tobe lived up to in a future state. This law is the strength of future greatness. I say in the 
 name of Israels God, there is no person, man or woman who has obeyed this law but what willbe exceedingly rewarded for their sacrifice.If you cannot gather strength to live it, dontfight it. Leave it alone, that you may not belowered in what would be otherwise be your reward.The history of those who fight this law amongthe Gentiles is not to be sought after. Allwho obey this law will be blessed. After thepassage of the Edmunds Law, had every sonof Israel took him another wife, I believeGod will would deliver this people. It takea life of righteousness, as well as many wives,to obtain exaltation. A man must treatall his wives alike. No favors to one at expense of another. Bear and forbear with one another.When a man faithful man passes to anotherworld his work goes on. He labors for his wives and his families until he attains exaltation.There is a temporal blessing attached to the living this law. My wives are each one better 
 provided for than I ever was before enteringinto this law. So it is in regard to all the leadingmen in the Church. So it always would be,both in this life and the life to come.Dont be afraid to obey this law. But be prudentAs the children of Israel would rather live upto the laws of God than bow to Belshassars God Baal and so receive His blessing. Sowill the Latter Day Saints. Contrary witnessthe biography of the rulers, judges and greatmen of the nation who fight this work and you find their destruction commencesat that time. It pays to keep the commandsof God. The closer the Latter Day Saints liveup to His laws, the more we are blessed.We are the finest people on the earth at the present time. Young men, pray. 
 Priesthood After the Prophet J. Smith hawasplaced in prison he uttered the prayer cited inBook of D&C, page [blank space] also read the answer.The question why did Oliver Cowdery and a greatmany others fall? It was because they forgotthe power of the Priesthood. They looked to thethings of this world. Every portion of the priest-hood has power with the heavens by faithfulnessI had the greatest power manifest in mybehalf when on my first mission while aPriest. I travelled ten thousand miles in that capacity. I went a thousand mileswith the prophet Joseph while I was a Teacher.I say magnify your callings, deacons, teacherspriests and Elders. This is given us to magnify.All heaven is watching over us. I thank God forthese Temples where we can officiate for ourancestry. I wish the vail could be liftedfrom the face of this people so they would see thenecessity of attending Temple ordinances.President Taylor and myself are the only personsliving of the Twelve who received our anointings andendowments at the hands of the Prophet JosephSmith in Kirtland.minutes77 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it was indeed wonderful to note the moves of the work of the Lord. The leaders of the Johnson army hasabout all passed away, mostly in a summary manner. The Lord has fulfilled a great many revelations in the past fifty years. I do not know of a single soul of those mobocrats or their sons who have embraced the Gospel. I speak of the Illinois and Missouri mobs. But great were the trials of those States, and many were their sufferings in kind the same as what they inflicted on the Saints while in their midst. Gen Doniphan had testified that he had witnessed many of the words of Joseph Smith fulfilled.The prophecy of the brother of Jared as recorded in Book of Mormon in relation to the government of this land would be truly fulfilled. [##Ether 4:4##] When this nation refused to avenge the death of the martyrs, they allowed their blood to cry from the ground against them. They got blood, in the civil war. This people would be a great people yet. They had God on their side. The Lamanites would be a great help in spreading the Gospel. Had travelled a great experience among them. The first time I spoke to one company they kept me till one 
 o'clock. They were very inquisitive as to theirancestors. One old lady spoke and said"When a girl her mother said that some whitemen would come from the west who would tellthem about their ancestors. A great workis being fulfilled through them.If we do our duty, God is with us. Zion must haveroom to grow. You are going to have a greatcity here, a great country, be faithful. GoThis Kingdom will grow and increase. There isa warfare between truth and error. Truthwill come off conqueror. God bless you, getyour work done that is needful to do. Ican carry a good report of you and your laborsand country. Pleased I came to visit. 
 ReadP.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus.Feb 10th  1898.First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ,of Latter-day Saints.Beloved Brethren:I write you a few lines that you may learn of the safe arrival of Elders Frederick E. Barker and Charles D. Fox, on the 6th inst.wWhen they came to Sydney. On account of the missunderstanding of the arrival of the S. S. Miawerra, they had no one to meet them either by person or letter. aAlthough I received no word of their coming still I was impressed there might be some one or more. Elder Barker did not realize any effect of Sea sickness. but elder Fox was very bad at times and gave elder Barker to understand that if the rough weather continued much longer he was afraid he could not stand it but he looks acceplright, and although he was so bad, we had a hearty laugh after it was all over and the pittiful story was related to us. There does not seem to be much sympathy extended to sea sick persons, as very few die but the reverse they seen to get so that many, at least, are better able to enjoy their meals than before the ordeal they are called to pass trough.

 Elder Fox will leave 11th inst for Melbourneto labor with Elders H. W. Barton and Enoch L. ReeseElder Barton has been poo^r^ly in health for some time andwill be released to return to Zion as soon as we can raisemeans or rather receive some from home.Elder Barker will go to Brisbane 12th inst.to assist Elder Wm Armstrong in the QueenslandConference, and as Wm Armstrong will be calledto labor with relatives in the course of a few monthsElder Barker will, I believe, be able to take upthe lead of the work in that conference. am wellpleased with the elders sent, have been able toplace two good men capable of doing their partin the possitions placed.Some of the elders have had poor healthlately but when the hot weather is over, as thereis nothing serious in their illness es, they will beall well again.The work is quietly making way into thefamilies of the honest and I believe we can lookfor some fruits of the labor performed by theelders. there have been, I believe, eight baptismsperformed and several children blessed since I lastwrote you and look for more in the near future.I am well and desire to do my part. Igo to Brisbane in company with elder Barker.I hope each of you are in the enjoymentof good health, and pray God to bless you.

I willnot say anything to them regarding the arrangmentsbefore I get word from you.There is much that could be done here inAustralia if Elders were here to the amountnecessary. It seems a few do not cause enough stirin getting the people to take the interest I wouldlike to see. There are many, from the work theElders are doing, believe what we teach to be thetruth and do not join because of the great prejudiceand the slowness ^of the work^ and many dwindle away fromthat which we have been able to instil into theirminds by there not being enough encouragmint; fromour labors.[upside-down text] Scott W Anderson arrived safe at Sydneyafter a pleasant voyageA.

 We could put one hundred Elders in the City of Sydney, or Melbourne, and there would be agreat deal for them to do.I would be pleased if such could be thecase, that that number could be sent to Sydney.To show you how little a few Elders areknown by the masses, Since the last opening upof the work at Sydney, ^they^ knew nothing aboutElders laboring in Sydney.There was a very untruthful piecepublished about our people and we deemed itwise to answer it, and the people were surprisedto know that we had been here so long, and hadbeen doing the work that we reported in answerto the piece, and it took the Editor, (from thesurprise of our being here) several weeks to getover what he had done and get on hiswicked head again to give us another blowingup.We had the satisfaction of gettingour Articles of Faith published and a fewgood words of advise regarding our causeand felt we had done our part withoutslander.We have at the present 21 Elders in the Mission and could work many more if we had them. The Elders are all enjoying goodhealth and are doing what they can in allayingprejudice, gaining friends, and the Lords is blessingsome with fruits for the labors performed.

 In the City of Launceston, Tasmania, Elders havebeen laboring for some time and have met withno apparrent success until ^quite^ recently. Thesubaurbs are being tracted and the work is goingon nicely, there are about 16 members andquite that number who are preparing themselvesto have the ordinance of baptism performedthat they can be properly initiated into the true fold of Christ. There are some very nicepeople in the Island of Tasmania and Ibelieve a good work can be done.I feel that the Elders in this missionare doing the Cause justice, the stamp oflove is written ^in^ the demeanor of the great majorityof them and is growing stronger with themday by day, and I am thankful to our HeavenlyFather for the privilege I have of laboring amongsuch noble sons.I also thank God and you that I havebeen call to this far Southern Clime, andthat such honor is placed upon me, it is something I never looked for. I like the callingof travelling Elder too well to ask for any thinghigher but as I understand that we are expectedto improve, and if we prove faithful in theexalted possitions we are called to fill we willbe blessed. otherwise if the office and calling isdesecrated, a curse instead of a blessing is given. 
 AnsweredWCSP.O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W.Friday April 22nd 1898.President Wilford Woodruff. and Councillors,Beloved Brethren:Your letterto me with instructions (to me) as to what youdesire will be carried out to the very letterif possible. I do not think I will beable to leave Sydney before the 18th ofJune, as the work to be done will keep mehere (in the Colonies) until after the leavingof the May boat.The agency at Sydney have not receivedany instructions from Mr Coyle up to date.Two mails have come since I receivedletter from Geo. Reynolds informing meof the arrangments made between youand the agent at Vancouver. I believe thechangs^ing^ of the agency, from the Huddard ParkerCo. to the Burns Philip's S.S. Co at Sydneyhas caused them to overlook the latter parti.e. the instructions they should have sentto Sydney. I have two men released from their labors and if word does not comebefore the next boat leaves it will verymuch inconvenience them. If they haveoverlooked it entirely I may be delayedin my return, there have been two otherelders released to leave Sydney June 18th

 Regarding the traveling to the differentconferences, they being so far apart, thenearest is 500 miles Shanks povies are very good but it takes quite a time and Ibelieve a great amount of time wasted to walkand this would not reach them all, it isan expensive mission for the size to do anytraveling. Prest Richards and myself were upto Brisbane and were well paid for our visitThe cheapest way is by boat more time etc savedThe mission is in a poor condition to keep aPresident if traveling expences are paid unlesshe gets help from other sourses he will eitherhave to be content to remain in one place and payhis way when he is able to. I would like you toadvise me what to do in this matter. I believeif the Elders and Saints were visited once ina while much good could be done andwould pay for the expence in time.The following address could be given to Elderscoming to Sydney, Australia. No 30 Malcolm StreetErskineville Sydney N. S. W. the above address is ourheadquarters. Also I would be pleased if Elderswould enquire for letter directed Care of Second Stewardthis will have instructions, as to what I would desire them to do.[sideways text]Cannot a furnish money from here to travel[end sideways text] 
 Elder Barker is at Brisbane arrang-ing the work in that part and willbe in Sydney after the 1st of May.All being well we will travel togethermaking a visit at Launceston & Hobart,Tasmania, and Melbourn & probablyBallarat Victoria. After all business isperfected between elder Barker and your humbleservant, I will make some inquiries concerningsome of my relatives who live in these parts,who I have not had addresses of until the  last Vancouver mail, then I will be pleasedto return home.I feel greatful for the ^your^ appreciation ofmy labors in the missionary cause, andthe little good that has been accomplishedI appreciate, and in return I give our HeavenlyFather praise and Honor for it all. I knowthe Lord has been with me in my travelsand work among the people, (Saints and strangers)for my thick head would never have been ableto do the little good that has been pleasingfor me to look upon, then it was not meit was the Lord, I being His humbleInstrument through whom He did the work.With love for the work I amengaged in, I remain a servant of the Lord.Andrew Smith Jr.Pres

 Andrew Smith JrJan. 26 [18]98P. O. Newtown, Sydney, N. S. W. Aus.Jan 26th 1898.Wilford WoodruffAnd Councillors.My Beloved Brethren:Several months ago,President E. F. Richards, in order that he could learnfrom the Missionary elders to a certain extent the labors performed by them, formed a report which he desired each elder to fill out immediately after the end of each month, there being some time during the 24 hours of each day that I have not been given account of and which I thout essentialI have added more for the elders in my part to fill out.There are some elders who put in very little timeand having something of the nature diagramed for the elders to report upon. The president is able to suggest where he would otherwise be at a loss, at times, to offer suggestions or give advise to the elders, and they having a form to work to can understand to a certain extent the labor required of them. Some will average 2 & 3hours per day. while others, laboring under the same circumstan-ces average 6 & 8 hours and if we had no report given 
 nan 
 of labors performed each month, many of the elders would be robing the Lord and that possibly not knowingly.The work of the Lord is prospering throughout the Mission, although not many ^are^ added to the Faith yet. tThosewho have joined are endeavoring to serve the Lord and are being educated in the glorious Gospel.We have two very interesting Sunday Schools which are attended by Saints and outsiders. also two very interesting M. I. A., and the saints are getting grounded in the work of the Lord and it does my heart good to hear them bear testimony to the devinity of the work they have engaged themselves to.Some of the elders do not seem to take the council of the inspired Servants at home when setting them apart to missions. and there will be something said and done if they, the elders when they come on missions do not leave the girls alone and cease making love to them, there are some here, and where I have learned of the same, I have given them the information that they were disobeying council. and I could not and would not countenance their actions. The health of the elders is generally good. With love and best wishes for you and yours, and all the Saints. I am your brother in the Gospel Andrew Smith Jr.Pres.

 P.O. Newtown, Sydney N. S. W. Aus.Sat. NApril 9th 1898.Pres. Wilford Woodruff,and CouncillorsMy Beloved Brethren:I thinkyou would be pleased to learn from this part of the Lords vinevard occassionally and therefore I occupy myself at the present time, to inform you of some of the good accomplished since my last to you.When elder Fred E. Barker arrived at Sydney arrangments were made for him to go to Brisbane, and Elder C. D. Fox who arrived with him to labor as a traveling elder in Victoria.I decided to go to Brisbane with elder Barker and during my stay there I was taken down witha fever known in these parts as the Dengue it seems to be a complications of complaints in the system, a number of the elders have also been affected with the same.The work of the Lord in that part, (Brisbane) is moving along nicely, after witnessing the ordinance of baptism performed, also assisted in the confirmation. Organized a Relief Society with officers and aids numbering ten in all. Ordained one teacher, and two deaconcts, the M.I.A being in a disorganized state for a short timewas reorganized, and introduced some ideas (new to the members) in the sunday school. a good spirit 
 nan 
 nan 
 prevailed, and the saints were satisfied that the Lord had a hand in all that had been done for the progress of the work in that part.Elder Wm Armstrong was honorably released frompresiding in the Queensland Conference, granted the opportunity of Laboring among his many relatives in N. S. W. Fred E. Barker was appointed to preside in elder Armstrongs stead.Several elders have been sent out to labor where opportunity has been better given to spread the work and warn the people.Instructions have been given and arrangments are made to hold conferences ^tomorrow 10th^ at Sydney, Brisbane,and Launceston, and a good time is anticipatedI received the letter from Geo Reynolds, inform-ing me of the arrangments between you and the C.P.S.S. Agent, will no doubt learn of the instructions to their agents in Sydney the 12th inst. would have been able to tell you of the perfected arrangments at this writing if there was not so many holly-dayshere at the present time, no business being done from good Friday until after Easter Monday.I will acknowledge the receipt of the letter from Bro Reynolds to me.With love and best wishes for you in ^the^ multitudinous duties you are called to perform, I remain a weak instrument in the work of the Lord.Andrew Smith Jr.Pres

 Old Cleveland Road, Coorparoo, Brisbane,Queensland, Australia, April 18, 1898.Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,and Joseph F. Smith,Salt Lake, Utah.Beloved Brethren:Your letter of March 8th, apprising me of the honorable release of Elder Andrew Smith, Jr., from theposition of President of the Australian Mission and appoint-ing me to that position, came to hand to-day.While feeling keenly the sense of my weakness and un-worthiness thus to be honored with this important and veryresponsible station, I feel very thankful to receive in con-nection therewith your prayers and blessing, which I prizeabove all things of the earth.I have felt the blessings of God so far with mein this mission, and I am now constrained to saythat with the same continued upon me (which I shallclaim, and believe I shall have, in redoubled measure) Iwill do my best in every way to merit the confidencereposed in me by you and to further the interests of thismission, so far as may lie in my power.I was about a month ago installed here in the po-sition of  Pres't of the Queensland conference, taking the placeof Bro. Wm Armstrong, who went to labor at Sydney amonghis relatives 
 nan 
 There is a branch here of abt. 70 souls, and the care of this with its various organizations (R.S., S.S., M.I.A., Priesthood meetings, etc.)makes a field for considerable labor, vigilence and activity onthe part of the president of the conference stationed here. Iam glad, however, to have had the experience afforded metherein, as well as that gained by laboring among strangers,wherein I have tried to be fully active.Some changes have been made, two Elders have been appoint-ed to a new, and, we believe promising, field, and weconfidently expect some fruit of our labors in the near future. This mission now presents an apparently barren field, however, there being so much indifference toreligion in general and so rarely sufficnt virtue andzeal to impel the people to even attempt to live a religionrequiring what the Gospel does.It is my belief that later on we shall reap somefruit in this land, though at present it looks discourag-ing. In some cases Elders have lived in and tracted a neigh-borhood for many months without seeing much good result, fur-ther than making some kind friends.There are a few good people now investigating, who, I be-lieve will yet yield obedience to the Gospel message.Your ob't servant and brother in the Gospel,F. E. Barker.Future Add. Newtown P.O. Sydney,N. S. W., Australia.P.S. I should be pleased to be informed if it is now contemplatedthat in any case worthy local talent may be called to labor in the mis-sion field as in assisting in tracting, etc., and if so in what manner the call should be made.

AUSTRALIA.52 Burren Street, Erskineville, Sydney, May 22, 1898.Prests. Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith, Salt Lake, Utah.Dear Brethren:There are now 22 Elders laboring in this mission, two of whom are released to return homenext month, (June [18]98).In case others are released after being 2 1/2 yearsin the field (as has heretofore been the rule of practice) therewill be two more to be released before Oct. next, and threeduring that month, thus reducing the number from 22 to 15, not counting any hereafter to arrive. EldersRudolph Korth and Jno. B. Mathias arrived on the 10th inst.,and have gone to their fields of labor.We shall be under some difficulties at once toprosecute the work now under way, and could easily usedouble the force now in the field. There are numbersof places where I believe openings could be made tosome advantage, as where we already have one or more members or friends. Elders who could speakGerman would be specially valuable in some parts.There have been four baptisms within the past month.Your Brother in the Truth,F. E. Barker.Let us send from two to three each each month until he shall besupplied at least with fromsix to 12 Elders one or two good German speakers J. F. S

 Br. Woodruff said:The Lord told Joseph Smiththat he was laying the foundation of a great work, buthe knew it not. He felt this was the case withthese Relief Societies. Referred to the discoursesof some of our returned missionaries, both fromthe North & the South. They all testified of thewant of virtue & of the degeneracy of society.Spoke of the great labor which lies beforethe Saints. The L.D.S. do not realize it.Pres. Young is capable of instructing us: heis called of God to lead. Zion is not yet es-tablished in its beauty & glory. Spoke of ourchildren: noble spirits who have come here to bearoff the Kingdom. There are many spirits yetto come: also many which are waiting for usto do a work for them. Some men willhear a sermon an hour long, & then go forth& trade with our enemies. A great responsabilityrests upon both men & women in this respect.Our leaders are abundantly inspired to leadus. Beleived that this people are advancing, areimproving. We are not going to stay here long, buthave a tremendous work to do. He should hateto go into the spirit world & have his fathers &mothers ask him why he had not performedthis work or that for them 
 Sundays past the assembly has been addressed by Prest. Kimball atlength in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothedwith the Spirit and power of God, so that he has freely satisfied his mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, weor our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified andbenefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowdedto excess during the evening meeting. Brother F. D. Richards & [my]self beingthe only ones of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionaries with the assistance of Prest. Grant, under the directions of Prest. Youngto preach throughout this city, all the wards during Winter have metin the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the wordof the Lord. We have attended a meeting of some kind about everyevening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests,Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confinedto reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism forthe remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood,prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing,seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani-festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for ourblessings. Elders O. Hyde & L. Snow were with us during the settingof the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors & the Spirit & power of God has rested upon us in our labors. ElderHyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost in mass arerising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the Reform-ation, confessing their sins and restoring what they have done wrong. Meetingsare crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere issencirly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren & live their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down vice &iniquity in all the forms. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a fewof the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince & Co[mpan]y.as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we wouldalso wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bearin mind, the propriety of bringing with them or forwarding as theymay have opportunity any choice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will bea benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedlingstrawberries or any other good kinds Lawton's Huckberry, Calamba & Isabella Grapes,Indigo or madder or cotton seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane orMillet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seedsand grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite abenefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.The Reformation is progressing thoughout this city and Territory withgreat interest. President Young has given much valuable information andteaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attendthe meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant onthe 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with hiscounsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H. Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernaclewas crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter andhundreds have to leave who cannot get into the house, the appearanceof Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months createda sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for aboutone hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to thepeople, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the heartsof the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful.He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses willappear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people forseveral Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 Bro. Taylor,  I have named in my letter that I wished toget the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel tosee something about it, but not knowing that he will be ableto do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00and direct him to put up that amount, and send it toW.

His lungs are very feeble, and have been much impaired by his continuous speaking.  Wewould like him to have a respite from thelabor of preaching, and therefore, in consul-tation with him, have concluded to appointyou as President for the time being in theNorth Western Mission.We have requested Bro. Palmer to continue hisoversight of the mission. We know that hisheart is in the work, and that he is familiarwith that field; therefore, we shall dependupon suggestions from him from time to 
 2time.  Whatever information you have tocommunicate, however, concerning the affairs ofthe mission, we trust you will send it to myOffice, so that we may have it there to referto in case we should think it necessary.In appointing you to this labor, we beseechGod, our Eternal Father, to abundantly qualifyyou, for the great responsibility which rests uponyou, to endow you with every gift and grace, and to make you equal to every labor andemergency. If you seek the spirit of revelation, you will receive all that is necessary to enableyou to counsel the Elders, over whom you arecalled to preside, in regard to their labors, andthat which is best to do to make them successfuland also concerning the organization of Branches, Conferences, and opening new fields, and everythingnecessary to enable you and your fellow laborersto thoroughly warn the people throughout the stateswhere you are called to labor.With love, and praying the Lord to be with you, to preserve you from the hands of all your enemies,I RemainYour BrotherW.

Palmer,Dear Brother:In relieving you from the responsibility of the Presidency of the Northern States Mission, or, as it was formerly called, the North Western States Mission, we feel that it is but justice to you to express our feelings concerning the labors which you have performed while acting in that capacity. Your services have been most satisfactory, and the only fault that we have felt to find with you, if we were to attempt to find any, has been that you have not been sufficiently careful of your own health and have exerted yourself to an extent that we feared might undermine your constitution. You have been exceedingly diligent in the performance of your labors, and the work has prospered under your presidency. We have regretted that your health and other circumstances have been such as to compel us to release you.No doubt, the remembrance of your labors will live in the memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in the memories of the Elders who have been associated with you, and also in thememories of the souls who, through your instrumentality as a servant of God, have been brought to the knowledge of the truth.

 We ask God the Eternal Father to bless you in all your labors, to give you strength and grace to endure every trial, and to enable you to maintain your integrity even unto the end, that you may be crowned, with the souls that you have helped to save, in the celestial kingdom of our God.We remain Your brethren and fellow-servants,Wilford WoodruffGeo.
