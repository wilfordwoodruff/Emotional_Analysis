Our boat was drawn out of the canal  on cars prepared to run on the railroad to  convey us over the Allegany mountain which  is a novel scene indeed to see a canal boat  taken apart into 4 sections loaded with freight  and passengers and hoisted on a rail road by inclin  plains into the air 1500 feet over the highest  mountains and then desend into the valley below  in the same way and evry rod is attended with  the greatest danger and what adds dread to the   ENDENTRY is having carless men in attendance who  seem indiferent bothe to their business and the  lives of men, which was apparent during  this days scene at least     But to the detail. Horses was hiched to our  cars drew us four miles and a half then we come  to the first incline plaine which we had to rise two cars wer fassened at the top of the plain  to the same rope that ours was fassened to at  the bottom, the engine was stationed in a build- ing at the top of the plain that drew the  cars up and down when all was ready the signal  was given by raising a red flag the engine  was put in operation and the cars started, this  Plain was a half a mile long and raised 180 feet we went up in 2 minutes, and I was truly  thankful to reach the top for had the  rope broak or fastning untied we should  have rolled back to the bottom with a tremen- dious crash, we were then carried on to  Plaine No. 2, which raised 125 feet in half a  mile our boat rocked badly while going  up but No accident hapened. we then  continued on a level untill we came to the  incline plane No 3. this was one mile and a quartr  long and raised 320 feet which we went up in  4 minutes before we reached the top the  safty car that was attached to our boat was  flung from the track which draged many  rods and flung the roap of the wheels for  10 or 12 rods I made a signal to the engeneer  who stoped and it was replaced, here again  we were in danger of breaking the rope  which would have sent us back down the  mountain more than a mile or turned us   ENDENTRY over into the yauning gulf below in either case  we would have been dashed to atoms my hare  rose on my head, but having got all things  ready we proceded on to plane No 4. 3/4 of a  mile long and assended 265 feet we rose this in 3 min  but it looked awful to be thus suspended almost  in the air with such a wait lives and freight  depending upon an not, a twine, a rope a pin an  engine, care of a man either of which should  give way all would be dashed to atoms unless  saved by miracle. we next continued onto  plain No 5. 3/4 of a mile long 280 feet rise we  were carried up this also in 3 minutes, which  brought us on to the summit of the Allegany  mountains. The whole 5 incline plains  on our assending the mountain are four miles  in length which raises us perpendicular 1,170  feet and I felt thankful to God that I was on the  top of the mountain alive but we had got to  desend in the same way that we assended, we  run on the top of the mountain about 5 miles and  then began to desend we found snow on the  top of the mountain and it was exeeding cold we had 6 incline planes to desend to get to the  bottom of the mountain, the whole of which  was attended with equal danger and carelessness as we came upon the brink of one of them the  Cars being drawn by horses, the men had left the  breakers the conductor seeing the cars coming  and about to run onto the Horses He hollowed hallooed for  the men to break but finding no one at the break ers and the cars approaching the incline plain the team- ster liberated his horses as soon as possible and they  Just escaped being run over and the conductor  sprung to the breaker himself and with great   ENDENTRY exhertion merely saved it from runnind down the plain, which would have dashed it  to attoms I was standing in the cars at the  time I instantly flung my cloak from my  sholdiers shoulders and prepared myself from  leaping out of the cars in case it should start  down the plain in either case it might have  killed me but I knew it was certain death to  go down the plain but through the mercy of  God they were stoped before they began to desend the whole distance was a constant scene of  danger, and I called upon God in my heart to  preserve my life even while on a level we were  running on the edge of precpices hundreds of feet  deep which if a wheel should break or run  off the track the cars would shurely be  plunged down the precepices which would  make an end of all flesh that was on board we passed through one tunnel in the mount ain and when we reached the bottom of the  incline plaines I felt thankful to God and felt  that we were mostly out of danger but they  put the boat together and started it on the rail  with all on board without horse or steem and  the rail road being a little desending it increased in  speed untill it run at a rapid rate and was still  in danger of upsetting it run of itself 4 miles  untill it came to the canal whare it was to take  water and here again to finishe the day with  danger a train of cars was left in our track  and with all the power that could be exherted  on the breaks we bearly mised of having  a smashe up at last, we finally got rolled  into the water alive with no bones broakin  or lives lost and for one I had a glad heart   ENDENTRY while conversing with the mate in the evening on  the subject he remarked that we were not sensib- le of one half of the danger that we were in  during the procedings of that day but I was  sensible of a good deal at least we got into the  canal about dark being 36 miles from  canall to canal in crossing the mountains we travled all night in the canal which  was one constant scene of locks    ENDENTRY October 20, 1843 ~ Friday   20th The boat I was on was the Robroy owned  and commanded by Capt Bennett of the line of  Gregg and Bellows and Co we saw the Captains  farm and stoped 30 minutes at it we passed through  the tunnel on the canal under a mountain  900 feet long arched overhead    ENDENTRY October 21, 1843 ~ Saturday   21st We arived in Pittsburgh at 10 oclock A.M.  and unloaded our freight at the wharf I called  upon several of the Brethren those in Strawbury lane  and Br Savory the Presiding Elders Wellingford and  Taylor was the house whare my goods was left the whole distance from Philadelphia to Pitts- burghh was 400— miles     I immediately went on board of the Alps and  ingaged my freight carried to St Louis for  30 cts per cwt and I took it all on board and  went on myself and started at 5 oclok got to  E Snow with a compay  of about 50 saints    ENDENTRY October 22, 1843 ~ Sunday   22nd Sunday left wheeling and spent the night I finished reading Stephens travels and found them highly interesting Elder  E Snow and his company took passage on the   ENDENTRY North Bend.

Durphy a family  that I was acquainted with in Canida in  1838 they appeared glad to find me out we traveld  well through the day but the boat was so crouded  that half the people could not lie down or hardly  sit down. I had the good fortune to get a bunk  for myself But I gave it up for two of the  children sisters with children I parted with  Friend wife about 10 oclock in  the evening who were landed home we had been  together all the way from Philadelphia he  was believing in our doctrin    ENDENTRY October 24, 1843 ~ Tuesday   24th The morning plesant and fair sun  shines Bright But our company is vary thick    ENDENTRY October 25, 1843 ~ Wednesday   25th It is a rainy morning I was not well I  was nearly rosted out with a hot stove and the  deck was stoved so thick with Black and white  male and female that they could scarsly stand arived in Cincinnati at 11 'oclok called upon  Br Baker in Elm st Between 5 and 6 st I  Bought a stove of him for $26, for which  I, gave him my note payable in two months    ENDENTRY October 26, 1843 ~ Thursday   26th Got all of my freight on board of the  Govornor Brethrett and she started at 1 oclok  loaded down to the guards and crowded to overflowing   ENDENTRY Paid fare on the Alps to St Louis $2.50 had a rainy damp  and a snow storm through  the night    ENDENTRY October 27, 1843 ~ Friday   27th Arived in Louisville at 4 oclok in the  morning I visited Kelloggs paper ware house bought a bottle of writing ink 54 cts 1844  Almanack $2.00 I visited Morton and Griswold  Paper Warehouse the largest one in the city  and Bought 3 quire of marble paper at 75 cts per qr  $2.25 got their samples of paper and prices con  do better than in the eastern market considering  freight andc. Returned to the Boat Remained  in Louisville untill 8 oclok in the evening  being 10 hours in Louisville before we cleared  the locks I never was in a worse mess to  travel with. we had a cold night    ENDENTRY October 28, 1843 ~ Saturday   28th A plesent morning but cool travel well  through the day, word got into the cabin that I was a mormon as is called and a preacher  and many came to see me Mr Ill was  one and Mr J Abel came came down after I was in  bed and asked me many questions about Joseph  Smith and mormonism the plates andc these things  was the topic of conversation continually on  the river. I Bunked part of the time with  a missouri Baptist Priest. I have taken  cold and some reumatism as their is a stream of  water running near their my head on the wall    ENDENTRY October 29, 1843 ~ Sunday   29th Sunday I arose in the morning with my  Reumatism griping me through the sholdiers Mr Abel was ready to renew the subject of mormonism and when he had done others comme- nced we reached the mouth of the ohio abou 1 oclock and I was glad to get so near home   ENDENTRY Sept All the prophesies have aimed at the gathering  of the people and saving of them in the last days.  But my advise is if you cannot take hold of  the work and go through the whole course to stop and  go no further, we do not want to deceive you Our traditions have been to be vary religious  weare long faces, never tell a story or laugh andc this was the case with the long faced Christians in  Mo and they were the first to strike a dagger to the  our hearts. If I wear a strange hat it is not  because of my religion for whare the religion  of a man is in his hat or coat it is not vary extensive  any whare els. And whenever I have seen Elders  trying to preach sumthing large to get a name the  mysteries andc I have believed that such have got yet  much to learn. As many are desireous of hearing  mysteries I will rehears a short sermon or misteriy Elder Kimball has been of long standing in the  Church Preached much, done much good, brought  many souls into the kingdom and had great influene  andc. Elder Amasa Liyman and myself went into  a place to preach whare the Elders had preached  all the mysteries, they wanted us to preached  mysteries, we told them we were not qualified  to preach miysteries but if they would send  for Elder Kimball he could preache the mysteries so they sent abot 40 miles for Elder Kimball  and brought him down as they were so anxious  to hear the mysteries and when he came, he  had a large congregation assembled and he arose  before them and remarked that he had understood  they had sent for him to come and preach the  mysteries to them. I am fully competent  to do it and am happy of having the privilege  And I want the attention of all, and when   ENDENTRY evry mind was streached eager for the  mysteries. He says the first miystery I shall  present before you is this. Elder Amasa  Lyman wants a Pair of Pantaloons, and it is a  great mystery that an Elder in this church should  want a pair of Briches, and esspecially that  the people should know that they want it and  the remainder of his miysteries were like unto  and the consequence of this serman was that Elder  Lyman got a pair of Pantaloons and Elder Kimball  a Barrel of flour for his family.   Elder B. Young arose and said I will make an apology  for my remarks in the fore part of the day some may think I spoke vary plain. But the  Apology I have to make is I will turn Tompsonian  doctor and give the composition without sweetning This work is all, it is my all. If this work does  not live God knows I dont want to live, And I  want you to understand it, that he that gathereth  not with us scattereth. And they that have tasted  the bitter cup feel it. Wake up ye Elders that  have sought to build yourselves up and not the king- dom of God. Wake up ye that have daubbed  with untempered morter. Harken and hear me  for I say unto you that if you do not help us build  the Nauvoo House, you shall not inherit  the land of Zion. If you do not help build up  Zion and the cause of God you shall not partake of  their blessings. Many Elders seek to build them- selves up and not the work of God. But when any  one does this no matter who he may be he will  not prosper even if it was one of the Twelve Those of the Twelve and others of the Elders that  have apostitized I have known their hearts   ENDENTRY their breathings and known their moovments they thought I did not know much but I knew  all about them, and when I see men preaching  to build themselves up and not Zion I know what  it will end in. But say you I am young I  dont care if you are young do you know what  you are about, if so Preach and labour for  the building up of the City of Zion concentrat  your means and influence there and not scatter  abroad. Be faithful or you will not be chosen  for the day of chosing is at the door, why  be afraid of a sacrafice I have given my all  many times and am willing to do it again. I  would be glad to hear the Lord say through m  his servant Brigham  give again all that he has. I would obey in a  moment if it took the last coat off from  my Back   Elder Kimball sayes I get up of necessity to say a few words I am quite unwell, But I feel  the importance of this work. I have been a  member of this Church 12 years I came out of  the Baptist Church and Joined this and I have passed  through evry thing but death, and we have come  here to call for help to build the Houses and I  have spent $30 to get here and collected $15 dollars We were commanded to come of the Lord But  it seems as though but few felt interested in it Here I see three Brethren going to the far  distant Islands. I could weep for them they have  but little money to help themselves. I feel inter- ested in this great work we have come out to  Reep but do we have time to Reep new grain   ENDENTRY No for it takes all our time to try to save the  that is reaped you think that Elder Young  has put the flail on rather heavy. But it is  nothing to be compaired with the Threshing  you will get in Zion, and those that have the harde- st heads have to be thrashed the hardest,  but dont be troubled about the chaff when  it comes to the barns God will prepare a great  wind Mill that will blow all the chaff away I speak in Parables. I compare the Saints  to a good cow, when you milk her clean she  will always have an abundance of milk to give, but  you milk her a little and she will soon dry up So with the Saints if they do but little in building  up Zion they soon have but little to do with, this  was the case in Cincinnati I had a dream concerning  the saints there. I thought I was in a field of  wheat that was stacked up and we had got to draw  it into the barn come to open the stack the bun- dles would all fall to peices and it was filled  with clusters of Rats and mice, who had been  eting up the grain. I thought these Rats and  mice were the Elders and official members who  had been in and lain on the church, lived on the  wheat eaten then up instead of building up  New churches. So that when the Twelve  came along they could not get any thing for  the Nauvoo House, or Hardly a place  to stay the rats had eat up the wheat so and we  had to go to the world for a home to stay while  we were their, we are not Polished stones like  Elder Blakesley and  Elder Magin andc But we are rough stones out  of the mountain, and when we roll through  the forest and nock the bark off from the trees  it does not hurt us even if we should get a   ENDENTRY cornor nocked off occasionally for the more  the roll about and knock the corners off the better we  are but if we were pollished and smooth when  we get the cornors knkocked off it would deface  us. This is the case with Joseph Smith he  never professed to be a dressed smooth polished  stone but was rough out of the mountain  and has been rolling among the rocks and trees and  has not hurt him at all but he will be as  smooth and polished in the end as any other  stone, while many that were so vary poliched and smooth in the beginning get badly defaced  and spoiled while theiry are rolling about.   P P Pratt said some are going to Zion the  rest want to know what they shall do. Isaiah  said, I will take one of a city and two of a family  and bring them to Zion and I will feed then with  Pastures after my own heart that will feed  you with knowledge and understanding. And  inasmuch as you harken to council you will  know what the will of the Lord is concerning  you in all things.   O Pratt arose and said I do not know that  I can say any thing to impress the subject upon  your minds that has been spoken upon more  fully than has been done. There are some things  howevere I wish to mention; we have learned  from what we hear this day about the blessings  that will be given when the Temple is finished I will speak of some of the consequences that  will follow if we do not obey. The Lord has  said he will reveal things that have been hid from  the foundation of the world.   ENDENTRY No former age or generation of the world has  had the same things revealed. But the Lord  says if you build that house in that time you  shall be blessed, if not you shall be rejected as  a Church with your dead saith the Lord, so  if that house is not built, then in vain is all  our cares, faith and works our meetings and hopes  are veign. But if few do their duty they  will get the Blessing, and we are determined to  do our duty and set these principles before the  Saints we will turn this responsibility upon  the heads of the Saints and clear our garments  and then the Lord is able to endow all the  faithful in some other place. The Lord  gave a revelation several years since and said  gather together your wise men and send up your  moneys and buy lands if not you shall not have  an inheritance but your enemies are upon  you. We went through and told the Saints thes things but did the Churches do as god comm- anded, No they did not and the Revelation was  fulfilled and the Saints driven out. The Lord  says the Church shall give heed to the  words of the Prophet as he is to hold the keys  of the kingdom of God in this life and the world  to come then it is of much consequence that  you give heed to his word, you can ask God if  the work is true and he will give you a testimony I doubt in my own mind if any man can stand  what they will have to pass through unless they  do get a witness for themselves, and I pray  you to give heed to the words the Twelve have  taught you and ask God to help you   The Conference was Adjourned untill 10 oclock  tomorrow morning   ENDENTRY September 10, 1843 ~ Sunday   Sept 10th 1843 Sunday Morning   Conference met according to adjournment Meeting was opened by singing and Prayer By Elder  Magin after which Elder W. Woodruff arose  and addressed the assembly from Amos 3 ch 7 verse  'Surely the Lord God will do nothing dut but he  revealeth his secrets ^un^to his servents the Prophets'  The speaker Remarked that according to the  Testimony of the scriptures in all ages of the world  whenever God was abot to Bring a Judgment upon  the world or accomplish any great work, the first  thing the Lord has done has been to raise up a Prophet  and reveal unto him his secrets and send him to warn the  people, that they may be left without excuse. This  was the case in the days of Noah and Lot. God was  about to bring Judgments upon the People and he raised  up Prophet and warned them of it but they did not  give heed to them But rejected their Testimony  and the Judgments came upon them and they were  destroyed, while the Prophets were saved by persui- ng the course marked out by the Lord, Jesus Christ  Testifyed to the Jews of the things that awaited  them as a nation the fall of Jerrusalem and their  dispersion among the gentile world but they did  not believe it yet the secret of all these things  was revealed to the Prophet and Apostles and they  believed it and looked for its fulfillment, and it  came to Pass as it was predicted, though conterary  to the expectations of the Jewish Nations. In like  manner do we look for the certain fulfillment of  those tremendous events upon the heads of the  gentile world, which have been spoken of and pointed  out by all the Holy Prophets and apostles since the world  began who have spoken as they were moved upon  by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost   ENDENTRY events which more deeply consern the gentile  world than the overthrow of Jerrusalem and the disper- sion of the Jews did the Jewish Nation, for  while they stumbled at the stone they were broken  but while it falls upon the heads of the gentile  world it will grind them to powder. And the full  set time is come for the Lord to set his hand to  accomplish thies mighty events. And as the Lord  has done in other ages, so he has done now he has  raised up a Prophet and ^is^ revealing unto him his secrets  and through that Prophet He has brought to light the  fullness of the everlasting gospel to the present  generation, and is again once more for the last time  esstablishing his church upon the foundation of  the Ancient Apostles and Prophets Christ Jesus  Being the chief corner stone. In the church is  now found Judges as at the first and councillors as  at the beginning. The church is composed of Apostles  and Prophets, Pasters and Teachers, gifts and graces for  the perfecting of the saints the work of the  ministry and the edifying of the body of Christ The Lord has raised up servents and sent into the  vineyard to prune the vineyard once more for  the last time, to Preach the gospel of Jesus Christ  to warn the Nations that they may be left without  excuse in the day of their visitation and to gather the  honest in heart and the meek of the earth that Zion  may be built up and the Prophets fulfilled; one of  the secrets that God has revealed unto his Prophet  in these days is the Book of Mormon, and it was a  secret to the whole world untill it was revealed  unto Joseph Smith, home whom God has raised up as a  Prophet Seer and Revelator unto his people. This  record contains an account of the ancient inhabita nts of this continant who over spread this land with  cities from sea to sea, the ruins of which still remain   ENDENTRY as a standing monument of their arts, science  power and greatness. it also points out the essta- blishing of this ow our own Nation and also its progress  decline, and fall, and those predictions contained in  the Book of Mormon, the stick of Joseph in  the hands of Ephraim will as truly be fulfilled  as those contained in the Bible the stick and record  of Judah, and Both of these records contained  Prophesys of Great import, concerning the  gentile nations and esspecially this land and nation which  are not yet fulfilled, but must shortly come  to pass, yea its fulfillments is nigh even at the door Though the secretts which God is revealing  through his servant the prophet ##Amos 3:7## in the last days, may  be unpopular and unbelieved by the world  yet their unbelief will not make the truth  of God without effet any more than it did  in the days of Noah or in the fall of Jer- rusalem. When Jesus Christ said their should  not be left one stone upon another in the Temple  that should not be throw^n^ down The Jewsish  nation did not believe it neither would they  receive such testimony but they were ready  to look at outward circumstances, and ready to say  who can prevail against us what nation like  onto our nation, we have held the giving of the  Law the articles, the Urim and Thumim, the  Lawgiver has never departed from between  our feet. We have held the power of government  from generation to generation and what nation now  hath power to prevail against us, and through this  ordor of reasoning they were Blinded and knew not  the day of their visitation they understood not  the things that belonged to their peace. They  rejected their Lord and king, contended against   ENDENTRY his word and Testimony and finally put him to death  on the cross with many who followed him. But  this did not hender the fulfillment of the words  of Jesus Christ concerning that nation, the words of  the Lord had gone out of his mouth and could not  return unto him void, the things that belonged to  their Peace were hid from their ^eyes^. they were count ed unworthy as a nation. The kingdom was to be rent  out of their hands and given to annother, the die was  Cast and Judgment must come. The city was soon  surrounded by the roman army led on by the  inspired Titus, and a scene of calamity judgment and woe  immediately overspread the inhaditants of that city  which was devoted to destruction, such a calamity  as never before had rested upon the nation of Israel Blood flowed through their streets tens of thousands  fell by the edge of the sword, and thousands by famine women were evil towards the children of their  own bosom in the straitness of the seige the seen- ery of which shocked the roman soldiers as they  entered the city. The Jews were crucified in  such numbers by their enemies, that they could find  no more wood for crosses or room for their bodies  in their midst, and while dispair was in evry face  and evry heart sinking, while suffering under the  chastning hand of God their enemies rushed upon  them in the city to strike the last fatal blow and as  their last resort they rushed in to the Temple for  safety which was soon on fire and they sunk in the  midst of the flames with the cry of their suffering, assending on high accompanied by the smoke of her  crackling spires and the remaining miserable few were  sold as slaves and driven like the dumb ass before his  burthen and scattered as corn is sifted in a sive through- out the gentile nations world. Jerrusalem was raised  from its foundations and the Temple thrown down  and the foundation thereof plowed up that not   ENDENTRY one stone was left upon another and Christ said that  Jerrusalem should be trodden down of the gentiles  untill the times of the gentiles be fulfilled which  has been the case to the vary letter untill the present  generation. ##Luke 21:24## Will not God in like manner as truly  and faithfully bring to pass those great, important and  tremendious events upon the heads of the gentile  world which have been proclaimed by the Prophets  Daniel, and many of the Holy  Prophets and Christ and the Apostles, on the continant of  Asia as well as th Moroni and  others who wrote on the continant of America  all of which have proclaimed these things as they  were moved upon by the spirit of Inspiration the  power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost. The  Apostle says that no prophecy of the scriptures is of  any privat interpetation, but commandments  came not of old time by the will of man but  Holy men of God spake as they were moved upon  by the Holy Ghost. Isaiah soul seemed to be on  fire and his mind wraped in the visions of the Almighty  while he declaired in the name of the Lord, that it  should come to pass in the last days that God should  set his hand again the second time to recover the  remnant of his people, assemble the outcast of Israel  gather together the dispersed of Judah, make men  go over dry shod, gather them to Jerrusalem on  horses mules swift beasts and in charriost to rebuild  Jerrusalem upon her own heaps, ##Isaiah 11:11-15## while at the same  time the destroyer of the gentiles was on his way  and while God was turning the captivity of Israel, he  would put all their curses and aflictions upon the  heads of the gentiles their enemies, who had not  saught to recover them but to destroy them and  had troden them under foot from generation to  generation, at the same time the standard should  be lifted up that the honest in heart and the meek  among the gentiles should seek unto it and that   ENDENTRY Zion should be redeemed and be built up a  Holy City, that the glory and power of God shou ld rest upon her, and be seen upon her that  the watchman upon mount Ephraim might cry  arise ye and let us go up unto zion the city of the Lord  our God, that the gentiles might come to her light  and kings to the brightness of her rising. That the  Saints of God may have a place to flee to and stand in  Holy places while judgment works in the earth that when the sword of God that is bathed in heav- en falls upon Idumie or the world when the Lord  pleads with all flesh by sword and by fire and the slain  of the Lord is many that the saints may escape these  calamities by fleeing to the places of refuge like Lot  and 24 ch## gives sumthing of an  account of the calamity and Judgments that shall come  upon the heads of the gentile nations, and this because  they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances  and broken the everlasting covenant. St Paul says  to his Roman Brethren that if the gentiles do not  continue in the goodness of God they like the house  of Israel should be cut off. ##Romans 11:20-22## Though Babylon says I  sit as a queen am no widow and shall see no sorrow  The Revelator says. Therefore shall her plagues come  in one day death and mourning and famine and she  shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is  the Lord God who Judgeth her. ##Revelation 18:7-8## Jesus Presents  a parable of the Fig tree that when we see the signs  in the sun, moon moon stars, heavens and earth of  which he spoke we might know that his coming  is near that the generation in which those signs  appeared should not pass away untill all should be  fulfilled. Though Heaven and earth should pass away  his words should not pass away but should all be  fulfilled ##Luke 21:7-33##   ENDENTRY Those things are about to come to pass upon  the heads of the present generation notwithsta- nding they are not looking for it neither do they  believe it yet their unbelief will not make the  truth of God without effect, the signs are  appearing in the heavens and on the earth and  all things indicate the fulfillment of th Prophets the figtree is leaving summer is nigh. And the Lord  has sent his angels to lay the foundation of this  great and important work, then why should not  God reveal his secrets unto his servents the  Prophets ##Amos 3:7## that the Saints might be led in  paths of safety that they may escape those  evils that are about to engulf a whole genera- tion in ruin   ENDENTRY September 12, 1843 ~ Tuesday   Sept 12th I left Boston at 5 oclock in the  express train of cars for Portland and about  10 oclock while passing through the Chesterwoods  6 miles south of Kennebunk the engine was  thrown from the track in consequence of a rail  being raised 8 inches by some designing miscrant The force was such that It drove the engine  about 5 rods ahead and smashed it to peaces  with the Baggage cars piled top of it and the first passengers cars followed in their ^its^ train and mounted the  pile and instantly killed ^about 8 feet high throwing the passenge 2 illegible words^. One Lady was brused but  not dangerous, another was slightly injured. The  lives of many were in danger, and it seemed a mystery  that so little injury comparatively was done. Four  cars were filled with passengers and had not the  force been broaken by the baggage cars many  lives would have been lost. The Baggage car  soon was on fire which was with difficulty  extinguished. The ruins had The fireman  was thrown about 3 rods and escaped with a slight  injury. But the engineer Mr Adams from  Portland was buried beneath the pile and instantly  Killed, the ruins had to be removed before the  body of the enigneer could be obtained he has left  a wife and one child to mourn his loss. No blame  could possibly be attached to him as the rail was  raised in such a manner that no warning was  given untill the engine and Baggage car was a pile of  ruins. Mr Thomas Hall opened his house for the  reception of the passengers and much praise is due to  the whol household for the attention that was paid  them. I spent most of the night here in the woods  and got chilled through, they sent to Portland  for another engine, which arived in time to  take us to portland in the morning on my arrival   ENDENTRY September 13, 1843 ~ Tuesday   13 I furnished the Editor of the American with  an account of the accident.

I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep and took breakfast   ENDENTRY with father Alley was rather low in her mind but I endeavoured to comfortr her in the gospel. We took a farewell of them and walked to Charleston we here visited the Bunkerhill Monument and walked upon the entrenchment that was flung up by our brave fathers during the night before that memorable battle that was fought upon Bunker Hill but the roar of cannon and clash of arms had long since ceased and the green turf was now trod in safety and the sound from the populous city of Boston was now echoing through the air while our fathers sleep in peace. We had a view of the navy yard as we passed along from thence we entered the city of Boston being the first day my eyes ever beheld its welth or my foosteps ever trod its streets I spent several hours in visiting this city which contained a pop of about 100,000 inhabitants and also as near beatiful and well furnished market probably as any in America. We visited the statehouse which was splendid. I walked to the Cupalo and had a fair view of the whole city. I walked around the commons which was enclosed with an Iron railing of about 2 1/2 miles in length I visited the Tremont House the most noted public house in the city, and also the shiping.

I next walked over the long bridge to Cambridge from thence to Cambridge point I went to the goal in order to have an interview and to comfort Elder Albert P. Rockwood who had been cast into prison by his enemies for debts in order to trouble and distress him, when I arived at the prison the Jailor permitted me to enter into the room whare he was and it was truly a happy meeting for althoug we were strangers after the flesh yet we were united in the spirit. This was the first time I ever entered into a prison to see an Elder of Israel but after the keeper of the prison doors had turned the key upon us and left us together to comfort each other in the midst of Iron grates and bars I began to inquire into the state of his mind and it gladdened my soul to find him strong in the GOD of Abram Daniel and Eligah he was rejoicing in God contented in his mind and strong in the faith once deliverd to the saints Brother Rockwood had the Bible, Book of Mormon, P. P. Pratts voice of warning, and the Evening and Morning star as his companions   ENDENTRY which he constantly read. We conversed together about three hours in this solitary abode and our souls were made glad. He informed me of many things that had transpired while he was there in gaol and among the variety he made mention of the goal taking fire a few days previous to my visiting him, he said this looked sumthing like a dark hour the fire was roaring over his head while a scene of uproar confusion and distress was upon every hand engines were rapidly playing around the building—water pouring into every room the people hallowing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy to be streets let out lest they be consumed in the fire one of the number was strugling in the agonies of death while others were cursing and swearing andc Br Rockwood said he felt composed through the confused scenery untill the fire was extin- guished and silence once more was known in the gaol. Elder Rockwood was writing his life while in this state of confinement he sent a roll of the same by me to his Holliston, at half past 8 oclock P.M. the Jailor came and unlocked the prison doors and I took the parting hand with this worthy Brother while he manifested much Joy for my visit. Well whose soul would not be cheered to have a friend visit them while cast into prison. I left him in good spirits and bent my way back again to the city of Boston while crossing the long bridge on my return I herd the cry of fire, the ringing of Bells, the ratling of the engines, I soon beheld the flames begin to illuminate the city it was however extinguished in half an hour by the flood of water that was poured in upon the fire from the engines. I then crossed into the city and being alone and a stranger and in the darkness of the night I lost my way in the midst of the city, but after wandering a wile I called into Myrtle street No 9 and I there found Elder Ball with a company of saints in a room occupied by Sister Vose all were patiently waiting for me, it was a happy meeting. Notwithstanding it was late in the evening I spent a season in teaching them the things of God I then left these sisters who are patient in tribulation and wal- ked with Elder Ball into Butoph street No 12 whare Elder Ball resides with his Mother we here spent the night which ended this day of variety FIGURES Distance of the day 25 miles   ENDENTRY May 12, 1838 ~ Saturday   May 12th   I spent the fore part of the day in visiting different parts of the city I saw many curiosities and vanities from different parts of the world......

I spent a short time in the morning in visiting the Roman Catholic Church they were attending their morning meeting when I entered the house. After visiting the house and beholding their Priest Images and mockery and see them use their Holy water I left the house disgusted with their religion. I met with Elder Vose's room to convers upon the things of the Kingdom. We again met with them also a small congregation of citizens at the same place at 3 oclock PM. and I spoke unto them from Peter 1 ch 20, 21. the saints appeared edefyed and the minds of some enquiring a certain physician by the name of Salmon S Wilder manifested great firmness in the cause.

We again met the saints in the evening and had an interesting time in speaking of the goodness of God and breaking bread unto the saints the spirit of God rested upon us and our souls were edefyed and the sisters manifested their faith and strength in the work of God in which they were enjaged and notwithstanding some had taken great advantage of their liberality yet they had not lost confidence in God or his servants and their charity was manifested towards us we took the parting hand with these saints of God and again spent the night with Brother Balls friends 3 miles   ENDENTRY May 14, 1838 ~ Monday   May 14th We left the city of Framingham from thence to Deacon Holliston and spent the night beneath his roof in company with several of the saints.

When we arived at Deacon Haven's I had the privilege of reading LaRoy Sunderland pieces in the Zions Watchman against the Book of Mormon and Parley's voice of warning I never was more edefied in reading a pamphlet than on this occasion he does justice in exposing the lies of Mr Sunderland and also utters an important prophecy upon the head of Mr Sunderland and also against the paper styled Zions Watchman distance of the day 30 miles    ENDENTRY May 15, 1838 ~ Tuesday   15 We walked from Brother Newel Nurs and Preached at night at his house we enjoyed ourselves well with the saints distance 6 miles    ENDENTRY May 16, 1838 ~ Wednesday   16 Walked to Br Palmer's and preached at night at his house the spirit of God rested upon me and we had a good time after meeting we walked to Elder Nurs and spent the night distance of the day 10 m    ENDENTRY May 17, 1838 ~ Thursday   17 Took the parting hand with the houshold of Elder Wrentham, to Rhodeisland this the sixteenth state I have visited in my peregrinations FIGURE Sixteen States.

We next visited Brother Parker in King Street No 327. we then returned to Br Fosters in Hamersly Street No 26. I accompanied Brother and Sister Foster in the evening to market and it was a peculiar scene to me. It put me in mind of the merchandize of Babylon that the Revelator John spoke of.

Brother Everett about a year since had an  interview with forty Lamanite chiefs in this city while on their return from Washington to their  homes. When he first entered the room whare they were sitting they grasped his hand in friendship as  though they were inspired to know who he was. Brother Everett gave them an account of the Book  of Mormon and informed them that the fulness of the gospel would soon go to them they apparently  receieved the intelligence with the greatest degree of interest. he told them to receive it and teach their  tribes to do so when it come unto them; the chiefs promised to do so and wished him to come among  them and teach them these things. we arived at the place of meeting which closed this interesting su- bject.
