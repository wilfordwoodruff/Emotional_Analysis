Brother Joseph your views are correct upon this principle the  God of Heaven will sustain these men who honor, obey and preach  the Celestial Law of God, although we may be called to pass through  trials, afflictions, & persecution, yet the God of Heaven will chose  that class of Men As rulers in his Kingdom throughout all  Eternity And the God of Israel will show this Nation before  he gets through with them, that his Law is supreme and shall be  obeyed, and all men who fight against him, his Laws, or his people  will be broaken to peaces, and brought down to the dust by the power of  God and No power can stay his hand. I have no fears nor trembling  concerning the Church, Zion or Kingdom of God in far as the righteous are   concerned. They will rise triumphant and come off victorious God  reigns our Nation must get fully ripe and No field of wheat

 6  Ever ripened faster. Judgment & affliction must begin at the House  of God But wo unto those who fight against Zion & the Saints of God  A generation of vipers shall not escape the Damnation of Hell. The   Eye of God sees them, and knows all their works, and has in reserve  a swift Judgment for them all for there is a time appointed to reward  Every man according to their works. And when Boggs Ford Merry,   Edmunds, Zane, Powers Dixen Logan and the whole   armey of Devils in human shape get into the spirit world   and have time to rest themselves, and look around they will have  a vary different opinion of Mormonism than what that they  have in this world. Brother Spight I have never felt   better in my life than I have during these Last 2 years  that I have been in Exile, as far as my faith & spirits are   concerned I know God reigns & is at the helm, and our Enemies  will go no further than God permits. Although the Devil is ruling  over his kingdom he is not the president of this world, but He  is limited by that power who hold the destiny of all devils  Man & Nation in his own hands Zion needs clensing and  weeding we would hardly have looked for such [rascols] as  Carrington Thomas Taylor John Q Cannon and others, when  Zion is clensed it will be healthier.

It has taken the wind out of the  sails of all who expected to get rich out of a  fight with the Mormons, and it is anticipated  that the judges will soon leave, and that we  shall have peace again for a while.    We have had a cold winter and  spring. There has fallen more snow on the  mountains than we have had any winter for  many years. All our streams are overflowing  their banks. Many army followers are about  leaving for California, Oregon, Pike's Peak, and  the States. We have a good prospect of a large crop  of fruit of all kinds grown in this territory. We  are putting in a good deal of sugar cane in this  territory. I have sent to Cincinnati for a sugar  mill, as have several others. We are all well and  doing well.

I have kept a Daily Journal for twenty  five years & I have Recorded in my Journal mostany off the sermons & teachings  that I have heard Joseph Smith the prophet & Brigham Young and it has been a  gift bestowed upon me that I could hear half a dozen sermons Delivered in  succession & go to my office & sit down next day and write most of them sentence by  sentence as they were Delivered and it is in consequence of this gift that I have been Employ as  the assistant Historian of the Church I have a great anxiety to preserve the History of the  church & kingdom of God esstablished upon the Earth in the last dispensation and  fulness of times for it is destined to become a mountain & fill the whole Earth  as Daniel saw it, and those things which have been prophesied of by Joseph  Smith 30 years ago are now being fulfilled day by Day.

 to be remembered to you and family, to father Carter,  Shuah, and all their acquaintances.    I have received several copies of the "Portland  Argus" of late, for which I beg to return you my thanks.  I frequently send you the "Deseret News," though I  do not know whether you can get it them  or not. I sent father Carter six in one pack-  age last fall, containing a printed copy of a sy-  nopsis of my history. I would like to know  if he obtained them. Remember me kindly  to him. Sister Foss and family are all   well. She got a letter a short time since  from Ezra. She sends her respects to you,  and says she will write soon. You ask if Miss  Gold is in this Valley. She is in this city and  well. I see it named in the "Argus" that  William Kimball and Joseph A. Young have  apostatized and gone to the states. This is  not true, neither is it true that Brigham  Young deposited any money in the bank  at Washington, through his agent, J. M. Bern-  hisel. Mr. Bernhisel deposited money on  his own account, although President Young  advised him tnot to do so, in consequence  of the insecurity of the banks.

 LOGAN, the County Seat of Cache County, Utah, is located 65 miles north of Ogden, in the centre of the Cache Valley. To describe its wonder-  ful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied sce-  nery, or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is 60 miles in length from north to south, and 12 miles in width, containing nearly  one-half million acres of land that will grow all the products of the temperate zone, and of such productiveness that five acres intelligently handled will  yield more than an ordinary farm in the Eastern or Middle States. Logan is the commercial and agricultural centre of this magnificent valley, and is  completely surrounded by the Wasatch range of mountatins, the altitude of the valley being 4502 feet above the Pacific ocean. The waters of the Logan  and Blacksmith fork rivers are capable of furnishing the finest water power in the west, and are filled with trout and other fish The writer will here  say that for investors seeking where unlimited facilities afford themselves, Logan is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be de-  sired, a short, mild winter and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size  or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Logan has a population of over 6000. Onyx and all  the precious metals are all around here, and for investment of money this County cannot be excelleed. Logan has one railroad, a branch from Cache  Junction on the U. N. R. R., extending 42 miles in length. Logan is the educational center of Utah—the Agricultural College, capable of accommodating  1000 students, where all art and science is taught. The Brigham Young and New Jersey Colleges, all creditable institutions and worth of patronage.  The writer will mention that all lines of business are represented here, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops,  and foundries, all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for  beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be enjoyed without a single drawback, we say  come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of this will recieve a prompt reply.    Union Meat Market,    Logan, Utah, Sept 21 1894    J. C. KNOWLES, Proprietor.

 Oct. 11th, [1889]  To James G. Bleak  St. George.    Dear Brother:    I enclose a letter to you from Sister Bleak, and in reply to   her letter I want to say to you that President Taylor made an appropriation to  [smudged ink] in St. George, of $100, and I think you had charge at the time of   [smudged ink] office. You paid me $100 in gold on that account. Now I want to  [smudged ink] if I borrowed $100 of you on your own account. If so, did I give a note for   [smudged ink] I have no recollection in the world of borrowing $100 of you, outside   of the $100 appropriated by President Taylor. Now, if I did borrow the $100 of   [smudged ink] Sister Bleak spoken of, I certainly want to pay it. It seems strange to   [smudged ink] I forget it, for I am generally very particular about borrowing   money. If I borrowed this money of you, besides the appropriation I do not want  [smudged ink] any scruples about it, but if I did, tell me so and I will pay you  if I borrowed the money, I would like the day and date, and also say if I have a   note. I would pay it just as quick without a note as with. I would like her letter  [smudged ink] to me, with a correct knowledge of the matter.

I am much gratified with your kind expressions towards me, in memory of  my 82nd birthday anniversary and the many pleasant and agreeable personal asso-  ciations of the past. I appreciate the warm feelings of friendship you express on  your own behalf and on that of your family, Brother and Sister Cottam, Brothers  Samuel & Jos. Hardy, their wives, and also Brothers Pymm, Randall, McArthur and  Atkin, and all my friends and the saints in the sunny and sandy south; and I  reciprocate their love and friendship and from my heart I bless them and pray God  my heavenly Father to pour out upon the in rich abundance every blessing, both  temporal and spiritual, that they can desire or ask for in righteousness, as a  reward for their integrity and faithfulness to the cause of Zion.    I should be greatly pleased to have an opportunity of visiting the saints  in the south again with the liberty I now have, according to my strength, of

As to my being able  to attend the next conference at Manti I cannot now  say whether I can attend or not. If I can do so  I will inform you in time by telegraph so that  you can be prepared to be there.    I am very glad you are enjoying yourself as  well on your Mission.

 under Heavens unto Jerrusalem they will Rebuild their city & temple in  unbelief & the gentiles Nations will go up to battle aganst them. when  that great destruction will take place in the valley of Jehoshaphat as spoken of  by Ezekiel. The Latter Day Saints will build up Zion. The Ten tTribes of  Israel will be Revealed & come forth from the North country into the land  of Zion & Recieve their Endowments & be crowned under the hands of the children  of Ephraim the servants of God, & Zion will be built up in beauty power  & glory & the Saints have got to become purified & prepared as a Bride adorned  for her Husband and the wicked Nations will be destroyed by wars & the Judgments of  God. And Christ will descend in the clouds of Heaven & all the Saints who are alive  will be changed & caught up to meet him & the Saints who are in ther graves will  come forth out of ther graves, & will be caught up to meet the Lord then after the  wicked are Destroyed the Lord will Descend to the Earth to reign with his  Saints one thousand years this is what is called the Millennium Now  these things will take place in this generation. there are many now standing  in this generation who will live to see the coming of the Mesiah & one reason  why the Christ will overtake the world like a thief in the night is that the  world do not believe in the litteral fulfillment of the scripture while the fact  is all the prophesies will be litterally fulfilled. You can see from this that there  must be a great Deal done in a little time but we will find that the  Lord will make a short work upon the Earth in the Latter day & you may  look out for sights, signs & wonders from this time Henceforth untill the com-  ing of Christ Now I Realize that to talk these things to the

 53    Respectfully  You Brother.  W Woodruff[end of sideways text]    Dec. 13, 1890    My Dear Bertha Woodruff:    [Half of text is warped by water]   I have just received your letter of the 15th, and in reply  will say, I am very sorry for you, and am sorry that I am not in a situation today  to help you. Ensign called upon me today and wanted me to loan him $100. I am  heavily in debt myself, and I have not a dollar to use only what I borrow. I was  notified yesterday that I must connect the Valley House with the sewer within 10  days or be fined. I do not know how much it will cost but it will be a heavy bit  I have looked for this trouble that has now overtaken both Marion and Ensign in  consquence of their refusing to obey my counsel. I got them both work on the   Street cars at $60 a month cash, but they foolishly joined the stikers, joined  the Union and our enemies and after this I went to the Superintendent of the com  pany and got him to agree to take both of them back, and I went to them twice and  urged them to return to work, but they would not do it. Now they are out of em-  ployment and find it necessary to borrow means to live upon. I am sorry for their  wives and children; but as long as they will not take my counsel I do not feel th[at]  I am responsible to my family. I have done all I could for them, and they would  be all right today if they had hearkened to my advice. Marion did wrong in buy  ing so expensive a barn. He could have built his house and been out of debt; but  neither xxxxxx Marion nor Ensign seek my counsel until they get into trouble, and  they then come to me for money. If there is any way opens whereby I can get $50,  I will let you have in if I get it. Marion and Ensign both ought to go back to t[he]  Railroad company to work. I felt sorry to think they refused me twice after I g[ot]  them the chance to go back; but this is all I need to say to you now. I am sorry  that good women and children are made to suffer by the unwise course of their hus  bands. I pray God to bless you and open the door for you to get the necessaries  of life. As ever, Yours,    W Woodruff 
 2  attending to all the duties of my calling openly and freely. But I am not as young  as I was ten, twenty or thirty years ago, and I find that the cares and labors of  the Priesthood have not diminished but increased upon me. The Kingdom grows and   responsibilities increase, notwithstanding the efforts of the wicked one and  all his agencies on earth to prevent it; and although my desire is strong to  visit, counsel and exhort the saints, as in years gone by, the duties of my  position and the increased labors which have fallen upon me seem to make it  necessary for me to shift a large portion of this labor, for the present and fu-  ture, upon those who are younger and stronger than I am.    In my visit through Utah County recently I attended twelve meetings,  speaking at all of them, and enjoying much of the good spirit. But I contracted   a severe cold which forced me to desist and return home, and from which I am  still suffering. I hope, however, soon to be fully recovered from it. Having  been so long measurably confined to limited quarters, and so little accustomed to  public exercises, Brother Cannon and I felt, perhaps, too much like boys when  we started out and, so far as I am concerned at least, may have overdone a little.  Brother Cannon enjoys his restored liberty exceedingly, although it is far from  being complete. I trust the Lord will soon remove the yoke of the enemy, so that  our liberty, and that of our families also, may be perfect. We are in the hands of  God. He has preserved us thus far and developed His purposes in His own way and

I think  it exceedingly unwise for you to  return here at present, for reasons   you may learn hereafter.    In reference to those letters, inas-  much as you profess willingness  to obey my counsel, your best plan  will be to send them immediately  to James Jack.

 February 15 [189]2    Mr John W. Clark,  New York City.    Dear Sir:    Your letter of February 2nd 1892 is before me. In  reply will say that about all I can do is to give you the names  of my Father's family.    My Great Grand Fathers name was Josiah. He was over 100   years when he died, in the north part of Farmington, then called  Northington. I do not know his childrens names.    My Grand Father's name was Eldad. His sons names were   Eldad, Samuel, Titus, Aphek and Ozem. His Daughters, Helen   and Elizabeth.    My Fathers name was Aphek. His three sons by his first   wife, were Azmon, Thompson and Wilford.  He married his  second wife, and had six children, all died young.    While in London in 1840, I traced the Woodruff family   from the London Book of Heraldry; from whom the American   Woodruffs descended. A Woodruff was Lord Mayor of London   in 1666, about the time of the great fire and plague of  London. Two sons of this descendant came to America soon  after the arrival of the "Mayflower," who brought the first

 November 12th 1892.    HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,    Dear Sir:    I received your letter of Nov. 1st several days since,  and I have taken the first opportunity I could to answer. I have had a   great anxiety myself to see the Woodruff history published, but as yet it  has not been done. I spent one month in London in 1840 and several  months in 1846. The Woodruff book of heraldry gives two lineages of the  Woodruffs. One spelled Woodroffe, the other Woodruff; the latter family  we are descended from. In about 1666 on of our progenitors was Lord  Mayor of London, about the time of the great fire and plague. I obtained  the Woodruff Coat of Arms, and impression of which I send you herewith. Two  of our fore-fathers came to America soon after the Mayflower, and settled  in Hartford, and soon afterwards John and Matthew Woodruff came and settled  in Farmington, from whom you and I descended. John settled in Farmington  in 1681 and Matthew in 1716. I cannot trace the family in a direct line  to our day. My great-grandfather's name was Josiah. He lived a little  past 100 years. My grandfather's name was Eldad; his sons were Eldad,  Samuel, Titus, Aphek and Ozem; all born in the north part of Farmington, call  Northingtons, now Avon. Eldad's son lived to about 85 years of age.  Samuel was 92. My father, Apek Woodruff, died in this city 84 years of  age. My mother, Bulah Thompson Woodruff, died in 1808, leaving three sons;  Azmon, Thompson and myself. I was the youngest, being 14 months old.  I   was born March 1st, 1807, making me 85 years, 8 months and 12 days old. My  oldest brother, Azmon, died here 87 years old; my brother Thompson is still  living, is in his 87th year. 
 Salt Lake City,  July 27th, 1892.    Hiram Yeager    Dear Sir:    I have just received your  note refering on affairs to arbit-  ration.

 December 13th. 1892.    HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,    Dear Sir:    I have received your letter of Dec. 2nd. with geneological  history enclosed; and I feel under great obligation to you for them, as I,  like yourself, am deeply interested in the Woodruff genealogy. And I  sign to say, it does not require an apology on your part for making the  corrections you offer concerning what I wrote you, as I very much desire  to have everything pertaining to this matter as correct as it is possible  to get it; and I am satisfied that you are as near correct as a person can  be by searching the records and works at your command. In regard to what   I said concerning the lineage of the two English Woodruffs and the spell-  ing of their names, I acted upon what was before me; but you, doubtless,  have better sources of information that I.    With regard to Matthew and John Woodruff who settled in Hartford and  Farmington, what I wrote you regarding them I took from the History of  Hartford County, by J. Hammond Trumbull; and I should, of course, have men-  tioned the source of my information.    As to the spelling of the Woodruff name in so many different ways,   I do not wonder so much at that, for the reason, as you yourself have  doubtless learned, that it is quite a common thing for a name in the course  of generations to undergo a variety of changes in spelling without in the  least affecting the lineage. As to whether Matthew and John Woodruff  were brothers or not I really do not know myself; I have come to regard  them as such here by way of taking it for granted than from actual gene-  alogical or historical knowledge.

 2. H. L. W.    This account of my own family may be of little or no use to you in  tracing you family; but iy is all that I can do for you in this direction  I think all the American Woodruffs descended from the two brothers, John  and Matthew, who first settled in Hartford.    Should you be in posession of the genealogy of any of the early  Woodruffs which I have not, I would thank you to favor me with it.    Yours Respectfully,    Wilford Woodruff 
 June 29, 1893    Mr. Isaac Gron,  Pleasant Green.    Derar Brother    Your letter of the 28th has just arrived and in reply  will say: As I understand the matter of land there, I homesteaded a  quater section of land, but could not fulfill the law, and it was  turned over to you, and you let me have 30 acres of it. I sold that  30 acres to my son Wilford, and I considered that that ended my con-  nection with the land. I did something about the fencing, but I  do not know how much it was nor what it was. Of course, we ahve  never occupied any of it, but my son, I think, rented someof it to  your cousin. I have talked with Wilford this morning concerning this  letter, and he says you have some feelings about a mule that you let  Flavel Spencer have and you hold Wilford responsible for it in some  way; but this is a matter that I have no knowledge of nor any respon-  siblility in. I have too much on my hands to be troubled with anything  about this land. You will have to settle it with Wilford, and he  ought to do what is right about it. iI suppose he will write to you.  His residence is in the 9th Ward, and Samuel Woolley is his Bishop.    Your Brother,  W. Woodruff 
 I have gathered together the names of all the Woodruffs that I have   been able to obtain, in the hope sometime of being able to [confirm them]  genealogically, at least, sufficiently to encourage my children to success-  fully carry on the work after me. I am not able at present to send you   a copy of these names, but will do so as soon as I can [illegible] may  interest you at least, if not assist you.    Permit me to inquire how much, in your opinion, it would be to pub-  lish in book form the Woodruff genealogy, as far as you can come able to  compile it?    Respectfully,  Wilford Woodruff 
 Dec. 12, 1893.    Prest. Geo. G. Cannon,  Dear Brother:    I write to say that I am calling   some young men to be missionaries to Germany, including three bankers,  A. Owen Woodruff and McEwan, of the State Bank, abd Brother Schettler's   son, and expect to call some others. We understand that Brother Schaerrer  time is out and he epxects to come home and we want someone to preside,  and Brother Joseph says you once named your son Hugh. Now our boys feel  that they would like very much to labor under him if he could go and pre-  side there, and before writing to you I sent for him to come and see me.  I have just had an interview with Hugh; he feels as though he would not   like to go Germany to preside, but if he went he would rather go as a   missionary and some one else to preside, but that is the very kind of a   man that ought to preside and not one who is seeking the office. Now  concerning Hugh, I do not know that he ought to be called to go upon any   mission at present. He has lately returned from a mission there and gone  into business, though I think he is not much involved in debt. I felt to   lay the matter before you and get your counsel upon it, and can you name  any one who would be suitable to preside there. ^if Hugh did not go^ The 20th of January is  the time named to start. I would be glad of an early reply to this.    Now concerning our affiairs east, of course we are interested in   all your labors and accomplishments. We see from the press that there  is a good prospect of the Utah Bill for Admission passing the House,  which we hope may be accomplished; and also through the Senate and become  a law. We hope you and Brother Clawson will prosper upon your mission 
 Aug. 28, 1893.    General James S. Clarkson,  San Francisco.    My dear Sir:    I am in receipt of your favor of the 24th inst.,  and thank you very much for the expression of compliment and   encouragement contained therein. I believe with you, General,  that old-time prejudices against us are fast passing away; and  have pleasure in believing that the day will come when whatever   of merit there may be in us as a community and our labors will  be recognized and appreciated by our fellow-citizens; and in the   meantime we will continue to work for the good of our fellow men   and the building up of the country which kind Providence led us   to and has established us in.    Prests. Cannon and Smith join me in sending you our   kindest regards and best wishes. We are quit[e] busy in view of   our leaving for Chicago to-morrow.    I am,    Yours very truly,  Wilford Woodruff 
 REMARKS  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Tab-  ernacle, Great Salt Lake City, May 19, 1867.     [REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.]    I also am a missionary, and I always  considered it a great honor to be one. I  received a mission when I embraced  this work; it has never been taken from  me yet. In company with a number of  the brethren I have just returned, as   br. Taylor has said, from visiting our  brethren in the south. We have had  an excellent time. We have been over   a great many rough roads, traveled   hard, and have preached from once to   three times every day. We have been   taught, instructed and edified; at least  I have a great deal. We have had a   good time in visiting the Saints, and as  President B. Young remarked in some   of his discourses, we have been able to  draw the contrast between preaching to   the Saints and preaching to the world.   My own experience enabled me to bring  that subject home very readily, and I  presume it is so with most of the Elders  who have been on missions preaching  the gospel. I have travelled a great  many thousands of miles to preach the  gospel without purse or scrip, with my   knapsack on my back and begging my   bread from door to door. I have done  many things that all the gold in Cali-  fornia would not have hired me to do  except for the gospel. My natural feel-  ings would forbid me travelling through  the world asking for my bread from   door to door; I would much sooner labor  for it.    We have been called to preach the   gospel; the Lord Almighty has required  it at our hands; we would have been un-  der condemnation as elders if we had  not done it. We have done it, and our   garments, in a great measure, are  clear of the blood of this genera-  tion. For over thirty years we have  labored to preach the gospel; and we  have gathered together a people to these  valleys of the mountains, with whom I   rejoice to meet. I once asked the Lord   to let me go and preach the gospel. I   had a desire to preach the gospel in its  beauty, plainness and glory, and to  show the worth of the principles it con-  tained. I felt that they were of as much   value to my fellow men as to me. The   Lord gave me the privilege I asked for,   and I believe that I have preached to  the nations of the earth as much as I  desire; if duty should not require it, I   never wish to go and preach to the   world again. I have had my day and  time at it; still, if called to go, I pre-  sume I should go as I have always done.   But I do enjoy the society of the Saints,   I love home, and I love to travel   through these settlements and to see  the boys, the girls, the men, and the   women parading the streets to welcome   the President and his brethren. And  on our return here, to meet with greet-  ings from ten thousand Saints brought   peculiar meditations to my mind. It   brought home very forcibly the con-  trast between preaching to the Saints   and preaching to the world.    In my early missions, when preach-  ing in the Southern States—Arkansas,   Tennessee and Kentucky—I have   waded swamps and rivers and have   walked seventy miles or more without   eating. In those days we counted it a  blessing to go into a place where there   was a Latter-day Saint. I went once   150 miles to see one; and when I got  there he had apostatized and tried to  kill me. Then, after travelling seventy-  two miles without food, I sat down to   eat my meal with a Missouri mobocrat,  and he damning and cursing me all the  time. That is the nature of the South-  ern people, they would invite you to  eat with them if they were going to cut   your throat. In those days we might   travel hundreds and hundreds of miles  and you could not find a Latter-day   Saint; but now, thank God, we have  the privilege of travelling hundreds   and hundreds of miles where we can  find but little else. I regard this as a   great blessing.    Our missionaries are going abroad un-  der different circumstances from what   we went. We had no Zion, no Utah,   no body of Saints to give us any assis-  tance. We were commanded to go   without purse or scrip, and we had to   do it. We trusted in the Lord, and He   fed us. We found friends, built up   churches, and gathered out the honest  and meek of the earth. Times have   changed since then. These brethren  are going to the nations of the earth  where starvation stares many of the  people in the face, and where it is hard   for millions to obtain the necessaries of  life. The people here are wealthy, and it  is no more than right that we should im-  part of our substance to help those who  are going on missions. I hope the  brethren and sisters will help liberally,   and will impart sufficient to send the  brethren to their several fields of labor.    I rejoice in the gospel of Christ; I re-  joice in the principles that have been  revealed for our salvation, exaltation  and glory. I rejoice in the establish-  ment of the work in these mountains;  and in our southern settlements. As   has been already said, the Lord has   blessed our brethren there. It is a   miracle to see those settlements, when   we consider what the country was such   a short time since. The city of St.  George is second to none in the Terri-  tory unless it be Great Salt City;   and I doubt the latter being equal to  St. George when we take into consider-  ation the population of the two places.  They have better buildings and im-  provements there, according to the num-  bers, than we have here. At Tokerville,   too, they are laying fine foundations  for stone and brick buildings, and they  are improving all through the southern   settlements. The soil there is so sandy   that it looks as if it would require two   men to hold it together long enough for  a hill of corn to grow: like the waves   of the sea, it is ever on the move; it con-  tains, too, a good deal of mineral which   destroys the vegetation and everything  with which it comes in contact. Some  of the brethren have spent as much as  two thousand dollars to render an acre   of land productive; now they have fine  gardens and vineyards growing, and  strange to say, though the country, na-  turally looks like a desolate, barren,   sandy, unfruitful desert, still the cattle  are fat, all kinds of stock look well and   everything was green and flourishing  in the settlements as we passed through   them. The whole of that mission at its   commencement presented a most for-  bidding aspect, and really had so many  discouraging features that men were   compelled to work by faith and not by   sight. Now, however, the soil is bless-  ed, the climate is delightful, and plenty   and prosperity attend the labors of the   people. To show you the difference   of the climate in the cotton country,   and of the district of country a few miles  this side of it, I need only mention that   the morning we left Beaver there was  ice along the creeks; but when we got  to Tokerville, two days travel further   south, we found the apricots half grown,  the peaches as large as peas, the cotton-  wood trees green and in full leaf, alto-  gether looking like another country. It   is a different climate altogether from   what it is in these higher places.    The hand of God is in all the opera-  tions we are trying to carry out. We   have to build up Zion independent of   the wicked; we have got to become self-  sustaining, and the Lord is inspiring  His prophets to preach to us to lay the  foundation for the accomplishment of  this work. The day is not far distant   when we shall have to take care of our-  selves. Great Babylon is going to fall;  judgment is coming on the wicked; the   Lord is about to pour upon the nations   of the earth the great calamities which   He has spoken of by the mouths of His   prophets; and no power can stay these  things. It is wisdom that we should  lay the foundation to provide for our-  selves.    With regard to the Word of Wisdom  I must say I was agreeably surprised to   see how generally the people are taking   hold of it. We did not see much coffee,  nor tea; and I do not think that one in  the company drank a drop of it. I re-  joice in this: it is going to make the peo-  ple more wealthy; it will save us a great  deal of means, besides preventing our  being poisoned to death, for these   things are poisoned, and the Lord un-  derstood that when He gave the Word   of Wisdom many years ago. The peo-  ple are improving in a great many  things. There is a very good spirit and   feeling among them; and the feeling to   carry out the purposes of God is gen-  eral.    I rejoice in this work because it is   true, because it is the plan of salvation,   the eternal law of God that has been re-  vealed to us; and the building up of   Zion is what we are called to perform.   I think we have done very well consid-  ering our traditions and all the difficul-  ties which we have had to encounter;   and I look forward, by faith, if I live a  few years, to the time when this peo-  ple will accomplish that which the Lord  expects them to do. If we do not, our   children will. Zion has got to be built  up, the Kingdom of God has got to be  established, and the principles revealed  to us have to be enjoyed by the Latter-  day Saints. There is no principle that   God has revealed but what has salva-  tion in it, and we, in order to be saved,   must observe His laws and ordinances.  Where is there a man or woman who   does not wish to be saved? All wish to   be saved; all desire salvation and to  enjoy those blessings which they   were created to enjoy. The gospel has   been offered to this generation for the   purpose of saving them in the Kingdom  of God if they will receive it. I rejoice  in all the principles revealed to us, and  the more I see, hear and learn, the   more I am satisfied of the importance of   the revelations that God has given to us.   As President Young remarked in one of   his sermons south, "Whatever the Lord   reveals to this or any other people, does  not ignore anything revealed before."   No part of the gospel is superfluous. It  is the same yesterday, to-day and for   ever; and all the inhabitants of this world   and all others, have got to be saved by  it, if saved at all. It is necessary, there-  fore, that we receive and obey all of its   principles. When the first principles   of the gospel were revealed to us we re-  joiced in them. After them we had  other principles revealed, the principle   of baptism for the dead for instance.   We did not know anything of that un-  til about the year 1840, on our return  from England. I rejoice in that princi-  ple. It is a great blessing that there   can be saviors on Mount Zion. It is a   glorious principle that we can go forth  and erect temples and attend to ordi-  nances for the living and the dead; that  we can redeem our forefathers and pro-  genitors from among the spirits in pri-  son. They will be preached to in   prison by those spirits on the other side   of the vail who hold the keys of the  Kingdom of God; and we will have   the privilege of attendidg to ordinances in   the flesh for them. Then, again, the   blessing of that God has revealed to us in  the patriarchal order of marriage—be-  ing sealed for time and eternity—is not  prized by us as it should be. When   that principle was revealed, the Pro-  phet told the brethren that this king-  dom could not advance any further  without it; "and," said he, "if you do  not receive it you will be damned saith   the Lord." You may think this very   strange, but the Lord never reveals   anything that He does not require to be  honored.    What would have been our position   if this had not been revealed? This  principle is plain, clear and interesting;  without it not a man in this Church   could have either wife or child   sealed to him for eternity. For all our  marriage covenants before were only  for time; and we as a Church had ar-  rived at that point, when in order to en-  sure a full salvation it was necessary to   reveal this principle. It is a great bless-  ing to us. We love our wives and   children, and wish to enjoy their soci-  ety; but the thought of separation   would mar all the happiness that the   Saints might otherwise attain. The  Saint who aspires to salvation and glo-  ry wants a continuation of family ties   and associations after death. Without  this principle we were like the rest of   the world,—without any such hope.   From the day those apostles were slain  until the Lord revealed this principle   in the last days, not a man ever dwelt  in the flesh who had wife or child sealed  to him for eternity, so that he could en-  joy their society in the resurrection.   That was just our position before this  ordinance was revealed; but now,   whether we have one wife, two, three  or as many as the Lord sees fit to bestow   upon us, when we come forth from the   grave our families remain with us in   the eternal world. So it is with every   principle that the Lord reveals—it is good   for His people in time and eternity.    Brethren and sisters, let us be faith-  ful, and look at the promises of God as   they are contained in the gospel of   Christ, and never treat lightly any prin-  ciple, no matter what it is; whether it   be faith, repentance, baptism for the re-  mission of sins, the resurrection of the   dead, eternal judgments, the marriage  covenant, baptism for the dead, or any  other ordinance that the Lord has revealed;   they all belong to the kingdom, are   necessary to salvation, and the responsi-  bility of carrying them out rests upon   this people. We know that the world   looks with contempt upon us and upon   the institutions of the kingdom of God.   They do not object to institutions that   are corrupt and ungodly. The world is  flooded to-day, with evil and wicked-  ness, and the earth groans under it.   But because we as a people follow the   example of Abraham, in taking more  wives than one, we are universally de-  cried and despised. The Christian   world profess to believe in Abraham,   and he through obedience to the com-  mand of God in this respect, was called  the "Father of the faithful;" and the  twelve gates of the New Jerusalem will  each be named after one of the twelve   patriarchs, his descendants, and the sons   of a polygamist, and fathers of all Israel.   Even the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of   God, who came to lay down his life to   redeem the world, was through the   same lineage. He was of Judah; He   was the King of the Jews and the Sa-  vior of the world.    These principles are as righteous to-  day as in any other age of the world,  when governed and controlled by the   commandments of God. Let us prize  all the principles, revelations and bless-  ings that God has revealed to us; let us   treasure them up, do our duty to God,   to one another and our fellow men. No   man has any time to sin, to steal, swear  or break any of the laws of God, if he  wishes to secure a full and complete   salvation; but we must all do the best   we can, laboring with all our might to   overcome every evil, for it will take a   whole life of faithfulness and integrity,  for any Saint of God to receive a full   salvation in the presence of God.    May God bless us, and give us His   spirit and wisdom to guide and direct  us into all truth; for Jesus' sake.   Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said he regarded our experience  in the Church as a more valuable schooling than any people had  ever enjoyed. The Saints did not realize their priveleges nor avail  themselves of the blessings they might enjoy. No one who held any  office in the Priesthood should feel that their offices were unimportant.  He related instances in his own experience to illustrate the power and  blessings attending him while attending acting in the Lesser Priesthood.  Those who would magnify their callings in the smallest office in the  Priesthood were as much entitled to the blessings and powers pertaining to their  respective callings as the Apostles in their sphere. The hour of Gods  judgement was at hand and it was important that the saints should  magnify their callings. We need not fear the wicked for God would  fight our battles, and all would be fulfilled that had been declared con-  cerning Zion. He regretted that there were so many who were indifferent  to their callings. It was important that the brethren and sisters should  sustain the various organizations effected for the benefit of the Saints  both young and old. He urged the Saints to read the revelations  of God, and to become familiar with the will of the Lord and His  purposes concerning this people.

 President Wilford Woodruff said, that when the saints came here  they had their inheritances divided to them, and he did not feel that  he had a right to sell to anyone, and he would not lease land for a sa-  loon or any immoral purpose. We should maintain our inheritances, for  those who are not Saints did not come here to build up Zion. 
 -2-    and accomplish the desires of your hearts. We are all ^well^ as usual. Brother   Joseph joins me in saying God bless you, and remember us kindly to our  friends Clawson, the Colonel, and General C.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff   
 President Wilford Woodruff was pleased with the interest that was being  manifested in these associations.  The time in which we were living required that   we should prepare and qualify ourselves for the promotion of the cause of Zion, and   all such organizations would have this tendency, having been organized under the   inspiration of God. He was thankful that he lived in a time and with a peo-  ple who believed in and sought for the faith and enjoyed the same that was once   delivered to the Saints. Zion was growing and the glory of God would soon begin   to rest upon her, and it was important that we laid aside all that was between   us and the Almighty.  He urged the importance of making full and prompt re-  ports, and testified that the interest in these organizations would increase.  He also   urged the necessity of the young storing their minds with the contents of sacred  books and particularly the Doctrine and Covenants. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said that the God of Israel had called this  people out of the world and we need not be surprised if they are opposed to  us, for the world had always persecuted the Saints of God, and the only  hope for the deliverance of this people was in the God of Israel. He would  sustain and deliver us if we trusted in Him. This gosepl had been rejected  by the Jews and was then preached to and received by the Gentiles. They in  turn fell into apostasy. When the gospel was restored again it was preached  first to the Gentile nations and as a result of the proclamation of the Gospel  this people had been gathered from the four quarters of the earth. In other  ages men had made laws to entrap the people of God, and in all cases  where men had proven faithful, God had been the friend of His people.  This nation was in the hands of God and He would sustain his people   if they would do what was right and trust in God. This work was set  up never more to be thrown down and no power could stay it progress.  The blindness and hypocrisy of the world which was wallowing in cor-  ruption in railing against the Latter-day Saints was to be lamented,  and must call forth the indignation of a righteous God. It was for us  to look to ourselves and set our own houses in order, and trust in God  and all would be well with us, and the nearer we drew to God the  more we would increase in light and intelligence. The spirits of this  people had been reserved to come forth in this day and some of the great-  est and best of the children of God that had ever been upon the earth  had come and were coming forth in our day. 
 Prest W Woodruff he bore a strong testimoney to this work  being of God and said he would still sustain it as  he had done in the past in spite of all opposing  powers all combined against it 
 Prest Woodruff   bore testimoney to the truth of Bro Cannons remarks  and said that out of the fourteen hundred millions of  the peoples of the earth not more then half of a  million had been baptized into this church, and it  would only be a few compared th with the countless  numbers of the teeming millions of the earth that  would gain the celestial Kingdom of our God 
 Prest Woodruff gave us some of his early missionary  experience and said he had only been instrumental  in the hands of the Lord and all honor was due  to God 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff adressed himself to the Priest-  hood. Told how the Prophet Joseph received the various keys and  powers for the restoration of Zion and the establishment of the king-  dom of God on the earth in these days. Repeated the words of Joseph  to the Twelve, when he rolled off the burden of those duties from his  shoulders to theirs, and reminded his brethren that they too must step for-  ward and take the places of those who were about to pass away, and  be ready to carry on the work of God in the earth. There was a   great change about to take place in Zion, and in Babylon. The Saints  should seek God in their secret closets, attend their prayer circles,  and not esteem these things lightly. Inasmuch as they did this  they should know the mind and will of God concerning them, and  be better prepared to accomplish it. 
 President Wilford Woodruff delivered a discourse upon the blessings  and opportunities enjoyed by the Saints the fulfillment of prophecy in the   experience and labors of the people of God; dwelling also for some time on  the importance and efficacy of prayer. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it was gratifying to listen to the words of men  who were alive to their callings. There was a spirit of improvement among the people  through the Church generally. He refered particularly to the marked disposition  on the part of the Saints, of late, to observe the Word of Wisdom. He felt gratified   with the spirit that was manifested among the young, giving promise of a multitude  whom the Lord may find worthy to carry on his work. Those who were called to lead  should not be arbitrary in their course, but rather appeal to the judgment of those  under them, by teaching good principles and setting a good example. 
 President Wilford Woodruff spoke of the great responsibility devolving upon   those who held the Priesthood. It was difficult to express this in words. There were  many millions who died without a knowledge of the truth, to whom the gospel  must be preached and for whom the gospel ordinances must be administered. His   faith was that this people had been reserved for the purpose of accomplishing this  labor, and the inhabitants of this earth who had passed away were looking with  interest to the labors of the servants of God in our day, and he was pained to learn  that considering our limited members, there should be any among us who were in-  different to their calling. Our time here was but short to prepare for the great eter-  nity. He had no fears with regard to the destiny of the work of God. The Lord was on  our side and He would protect us. 
 President Wilford Woodruff. Said it made no difference to  the work of the Lord what man or men died. He intended to carry  on the work in his own manner. The twelve sons of Jacob were  blessed and promised what should befall them to the latest date.   This was evidenced in the histories of the world. God will always  have a law-giver in Israel, and any man who supposed the work   could not get along without him would find sooner or later that   he is entirely mistaken. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said that it was our duty to extend   our settlements over the land and occupy it. In pursuance of this   policy a number had been called to go to Arizona to settle there, but   many had gone to the wrong places which had left the Saints at the   settlement of St Johns weak-handed, and as a consequence to a great ex-  tent subject to depredations from lawless individuals located at that   place. It was considered wise to protect the Saints in their rights  in St. Johns, which was the key to the whole Arizona country and one  of the best locations in it, and to that end the authorities had felt  prompted to send more missionaries there to strengthen the hands of   the Saints and others desirous of preventing lawlessness. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Next arose and said as the funeral ser-  vices on this occasion not only em-  braced the death of Brother David  Hoagland Cannon, whose tabernacle  now laid before the congregation, but  a great many other Elders who  had yielded up their lives while  preaching the Gospel to the nations of  the earth, an endeavor had been made  to publish these cases as far as they  had come to the knowledge of the  authorities, and Apostle Richards  would therefore read to those assembled  the list already furnished. After this  Brother Grant would read one of the  last letters written home from abroad  by the late David H. Cannon. 
 It is time to close this conference,  but before closing I want to say a few  words to the Latter-day Saints.  I have  attended conferences under the presi-  dency of Joseph Smith during his life  time, from 1833; I have attended con-  ferences under President Brigham  Young nearly forty years, from the  time of the death of Joseph Smith un-  til his own death; I have attended  conferences under the presidency of  John Taylor, and I have attended  conferences as President of the Church  myself since that period.  That re-  sponsibility has rested upon me, and  rests upon me today.  Sixty-four  years of my life have passed away as  a member of this Church.  I do not  know that I shall ever address you  again; I cannot tell anything about  this; but I feel strongly impressed to  say a few words to you upon pric-  ciple, although it is late.    I want these Latter-day Saints to  lay to heart what has been said to you  by the Apostles and Elders who have  spoken at this Conference.  I want  to say another thing.  I prophesy, in  the name of Israel's God, the day has  come when the mouths of Wilford  Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, Joseph  F. Smith and these Twelve Apostles,  should not be closed because of the  opinions of the children of men.  There  have been feelings that these men  holding high positions--the Twelve  Apostles and Presidency--should say  nothing about politics.  I want to say  to you here, the day has come when  God Almighty requires at your hands  to unite together in your temporal  business, and in your politics, so far  as it is wisdom.  I do not care whether  a man is a Republican or a Democrat,  in that he is fre; but it is your duty  to unite in electing good men to gov-  ern and control your cities, your local  affairs, and I will state that when you  do not do this you are losers of the  blessings of Almghty God.  I  want to tell you this upon  this occasion.  My mouth shall  not be closed upon these  principles.  I know it is the duty of the  Latter-day Saints to unite together  in your local affairs, the election of  your city councils, the election of  your city councils, the election of men  to act for you in the affairs of state.  Lay aside your extremes in democ-  racy and republicanism, as far as is  wise in that matter, and in other than  local matters as Latter-day Saints  unite together within your party lines  and appoint good men. When you do  that, God will bless you.  You won't  all be taxed to death andlose your  property, if you will appoint good men  and pursue this course.    I take the liberty, as President of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, of making these remarks.  No  matter what the feelings of men may  be towards me; I shall not stay in this  country very long.  But I realize   very well that this people are groaning  under poverty, under affliction, under  taxation, and in positions that they  ought not to be if they would only unite  together and do their duty.  And this  idea of a person being afraid of some-  body because he is a Democrate or a  Republican, it is all wrong.  I feel  like saying to you, as the President  of this Church, and do state, that it  is your duty to unite together and ap-  point good men to act in every capac-  ity for the public welfare.  Therefore  let us do our duty, walk uprightly be-  fore the Lord ourGod, and leave the  consequences with Him.  "Do what is  right, let the consequences follow;"  which may God grant, for Christ's  sake.  Amen. 
 REMARKS BY PRESIDENT  WOODRUFF.    President Woodruff was then pre-  sented to the audience by Mayor Clark  and was received with the warmest  demonstrations of applause.  The ven-  erable Pioneer and leader said in sub-  stance:    It was fifty-one years ago yesterday,  a little before 11 o'clock a. m., that he  drove President Young in his carriage  on to the spot where the Knutsford  hotel now stands. On his arrival in the  valley, the speaker had, he said, one  bushel and a half of potatoes in his  possession. He had covenanted with  the Lord that he would neither eat  nor drink until they were planted, and  he kept his promise. Others of the  Pioneers also had potatoes with them.  They, too, promptly attended to the  work of planting. And they were  planted in the earth, not in the moon  (dark or light) as brother Orson Pratt  objected to that. (Laughter).    There was a man in Nauvoo who built  a carriage to suit his own fancy. It  had a bed 11 feet long, and was en-  tered by means of steps and door. This  vehicle the speaker bought and brought  to this valley. On the Monday morn-  ing immediately after the arrival of  the first Pioneers President Young  took some of the Twelve Apostles, and  with them walked on a short distance  in a northwesterly direction; a halt was  suddenly made and President Young,  striking his cane upon the ground, ex-  claimed, "Brethren, here will be the  Temple of our God."  "I didn't ask  him," continued President Woodruff,  "who told him the Temple would be  there. I didn't care. I put a stake  there and the Temple is there, a monu-  ment to President Young's foresight  and prophetic accuracy."    After passing over the ground, which  is now Pioneer Square, the party en-  tered wagons and started for the  Point of the Mountain, which ap-  peared to be about five miles to the  westward. The distance, however, was  much greater, being about fifteen  miles. They continued on to Black  Rock where President Young, plunged  in the brine and toook a bath, being  the first Mormon to lave in its  waters. He was followed by other mem-  bers of the party among whom was a  colored man. When the latter emerged  from the waves the salt brine dried  upon his skin and instead of being a   black man he was perfectly white.  (Laughter.) This transformation, Por-  ter Rockwell declared to be the first  miracle performed in the valley. (Re-  newed merriment). But when he  washed himself in fresh water the salt  disappeared and once more the white  man was black. (Laughter and ap-  plause.)    On reaching here the Pioneers were  importuned to continue their journey  to California where it was believed  their condition could be bettered.  President Young said he knew he was  in the midst of a desert with his people,  but that would make no difference  They would build a temple, a city and  a commonwealth here.  When the first  message flashed across the the  new electric means of com-  munication, the words were:  "What has God wrought?' And so re-  garding the declaration of President  Young, the speaker felt constrained  to say:  "What has God wrought?" In  these mountain vales are now cities  and town bedecked with temples of  worship, school houses, colleges and  the various conditions of an advanced  civilization.    Here President Woodruff paused  briefly and then said: "Wonderful  changes have come to this land and  people since the arrival of the Pioneers,  and I want to say that the changes,  the progress and increase will be just  as great during the next fifty-one years  as during a similar period that has  just closed. The destiny of this people  is before heaven and earth and noth-  ing can stay it."    President Woodruff then said he would  speak of one incident and only one  connected with the journey of the Pio-  neers hither.  It was suggested to him  by the presence on the stand of W. C.  A. Smoot, who was the youngest teams-  ter in the advance guard. It occurred  near the Platte river. One day the  little band of home and liberty seekers  were startled by seeing to the west,  directly ahead of them, what appeared  to be a great black cloud close to the  earth. To their amazement they dis-  covered on approaching nearer that it  was not a cloud, but a solid, mighty,  moving body of buffalo, probably the  greatest herd that had ever assembled  in the western world. There was great  danger of being crushed to death by  the mighty horde. What to do was a  problem. But after consultation a  wedgelike column was thrown out and  an opening effected in the herd. Among  this animated mass of the monarchs of  the mountains and plains they  struggled on and on for their  own personal salvation for three days  and nights. At one time Brother Smoot  lost a horse which got mixed up with  the buffalo which were traveling not  in a scattered condition but just as  close together as animals could crowd  together. For ia time it seemed as  though the loss would be permanent,  but after a while the horse was re-  covered.    "It always was," said President  Woodruff in his closing reference to the  incident, "a mystery to me why that  great bady of buffalo should have gath-  ered together and marched from its  roaming place on the slopes of the  Rocky Mountains and moved down on  to the Platte. It never occurred be-  fore; it never occurred since, and will  never occur again."    As a finale to his address President  Woodruff said he felt that it was his  duty to give President Brigham Young  the credit of having laid the founda-  tion of this city and State. The streets  of Salt Lake City, for instance, were  the widest and most beautiful of any  city on the earth. In the historic city  of Jerusalem, two loaded camels found  it difficult to pass each other. In this  city, thirty of those caravans of the  desert could do so. President Young  believed in fulfilling the commandments  of God. He believed in doing things  well. That was a characteristic of the  Pioneers, no matter what the cost. For  instance, a mountain was moved at a  cost of a half million dollars for a foun-  dation for the Manti Temple. 
 SALT LAKE CITY. Jan. 7, 1892.    On the occasion of the retirement of  Elder Karl G. Maeser, D.L.D., from his  active labors as an instructor and a prin-  cipal of our church schools, to devote his  full time and attention to the duties of  his exalted position as General Superin-  tendent of the Church school system, we,  the undersigned, having enjoyed for   many years the privilege of students, and  later, the honors of associate teachers  under his immediate tuition and direc-  tion do seek to express, though of neces-  sity in a feeble and an inadequate man-  ner, the esteem and the honor with which  Dr. Maeser and his labors are regarded  by us.    This we do with the approval and  co-operation of the General Board of  Education of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.    Dr. Maeser is in truth the Pioneer   Teacher in the Church schools of our   people, and since beginning his labors  here he has held a foremost place among   the educators of Utah. During the six-  teen years of his most efficient and di-  vinely inspired principalship, the Brig-  ham Young academy of Provo has ad-  vanced from the position of a lower grade  school to that of an academy in fact, with  worthy graduates counted by hundreds  and present and former students num-  bering thousands.    We feel that we, in common with the   youth of our people, owe to Brother  Maeser an incalcuable debt of gratitude  for his precepts and example, and his  whole souled devotion in the cause of  education amongst us.    Our relations with him as our senior  teacher, principal, brother and friend  have been of the most pleasant nature  and our affection for him is that of sons,  for a loving parent.    While we feel that his removal from   the field of active teaching is a loss, we  find consolement in the know-  ledge that the scope of his in-  valuable labors is greatly expanded, and   we rejoice that our relations with him   will not be entirely severed, for in his  capacity as General Superintendent of  Church Schools we shall still regard him   as a counselor and a director of our  labors.    Our earnest prayers will be that health,  peace and success may attend him in his  work of love for the youth of Zion, and   that the All-wise Father may long spare   his life to us and our people.    In behalf of the General Board of Edu-  cation.    WILFORD WOODRUFF, Psesident,  GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary,  J. E. TALMAGE, D.S.D.,  WILLARD DONE, D.B.,  JOSEPH NELSON,  J. J. WALTON,  RICHARD HAAG. 
 President Wilford Woodruff arose and spoke as follows:  I wish to say to this assembly of Latter-day Saints that there are  three vancancies in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, in   consequence of the organization of the First Presidency. We have   felt that it is time to fill that quorum now: at this conference,   and the people should be prepared for the presenting by the Twelve  Apostles of such names as they may feel by the Spirit of God   to be worthy and proper persons to receive this ordination or to   occupy this position. These Apostles are Prophets, Seers and   Revelators. I have confidence in them, I believe they have power  to present such things as would be in accordance with of God.  They (the Apostles) presented to me a list of names. I wish   here to say, and I want it understood, that neither myself, Presi-  dent George Q. Cannon nor President Joseph F. Smith, who are my   Counselors, presented any of these names. We left it with the   Quorum of the Apostles. I became thoroughly satisfied that   they had upon that list such names as would be acceptable  to the Lord. We took those and made it a matter of prayer,   and the Spirit of the Lord manifested unto me those whom  we should appoint. They have all been accepted by the Quor-  um of the Apostles as well as the Presidency of the Church. I have   a reason for making these remarks. 
 "Presidents Office,  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 2, 1889.    To the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors.    Dear Brethren:    There never was a time probably in our history, when the Latter-  day Saints needed more than they do at present the assistance which God  has promised to render to us. He has made precious promises to His  Church; among them He has said that no weapon that is formed  against Zion shall prosper. This will be fulfilled to the very letter. The  Lord's word cannot fail. But it is for us, as a people, to place ourselves  in such a condition that we can ask the Lord in faith for these bless-  ings, and receive them at His hand. We should so live that He will  feel bound by His promises to come to our aid and to fulfil His  words to us. We have never appealed to Him in vain. He has always   listened to our supplications when we have approached Him aright.  The knowledge of this encourages us to cry unto Him as an entire  people, with united voice. And that we may do this in a proper  manner we have felt led to set apart the next anniversary of the 
 President Woodruff said he had  often heard of surprise parties  and had attended some and this  was one of them, for he was filled  with surprise to hear the roll  call answered by his own sayings  and writings, and doubted wheth-  er he could have answered with  one himself, had his name been  called. Was pleased with the  exercises of the evening and  thought it our duty to understand  the principles of our holy relig-  ion for this was the greatest dis-  pensation ever given to man.    Joseph Smith with the excep-  tion of Jesus Christ, who was the  son of the Highest, was the   greatest prophet that ever lived.  This dispensation was the be-  ginning of the end of the world.  The Prophet Joseph was chosen  in the eternal worlds to lay the  foundation of this work and that  the foundation was perfect in   every detail. The ordinance of  "Salvation for the dead" was one  of its most important principles  and it requires the inspiration of  God to comprehend it. He heard  this revelation from the mouth of  the prophet Joseph himself. Our  dead are watching us, and we  have it in our power to carry sal-  vation to them, and if we neglect 
 A Tribune reporter yesterday after-  noon called on President Wilford   Woodruff for the purpose of interview-  ing him relative to the disturbance   caused by Democratic leaders over the  recent priesthood meeting. The ven-  erable head of the Mormon church had,  however, already prepared a statement  for publication, which is as follows:    To All Whom it May Concern:  Inasmuch as there has been so much   written and said concerning the pro-  ceedings of a priesthood meeting held   in the Assembly hall on Monday, the   7th day of October, I feel it my duty  to make a statement concerning it.    I consider it the right of every man,   woman and child on earth to enjoy   their religion, let that religion be what  it may, for that is between themselves  and their Creator. So I say with re-  gard to politics. Every man has a   right to enjoy his political beilef un-  molested, let this be what it may.   There is not a Democrat in Utah Ter-  ritory who can truthfully say that I   ever asked him to vote a Republican   ticket, or join the Republican party.  Neither can any Republican say that I  ever asked him to vote a Democratic  ticket, or join the Democrats.    A part of my own family are Repub-  licans and part are Democrats. I have  never counseled one of them to change  his politics. They are, all of them,   strong, independent men, and they en-  joy their freedom without any inter-  ference of their father.    Now, concerning that meeting re-  ferred to, there was not, according to  my recollection, one word said about   Democrats, Republicans or politics.   Joseph F. Smith's remarks were upon  the same subject that the Apostles  had taught through the conference  to ten thousand people.    When the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-Day Saints was organized, it   was with the holy priesthood in its  various orders and quorums. And   when a man was appointed to the  Apostleship or Presidency, or in any  office, as a teacher of the people, it   placed him in a very grave responsi-  bility. And no man was counted at  liberty, from the organization of the   church, to engage in any branch of  business, politics, or anything else to   take him entirely away from his call-  ing, business, duty or responsibility for  a length of time, without first coun-  seling with the Presidency of the   church, or with his quorum, on its pro-  priety, and getting permission to do so.   And this order has rested upon us all   alike. And this has been my position  for sixty years of my life, and that,   too, without interfering with my man-  hood. And this course does not re-  quire a man to give up his position in  the Democratic party or in the Re-  publican.    Several Democrats have called upon  me since this campaign commenced.   Among the number was my friend,  John T. Caine, saying he had been  nominated for Governor. I said, "Go   ahead. I think you will make a good  Governor." I think so still.    Every man has his own free agency.    He has the right to withdraw from   his quorum, or the church, if he   wishes. But while he remains in his   quorum, or in the church, we think he  should be subject to the same rules  that we are ourselves. But that duty  does not require any man to withdraw  from the Democratic or Republican  party, or give up his polical princi-  ples.    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 On the afternoon of Saturday, October 8th, an Epistle from  President Wilford Woodruff, in behalf of the Twelve Apos-  tles, was read by Bishop Orson F. Whitney, the following be-  ing a brief synopsis of it:    As some of the Apostles are  prevented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, from  appearing in public, the Church will naturally look for  some expression from them concerning their feelings and   hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at the pre-  sent time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles,  because of the loss which the Church has sustained in the    Death of President John Taylor.    Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its Presi-  dent, and each time the event has produced a profound  impression upon its members. In this instance this  sad event is invested with more significance than it  would have been had it occurred in the ordinary way    President Taylor died in exile.    For about two years and a half he had been compelled  to live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public as-  sociation with the people whom he loved more than his  life.    Through his decease the Church is called the third time to  mourn the departure of the man who has stood as its Presi-  dent and as the Prophet, Seer and Revealator to this genera-  tion. The experience which the Saints have gained in pass-  ing through these trials has been of exceeding value to them.  They have learned that God can take care of His own work, and  that they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning   its management.    For some time before his death the Prophet Joseph was in-  spired of the Lord to anticipate his own departure from earth-  ly scenes. This was shown in various ways; but especially in  the great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon the  Twelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priest-

 birthday of the Prophet Joseph Smith—December 23rd,—as a day  of fasting and of solemn prayer unto the Lord.    It is for this end that we address this circular to you, that all the Latter-  day Saints throughout these mountains may be informed that the day  mentioned is designated and set apart as a day of general fasting and  prayer for the whole Church, and that the Saints may assemble at their  various meeting houses and devote the day to prayer to Almighty   God in behalf of Zion.    We need not describe at any length the reasons there are for making   in this united appeal to our Great Creator. They are familiar to you  and to all the people. It is easy to perceive that we are menaced  with a total deprivation of our rights as free men and as citizens,  because we are members of the Church of the Lamb of God. Look  which way we will and there appears no earthly help of which   we can avail ourselves. But we can turn to the Lord in per-  fect confidence that he will hear and help us.    ^*Circulars   [beginning]   at were furn  ished the Bish  ops, Presidents   of Prayer Circles,   and a few other   brethren^    *We think the fast should be from sundown on Sunday, the   22nd, to sundown on Monday, the 23rd, covering a period of  twenty-four hours.    ^Was not in   the Bishop's   Etc Circulars^    We desire you to take immediate steps to notify the Bishops  and their Counselors, and other presiding officers in your Stakes, of  the appointment of this Fast Day, that it may be known to all   the Saints of your Stakes.    ^In Cirular^    All labor that can be dispensed with should be suspended on that   day, and the people should assemble themselves—men, women  and children—and humble themselves before the Lord, and  call upon Him in mighty prayer to look with mercy and  tender compassion upon the people of His Church.    Among other subjects for which we should pray on the Fast Day,  now set apart, the following should not be forgotten:    We should pray for the plots and the schemes which are being  framed for the purpose of robbing us of our civil and political rights  and of obtaining control of our cities, counties and Territory, to be  confounded, and their authors to be thwarted in their evil designs.    We should pray for all who conspire, in any manner, to injure or  destroy the work of God, or take from the people their rights and lib-  erties, to be defeated in their wicked purposes.    We should pray for the unfavorable action of courts and officials  to be overruled in such a manner that no injury will be done to Zion.    We should pray for the Executive of our nation, for the Cabinet, the  Senate, the House of Representatives, the Judiciary and the people of  our nation to be so influence and controlled that their hearts will  be softened towards the people of God, and that they may not 
 this duty we shall meet with  bitter reproaches when we meet  them on the other side. The  Lord had the element of power  to carry on this work and He  would raise up choice spirits to  bear it off triumphantly. This  labor is necessary but it can nev-  er be fully understood until we  reach the spirit world, but we   understand sufficient to accom-  plish a great deal. We have  been reserved in the spirit world  to come forth and participate in   this glorious work. The duties  of the different associations are  very great. The young men and   women should be taught that it  is a calamity to marry outside of  the Church, and if they under-  stood the gospel thoroughly they  would never do it. No people  upon the earth had labored  harder to accomplish God's pur-  poses than the Latter-day Saints.  It is the privilege of every indi-  vidual to receive revelation for  his own guidance. He would   have been in the spirit world  long ago but for listening to the   whisperings of the still small  voice, which is a key to guide us  aright. At the dedication of the  Salt Lake Temple he was strongly  impressed that from that time  angels would go forth from God's   presence and execute judgment  upon the wicked and reap in  their midst as with a sickle.  God had withheld these calami-  ties until many of the just were  gathered. His judgments were  now abroad in the earth in varied  forms, and this was only the be-  ginning. He asked God's bless-  ing upon the audience. 
 HIS PURPOSE    President Woodruff Dis-  cusses His Political  Address.    WHAT HE HAD IN VIEW    He Says He Spoke as a Bur-  dened Taxpayer.    ATTITUTE TOWARD PARTIES.    He States that He is in Favor of the  Continuance of Present Party Di-  visions, Except in City Affairs—He  Did not Mean to Say that there  Should not be Partisanship in  State Elections—Claims the Right  to Speak on Political Questions,  not as the Head of the Mormon  Church, but as a Citizen—This was  what He Meant, He Says, When  He Declared that the Time had  Come When His Mouth Should not  be Closed on Political Matters—His  Address Caused Much Discussion  and Bitter Condemnation—George  Q. Cannon's Position.    In response to questions asked by a  Tribune reporter, President Woodruff  yesterday discussed his conference ad-  dress on politics. He entered into an  explanation of his object in making the  address and his purpose in using the  language which has caused such a sen-  sation. He was first asked:    PURPOSE OF THE ADDRESS.    "What purpose did you have in view  in giving your people this political ad-  vice?"    "I had in mind," said President  Woodruff, "the financial condition of  our city and the heavy taxation its  property owners are bearing. I know  how heavy it is from my own experi-  ence. On the Valley house property,  which I own, I say from $1200 to $1500  taxes a year, and my income from the   Valley house is but $50 per month. I  get but little revenue from the balance  of the property. I talked as a tax-  payer to other taxpayers—not as the  head of the Mormon church to Mor-  mons. I felt that the time had come  when there should be a change in the  way of managing our city affairs, so  that we might have officials who would  not be merely after the loaves and  fishes."    WHAT HE ADVISED.    "Did you mean to advise Mormons to  cease being Republicans and Demo-  crats?"    "No, I did not. I am in favor of par-  ties. I wanted the people to work for  the election of good men to our city  offices. That was all. I did not advise  the election of Mormons to office. I am  anxious for the election of men,  whether Mormons or non-Mormons, who  will manage our city affairs economi-  cally. I do not wish my remarks to be  understood as applying to people of our  church only. As a citizen and tax-  payer, I desire all good citizens to unite  for the election of good officers."    CITY NON-PARTISANSHIP.    "But what method of union did you  have in mind? Did you mean that Re-  publicans should work within their  party lines to elect good Republicans  and Democrats within their party to  elect good Democrats?"    "I did not care how they did it, so  long as they voted for good men. But  I spoke especially with reference to  non-partisanship in city affairs—not to  the present non-partisan movement,  but to non-partisanship in general. I  felt that the experience of the city  showed that it would be better not to  have party spirit control in our city  offices, but that the city's affairs should  be managed in a business way."    AS TO TICKETS.    "Is it true, as claimed, that your  purpose was to direct your church  members to vote the Non-Partisan  ticket?"    "I did not refer to any ticket. I   did not have any particular ticket in   mind. I have not had time to pay  much attention to tickets. I was sim-  ply advocating the prinicple of non-  partisanship in city matters. I have  no desire to pitch into Republicans  and Democrats. I think parties are  needed, as a general thing. I spoke  spontaneously, and did not mean to  say that there should be non-partisan-  ship in State and National affairs. I  meant that we should elect good men  to all offices, but it was about city  officers that I was thinking when I  urged people to unite regardless of  party. I had in mind particularly our  heavy city debts and expenses. I   want it to be clearly understood that I  do not want to break up the parties.  I want them to exist here. I have no  intention to urge that they be broken  away from in State affairs. It would  not be wise to do away with our  present party lines."    SPEAKS OF HIS RIGHTS.    "What did you mean by saying that  the time had come when the mouths of  the church authorities should not be  closed as to politics?"    "I meant that we had the right to  express our views as citizens. It has  been claimed, not only by people out-  side of the church, but by Mormons  as well, that the higher church officers  should be silent in political matters.  But I differ from them. As President  of the Mormon church I claim no right  to dictate to any one in politics. When  I speak on political matters I speak  simply as a citizen, interested in the  welfare of the people. I feel that I  have a right, as an individual Ameri-  can citizen, to speak on political ques-  tions. I don't think that any man, be-  cause he is a priest, has any right to  dictate in politics. But I claim that a  Mormon priest has as much right to  speak of political matters as has a  Methodist or a Baptist minister or a  Catholic priest. He has no right,  however, to use his priesthood to in-  fluence people politically, and I have  no intention of using mine for that  purpose."

 President Woodruff's personal testimony.    I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last man living in the  flesh who was present upon that occasion feel it a duty I   owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to  the House of Isreal, and to the whole world to bear this my  last testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4,  Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostles  together in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many days  with us in giving us our endowments, and teaching us  those glorious principles which God had revealed to him.  And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in our  midst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great and  last dispensation which God had set His hand to perform up-  on the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if with  consuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with much  of the power of God, and his face shone and was transpar-  ently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgotten  in time or eternity, with the following language:    "Brethern, I have had great sorrow of heart for fear that I might be  taken from the earth with the keys of the Kindom of God upon me, with-  out sealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed upon  my head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing and  building up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth,  and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now bre-  thern, I thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled   to give you your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your heads  all the powers of the Aaronic and Melchisedek Priesthoods and Apos-  tleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed upon  me; and I now roll off all the labor, burden and care of this Church  and Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now command you  in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, and  bear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, and  before God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned"    And the same spirit that filled the room at that time burns  in my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophet  of God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to stand  at the head of the Church and direct its affairs.

Richards:    Beloved Brethren,  As I stated in my last,  under date of December 13th, that it was my intention to open  and keep up a correspondence with you, I now again attempt  to fulfil that promise. Since my last letter was written every  thing connected with the Work in these lands has continued  to move on harmoniously and with tolerable success. The Elders  and Saints have, generally, manifested a disposition to throw  off every feeling of lethargy and to engage in the discharge  of their duties with greater energy than ever. I feel, however,  that there is still room for abundant improvement in all, and  I trust we will not rest satisfied until it is made.    [Redacted name] whose excommunication I mentioned in  my last, has been doing all in his power to public lectures  of the most wicked and malignant character, to arouse a  spirit of hatred and persecution against us. He has fully  abandoned himself to the influence of the spirit of Satan, and  indulges in every conceivable slander against us. So far, his  efforts have been attended with no particular results; for blind  as many people are respecting the Truth, they are not so

 THE WAR WITH SPAIN.    Letter on the Subject from the First Presi-  dency to Governor Wells—Latter-day Saints  Should Respond with Alacrity to the Gov-  ernment's Call.    Executive Office.  Salt Lake City, Utah, April 28, 1898.    To the Editor:    I am in receipt of the accompanying let-  ter from the First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, which I should be pleased to  have you publish.    Very Respectfully,  HEBER M. WELLS, Govenor.    Office of the First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints,    Salt Lake City, Utah,  April 28, 1898.    Hon. Heber M. Wells, Governor of the  State of Utah:    Dear Governor—We have read with  much interest your proclamation to the  people of our State, in which you call,  in response to the proclamation of the  President of the United States, for the  enlistment of 500 men to furnish Utah's  quota of the 125,000 volunteers called  for by the President to serve in the  army of the United States for two  years.    The people whom we represent are  lovers of peace, and would do anything  in their power, consistent with honor  and the patriotic duty which every citi-  zen owes to his country, to avert war,  and its dreadful train of consequences.  Because of this feeling we have been  led to admire to course which has  been taken by President McKinley  throughout this Spanish imbroglio, and  we have hoped that his effort to pre-  serve peace between the two countries  would result in success.    But war has been declared, and we  have it to meet. Our citizens are called  upon to enlist, and Utah is asked to  furnish cavalry and batteries of artil-  lery approximating 500 men.    We trust that the citizens of Utah  who are Latter-day Saints will be  found ready to respond with alacrity  to this call which is made upon our  State. There was a time in the past  when we were called upon, as a re-  ligious organization, to make a far  greater sacrifice than this, under cir-  cumstances that were exceedingly   painful. Then there was no hesita-  tion; but upwards of one-third of the  men of suitable age formed a battal-  ion of 500, left the camp and vol-  unteered to take part in the Mexican  war. In like manner there should be  no hesitation now; and we sincerely  trust that your recruiting officers will  find our co-religionists as ready now  to enlist and march to the defense of  their country as their fathers were in   the days to which we refer.    Trusting that you will be eminently  successful in raising Utah's proper  quota of volunteers, and praying that  the Almighty will protect our nation in  the hour of trial and assist us in our  battles for humanity and right, we  remain. Very respectfully,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEO. Q. CANNON,  JOS. F. SMITH,    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 be inclined to listen to the slanderous reports and falsehoods which are circu  lated concerning us, and which may be brought before them; and that all  the officers of our nation may be inspired with such wisdom, justice and mer-  cy that they will fill their stations so as to gain the love and esteem of the people  and the approbation of the Lord.    In the event of the decision of the Supreme Court not being rendered before   the Fast Day concerning our property which has been seized, we should  pray to the Lord to so move upon the hearts of the Judges that they will be  strengthened and filled with courage, so as to render a righteous decision.    We should pray for the Lord to soften the hearts of the people of our nation,  and to open their eyes that they may see us in our true light and be in-  clined to treat us with that kindness and consideration which are due to  fellow citizens who are loyal and true in upholding the Constitution of  our great country.    We should pray for the Lord to come to our help and to deliver us from  the many snares that are spread around us for our overthrow and des-  truction; to make our path plain before us; to lead us so that we may es-  cape from the pits that are dug for our feet.    We should pray that the Lord will pour out in great power His Holy  Spirit and the gifts thereof upon His servants, that every man may be  filled with the qualifications and power which are necessary to enable  him to magnify his office acceptably before the Lord; and that He will  fill the hearts of His Saints with comfort and peace, and witness unto them  that He has not forgotten and does not neglect Zion.    Of course, there are many other blessings that can be prayed for. But  we feel to mention these as being subjects that are prominent in our  minds, and to which our attention is called at the present time, and   for which we ourselves exercise faith before the Lord.    In closing, we suggest to yourselves and the Saints that however  much we may feel aggrieved at the acts of men towards us, we  should not pray for their condemnation. Let us confess our  own sins and pray that we may be forgiven for them, and leave  other sinners to the Lord, who has said that judgment is His, and  He will repay.    -[End of Circular furnished the Bishops Etc Etc]-    Praying to the Lord that He will fill you and the Saints un-  der your presidency with His Holy Spirit and give unto you the   spirit of faith and prayer.    We remain, your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints."

 (2)    utterly destitute of reason and sense as to fail to be perceive his  inconsistency and falsehood, ^he^ having told them two stories, both of  which cannot possibly be true. An apostate, of the name of  Parrott stirs the Elders up occasionally by raising a mob when-  ever he can to annoy them and to disturb our meetings. He gave  me a chariavari early in January, while visiting Bristol  to attend a Conference; but he did not succeed in interrupt-  ing our proceedings or in preventing us from enjoying ourselves.  Since then, he has paid Elder Bramall and the Saints in South-  ampton a visit and issued handbills of an exciting and in-  flammatory character, and has delivered public lectures against  us for the avowed purpose of interfering with an putting a  stop to all our labors in this country. One of his handbills is  headed "One Hundred Guineas Reward" to Bro. Bramall  and some others of the Elders and myself, if we will meet him  and prove our doctrines true upon a certain night, named in  the placard. That night he had a large audience in expecta-  tion of a discussion; but there being nobody there to meet him,  and the people being disappointed in seeing the fun which  they expected, they left as many as twenty at a time and at  the conclusion of his lecture there were scarcely any present.  He disgusts every decent person who goes to hear him, and though  he succeeded in obtaining a "Reverend" for his chairman in  his first lectures he became so ashamed of his connexion with  Parrott, that he left him. I counselled Bro. Bramall to  refrain from noticing him in the least. He and the Saints  have adopted this policy and thus far it has been attended  with the happiest results. In Bath our people are much  persecuted by a mob incited and headed by members of an

 Bro Taylor, there is another subject I wish   to say a few words upon (although it is against the   wish of Bro Lot Smith) it is this. Sunset, Brigham   City, and St Joseph who live in the United Order  have been very zealous to sustain the Z. C. M. I. in   Salt Lake in all their purchases but they have  been the most unfortunate of human beings in all  their deal with that Institution, especially in all  Machinery, Bro Smith sent money to buy the best  threshing machine in market, sent to R Burton &  E. F. Sheets to help pick it out, it was put unto  Hiram Clawsons hands and he sent an old  Whitmans threshing machine that he had had   on hand a long time and could not sell to any   body else, and it was freighted down here to   Sunset 700 miles and as soon as it was opened it  would have been taken back if it had not been  more than 300 miles, it has been a curse to them  ever since it was brought here, in spite of all  they can do it wastes grain and only can thresh

 from 200 to 300 Bushels a day with the best of   attention; and all three of these settlements have  to depend on it to thresh their wheat, it is now brok-  en down so that it cannot be be used at all   until a pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or  Z. C. M. I. Bro Smith has sent to both places for  one. He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op,  when it came to Sunset it all came in one box  Indigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils,  school books &c. all mixed ^together^ in one compound. There  has been something wrong with almost every piece  of machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z  C. M. I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane   mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawson  who sent a small one horse mill with some parts  missing when it arrived. It was entirely too  small for their use and last of all though not  least they wanted to start a tannery had their  vats in place and tanner and materials all  on hand, they wanted a bark mill and sent  money by Bro Flake and when he arrived    at Beaver he not going to Salt Lake requested  the Beaver Co-op, who is dealing with the Z  C. M. I. to send for a bark mill for the Sunset  Tannery. Bro Smith had to send an extra  team to the ferry to bring it but when it arrived  behold! and Lo! it turned out to be a little  giant, a corn-cob mill and not suitable  for grinding bark at all, now all has to wait  until a bal^r^k mill can be bought at St  Louis, brought to the terminns by vail and   then freighted from there by way of Albuquer-  que. Now is not this enough to try the patience  of Saints? to say nothing about sinners, I think  it is. I think that persons living as far from  Salt Lake as these settlements are who wish to  patronize their own Institutions and pay   down should have a little care and pains  taken for them and not make such blunders  as have been made towards them. The people  of this country do not think that Bro Clawson  has done them justice. They did not know

 (3)    "anti-Mormon" association, which exists in that city. They  have hired a hall quite close to that occupied by the Saints  and are doing all in their power to break up our meetings there.    A man by the name of Charles Derry, waited upon me  atwo or three weeks ago to ask me, as he said, for the privilege  of setting forth his principles to our congregations in our chapels  throughout the country. He said he was a missionary sent over  by the "New Organization of the Church" under young Joseph.  IMy reply was, that he could not have that privilege. He thought  I was not as fair with him as we wished others to be with  us—that we asked others for the privilege of preaching in their  halls, but would not grant him ours for such a purpose. I  told him, that I would feel very differently were he an honest  sectarian, who wished to set forth his views in sincerity; but  he, himself, had once known the truth and had apostatized from  it, and those who sent him where in the same condition, and  I knew they were neither honest nor sincere. I knew their  history well, and knew them to be base, bad men. He said I  was afraid of the truth, and feared investigation. I replied  that I knew the truth, and that there was no need at this  late hour to investigate the claims of such fellows as he,  for we had learned it through long years of sad experience.  He then wanted to know, (though he prefaced his request  by the remark that he thought I would not grant it) if I  would publish the "General Epistle of President Joseph Smith."  I told him of course I would not. He then left. On ^the^ Sunday  morning following I found him esconsed in a seat in one  corner of the chapel, when I went in. After I got through speaking

 (4)    he rose, and requested the privilege of making some re-  marks. I repeated my refusal, and as he was disposed to  be pertinacious, I told him that if he did not sit down im-  mediately I should put him in charge of a police officer. At  that he caved. After meeting he came up to me and said  that it was the weight of his responsibility under which he  was laboring which induced him to rise. I replied that it  was just such a responsibility as the Devil had ever felt. He  evidently intended to arouse, if possible, a feeling of sympathy  in the minds of the people in his favor, but he failed most  signally, and when he was compelled to sit down I caught  sight of an expression on his face of baffled and disappointed  hate. Not knowing where he might direct his steps I wrote a  circular to the Presiding Elders throughout the mission, putting  them on their guard against the insidious approaches of such  "wolves in sheeps' clothing." I warned them particularly against  permitting themselves, or any of the Elders and Saints under  their jurisdiction, bto be drawn into a arg discussuion with this  man or any others with similar pretensions, telling them to  adopt the let-them-alone-severely policy. I learn by letter  from Elder Mills, that he was at West Bromwich last Sunday,  in company with some old apostates, and arose to "say a word  by way of bearing testimony," but they ^(the brethren)^ had been put upon  their guard by the counsel which had been given, and they  would allow no such thing. After meeting he wanted to   speak, and attempted to inweigh against Polygamy. The  Doctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon and the Bible were  about to be appealed to, when the brethren told him to desist  at once, and they ordered the room to be cleared, as meeting was   over. It was in this town where he married his wife before he

 (5)    emigrated to the Valley. He has been shown no quarters, how-  ever, by any of our people, and will, I am confident, do us more  good in the end than harm. I felt to predict this when I  first knew of his arrival. My teachings to the Elders and Saints  have been, not to descend from the dignity of their positions to  argue and hold controversy, neither with the Devil nor with  those filled with his Spirit; nothing can be gained, I have told  them, by reasoning with apostates, men who have known the Truth  and denied it and forfeited the Spirit of the Lord and yielded them-  selves up to the spirit of the Evil One. I have a thorough  and deep grounded dislike to these miserable liars and covenant  breakers—so many of whom are to be found within the bounds  of this "New Organization." They are a base crew of malignant,  bloodthirsty creatures who were so corrupt years ago, that they  could not bear to see holiness and purity and virtue exist em-  bodied in human nature, and therefore sought to shed the blood  of those who cherished these principles. I regret greatly thant  any of the children or relatives of our beloved prophet should be  connected in any way with such a crowd, many of whom sought  and rejoiced over the death of their father. I feel convinced,  however, that circumstances are being so overruled that they,  or at least a portion of them, will yet have their eyes open to  see their true position and where alone they can find the true  friends of their father and family. It is my prayer that they  may be thus enlightened.    [redacted] wrote me a very humble letter from  [redacted] I can scarcely reconcile its contents and the Spirit  it breathes with the fact of the girl's confession at [redacted] 
 (6)    that she had been seduced by him. I mention this letter  to you now, because in my last letter to you, I informed you  that he had denied having done any wrong with any person  in the Church, yet this girl had testified that he had ruined  her, and as I have not seen the girl, myself, I wish him  to have the benefit of the doubt in your minds which his  penitent letter has rasied in mine.    Unless some counsel should come from the President to the  contrary, I expect a number of the Valley Elders will be released  this Spring to return home. They feel very pleased at the pros-  pect of so soon enjoying the society of their families and the  Saints of God. The saints are very desirous to get away this  Spring; already applications from all quarters have commenced  flowing in to me to know if I cannot extend them a little  help to get away, some lacking more and some less money,  and these applications will increase very rapidly as the time  of emigration appro^a^ches. As yet, I have received no intima-  tion from Brother Brigham respecting the sending down of  Teams to the Frontiers to carry up the poor, and as I do not  like to make any very definite moves, or to stir the people  up very much upon the subject of Emigration until that  arrives, we feel considerably anxious to receive some word.  The people from Scandinavia are intending to come by way of  Liverpool this Season instead of via Hamburg as they did  last. We think the advantages are greater by this than the other  route. The Work is prospering there and numbers are being  added. In many Conferences, in this Mission also, the labors  of the Elders are being attended with marked success. 
 (7)    Brother John L. Smith is pursuing a very wise and saving  course towards the Saints and the people within the limits of  his mission. When everthing is considered I think the Elders  there have done and are doing remarkably well. In France  Bro. Bertrand has many grave difficulties to contend with,  which prevent him from being as successful in his labors  as he otherwise would be. He does not appear to get discouraged  or to give up trying, and occasionally baptizes a few. I proposed  to him, when I was in Paris, in view of his lengthy absence from  home and the almost ^utter^ indifference of the people to the message  of which he is the bearer, to return home this season; but left  it with himself to decide. He has since expressed a wish  to remain another year. The Holland Mission, I think from  present appearances, will have to be abandoned. You will  doubtless recollect that Elders Vander Woude and Paul A.  Schettler were appointed ^a^ missions to Holland in the  Spring of (18)61. For some time after their arrival they had but  little succeess, and Bro. Vander Woude wrote some very dis-  couraging letters here, in which he evinced but very little faith.  Money had to be sent there to sustain them, and as I had no  authority to thus use funds I mentioned the matter in a letter  to the President. He counselled the withdrawal of the Elders,  if they people would not receive their message. In the mean-  time, however, they had baptized a few, and as prospects  appeared brighter we thought it better to let them try a little   longer. As I had learned that there was difficulty in the  Branch they had raised up I thought it better to visit them to  while I was on the Continent, and concluded it would be 
 (8)    wise to separate the Elders and remove Bro. Schettler  to labor with Bro. John L. Smith, who was much in need of  his help, and with whom he could labor with greater pleasure  and harmony than where he was. I investigated the difficulty,  and though the principal opponent of Bro. Vander Woude  evidently had a bad spirit, yet Bro. Vander Woude's course  had been a very unwise one. The latter promised to do bet-  ter and the difficulty was settled, only, however, to break  out with greater violence, as I have since learned. One  object that I supposed would be gained by the removal  of Bro. Schettler would be that the Branch, as I was inform-  ed by them, would be able to sustain Bro. Vander Wonde; but  I have since learned that they refuse to sustain him—that  is, those of them who have the means—and I have been com-  pelled to forward him money to keep him from suffering.  As I have no hopes respecting his accomplishing anything  in that country I have deemed it better to release him to  return home in the Spring. I think that the right kind of  man might do good in that country, but it is without doubt,  I think, a hard field.    Bros Bigler and West still travel through the mission  and their labors are attended with very good effects.    Accept my love to yourselves, individually, and to your  families in which my wife joins. Praying the Lord to  fill you with his Holy Spirit and to endow you with the  power of your Apostleship and to preserve your lives long  upon the earth    I remain, as ever,  Your Brother,  Geo. Q. Cannon

Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept 28th 1887    The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,    Dear Brethren:    Your decision to assist my mother  has been communicated to me, and I desire to  express to you our gratitude for your generous  action. You are all, probably, aware that I  have been admitted as an attorney and counselor  in the higest court of New York, and that I have  since my graduation at the Law School of Columbia  College devoted myself more or less to the pursuit  of legal law. It is my intention to continue my  law studies since I believe that as is speculated in  that direction I shall succeed better in the Army  and at the same time provide myself with a  propension for civil life, if circumstances at some  future day render it advisable that I leave the  service. I would therefore suggest to your respect-  ful consideration that I be employed by you for such  services in the direction indicated as I shall be able  to render. After performing my military duties I  shall always have time which I could spend either  in consultation or research, or in such way as superior  counsel might indicate. I might, if thought desirable 
 assist the Deseret News by communications and corres-  pondence. It would be far more consonant  with not only my own feelings but my mother's that  you should indicate some direction is which I   might e[illegible] render you service for a stated salary  rather than depend upon your charity. Hoping  this may meet with your favorable consideration and  assuring you of my desire to serve you this way    I Remain    With great Respect  Your brother,    Richard W. Young

 President Wilford Woodruff spoke for a short time upon   the many blessings enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints; the   entrance of the Pioneers to the valley of Salt Lake, and the   marvilous manifestions of the power of God over His   people since the organization of the Church up to the   present time. The speaker dwelt on the responsibil-  ities resting upon this people, and concluded by urging  them to keep their live true to their religion, and so fulfil  the commandments of the Lord that when they had finished their  course here below, He would be satisfied with their work. 
 President Wilford Woodruff next spoke. He gave a brief  sketch of his connection with the Church from the time of  his baptism in the year 1833, when he was ordained a Teacher  and told of the thousands of miles he had traveled in the  cause of the Gospel. Every man in Israel who bore a portion  of the Priesthood should understand as far as he could the im-  portance of that calling, for the exercises of the Priesthood were  inseparably connected with the heavens. They were called upon  in this last dispensation and fulness of times to establish the  Zion and Church of God, to go forth among every nation under  heaven and bear the Gospel to the people, so far as the doors were  open unto them. They had been laboring as a Church and  people for the last 60 years, and during that time had preached  the Gospel to millions on the face of the earth, as well as gathered  hundreds of thousands into these mountain valleys and into  the fold of Christ. The speaker warmly counseled the Elders  of quorums to be true and faithful in their calling and to  be regular in their attendance in the various meetings; dwelt  on the subject of prayer, and predicted that this great latter-day  work would stand firmly until the coming of the Son of  Man, which was not a long way off. Speaking on the  subject of Temples, he expressed the hope, his life having  been spared thus far by the providence of God, that he would  live to see the dedication of the Temple on this ground.  He thanked the Lord that he was still in the midst of  the Latter-day Saints, and rejoiced in the fact that the  Lord had raised up this people in fulfilment of the  prophecies contained in the Bible. President Wood-  ruff touched upon the duties and obligations of the Saints,  individually and collectively, dwelt briefly upon the  work abroad and upon the confistication of the Church  property by the Government of the United States. Despite  all the difficulties which had surrounded this Church,  they had been able to progress and would continue un-  til the winding-up scene.

 Salt Lake City, Utah, May 9th 1893.    President Angus M Cannon and Counselors,    Salt Lake Stake of Zion.    Dear Brethren:    With this we return the recommends given by you to  members of your Stake to be present at the dedicatory services at the  Temple. We do so for the purpose that you may carefully examine  them and become acquainted with the standing of the persons recom-  mended. There were numbers who gained admission to these services  whose lives had, for many years, been inconsistent with their calling as  Saints: in fact, in some cases they were not known to be members of the  Church. But their names were found on the records, fellowship had not  been withdrawn from them, and they claimed the right, under the ruling  of the First Presidency, to be present at the dedication. These persons  having claimed this privilege by reason of their membership in the  Church, it now becomes the duty of the local authorities, Bishops and  others, to see that all such assume the responsibilities of their profes-  sion. When, in your search through the recommends, you meet  the name of any of whose standing you are in doubt, they should be  labored with in the divine spirit of love and patience, and be admon-  ished to repent of all that is unseemly and inconsistent with their call-  ings as officers or members of Christ's Holy Church. If any turn a  deaf ear to these warnings, continue in ways of indifference or sin, and  they be found unworthy of membership, they should be dealt with by the   proper councils of the Church, as the word of the Lord directs, and  their names should be stricken from the records, that the vineyard  of the Lord may be pruned and no further opportunity given to the   unworthy to repeat the course they took to gain admission to the   Temple services.    Our Heavenly Father having exercised His right to forgive,  and to say to each one of us, "Son (or daughter) thy sins be forgiven  thee," on condition that we forsake our sins and live unto 
 Official Announcement.    Salt Lake City, August 18, 1894.    To the Officers and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:  Dear Brethren and Sisters:    For several years past, the Presiding Authorities of the Church, acting in  conjunction with the General Board of Education, have operated toward the estab-  lishment of a Church University, this institution to become the head of our Church  School System, and to be equipped for the work of higher instruction. During  the past two years, steps were taken toward founding and endowing such an  institution as would meet the needs of the people of Utah, and particularly  of the Latter-day Saints, as a denominational school of high grade; and on the 8th  of September, 1893, a circular was issued announcing the opening of the Church  University.    The work of the institution was conducted during the academic  year 1893–4, with abundant proofs of success; and all connected with the manage-  ment of the Church University had reason to anticipate for the school a brilliant  future.    There was no intention on the part of the promoters of the Church  University to arouse any unfair competition or rivalry between that school  and the University of Utah; nevertheless, the existance of two institutions in  the same city, with many courses in common, rendered the paralleling of work,  and the consequent duplication of expenditure, absolutely unavoidable. Time  has very plainly demonstrated the fact that Utah, while abundantly able under  present conditions to maintain one well equipped institution for higher  instruction, cannot adequately support many such, either in material sup-  plies of means, or in students prepared for university courses of study.  After due consideration of the presents conditions and future pro[s]pects of  educational affairs in Utah, the presiding quorums of the Church have deemed  it wise to bring the work of the Church University to a close, that greater energy,  resulting from concentration of effort, may devoted to the development of our  Territorial University.    Toward the University of Utah our people may  properly indulge a feeling of pride; the institution was established in the  early days of Utah's history; it was incorporated, indeed, under the name  of the University of Deseret within less than three years after the first settlement of  this region.    It has grown in spite of the numerous difficulties incident  to pioneer existance, to its present fair proportions, and to the attainment of its  forty-fifth year, with a steady and healthful progress which inspires strong  confidence for its future.    Utah has need of such an institution of learning;  indeed there appears no reason why our University should not become the great  inter-mountain center for the diffusion of knowledge in advanced and special-  ized branches.    We hope that the day is not far distant when the youth of 
 AN ADDRESS    To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:    Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to fast and pray, and in   this manner to seek for that faith which Saints should possess, and obtain that spirit of   humility which we are commanded to cultivate.    Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the first   Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting and prayer. The members   of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day their contributations for the   relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the ward    At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient for the   people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that day. The  conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and employed,  could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the worship of the Lord.    For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a   most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who   shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear  their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under   the direction of the bishopric.    As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more   difficult for the people generally, and especially those in steady employ-  ment, to attend these meetings, until at the present time they have  dwindled to such an extent that comparatively few have the oppor-  tunity of attending them. Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer  in the Church no longer serves the object for which it was intended.    Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature deliberation,   it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been devoted   to this purpose. Instead of the customary assemblages in the various   wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have   concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day for the   regular fast meeting.    Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the   direction of the Presidents of the Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in   their several places of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday   in each month, whenever it can be done conveniently, and devote  the meeting to the administration of the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi-  mony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the   confirming of members in the Church, and to such other services as  have usually been attended to at such meetings. We feel assured  that excellent results will follow the giving of members of the Church   an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seek  for the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep His  commandments.    Care should should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants  of the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf,  that no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land 
 President Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference.  He read from Romans, chapter VIII. He followed upon the irres-  istible purposes of God, and the necessity of the Saints living in   accordance with them; the need of understanding the signs of times;   the importance of present duties, teaching children to pray, the necessity   of union, and the need of learning and appreciating the great mission  entrusted to the Latter-day Saints. 
 To The Saints.    To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints, in General Conference assembled:    Dear Brethren and Sisters—Every Latter-day Saint will recognize the   value of union, not only in action but in matters of faith and discipline.  As to the rights and authority of the Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of the   highest importance that there should be no difference of opinion among  the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 Young, R. W.    Salt Lake City, Utah,  October 2nd 1888.    Apostle Wilford Woodruff  and Brethren of the Twelve,    Dear Brethren:    I have received your communication dated  the 26th ultimo. In reply thereto I desire  to inform you of my conclusion to resign from  the army. I purpose entering upon  the practice of law in this city on the 15th of this  month, at which time I shall relinquish  the allowance heretofore, for some months, granted  me for my mother, which I take this oppor-  tunity to thank you for. If circum-  stances justify it and my services will be  of any value in the present legal crusade  against the Latter Day Saints, I would solicit  employment for such salary as you may  judge expedient.    Very respectfully,  Richard W. Young. 
 "Office of  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter day Saints    Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec 18, 1895.    Prest. Angus M Cannon,  Salt Lake Stake    Dear Brother:    At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of Apostles, held on  Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions were reached, and are now presented for the  guidance of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops and their associate officers, and all whom they  may concern.    There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes of Zion, of High Priests,  Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have been called to act in the capacity of Teachers,  having an organization, distinct from that of the Teachers Quorum, and being presided  over by a president and two counselors. The tendency of such organizations has been to  assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or quorums of the priesthood.  The question submitted was, Is it proper for such organizations to exist, or to be presid-  ed over in this manner? The Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision  is made for them in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church govern-  ment; neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that  the brethren who bear the Melchisedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers, should  not have a separate president and counselors, but that they should, when acting  in this capacity, be presided over directly by the Bishopric, whose aids they are  in all things connected with the well-being of the ward.    The second question was: At which of the meetings of the Saints should persons  guilty of unchastity be required to make confession—at the general meeting of the 
 Him in newness of life, it would be well not to impose further  conditions or to require that any of the Saints should be re-  baptized before they can be recognized as in full fellowship;  on the other hand, none should be forbidden to, in this way, renew  their covenants, if they feel that by so doing they will more fully satisfy  their consciences, or will receive thereby renewed strength to commence  a life more faithful in the observance of God's commandments.    We desire that the Presidents of quorums should act in harmony  with the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops. They should examine the  rolls of their quorums and where they find men entirely neglecting the  duties of their Priesthood and ignoring its responsibilities, they should  take the usual action therein.    Praying the Lord to bless you with His Holy Spirit, not only in  carrying out these instructions, but at all times and under all  circumstances,    We remain, your Brethren in Christ    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon   Jos. F. Smith    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.    P.S.—We send you a number of extra copies of this circular for  distribution among the Bishops and Presidents of Quorums in your  Stake." 
 Utah will not longer need to journey afar in search of professional instruction;  but that our own State will offer her sons and daughters ample facilities in  all departments of intellectual progress.    We recommend to the Latter-day Saints that they faithfully devote their in-  fluence and energy, such as might have been claimed by the University of the   Church, had wisdom dictated the continuance of that institution, to the University  of Utah.    We trust that our people will sustain the Territorial University by  their good words and works, and particularly by their patronage in sending thither  their sons and daughters who are prepared to become students in the institution,  which by law is constituted as the head of the public school system of Utah.    The officers of the University are men in whom the people have learned to  repose their confidence; the Chancellor and the Regents need no encomiums  from us in their responsible and honorable stations. The President and  Faculty of the institution are severally of recognized abilities in their professions,  and of steadfast devotion to the educational advancement of the people; they are  entitled to the fullest confidence of Utah's citizens without distinction.    We feel assured that the moral influence of the University will prove of salu-  tary effect, and all due attention will be paid to the training of students in the  studies of true moral citizenship as well as in the subjects of purely secular  instruction.    However, as the University is a public possession, the propriety  of people of many sects and creeds, it would be manifestly improper to allow  any species of sectarian religious instruction to be imparted within its walls,  or under its auspices.    In view of these facts, and knowing, as we do, that many  of the Latter-day Saints are imbued with a strong desire to have their youth  instructed in theological tenets co-ordinately with secular training, we call your atten-  tion to the fact that the Latter-day Saints' College, an institution which stands  among the foremost of our Church Schools, is conducted in close proximity to the  University, and that the very full courses of daily instruction in Theology  will be offered at such hours, and under such conditions, that Latter-day Saint  students who are attending the University, and others not regularly attending  the College, may pursue in the latter such of these sacred studies as their  ability and opportunities will permit. It is the aim of our local and gener-  al educational boards to strengthen the theological department of the College, increas-  ing and augmenting the courses, to meet all requirements.    We request that the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops of Wards, and other  presiding officers, will cause this letter to be read in their places of public  gathering; and that they will use their influence in otherwise bringing this  subject before the people.    Respectfully your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F Smith    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. 
 members of the ward, at the Fast Meeting, or the Monthly Priesthood Meeting?    It was the mind of the Council that the regulation of confessions in such  cases should be left to the Bishopric of the Ward in which the wrong-doing  occurs; and that each case be considered on its merits, and disposed of  according to the publicity which has been given to it. For instance, where  people guilty of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their trans-  gression is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public.  But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made before  the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood meeting; or, if it  be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a still more public confession should  be made, it shall mean that the confession shall be made at the monthly  Fast Meeting (which meetings are attended almost, if not, exclusively by  church members) and that in no case shall confessions be made at the  regular Sunday services.    The object of this restriction is to confine the confession as much  as possible to the circle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and to avoid  spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation, which says  (Doc & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in a meeting, and  that not before the world."    As a rule, therefore, where the knowledge of transgression is known  to but a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at  the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has become  a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more public  confession be made.    We are    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo Q. Cannon  Jos F. Smith." 
 in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.    In Salt Lake City, instead of the people meeting in the Taberna-  cle on the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that   it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for   the Latter-day Saints to meet in their several wards on that after-  noon, so as to give all the members of the ward, including the aged   and infirm, and others who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an   opportunity to participate in the fast meeting and share in the   blessings of the occasion. In other Stakes where general meetings  are held as in this city, we suggest that they also be dispensed with   on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meet in their   places of worship in the several wards.    In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast   to omit eating breakfast. This is not in accordance with the views  and practice of the past. When fasts were observed in the early days,  it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until af-  ter the meeting in the afternoon of the fast day. In making donations   to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that would  be necessary for the two meals should be donated to the poor, and as   much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the means  may feel disposed to give.    In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all  the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or   in foreign lands. We think this arrangement will suit the convenience   and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and   we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church  in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and  the time be understood by all.    Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there  should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these   meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions and  troubles before the Lord. By approaching Him in the spirit of humil-  ity and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or evils  from the individuals or from the people. Our past experience has proved   to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the hours of   extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and   with proper faith. He is quick to hear the cries of His people, and He has prom-  ised us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us. Such  occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advantage of by the afflicted,  whether in an individual or in a collective capacity    With constant prayers for your welfare and happiness and the prosperity  of the work of God,    We are your brethren,    Wilford Woodruff,  George Q. Cannon,  Joseph F. Smith.    First Presidency. 
 Feeling the necessity of a correct understanding of this principle,  we deem it proper at this sixty-sixth anniversary of the organization of  the Church, in these last days, to prepare and present a statement on  the subject, embodying the doctrine which has always prevailed in   the Church, and our views upon it. We are prompted to adopt this  course at the present time because of events which have happened  during the late political contest. A great diversity of opinion on the subject   has been expressed, and even by leading Elders in the Church, which latter fact  has naturally led in some instances to considerable division of sentiment.    It is of great importance that we understand each other and that there be  harmony in our teachings. It is especially important that these teachings  shall be in accordance with the rules and doctrines which have been  taught and which have prevailed from the beginning until the present  time, having not only the sanction of undisputed usage, but the approval  of all faithful leaders in the Church and of Him in whose name and by   whose authority they act.    In the late exciting contest, to which reference has been made, the pres-  iding authorities in some instances have been misunderstood. In other   instances they have been misrepresented, which has led to a wrongful  conseption of their real views. It has been asserted too freely, and without  foundation, that there has been a disposition on their part to interfere  with individual liberty and to rebuke in some men a course which   was applauded in others. In a word, that they have appeared to desire to   assert and maintain an unjust and oppressive control over the actions  of the members of the Church, and in thus doing have endeavored to   effect a union of Church and State. In the heat of political discus-  sion, assertions have been made and arguments used conveying to the   public mind a false idea concerning the position of the officers of the Church,   and leaving the impression that there has been and was now being made  an attempt to accomplish the union above referred to. Now that the   excitement has passed, and calmer reason has resumed its sway,  we think it prudent to set forth, so that all may understand, the exact  position occupied by the leading authorities of the Church.    In the first place we wish to state in the most positive and empha-  tic language that at no time has there ever been any attempt or even   desire on the part of the leading authoritities referred to to have the  Church in any manner encroach upon the rights of the State, or to   unite in any degree the functions of the one with those of the other.    Peculiar circumstances have surrouned the people of Utah. For   many years a majority of them in every portion of the Territory belonged   to one Church, every reputable member of which was entitled to hold  and did hold some ecclesiastical office. It is easy to see how, to the   casual observer, it might appear singular that so many officers of   the Church were also officers of the State; but while this was in   fact the case, the distinction between the Church and the State  throughout those years was carefully maintained. The President 
 Oct 2 [18]88  Richard W. Young.  Salt Lake City.  Oct 10 [18]88  attended to  file 
 of the Church held for eight years the highest civil office in the com-  munity, having been appointed by the national administration   governor of the Territory. The first secretary of the Territory was   a prominent Church official. An Apostle represented the Territory   in Congress as a delegate during ten years. The members of the   Legislature held also offices in the Church. This was unavoidable;  for the most suitable men were elected by the votes of the people,  and, as we have stated, every reputable man in the entire commun-  ity held some Church position, the most energetic and capable hold-  ing leading positions. This is all natural and plain enough to   those who consider the circumstances; but it furnished opportunity   for those who were disposed to assail the people of the Territory to   charge them with attempting to unite Church and State. A fair  investigation of the conditions will abundantly disprove the   charge and show its utter falsity.    On behalf of the Church of which we are leading officers, we desire   again to state to the members and also to the public generally, that   there has not been, nor is there, the remotest desire on our part or on   the part of our co-religionists to do anything looking to a union  of Church and State.    We declare that there has never been any attempt to curtail in-  dividual liberty of any of the officers or members of the Church. The   First Presidency and other leading officers did make certain sugges-  tions to the people when the division on party lines took place. That  movement was an entirely new departure, and it was necessary, in   order that the full benefit should not be lost which was hoped to   result from this new political division, that people who were inexperi-  enced should be warned against hasty and ill-considered action. In   some cases they were counseled to be wise and prudent in the political  step's they were about to take, and this with no idea of winning them againts   their will to either side.    To this extent, and no further, was anything said   or done upon this question, and at no time and under no circumstances   was any attempt made to say to voters how they should cast their ballots.  Any charge that has been made to the contrary is utterly false.    Concerning officers of the Church themselves, the feeling was generally   expressed in the beginning of the political division spoken of that it would  be prudent for leading men not to accept of office at the hands of the politi-  cal party to which they might belong. This counsel was given to men of   both parties alike—not because it was thought that there was any im-  propriety in religious men holding civil office, not to deprive them   of any of the rights of citizenship, but because of the feeling that it  would be better under the circumstances which had now arisen   to avoid any action that would be likely to create jealousy and ill-  feeling. A era of peace and good-will seemed to be dawning upon   the people, and it was deemed good to shun everything that could have  the least tendency to prevent the consummation of this happy prospect. 
 In many instances, however, the pressure brought to bear upon efficient   and popular men by the members of the parties to which they belonged was   of such a character that they had to yield to the solicitation to accept nom-  ination to office, or subject themselves to the suspicion of bad faith in their   party affiliations. In some cases they did this without consulting the   authorities of the Church; but where important positions were held, and  where the duties were of a responsible and exacting character, some did  seek the counsel and advice of the leading Church authorities before accept-  ing the political honors tendered them. Because some others did not   seek this counsel and advice, ill-feeling was engendered, and undue and   painful sensitiveness was stimulated; misunderstanding readily followed,  and as a result the authorities of the Church were accused of bad faith   and made the subjects of bitter reproach. We have maintained that   in the case of men who hold high positions in the Church, whose duties   are well defined, and whose ecclesiastical labors are understood to be   continuous and necessary, it would be an improper thing to accept politi-  cal office or enter into any vocation that would distract or remove them   from the religious duties resting upon them, without first consulting   and obtaining the approval of their associates and those who preside over   them. It has been understood from the very beginning of the Church   that no officer whose duties are of the character referred to, has the  right to engage in any pursuit, political or otherwise, that will   divide his time and remove his attention from the calling already   accepted. It has been the constant practice with officers of the Church  to consult—or, to use our language, to "counsel"—with their brethren  concerning all questions of this kind. They have not felt that they   were sacrificing their manhood in doing so, nor that they were   submitting to improper dictation, nor that in soliciting and acting  upon the advise of those over them, they were in any manner doing  away with their individual rights and agency, nor that to any im-  proper degree were their rights and duties as American citizens   being abridged or interferred with. They realized that in accept-  ing ecclesiastical office they assumed certain obligations; that among  these was the obligation to magnify the office which they held, to   attend to its duties in preference to every other labor, and to devote them-  selves exclusively to it with all the zeal, industry and strength they   possessed, unless released in part or for a time by those who preside  over them. Our view, and it has been the view of all our predeces-  sors, is that no officer of our Church, especially those in high standing,   should take a course to violate this long established practice. Rather   than disobey it, and declare himself by his actions defiantly independ-  ent of his associates and his file leaders, it has always been held  that it would be better for a man to resign the duties of his Priesthood;  and we entertain the same view to-day.    In view of all the occurrencies to which reference has been made, and   to the diversity of views that have arisen among the people in consequence, 
 We feel it to be our duty to clearly define our position, so there may be   no cause hereafter for dispute or controversy upon the subject:    First—We unanimously agree to and promulgate as a rule that   should always be observed in the Church and by every leading official  thereof, that before accepting any position, political or otherwise, which   would interfere with the proper and complete discharge of his ecclesi-  astical duties, and before accepting a nomination or entering into   engagements to perform new duties, said official should apply to the   proper authorities and learn from them whether he can, consistently with   the obligations already entered into with the Church upon assuming his  office, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibili-  ties of the new position. To maintain proper discipline and order   in the Church, we deem this absolutely necessary; and in asserting   this rule, we do not consider that we are infringing in the least de-  gree upon the individual rights of the citizen. Our position is that   a man having accepted the honors and obligations of ecclesiastical  office in the Church cannot properly of his own volition make   those honors subordinate to or even co-ordinate with new ones of an   entirely different character; we hold that unless he is willing to counsel  with and obtain the consent of his fellow-laborers and presiding officers  in the Priesthood, he should be released from all obligations associated  with the latter, before accepting any new position.    Second—We declare that in making these requirements of   ourselves and our brethren in the ministry, we do not in the least  desire to dictate to them concerning their duties as American citi-  zens, or to interfere with the affairs of the State; neither do we consider  that in the remotest degree we are seeking the union of Church and  State.    We once more here repudiate the insinuation that there  is or ever has been an attempt by our leading men to trespass upon   the ground occupied by the State, or that there has been or is the wish to   curtail in any manner any of its functions.

 38 Quince Street  Salt Lake City  Oct 25th 1887    President Wilford Woodruff and  Council of the Apostles    Dear Brethern:    Having been informed that the al-  lowance received by the late President John  Taylor, ceased at the time he took up his  residence at the Gardo House, and that in  lieu thereof an arrangement was made  by which the church assumed the family  expenses, including taxes &c. and    Being now in receipt of notices  for the tax year ending, Oct 31, 1887 also  a bill from Dr Anderson for: professional  services during Presidents Taylor's last  illness,    We are in doubt as to wheather it   is incumbent upon us to pay these bills  or wheather, as heretofore they should be, 
 O. F. Atwood  Hooperville  Oct. 3 [18]87.    Hooperville, Sep 29th 1887    Elder Wilford Woodruff    Dear Sir In  searching the Book of Doctrine and Covenants  I find a revelateaion wherein the Lord says, Behold  verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received  a commandment for a law unto my church  through him whom I have appointed unto you  to receive revelations and commandments from  my hand. But verily, verily, I say unto you,  that none else shall be appointed unto this gift,  except it be through him, for if it be taken from  him, he shall not have power except to appoint  another in his stead. And this shall be a law  unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of  any that shall come before you as revelations or  commandments. And this I give unto you  that you may not be deceived, that you may 
 as heretofore assumed by the church.    We respectfully submit the matter  to you for your consideration, and will  cheerfully endorse any decision you  may arrive at in the premises.    Before closing this letter, permit us  in behalf of the family to express our  thanks for the prompt and generous ^manner^ which  characterized the funeral arrangements  of the late President John Taylor  and for the liberal expenditure of means  and labor devoted to the construction  of ^the^ Granite Sarcophagus enclosing  his remains.    In regard to Trust property,  should there be any, now  remaining in the name  of President John Taylor  as Trustee in Trust for the  Church of Jesus Christ of 
 know they are not of me. This is very plain,  and this law is in force to day upon the church  as much as it was in the day it was given.    And it is the imperative duty of every member  in this church to know that another has been  appointed unto this gift through the Prophet  Joseph Smith, or according to this law, we must  reject the message, or great will be the condemnation  of this people. This brings us to the great and important  question, Did the Prophet Joseph Smith confer this  gift upon another? There is an order in this church  that every man can show his authority, and the  office to which he has been appointed. It is by the  laying on of hands by one halding holding the author-  ity. Every person in this church that claims  authority must be able to show how he received it.  The Prophet Joseph Smith plainly showed and  proved by witnesses his right to what he claimed.    Now every person in this church should be able to   answer this question, Did the Prophet Joseph Smith  lay his hands upon another and bestow this gift  upon him? In this we must not be mistaken. 
 Latter-day Saints, we would  take pleasure, at any time; in  transferring the same to an[y]  whomsoever you may designate    Trusting we shall be  favored with an answer at  your earliest convenience and  praying for your continual  welfare we remain.    Yours very respectfully    George J. Taylor  John W. Taylor    Executors of the Estate of  President John Taylor Deceased. 
 The welfare of this church depends upon a knowledge  of this. In another revelation it says. But, behold,  verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be  appointed to receive commandments and revelations  in this church, excepting my servant Joseph  Smith, jun, for he receiveth them even as Moses.  We all know that Moses received commandments  and revelations for a law to guide and govern all  Israel until Christ come in the flesh. The people  knew that Moses talked with the Lord, and they  knew that his word was the word of the Lord therefore  they must be obedient to it. We can see by reading  the ##Numbers 27:18-23|27th chap of Numbers## how the Lord dealt with  the people, that they might not be deceived. Before  Moses went away the Lord said to him. Take thee  Joshua the son of Nun, as man in whom is the spirit  and lay thine hand upon him, And set him before  Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation  and give him a charge in their sight. And then  shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the  congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.  And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a  charge as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, 
 Geo. J. Taylor  John W. Taylor  25 Oct. 1887 
 I will say here that the Priesthood which Moses  received under the hand of his father-in-law Jethro  and Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb  and so back to Esaias who received it under the hand  of God. This is the High Priesthood which is the  greatest of all. [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:6-7##] Moses confered this branch of the  Holy Priesthood upon the Prophet Joseph Smith  which is for the gathering of Israel, the establishment  of Zion, and the building of holy temples, and   leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north. [##Doctrine and Covenants 110:11##]  All other branches of the Priesthood are appenda-  ges to this. The High Priesthood is a local office,  to take charge of the affairs of Zion and her stakes  to be assisted by the lesser Priesthood to see that  that her laws are kept which will sanctify the  people and prepare them to redeem Zion. Then  the Twelve and Seventies are a travelling ministry  to preach the gospel in all the world. The Twelve  Apostles holds the keys of this ministry. This is 
 plainly written in the Book of Doctrine and Cov-  enants, and it also agrees with a decision of the  Prophet Joseph Smith, at a grand Council held  in Kirtland May 2nd 1835 which says that President   Joseph Smith then stated, That the Twelve will  have no right to go into Zion or any of her  stakes and there undertake to regulate the affairs  thereof, where there is a standing High Council  but it is their duty to go abroad and regulate  all matters relative to the different branches of  the church. No standing High Council has  authority to go into the churches abroad and   regulate the matters thereof for this belongs to the  Twelve. Showing their two distinct fields of  labor, and the specific duties belonging to each  branch of the Priesthood. There should be great  weight placed upon all the decisions of the Prophet  Joseph, for the Lord says He has inspired him  to lay the foundation of this church and to build  it up unto the most holy faith. And the Lord also 
 says, Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt   give heed unto all his words and commandments  which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them  walking in all holiness before me, For his word  ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in   all patience and faith; For by doing these things  the gates of hell shall not prevail against you,  yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers  of darkness from before you, and ^cause^ the heavens to  shake for your good and His name's glory.    We can see that the blessings of the Lord depends  upon our obedience to the word of the Lord revealed   through Joseph Smith. How essential it is that we  search this great law and that it is taught to the people  and that this church is set in order according to the  revelations and commandments which we have received.    The reason I have for writing this letter to you is because  of the anxiety I have for the welfare of this people. I  have written with the earnest feelings of my heart in the fear of  the Lord knowing that what I have written is true. Now as the  Twelve again take the responsibility as leaders of the church, you  should answer intelligently to the church, how and by what means  you claim this great honor? Yours as ever Orville F Atwood 
 52 Ironmonger Row, Saint Lukes, London. Nov. 7th  Nov 13th 1840    Elder D Browett    Beloved Brother   I sit down in  company with Brother Pitt this morning to address  another letter to you. I am sorry that I have made  my frinds, so much trouble in their rendering me  assistance. I wrote you a letter in the first place   making mention of the situation of things here & our  circumstances &c. & I waited a long time & had   no reply finally I had a letter from Elder Kington   informing me that you had Mailed a letter to   me at Chettenhan containing £2 which letter   I never got & as soon as I obtained this infor-  mation I went to the general post office in London  & made inquiry concerning it & am searching their   Books & Way Bills they found the Letter had never   reachd London & they have taken the matter in hand   & are tring to trace it out. I also sat down &   wrote you a letter concerning it, & I want you   to write me a letter & tell me If you got the   last letter which I wrote. I requested you in that   letter to inform me, who wrote & signed the letter   containing the money & the date of it & who carried it to   the post office & was it entered as a money letter   &c. I wish you would write me a letter & tell me   all about this & would it not be well for you   to see the post Master in Chettenham & enquire   about it &c. I informed you in my last  letter that the ownly safe way was to get a 
 Post office order, that is have the money carried to   the post office & paid & a printed order is given which   can be indorsed in a letter & then I could carriey it   to the general post office & they pay me the mony   for it. I received A Letter from John Cheese   containing An order of this kind of £2.10. I also   receeved a letter from Samuel Jones with £1 so  there were towo pounds lost. all money conveyed   in post office order is perfectly safe our friends   have been vary kind to me & they shall not   loose their reward. Brother Pitt is with me & will   tarry over the Sabbath. I shall probably call into   your region of country & see you all after awhile  I expect Elders Young & Kimball are on there way to   Londo & I expect they will visit you on the way Elder   BRichards & his Brother is expecting to visit your region   in about a week ot towo. There has a number of the Brother  lately arived from America. one is going to Wales one to   Glasgow one to Birmingham &c.

Elder Smith has gone to Birmingham   & the potteries to spend the a season with the Saints there    Dear Brothers & Sisters let us not be discouraged   in the good cause of God, for the vary persecution   We are receiving ownly goes to proove the reality of 
 of the truth that we have received for no   man can live Godly in Christ Jesus & not  suffer persecution & there is nothing that will make   the wicked mad as soon as the truth I rejoice   my friends in the anticipation of enjoying a   celestial glory with you in that kingdom where   the wicked will cease from troubling & the weary   are at rest & may God part that this may   be the case with us all for which I will  ever pray    W.

 Scarborough Maine May 3rd 1838    Hon parents    I sit down this morning in company with Phebe  & Mother Carter for the purpose of addressing a few lines to you. I  have just written a letter to Brother Asahel one object I have in view  in writing at this time is to inform you of my present calculations &   intentions. A person situated as I am in life & calling Does not at   all times know what a day or a month will bring forth or where they may   be called to stand in defence of the truth. I held two conferences   the middle of April upon fox Island & organized a Church upon each of   the Islands & left them in a situation to attend to their meetings while I   am absent the two Churches number about 50 members being the fruits  of my labour during the past season & in consequence of recieving   some intelligence from Elder Parley P. Pratt now preaching in the City of   New York. I have left the Islands for the purpose of visiting that City & am   now at Father Carters house Phebe has spent the winter with me upon the   Islands she returned home by water the 20th of April at that time I expected to have   spent the Summer upon the Islands but on recieving intelliegence from NY. I   left the Islands on the 28 of April & returned to father Carters in company with Elder  Milton Holmes on the 1st of May I intend to persue my journey on Monday I am expect-  ing to visit Lynn, Boston, Holiston & the City of NY, as the work of God is pro-  gressing in those places & it is my present calculation to visit you in conn-  ectcut either going or on my return I felt last season that an opportunity would   offer for me to visit you again & I now feel as though that time is nigh. I am   expecting to lead a company of Saints from the Islands to the City far West Mo  next September I expect Phebe will accompany me to Missouri if her circumstances   will admit which I trust will be the case. She would be glad to visit you this season  but I suppose will not be able to. She sends her respects to you & Sister Eunice &   all who inquire. I was highly edifyed with the reading of your last letter should   you write to me again please direct to Scarborough Maine as Phebe will

You spoke of our paper  the Elder's Journal I wrote to the Editor to forward the papers to you but as you  did not recieve them I forwarded my two first numbers to you  which will be all that any of us will obtain at present for the printing Office  has been burned to the ground with all of its contents it is supposed to have ben  set on fire by whom is unknown consequently their will the no more printed  untill the press is set up in Missouri when I expect will be before long  the work of the Lord is progressing rapidly whareever it is proclaimed this  season & there never has been mor efforts made against it as the  present season some few fals brethren who have made shipwreck of faith  are joined with the world in opposing the Church & our principles but it is   all to no affect they cannot cause the scriptures to the brocken neither can  they stop the work of God. The work of God has finally taken a strong hold  in the City of NY. Elder Pratt writes that 75 have been added to the church  in the City & that the work has but just begun I am now Baptizing day  & night we have two meeting houses that we occupy & we preach every   Sunday in Tamany Hall the most noted Hall in the City we are crowded beyond  conception some people come 20 or 30 miles to hear & obey the gospel. as to opposition  the City is in a general uproar in many parts. The priests rage & foam & many   of them go to such length that every honest man is driven to the necessity of com-  ing out from them. Many newspapers & two pamphlets are filled against us I  have replyed to Mr Sunderlands peices in the Zions Watchman in a  pamphlet of 42 pages which I wish to be circulated wharever that paper  has gone. Visions, Tongues, prophesying, & healings are manifest in this City the  desiples are firm in the faith in this place & are ready to suffer death for  Christ sake & the truth, there is more calls in the City as well as con-  ntry than we can possibly attend to. These with many other good things Brother  Pratt says in this letter. So I am now on my way to visit him a short time  I shall calculate to call at Farmington in May or June if the Lord will &  pay you a visit. I think you said in your letter that Uncle Ozem & 
 Sunday Morning, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio, May 7th 1837.    Aphek & Azubah Woodruff,    Dear Parents    While the Sun is  sheding his brilliant rays to gladden earth, & the Saints thronging the streets of  Kirtland on their way to worship in the Temple of the Lord I avail myself  of the opportunity (in company with my wife) of spending a few leasure moments  of again addressing you with my pen. I said in company with my  wife. I am sensible that a remark of this kind from my pen is unexpected  & unlooked for by you unless the paper bearing the account of my marriage  th hath fallen into your hands be that as it may suffice it to say that  I was married on the 13th of April 1837, to Miss Phebe W. Carter,  from the State of Maine. I was married at the house of Joseph Smith jun   in Kirtland the ceremony solemnized by F. G. Williams, Esq. My wife is a  tayloress by trade which occupation she has closly followed for the last seven years  her time for several seasons previous was spent in teaching school. We  are both of us old enough to be wise their is as many days differance in our ages  as God was making the heavens & the Earth. I was born March 1st  1807, my wife   was born March 8th 1807 making her 7 days the youngest. Perhaps you may wonder  at my taking upon me the marriage covenant considering my calling  in life I should not have taken such a step had I not been fully  convinced it was the will of God neither will it (or some might suppose)  ever hinder me from cleaning my garments of the blood of this generation  or finishing my mission to Jew or gentile. My wife is enjoying  good health peace, & contentment, & sends her respects to you who  have become her parents by law although strangers unto her she  wishes to be remembered to sister Eunice. She has a desire to visit you all  which I trust may yet be the case. I am enjoying good  health which hath ever been the case since I left you. I have  not herd from any of you for a long time. I have written to you  & several of my relatives since I returned to Kirtland but have  not received answers I received a letter from Brother Asahel  AsDated Dec 16th1836 Terre Haute he wished to corresspond with me  I wrote him two letters since but received no answer perhaps he did  not receive them I wrote a letter to Brother Azmon also but herd  nothing from him since you wrote to me in Tennessee I  have spent the winter in school but am expecting to spend the summer  in the vineyard of the Lord The route which I expect to take this season  (unless some unforeseen circumstance should change it) is as follows one  week from monday I expect to take water on lake Erie for black River country

 to attend a conference in Jefferson County N Y. about a days walk  from Brother Azmons in Richland this will be the first week in June  I expect to visit Brothers A & Y Woodruff before I leave Richland  from thence I expect to proced immediately to Connecticut & shall probably  visit you the last of June of or first of July.  I expect to spend two or  three months in Connecticut during the season I shall endeavor to  visit my relatives in the East universally this season if the Lord will from  Connecticut I expect to visit the the State of Maine & attend a con-  ference there.  I expect to visit my wifes relatives in Maine whare I  expect to meet Mrs. Woodruff who is expecting to accompany some friends to that  state & will spend the time with her parents & friends untill I arive  We may then return to Kirtland by way of Connecticut & visit you  together this is what I desire to do if nothing hinders. I have long desired  to visit you & the rest of my relatives in the east & I trust that God  may open my way before me this season that I may have the desires of  my heart in this thing that I may speak & answer for myself in all  things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. my motive would not be seeking  for honour in my own country for I should not expect to obtain it for if a  prophet could not find honour in his own country how could a Teacher expect  it, yet I feel for my kindred those bound to me by the ties of consangu-  inity I desire to proclaim unto them the words of Eternal the greatest  gift of God & warn them of things as they are in these last days that my  garments may be clean of their blood & the blood of all men leaving the event  with God that peradventure I may be an instrument in the hands of God  of bringing some of my relatives into the New & everlasting covenant I  know not but it may be the last mission among my kindred that I   shall be privileged with therefore I pray God to grant me success this once  Time flies. the gentiles are ripe in iniquity & prepared for judgment.

 aunt Hannah was at your house give my respects to them & to all enquiring  friends I was sorry to hear of Aunt Hannah's Ill health I am in hopes she will  again be restored in body & mind. You will notice in the papers I sent you  that the work of the Lord has commenced in England & I learn from late  letters that it is progressing with speed. I view an important day at hand  even the day of the gathering of Israel & bloody wars & other judgments  upon the gentiles The Lord is about to take peace from the earth & there  hath already a lying spirit gone forth among men to stir them up to  anger one against another The signs in the heavens & Earth all indi-  cate the near approach of the Son of God greater darkness never covered  Egypt than now covers the professed Christian world they neither believe  in nor are looking for the timr & literal fulfillment of the word of God con-  sequently it will over take them as a thief in the night. Had we the tongue of Angels  & the zeal of Apostles, possessing the intelligence of heaven, with our hearts expanding  wide as eternity, & our bosoms burning with the love of God & commissioned  to bear as glad tidings as was ever [borne] by Michael the Ark Angel. It would  be as much impossible to fill our mission & deliver our message in a manner to  be recieved & approbated by the majority of this generation, as it was for ST Paul  while at Ephesus declairing glad tidings of a Crusified & risen redeemer, while his  voice was lost amid the day of the Ephesians that great is the goddess Diana. [##Acts 19:23-41##] I have  a great anxiety for the spiritual well fare of my relatives & that they may be prepared  for the unparalled judgments, & august events that are rolling upon the heads  of this generation. I wished to be remembered to Sister Eunice I suppose she  is either teaching or attending school. I learn that Brother Asahel & Mr Smith  have dissolved pardonsip [partnership] & that Asahel attends to his Book business alone  I have had some interesting & satisfactory letters from Asahel during the past  winter I am in hopes his mind will yet incline to the things of God. I want  an interest in all of your prayers I remember you all before a throne of Grace  May the peace of God abide with you all & lead you into all truth for Christ Sake    Aphek & Azubath Woodruff From your Son  Willford Woodruff 
 to bear the sound of the gospel & be warned that the hour of judgment  may come. I expect soon to be called to accompany my brethren  to that land perhaps by the opening of another spring thes things may  appear as idle tales to thousands & perhaps to my kindred but when  horid famine desolates the east & every man's sword raised against his nei  ghbour through the land while all law is but a mame & pestilence wastes the  harts of men Earthquakes & horible tempest desolates cities & villages. the  reflecting mind of none others during the fulfillment of thes things will begin to  believe that there is a gGod in Israel who reveals himself in these last days  & that He hath a prophet in the land. I desire the temporal  & spiritual welfare of all my friends I would not lead or wish to see  them led into any error or evil I expect they will all act as agents for  themselfes I expect to do the same I have peculiar feelings for them  all I marvel at the great events of these last days that have & are  transpiring I view a special hand of God in dealing with me through life  I am experiencing the fulfillment of many of my former impression  which were dictated by the spirit of truth. I receieved the gospel of Jesus Christ  as proclaimed by the Latter Day Saints the first time I herd it from that day  to the present I have no doubts upon the subjects yea I know it  to be the work of God & although the gentiles rage the prests imagine thousands  vain things a flood of evil epithets & falshoods heaped upon our heads & perils,  of fals brethers & some dishonor the Holy priesthood & their anointing by  breaking the commandments of God & acting wickedly I say notwithstanding  all these things the work of God still rolls on in this place & all places whare  the word is faithfully preached the stone rolls the kingdom grows there  has seldom a sabbath passed by us since I have been in Kirtland  but what numbers have been added to the church the work is still  progressing with rapidity in the English dominions & all places whare  it is proclaimed. Latest accounts from Missouri said it was a time of  health great plenty & prosperity & universal peace with all men the Saints  have settled a county by themselves at present they are still constantly  gathering, with prosperity their will be a large city there in Kirtland soon  as the saints are building fast. But I must draw to a close give  my respects to all enquiring friends I wish to be remembered to sister  Eunice you may look for me during the season, if the  Lord will I shall endeavour to visit you. I pray God to give us  all wisdom light & truth that we may escape the dangers of this perilous  generation which is the prayer of your Son  Wilford Woodruff    Aphek & Azubeh Woodruff

 Simsbury April 27th 1845    Respected Cousin,  With feelings of gratitude I take my pen in to acknowledge the  receipt of a few lines from you on this the 27th of April directed to me & addressed to "my friend."    I aem much rejoiced to hear from you & your family that you are all alive in the land  of the living & enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. and, it is with pleasure that I embrace  the opportunity of answering your letter, ecp^ect^ing to be able to give you some information,   which you earnestly desire & which may be some consolation while far away in a distant  land. I have both good & bad news to communicate, but nothing so bad as I think you  have apprehended. We your friends are all alive, some enjoying comfortable health while  others still partake of the cup of affliction, with many comforts mingled. I will give you an  account of each & any one agreeable to your request, inasmuch as I have received intelli-  gence myself. I will commence with our family who are among the number of the afflicted    There has been no very material change with us. Mother remains about the same if any   differance in her situation it is for the worse—It appears to me that her ease is a peculiar one.  she seems to have all reason & yet no reason, knows evry^thing^ & knows nothing. I do not know what  to think about her, sometimes I have a good degree of confidence to believe that she will recover  & sometimes I doubt, at all times I place much dependance on the faith of my friends. If it can be  consistant will the will of God & his purposes concerning us. I earnestly desire that my mother may be  restored to health & to the right use of her reason. If such a blessing is ever mine know assur^e^dly  that I am happy. My health is about the same as when I wrote. Sister Ann is about par  with me she has been much afflicted during the past winter with a nervous tooth-ache which  has reduced her strength very much, but we have been ennabled by the help of God to bear  all that has been laid upon us & are still able to do our necessary housework, but I think my  health has been poorer since you left than ever before, as has been the case with Sister Ann. Brother  Cyrus is well & doing well. I have not seen Aunt Bulah since late in the fall, but understand her  health has been poor through the winter. we are expecting her here daily. I have heard nothing  particular from Uncle Ozem's family, they are living in Lovely street, & I conclude well. I have learned  by the bye that Mr Herd is dead, no other connexions. I have had somwhat recent intelligence ^both^ from  Richland & Nauvoo, by way of a letter from Aunt Woodruff your Mother, directed to us & dated March 30  from which I will make some extracts, by so doing give you all the information I am in possession of respecting  those distant friends. "We have been some disappointed in our earthly expectations  the year past but tho we were some cast down for a time yet we have not been forsaken, we have enjoyed  ourselves notwithstanding as well as formerly, we have a plenty of house room tolerably convenient & enough  to eat & drink & we have been favored with having good news from our children at Nauvoo. We received a letter short time  since under Date of Feb 9th & March 16th. the greatest part being dictated by Eunice. Mr Webster being scribe & addressed 
 to Mother, she writes that as to her health it had not been as well since they last wrote (being then able to do  some light work) untill a week past the circumstances of which she says she will mention. Mr. Webster having joined the  Carriage & Coach association came home one night from his buisness & said that Brother Roberts (the one who kicked  up such a bobery in New York by an evil spirit getting hold of him) said to him in view of his being detained from his work  by sickness in his family that if he would come down next Monday he would prophecy in the name of the Lord that he &  his wife would both get well, that she was rather disposed to make light of it as she thought him to be possessed of rather an  aspiring mind that on account of her former prejudices & prepositions thought probable he spok in his own name  instead of by the power of the Priesthood. I said to Br Frost a member of the association a few nights after words Br. R. is going  to have us healed right off he said Roberts had a good spirit that night. I can tell when he has a right spirit, I believe he  did speak in the name of the Lord. this she says set me a thinking for I knew frost was on the Look out for him as well as we, the  next week on Sunday she says which was a week ago to day some one rapped at the door & I was introduced to Br Roberts. Among  other things he enquired about my health & said he thought if I would have a little more faith I could get well, I told him if  I had a great deal I thought I might, told him she had had quite a spirit of labor for her health 2 or 3 days past more so  than usual, he said that might be accounted for, that the Brethren fo the associaton had been praying for her, she says her  prejudice began to wear away & said to him is your mind led to pray for me, would it be led to administer to me at my  request, that he accordingly did so, & it was evident that he had the spirit of the Lord, his prayer being very appropriate to her  case, he pronounced the blessing of health upon me & said I should begin from that time to gain &c that he told her afterwards if  she would begin to excercise, be sure & do enough be carful & not do too much, he would promise her she should soon be better, this  was the substance of the matter & she found his words to prove true, she went to work the next day & had been quite smart through  the week washing dishes cooking & c she then writes under date March 16th about five weeks from the commencement of her letter  & says she has the took a good deal aside from that she is quite smart, says Dwight goes to his work after breakfast & she gets along through  the day with the chores & gets supper ready against he gets home. I am rejoiced to learn that there is so good a prospect of E's getting  her health. she says (in referance to my informing her that we had received a letter from Azmon giving his Father an  invitation to go & live by or near them &c) she says give my love to him & tell him as bad as the Mormans be I would not be dep-  rived of being with the body of the saints on any account whatever & then adds, I have much I would like to say upon principle  but cannot do it by letter, prepare yourselves for great things prepare yourselves for great doctrine, prepare yourselves for becoming  rid of many tradisions. I had tradition when I came to Nauvoo, which I am trying hard to get rid of the fact is she says  the laws of the Celestial Kingdom are such that but few of even the siants will be able to abide them, but my faith is not  shaken at all in the work. I have been deprived of the privilege of going to meeting yet notwithstanding I have learned  many things which I could not have learned in public. this from Willford's family, now from Brother Page's one of the twelve  who lives in the house with us, only a door separates us, they are fine family. they have a young woman boarding with them  who came from Boston last fall, her Mother is a rich widow woman worth about 15000 she sacrificed friends & property.    Mr Webster has joined the Carriage & Coach association, which they think will help them to get a comfortable living for their family  I have just referred above to the invitation we received not long since from Azmon to live with him or by him, he wrote  very affectionately & gave us a handsome invitation to go there, thought his father could have a plenty of work if he  wished in his saw mill & shingle mill which he designs to get in operation by June but wishes us to act in accordance  with out own feelings on the subject not wishing to urge us contrary to our minds, but thinks it would be our best way  to come over if we intended to go to Nauvoo some day, but we do not now think of going to Richland, we do not have a   letter yet Wilford which I think rather strange of" I was very glad to get the above information, wish I could see the letter  I intended to write to them ere long, if I can find myself composed enough. It is hard for me to write amidst so much confusion  & I cannot get away from it. I have received no other news from Nauvoo except what I occasionally get from the Prophet  dont you occasionally get that paper? If so you may be as well informed respecting Nauvoo & the prosperit of the caus  of God abroad as myself as it is through that medium I get nearly all the information I am in possession of. I should judge  from that paper things were going on tolerably well in general & that in many places the work is prospering much,  especially in Lowel, Mass New York, Newhaven Cities, Clinton Ct. & in other places the work is progressing. there was a   Branch of the church organized in Hartford last winter of 7 or 8 members, ^& more believing^ whether they have ben added to the church  since I do not know. All the information I have gained respecting the work there was from Brother Sparks, & Burnham  who visited us last winter. ^number times^ visited Farmington Avon & Weatouge but was not able to accomplish much on account  of the prejudice of the minds of the people. They made an appointment in Farmington, none attended but the  Saints. I think they preached once in Avon twice in Weatogue & once in Hopmeadow, the first in Weatogue  I could not attend, but went to the second I can assure you I as happy as a lark on my way & untill near  the close of the meeting when my joy was turned to distraction. There was a large congregation, some of the principal  ones left before the close of the sermon Perhaps becasue the speaker was lengthy; but while he was making his closing  remarks all of a sudden there was a stamping hooting laughing & all sorts of music. Br Sparks undertook to reason  with the leader, some conversation ensued rough enough too on the part of the enemy which consisted of the  school teacher & some of his scholars none very apt but himself soon the lights were blown out I was in a sorry  predicament nearly all had left but the mobbers & I knew not what to do as [blank] my Brother C. who accom-  panied he had retired unnoticed. I appreached the stand & enquired of Br Burnham what I should do, by this  time one light was blown up again by Br Sparks, Br B took it in one hand gave me the other & told me to follow  him. we went down stairs being saluted on the way found Brother Cyrus near the door waiting for me &  watching his horse, he left the meeting on account of feeling somewhat ill & found it necessary to remain with  or near his horse. So much for the prosperity of Mormonism in Weatogue I believe they will go to destruction by  wholesale. They behaved more respectfully in Hopmeadow Indeed they would scorn such things but the weath-  er was extremely cold & but few people attended. I have heard no fault found with any thing that was advanced   & no comments whatever except from 1 or 2 young people who observed that he was quite a talker I believe they was  somewhat confounded by the doctrines held forth but then he was noboddy but a Mormon. They visited us again &  proposed holding another meeting, applied for the better schoolhouse (a dwelling house occupied for school) 
 but was refused on the plea of [blank] [beining] no buisness to let it they would not accept of the old house on account  of its being so cold & uncomfortable, had we been well I would kept them preaching in our house as long as they would stay  whether any body attended or not (this last visit of which I have been speaking was the day they preached in Weatouge I have  neither seen or heard from these Brothers since, perhaps they have gone to Nauvoo if not Brother Sparks remains in Hartford  he removed his family there last fall. Respecting who has the care of other churches I do not know as there has been a  special call from the west for the Elders generally to repair to Nauvoo to spend the summer, working on the Temple &c  &c I expect those who could go have gone leaveing the care of branches with those who could not go. I rejoice that  Elder Pratt has taken the Presidency of the churches in this eastern land. I think much good will be the result.  I had forgotten to speak of Westfield & Windson I believe some have been added to the Churches there. I have greatly desired  that something might be done in this place. I think Brother Sparks would have made further effort had it not been for  expences I did all I could for him but could not do much for reasons which I will not name however we furnished them  with what they needed during their visits (or principally) excepting lodging that was procured at the public  house at their own expence & they was nearly destitute of means. I greatly desire to be in a situation to enter-  tain my bretheren especially those who are destitute, by so doing I should ^be^ comforted edified & benefitted.    Doubtless you have heard of the unconditional repeal of the Nauvoo Charter & also that the Temple has been  progressing rapidly. They are expecting to commence the endowment soon as the first of December next.  If Eunice enjoys health I think she will have a good time this Summer, she seems to value her privileges I could  ^[saih]^ I was there to share with her, how ^much^ should value the society of the saints no one can easily immagine, I think I could  fully appreciate such blessings. But although I am deprived of many Privileges & have to wander alone through life's uneven  ways, weary & worn. I often rejoice in the anticipation of a future day, when saints will meet & be forever blest.    I wish all my friends to understand that I remain as firm in the faith & doctrines of the Latter day saints as at the begin-  ning that I have not renounced or been shaken in no one principle that I ever embraced Mormonism is my glory  in time & I hope it will be in eternity, but I oftentimes get discouraged & fear I shall not be found worthy.  I neglected to speak particularly respecting your Father & Mother's health. In general I believe they have enjoyed comfortable  health but sometimes complaining. She writes in her last as follows, "I should have written you ere this had it been possible under  existing circumstances. I have a great deal to do this winter of work left behind on account of our past sickness, I have sat  up most of the time at night untill 12 o clock & after & have not got necessary things done yet, my health not very good  not but better than it was a few weeks since, I had a seated pain in my side for 3 or 4 weeks & was afraid I should  get sick with pleurisy or Lung fever which has prevailed here, but have been delivered from ^those^ symptoms. Capt Richards Cowl  was buried yesterday & Mr Camp last week." She did not speak "of your Father," I should not wonder if he failed & d[ink splot]  suddenly. If reports are true respecting your stay on this mission doubtless you will never see your Father [ink splot]  It was reported in the Prophet & also by Brother Sparks that you expected to stay five years, that is a long time. [ink splot]  dire changes may take place ere that period expires. I get the Prophet regularly & it is a source of great co[ink splot]  It a very interesting and instructive paper, containing much upon principle & doctrine that I never had an understand-  ing of before. there was one piece entitled, "Celestial family organization: that was noble. it was written by Elder  Pratt of New York he teaches things both new & old & I am ready to receive it. I think people ougth to be instructed as they  are able to receive. Cousin Eunice says the laws of the Celestial kingdom are such that but few of the saints can  abide them. How can I abide a law that I have no knowledge of, I desire knowledge & instruction beyond what  I have means to obtain. Wonder how you & Cousin Phebe would feel if you could not ever see a Mormon  from one end of the year to the other. I guess some like me. Your Father & mother, & myself desire to go the west  in pursuit of a more congelial clime, but not to Richland. Hereafter I do not expect to enjoy the privileges  for information that I have done three numbers more will close the first volume of the Prophet. The price  is increased to two dollars per annum, which with 75 cts postage will be too much for me to pay under  my limited circumstances, being in no buisness. The Prophet will hereafter be printed in Boston ^386 Washington Street^ the same as  in New York. I think the churches do well in regard to their tithing & donations five hundred dollars was  sent to N. York at one time from Boston, they are all zealously engaged in cause of the Temple.  25 were added to the church in N. York at one time mostly, youths & children. the last account from St. Lewis  10 had recently been baptized by Elder O Hyde at one time, which the congregation stood as solemn witnessess &  many of then overwhelmed in tears. Elder Grant wrote from Philadelphia under date of March 22nd he informs us  that the Saints there, are generally engaged for the welfare of Zion & are doing well for the Temple & for the laws in the  west & they are increasing in numbers in that City & are baptizing new converts from time to time. Several hundred  of tithing for the Temple was sent from that city by Elder Fordham, who came on a special mission & has returned to  the west. she following extracts of a private letter Dated Nauvoo 6th of April, the Prophet copies, (just now received) "The Temple  is rolling up with rapidity & bids fair for a speedy completion. The saints around here seem to take an active interest in it, & each  one manifests a willingness to do all they can. It is a general time of health with us & we yet enjoy peace, notwithstanding the clattering  of the rattlesnakes of Warsaw & the croaking of the filthy toads of Carthage & surrounding mud ponds. It is true they threaten  hard & appear to be making active preparations to do somthing, & I suppose if they could do as they want to, the poor Mormons, would  all be greased over & swallowed up before summer comes, but the saints feel calm and unmoved having their trust in that God  who has defended this Church for the last fifteen years, & the Priesthood from the days of Adam. Ther appears to only one feeling  among the saints here & that is to do the will of God finish the Temple & Nauvoo house & love & defend each other, there is a good  spirit prevails in Nauvoo & things look about right." I will just mention that there has been destructions by fire of late  in the adjoining states, but none so large & destructive as in Pittsburgh 20 square miles burnt millions of property, destroyed  I expect the Rigdonites are burnt over, & also many buildings destroyed by lightning. This reported that England that England &  America are going to war. I wish you would occasionally send us the Millenial Star. If you have sent any papers we have not  received them. Whenever you feel disposed to write us, a letter would meet with a very ^welcome^ reception & I hopp[e] you will write your  Father & Mother often, it will do them good, while deprived of the society of all their children. If you ever get through with reading  this & do ever write again, do take a little larger bit of paper & give us all the news you have. Sister Ann said the thought paper was  rather scarce in your country. She sends her love to you, likewise Br C. My love to Cousin Phebe. From you Cousin B C 
 I have heard nothing from your Br Thompson since you left  I wish you had informed us how your wife likes England, &  whatnot she is expecting to go with you to France &c.  great fire in Virginia & a disease is waiting there. Proving   fatal in almost evry case. Several hundreds persons have died  There are more diseases in our land than I ever knew  before. Perhaps you are informed with regard to all these things    I said to Mother have you no word to send to Wilford  she says tell ^him^ we are all going to starve & freeze to death. I spoke  I told her I thought we should have to wait till next winter before  we freeze. I guess ^we^ will want no more letters from me without an  interpreter. remember us.

 40 Ironmonger Row Saint Lukes London Dec 28th 1840    Elder George A. Smith    Dear Brother  I received two letters  from you one Nov 30 & the other Dec 3d & I should have  written you answers immediately. But Elder Kimball  was writing to you at that time & giving you  all the news so I thought it would be a mere  form if I wrote. But having a few leasure mom-  ents this evening I thought I would say a faew  words to you although I have not much   news to write at this time. But what I have got you  shall have freely. We just received a letter to day  from Elder B Young he said your health was vary poor  which I was sorry to hear. We recieved a letter some  days since from Elder Pitt he had Baptized one man &  others Believing, a Brother in Woolwich wants us to come  down there & prieach. [FIGURE] We attended meeting last evening  at the Independant Chapel & Preached according the   appointment. We had a good many out to hear  & among the rest a Wesleyan Preacher came & Brought  his whole congregation, & as soon as I got through prea  ching Before We closed our meeting, the Methodist preacher  got up, & opposed me with all his power; & tore around  like a madman & I think it done more good than my  preaching, for it made us priests & all the committy of  the house were mad at him, & he was for bid comeing there  to preach any more, [FIGURE] & in fine it made quite a stir  But what the result of it will be I know not. Mr  Albun the preacher that Invited us there thinks he shall 
 not be alone in comeing out & receiving our  doctrin. But with regard to all these things they are  all in the hands of God. Doctor Copeland & his wife  has just come in & wishes us to go to a tea total  Meeting which is expected to be the greatest Ever held  in London As the Celebrated James. Silk.

Buckingham he has just returned from the   United States where he has Been for two years tralg  traveling through every part of our own Country [achain-]  ting Temperance, & the account he gave of the United  States, was truly Interesting & correct, & I never sagw a  man do Better justize to Such a Subject than he  did, he gave an account of all his travels for two years  during which time he visited New York, Boston, Philadelphia  all the Southern State, the house of Congress, Charleston  Georgia New orleans Lexington KY.

River called at St Louis visited Illinois & Iowa extoled  or spoke vary highly of the whole country in that region went  to Galena, Chicago, & the whole length of the Lakes, went   th[r]ough all upper & Lower Canida & held temperance  meetings in all these places, in fine he confirmed our  testimony in every thing about that country 
 Elder Kimball & I sat in front of him & he was informed   by the tea totalers in the Borough that we were Americans  & he eyed us closly while speaking, & the man that  followed him spoke of our speaches in the Borough  this Buckingham is the same man that has traveled   so much all over the world, his travels th[r]ough Asia  & India are Bpublished in America I read them  many years ago & was much [redacted]  he has Been all over Jerusalem [redacted]  any information concerning that ca [redacted]  you I will tell you more ab [redacted]  much of the America India [redacted]  to all parties he is an aged man, [redacted]  of knowledge, talent, & of sound re [redacted]  any subject which he speaks upon [redacted]  interesting peace in the London times for [redacted]  the German Papers concerning the great exertion can  & preperation of all the German gews to spedily return  to Jerusalem to on[c]e more build there temple there  Greater & more Magnificent than ever before.

 Portland April 5th [18]53    Dear Sister & Bro,    M. W's kind letter  of Dec. 31st. via Sacramento is just recd the   paper sent me at the same time has not come  to hand yet, hope it will for I should like  much to see it. I am quite suprised that you   do not receive more letters from me for I   write you occasionally. I did not receive one  of the letters you write me at Sacramento.    We are hoping to see M. W. here one of   these days but hardly dare to expect Mrs W.  however such a thing may happen. It is unnec  essary for me to say that it would afford us   great pleasure. I have been in Portland  the most of the time since I arrived from Cal.   My family came in to day. I have been with  S & Carter, and perhaps may remain here for  a time, Freedom and family came up last  week and are at Scarbro so you will per   ceive that Shuah is at the old place  and I think they must be highly pleased  to get away from Juy. 
 Fathers health continues quite good, he is now  in this 81st. year. Aunt Fabyan is quite smart  our friends generally are well no changes of   importance, Ezra has just been appointed   Collector of Customs of this peace is very pretty  office, with some four thousand dollars per year  beside the [honours].    M. Horner I believe arrived in the   states last winter but as yet has not written  nor forwarded any funds. E. saw Dr. Bernhisel  at Washington who informed him that Horner  froze his feet on the way, perhaps which is the   reason of his not forwarding the money, he should   have written, us—hope and presume we shall  hear soon. I recd. your last letter stating the  amount forwarded at the time. My old affairs  remain much the same as yet, which is a   source of great annoiance to me, exceedingly  unpleasant, but I hope some time to get rid  of them. Mss. Carter is not very smart these  days. In my family affairs would admit of it  I should tryd. to have driven some stock to   Cal. for I am anxious to do some thing to extricate  myself from old debts, Calvin started off with   funds to buy cattle with M. Rollins, but where 
 he came to get out where Mr. R. lived he found  him rather out of health so that they were obliged  to give up the enterprise. I felt quite disappointed   C with me that he thought he should go to   Salt Lake notw he has started, and visit his  friends there, I was glad to him that your prospects  me so pacific and promising. I hope Gods choi  cest blessings may rest on you and yours, that   we may have His grace to direct us in all things  that one may meet his approbation and at   last hear the welcome sentence of come ye bles  sed of my Father inherit the kingdom &c.  Yes, I hope we shall so spend our days her[page torn]  that we may meet in heaven.    Please remember me very kindly to Ms.  Foss and family, ask them to write. I will  write them soon. My respects to Sister  Coward, did she marry the Dr. or his brother?  was she the first wife? did she get her insurance   money, what is Coward doing there?    When I hear from Horner I will write  you at once. Please remember me kindly to  Bro Little. hoping to hear from you soon  I remain, very Truely Yours    I. F. Carter
