But my advise is if you cannot take hold of  the work &amp; go through the whole course to stop &amp;  go no further, we do not want to deceive you Our traditions have been to be vary religious  weare long faces, never tell a story or laugh &amp;c this was the case with the long faced Christians in  Mo &amp; they were the first to strike a dagger to  our hearts. If I wear a strange hat it is not  because of my religion for whare the religion  of a man is in his hat or coat it is not vary extensive  any whare els. And whenever I have seen Elders  trying to preach sumthing large to get a name the  mysteries &amp;c I have believed that such have got yet  much to learn. As many are desireous of hearing  mysteries I will rehears a short sermon or misteriy Elder Kimball has been of long standing in the  Church Preached much, done much good, brought  many souls into the kingdom &amp; had great influene  &amp;c. Elder Amasa L a place to preach whare the Elders had preached  all the mysteries, they wanted us to preached  mysteries, we told them we were not qualified  to preach m for Elder Kimball he could preache the mysteries so they sent abot 40 miles for Elder Kimball  &amp; brought him down as they were so anxious  to hear the mysteries &amp; when he came, he  had a large congregation assembled &amp; he arose  before them &amp; remarked that he had understood  they had sent for him to come &amp; preach the  mysteries to them. I am fully competent  to do it &amp; am happy of having the privilege  And I want the attention of all, &amp; when   ENDENTRY  mysteries. He says the first miystery I shall  present before you is this. Elder Amasa  Lyman wants a Pair of Pantaloons, &amp; it is a  great mystery that an Elder in this church should  want a pair of Briches, &amp; esspecially that  the people should know that they want it &amp;  the remainder of his miysteries were like unto  &amp; the consequence of this serman was that Elder  Lyman got a pair of Pantaloons &amp; Elder Kimball  a Barrel of flour for his family.    for my remarks in the fore part of the day some may think I spoke vary plain. But the  Apology I have to make is I will turn Tompsonian  doctor &amp; give the composition without sweetning This work is all, it is my all. If this work does  not live God knows I dont want to live, And I  want you to understand it, that he that gathereth  not with us scattereth. And they that have tasted  the bitter cup feel it. Wake up ye Elders that  have sought to build yourselves up &amp; not the king- dom of God. Wake up ye that have daubbed  with untempered morter. Harken &amp; hear me  for I say unto you that if you do not help us build  the Nauvoo House, you shall not inherit  the land of Zion. If you do not help build up  Zion &amp; the cause of God you shall not partake of  their blessings. Many Elders seek to build them- selves up &amp; not the work of God. But when any  one does this no matter who he may be he will  not prosper even if it was one of the Twelve Those of the Twelve &amp; others of the Elders that  have apostitized I have known their hearts   ENDENTRY  they thought I did not know much but I knew  all about them, &amp; when I see men preaching  to build themselves up &amp; not Zion I know what  it will end in. But say you I am young I  dont care if you are young do you know what  you are about, if so Preach &amp; labour for  the building up of the City of Zion concentrat  your means &amp; influence there &amp; not scatter  abroad. Be faithful or you will not be chosen  for the day of chosing is at the door, why  be afraid of a sacrafice I have given my all  many times &amp; am willing to do it again. I  would be glad to hear the Lord say through  his servant Brigham  give again all that he has. I would obey in a  moment if it took the last coat off from  my Back    say a few words I am quite unwell, But I feel  the importance of this work. I have been a  member of this Church 12 years I came out of  the Baptist Church &amp; Joined this &amp; I have passed  through evry thing but death, &amp; we have come  here to call for help to build the Houses &amp; I  have spent $30 to get here &amp; collected $15 dollars We were commanded to come of the Lord But  it seems as though but few felt interested in it Here I see three Brethren going to the far  distant Islands. I could weep for them they have  but little money to help themselves. I feel inter- ested in this great work we have come out to  Reep but do we have time to Reep new grain   ENDENTRY  that is reaped you think that Elder Young  has put the flail on rather heavy. But it is  nothing to be compaired with the Threshing  you will get in Zion, &amp; those that have the harde- st heads have to be thrashed the hardest,  but dont be troubled about the chaff when  it comes to the barns God will prepare a great  wind Mill that will blow all the chaff away I speak in Parables. I compare the Saints  to a good cow, when you milk her clean she  will always have an abundance of milk to give, but  you milk her a little &amp; she will soon dry up So with the Saints if they do but little in building  up Zion they soon have but little to do with, this  was the case in Cincinnati I had a dream concerning  the saints there. I thought I was in a field of  wheat that was stacked up &amp; we had got to draw  it into the barn come to open the stack the bun- dles would all fall to peices &amp; it was filled  with clusters of Rats &amp; mice, who had been  eting up the grain. I thought these Rats &amp;  mice were the Elders &amp; official members who  had been in &amp; lain on the church, lived on the  wheat eaten then up instead of building up  New churches. So that when the Twelve  came along they could not get any thing for  the Nauvoo House, or Hardly a place  to stay the rats had eat up the wheat so &amp; we  had to go to the world for a home to stay while  we were their, we are not Polished stones like  Elder Blakesley &amp;  Elder Magin &amp;c But we are rough stones out  of the mountain, &amp; when we roll through  the forest &amp; nock the bark off from the trees  it does not hurt us even if we should get a   ENDENTRY  the roll about &amp; knock the corners off the better we  are but if we were pollished &amp; smooth when  we get the cornors knkocked off it would deface  us. This is the case with Joseph Smith he  never professed to be a dressed smooth polished  stone but was rough out of the mountain  &amp; has been rolling among the rocks &amp; trees &amp;  has not hurt him at all but he will be as  smooth &amp; polished in the end as any other  stone, while many that were so vary poliched &amp; smooth in the beginning get badly defaced  and spoiled while the    rest want to know what they shall do. Isaiah  said, I will take one of a city &amp; two of a family  &amp; bring them to Zion &amp; I will feed then with  Pastures after my own heart that will feed  you with knowledge &amp; understanding. And  inasmuch as you harken to council you will  know what the will of the Lord is concerning  you in all things.    I can say any thing to impress the subject upon  your minds that has been spoken upon more  fully than has been done. There are some things  howevere I wish to mention; we have learned  from what we hear this day about the blessings  that will be given when the Temple is finished I will speak of some of the consequences that  will follow if we do not obey. The Lord has  said he will reveal things that have been hid from  the foundation of the world.   ENDENTRY  had the same things revealed. But the Lord  says if you build that house in that time you  shall be blessed, if not you shall be rejected as  a Church with your dead saith the Lord, so  if that house is not built, then in vain is all  our cares, faith &amp; works our meetings &amp; hopes  are veign. But if few do their duty they  will get the Blessing, &amp; we are determined to  do our duty &amp; set these principles before the  Saints we will turn this responsibility upon  the heads of the Saints &amp; clear our garments  &amp; then the Lord is able to endow all the  faithful in some other place. The Lord  gave a revelation several years since &amp; said  gather together your wise men &amp; send up your  moneys &amp; buy lands if not you shall not have  an inheritance but your enemies are upon  you. We went through &amp; told the Saints thes things but did the Churches do as god comm- anded, No they did not &amp; the Revelation was  fulfilled &amp; the Saints driven out. The Lord  says the Church shall give heed to the  words of the Prophet as he is to hold the keys  of the kingdom of God in this life &amp; the world  to come then it is of much consequence that  you give heed to his word, you can ask God if  the work is true &amp; he will give you a testimony I doubt in my own mind if any man can stand  what they will have to pass through unless they  do get a witness for themselves, &amp; I pray  you to give heed to the words the Twelve have  taught you &amp; ask God to help you    tomorrow morning   ENDENTRY September 10, 1843       Meeting was opened by singing &amp; Prayer By Elder  Magin after which Elder W. Woodruff arose  &amp; addressed the assembly from Amos 3  'Surely the Lord God will do nothing dut but he  revealeth his secret The speaker Remarked that according to the  Testimony of the scriptures in all ages of the world  whenever God was abot to Bring a Judgment upon  the world or accomplish any great work, the first  thing the Lord has done has been to raise up a Prophet  &amp; reveal unto him his secrets &amp; send him to warn the  people, that they may be left without excuse. This  was the case in the days of Noah &amp; Lot. God was  about to bring Judgments upon the People &amp; he raised  up Prophet &amp; warned them of it but they did not  give heed to them But rejected their Testimony  &amp; the Judgments came upon them &amp; they were  destroyed, while the Prophets were saved by persui- ng the course marked out by the Lord, Jesus Christ  Testifyed to the Jews of the things that awaited  them as a nation the fall of Jerrusalem &amp; their  dispersion among the gentile world but they did  not believe it yet the secret of all these things  was revealed to the Prophet &amp; Apostles &amp; they  believed it &amp; looked for its fulfillment, &amp; it  came to Pass as it was predicted, though conterary  to the expectations of the Jewish Nations. In like  manner do we look for the certain fulfillment of  those tremendous events upon the heads of the  gentile world, which have been spoken of &amp; pointed  out by all the Holy Prophets &amp; apostles since the world  began who have spoken as they were moved upon  by the power of God &amp; the gift of the Holy Ghost   ENDENTRY  world than the overthrow of Jerrusalem &amp; the disper- sion of the Jews did the Jewish Nation, for  while they stumbled at the stone they were broken  but while it falls upon the heads of the gentile  world it will grind them to powder. And the full  set time is come for the Lord to set his hand to  accomplish thi has done in other ages, so he has done now he has  raised up a Prophet &amp; ^is^ revealing unto him his secrets  &amp; through that Prophet He has brought to light the  fullness of the everlasting gospel to the present  generation, &amp; is again once more for the last time  esstablishing his church upon the foundation of  the Ancient Apostles &amp; Prophets Christ Jesus  Being the chief corner stone. In the church is  now found Judges as at the first &amp; councillors as  at the beginning. The church is composed of Apostles  &amp; Prophets, Pasters &amp; Teachers, gifts &amp; graces for  the perfecting of the saints the work of the  ministry &amp; the edifying of the body of Christ The Lord has raised up servents &amp; sent into the  vineyard to prune the vineyard once more for  the last time, to Preach the gospel of Jesus Christ  to warn the Nations that they may be left without  excuse in the day of their visitation &amp; to gather the  honest in heart &amp; the meek of the earth that Zion  may be built up &amp; the Prophets fulfilled; one of  the secrets that God has revealed unto his Prophet  in these days is the Book of Mormon, &amp; it was a  secret to the whole world untill it was revealed  unto Joseph Smith, home whom God has raised up as a  Prophet Seer &amp; Revelator unto his people. This  record contains an account of the ancient inhabita nts of this continant who over spread this land with  cities from sea to sea, the ruins of which still remain   ENDENTRY  power &amp; greatness. it also points out the essta- blishing of this  decline, &amp; fall, &amp; those predictions contained in  the Book of Mormon, the stick of Joseph in  the hands of Ephraim will as truly be fulfilled  as those contained in the Bible the stick &amp; record  of Judah, &amp; Both of these records contain Prophesys of Great import, concerning the  gentile nations &amp; esspecially this land &amp; nation which  are not yet fulfilled, but must shortly come  to pass, yea its fulfillments is nigh even at the door Though the secretts which God is revealing  through his servant the prophet ##Amos 3:7## in the last days, may  be unpopular &amp; unbelieved by the world  yet their unbelief will not make the truth  of God without effet any more than it did  in the days of Noah or in the fall of Jer- rusalem. When Jesus Christ said their should  not be left one stone upon another in the Temple  that should not be throw^n^ down The Jew nation did not believe it neither would they  receive such testimony but they were ready  to look at outward circumstances, &amp; ready to say  who can prevail against us what nation like  onto our nation, we have held the giving of the  Law the articles, the Urim &amp; Thumim, the  Lawgiver has never departed from between  our feet. We have held the power of government  from generation to generation &amp; what nation now  hath power to prevail against us, &amp; through this  ordor of reasoning they were Blinded &amp; knew not  the day of their visitation they understood not  the things that belonged to their peace. They  rejected their Lord &amp; king, contended against   ENDENTRY  on the cross with many who followed him. But  this did not hender the fulfillment of the words  of Jesus Christ concerning that nation, the words of  the Lord had gone out of his mouth &amp; could not  return unto him void, the things that belonged to  their Peace were hid from their ^eyes^. they were count ed unworthy as a nation. The kingdom was to be rent  out of their hands &amp; given to annother, the die was  Cast &amp; Judgment must come. The city was soon  surrounded by the roman army led on by the  inspired Titus, &amp; a scene of calamity judgment &amp;  immediately overspread the inhaditants of that city  which was devoted to destruction, such a calamity  as never before had rested upon the nation of Israel Blood flowed through their streets tens of thousands  fell by the edge of the sword, &amp; thousands by famine women were evil towards the children of their  own bosom in the straitness of the seige the seen- ery of which shocked the roman soldiers as they  entered the city. The Jews were crucified in  such numbers by their enemies, that they could find  no more wood for crosses or room for their bodies  in their midst, &amp; while dispair was in evry face  &amp; evry heart sinking, while suffering under the  chastning hand of God their enemies rushed upon  them in the city to strike the last fatal blow &amp; as  their last resort they rushed in to the Temple for  safety which was soon on fire &amp; they sunk in the  midst of the flames with the cry of their suffering, assending on high accompanied by the smoke of her  crackling spires &amp; the remaining miserable few were  sold as slaves &amp; driven like the dumb ass before his  burthen &amp; scattered as corn is sifted in a sive through- out the gentile  from its foundations &amp; the Temple thrown down  &amp; the foundation thereof plowed up that not   ENDENTRY  Jerrusalem should be trodden down of the gentiles  untill the times of the gentiles be fulfilled which  has been the case to the vary letter untill the present  generation. ##Luke 21:24## Will not God in like manner as truly  &amp; faithfully bring to pass those great, important and  tremendious events upon the heads of the gentile  world which have been proclaimed by the Prophets  Daniel, &amp; many of the Holy  Prophets &amp; Christ &amp; the Apostles, on the continant of  Asia as well as  others who wrote on the continant of America  all of which have proclaimed these things as they  were moved upon by the spirit of Inspiration the  power of God &amp; the gift of the Holy Ghost. The  Apostle says that no prophecy of the scriptures is of  any privat interpetation, but commandments  came not of old time by the will of man but  Holy men of God spake as they were moved upon  by the Holy Ghost. Isaiah soul seemed to be on  fire &amp; his mind wraped in the visions of the Almighty  while he declaired in the name of the Lord, that it  should come to pass in the last days that God should  set his hand again the second time to recover the  remnant of his people, assemble the outcast of Israel  gather together the dispersed of Judah, make men  go over dry shod, gather them to Jerrusalem on  horses mules swift beasts &amp; in charriost to rebuild  Jerrusalem upon her own heaps, ##Isaiah 11:11-15## while at the same  time the destroyer of the gentiles was on his way  &amp; while God was turning the captivity of Israel, he  would put all their curses &amp; aflictions upon the  heads of the gentiles their enemies, who had not  saught to recover them but to destroy them &amp;  had troden them under foot from generation to  generation, at the same time the standard should  be lifted up that the honest in heart &amp; the meek  among the gentiles should seek unto it &amp; that   ENDENTRY  Holy City, that the glory &amp; power of God shou ld rest upon her, &amp; be seen upon her that  the watchman upon mount Ephraim might cry  arise ye &amp; let us go up unto zion the city of the Lord  our God, that the gentiles might come to her light  &amp; kings to the brightness of her rising. That the  Saints of God may have a place to flee to &amp; stand in  Holy places while judgment works in the earth that when the sword of God that is bathed in heav- en falls upon Idumie or the world when the Lord  pleads with all flesh by sword &amp; by fire &amp; the slain  of the Lord is many that the saints may escape these  calamities by fleeing to the places of refuge like Lot  &amp; 24  account of the calamity &amp; Judgments that shall come  upon the heads of the gentile nations, &amp; this because  they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances  &amp; broken the everlasting covenant. St Paul says  to his Roman Brethren that if the gentiles do not  continue in the goodness of God they like the house  of Israel should be cut off. ##Romans 11:20-22## Though Babylon says I  sit as a queen am no widow &amp; shall see no sorrow  The Revelator says. Therefore shall her plagues come  in one day death and mourning and famine &amp; she  shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is  the Lord God who Judgeth her. ##Revelation 18:7-8## Jesus Presents  a parable of the Fig tree that when we see the signs  in the sun, moon  which he spoke we might know that his coming  is near that the generation in which those signs  appeared should not pass away untill all should be  fulfilled. Though Heaven &amp; earth should pass away  his words should not pass away but should all be  fulfilled ##Luke 21:7-33##   ENDENTRY  the heads of the present generation notwithsta- nding they are not looking for it neither do they  believe it yet their unbelief will not make the  truth of God without effect, the signs are  appearing in the heavens &amp; on the earth and  all things indicate the fulfillment of th Prophets the figtree is leaving summer is nigh. And the Lord  has sent his angels to lay the foundation of this  great and important work, then why should not  God reveal his secrets unto his servents the  Prophets ##Amos 3:7## that the Saints might be led in  paths of safety that they may escape those  evils that are about to engulf a whole genera- tion in ruin   ENDENTRY September 12, 1843    I left Boston at 5 oclock in the  express train of cars for Portland and about  10 oclock while passing through the Chesterwoods  6 miles south of Kennebunk the engine was  thrown from the track in consequence of a rail  being raised 8 inches by some designing miscrant The force was such that It drove the engine  about 5 rods ahead and smashed it to peaces  with the Baggage cars piled top of it &amp; the first passengers cars followed in  pile  not dangerous, another was slightly injured. The  lives of many were in danger, &amp; it seemed a mystery  that so little injury comparatively was done. Four  cars were filled with passengers &amp; had not the  force been broaken by the baggage cars many  lives would have been lost. The Baggage car  soon was on fire which was with difficulty  extinguished.  was thrown about 3 rods &amp; escaped with a slight  injury. But the engineer Mr Adams from  Portland was buried beneath the pile &amp; instantly  Killed, the ruins had to be removed before the  body of the enigneer could be obtained he has left  a wife &amp; one child to mourn his loss. No blame  could possibly be attached to him as the rail was  raised in such a manner that no warning was  given untill the engine &amp; Baggage car was a pile of  ruins. Mr Thomas Hall opened his house for the  reception of the passengers &amp; much praise is due to  the whol household for the attention that was paid  them. I spent most of the night here in the woods  &amp; got chilled through, they sent to Portland  for another engine, which arived in time to  take us to portland in the morning on my arrival   ENDENTRY September 13, 1843    I furnished the Editor of the American with  an account of the accident.  FIGURE I visited Br Ezra Carter &amp; his family I  wrote 2 letters one to the Editor of the  Boston Bee giving an account of the accident  &amp; one to Elder Taylor with an account of the  accident &amp; sent him 10 subscribers for the  papers &amp; wrote a few words to Phebe.  I had an interview with Aunt Judith Carter the first time I had seen her. I visited Ezra store he is doing a good deal of business I walked out to scarborough in the evening  &amp; at arived at Father Carters in the evening  with blistered feet.

I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep &amp; took breakfast   ENDENTRY  gospel. We took a farewell of them &amp; walked to Charleston we here visited the Bunkerhill Monument &amp; walked upon the entrenchment that was flung up by our brave fathers during the night before that memorable battle that was fought upon Bunker Hill but the roar of cannon &amp; clash of arms had long since ceased &amp; the green turf was now trod in safety &amp; the sound from the populous city of Boston was now echoing through the air while our fathers sleep in peace. We had a view of the navy yard as we passed along from thence we entered the city of Boston being the first day my eyes ever beheld its welth or my foosteps ever trod its streets I spent several hours in visiting this city which contained a pop of about 100,000 inhabitants &amp; also as near beatiful &amp; well furnished market probably as any in America. We visited the statehouse which was splendid. I walked to the Cupalo &amp; had a fair view of the whole city. I walked around the commons which was enclosed with an Iron railing of about 2 1/2 miles in length I visited the Tremont House the most noted public house in the city, &amp; also the shiping.

Rockwood who had been cast into prison by his enemies for debts in order to trouble and distress him, when I arived at the prison the Jailor permitted me to enter into the room whare he was &amp; it was truly a happy meeting for althoug we were strangers after the flesh yet we were united in the spirit. This was the first time I ever entered into a prison to see an Elder of Israel but after the keeper of the prison doors had turned the key upon us &amp; left us together to comfort each other in the midst of Iron grates &amp; bars I began to inquire into the state of his mind and it gladdened my soul to find him strong in the GOD of Abram Daniel &amp; Eligah he was rejoicing in God contented in his mind &amp; strong in the faith once deliverd to the saints Brother Rockwood had the Bible, Book of Mormon, P. P. Pratts voice of warning, &amp; the Evening &amp; Morning star as his companions   ENDENTRY  souls were made glad. He informed me of many things that had transpired while he was there in gaol &amp; among the variety he made mention of the goal taking fire a few days previous to my visiting him, he said this looked sumthing like a dark hour the fire was roaring over his head while a scene of uproar confusion &amp; distress was upon every hand engines were rapidly playing around the building—water pouring into every room the people hallowing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy to be  lest they be consumed in the fire one of the number was strugling in the agonies of death while others were cursing &amp; swearing &amp;c Br Rockwood said he felt composed through the confused scenery untill the fire was extin- guished &amp; silence once more was known in the gaol. Elder Rockwood was writing his life while in this state of confinement he sent a roll of the same by me to his Holliston, at half past 8 oclock P.M. the Jailor came &amp; unlocked the prison doors &amp; I took the parting hand with this worthy Brother while he manifested much Joy for my visit. Well whose soul would not be cheered to have a friend visit them while cast into prison. I left him in good spirits &amp; bent my way back again to the city of Boston while crossing the long bridge on my return I herd the cry of fire, the ringing of Bells, the ratling of the engines, I soon beheld the flames begin to illuminate the city it was however extinguished in half an hour by the flood of water that was poured in upon the fire from the engines. I then crossed into the city &amp; being alone &amp; a stranger &amp; in the darkness of the night I lost my way in the midst of the city, but after wandering a wile I called into Myrtle street No 9 &amp; I there found Elder Ball with a company of saints in a room occupied by Sister Vose all were patiently waiting for me, it was a happy meeting. Notwithstanding it was late in the evening I spent a season in teaching them the things of God I then left these sisters who are patient in tribulation &amp; wal- ked with Elder Ball into Butoph street No 12 whare Elder Ball resides with his Mother we here spent the night which ended this day of variety FIGURES Distance of the day 25 miles   ENDENTRY May 12, 1838       vanities from different parts of the world......
