 LOGAN, the County Seat of Cache County, Utah, is located 65 miles north of Ogden, in the centre of the Cache Valley. To describe its wonder-ful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied sce-nery, or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is 60 miles in length from north to south, and 12 miles in width, containing nearlyone-half million acres of land that will grow all the products of the temperate zone, and of such productiveness that five acres intelligently handled willyield more than an ordinary farm in the Eastern or Middle States. Logan is the commercial and agricultural centre of this magnificent valley, and iscompletely surrounded by the Wasatch range of mountatins, the altitude of the valley being 4502 feet above the Pacific ocean. The waters of the Loganand Blacksmith fork rivers are capable of furnishing the finest water power in the west, and are filled with trout and other fish The writer will heresay that for investors seeking where unlimited facilities afford themselves, Logan is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be de-sired, a short, mild winter and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, sizeor productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Logan has a population of over 6000. Onyx and allthe precious metals are all around here, and for investment of money this County cannot be excelleed. Logan has one railroad, a branch from CacheJunction on the U. N. R. R., extending 42 miles in length. Logan is the educational center of Utahâ€”the Agricultural College, capable of accommodating1000 students, where all art and science is taught. The Brigham Young and New Jersey Colleges, all creditable institutions and worth of patronage.The writer will mention that all lines of business are represented here, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops,and foundries, all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer forbeauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be enjoyed without a single drawback, we saycome and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of this will recieve a prompt reply.Union Meat Market,Logan, Utah, Sept 21 1894J. C.

You paid me $100 in gold on that account. Now I want to[smudged ink] if I borrowed $100 of you on your own account. If so, did I give a note for [smudged ink] I have no recollection in the world of borrowing $100 of you, outside of the $100 appropriated by President Taylor. Now, if I did borrow the $100 of [smudged ink] Sister Bleak spoken of, I certainly want to pay it. It seems strange to [smudged ink] I forget it, for I am generally very particular about borrowing money. If I borrowed this money of you, besides the appropriation I do not want[smudged ink] any scruples about it, but if I did, tell me so and I will pay youif I borrowed the money, I would like the day and date, and also say if I have a note.

 53RespectfullyYou Brother.W Woodruff[end of sideways text]Dec. 13, 1890My Dear Bertha Woodruff:[Half of text is warped by water] I have just received your letter of the 15th, and in replywill say, I am very sorry for you, and am sorry that I am not in a situation todayto help you. Ensign called upon me today and wanted me to loan him $100. I amheavily in debt myself, and I have not a dollar to use only what I borrow. I wasnotified yesterday that I must connect the Valley House with the sewer within 10days or be fined. I do not know how much it will cost but it will be a heavy bitI have looked for this trouble that has now overtaken both Marion and Ensign inconsquence of their refusing to obey my counsel. I got them both work on the Street cars at $60 a month cash, but they foolishly joined the stikers, joinedthe Union and our enemies and after this I went to the Superintendent of the company and got him to agree to take both of them back, and I went to them twice andurged them to return to work, but they would not do it. Now they are out of em-ployment and find it necessary to borrow means to live upon. I am sorry for theirwives and children; but as long as they will not take my counsel I do not feel th[at]I am responsible to my family. I have done all I could for them, and they wouldbe all right today if they had hearkened to my advice. Marion did wrong in buying so expensive a barn. He could have built his house and been out of debt; butneither xxxxxx Marion nor Ensign seek my counsel until they get into trouble, andthey then come to me for money. If there is any way opens whereby I can get $50,I will let you have in if I get it. Marion and Ensign both ought to go back to t[he]Railroad company to work. I felt sorry to think they refused me twice after I g[ot]them the chance to go back; but this is all I need to say to you now. I am sorrythat good women and children are made to suffer by the unwise course of their husbands. I pray God to bless you and open the door for you to get the necessariesof life. As ever, Yours,W Woodruff 
 2attending to all the duties of my calling openly and freely. But I am not as youngas I was ten, twenty or thirty years ago, and I find that the cares and labors ofthe Priesthood have not diminished but increased upon me. The Kingdom grows and responsibilities increase, notwithstanding the efforts of the wicked one andall his agencies on earth to prevent it; and although my desire is strong tovisit, counsel and exhort the saints, as in years gone by, the duties of myposition and the increased labors which have fallen upon me seem to make itnecessary for me to shift a large portion of this labor, for the present and fu-ture, upon those who are younger and stronger than I am.In my visit through Utah County recently I attended twelve meetings,speaking at all of them, and enjoying much of the good spirit. But I contracted a severe cold which forced me to desist and return home, and from which I amstill suffering. I hope, however, soon to be fully recovered from it. Havingbeen so long measurably confined to limited quarters, and so little accustomed topublic exercises, Brother Cannon and I felt, perhaps, too much like boys whenwe started out and, so far as I am concerned at least, may have overdone a little.Brother Cannon enjoys his restored liberty exceedingly, although it is far frombeing complete. I trust the Lord will soon remove the yoke of the enemy, so thatour liberty, and that of our families also, may be perfect. We are in the hands ofGod. He has preserved us thus far and developed His purposes in His own way and

 February 15 [189]2Mr John W. Clark,New York City.Dear Sir:Your letter of February 2nd 1892 is before me. Inreply will say that about all I can do is to give you the namesof my Father's family.My Great Grand Fathers name was Josiah. He was over 100 years when he died, in the north part of Farmington, then calledNorthington. I do not know his childrens names.My Grand Father's name was Eldad. His sons names were Eldad, Samuel, Titus, Aphek and Ozem. His Daughters, Helen and Elizabeth.My Fathers name was Aphek. His three sons by his first wife, were Azmon, Thompson and Wilford.  He married hissecond wife, and had six children, all died young.While in London in 1840, I traced the Woodruff family from the London Book of Heraldry; from whom the American Woodruffs descended. A Woodruff was Lord Mayor of London in 1666, about the time of the great fire and plague ofLondon. Two sons of this descendant came to America soonafter the arrival of the "Mayflower," who brought the first

 November 12th 1892.HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,Dear Sir:I received your letter of Nov. 1st several days since,and I have taken the first opportunity I could to answer. I have had a great anxiety myself to see the Woodruff history published, but as yet ithas not been done. I spent one month in London in 1840 and severalmonths in 1846. The Woodruff book of heraldry gives two lineages of theWoodruffs. One spelled Woodroffe, the other Woodruff; the latter familywe are descended from. In about 1666 on of our progenitors was LordMayor of London, about the time of the great fire and plague. I obtainedthe Woodruff Coat of Arms, and impression of which I send you herewith. Twoof our fore-fathers came to America soon after the Mayflower, and settledin Hartford, and soon afterwards John and Matthew Woodruff came and settledin Farmington, from whom you and I descended. John settled in Farmingtonin 1681 and Matthew in 1716. I cannot trace the family in a direct lineto our day. My great-grandfather's name was Josiah. He lived a littlepast 100 years. My grandfather's name was Eldad; his sons were Eldad,Samuel, Titus, Aphek and Ozem; all born in the north part of Farmington, callNorthingtons, now Avon. Eldad's son lived to about 85 years of age.Samuel was 92. My father, Apek Woodruff, died in this city 84 years ofage. My mother, Bulah Thompson Woodruff, died in 1808, leaving three sons;Azmon, Thompson and myself. I was the youngest, being 14 months old.  I was born March 1st, 1807, making me 85 years, 8 months and 12 days old. Myoldest brother, Azmon, died here 87 years old; my brother Thompson is stillliving, is in his 87th year.

 December 13th. 1892.HENRY LEWIS WOODRUFF,Dear Sir:I have received your letter of Dec. 2nd. with geneologicalhistory enclosed; and I feel under great obligation to you for them, as I,like yourself, am deeply interested in the Woodruff genealogy. And Isign to say, it does not require an apology on your part for making thecorrections you offer concerning what I wrote you, as I very much desireto have everything pertaining to this matter as correct as it is possibleto get it; and I am satisfied that you are as near correct as a person canbe by searching the records and works at your command. In regard to what I said concerning the lineage of the two English Woodruffs and the spell-ing of their names, I acted upon what was before me; but you, doubtless,have better sources of information that I.With regard to Matthew and John Woodruff who settled in Hartford andFarmington, what I wrote you regarding them I took from the History ofHartford County, by J. Hammond Trumbull; and I should, of course, have men-tioned the source of my information.As to the spelling of the Woodruff name in so many different ways, I do not wonder so much at that, for the reason, as you yourself havedoubtless learned, that it is quite a common thing for a name in the courseof generations to undergo a variety of changes in spelling without in theleast affecting the lineage. As to whether Matthew and John Woodruffwere brothers or not I really do not know myself; I have come to regardthem as such here by way of taking it for granted than from actual gene-alogical or historical knowledge.

I sold that30 acres to my son Wilford, and I considered that that ended my con-nection with the land. I did something about the fencing, but Ido not know how much it was nor what it was. Of course, we ahvenever occupied any of it, but my son, I think, rented someof it toyour cousin. I have talked with Wilford this morning concerning thisletter, and he says you have some feelings about a mule that you letFlavel Spencer have and you hold Wilford responsible for it in someway; but this is a matter that I have no knowledge of nor any respon-siblility in. I have too much on my hands to be troubled with anythingabout this land.

 Dec. 12, 1893.Prest. Geo. G. Cannon,Dear Brother:I write to say that I am calling some young men to be missionaries to Germany, including three bankers,A. Owen Woodruff and McEwan, of the State Bank, abd Brother Schettler's son, and expect to call some others. We understand that Brother Schaerrertime is out and he epxects to come home and we want someone to preside,and Brother Joseph says you once named your son Hugh. Now our boys feelthat they would like very much to labor under him if he could go and pre-side there, and before writing to you I sent for him to come and see me.I have just had an interview with Hugh; he feels as though he would not like to go Germany to preside, but if he went he would rather go as a missionary and some one else to preside, but that is the very kind of a man that ought to preside and not one who is seeking the office. Nowconcerning Hugh, I do not know that he ought to be called to go upon any mission at present. He has lately returned from a mission there and goneinto business, though I think he is not much involved in debt. I felt to lay the matter before you and get your counsel upon it, and can you nameany one who would be suitable to preside there. ^if Hugh did not go^ The 20th of January isthe time named to start. I would be glad of an early reply to this.Now concerning our affiairs east, of course we are interested in all your labors and accomplishments. We see from the press that thereis a good prospect of the Utah Bill for Admission passing the House,which we hope may be accomplished; and also through the Senate and becomea law.

 REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Tab-ernacle, Great Salt Lake City, May 19, 1867. [REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.]I also am a missionary, and I alwaysconsidered it a great honor to be one. Ireceived a mission when I embracedthis work; it has never been taken fromme yet. In company with a number ofthe brethren I have just returned, as br. Taylor has said, from visiting ourbrethren in the south. We have hadan excellent time. We have been over a great many rough roads, traveled hard, and have preached from once to three times every day. We have been taught, instructed and edified; at leastI have a great deal. We have had a good time in visiting the Saints, and asPresident B. Young remarked in some of his discourses, we have been able todraw the contrast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world. My own experience enabled me to bringthat subject home very readily, and Ipresume it is so with most of the Elderswho have been on missions preachingthe gospel. I have travelled a greatmany thousands of miles to preach thegospel without purse or scrip, with my knapsack on my back and begging my bread from door to door. I have donemany things that all the gold in Cali-fornia would not have hired me to doexcept for the gospel. My natural feel-ings would forbid me travelling throughthe world asking for my bread from door to door; I would much sooner laborfor it.We have been called to preach the gospel; the Lord Almighty has requiredit at our hands; we would have been un-der condemnation as elders if we hadnot done it. We have done it, and our garments, in a great measure, areclear of the blood of this genera-tion. For over thirty years we havelabored to preach the gospel; and wehave gathered together a people to thesevalleys of the mountains, with whom I rejoice to meet. I once asked the Lord to let me go and preach the gospel. I had a desire to preach the gospel in itsbeauty, plainness and glory, and toshow the worth of the principles it con-tained. I felt that they were of as much value to my fellow men as to me. The Lord gave me the privilege I asked for, and I believe that I have preached tothe nations of the earth as much as Idesire; if duty should not require it, I never wish to go and preach to the world again. I have had my day andtime at it; still, if called to go, I pre-sume I should go as I have always done. But I do enjoy the society of the Saints, I love home, and I love to travel through these settlements and to seethe boys, the girls, the men, and the women parading the streets to welcome the President and his brethren. Andon our return here, to meet with greet-ings from ten thousand Saints brought peculiar meditations to my mind. It brought home very forcibly the con-trast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world.In my early missions, when preach-ing in the Southern Statesâ€”Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentuckyâ€”I have waded swamps and rivers and have walked seventy miles or more without eating. In those days we counted it ablessing to go into a place where there was a Latter-day Saint. I went once 150 miles to see one; and when I gotthere he had apostatized and tried tokill me. Then, after travelling seventy-two miles without food, I sat down to eat my meal with a Missouri mobocrat,and he damning and cursing me all thetime. That is the nature of the South-ern people, they would invite you toeat with them if they were going to cut your throat. In those days we might travel hundreds and hundreds of milesand you could not find a Latter-day Saint; but now, thank God, we havethe privilege of travelling hundreds and hundreds of miles where we canfind but little else. I regard this as a great blessing.Our missionaries are going abroad un-der different circumstances from what we went. We had no Zion, no Utah, no body of Saints to give us any assis-tance. We were commanded to go without purse or scrip, and we had to do it. We trusted in the Lord, and He fed us. We found friends, built up churches, and gathered out the honestand meek of the earth. Times have changed since then. These brethrenare going to the nations of the earthwhere starvation stares many of thepeople in the face, and where it is hard for millions to obtain the necessaries oflife. The people here are wealthy, and itis no more than right that we should im-part of our substance to help those whoare going on missions. I hope thebrethren and sisters will help liberally, and will impart sufficient to send thebrethren to their several fields of labor.I rejoice in the gospel of Christ; I re-joice in the principles that have beenrevealed for our salvation, exaltationand glory. I rejoice in the establish-ment of the work in these mountains;and in our southern settlements. As has been already said, the Lord has blessed our brethren there. It is a miracle to see those settlements, when we consider what the country was such a short time since. The city of St.George is second to none in the Terri-tory unless it be Great Salt City; and I doubt the latter being equal toSt. George when we take into consider-ation the population of the two places.They have better buildings and im-provements there, according to the num-bers, than we have here. At Tokerville, too, they are laying fine foundationsfor stone and brick buildings, and theyare improving all through the southern settlements. The soil there is so sandy that it looks as if it would require two men to hold it together long enough fora hill of corn to grow: like the waves of the sea, it is ever on the move; it con-tains, too, a good deal of mineral which destroys the vegetation and everythingwith which it comes in contact. Someof the brethren have spent as much astwo thousand dollars to render an acre of land productive; now they have finegardens and vineyards growing, andstrange to say, though the country, na-turally looks like a desolate, barren, sandy, unfruitful desert, still the cattleare fat, all kinds of stock look well and everything was green and flourishingin the settlements as we passed through them. The whole of that mission at its commencement presented a most for-bidding aspect, and really had so manydiscouraging features that men were compelled to work by faith and not by sight. Now, however, the soil is bless-ed, the climate is delightful, and plenty and prosperity attend the labors of the people. To show you the difference of the climate in the cotton country, and of the district of country a few milesthis side of it, I need only mention that the morning we left Beaver there wasice along the creeks; but when we gotto Tokerville, two days travel further south, we found the apricots half grown,the peaches as large as peas, the cotton-wood trees green and in full leaf, alto-gether looking like another country. It is a different climate altogether from what it is in these higher places.The hand of God is in all the opera-tions we are trying to carry out. We have to build up Zion independent of the wicked; we have got to become self-sustaining, and the Lord is inspiringHis prophets to preach to us to lay thefoundation for the accomplishment ofthis work. The day is not far distant when we shall have to take care of our-selves. Great Babylon is going to fall;judgment is coming on the wicked; the Lord is about to pour upon the nations of the earth the great calamities which He has spoken of by the mouths of His prophets; and no power can stay thesethings. It is wisdom that we shouldlay the foundation to provide for our-selves.With regard to the Word of WisdomI must say I was agreeably surprised to see how generally the people are taking hold of it. We did not see much coffee,nor tea; and I do not think that one inthe company drank a drop of it. I re-joice in this: it is going to make the peo-ple more wealthy; it will save us a greatdeal of means, besides preventing ourbeing poisoned to death, for these things are poisoned, and the Lord un-derstood that when He gave the Word of Wisdom many years ago. The peo-ple are improving in a great manythings. There is a very good spirit and feeling among them; and the feeling to carry out the purposes of God is gen-eral.I rejoice in this work because it is true, because it is the plan of salvation, the eternal law of God that has been re-vealed to us; and the building up of Zion is what we are called to perform. I think we have done very well consid-ering our traditions and all the difficul-ties which we have had to encounter; and I look forward, by faith, if I live afew years, to the time when this peo-ple will accomplish that which the Lordexpects them to do. If we do not, our children will. Zion has got to be builtup, the Kingdom of God has got to beestablished, and the principles revealedto us have to be enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints. There is no principle that God has revealed but what has salva-tion in it, and we, in order to be saved, must observe His laws and ordinances.Where is there a man or woman who does not wish to be saved? All wish to be saved; all desire salvation and toenjoy those blessings which they were created to enjoy. The gospel has been offered to this generation for the purpose of saving them in the Kingdomof God if they will receive it. I rejoicein all the principles revealed to us, andthe more I see, hear and learn, the more I am satisfied of the importance of the revelations that God has given to us. As President Young remarked in one of his sermons south, "Whatever the Lord reveals to this or any other people, doesnot ignore anything revealed before." No part of the gospel is superfluous. Itis the same yesterday, to-day and for ever; and all the inhabitants of this world and all others, have got to be saved byit, if saved at all. It is necessary, there-fore, that we receive and obey all of its principles. When the first principles of the gospel were revealed to us we re-joiced in them. After them we hadother principles revealed, the principle of baptism for the dead for instance. We did not know anything of that un-til about the year 1840, on our returnfrom England. I rejoice in that princi-ple. It is a great blessing that there can be saviors on Mount Zion. It is a glorious principle that we can go forthand erect temples and attend to ordi-nances for the living and the dead; thatwe can redeem our forefathers and pro-genitors from among the spirits in pri-son. They will be preached to in prison by those spirits on the other side of the vail who hold the keys of theKingdom of God; and we will have the privilege of attendidg to ordinances in the flesh for them. Then, again, the blessing of that God has revealed to us inthe patriarchal order of marriageâ€”be-ing sealed for time and eternityâ€”is notprized by us as it should be. When that principle was revealed, the Pro-phet told the brethren that this king-dom could not advance any furtherwithout it; "and," said he, "if you donot receive it you will be damned saith the Lord." You may think this very strange, but the Lord never reveals anything that He does not require to behonored.What would have been our position if this had not been revealed? Thisprinciple is plain, clear and interesting;without it not a man in this Church could have either wife or child sealed to him for eternity. For all ourmarriage covenants before were onlyfor time; and we as a Church had ar-rived at that point, when in order to en-sure a full salvation it was necessary to reveal this principle. It is a great bless-ing to us. We love our wives and children, and wish to enjoy their soci-ety; but the thought of separation would mar all the happiness that the Saints might otherwise attain. TheSaint who aspires to salvation and glo-ry wants a continuation of family ties and associations after death. Withoutthis principle we were like the rest of the world,â€”without any such hope. From the day those apostles were slainuntil the Lord revealed this principle in the last days, not a man ever dweltin the flesh who had wife or child sealedto him for eternity, so that he could en-joy their society in the resurrection. That was just our position before thisordinance was revealed; but now, whether we have one wife, two, threeor as many as the Lord sees fit to bestow upon us, when we come forth from the grave our families remain with us in the eternal world. So it is with every principle that the Lord revealsâ€”it is good for His people in time and eternity.Brethren and sisters, let us be faith-ful, and look at the promises of God as they are contained in the gospel of Christ, and never treat lightly any prin-ciple, no matter what it is; whether it be faith, repentance, baptism for the re-mission of sins, the resurrection of the dead, eternal judgments, the marriagecovenant, baptism for the dead, or anyother ordinance that the Lord has revealed; they all belong to the kingdom, are necessary to salvation, and the responsi-bility of carrying them out rests upon this people. We know that the world looks with contempt upon us and upon the institutions of the kingdom of God. They do not object to institutions that are corrupt and ungodly. The world isflooded to-day, with evil and wicked-ness, and the earth groans under it. But because we as a people follow the example of Abraham, in taking morewives than one, we are universally de-cried and despised. The Christian world profess to believe in Abraham, and he through obedience to the com-mand of God in this respect, was calledthe "Father of the faithful;" and thetwelve gates of the New Jerusalem willeach be named after one of the twelve patriarchs, his descendants, and the sons of a polygamist, and fathers of all Israel. Even the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came to lay down his life to redeem the world, was through the same lineage. He was of Judah; He was the King of the Jews and the Sa-vior of the world.These principles are as righteous to-day as in any other age of the world,when governed and controlled by the commandments of God. Let us prizeall the principles, revelations and bless-ings that God has revealed to us; let us treasure them up, do our duty to God, to one another and our fellow men. No man has any time to sin, to steal, swearor break any of the laws of God, if hewishes to secure a full and complete salvation; but we must all do the best we can, laboring with all our might to overcome every evil, for it will take a whole life of faithfulness and integrity,for any Saint of God to receive a full salvation in the presence of God.May God bless us, and give us His spirit and wisdom to guide and directus into all truth; for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said he regarded our experiencein the Church as a more valuable schooling than any people hadever enjoyed. The Saints did not realize their priveleges nor availthemselves of the blessings they might enjoy. No one who held anyoffice in the Priesthood should feel that their offices were unimportant.He related instances in his own experience to illustrate the power andblessings attending him while attending acting in the Lesser Priesthood.Those who would magnify their callings in the smallest office in thePriesthood were as much entitled to the blessings and powers pertaining to theirrespective callings as the Apostles in their sphere. The hour of Godsjudgement was at hand and it was important that the saints shouldmagnify their callings. We need not fear the wicked for God wouldfight our battles, and all would be fulfilled that had been declared con-cerning Zion. He regretted that there were so many who were indifferentto their callings. It was important that the brethren and sisters shouldsustain the various organizations effected for the benefit of the Saintsboth young and old. He urged the Saints to read the revelationsof God, and to become familiar with the will of the Lord and Hispurposes concerning this people.

 President Wilford Woodruff said, that when the saints came herethey had their inheritances divided to them, and he did not feel thathe had a right to sell to anyone, and he would not lease land for a sa-loon or any immoral purpose. We should maintain our inheritances, forthose who are not Saints did not come here to build up Zion. 
 -2-and accomplish the desires of your hearts. We are all ^well^ as usual. Brother Joseph joins me in saying God bless you, and remember us kindly to ourfriends Clawson, the Colonel, and General C.Your Brother in the Gospel,Wilford Woodruff 
 President Wilford Woodruff was pleased with the interest that was beingmanifested in these associations.  The time in which we were living required that we should prepare and qualify ourselves for the promotion of the cause of Zion, and all such organizations would have this tendency, having been organized under the inspiration of God. He was thankful that he lived in a time and with a peo-ple who believed in and sought for the faith and enjoyed the same that was once delivered to the Saints. Zion was growing and the glory of God would soon begin to rest upon her, and it was important that we laid aside all that was between us and the Almighty.  He urged the importance of making full and prompt re-ports, and testified that the interest in these organizations would increase.  He also urged the necessity of the young storing their minds with the contents of sacredbooks and particularly the Doctrine and Covenants. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said that the God of Israel had called thispeople out of the world and we need not be surprised if they are opposed tous, for the world had always persecuted the Saints of God, and the onlyhope for the deliverance of this people was in the God of Israel. He wouldsustain and deliver us if we trusted in Him. This gosepl had been rejectedby the Jews and was then preached to and received by the Gentiles. They inturn fell into apostasy. When the gospel was restored again it was preachedfirst to the Gentile nations and as a result of the proclamation of the Gospelthis people had been gathered from the four quarters of the earth. In otherages men had made laws to entrap the people of God, and in all caseswhere men had proven faithful, God had been the friend of His people.This nation was in the hands of God and He would sustain his people if they would do what was right and trust in God. This work was setup never more to be thrown down and no power could stay it progress.The blindness and hypocrisy of the world which was wallowing in cor-ruption in railing against the Latter-day Saints was to be lamented,and must call forth the indignation of a righteous God. It was for usto look to ourselves and set our own houses in order, and trust in Godand all would be well with us, and the nearer we drew to God themore we would increase in light and intelligence. The spirits of thispeople had been reserved to come forth in this day and some of the great-est and best of the children of God that had ever been upon the earthhad come and were coming forth in our day. 
 Prest W Woodruff he bore a strong testimoney to this workbeing of God and said he would still sustain it ashe had done in the past in spite of all opposingpowers all combined against it 
 Prest Woodruff bore testimoney to the truth of Bro Cannons remarksand said that out of the fourteen hundred millions ofthe peoples of the earth not more then half of amillion had been baptized into this church, and itwould only be a few compared th with the countlessnumbers of the teeming millions of the earth thatwould gain the celestial Kingdom of our God 
 Prest Woodruff gave us some of his early missionaryexperience and said he had only been instrumentalin the hands of the Lord and all honor was dueto God 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff adressed himself to the Priest-hood. Told how the Prophet Joseph received the various keys andpowers for the restoration of Zion and the establishment of the king-dom of God on the earth in these days. Repeated the words of Josephto the Twelve, when he rolled off the burden of those duties from hisshoulders to theirs, and reminded his brethren that they too must step for-ward and take the places of those who were about to pass away, andbe ready to carry on the work of God in the earth. There was a great change about to take place in Zion, and in Babylon. The Saintsshould seek God in their secret closets, attend their prayer circles,and not esteem these things lightly. Inasmuch as they did thisthey should know the mind and will of God concerning them, andbe better prepared to accomplish it. 
 President Wilford Woodruff delivered a discourse upon the blessingsand opportunities enjoyed by the Saints the fulfillment of prophecy in the experience and labors of the people of God; dwelling also for some time onthe importance and efficacy of prayer. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said it was gratifying to listen to the words of menwho were alive to their callings. There was a spirit of improvement among the peoplethrough the Church generally. He refered particularly to the marked dispositionon the part of the Saints, of late, to observe the Word of Wisdom. He felt gratified with the spirit that was manifested among the young, giving promise of a multitudewhom the Lord may find worthy to carry on his work. Those who were called to leadshould not be arbitrary in their course, but rather appeal to the judgment of thoseunder them, by teaching good principles and setting a good example. 
 President Wilford Woodruff spoke of the great responsibility devolving upon those who held the Priesthood. It was difficult to express this in words. There weremany millions who died without a knowledge of the truth, to whom the gospelmust be preached and for whom the gospel ordinances must be administered. His faith was that this people had been reserved for the purpose of accomplishing thislabor, and the inhabitants of this earth who had passed away were looking withinterest to the labors of the servants of God in our day, and he was pained to learnthat considering our limited members, there should be any among us who were in-different to their calling. Our time here was but short to prepare for the great eter-nity. He had no fears with regard to the destiny of the work of God. The Lord was onour side and He would protect us. 
 President Wilford Woodruff. Said it made no difference tothe work of the Lord what man or men died. He intended to carryon the work in his own manner. The twelve sons of Jacob wereblessed and promised what should befall them to the latest date. This was evidenced in the histories of the world. God will alwayshave a law-giver in Israel, and any man who supposed the work could not get along without him would find sooner or later that he is entirely mistaken. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said that it was our duty to extend our settlements over the land and occupy it. In pursuance of this policy a number had been called to go to Arizona to settle there, but many had gone to the wrong places which had left the Saints at the settlement of St Johns weak-handed, and as a consequence to a great ex-tent subject to depredations from lawless individuals located at that place. It was considered wise to protect the Saints in their rightsin St. Johns, which was the key to the whole Arizona country and oneof the best locations in it, and to that end the authorities had feltprompted to send more missionaries there to strengthen the hands of the Saints and others desirous of preventing lawlessness. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFNext arose and said as the funeral ser-vices on this occasion not only em-braced the death of Brother DavidHoagland Cannon, whose tabernaclenow laid before the congregation, buta great many other Elders whohad yielded up their lives whilepreaching the Gospel to the nations ofthe earth, an endeavor had been madeto publish these cases as far as theyhad come to the knowledge of theauthorities, and Apostle Richardswould therefore read to those assembledthe list already furnished. After thisBrother Grant would read one of thelast letters written home from abroadby the late David H. Cannon. 
 It is time to close this conference,but before closing I want to say a fewwords to the Latter-day Saints.  I haveattended conferences under the presi-dency of Joseph Smith during his lifetime, from 1833; I have attended con-ferences under President BrighamYoung nearly forty years, from thetime of the death of Joseph Smith un-til his own death; I have attendedconferences under the presidency ofJohn Taylor, and I have attendedconferences as President of the Churchmyself since that period.  That re-sponsibility has rested upon me, andrests upon me today.  Sixty-fouryears of my life have passed away asa member of this Church.  I do notknow that I shall ever address youagain; I cannot tell anything aboutthis; but I feel strongly impressed tosay a few words to you upon pric-ciple, although it is late.I want these Latter-day Saints tolay to heart what has been said to youby the Apostles and Elders who havespoken at this Conference.  I wantto say another thing.  I prophesy, inthe name of Israel's God, the day hascome when the mouths of WilfordWoodruff, George Q. Cannon, JosephF. Smith and these Twelve Apostles,should not be closed because of theopinions of the children of men.  Therehave been feelings that these menholding high positions--the TwelveApostles and Presidency--should saynothing about politics.  I want to sayto you here, the day has come whenGod Almighty requires at your handsto unite together in your temporalbusiness, and in your politics, so faras it is wisdom.  I do not care whethera man is a Republican or a Democrat,in that he is fre; but it is your dutyto unite in electing good men to gov-ern and control your cities, your localaffairs, and I will state that when youdo not do this you are losers of theblessings of Almghty God.  Iwant to tell you this uponthis occasion.  My mouth shallnot be closed upon theseprinciples.  I know it is the duty of theLatter-day Saints to unite togetherin your local affairs, the election ofyour city councils, the election ofyour city councils, the election of mento act for you in the affairs of state.Lay aside your extremes in democ-racy and republicanism, as far as iswise in that matter, and in other thanlocal matters as Latter-day Saintsunite together within your party linesand appoint good men. When you dothat, God will bless you.  You won'tall be taxed to death andlose yourproperty, if you will appoint good menand pursue this course.I take the liberty, as President of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints, of making these remarks.  Nomatter what the feelings of men maybe towards me; I shall not stay in thiscountry very long.  But I realize very well that this people are groaningunder poverty, under affliction, undertaxation, and in positions that theyought not to be if they would only unitetogether and do their duty.  And thisidea of a person being afraid of some-body because he is a Democrate or aRepublican, it is all wrong.  I feellike saying to you, as the Presidentof this Church, and do state, that itis your duty to unite together and ap-point good men to act in every capac-ity for the public welfare.  Thereforelet us do our duty, walk uprightly be-fore the Lord ourGod, and leave theconsequences with Him.  "Do what isright, let the consequences follow;"which may God grant, for Christ'ssake.  Amen. 
 REMARKS BY PRESIDENTWOODRUFF.President Woodruff was then pre-sented to the audience by Mayor Clarkand was received with the warmestdemonstrations of applause.  The ven-erable Pioneer and leader said in sub-stance:It was fifty-one years ago yesterday,a little before 11 o'clock a. m., that hedrove President Young in his carriageon to the spot where the Knutsfordhotel now stands. On his arrival in thevalley, the speaker had, he said, onebushel and a half of potatoes in hispossession. He had covenanted withthe Lord that he would neither eatnor drink until they were planted, andhe kept his promise. Others of thePioneers also had potatoes with them.They, too, promptly attended to thework of planting. And they wereplanted in the earth, not in the moon(dark or light) as brother Orson Prattobjected to that. (Laughter).There was a man in Nauvoo who builta carriage to suit his own fancy. Ithad a bed 11 feet long, and was en-tered by means of steps and door. Thisvehicle the speaker bought and broughtto this valley. On the Monday morn-ing immediately after the arrival ofthe first Pioneers President Youngtook some of the Twelve Apostles, andwith them walked on a short distancein a northwesterly direction; a halt wassuddenly made and President Young,striking his cane upon the ground, ex-claimed, "Brethren, here will be theTemple of our God."  "I didn't askhim," continued President Woodruff,"who told him the Temple would bethere. I didn't care. I put a stakethere and the Temple is there, a monu-ment to President Young's foresightand prophetic accuracy."After passing over the ground, whichis now Pioneer Square, the party en-tered wagons and started for thePoint of the Mountain, which ap-peared to be about five miles to thewestward. The distance, however, wasmuch greater, being about fifteenmiles. They continued on to BlackRock where President Young, plungedin the brine and toook a bath, beingthe first Mormon to lave in itswaters. He was followed by other mem-bers of the party among whom was acolored man. When the latter emergedfrom the waves the salt brine driedupon his skin and instead of being a black man he was perfectly white.(Laughter.) This transformation, Por-ter Rockwell declared to be the firstmiracle performed in the valley. (Re-newed merriment). But when hewashed himself in fresh water the saltdisappeared and once more the whiteman was black. (Laughter and ap-plause.)On reaching here the Pioneers wereimportuned to continue their journeyto California where it was believedtheir condition could be bettered.President Young said he knew he wasin the midst of a desert with his people,but that would make no differenceThey would build a temple, a city anda commonwealth here.  When the firstmessage flashed across the thenew electric means of com-munication, the words were:"What has God wrought?' And so re-garding the declaration of PresidentYoung, the speaker felt constrainedto say:  "What has God wrought?" Inthese mountain vales are now citiesand town bedecked with temples ofworship, school houses, colleges andthe various conditions of an advancedcivilization.Here President Woodruff pausedbriefly and then said: "Wonderfulchanges have come to this land andpeople since the arrival of the Pioneers,and I want to say that the changes,the progress and increase will be justas great during the next fifty-one yearsas during a similar period that hasjust closed. The destiny of this peopleis before heaven and earth and noth-ing can stay it."President Woodruff then said he wouldspeak of one incident and only oneconnected with the journey of the Pio-neers hither.  It was suggested to himby the presence on the stand of W. C.A. Smoot, who was the youngest teams-ter in the advance guard. It occurrednear the Platte river. One day thelittle band of home and liberty seekerswere startled by seeing to the west,directly ahead of them, what appearedto be a great black cloud close to theearth. To their amazement they dis-covered on approaching nearer that itwas not a cloud, but a solid, mighty,moving body of buffalo, probably thegreatest herd that had ever assembledin the western world. There was greatdanger of being crushed to death bythe mighty horde. What to do was aproblem. But after consultation awedgelike column was thrown out andan opening effected in the herd. Amongthis animated mass of the monarchs ofthe mountains and plains theystruggled on and on for theirown personal salvation for three daysand nights. At one time Brother Smootlost a horse which got mixed up withthe buffalo which were traveling notin a scattered condition but just asclose together as animals could crowdtogether. For ia time it seemed asthough the loss would be permanent,but after a while the horse was re-covered."It always was," said PresidentWoodruff in his closing reference to theincident, "a mystery to me why thatgreat bady of buffalo should have gath-ered together and marched from itsroaming place on the slopes of theRocky Mountains and moved down onto the Platte. It never occurred be-fore; it never occurred since, and willnever occur again."As a finale to his address PresidentWoodruff said he felt that it was hisduty to give President Brigham Youngthe credit of having laid the founda-tion of this city and State. The streetsof Salt Lake City, for instance, werethe widest and most beautiful of anycity on the earth. In the historic cityof Jerusalem, two loaded camels foundit difficult to pass each other. In thiscity, thirty of those caravans of thedesert could do so. President Youngbelieved in fulfilling the commandmentsof God. He believed in doing thingswell. That was a characteristic of thePioneers, no matter what the cost. Forinstance, a mountain was moved at acost of a half million dollars for a foun-dation for the Manti Temple. 
 SALT LAKE CITY. Jan. 7, 1892.On the occasion of the retirement ofElder Karl G. Maeser, D.L.D., from hisactive labors as an instructor and a prin-cipal of our church schools, to devote hisfull time and attention to the duties ofhis exalted position as General Superin-tendent of the Church school system, we,the undersigned, having enjoyed for many years the privilege of students, andlater, the honors of associate teachersunder his immediate tuition and direc-tion do seek to express, though of neces-sity in a feeble and an inadequate man-ner, the esteem and the honor with whichDr. Maeser and his labors are regardedby us.This we do with the approval andco-operation of the General Board ofEducation of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints.Dr. Maeser is in truth the Pioneer Teacher in the Church schools of our people, and since beginning his laborshere he has held a foremost place among the educators of Utah. During the six-teen years of his most efficient and di-vinely inspired principalship, the Brig-ham Young academy of Provo has ad-vanced from the position of a lower gradeschool to that of an academy in fact, withworthy graduates counted by hundredsand present and former students num-bering thousands.We feel that we, in common with the youth of our people, owe to BrotherMaeser an incalcuable debt of gratitudefor his precepts and example, and hiswhole souled devotion in the cause ofeducation amongst us.Our relations with him as our seniorteacher, principal, brother and friendhave been of the most pleasant natureand our affection for him is that of sons,for a loving parent.While we feel that his removal from the field of active teaching is a loss, wefind consolement in the know-ledge that the scope of his in-valuable labors is greatly expanded, and we rejoice that our relations with him will not be entirely severed, for in hiscapacity as General Superintendent ofChurch Schools we shall still regard him as a counselor and a director of ourlabors.Our earnest prayers will be that health,peace and success may attend him in hiswork of love for the youth of Zion, and that the All-wise Father may long spare his life to us and our people.In behalf of the General Board of Edu-cation.WILFORD WOODRUFF, Psesident,GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary,J. E. TALMAGE, D.S.D.,WILLARD DONE, D.B.,JOSEPH NELSON,J. J. WALTON,RICHARD HAAG. 
 President Wilford Woodruff arose and spoke as follows:I wish to say to this assembly of Latter-day Saints that there arethree vancancies in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, in consequence of the organization of the First Presidency. We have felt that it is time to fill that quorum now: at this conference, and the people should be prepared for the presenting by the TwelveApostles of such names as they may feel by the Spirit of God to be worthy and proper persons to receive this ordination or to occupy this position. These Apostles are Prophets, Seers and Revelators. I have confidence in them, I believe they have powerto present such things as would be in accordance with of God.They (the Apostles) presented to me a list of names. I wish here to say, and I want it understood, that neither myself, Presi-dent George Q. Cannon nor President Joseph F. Smith, who are my Counselors, presented any of these names. We left it with the Quorum of the Apostles. I became thoroughly satisfied that they had upon that list such names as would be acceptableto the Lord. We took those and made it a matter of prayer, and the Spirit of the Lord manifested unto me those whomwe should appoint. They have all been accepted by the Quor-um of the Apostles as well as the Presidency of the Church. I have a reason for making these remarks. 
 "Presidents Office,Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsSalt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 2, 1889.To the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors.Dear Brethren:There never was a time probably in our history, when the Latter-day Saints needed more than they do at present the assistance which Godhas promised to render to us. He has made precious promises to HisChurch; among them He has said that no weapon that is formedagainst Zion shall prosper. This will be fulfilled to the very letter. TheLord's word cannot fail. But it is for us, as a people, to place ourselvesin such a condition that we can ask the Lord in faith for these bless-ings, and receive them at His hand. We should so live that He willfeel bound by His promises to come to our aid and to fulfil Hiswords to us. We have never appealed to Him in vain. He has always listened to our supplications when we have approached Him aright.The knowledge of this encourages us to cry unto Him as an entirepeople, with united voice. And that we may do this in a propermanner we have felt led to set apart the next anniversary of the 
 President Woodruff said he hadoften heard of surprise partiesand had attended some and thiswas one of them, for he was filledwith surprise to hear the rollcall answered by his own sayingsand writings, and doubted wheth-er he could have answered withone himself, had his name beencalled. Was pleased with theexercises of the evening andthought it our duty to understandthe principles of our holy relig-ion for this was the greatest dis-pensation ever given to man.Joseph Smith with the excep-tion of Jesus Christ, who was theson of the Highest, was the greatest prophet that ever lived.This dispensation was the be-ginning of the end of the world.The Prophet Joseph was chosenin the eternal worlds to lay thefoundation of this work and thatthe foundation was perfect in every detail. The ordinance of"Salvation for the dead" was oneof its most important principlesand it requires the inspiration ofGod to comprehend it. He heardthis revelation from the mouth ofthe prophet Joseph himself. Ourdead are watching us, and wehave it in our power to carry sal-vation to them, and if we neglect 
 A Tribune reporter yesterday after-noon called on President Wilford Woodruff for the purpose of interview-ing him relative to the disturbance caused by Democratic leaders over therecent priesthood meeting. The ven-erable head of the Mormon church had,however, already prepared a statementfor publication, which is as follows:To All Whom it May Concern:Inasmuch as there has been so much written and said concerning the pro-ceedings of a priesthood meeting held in the Assembly hall on Monday, the 7th day of October, I feel it my dutyto make a statement concerning it.I consider it the right of every man, woman and child on earth to enjoy their religion, let that religion be whatit may, for that is between themselvesand their Creator. So I say with re-gard to politics. Every man has a right to enjoy his political beilef un-molested, let this be what it may. There is not a Democrat in Utah Ter-ritory who can truthfully say that I ever asked him to vote a Republican ticket, or join the Republican party.Neither can any Republican say that Iever asked him to vote a Democraticticket, or join the Democrats.A part of my own family are Repub-licans and part are Democrats. I havenever counseled one of them to changehis politics. They are, all of them, strong, independent men, and they en-joy their freedom without any inter-ference of their father.Now, concerning that meeting re-ferred to, there was not, according tomy recollection, one word said about Democrats, Republicans or politics. Joseph F. Smith's remarks were uponthe same subject that the Apostleshad taught through the conferenceto ten thousand people.When the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-Day Saints was organized, it was with the holy priesthood in itsvarious orders and quorums. And when a man was appointed to theApostleship or Presidency, or in anyoffice, as a teacher of the people, it placed him in a very grave responsi-bility. And no man was counted atliberty, from the organization of the church, to engage in any branch ofbusiness, politics, or anything else to take him entirely away from his call-ing, business, duty or responsibility fora length of time, without first coun-seling with the Presidency of the church, or with his quorum, on its pro-priety, and getting permission to do so. And this order has rested upon us all alike. And this has been my positionfor sixty years of my life, and that, too, without interfering with my man-hood. And this course does not re-quire a man to give up his position inthe Democratic party or in the Re-publican.Several Democrats have called uponme since this campaign commenced. Among the number was my friend,John T. Caine, saying he had beennominated for Governor. I said, "Go ahead. I think you will make a goodGovernor." I think so still.Every man has his own free agency.  He has the right to withdraw from his quorum, or the church, if he wishes. But while he remains in his quorum, or in the church, we think heshould be subject to the same rulesthat we are ourselves. But that dutydoes not require any man to withdrawfrom the Democratic or Republicanparty, or give up his polical princi-ples.WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 On the afternoon of Saturday, October 8th, an Epistle fromPresident Wilford Woodruff, in behalf of the Twelve Apos-tles, was read by Bishop Orson F. Whitney, the following be-ing a brief synopsis of it:As some of the Apostles areprevented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, fromappearing in public, the Church will naturally look forsome expression from them concerning their feelings and hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at the pre-sent time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles,because of the loss which the Church has sustained in theDeath of President John Taylor.Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its Presi-dent, and each time the event has produced a profoundimpression upon its members. In this instance thissad event is invested with more significance than itwould have been had it occurred in the ordinary wayPresident Taylor died in exile.For about two years and a half he had been compelledto live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public as-sociation with the people whom he loved more than hislife.Through his decease the Church is called the third time tomourn the departure of the man who has stood as its Presi-dent and as the Prophet, Seer and Revealator to this genera-tion. The experience which the Saints have gained in pass-ing through these trials has been of exceeding value to them.They have learned that God can take care of His own work, andthat they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning its management.For some time before his death the Prophet Joseph was in-spired of the Lord to anticipate his own departure from earth-ly scenes. This was shown in various ways; but especially inthe great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon theTwelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priest-

 birthday of the Prophet Joseph Smithâ€”December 23rd,â€”as a dayof fasting and of solemn prayer unto the Lord.It is for this end that we address this circular to you, that all the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains may be informed that the daymentioned is designated and set apart as a day of general fasting andprayer for the whole Church, and that the Saints may assemble at theirvarious meeting houses and devote the day to prayer to Almighty God in behalf of Zion.We need not describe at any length the reasons there are for making in this united appeal to our Great Creator. They are familiar to youand to all the people. It is easy to perceive that we are menacedwith a total deprivation of our rights as free men and as citizens,because we are members of the Church of the Lamb of God. Lookwhich way we will and there appears no earthly help of which we can avail ourselves. But we can turn to the Lord in per-fect confidence that he will hear and help us.^*Circulars [beginning] at were furnished the Bishops, Presidents of Prayer Circles, and a few other brethren^*We think the fast should be from sundown on Sunday, the 22nd, to sundown on Monday, the 23rd, covering a period oftwenty-four hours.^Was not in the Bishop's Etc Circulars^We desire you to take immediate steps to notify the Bishopsand their Counselors, and other presiding officers in your Stakes, ofthe appointment of this Fast Day, that it may be known to all the Saints of your Stakes.^In Cirular^All labor that can be dispensed with should be suspended on that day, and the people should assemble themselvesâ€”men, womenand childrenâ€”and humble themselves before the Lord, andcall upon Him in mighty prayer to look with mercy andtender compassion upon the people of His Church.Among other subjects for which we should pray on the Fast Day,now set apart, the following should not be forgotten:We should pray for the plots and the schemes which are beingframed for the purpose of robbing us of our civil and political rightsand of obtaining control of our cities, counties and Territory, to beconfounded, and their authors to be thwarted in their evil designs.We should pray for all who conspire, in any manner, to injure ordestroy the work of God, or take from the people their rights and lib-erties, to be defeated in their wicked purposes.We should pray for the unfavorable action of courts and officialsto be overruled in such a manner that no injury will be done to Zion.We should pray for the Executive of our nation, for the Cabinet, theSenate, the House of Representatives, the Judiciary and the people ofour nation to be so influence and controlled that their hearts willbe softened towards the people of God, and that they may not 
 this duty we shall meet withbitter reproaches when we meetthem on the other side. TheLord had the element of powerto carry on this work and Hewould raise up choice spirits tobear it off triumphantly. Thislabor is necessary but it can nev-er be fully understood until wereach the spirit world, but we understand sufficient to accom-plish a great deal. We havebeen reserved in the spirit worldto come forth and participate in this glorious work. The dutiesof the different associations arevery great. The young men and women should be taught that itis a calamity to marry outside ofthe Church, and if they under-stood the gospel thoroughly theywould never do it. No peopleupon the earth had laboredharder to accomplish God's pur-poses than the Latter-day Saints.It is the privilege of every indi-vidual to receive revelation forhis own guidance. He would have been in the spirit worldlong ago but for listening to the whisperings of the still smallvoice, which is a key to guide usaright. At the dedication of theSalt Lake Temple he was stronglyimpressed that from that timeangels would go forth from God's presence and execute judgmentupon the wicked and reap intheir midst as with a sickle.God had withheld these calami-ties until many of the just weregathered. His judgments werenow abroad in the earth in variedforms, and this was only the be-ginning. He asked God's bless-ing upon the audience. 
 HIS PURPOSEPresident Woodruff Dis-cusses His PoliticalAddress.WHAT HE HAD IN VIEWHe Says He Spoke as a Bur-dened Taxpayer.ATTITUTE TOWARD PARTIES.He States that He is in Favor of theContinuance of Present Party Di-visions, Except in City Affairsâ€”HeDid not Mean to Say that thereShould not be Partisanship inState Electionsâ€”Claims the Rightto Speak on Political Questions,not as the Head of the MormonChurch, but as a Citizenâ€”This waswhat He Meant, He Says, WhenHe Declared that the Time hadCome When His Mouth Should notbe Closed on Political Mattersâ€”HisAddress Caused Much Discussionand Bitter Condemnationâ€”GeorgeQ. Cannon's Position.In response to questions asked by aTribune reporter, President Woodruffyesterday discussed his conference ad-dress on politics. He entered into anexplanation of his object in making theaddress and his purpose in using thelanguage which has caused such a sen-sation. He was first asked:PURPOSE OF THE ADDRESS."What purpose did you have in viewin giving your people this political ad-vice?""I had in mind," said PresidentWoodruff, "the financial condition ofour city and the heavy taxation itsproperty owners are bearing. I knowhow heavy it is from my own experi-ence. On the Valley house property,which I own, I say from $1200 to $1500taxes a year, and my income from the Valley house is but $50 per month. Iget but little revenue from the balanceof the property. I talked as a tax-payer to other taxpayersâ€”not as thehead of the Mormon church to Mor-mons. I felt that the time had comewhen there should be a change in theway of managing our city affairs, sothat we might have officials who wouldnot be merely after the loaves andfishes."WHAT HE ADVISED."Did you mean to advise Mormons tocease being Republicans and Demo-crats?""No, I did not. I am in favor of par-ties. I wanted the people to work forthe election of good men to our cityoffices. That was all. I did not advisethe election of Mormons to office. I amanxious for the election of men,whether Mormons or non-Mormons, whowill manage our city affairs economi-cally. I do not wish my remarks to beunderstood as applying to people of ourchurch only. As a citizen and tax-payer, I desire all good citizens to unitefor the election of good officers."CITY NON-PARTISANSHIP."But what method of union did youhave in mind? Did you mean that Re-publicans should work within theirparty lines to elect good Republicansand Democrats within their party toelect good Democrats?""I did not care how they did it, solong as they voted for good men. ButI spoke especially with reference tonon-partisanship in city affairsâ€”not tothe present non-partisan movement,but to non-partisanship in general. Ifelt that the experience of the cityshowed that it would be better not tohave party spirit control in our cityoffices, but that the city's affairs shouldbe managed in a business way."AS TO TICKETS."Is it true, as claimed, that yourpurpose was to direct your churchmembers to vote the Non-Partisanticket?""I did not refer to any ticket. I did not have any particular ticket in mind. I have not had time to paymuch attention to tickets. I was sim-ply advocating the prinicple of non-partisanship in city matters. I haveno desire to pitch into Republicansand Democrats. I think parties areneeded, as a general thing. I spokespontaneously, and did not mean tosay that there should be non-partisan-ship in State and National affairs. Imeant that we should elect good mento all offices, but it was about cityofficers that I was thinking when Iurged people to unite regardless ofparty. I had in mind particularly ourheavy city debts and expenses. I want it to be clearly understood that Ido not want to break up the parties.I want them to exist here. I have nointention to urge that they be brokenaway from in State affairs. It wouldnot be wise to do away with ourpresent party lines."SPEAKS OF HIS RIGHTS."What did you mean by saying thatthe time had come when the mouths ofthe church authorities should not beclosed as to politics?""I meant that we had the right toexpress our views as citizens. It hasbeen claimed, not only by people out-side of the church, but by Mormonsas well, that the higher church officersshould be silent in political matters.But I differ from them. As Presidentof the Mormon church I claim no rightto dictate to any one in politics. WhenI speak on political matters I speaksimply as a citizen, interested in thewelfare of the people. I feel that Ihave a right, as an individual Ameri-can citizen, to speak on political ques-tions. I don't think that any man, be-cause he is a priest, has any right todictate in politics. But I claim that aMormon priest has as much right tospeak of political matters as has aMethodist or a Baptist minister or aCatholic priest. He has no right,however, to use his priesthood to in-fluence people politically, and I haveno intention of using mine for thatpurpose."

 President Woodruff's personal testimony.I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last man living in theflesh who was present upon that occasion feel it a duty I owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, tothe House of Isreal, and to the whole world to bear this mylast testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4,Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostlestogether in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many dayswith us in giving us our endowments, and teaching usthose glorious principles which God had revealed to him.And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in ourmidst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great andlast dispensation which God had set His hand to perform up-on the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if withconsuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with muchof the power of God, and his face shone and was transpar-ently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgottenin time or eternity, with the following language:"Brethern, I have had great sorrow of heart for fear that I might betaken from the earth with the keys of the Kindom of God upon me, with-out sealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed uponmy head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing andbuilding up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth,and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now bre-thern, I thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled to give you your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your headsall the powers of the Aaronic and Melchisedek Priesthoods and Apos-tleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed uponme; and I now roll off all the labor, burden and care of this Churchand Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now command youin the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, andbear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, andbefore God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned"And the same spirit that filled the room at that time burnsin my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophetof God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to standat the head of the Church and direct its affairs.

 THE WAR WITH SPAIN.Letter on the Subject from the First Presi-dency to Governor Wellsâ€”Latter-day SaintsShould Respond with Alacrity to the Gov-ernment's Call.Executive Office.Salt Lake City, Utah, April 28, 1898.To the Editor:I am in receipt of the accompanying let-ter from the First Presidency of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints, which I should be pleased tohave you publish.Very Respectfully,HEBER M. WELLS, Govenor.Office of the First Presidency of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Salt Lake City, Utah,April 28, 1898.Hon. Heber M. Wells, Governor of theState of Utah:Dear Governorâ€”We have read withmuch interest your proclamation to thepeople of our State, in which you call,in response to the proclamation of thePresident of the United States, for theenlistment of 500 men to furnish Utah'squota of the 125,000 volunteers calledfor by the President to serve in thearmy of the United States for twoyears.The people whom we represent arelovers of peace, and would do anythingin their power, consistent with honorand the patriotic duty which every citi-zen owes to his country, to avert war,and its dreadful train of consequences.Because of this feeling we have beenled to admire to course which hasbeen taken by President McKinleythroughout this Spanish imbroglio, andwe have hoped that his effort to pre-serve peace between the two countrieswould result in success.But war has been declared, and wehave it to meet. Our citizens are calledupon to enlist, and Utah is asked tofurnish cavalry and batteries of artil-lery approximating 500 men.We trust that the citizens of Utahwho are Latter-day Saints will befound ready to respond with alacrityto this call which is made upon ourState. There was a time in the pastwhen we were called upon, as a re-ligious organization, to make a fargreater sacrifice than this, under cir-cumstances that were exceedingly painful. Then there was no hesita-tion; but upwards of one-third of themen of suitable age formed a battal-ion of 500, left the camp and vol-unteered to take part in the Mexicanwar. In like manner there should beno hesitation now; and we sincerelytrust that your recruiting officers willfind our co-religionists as ready nowto enlist and march to the defense oftheir country as their fathers were in the days to which we refer.Trusting that you will be eminentlysuccessful in raising Utah's properquota of volunteers, and praying thatthe Almighty will protect our nation inthe hour of trial and assist us in ourbattles for humanity and right, weremain. Very respectfully,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO. Q. CANNON,JOS. F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints. 
 be inclined to listen to the slanderous reports and falsehoods which are circulated concerning us, and which may be brought before them; and that allthe officers of our nation may be inspired with such wisdom, justice and mer-cy that they will fill their stations so as to gain the love and esteem of the peopleand the approbation of the Lord.In the event of the decision of the Supreme Court not being rendered before the Fast Day concerning our property which has been seized, we shouldpray to the Lord to so move upon the hearts of the Judges that they will bestrengthened and filled with courage, so as to render a righteous decision.We should pray for the Lord to soften the hearts of the people of our nation,and to open their eyes that they may see us in our true light and be in-clined to treat us with that kindness and consideration which are due tofellow citizens who are loyal and true in upholding the Constitution ofour great country.We should pray for the Lord to come to our help and to deliver us fromthe many snares that are spread around us for our overthrow and des-truction; to make our path plain before us; to lead us so that we may es-cape from the pits that are dug for our feet.We should pray that the Lord will pour out in great power His HolySpirit and the gifts thereof upon His servants, that every man may befilled with the qualifications and power which are necessary to enablehim to magnify his office acceptably before the Lord; and that He willfill the hearts of His Saints with comfort and peace, and witness unto themthat He has not forgotten and does not neglect Zion.Of course, there are many other blessings that can be prayed for. Butwe feel to mention these as being subjects that are prominent in ourminds, and to which our attention is called at the present time, and for which we ourselves exercise faith before the Lord.In closing, we suggest to yourselves and the Saints that howevermuch we may feel aggrieved at the acts of men towards us, weshould not pray for their condemnation. Let us confess ourown sins and pray that we may be forgiven for them, and leaveother sinners to the Lord, who has said that judgment is His, andHe will repay.-[End of Circular furnished the Bishops Etc Etc]-Praying to the Lord that He will fill you and the Saints un-der your presidency with His Holy Spirit and give unto you the spirit of faith and prayer.We remain, your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 (2)utterly destitute of reason and sense as to fail to be perceive hisinconsistency and falsehood, ^he^ having told them two stories, both ofwhich cannot possibly be true. An apostate, of the name ofParrott stirs the Elders up occasionally by raising a mob when-ever he can to annoy them and to disturb our meetings. He gaveme a chariavari early in January, while visiting Bristolto attend a Conference; but he did not succeed in interrupt-ing our proceedings or in preventing us from enjoying ourselves.Since then, he has paid Elder Bramall and the Saints in South-ampton a visit and issued handbills of an exciting and in-flammatory character, and has delivered public lectures againstus for the avowed purpose of interfering with an putting astop to all our labors in this country. One of his handbills isheaded "One Hundred Guineas Reward" to Bro. Bramalland some others of the Elders and myself, if we will meet himand prove our doctrines true upon a certain night, named inthe placard. That night he had a large audience in expecta-tion of a discussion; but there being nobody there to meet him,and the people being disappointed in seeing the fun whichthey expected, they left as many as twenty at a time and atthe conclusion of his lecture there were scarcely any present.He disgusts every decent person who goes to hear him, and thoughhe succeeded in obtaining a "Reverend" for his chairman inhis first lectures he became so ashamed of his connexion withParrott, that he left him. I counselled Bro. Bramall torefrain from noticing him in the least. He and the Saintshave adopted this policy and thus far it has been attendedwith the happiest results.

He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op,when it came to Sunset it all came in one boxIndigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils,school books &c. all mixed ^together^ in one compound. Therehas been something wrong with almost every pieceof machinery sent for, last spring they sent to ZC. M. I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawsonwho sent a small one horse mill with some partsmissing when it arrived. It was entirely toosmall for their use and last of all though notleast they wanted to start a tannery had theirvats in place and tanner and materials allon hand, they wanted a bark mill and sentmoney by Bro Flake and when he arrivedat Beaver he not going to Salt Lake requestedthe Beaver Co-op, who is dealing with the ZC. M. I. to send for a bark mill for the SunsetTannery. Bro Smith had to send an extrateam to the ferry to bring it but when it arrivedbehold! and Lo! it turned out to be a littlegiant, a corn-cob mill and not suitablefor grinding bark at all, now all has to waituntil a bal^r^k mill can be bought at StLouis, brought to the terminns by vail and then freighted from there by way of Albuquer-que. Now is not this enough to try the patienceof Saints? to say nothing about sinners, I thinkit is. I think that persons living as far fromSalt Lake as these settlements are who wish topatronize their own Institutions and pay down should have a little care and painstaken for them and not make such blundersas have been made towards them. The peopleof this country do not think that Bro Clawsonhas done them justice. They did not know

He said he was a missionary sent overby the "New Organization of the Church" under young Joseph.IMy reply was, that he could not have that privilege. He thoughtI was not as fair with him as we wished others to be withusâ€”that we asked others for the privilege of preaching in theirhalls, but would not grant him ours for such a purpose. Itold him, that I would feel very differently were he an honestsectarian, who wished to set forth his views in sincerity; buthe, himself, had once known the truth and had apostatized fromit, and those who sent him where in the same condition, andI knew they were neither honest nor sincere. I knew theirhistory well, and knew them to be base, bad men. He said Iwas afraid of the truth, and feared investigation. I repliedthat I knew the truth, and that there was no need at thislate hour to investigate the claims of such fellows as he,for we had learned it through long years of sad experience.He then wanted to know, (though he prefaced his requestby the remark that he thought I would not grant it) if Iwould publish the "General Epistle of President Joseph Smith."I told him of course I would not. He then left. On ^the^ Sundaymorning following I found him esconsed in a seat in onecorner of the chapel, when I went in. After I got through speaking

 (4)he rose, and requested the privilege of making some re-marks. I repeated my refusal, and as he was disposed tobe pertinacious, I told him that if he did not sit down im-mediately I should put him in charge of a police officer. Atthat he caved. After meeting he came up to me and saidthat it was the weight of his responsibility under which hewas laboring which induced him to rise. I replied that itwas just such a responsibility as the Devil had ever felt. Heevidently intended to arouse, if possible, a feeling of sympathyin the minds of the people in his favor, but he failed mostsignally, and when he was compelled to sit down I caughtsight of an expression on his face of baffled and disappointedhate. Not knowing where he might direct his steps I wrote acircular to the Presiding Elders throughout the mission, puttingthem on their guard against the insidious approaches of such"wolves in sheeps' clothing." I warned them particularly againstpermitting themselves, or any of the Elders and Saints undertheir jurisdiction, bto be drawn into a arg discussuion with thisman or any others with similar pretensions, telling them toadopt the let-them-alone-severely policy. I learn by letterfrom Elder Mills, that he was at West Bromwich last Sunday,in company with some old apostates, and arose to "say a wordby way of bearing testimony," but they ^(the brethren)^ had been put upontheir guard by the counsel which had been given, and theywould allow no such thing. After meeting he wanted to speak, and attempted to inweigh against Polygamy. TheDoctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon and the Bible wereabout to be appealed to, when the brethren told him to desistat once, and they ordered the room to be cleared, as meeting was over. It was in this town where he married his wife before he

 (5)emigrated to the Valley. He has been shown no quarters, how-ever, by any of our people, and will, I am confident, do us moregood in the end than harm. I felt to predict this when Ifirst knew of his arrival. My teachings to the Elders and Saintshave been, not to descend from the dignity of their positions toargue and hold controversy, neither with the Devil nor withthose filled with his Spirit; nothing can be gained, I have toldthem, by reasoning with apostates, men who have known the Truthand denied it and forfeited the Spirit of the Lord and yielded them-selves up to the spirit of the Evil One. I have a thoroughand deep grounded dislike to these miserable liars and covenantbreakersâ€”so many of whom are to be found within the boundsof this "New Organization." They are a base crew of malignant,bloodthirsty creatures who were so corrupt years ago, that theycould not bear to see holiness and purity and virtue exist em-bodied in human nature, and therefore sought to shed the bloodof those who cherished these principles. I regret greatly thantany of the children or relatives of our beloved prophet should beconnected in any way with such a crowd, many of whom soughtand rejoiced over the death of their father. I feel convinced,however, that circumstances are being so overruled that they,or at least a portion of them, will yet have their eyes open tosee their true position and where alone they can find the truefriends of their father and family. It is my prayer that theymay be thus enlightened.[redacted] wrote me a very humble letter from[redacted] I can scarcely reconcile its contents and the Spiritit breathes with the fact of the girl's confession at [redacted] 
 (6)that she had been seduced by him. I mention this letterto you now, because in my last letter to you, I informed youthat he had denied having done any wrong with any personin the Church, yet this girl had testified that he had ruinedher, and as I have not seen the girl, myself, I wish himto have the benefit of the doubt in your minds which hispenitent letter has rasied in mine.Unless some counsel should come from the President to thecontrary, I expect a number of the Valley Elders will be releasedthis Spring to return home. They feel very pleased at the pros-pect of so soon enjoying the society of their families and theSaints of God. The saints are very desirous to get away thisSpring; already applications from all quarters have commencedflowing in to me to know if I cannot extend them a littlehelp to get away, some lacking more and some less money,and these applications will increase very rapidly as the timeof emigration appro^a^ches. As yet, I have received no intima-tion from Brother Brigham respecting the sending down ofTeams to the Frontiers to carry up the poor, and as I do notlike to make any very definite moves, or to stir the peopleup very much upon the subject of Emigration until thatarrives, we feel considerably anxious to receive some word.The people from Scandinavia are intending to come by way ofLiverpool this Season instead of via Hamburg as they didlast. We think the advantages are greater by this than the otherroute. The Work is prospering there and numbers are beingadded. In many Conferences, in this Mission also, the laborsof the Elders are being attended with marked success. 
 (7)Brother John L. Smith is pursuing a very wise and savingcourse towards the Saints and the people within the limits ofhis mission. When everthing is considered I think the Eldersthere have done and are doing remarkably well. In FranceBro. Bertrand has many grave difficulties to contend with,which prevent him from being as successful in his laborsas he otherwise would be. He does not appear to get discouragedor to give up trying, and occasionally baptizes a few. I proposedto him, when I was in Paris, in view of his lengthy absence fromhome and the almost ^utter^ indifference of the people to the messageof which he is the bearer, to return home this season; but leftit with himself to decide. He has since expressed a wishto remain another year. The Holland Mission, I think frompresent appearances, will have to be abandoned. You willdoubtless recollect that Elders Vander Woude and Paul A.Schettler were appointed ^a^ missions to Holland in theSpring of (18)61. For some time after their arrival they had butlittle succeess, and Bro. Vander Woude wrote some very dis-couraging letters here, in which he evinced but very little faith.Money had to be sent there to sustain them, and as I had noauthority to thus use funds I mentioned the matter in a letterto the President. He counselled the withdrawal of the Elders,if they people would not receive their message. In the mean-time, however, they had baptized a few, and as prospectsappeared brighter we thought it better to let them try a little longer. As I had learned that there was difficulty in theBranch they had raised up I thought it better to visit them towhile I was on the Continent, and concluded it would be 
 (8)wise to separate the Elders and remove Bro. Schettlerto labor with Bro. John L. Smith, who was much in need ofhis help, and with whom he could labor with greater pleasureand harmony than where he was. I investigated the difficulty,and though the principal opponent of Bro. Vander Woudeevidently had a bad spirit, yet Bro. Vander Woude's coursehad been a very unwise one. The latter promised to do bet-ter and the difficulty was settled, only, however, to breakout with greater violence, as I have since learned. Oneobject that I supposed would be gained by the removalof Bro. Schettler would be that the Branch, as I was inform-ed by them, would be able to sustain Bro. Vander Wonde; butI have since learned that they refuse to sustain himâ€”thatis, those of them who have the meansâ€”and I have been com-pelled to forward him money to keep him from suffering.As I have no hopes respecting his accomplishing anythingin that country I have deemed it better to release him toreturn home in the Spring. I think that the right kind ofman might do good in that country, but it is without doubt,I think, a hard field.Bros Bigler and West still travel through the missionand their labors are attended with very good effects.Accept my love to yourselves, individually, and to yourfamilies in which my wife joins. Praying the Lord tofill you with his Holy Spirit and to endow you with thepower of your Apostleship and to preserve your lives longupon the earthI remain, as ever,Your Brother,Geo. Q. Cannon

 President Wilford Woodruff spoke for a short time upon the many blessings enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints; the entrance of the Pioneers to the valley of Salt Lake, and the marvilous manifestions of the power of God over His people since the organization of the Church up to the present time. The speaker dwelt on the responsibil-ities resting upon this people, and concluded by urgingthem to keep their live true to their religion, and so fulfilthe commandments of the Lord that when they had finished theircourse here below, He would be satisfied with their work. 
 President Wilford Woodruff next spoke. He gave a briefsketch of his connection with the Church from the time ofhis baptism in the year 1833, when he was ordained a Teacherand told of the thousands of miles he had traveled in thecause of the Gospel. Every man in Israel who bore a portionof the Priesthood should understand as far as he could the im-portance of that calling, for the exercises of the Priesthood wereinseparably connected with the heavens. They were called uponin this last dispensation and fulness of times to establish theZion and Church of God, to go forth among every nation underheaven and bear the Gospel to the people, so far as the doors wereopen unto them. They had been laboring as a Church andpeople for the last 60 years, and during that time had preachedthe Gospel to millions on the face of the earth, as well as gatheredhundreds of thousands into these mountain valleys and intothe fold of Christ. The speaker warmly counseled the Eldersof quorums to be true and faithful in their calling and tobe regular in their attendance in the various meetings; dwelton the subject of prayer, and predicted that this great latter-daywork would stand firmly until the coming of the Son ofMan, which was not a long way off. Speaking on thesubject of Temples, he expressed the hope, his life havingbeen spared thus far by the providence of God, that he wouldlive to see the dedication of the Temple on this ground.He thanked the Lord that he was still in the midst ofthe Latter-day Saints, and rejoiced in the fact that theLord had raised up this people in fulfilment of theprophecies contained in the Bible. President Wood-ruff touched upon the duties and obligations of the Saints,individually and collectively, dwelt briefly upon thework abroad and upon the confistication of the Churchproperty by the Government of the United States. Despiteall the difficulties which had surrounded this Church,they had been able to progress and would continue un-til the winding-up scene.

 Salt Lake City, Utah, May 9th 1893.President Angus M Cannon and Counselors,Salt Lake Stake of Zion.Dear Brethren:With this we return the recommends given by you tomembers of your Stake to be present at the dedicatory services at theTemple. We do so for the purpose that you may carefully examinethem and become acquainted with the standing of the persons recom-mended. There were numbers who gained admission to these serviceswhose lives had, for many years, been inconsistent with their calling asSaints: in fact, in some cases they were not known to be members of theChurch. But their names were found on the records, fellowship had notbeen withdrawn from them, and they claimed the right, under the rulingof the First Presidency, to be present at the dedication. These personshaving claimed this privilege by reason of their membership in theChurch, it now becomes the duty of the local authorities, Bishops andothers, to see that all such assume the responsibilities of their profes-sion. When, in your search through the recommends, you meetthe name of any of whose standing you are in doubt, they should belabored with in the divine spirit of love and patience, and be admon-ished to repent of all that is unseemly and inconsistent with their call-ings as officers or members of Christ's Holy Church. If any turn adeaf ear to these warnings, continue in ways of indifference or sin, andthey be found unworthy of membership, they should be dealt with by the proper councils of the Church, as the word of the Lord directs, andtheir names should be stricken from the records, that the vineyardof the Lord may be pruned and no further opportunity given to the unworthy to repeat the course they took to gain admission to the Temple services.Our Heavenly Father having exercised His right to forgive,and to say to each one of us, "Son (or daughter) thy sins be forgiventhee," on condition that we forsake our sins and live unto 
 Official Announcement.Salt Lake City, August 18, 1894.To the Officers and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:Dear Brethren and Sisters:For several years past, the Presiding Authorities of the Church, acting inconjunction with the General Board of Education, have operated toward the estab-lishment of a Church University, this institution to become the head of our ChurchSchool System, and to be equipped for the work of higher instruction. Duringthe past two years, steps were taken toward founding and endowing such aninstitution as would meet the needs of the people of Utah, and particularlyof the Latter-day Saints, as a denominational school of high grade; and on the 8thof September, 1893, a circular was issued announcing the opening of the ChurchUniversity.The work of the institution was conducted during the academicyear 1893â€“4, with abundant proofs of success; and all connected with the manage-ment of the Church University had reason to anticipate for the school a brilliantfuture.There was no intention on the part of the promoters of the ChurchUniversity to arouse any unfair competition or rivalry between that schooland the University of Utah; nevertheless, the existance of two institutions inthe same city, with many courses in common, rendered the paralleling of work,and the consequent duplication of expenditure, absolutely unavoidable. Timehas very plainly demonstrated the fact that Utah, while abundantly able underpresent conditions to maintain one well equipped institution for higherinstruction, cannot adequately support many such, either in material sup-plies of means, or in students prepared for university courses of study.After due consideration of the presents conditions and future pro[s]pects ofeducational affairs in Utah, the presiding quorums of the Church have deemedit wise to bring the work of the Church University to a close, that greater energy,resulting from concentration of effort, may devoted to the development of ourTerritorial University.Toward the University of Utah our people mayproperly indulge a feeling of pride; the institution was established in theearly days of Utah's history; it was incorporated, indeed, under the nameof the University of Deseret within less than three years after the first settlement ofthis region.It has grown in spite of the numerous difficulties incidentto pioneer existance, to its present fair proportions, and to the attainment of itsforty-fifth year, with a steady and healthful progress which inspires strongconfidence for its future.Utah has need of such an institution of learning;indeed there appears no reason why our University should not become the greatinter-mountain center for the diffusion of knowledge in advanced and special-ized branches.We hope that the day is not far distant when the youth of 
 AN ADDRESSTo the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:Dear Brethren and Sistersâ€”It has been a practice in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to fast and pray, and in this manner to seek for that faith which Saints should possess, and obtain that spirit of humility which we are commanded to cultivate.Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the first Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting and prayer. The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day their contributations for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the wardAt the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient for the people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that day. Theconditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and employed,could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the worship of the Lord.For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to beartheir testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the direction of the bishopric.As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more difficult for the people generally, and especially those in steady employ-ment, to attend these meetings, until at the present time they havedwindled to such an extent that comparatively few have the oppor-tunity of attending them. Thursday as a day of fasting and prayerin the Church no longer serves the object for which it was intended.Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature deliberation, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been devoted to this purpose. Instead of the customary assemblages in the various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day for the regular fast meeting.Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the direction of the Presidents of the Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever it can be done conveniently, and devotethe meeting to the administration of the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi-mony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the confirming of members in the Church, and to such other services ashave usually been attended to at such meetings. We feel assuredthat excellent results will follow the giving of members of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seekfor the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep Hiscommandments.Care should should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wantsof the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf,that no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land 
 President Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference.He read from Romans, chapter VIII. He followed upon the irres-istible purposes of God, and the necessity of the Saints living in accordance with them; the need of understanding the signs of times; the importance of present duties, teaching children to pray, the necessity of union, and the need of learning and appreciating the great missionentrusted to the Latter-day Saints. 
 To The Saints.To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in General Conference assembled:Dear Brethren and Sistersâ€”Every Latter-day Saint will recognize the value of union, not only in action but in matters of faith and discipline.As to the rights and authority of the Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of the highest importance that there should be no difference of opinion amongthe officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

 "Office ofThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter day SaintsSalt Lake City, Utah, Dec 18, 1895.Prest. Angus M Cannon,Salt Lake StakeDear Brother:At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of Apostles, held onThursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions were reached, and are now presented for theguidance of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops and their associate officers, and all whom theymay concern.There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes of Zion, of High Priests,Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have been called to act in the capacity of Teachers,having an organization, distinct from that of the Teachers Quorum, and being presidedover by a president and two counselors. The tendency of such organizations has been toassume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or quorums of the priesthood.The question submitted was, Is it proper for such organizations to exist, or to be presid-ed over in this manner? The Council felt that it was not proper, as no provisionis made for them in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church govern-ment; neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided thatthe brethren who bear the Melchisedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers, shouldnot have a separate president and counselors, but that they should, when actingin this capacity, be presided over directly by the Bishopric, whose aids they arein all things connected with the well-being of the ward.The second question was: At which of the meetings of the Saints should personsguilty of unchastity be required to make confessionâ€”at the general meeting of the 
 Him in newness of life, it would be well not to impose furtherconditions or to require that any of the Saints should be re-baptized before they can be recognized as in full fellowship;on the other hand, none should be forbidden to, in this way, renewtheir covenants, if they feel that by so doing they will more fully satisfytheir consciences, or will receive thereby renewed strength to commencea life more faithful in the observance of God's commandments.We desire that the Presidents of quorums should act in harmonywith the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops. They should examine therolls of their quorums and where they find men entirely neglecting theduties of their Priesthood and ignoring its responsibilities, they shouldtake the usual action therein.Praying the Lord to bless you with His Holy Spirit, not only incarrying out these instructions, but at all times and under allcircumstances,We remain, your Brethren in ChristWilford WoodruffGeo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. SmithFirst Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints.P.S.â€”We send you a number of extra copies of this circular fordistribution among the Bishops and Presidents of Quorums in yourStake." 
 Utah will not longer need to journey afar in search of professional instruction;but that our own State will offer her sons and daughters ample facilities inall departments of intellectual progress.We recommend to the Latter-day Saints that they faithfully devote their in-fluence and energy, such as might have been claimed by the University of the Church, had wisdom dictated the continuance of that institution, to the Universityof Utah.We trust that our people will sustain the Territorial University bytheir good words and works, and particularly by their patronage in sending thithertheir sons and daughters who are prepared to become students in the institution,which by law is constituted as the head of the public school system of Utah.The officers of the University are men in whom the people have learned torepose their confidence; the Chancellor and the Regents need no encomiumsfrom us in their responsible and honorable stations. The President andFaculty of the institution are severally of recognized abilities in their professions,and of steadfast devotion to the educational advancement of the people; they areentitled to the fullest confidence of Utah's citizens without distinction.We feel assured that the moral influence of the University will prove of salu-tary effect, and all due attention will be paid to the training of students in thestudies of true moral citizenship as well as in the subjects of purely secularinstruction.However, as the University is a public possession, the proprietyof people of many sects and creeds, it would be manifestly improper to allowany species of sectarian religious instruction to be imparted within its walls,or under its auspices.In view of these facts, and knowing, as we do, that manyof the Latter-day Saints are imbued with a strong desire to have their youthinstructed in theological tenets co-ordinately with secular training, we call your atten-tion to the fact that the Latter-day Saints' College, an institution which standsamong the foremost of our Church Schools, is conducted in close proximity to theUniversity, and that the very full courses of daily instruction in Theologywill be offered at such hours, and under such conditions, that Latter-day Saintstudents who are attending the University, and others not regularly attendingthe College, may pursue in the latter such of these sacred studies as theirability and opportunities will permit. It is the aim of our local and gener-al educational boards to strengthen the theological department of the College, increas-ing and augmenting the courses, to meet all requirements.We request that the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops of Wards, and otherpresiding officers, will cause this letter to be read in their places of publicgathering; and that they will use their influence in otherwise bringing thissubject before the people.Respectfully your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F SmithFirst Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. 
 members of the ward, at the Fast Meeting, or the Monthly Priesthood Meeting?It was the mind of the Council that the regulation of confessions in suchcases should be left to the Bishopric of the Ward in which the wrong-doingoccurs; and that each case be considered on its merits, and disposed ofaccording to the publicity which has been given to it. For instance, wherepeople guilty of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their trans-gression is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public.But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made beforethe priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood meeting; or, if itbe deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a still more public confession shouldbe made, it shall mean that the confession shall be made at the monthlyFast Meeting (which meetings are attended almost, if not, exclusively bychurch members) and that in no case shall confessions be made at theregular Sunday services.The object of this restriction is to confine the confession as muchas possible to the circle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and to avoidspreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation, which says(Doc & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in a meeting, andthat not before the world."As a rule, therefore, where the knowledge of transgression is knownto but a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made atthe priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has becomea public scandal and reproach to the church should the more publicconfession be made.We areYour Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo Q. CannonJos F. Smith." 
 in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.In Salt Lake City, instead of the people meeting in the Taberna-cle on the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for the Latter-day Saints to meet in their several wards on that after-noon, so as to give all the members of the ward, including the aged and infirm, and others who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an opportunity to participate in the fast meeting and share in the blessings of the occasion. In other Stakes where general meetingsare held as in this city, we suggest that they also be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meet in their places of worship in the several wards.In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast to omit eating breakfast. This is not in accordance with the viewsand practice of the past. When fasts were observed in the early days,it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until af-ter the meeting in the afternoon of the fast day. In making donations to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that wouldbe necessary for the two meals should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the meansmay feel disposed to give.In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include allthe missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or in foreign lands. We think this arrangement will suit the convenience and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Churchin every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform andthe time be understood by all.Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if thereshould be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions andtroubles before the Lord. By approaching Him in the spirit of humil-ity and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or evilsfrom the individuals or from the people. Our past experience has proved to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and with proper faith. He is quick to hear the cries of His people, and He has prom-ised us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us. Suchoccasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advantage of by the afflicted,whether in an individual or in a collective capacityWith constant prayers for your welfare and happiness and the prosperityof the work of God,We are your brethren,Wilford Woodruff,George Q. Cannon,Joseph F. Smith.First Presidency. 
 Feeling the necessity of a correct understanding of this principle,we deem it proper at this sixty-sixth anniversary of the organization ofthe Church, in these last days, to prepare and present a statement onthe subject, embodying the doctrine which has always prevailed in the Church, and our views upon it. We are prompted to adopt thiscourse at the present time because of events which have happenedduring the late political contest. A great diversity of opinion on the subject has been expressed, and even by leading Elders in the Church, which latter facthas naturally led in some instances to considerable division of sentiment.It is of great importance that we understand each other and that there beharmony in our teachings. It is especially important that these teachingsshall be in accordance with the rules and doctrines which have beentaught and which have prevailed from the beginning until the presenttime, having not only the sanction of undisputed usage, but the approvalof all faithful leaders in the Church and of Him in whose name and by whose authority they act.In the late exciting contest, to which reference has been made, the pres-iding authorities in some instances have been misunderstood. In other instances they have been misrepresented, which has led to a wrongfulconseption of their real views. It has been asserted too freely, and withoutfoundation, that there has been a disposition on their part to interferewith individual liberty and to rebuke in some men a course which was applauded in others. In a word, that they have appeared to desire to assert and maintain an unjust and oppressive control over the actionsof the members of the Church, and in thus doing have endeavored to effect a union of Church and State. In the heat of political discus-sion, assertions have been made and arguments used conveying to the public mind a false idea concerning the position of the officers of the Church, and leaving the impression that there has been and was now being madean attempt to accomplish the union above referred to. Now that the excitement has passed, and calmer reason has resumed its sway,we think it prudent to set forth, so that all may understand, the exactposition occupied by the leading authorities of the Church.In the first place we wish to state in the most positive and empha-tic language that at no time has there ever been any attempt or even desire on the part of the leading authoritities referred to to have theChurch in any manner encroach upon the rights of the State, or to unite in any degree the functions of the one with those of the other.Peculiar circumstances have surrouned the people of Utah. For many years a majority of them in every portion of the Territory belonged to one Church, every reputable member of which was entitled to holdand did hold some ecclesiastical office. It is easy to see how, to the casual observer, it might appear singular that so many officers of the Church were also officers of the State; but while this was in fact the case, the distinction between the Church and the Statethroughout those years was carefully maintained. The President 
 Oct 2 [18]88Richard W. Young.Salt Lake City.Oct 10 [18]88attended tofile 
 of the Church held for eight years the highest civil office in the com-munity, having been appointed by the national administration governor of the Territory. The first secretary of the Territory was a prominent Church official. An Apostle represented the Territory in Congress as a delegate during ten years. The members of the Legislature held also offices in the Church. This was unavoidable;for the most suitable men were elected by the votes of the people,and, as we have stated, every reputable man in the entire commun-ity held some Church position, the most energetic and capable hold-ing leading positions. This is all natural and plain enough to those who consider the circumstances; but it furnished opportunity for those who were disposed to assail the people of the Territory to charge them with attempting to unite Church and State. A fairinvestigation of the conditions will abundantly disprove the charge and show its utter falsity.On behalf of the Church of which we are leading officers, we desire again to state to the members and also to the public generally, that there has not been, nor is there, the remotest desire on our part or on the part of our co-religionists to do anything looking to a unionof Church and State.We declare that there has never been any attempt to curtail in-dividual liberty of any of the officers or members of the Church. The First Presidency and other leading officers did make certain sugges-tions to the people when the division on party lines took place. Thatmovement was an entirely new departure, and it was necessary, in order that the full benefit should not be lost which was hoped to result from this new political division, that people who were inexperi-enced should be warned against hasty and ill-considered action. In some cases they were counseled to be wise and prudent in the politicalstep's they were about to take, and this with no idea of winning them againts their will to either side.To this extent, and no further, was anything said or done upon this question, and at no time and under no circumstances was any attempt made to say to voters how they should cast their ballots.Any charge that has been made to the contrary is utterly false.Concerning officers of the Church themselves, the feeling was generally expressed in the beginning of the political division spoken of that it wouldbe prudent for leading men not to accept of office at the hands of the politi-cal party to which they might belong. This counsel was given to men of both parties alikeâ€”not because it was thought that there was any im-propriety in religious men holding civil office, not to deprive them of any of the rights of citizenship, but because of the feeling that itwould be better under the circumstances which had now arisen to avoid any action that would be likely to create jealousy and ill-feeling. A era of peace and good-will seemed to be dawning upon the people, and it was deemed good to shun everything that could havethe least tendency to prevent the consummation of this happy prospect. 
 In many instances, however, the pressure brought to bear upon efficient and popular men by the members of the parties to which they belonged was of such a character that they had to yield to the solicitation to accept nom-ination to office, or subject themselves to the suspicion of bad faith in their party affiliations. In some cases they did this without consulting the authorities of the Church; but where important positions were held, andwhere the duties were of a responsible and exacting character, some didseek the counsel and advice of the leading Church authorities before accept-ing the political honors tendered them. Because some others did not seek this counsel and advice, ill-feeling was engendered, and undue and painful sensitiveness was stimulated; misunderstanding readily followed,and as a result the authorities of the Church were accused of bad faith and made the subjects of bitter reproach. We have maintained that in the case of men who hold high positions in the Church, whose duties are well defined, and whose ecclesiastical labors are understood to be continuous and necessary, it would be an improper thing to accept politi-cal office or enter into any vocation that would distract or remove them from the religious duties resting upon them, without first consulting and obtaining the approval of their associates and those who preside over them. It has been understood from the very beginning of the Church that no officer whose duties are of the character referred to, has theright to engage in any pursuit, political or otherwise, that will divide his time and remove his attention from the calling already accepted. It has been the constant practice with officers of the Churchto consultâ€”or, to use our language, to "counsel"â€”with their brethrenconcerning all questions of this kind. They have not felt that they were sacrificing their manhood in doing so, nor that they were submitting to improper dictation, nor that in soliciting and actingupon the advise of those over them, they were in any manner doingaway with their individual rights and agency, nor that to any im-proper degree were their rights and duties as American citizens being abridged or interferred with. They realized that in accept-ing ecclesiastical office they assumed certain obligations; that amongthese was the obligation to magnify the office which they held, to attend to its duties in preference to every other labor, and to devote them-selves exclusively to it with all the zeal, industry and strength they possessed, unless released in part or for a time by those who presideover them. Our view, and it has been the view of all our predeces-sors, is that no officer of our Church, especially those in high standing, should take a course to violate this long established practice. Rather than disobey it, and declare himself by his actions defiantly independ-ent of his associates and his file leaders, it has always been heldthat it would be better for a man to resign the duties of his Priesthood;and we entertain the same view to-day.In view of all the occurrencies to which reference has been made, and to the diversity of views that have arisen among the people in consequence, 
 We feel it to be our duty to clearly define our position, so there may be no cause hereafter for dispute or controversy upon the subject:Firstâ€”We unanimously agree to and promulgate as a rule that should always be observed in the Church and by every leading officialthereof, that before accepting any position, political or otherwise, which would interfere with the proper and complete discharge of his ecclesi-astical duties, and before accepting a nomination or entering into engagements to perform new duties, said official should apply to the proper authorities and learn from them whether he can, consistently with the obligations already entered into with the Church upon assuming hisoffice, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibili-ties of the new position. To maintain proper discipline and order in the Church, we deem this absolutely necessary; and in asserting this rule, we do not consider that we are infringing in the least de-gree upon the individual rights of the citizen. Our position is that a man having accepted the honors and obligations of ecclesiasticaloffice in the Church cannot properly of his own volition make those honors subordinate to or even co-ordinate with new ones of an entirely different character; we hold that unless he is willing to counselwith and obtain the consent of his fellow-laborers and presiding officersin the Priesthood, he should be released from all obligations associatedwith the latter, before accepting any new position.Secondâ€”We declare that in making these requirements of ourselves and our brethren in the ministry, we do not in the leastdesire to dictate to them concerning their duties as American citi-zens, or to interfere with the affairs of the State; neither do we considerthat in the remotest degree we are seeking the union of Church andState.We once more here repudiate the insinuation that thereis or ever has been an attempt by our leading men to trespass upon the ground occupied by the State, or that there has been or is the wish to curtail in any manner any of its functions.Your brethren,Wilford Woodruff,George Q.

 O. F. AtwoodHoopervilleOct. 3 [18]87.Hooperville, Sep 29th 1887Elder Wilford WoodruffDear Sir Insearching the Book of Doctrine and CovenantsI find a revelateaion wherein the Lord says, Beholdverily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have receiveda commandment for a law unto my churchthrough him whom I have appointed unto youto receive revelations and commandments frommy hand. But verily, verily, I say unto you,that none else shall be appointed unto this gift,except it be through him, for if it be taken fromhim, he shall not have power except to appointanother in his stead. And this shall be a lawunto you, that ye receive not the teachings ofany that shall come before you as revelations orcommandments. And this I give unto youthat you may not be deceived, that you may 
 as heretofore assumed by the church.We respectfully submit the matterto you for your consideration, and willcheerfully endorse any decision youmay arrive at in the premises.Before closing this letter, permit usin behalf of the family to express ourthanks for the prompt and generous ^manner^ whichcharacterized the funeral arrangementsof the late President John Taylorand for the liberal expenditure of meansand labor devoted to the constructionof ^the^ Granite Sarcophagus enclosinghis remains.In regard to Trust property,should there be any, nowremaining in the nameof President John Tayloras Trustee in Trust for theChurch of Jesus Christ of 
 know they are not of me. This is very plain,and this law is in force to day upon the churchas much as it was in the day it was given.And it is the imperative duty of every memberin this church to know that another has beenappointed unto this gift through the ProphetJoseph Smith, or according to this law, we mustreject the message, or great will be the condemnationof this people. This brings us to the great and importantquestion, Did the Prophet Joseph Smith confer thisgift upon another? There is an order in this churchthat every man can show his authority, and theoffice to which he has been appointed. It is by thelaying on of hands by one halding holding the author-ity. Every person in this church that claimsauthority must be able to show how he received it.The Prophet Joseph Smith plainly showed andproved by witnesses his right to what he claimed.Now every person in this church should be able to answer this question, Did the Prophet Joseph Smithlay his hands upon another and bestow this giftupon him? In this we must not be mistaken. 
 Latter-day Saints, we wouldtake pleasure, at any time; intransferring the same to an[y]whomsoever you may designateTrusting we shall befavored with an answer atyour earliest convenience andpraying for your continualwelfare we remain.Yours very respectfullyGeorge J. TaylorJohn W. TaylorExecutors of the Estate ofPresident John Taylor Deceased. 
 The welfare of this church depends upon a knowledgeof this. In another revelation it says. But, behold,verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall beappointed to receive commandments and revelationsin this church, excepting my servant JosephSmith, jun, for he receiveth them even as Moses.We all know that Moses received commandmentsand revelations for a law to guide and govern allIsrael until Christ come in the flesh. The peopleknew that Moses talked with the Lord, and theyknew that his word was the word of the Lord thereforethey must be obedient to it. We can see by readingthe ##Numbers 27:18-23|27th chap of Numbers## how the Lord dealt withthe people, that they might not be deceived. BeforeMoses went away the Lord said to him. Take theeJoshua the son of Nun, as man in whom is the spiritand lay thine hand upon him, And set him beforeEleazar the priest, and before all the congregationand give him a charge in their sight. And thenshalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all thecongregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.And he laid his hands upon him and gave him acharge as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, 
 Geo. J. TaylorJohn W. Taylor25 Oct. 1887 
 I will say here that the Priesthood which Mosesreceived under the hand of his father-in-law Jethroand Jethro received it under the hand of Caleband so back to Esaias who received it under the handof God. This is the High Priesthood which is thegreatest of all. [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:6-7##] Moses confered this branch of theHoly Priesthood upon the Prophet Joseph Smithwhich is for the gathering of Israel, the establishmentof Zion, and the building of holy temples, and leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north. [##Doctrine and Covenants 110:11##]All other branches of the Priesthood are appenda-ges to this. The High Priesthood is a local office,to take charge of the affairs of Zion and her stakesto be assisted by the lesser Priesthood to see thatthat her laws are kept which will sanctify thepeople and prepare them to redeem Zion. Thenthe Twelve and Seventies are a travelling ministryto preach the gospel in all the world. The TwelveApostles holds the keys of this ministry. This is 
 plainly written in the Book of Doctrine and Cov-enants, and it also agrees with a decision of theProphet Joseph Smith, at a grand Council heldin Kirtland May 2nd 1835 which says that President Joseph Smith then stated, That the Twelve willhave no right to go into Zion or any of herstakes and there undertake to regulate the affairsthereof, where there is a standing High Councilbut it is their duty to go abroad and regulateall matters relative to the different branches ofthe church. No standing High Council hasauthority to go into the churches abroad and regulate the matters thereof for this belongs to theTwelve. Showing their two distinct fields oflabor, and the specific duties belonging to eachbranch of the Priesthood. There should be greatweight placed upon all the decisions of the ProphetJoseph, for the Lord says He has inspired himto lay the foundation of this church and to buildit up unto the most holy faith. And the Lord also 
 says, Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandmentswhich he shall give unto you as he receiveth themwalking in all holiness before me, For his wordye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith; For by doing these thingsthe gates of hell shall not prevail against you,yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powersof darkness from before you, and ^cause^ the heavens toshake for your good and His name's glory.We can see that the blessings of the Lord dependsupon our obedience to the word of the Lord revealed through Joseph Smith. How essential it is that wesearch this great law and that it is taught to the peopleand that this church is set in order according to therevelations and commandments which we have received.The reason I have for writing this letter to you is becauseof the anxiety I have for the welfare of this people. Ihave written with the earnest feelings of my heart in the fear ofthe Lord knowing that what I have written is true. Now as theTwelve again take the responsibility as leaders of the church, youshould answer intelligently to the church, how and by what meansyou claim this great honor? Yours as ever Orville F Atwood

 Scarborough Maine May 3rd 1838Hon parentsI sit down this morning in company with Phebe& Mother Carter for the purpose of addressing a few lines to you. Ihave just written a letter to Brother Asahel one object I have in viewin writing at this time is to inform you of my present calculations & intentions. A person situated as I am in life & calling Does not at all times know what a day or a month will bring forth or where they may be called to stand in defence of the truth. I held two conferences the middle of April upon fox Island & organized a Church upon each of the Islands & left them in a situation to attend to their meetings while I am absent the two Churches number about 50 members being the fruitsof my labour during the past season & in consequence of recieving some intelligence from Elder Parley P. Pratt now preaching in the City of New York. I have left the Islands for the purpose of visiting that City & am now at Father Carters house Phebe has spent the winter with me upon the Islands she returned home by water the 20th of April at that time I expected to have spent the Summer upon the Islands but on recieving intelliegence from NY. I left the Islands on the 28 of April & returned to father Carters in company with ElderMilton Holmes on the 1st of May I intend to persue my journey on Monday I am expect-ing to visit Lynn, Boston, Holiston & the City of NY, as the work of God is pro-gressing in those places & it is my present calculation to visit you in conn-ectcut either going or on my return I felt last season that an opportunity would offer for me to visit you again & I now feel as though that time is nigh. I am expecting to lead a company of Saints from the Islands to the City far West Monext September I expect Phebe will accompany me to Missouri if her circumstances will admit which I trust will be the case. She would be glad to visit you this seasonbut I suppose will not be able to. She sends her respects to you & Sister Eunice & all who inquire. I was highly edifyed with the reading of your last letter should you write to me again please direct to Scarborough Maine as Phebe will

 Aug 3rd [18]94OvandoI want to say thatI did not comprehend whatyou was at when you wasasking for Max. Now I shall go up this Evening & takeprince and tomorrow Eveningyou can take Caezar andthe cart on the buggy tosuit yourself Emma will seeyou to day Now if Claracould go up with us tonight I would have likedit of course going up theMountain we will all ofus have to drive or a walkand take the check down 
 will be here & attend to all of my letters while I am absent. You spoke of our paperthe Elder's Journal I wrote to the Editor to forward the papers to you but as youdid not recieve them I forwarded my two first numbers to youwhich will be all that any of us will obtain at present for the printing Officehas been burned to the ground with all of its contents it is supposed to have benset on fire by whom is unknown consequently their will the no more printeduntill the press is set up in Missouri when I expect will be before longthe work of the Lord is progressing rapidly whareever it is proclaimed thisseason & there never has been mor efforts made against it as thepresent season some few fals brethren who have made shipwreck of faithare joined with the world in opposing the Church & our principles but it is all to no affect they cannot cause the scriptures to the brocken neither canthey stop the work of God. The work of God has finally taken a strong holdin the City of NY. Elder Pratt writes that 75 have been added to the churchin the City & that the work has but just begun I am now Baptizing day& night we have two meeting houses that we occupy & we preach every Sunday in Tamany Hall the most noted Hall in the City we are crowded beyondconception some people come 20 or 30 miles to hear & obey the gospel. as to oppositionthe City is in a general uproar in many parts. The priests rage & foam & many of them go to such length that every honest man is driven to the necessity of com-ing out from them. Many newspapers & two pamphlets are filled against us Ihave replyed to Mr Sunderlands peices in the Zions Watchman in apamphlet of 42 pages which I wish to be circulated wharever that paperhas gone. Visions, Tongues, prophesying, & healings are manifest in this City thedesiples are firm in the faith in this place & are ready to suffer death forChrist sake & the truth, there is more calls in the City as well as con-ntry than we can possibly attend to. These with many other good things BrotherPratt says in this letter. So I am now on my way to visit him a short timeI shall calculate to call at Farmington in May or June if the Lord will &pay you a visit. I think you said in your letter that Uncle Ozem & 
 Sunday Morning, Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio, May 7th 1837.Aphek & Azubah Woodruff,Dear ParentsWhile the Sun issheding his brilliant rays to gladden earth, & the Saints thronging the streets ofKirtland on their way to worship in the Temple of the Lord I avail myselfof the opportunity (in company with my wife) of spending a few leasure momentsof again addressing you with my pen. I said in company with mywife. I am sensible that a remark of this kind from my pen is unexpected& unlooked for by you unless the paper bearing the account of my marriageth hath fallen into your hands be that as it may suffice it to say thatI was married on the 13th of April 1837, to Miss Phebe W. Carter,from the State of Maine. I was married at the house of Joseph Smith jun in Kirtland the ceremony solemnized by F. G. Williams, Esq. My wife is atayloress by trade which occupation she has closly followed for the last seven yearsher time for several seasons previous was spent in teaching school. Weare both of us old enough to be wise their is as many days differance in our agesas God was making the heavens & the Earth. I was born March 1st  1807, my wife was born March 8th 1807 making her 7 days the youngest. Perhaps you may wonderat my taking upon me the marriage covenant considering my callingin life I should not have taken such a step had I not been fullyconvinced it was the will of God neither will it (or some might suppose)ever hinder me from cleaning my garments of the blood of this generationor finishing my mission to Jew or gentile. My wife is enjoyinggood health peace, & contentment, & sends her respects to you whohave become her parents by law although strangers unto her shewishes to be remembered to sister Eunice. She has a desire to visit you allwhich I trust may yet be the case. I am enjoying goodhealth which hath ever been the case since I left you. I havenot herd from any of you for a long time. I have written to you& several of my relatives since I returned to Kirtland but havenot received answers I received a letter from Brother AsahelAsDated Dec 16th1836 Terre Haute he wished to corresspond with meI wrote him two letters since but received no answer perhaps he didnot receive them I wrote a letter to Brother Azmon also but herdnothing from him since you wrote to me in Tennessee Ihave spent the winter in school but am expecting to spend the summerin the vineyard of the Lord The route which I expect to take this season(unless some unforeseen circumstance should change it) is as follows oneweek from monday I expect to take water on lake Erie for black River country

I have long desiredto visit you & the rest of my relatives in the east & I trust that Godmay open my way before me this season that I may have the desires ofmy heart in this thing that I may speak & answer for myself in allthings pertaining to the Kingdom of God. my motive would not be seekingfor honour in my own country for I should not expect to obtain it for if aprophet could not find honour in his own country how could a Teacher expectit, yet I feel for my kindred those bound to me by the ties of consangu-inity I desire to proclaim unto them the words of Eternal the greatestgift of God & warn them of things as they are in these last days that mygarments may be clean of their blood & the blood of all men leaving the eventwith God that peradventure I may be an instrument in the hands of Godof bringing some of my relatives into the New & everlasting covenant Iknow not but it may be the last mission among my kindred that I shall be privileged with therefore I pray God to grant me success this onceTime flies. the gentiles are ripe in iniquity & prepared for judgment.

 aunt Hannah was at your house give my respects to them & to all enquiringfriends I was sorry to hear of Aunt Hannah's Ill health I am in hopes she willagain be restored in body & mind. You will notice in the papers I sent youthat the work of the Lord has commenced in England & I learn from lateletters that it is progressing with speed. I view an important day at handeven the day of the gathering of Israel & bloody wars & other judgmentsupon the gentiles The Lord is about to take peace from the earth & therehath already a lying spirit gone forth among men to stir them up toanger one against another The signs in the heavens & Earth all indi-cate the near approach of the Son of God greater darkness never coveredEgypt than now covers the professed Christian world they neither believein nor are looking for the timr & literal fulfillment of the word of God con-sequently it will over take them as a thief in the night. Had we the tongue of Angels& the zeal of Apostles, possessing the intelligence of heaven, with our hearts expandingwide as eternity, & our bosoms burning with the love of God & commissionedto bear as glad tidings as was ever [borne] by Michael the Ark Angel. It wouldbe as much impossible to fill our mission & deliver our message in a manner tobe recieved & approbated by the majority of this generation, as it was for ST Paulwhile at Ephesus declairing glad tidings of a Crusified & risen redeemer, while hisvoice was lost amid the day of the Ephesians that great is the goddess Diana. [##Acts 19:23-41##] I havea great anxiety for the spiritual well fare of my relatives & that they may be preparedfor the unparalled judgments, & august events that are rolling upon the headsof this generation. I wished to be remembered to Sister Eunice I suppose sheis either teaching or attending school. I learn that Brother Asahel & Mr Smithhave dissolved pardonsip [partnership] & that Asahel attends to his Book business aloneI have had some interesting & satisfactory letters from Asahel during the pastwinter I am in hopes his mind will yet incline to the things of God. I wantan interest in all of your prayers I remember you all before a throne of GraceMay the peace of God abide with you all & lead you into all truth for Christ SakeAphek & Azubath Woodruff From your SonWillford Woodruff 
 to bear the sound of the gospel & be warned that the hour of judgmentmay come. I expect soon to be called to accompany my brethrento that land perhaps by the opening of another spring thes things mayappear as idle tales to thousands & perhaps to my kindred but whenhorid famine desolates the east & every man's sword raised against his neighbour through the land while all law is but a mame & pestilence wastes theharts of men Earthquakes & horible tempest desolates cities & villages. thereflecting mind of none others during the fulfillment of thes things will begin tobelieve that there is a gGod in Israel who reveals himself in these last days& that He hath a prophet in the land. I desire the temporal& spiritual welfare of all my friends I would not lead or wish to seethem led into any error or evil I expect they will all act as agents forthemselfes I expect to do the same I have peculiar feelings for themall I marvel at the great events of these last days that have & aretranspiring I view a special hand of God in dealing with me through lifeI am experiencing the fulfillment of many of my former impressionwhich were dictated by the spirit of truth. I receieved the gospel of Jesus Christas proclaimed by the Latter Day Saints the first time I herd it from that dayto the present I have no doubts upon the subjects yea I know itto be the work of God & although the gentiles rage the prests imagine thousandsvain things a flood of evil epithets & falshoods heaped upon our heads & perils,of fals brethers & some dishonor the Holy priesthood & their anointing bybreaking the commandments of God & acting wickedly I say notwithstandingall these things the work of God still rolls on in this place & all places wharethe word is faithfully preached the stone rolls the kingdom grows therehas seldom a sabbath passed by us since I have been in Kirtlandbut what numbers have been added to the church the work is stillprogressing with rapidity in the English dominions & all places whareit is proclaimed. Latest accounts from Missouri said it was a time ofhealth great plenty & prosperity & universal peace with all men the Saintshave settled a county by themselves at present they are still constantlygathering, with prosperity their will be a large city there in Kirtland soonas the saints are building fast. But I must draw to a close givemy respects to all enquiring friends I wish to be remembered to sisterEunice you may look for me during the season, if theLord will I shall endeavour to visit you. I pray God to give usall wisdom light & truth that we may escape the dangers of this perilousgeneration which is the prayer of your SonWilford WoodruffAphek & Azubeh Woodruff

 Simsbury April 27th 1845Respected Cousin,With feelings of gratitude I take my pen in to acknowledge thereceipt of a few lines from you on this the 27th of April directed to me & addressed to "my friend."I aem much rejoiced to hear from you & your family that you are all alive in the landof the living & enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. and, it is with pleasure that I embracethe opportunity of answering your letter, ecp^ect^ing to be able to give you some information, which you earnestly desire & which may be some consolation while far away in a distantland. I have both good & bad news to communicate, but nothing so bad as I think youhave apprehended. We your friends are all alive, some enjoying comfortable health whileothers still partake of the cup of affliction, with many comforts mingled. I will give you anaccount of each & any one agreeable to your request, inasmuch as I have received intelli-gence myself. I will commence with our family who are among the number of the afflictedThere has been no very material change with us. Mother remains about the same if any differance in her situation it is for the worseâ€”It appears to me that her ease is a peculiar one.she seems to have all reason & yet no reason, knows evry^thing^ & knows nothing. I do not know whatto think about her, sometimes I have a good degree of confidence to believe that she will recover& sometimes I doubt, at all times I place much dependance on the faith of my friends. If it can beconsistant will the will of God & his purposes concerning us. I earnestly desire that my mother may berestored to health & to the right use of her reason. If such a blessing is ever mine know assur^e^dlythat I am happy. My health is about the same as when I wrote. Sister Ann is about parwith me she has been much afflicted during the past winter with a nervous tooth-ache whichhas reduced her strength very much, but we have been ennabled by the help of God to bearall that has been laid upon us & are still able to do our necessary housework, but I think myhealth has been poorer since you left than ever before, as has been the case with Sister Ann. BrotherCyrus is well & doing well. I have not seen Aunt Bulah since late in the fall, but understand herhealth has been poor through the winter. we are expecting her here daily. I have heard nothingparticular from Uncle Ozem's family, they are living in Lovely street, & I conclude well. I have learnedby the bye that Mr Herd is dead, no other connexions. I have had somwhat recent intelligence ^both^ fromRichland & Nauvoo, by way of a letter from Aunt Woodruff your Mother, directed to us & dated March 30from which I will make some extracts, by so doing give you all the information I am in possession of respectingthose distant friends. "We have been some disappointed in our earthly expectationsthe year past but tho we were some cast down for a time yet we have not been forsaken, we have enjoyedourselves notwithstanding as well as formerly, we have a plenty of house room tolerably convenient & enoughto eat & drink & we have been favored with having good news from our children at Nauvoo. We received a letter short timesince under Date of Feb 9th & March 16th. the greatest part being dictated by Eunice. Mr Webster being scribe & addressed 
 to Mother, she writes that as to her health it had not been as well since they last wrote (being then able to dosome light work) untill a week past the circumstances of which she says she will mention. Mr. Webster having joined theCarriage & Coach association came home one night from his buisness & said that Brother Roberts (the one who kickedup such a bobery in New York by an evil spirit getting hold of him) said to him in view of his being detained from his workby sickness in his family that if he would come down next Monday he would prophecy in the name of the Lord that he &his wife would both get well, that she was rather disposed to make light of it as she thought him to be possessed of rather anaspiring mind that on account of her former prejudices & prepositions thought probable he spok in his own nameinstead of by the power of the Priesthood. I said to Br Frost a member of the association a few nights after words Br. R. is goingto have us healed right off he said Roberts had a good spirit that night. I can tell when he has a right spirit, I believe hedid speak in the name of the Lord. this she says set me a thinking for I knew frost was on the Look out for him as well as we, thenext week on Sunday she says which was a week ago to day some one rapped at the door & I was introduced to Br Roberts. Amongother things he enquired about my health & said he thought if I would have a little more faith I could get well, I told him ifI had a great deal I thought I might, told him she had had quite a spirit of labor for her health 2 or 3 days past more sothan usual, he said that might be accounted for, that the Brethren fo the associaton had been praying for her, she says herprejudice began to wear away & said to him is your mind led to pray for me, would it be led to administer to me at myrequest, that he accordingly did so, & it was evident that he had the spirit of the Lord, his prayer being very appropriate to hercase, he pronounced the blessing of health upon me & said I should begin from that time to gain &c that he told her afterwards ifshe would begin to excercise, be sure & do enough be carful & not do too much, he would promise her she should soon be better, thiswas the substance of the matter & she found his words to prove true, she went to work the next day & had been quite smart throughthe week washing dishes cooking & c she then writes under date March 16th about five weeks from the commencement of her letter& says she has the took a good deal aside from that she is quite smart, says Dwight goes to his work after breakfast & she gets along throughthe day with the chores & gets supper ready against he gets home. I am rejoiced to learn that there is so good a prospect of E's gettingher health. she says (in referance to my informing her that we had received a letter from Azmon giving his Father aninvitation to go & live by or near them &c) she says give my love to him & tell him as bad as the Mormans be I would not be dep-rived of being with the body of the saints on any account whatever & then adds, I have much I would like to say upon principlebut cannot do it by letter, prepare yourselves for great things prepare yourselves for great doctrine, prepare yourselves for becomingrid of many tradisions. I had tradition when I came to Nauvoo, which I am trying hard to get rid of the fact is she saysthe laws of the Celestial Kingdom are such that but few of even the siants will be able to abide them, but my faith is notshaken at all in the work. I have been deprived of the privilege of going to meeting yet notwithstanding I have learnedmany things which I could not have learned in public. this from Willford's family, now from Brother Page's one of the twelvewho lives in the house with us, only a door separates us, they are fine family. they have a young woman boarding with themwho came from Boston last fall, her Mother is a rich widow woman worth about 15000 she sacrificed friends & property.Mr Webster has joined the Carriage & Coach association, which they think will help them to get a comfortable living for their familyI have just referred above to the invitation we received not long since from Azmon to live with him or by him, he wrotevery affectionately & gave us a handsome invitation to go there, thought his father could have a plenty of work if hewished in his saw mill & shingle mill which he designs to get in operation by June but wishes us to act in accordancewith out own feelings on the subject not wishing to urge us contrary to our minds, but thinks it would be our best wayto come over if we intended to go to Nauvoo some day, but we do not now think of going to Richland, we do not have a letter yet Wilford which I think rather strange of" I was very glad to get the above information, wish I could see the letterI intended to write to them ere long, if I can find myself composed enough. It is hard for me to write amidst so much confusion& I cannot get away from it. I have received no other news from Nauvoo except what I occasionally get from the Prophetdont you occasionally get that paper? If so you may be as well informed respecting Nauvoo & the prosperit of the causof God abroad as myself as it is through that medium I get nearly all the information I am in possession of. I should judgefrom that paper things were going on tolerably well in general & that in many places the work is prospering much,especially in Lowel, Mass New York, Newhaven Cities, Clinton Ct. & in other places the work is progressing. there was a Branch of the church organized in Hartford last winter of 7 or 8 members, ^& more believing^ whether they have ben added to the churchsince I do not know. All the information I have gained respecting the work there was from Brother Sparks, & Burnhamwho visited us last winter. ^number times^ visited Farmington Avon & Weatouge but was not able to accomplish much on accountof the prejudice of the minds of the people. They made an appointment in Farmington, none attended but theSaints. I think they preached once in Avon twice in Weatogue & once in Hopmeadow, the first in WeatogueI could not attend, but went to the second I can assure you I as happy as a lark on my way & untill nearthe close of the meeting when my joy was turned to distraction. There was a large congregation, some of the principalones left before the close of the sermon Perhaps becasue the speaker was lengthy; but while he was making his closingremarks all of a sudden there was a stamping hooting laughing & all sorts of music. Br Sparks undertook to reasonwith the leader, some conversation ensued rough enough too on the part of the enemy which consisted of theschool teacher & some of his scholars none very apt but himself soon the lights were blown out I was in a sorrypredicament nearly all had left but the mobbers & I knew not what to do as [blank] my Brother C. who accom-panied he had retired unnoticed. I appreached the stand & enquired of Br Burnham what I should do, by thistime one light was blown up again by Br Sparks, Br B took it in one hand gave me the other & told me to followhim. we went down stairs being saluted on the way found Brother Cyrus near the door waiting for me &watching his horse, he left the meeting on account of feeling somewhat ill & found it necessary to remain withor near his horse. So much for the prosperity of Mormonism in Weatogue I believe they will go to destruction bywholesale. They behaved more respectfully in Hopmeadow Indeed they would scorn such things but the weath-er was extremely cold & but few people attended. I have heard no fault found with any thing that was advanced & no comments whatever except from 1 or 2 young people who observed that he was quite a talker I believe they wassomewhat confounded by the doctrines held forth but then he was noboddy but a Mormon. They visited us again &proposed holding another meeting, applied for the better schoolhouse (a dwelling house occupied for school) 
 but was refused on the plea of [blank] [beining] no buisness to let it they would not accept of the old house on accountof its being so cold & uncomfortable, had we been well I would kept them preaching in our house as long as they would staywhether any body attended or not (this last visit of which I have been speaking was the day they preached in Weatouge I haveneither seen or heard from these Brothers since, perhaps they have gone to Nauvoo if not Brother Sparks remains in Hartfordhe removed his family there last fall. Respecting who has the care of other churches I do not know as there has been aspecial call from the west for the Elders generally to repair to Nauvoo to spend the summer, working on the Temple &c&c I expect those who could go have gone leaveing the care of branches with those who could not go. I rejoice thatElder Pratt has taken the Presidency of the churches in this eastern land. I think much good will be the result.I had forgotten to speak of Westfield & Windson I believe some have been added to the Churches there. I have greatly desiredthat something might be done in this place. I think Brother Sparks would have made further effort had it not been forexpences I did all I could for him but could not do much for reasons which I will not name however we furnished themwith what they needed during their visits (or principally) excepting lodging that was procured at the publichouse at their own expence & they was nearly destitute of means. I greatly desire to be in a situation to enter-tain my bretheren especially those who are destitute, by so doing I should ^be^ comforted edified & benefitted.Doubtless you have heard of the unconditional repeal of the Nauvoo Charter & also that the Temple has beenprogressing rapidly. They are expecting to commence the endowment soon as the first of December next.If Eunice enjoys health I think she will have a good time this Summer, she seems to value her privileges I could^[saih]^ I was there to share with her, how ^much^ should value the society of the saints no one can easily immagine, I think I couldfully appreciate such blessings. But although I am deprived of many Privileges & have to wander alone through life's unevenways, weary & worn. I often rejoice in the anticipation of a future day, when saints will meet & be forever blest.I wish all my friends to understand that I remain as firm in the faith & doctrines of the Latter day saints as at the begin-ning that I have not renounced or been shaken in no one principle that I ever embraced Mormonism is my gloryin time & I hope it will be in eternity, but I oftentimes get discouraged & fear I shall not be found worthy.I neglected to speak particularly respecting your Father & Mother's health. In general I believe they have enjoyed comfortablehealth but sometimes complaining. She writes in her last as follows, "I should have written you ere this had it been possible underexisting circumstances. I have a great deal to do this winter of work left behind on account of our past sickness, I have satup most of the time at night untill 12 o clock & after & have not got necessary things done yet, my health not very goodnot but better than it was a few weeks since, I had a seated pain in my side for 3 or 4 weeks & was afraid I shouldget sick with pleurisy or Lung fever which has prevailed here, but have been delivered from ^those^ symptoms. Capt Richards Cowlwas buried yesterday & Mr Camp last week." She did not speak "of your Father," I should not wonder if he failed & d[ink splot]suddenly. If reports are true respecting your stay on this mission doubtless you will never see your Father [ink splot]It was reported in the Prophet & also by Brother Sparks that you expected to stay five years, that is a long time. [ink splot]dire changes may take place ere that period expires. I get the Prophet regularly & it is a source of great co[ink splot]It a very interesting and instructive paper, containing much upon principle & doctrine that I never had an understand-ing of before. there was one piece entitled, "Celestial family organization: that was noble. it was written by ElderPratt of New York he teaches things both new & old & I am ready to receive it. I think people ougth to be instructed as theyare able to receive. Cousin Eunice says the laws of the Celestial kingdom are such that but few of the saints canabide them. How can I abide a law that I have no knowledge of, I desire knowledge & instruction beyond whatI have means to obtain. Wonder how you & Cousin Phebe would feel if you could not ever see a Mormonfrom one end of the year to the other. I guess some like me. Your Father & mother, & myself desire to go the westin pursuit of a more congelial clime, but not to Richland. Hereafter I do not expect to enjoy the privilegesfor information that I have done three numbers more will close the first volume of the Prophet. The priceis increased to two dollars per annum, which with 75 cts postage will be too much for me to pay undermy limited circumstances, being in no buisness. The Prophet will hereafter be printed in Boston ^386 Washington Street^ the same asin New York. I think the churches do well in regard to their tithing & donations five hundred dollars wassent to N. York at one time from Boston, they are all zealously engaged in cause of the Temple.25 were added to the church in N. York at one time mostly, youths & children. the last account from St. Lewis10 had recently been baptized by Elder O Hyde at one time, which the congregation stood as solemn witnessess &many of then overwhelmed in tears. Elder Grant wrote from Philadelphia under date of March 22nd he informs usthat the Saints there, are generally engaged for the welfare of Zion & are doing well for the Temple & for the laws in thewest & they are increasing in numbers in that City & are baptizing new converts from time to time. Several hundredof tithing for the Temple was sent from that city by Elder Fordham, who came on a special mission & has returned tothe west. she following extracts of a private letter Dated Nauvoo 6th of April, the Prophet copies, (just now received) "The Templeis rolling up with rapidity & bids fair for a speedy completion. The saints around here seem to take an active interest in it, & eachone manifests a willingness to do all they can. It is a general time of health with us & we yet enjoy peace, notwithstanding the clatteringof the rattlesnakes of Warsaw & the croaking of the filthy toads of Carthage & surrounding mud ponds. It is true they threatenhard & appear to be making active preparations to do somthing, & I suppose if they could do as they want to, the poor Mormons, wouldall be greased over & swallowed up before summer comes, but the saints feel calm and unmoved having their trust in that Godwho has defended this Church for the last fifteen years, & the Priesthood from the days of Adam. Ther appears to only one feelingamong the saints here & that is to do the will of God finish the Temple & Nauvoo house & love & defend each other, there is a goodspirit prevails in Nauvoo & things look about right." I will just mention that there has been destructions by fire of latein the adjoining states, but none so large & destructive as in Pittsburgh 20 square miles burnt millions of property, destroyedI expect the Rigdonites are burnt over, & also many buildings destroyed by lightning. This reported that England that England &America are going to war. I wish you would occasionally send us the Millenial Star. If you have sent any papers we have notreceived them. Whenever you feel disposed to write us, a letter would meet with a very ^welcome^ reception & I hopp[e] you will write yourFather & Mother often, it will do them good, while deprived of the society of all their children. If you ever get through with readingthis & do ever write again, do take a little larger bit of paper & give us all the news you have. Sister Ann said the thought paper wasrather scarce in your country. She sends her love to you, likewise Br C. My love to Cousin Phebe. From you Cousin B C 
 I have heard nothing from your Br Thompson since you leftI wish you had informed us how your wife likes England, &whatnot she is expecting to go with you to France &c.great fire in Virginia & a disease is waiting there. Proving fatal in almost evry case. Several hundreds persons have diedThere are more diseases in our land than I ever knewbefore. Perhaps you are informed with regard to all these thingsI said to Mother have you no word to send to Wilfordshe says tell ^him^ we are all going to starve & freeze to death. I spokeI told her I thought we should have to wait till next winter beforewe freeze. I guess ^we^ will want no more letters from me without aninterpreter. remember us.

 40 Ironmonger Row Saint Lukes London Dec 28th 1840Elder George A. SmithDear BrotherI received two lettersfrom you one Nov 30 & the other Dec 3d & I should havewritten you answers immediately. But Elder Kimballwas writing to you at that time & giving youall the news so I thought it would be a mereform if I wrote.

We had a good many out to hear& among the rest a Wesleyan Preacher came & Broughthis whole congregation, & as soon as I got through preaching Before We closed our meeting, the Methodist preachergot up, & opposed me with all his power; & tore aroundlike a madman & I think it done more good than mypreaching, for it made us priests & all the committy ofthe house were mad at him, & he was for bid comeing thereto preach any more, [FIGURE] & in fine it made quite a stirBut what the result of it will be I know not. MrAlbun the preacher that Invited us there thinks he shall

W's kind letterof Dec. 31st. via Sacramento is just recd the paper sent me at the same time has not cometo hand yet, hope it will for I should likemuch to see it. I am quite suprised that you do not receive more letters from me for I write you occasionally. I did not receive oneof the letters you write me at Sacramento.We are hoping to see M. W. here one of these days but hardly dare to expect Mrs W.however such a thing may happen. It is unnecessary for me to say that it would afford us great pleasure. I have been in Portlandthe most of the time since I arrived from Cal. My family came in to day. I have been withS & Carter, and perhaps may remain here fora time, Freedom and family came up lastweek and are at Scarbro so you will per ceive that Shuah is at the old placeand I think they must be highly pleasedto get away from Juy.

I recd. your last letter stating theamount forwarded at the time. My old affairsremain much the same as yet, which is a source of great annoiance to me, exceedinglyunpleasant, but I hope some time to get ridof them. Mss. Carter is not very smart thesedays. In my family affairs would admit of itI should tryd. to have driven some stock to Cal. for I am anxious to do some thing to extricatemyself from old debts, Calvin started off with funds to buy cattle with M. Rollins, but where 
 he came to get out where Mr. R. lived he foundhim rather out of health so that they were obligedto give up the enterprise. I felt quite disappointed C with me that he thought he should go to Salt Lake notw he has started, and visit hisfriends there, I was glad to him that your prospectsme so pacific and promising. I hope Gods choicest blessings may rest on you and yours, that we may have His grace to direct us in all thingsthat one may meet his approbation and at last hear the welcome sentence of come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom &c.Yes, I hope we shall so spend our days her[page torn]that we may meet in heaven.Please remember me very kindly to Ms.Foss and family, ask them to write.
