March 22, 1844 ~ Friday   22nd Friday Mrs Woodruff returned home from Br Benbows whare she had been taking care of Wilford who had been vary sick she had been there two weeks we were both satisfied to be at home FIGURE with our children FIGURES   ENDENTRY March 24, 1844 ~ Sunday   24th March Sunday I met with the saints at the Temple when I arived President Joseph Smith was speaking the following is the substa- nce of what I herd him say   I have been informed by two gentleman that a conspiricy is got up in this place for the purpose of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his family and all the Smith family, the heads of the Church, one of the gentleman will give his name to the public and the other wishes it to be hid for the present they will both testify to it on oath and make an affidavit upon it the names of the persons revealed at the head of the conspiracy are as follows (Chancy Higby Dr Wilson Law) And the lies that Higby has hatched up as a foundation to work upon is he says that I had mens heads cut off in Missouri and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the people that I wanted to kill and put out of the way. I wont sware out a warrent against them for I dont fear any of them they would not scare off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity that I know of. If I am guilty I am ready to bear it their is honor among enemies I am willing to do any thing for the good of the people. I will give the names of one of the gentleman who have divulged the plot his name is Eaton, he will sware to it he is a bold fellow. Jackson said a Smith should not be alive 2 weeks not over two months any how. As concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about it now but If I hear any thing more from them on this subject I will tell what I know about them   Elder O. Spencer addressed the people as follows. I thought of a figure ie if a physician   ENDENTRY was going to dissect a body he would not begin at the limbs but cut the head off first. So the Adversary has laid a plan to cut off the head of the Church with the intention of scattering and destroying the whole body. It was so in the days of Jesus Christ the enemies sought to kill him that the body might be destroyed, which was also the case in the days of Elijah, Daniel, and many of the ancients. I once herd a man say who was opposed to this work that it might be true but it gave Jo Smith power, true said I but if his power be subordinate to the power of God it is right If a man set up a kingdom by the power of God then let others seek power from the same source God sets up kingdoms and pulls down kingdoms this makes men mad that will not submit to the kingdom of God. We all know the result of the power of Moses who was the representative of God. Judging from what is past how will it be when God sets up his kingdom in the last days whether their is a conspiracy now or not I dont know, but no doubt their will be if not know for it has always been so. In the days of the Nephites they had their Gadianton robers. I have not any doubt but that the apostates will join with the others wicked powers to try to put down the power of God. and I am glad to have the power of the kingdom of God tested and when it is fully tried it will stand, I care not what sacrifice I am called to make for such a kingdom, if its friends, welth or even life at the purchase of such a kingdom it is cheap, did the ancient Apostles, Prophets or Saints who died pay two much for that kingdom they did not. It is necessary that men be put in possession of the   ENDENTRY knowledge and mysteries of the kingdom of God in order to sin as far as they wish that they may go to the highest pitch. How often men lay down their lives for their country and other purposes, much better then to die for the cause of God. Good and righteous men will administer justice and rebuke evil and the church should be clensed from bad men and the Lord will take his own way to clens the Church, we should lift up our voice against wickedness of all kinds, but will the rulers of our land do it no they will not, they will be cowards untill their is no man to fight and then be brave when goverment will not do it some man should take the helm of government that will do it, will it be called treason if the God of heaven should set up a kingdom, may the Lord give you more and more of his spirit light and intelligence untill you are cemented together in union and love Amen   President S Rigdon arose and addressed the assembly in an interesting manner for a length of time the following are a few Items of his remarks. If according to the remarks in the morning a conspiracy does exhist with the persons that have been named, it is one of those kind of associations that could not exhist in any thing except against the kingdom of God. A word concerning power. History refers us back beyound civilization in treating upon this subject In consequence of power, their is strength and glory whare their is no power it is like flies without any order or rule. I have viewed the nations of the earth and the way they are relaxing in power and the course they are persuing one hundred years will not pass away till there would not be a man or woman on the earth, and nothing but the hand of God can save it, and this is why God would send Elijah   ENDENTRY to do his work, for all the power the nations will soon have is to destroy each other, for soon nation will be against nation party against party the rich against the poor and the poor against the rich untill they are destroyed from under heaven Tradition says the pope destroyed the church of God. Rome followed the Church as long as their was a saint and now you say the pope killed fifty millions of Christians you lie sir their was not a Christian on Earth, for when rome killed the kChristians and would not have God rule they wanted a pope and God gave them one or permitted them to have one and he killed fifty millions. its true but they were not Christians for they wer already dead, but it was of their own number ownly differed from them in sentiment here was power with a vengance. But as soon as God sends a man to use the power of God, then they are afraid of power. now the world says the religion of Jesus shed this blood and the bible andc but men must be vary ignorant of the bible and the religion of Jesus Christ too, to say such things for it was for the want of religion and the bible that caused the blood to be shed, for God Jesus Christ nor religion had any more hand in it than you had. The power of God and Jesus Christ and religion would have saved if they had had it.   President Joseph Smith again arose and said In relation to the power over the minds of the mankind which I hold, I would say it is in consequence of the power of truth in the doctrins which I have been an instrument in the hands of God of presenting unto them and not because of any compulsion on my part. I will ask if I ever got any of it unfair. If I have   ENDENTRY not reproved you in the gate. I ask did I ever exercise any compulsion over any man. did I not give him the liberty of disbelieveing any doctrin I have preached if he saw fit, why do not my enemies strike a blow at the doctrin, they cannot do it, it is truth, And I am as the voice of one crying in the wilderness repent of your sins and prepare the way for the coming of the son of Man, for the kingdom of God has come unto you and henceforth the ax is laid unto the root of the tree, and evry tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, God Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down and cast it into the fire.)

The way to get along in  any important matters was to gather unto  yourself wise men experienced and aged men  to assist in Council in all times of trouble  handsome men are not oft wise and strongminded  men but the strength of a strong minded  man will create corse features like the rough and  strong bough of the oak.

A man can bear a heavy burdben by practice  and continueing to increase it. The inhabitants  of this continant anciently were so constituted  and were so determined and persevering either  in righteousness or wickedness that God  visited them immediately either with great  Judgments or blessings.

Adams gave his testimony against winchester then Elder Winchester followed Adams and  both spoke several times then President Joseph  Smith arose and rebuked Elder Winchester in  the sharpest manner said he had a lying  spirit and had lied about him and told him of many  of his errors after hearing the testimony Elder  B Young President of the quorum of the Twelve  said he had made up his mind and his decision was  that Elder Winchester should give up his licence and  cease Preaching untill he should reform, President  H Smith said he should not like to have such a  decision given without another trial and give Elder  Winchester a chance to get more testimony if  he could, President Young said he should then  prefer to have case turned over to the High Council President Joseph Smith said it was not the  business of the High Council they could not try  him it belonged to the Twelve and them alone  for it was concerning matters abroad and not  in Nauvoo. The high Council was to trye  cases that belong to the City and the Twelve to  regulate the churches and Elders abroad in all  the world and Elder winchester case comes  under the Jurisdiction of the Twelve and them alone  President H Smith urged that the case should  be put off untill tomorrow President J.

Smith  said he would give us a little council if we saw  fit to except it, he thought it proper for us to  silence elder winchester take his lisence and  have him come to Nauvoo and if he would not  do that let him go out of the Church, it  was then Mooved and seconded that Elder  winchester be silenced and give up his lisence  and come with his family to Nauvoo which was  carried unanimously Br Joseph then addressed the Twelve  and said that in all our councils esspecially  while on trial of any one we should see and   ENDENTRY observe all things appertaining to the  subject and disern the spirit by which either  party was governed we should be in a  situation to understand evry spirit and  Judge wrighteous judgment and not be  asleep we shhould keep order and not  let the Council be imposed upon by  unruly conduct.

He took for the foundation  of his discourse the words of Jesus to the  Jews how oft would I have gatherd you  togetherd as a hen gathereth her chickens under  wings But ye would not andc. He then asked  what was the object of Gathering the Jews  together or the people of God in any age of the  world, the main object was to build unto the   ENDENTRY Lord an house whereby he could reveal  unto his people the ordinances of his house  and glories of his kingdom and teach the peopl the ways of salvation for their are certain  ordinances and principles that when they are  taught and practized, must be done in a place  or house built for that purpose this was  purposed in the mind of God before the  world was and it was for this purpose that God  designed to gather together the Jews oft  but they would not it is for the same  purpose that God gathers together the people  in the last ^days^ to build unto the Lord an house to  prepare them for the ordinances and endowments  washings and anointings andc one of the  ordinances of the house of the Lord is Baptism  for the dead, God decreed before the foundation  of the world that that ordinance should  be administered in a house prepared for that  purpose. If a man gets the fulness of God he has  to get it in the same way that Jesus Christ obta- ined it and that was by keeping all the ordin- ances of the house of the Lord. Men will  say I will never forsake you but will  stand by you at all times but the moment  you teach them some of the mysteries of God  that are retained in the heavens and are  to be revealed to the children of men when  they are prepared, They will be the first  to stone you and put you to death. It was the  same principle that crusified the Lord  Jesus Christ. I will say sumthing about the  Spirits in prision, theire has been much  said about the sayings of Jesus on the cross  to the thief saying this day thou shalt  be with me in paradise. The commentators  ENDENTRY make or translators make it out to say  Paradise but what is Paradise it is a modern  word it does not answer at all to the original  that Jesus made use of, their is nothing  in the original in any language that signif- ies Paradise. But it was this day I will  be with thee in the world of spirits and will  teach thee or answer thy inquiries. The  thief on the cross was to be with Jesus  Christ in the world of spirits he did not  say Paradise or heaven. The doctrin  of Baptism for the dead is clearly shown  in the new testament and if the doctrin  is not good then throw away the new testa ment but if it is the word of God then  let the doctrin be acknowledged and it was  one reason why Jesus said how oft would  I have gatherd you (the Jews) together  that they might attend to the ordinance  of the baptism for the dead as well as  the other ordinances the Priesthood  Revelations andc. This was the case on the  day of Pentecost these blessings were  poured out upon the deciples, on that  occasion.  Their has been also much  said about the word Hell and the sectarian  world have preached much about it  but what is hell, it is annother modern  term it is taken from hades, the greek  or shaole, the (hebrew) and the true sig- nification is a world of spirits,  Hades shaole paradise, spirits in prision  is all one it is a world of spirits, the  righteous and the wicked all go to the same  world of spirits   ENDENTRY but says one I believe in one hell and one  heaven all are equally miserable or equally  happy, but St Paul informs us of three  glories and three heavens he knew a man  caught up to the third heavens, and Jesus  said their were many mansions in my  Fathers kingdom. Any man may believe  Jesus Christ is good and be happy in it and yet  not obey his commands and at last be cut  down by his righteous commandmends  A man of God should be endowed with  all wisdom knowledge and understanding  in order to teach and lead people. The blind  may lead the blind and both fall into the  deatch together;   Their is much  said concerning God the Godhead andc  the scripture says their is Gods many and  Lords many, the teachers of the day  say that the father is God the son is God  and the Holy Ghost is God and that they are  all in one body and one God. Jesus says or  prays that those that the father had  given him out of the world might be  made one in us as we, are one, but if  they were to be stuffed into one person  they would make a great God. If I  were to testify that the world was  wrong on this point it would be  true. Peter says that Jesus Christ  sat on the right hand of God any  person that has seen the heavens  opened knows that their is three  personages in the heavens holding   ENDENTRY the keys of power. As the father  hath power in himself so the Son  hath power, in himself then the  father has some day laid down his body  and taken it again ^so he has a body of his own^ So has his Son a body of  his own so each one will be in their own  body. Many of the sects cry out O I  have the testimony of Jesus I have the spirit  of God. But away with Jo Smith he says he  is a Prophet But their is to be no Prophets  nor revelations in the last days; But  stop sir the Revelator says that the testimony  of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so by your  own mouth you are condemned.   But to the text why gather the people together  in this place for the same purpose that  Jesus wanted to gather the Jews, to receive  the ordinances, the blessings and the glories  that God has in store for his Saints.

He took grounds to  prove that Charity consisted in doing that  for others which they could not do for them- selves for instance Jesus Christ died to  Redeem the world, the world could not  Redeem itself this is Charity, if our  fore fathers and Mothers and kindred have died  without the gospel, and we embrace the  gospel in our day and generation and can redeem  our relatives By being Baptized for them  they being dead that they may have part  in the first resurrection, should we do this  it would be Charity for we should do for  ENDENTRY them what they could not do for themselvs  and this was wherein The Apostle said why then  are ye baptized for the dead if the dead  rise not, this is far greater than faith and  hope for though we might Believe ^and hope^ our friend  might be redeemed yet if we was not  Baptized for them they might remain in  Hell and our faith and hope do them no good  but to do that for another which he can  do for himself is not Charity.
