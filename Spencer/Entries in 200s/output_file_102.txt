 many not yet comprehended, we believe  it will be apparent to all that to make  the organization still more effective in a  truly educational sense, some material sup-  port at this stage of its history is a practi-  cal necessity.    It is, therefore, desired that each mem-  ber contribute fifty cents a year; thus  establishing a general Mutual Improve-  ment fund, which will provide for the  publication and free distribution of the  new Roll and Record book, and uni-  form report blanks. The Roll and Re-  cord book has been prepared under our  direction by the committee compiling the  Manual. It provides for (1) individual  credit of attendance and exercises; (2)  general summary of all work done; (3)  a complete ward report; (4) a visitors'  register; and its use is essential to the  progress of each association.    This fund will also provide for ex-  penses of other incidental publications,  and special educational work among the  associations, which, as you readily now  see, is indispensable.    We feel assured that if the matter is  laid before the members in the true spirit  of Mutual Improvement it will not only  be heartily responded to, but be an imme-  diate and continuous means of increasing  and maintaining a still greater interest in  the noble work.    All funds should be sent, with names of  donors accompanying, direct to the Gen-  eral Treasurer, Wm. S. Burton, Salt  Lake City, Utah, who will send a printed  receipt to each individual for the  amount of his donation, and also give  each individual credit on the general re-  cord.    Your brethren and co-laborers in the  cause of Mutual Improvement,    Wilford Woodruff,  Joseph F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher.    General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A.  SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Nov. 14th, 1891. 
 I wish my young brethren to keep in  mind that our aim is high. We are  aiming for a place in the celestial king-  dom of God, to obtain eternal life, the  greatest of all the gifts of God to man.  All the honor, glory and wealth of this  world should sink into insignificance in  our minds in comparison with an inherit-  ance in the presence of God and the  Lamb, with all the prophets, apostles  and saints, including our father's house.  While one is fleeting and soon passeth  away, the other endureth forever.    The Lord has said by revelation that  there are but two churches, one is the  Church of God, and the other is the  church of the Devil, and all who do not  belong to the Church of God belong to  the church of the Devil. None but the  Elders of the true Church of Christ will  preach the true Gospel of Christ. There  is but one Gospel of Christ, never was  and never will be but one. St. Paul  said: "Though we, or an angel from  heaven, preach any other Gospel unto  you, than that which we have preached  unto you, let him be accursed." That  Gospel is a gospel of faith in Jesus  Christ, repentance of sins, baptism in  water by immersion for the remission of  sins, and the reception of the Holy  Ghost by the laying on of hands. This  Holy Ghost is the testimony of the  Father and the Son, and is promised to  all those who receive the Gospel and  obey its ordinances.    I wish all our young people to become  thoroughly acquainted with these first  principles of the Gospel of Christ, and  become qualified to teach them to their  fellowmen. I pray God, my Heavenly  Father, to bless and sustain all the  teachers, superintendents and members  of the Primaries, Sabbath Schools and  Mutual Improvement Associations, and  that the rising generation of the Latter-  day Saints in these mountains may be  inspired to pursue that course, whereby  they will honor God and their parents,  and be counted worthy to stand in the  flesh at the coming of the Son of Man,  and be prepared to meet the Lord when  He comes in the clouds of heaven, with  power and great glory, to reward every  man according to the deeds done in  the body, which is the earnest prayer of  your brother in the New and Everlasting  Covenant.

 "Gentlemen of the Congress:    "I feel myself very thankful that I have  lived in the flesh long enough in this Ter-  ritory to behold the faces of such a con-  gregation of gentlemen as I see here to-  day. It is not my purpose to occupy your   time or attention in arguing or talking or  conversing particularly upon the subjects  or at least those principles for which you  have gathered together; but what I will  say will be a few words concerning our   arrival here, and upon the principal of irri-  gation. Fifty-one years ago the twenty-  fourth of last July, I entered this valley  with one hundred and forty-three immi-  grants, or in other words pioneers. We   were led by President Young. This coun-  try that we arrived upon was called the  Great American Desert, and certainly as  far as we could see it did not deviate from  that in the least. We found a barren   desert here. There was no mark of the   Anglo-Saxon race, no mark of the white-  man; everything was barren, dry and   desert.    "We pitched our camp a little distance   to the southeast from here about eleven  o'clock in the day. We had a desire to   try the soil to know what it could produce.  Of course all this company—nearly the   whole of us were born and raised in the   New England states, Vermont, Maine,   Massachusetts, Connecticut—had no ex-  perience in irrigation. We pitched our  camp, put some teams onto our   plows (we brought our plows with   us) and undertook to plough the earth,   but we found neither wood nor iron were   strong enough to make furrows here  in this hard soil. It was like adamant. Of   course we had to turn water on it. We   would have done anything. We went  and turned out City creek. We  turned over our ground. When we came  to put our teams upon it, of course they   sunk down to their bellies in mud. We  had to wait until this land dried enough  to hold our teams up. We put in our   crops and we stayed here one month.  During that time President Young laid   out this city as you see it today in the   midst of sage-brush with not a house   within hundreds of miles of us. We   built a fort around ten acres, three sides  of adobe walls eighteen feet high, and one   side with logs out of the canyon. We  then returned home and some two thou-  sand men followed us. President Can-  non here was one of the company that   came in after we did.    "Now what I wish to say is this: You   gentlemen come here today; you see the  city, you go through the country. Here   are a thousand miles, I might say, through  these mountains filled with cities, towns,   villages, gardens and orchards, and the   products of the earth that sustain the   people. Without this water, this irriga-  tion for which you have met here to-day,  this country would be as barren as it was  in 1847 as we found it. This irrigation is   what you have met to engage in and give  your views upon. How I am satisfied it  matters not. Whatever you decide upon  in this matter and unite upon, I am  satisfied it will prove a great blessing; not  only to Utah but to every state and ter-  ritory where these arid lands are, and  whoever occupies these lands of course   has got to have the water to perform the  work. We have had to do the same.    We have had to learn by experience and 
 President Wilford Woodruff then ad-  dressed the conference. He said in sub-  stance: No man occupying the place   that I do at this time, addressing a body  of Latter-day Saints, could answer his  own mind or the minds of those who hear  except by the inspiration of Almighty   God and the assistance of the Holy  Ghost. If I were to tell this congregation  which has assembled together as a Mu- 
 mony with, and recognized as a practical   help in each ward?    Did you confer freely and fully with   the Presidency of your stake in superin-  tending the M.I.A. work last year?    Are you personally acquainted with   the education status and progress of   each Association in your stake?    Is there a general sentiment in your   stake for the officers to remain faithful   to their work until honorably released?    See CONTRIBUTOR, Vol. XI., page 471,   also enclosed questions with circular  letter of March 17th, 1891, and address,   CONTRIBUTOR, Vol. IX., pages 38-40.    It will be well for you to plan for hold-  ing your annual meeting for sustaining   officers in each ward as soon as possible;   but the regular weekly meetings should   be started up promptly, early in Septem-  ber by the present officers, who should   not wait for the annual meeting. At the   annual meeting it is desirable that the   Stake Superintendency should be pres-  ent. This meeting should be made   general in the ward, and the importance,   plan, and purpose of mutual improve-  ment work should be brought clearly  and forcibly before the people, and the  ward officers sustained by the vote of   the Saints. If for any cause changes   are to be made or vacancies filled they  should be attended to at this meeting.    In the selection of officers the ward  authorities should be fully conferred with   and great care taken to choose such   persons as are fitted for the positions by   popularity, ability, and inclination to do  the work required.    As will be seen from the Manual, special  instructions are given to the members,   and each class of officers for their general   guidance; to this your attention is directed.    As you are aware this great organiza-  tion is of such a character that its direct-  ing, teaching, training influence extends   to the home reading, or preparation of   the individual member around the fire-  side; thence to his regular weekly pro-  gressive lesson or exercise; thence to   the monthly joint session; thence to   the district and stake conferences, and   culminating in the general annual con-  ference in June each year. Thus making  the line of organized work practically  complete and progressive.    You are also cognizant of the special   importance of regular, systematic, pro-  gressive reading, thinking, and acting on  the part of the individual member; thus  permanently impressing and establishing   him in this universal system of educa-  tion, based upon revelation, self-culture,   and mutual or associative effort and   relation.    Education as you know is the develop-  ment and use of one's entire self. In   other words, the accumulation and  proper application of physical, spiritual,   intellectual and moral power; or, the de-  velopment of correct thought and its ex-  pression in righteous words and actions.    (See CONTRIBUTOR, Vol XI, page 351.)    Praying the Lord to preserve, direct,  and prosper you in your work of love,  we remain your fellow-laborers in the   cause of Mutual Improvement,    Wilford Woodruff,  Joseph F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher. 
 house, and thus started on my mission  without purse or scrip. Brother Brigham  Young paddled me across the Mississippi  river in a canoe. The difficulties which  I, with the rest of the Apostles, passed  through in performing that journey to  England will never be told in history.  However, we all arrived in various com-  panies in England in compliance with  the commandments of God. We spent  the year 1840 in England, during which  time we preached the gospel and bap-  tized some seven thousand, organized  branches and conferences in England  and Scotland, inluding London and  Edinburgh. Eighteen hundred of this  number were brought into the Church  through my labors in Herefordshire,  Gloucesteshire and Worcestershire dur-  ing eight months, including nearly two  hundred preachers of the various denom-  inations. About fifty of the preachers  belonged to the six hundred of the  United Brethren who were baptized into  the Church. After performing this work,  and on the twenty-fifth of April, 1841 I  set sail for America on the ship Roches-  ter, with my brethren of the Twelve and  a large company of Saints, and arrived   at New York, May 20th.    My son Wilford was born at Nauvoo,  March 22nd, 1840, and my daughter Sarah  Emma died at Nauvoo, July 17th, 1840.    I left New York for Nauvoo, via the  lakes, and was on the steamer Chesapeake,  with my wife and child, when she was  wrecked on Lake Michigan, and all came  near being lost; but through the mercy  of God we were again preserved from  the perils of the waters. I arrived at  Nauvoo on the sixth of October, 1841,  where I again had the happy privilege of  meeting with the Prophet Joseph and  Apostles and my friends. I spent the  winter of 1841-2 in Nauvoo, attending  meetings and councils and laboring with  my hands for the support of myself and  family until the third of February, 1842,  at which time Joseph Smith called me to  take charge of the business department  of the printing office, which I attended  to until the twentieth of January, 1844,  when I left the office well supplied with  materials, in the hands of Elder John   Taylor. I received my endowments  with the Twelve under the direction of  the Prophet Joseph Smith in the winter  of 1843. In the spring of 1844, I was ap-  pointed a mission with most of the  Twelve to go through the Eastern States.  On the ninth of May, 1844, I took the  last parting hand with President Joseph  Smith in his own house with Brother  Jedediah M. Grant. He blessed me and   bade me God speed, but seemed very  sorrowful, as he did in parting with all  of the Twelve. I have since been satis-  fied that he had a presentiment that it was  his last parting with his brethren of the  Apostles. I attended a conference at  Boston, and on the twenty-seventh of  June, 1844, while at the railway depot in  Boston with Elder Brigham Young wait-  ing for trains to take us to Lowell, there  seemed to be a dark cloud and sorrowful  gloom come over us, which we could not  comprehend at the time. While I was  at Portland, Maine, and ready to step on  board a steamer for Fox Islands I saw  an account of the martyrdom of the  Prophet and his brother Hyrum, and the  Spirit bore record to me that it was true;  so I returned to Boston, where the  Twelve soon met together, and we  hastened to Nauvoo, when we found  the city enveloped in mourning.    After our return to Nauvoo, and set-  ting in order the Church, a council was  held, at which time I was appointed to  go to England and take charge of the  Church in that land. I arrived in Liver-  pool on the ship, John R. Skiddy, on  the third of January, 1845, in company  with my wife and youngest daughter;  also Brothers Hyrum Clark and wife,  Daniel Jones and wife, and Brothers  Milton Holmes and Leonard W. Hardy.  I spent the year 1845 in England attend-  ing to the duties devolving upon me.  During that year I published three  thousand copies of the Doctrine and  Covenants, and secured the copyright  in London, being the first European  edition, three thousand Hymn Books  and twenty thousand copies of the  proclamation of the Apostles. On the  twenty-first of January, 1846, I departed  from England on the packet ship, Ash- 
 all that we have obtained in these moun-  tains has been by irrigation. There are  portions yet which have not been irrigated,   and as one gentleman said here, if you   can make two drops of water where   there was one, or two spears of grass  where there was one you are benefactors  to mankind. I say God bless you in   your efforts. 
 be to prepare himself to dwell with his Father  and God in his presence. It is for this reason  that the millions of spirits that tabernacle  here are sent from the eternal worlds to pass  a short probation in mortal bodies, and they  are all the children of one father. If we re-  ceive the gospel and live its precepts we shall  receive celestial glory; if we reject it we shall  be punished; though we may have a redemp-  tion and a glory, but it will be in a diminshed  degree. We should lay these things to heart;  we should endeavor to understand our true  position, and we should do all in our power to  benefit our fellow man and to bring salvation  to the nations.    I rejoice that the Lord still holds the door  open, that we still have the privilege of send-  ing the Elders to the nations; while this door  remains open we shall continue to preach the  gospel to the gentile world. When they re-  ject it it will be taken from them and then we  go to the Jews, and the ten tribes will come   from the north to Zion to be crowned under  the hands of the children of Ephraim. And   the remnant of the Lamanites who are cursed  below all humanity that we are acquainted  with; who have been filled with the spirit of   bloodshed which they have inherited from  their fathers; they will embrace the gospel in  due time of the Lord. They are of the house  of Israel, and this spirit of war will be taken  from them and they will become the children  of God, but not until the gentiles have en-  tirely rejected the gospel. Anciently it was  preached to the Jews first and then to the  gentiles; in the latter times it will be first  preached to the gentiles and then to the Jews,  the first shall be last and the last first. This  is the great work which is laid upon us to-day.  We should be true and faithful to-day and  then we ought to follow this practice until  death, and then shall we be entitled to have  a crown of life. Is it not more honorable to  do good than to do evil; to try to honor and   serve God who is our Father and who has  given us every blessing than sin against him?  Would not such a course bring more happi-  ness and pleasure to us than to blaspheme the  name of God and dishonor ourselves, bringing  darkness and condemnation to our spirits?    I pray that God may bless us and save us  in his kingdom, which I ask in the name of  Jesus Christ: Amen. 
 tual Improvement Association of the   young men and maidens of Zion that I  was not deeply interested in your welfare,  I should deny the faith. Indeed the cir-  cumstances in which we are placed  causes me as well as my brethren to have  the deepest interest in the rising genera-  tion who dwell in the mountains of Israel.  I will tell you why: I realize the fact that  this world with all its kingdoms, thrones,  principalities, and powers, with all its   wealth, seas, rivers, lakes, its shipping,  telegraphs, railroads, its mines, its gold  and silver, the whole of it has to go into  the hands of the young men and maidens  who dwell upon this earth, who stand in  the midst of some fourteen hundred mil-  lions of the human family.    Had I the power to tell by the visions   of heaven, by the revelations of Jesus   Christ, what will take place when this  generation of young men and women  shall have passed through another thirty  years of this life, I do not think it would   be wisdom for me to reveal it to the   world. Nevertheless, I will say that no   generation of young people before this  has had greater evidence of the revolu-  tions, changes, sorrows or afflictions that  will overwhelm the world, that will over-  take the inhabitants of the earth, than   those which are to come to pass in their  time. The sorrowful fact is before us   that never in our history has such a flood   of crime and the power of the evil one   trying to destroy the children of men been   so rampant as now. One thousand mur-  ders are committed to-day upon the face  of the earth where there was a hundred,   years ago, or even when the Book of   Mormon was translated into the English   language by the servants of God. The  same in regard to suicides. Look at the   black catalogue of crime in our midst to-  day. Why, the world will not realize all  this unless they look at the signs of the  times, and read them. The signs of all  heaven and earth indicate to us that the  end is approaching—that the Son of Man   is at our very doors.    To the sons and daughters of Zion I  would say: I have done my mission to   the world. I have traveled far enough to  make a journey around the world six   times within the last fifty or sixty years of   my life in preaching the Gospel to the na-  tions of the earth. My mission is now  over in that respect, and in the few days  I have to spend here I want to use my   voice in the cause of the sons and daugh-  ters of Zion.    Those who have obeyed and served  God have always been unpopular with the  world, in every age, from the time of  Christ Himself. The Lord raised up a  Prophet in the nineteenth century. Joseph   Smith, the Prophet of God, labored with  us for fourteen years after he had orga-  nized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints; he established a work which  will stand until the coming of the Son of   Man. I myself have traveled with him  thousands of miles, and spent a great deal  of time in his company. But he is now on  the other side of the vail; so are also those  Apostles who were then with us, among   them Brigham Young, John Taylor, Geo.   A. Smith, the Pratts, and many among us   now will soon follow them. But the   Church and kingdom of God is here and   will remain to the end.    I would say to the young people of  Zion. "The God of heaven has laid upon   your shoulders the honor and responsi-  bility of bearing off this kingdom in your  day and generation. You are called to  build up Zion, to manifest your faith, to  keep the commandments of God, to ad-  minister in the ordinances of the House  of God both for the living and the dead.  This is the work your fathers have laid   upon you. Rise up an[d] magnify your call-  ing prepare yourselves for the great work   of God Almighty which rests upon you.   If you are unpopular and persecuted—  what of it? What if your names are cast   out as evil among men? There is a God   in Israel. He holds your destiny as well   as that of all nations under heaven, and  He will not fail or disappoint any of His  Saints." To those who are engaged in   the primaries, in Sabbath schools, in  young men's and young women's mutual  improvement associations, let me say,   "We cannot be divided in these matters."   Having spoken of the excellent work  which these institutions had accomplished  in the past, President Woodruff alluded to 
 Elder Milton H. Hardy, Provo, Utah:    DEAR BROTHER: We are advised that  the condition of the Young Men's Mutual  Improvement Associations, throughout  the Church, is such as to require careful  consideration and attention from its  general officers; and in our capacity, as  the General Superintendency of the  organization, we feel it our duty to extend  to the Associations such encouragement  and counsel, as may be necessary to pro-  mote their welfare, and put them in the  way of securing, to the young men of  Israel, the blessings that are in store for  them; and that can be secured unto them  through the medium of these Associations,  which have been organized by the coun-  sel of the Priesthood, under the inspira-  tion of the Holy Spirit, for their especial   benefit.    The organization, as originally given  and generally maintained, is one capable  of securing to all its members (and its  membership should include all the young  men of Zion) a taste for theological,  historical, scientific, and literary studies;  such as should characterize the intelligent  youth of a community of Latter-day  Saints.    It is the mission of these Associations  to take the lead in this direction, and  their officers should seek for that knowl-  edge and spirit, which will qualify them  as leaders, in directing the work of their  respective Associations.    From your long connection with Mutual  Improvement Associations, and the deep  interest you have always taken in them,  we feel that you are qualified to represent  us, in the detail labor, which we deem at 
 burton, with Elder Joseph A. Stratton,  for New York. We had an exceedingly  rough passage of forty-three days. It  was said to be the roughest passage  known up to that time. We had seven  hurricanes and fourteen gales and lost  the second mate overboard.    Arrived at New York on the sixth of  March, 1846. My wife and daughter  had gone on board ship at Liverpool  with a company of Saints, on her jour-  ney to Nauvoo, via New Orleans. I left  New York and visited my father's home  in Farmington, Conn., and notified them  to be prepared to accompany me to  Nauvoo. I also visited Ezra Carter and  family, my father-in-law at Scarborough,  Maine, and I took my daughter Phebe,  who had been left there and returned to  Connecticut. My father, stepmother,  and cousin, Betsey Cosset, accompanied  me to Nauvoo, where I again met my  wife, who had arrived safely from Liver-  pool.    I attended the dedication of the  Nauvoo Temple with Orson Hyde, on  the twentieth day of April, 1846, whilst  the most of the Twelve and many of the  Saints, led by President Brigham Young,  had crossed the Mississippi river and  were traveling west.    I crossed the Mississippi river with my  family for the last time on the nineteenth  of May, 1846, and started west to over-  take the main camp. We arrived at  Mount Pisgah, where there was a large  body of the Saints, on the fifteenth of   June. I here found Elder Lorenzo  Snow, apparently at the point of death,  and administered to him. On the twenty-  fifth of June I was met by Captain Allen,  who had come to visit the camp of the  Saints to raise a Battalion to go to  war with Mexico. I directed him to  the portion of the camp where President  Young was, and he immediately raised  the Mormon Battalion of five hundred  men. I consented for every teamster I  had to go to make up the number,  as did others. We formed our encamp-  ment for the winter on the west side of  the Missouri river, which we named  Winter Quarters. On the fifteenth of   October I met with a very severe acci-  dent. An oak tree fell upon me and  broke my breast bone and several ribs,  which came near killing me; but through  the administration of the Elders and the  blessings of God, I was preserved. In   the Spring of 1847 I accompanied Presi-  dent Young with some of the Twelve  and the pioneer camp of one hundred  and forty-three persons in crossing the   plains to the Great Salt Lake Valley,  where we built a Fort, laid out the site  of Salt Lake City and Temple Block   and returned to Winter Quarters the  same season. -[The history of which  has been frequently published.]-    In the spring of 1848, I took my wife  and children, by appointment, and went  east to Boston to gather up all the  Saints in the New England States, and  take them to the Rocky Mountains. I  labored in this capacity until the spring  of 1850, and sent out several companies.  I visited all the branches of the Church   in New England and New Brunswick,  and organized the last company and led  them myself from Boston to St. Louis,  Council Bluffs, and on to Salt Lake City,  arriving in October, 1850, at which time  I settled my family, including my father,  in the City of Salt Lake, where I have  spent the past thirty-eight years of my  life, attending to the duties of my calling  as an Apostle, in the building and dedi-  cation of temples, administering in the   ordinances of the Gospel therein, and  preaching to the Saints and providing  for my family. I have been deeply inter-  ested in the redemption of my dead.   Through my own labors and the assistance  of my friends I have been enabled to   give endowments to some three thousand  of my dead relatives of my father's and  mother's house. Among other labors I  have officiated as a member of the Utah  Legislature for twenty-two sessions,  twenty of which were in the Legislative  Council.    I have traveled to Idaho, Colorado,  New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and  California. Since my arrival in the  valley of Salt Lake, eleven Apostles and  two Presidents of the Church have de-  parted this life and passed behind the  vail. On the death of President John

 THE following letter has been issued by  the general superintendency, and will be   sent to M.I. superintendents and presi-  dents.    SALT LAKE CITY, October 25, 1892.    DEAR BROTHER: You know from the   circular letter sent you from this office  dated Nov. 14, 1891, that a working fund  is necessary, the object of which is plainly  set forth in that letter.    Every young man interested in educa-  tion and general improvement was called  upon to contribute the nominal sum of  fifty cents per annum.    The plan of this universal system of  education, notwithstanding the great  amount of time, means and skilled  labor required, is intended to be, as far  as possible, self-helpful, and it should   be self-sustaining.    Since the conditions enjoined have not   been complied with, there must be some  objections, or lack of interest, or dearth   of responsibility, or non-conversion to  mutual improvement. To meet these  supposed objections we will enumer-  ate: (1) Every association receives a   Roll and Record, an expensive book,   as you know, free; (2) Every member   receives a "Manual," a book of ninety-  two pages, the usual price of which is   fifty cents, free; (3) You receive blanks,   circular letters and so forth, free; (4)   THE MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT NORMAL  TRAINING COURSE has been established  in the Brigham Young Academy at   Provo, consisting of more than three  hundred (300) regular progressive re-  lated lessons under special professors,  the regular cost of which is not less  than ten ($10) dollars to each student.   All this, with many other privileges, is  free to M.I. students, and its benefits  are applicable to the smallest and most   remote wards as well as the larger and  more central ones; (5) Stake classes  are also conducted free. No one can   fail to see that the contribution named   is a good investment, even from a busi-  ness standpoint, as that which he may   receive is many times the amount which  he is asked to contribute.    By a general response we shall be   able not only to continue, but also   greatly extend this educative work, and  it is equally the privilege and duty of   every young man to pursue and prac-  tically support it.    From the foregoing presentation it is  clear that the nominal sum of fifty cents  per year from persons thus provided for  cannot be looked upon in any other light   than that of a blessed privilege, and in no  way a burden.    We trust you will lead off in this mat-  ter and inspire others with the same  spirit of gratitude and generosity.    Your brethren and fellow-laborers,    Wilford Woodruff,  Joseph F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher,    General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A. 
 present necessary to be performed, for  their best interests. We, therefore, take  pleasure in appointing you to this mis-  sion, as our representative; to visit the   Associations, holding such meetings of  the officers, and such public meetings, as  may be necessary, to instruct and   acquaint all who are interested, in the  plan and purpose of this great organiza-  tion.    We commend you to the consideration  of all the officers of the Associations, to  Presidents of Stakes and Bishops, and   ask their cordial co-operation in promot-  ing the object of your mission; and we  bless you and ask our Father in Heaven  to bless and inspire you with the spirit  and power of this calling, in the name   of Jesus, Amen.    Your brethren,  (Signed),    Wilford Woodruff,  Jos. F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher,    General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A.  Nov. 14, 1890. 
 Y.M.M.I.A. MISSIONARIES.    The following letter to Stake Superin-  tendency has been issued by the General   Superintendency,    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,    Sept. 5th, 1892.    DEAR BROTHER: We desire a number  of representative young men to continue  the general missionary work among the  Improvement Associations.    You will therefore please confer at once  with the Presidency of your Stake and  with their indorsement select the names  of . . . . . . . . . representative young   men with ability and inclination to per-  form missionary labor.    Forward these names to this office  without delay that the First Presidency  may have time to consider them before  their names are presented to the general   conference in October next. Their en-  tire time will be required in the field, the   first five weeks of which will be prepar-  atory work in the M.I. Normal Course,   and the remainder of the three months  devoted to traveling and laboring among  the young men of the Associations in Zion.    In making this selection endeavor to   take men from the M.I. ranks, avoiding  interference with the Sunday School   interests, and see that they have the   full indorsement of their Bishop, and  that they can and will devote themselves  exclusively to filling this mission.    Your fellow laborers,    W. Woodruff,  Jos. F. Smith,  Moses Thatcher,    Gen[era]l. Sup[erin]t[enden]cy. Y.M.M.I.A.    Address: Geo D. Pyper,    Secretary Y.M.M.I.A.,    P.O. Box 520.

 the Relief Societies, which he said had   been a great blessing to this people.    It has not unfrequently been said by   this and other nations, "You Mormons   are not fit to live." Hard things have   been said against us; and there have been   so many lies told about us that nobody   knows what is truth.    Some time ago I came down here with  a whole car load of ministers on their way   to attend a conference, and as we passed   by the Sixteenth Ward schoolhouse one of   the gentlemen sitting at my side remark-  ed, "Mr. Woodruff, what is that build-  ing?" I replied that it was one of our   schools. "Schools!" he exclaimed, "do   you have schoolhouses?" I replied that  we certainly had—that we had twenty   Church schoolhouses in this city. "Why!"  he rejoined, "I am surprised; I did not   know before that you 'Mormons' had a  schoolhouse; I did not even know that you  taught anybody!" A man of his standing   should have known better but that is just  the way with the world today.    Do not be discouraged or fear that the   Lord will fail any of you. This kingdom   will increase in power and glory, the king-  dom of God will increase until all those  gathered together are prepared for the   coming of the Son of Man.    God bless you and all those who are   laboring in these Societies. You are up-  on a good mission. Here you have  an army of young men, maidens and  children; to save them is your mission,  and God will bless you in it. May our  heavenly father pour out his spirit upon  Zion, prepare Jerusalem for the return of   the Jews, gather together the scattered  from the nations of the earth, and prepare   all for the coming of the Son of Man. 
 DEAR BRETHREN: The Brigham   Young Academy Normal Summer School   holds its regular annual session at Provo,  beginning Monday, August 7th, and con-  tinuing two weeks.    We have made arrangements with the   faculty for a special course of instruction   for officers of the Young Men's Mutual   Improvement Associations.    We desire you to send one young man   suitable as a M.I. officer from each Ward   in your Stake, and one representative   from the Superintendency of your Stake,   to take this course of instruction at   Provo.    Forward his name direct to us, Box B,   and two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) to   the General Treasurer, William S. Bur-  ton, 118 South, Second West Street, Salt   Lake City. This amount will assist in de-  fraying the expenses and will be credited   to the association thus represented on its   M.I. fifty cent fund.    Please give this your prompt attention,   as the names should be in by the fifteenth   of July.    Expecting a ready and full response,    We remain,    Your brethren and fellow laborers,    Wilford Woodruff,   Geo. Q. Cannon,  Jos. F. Smith,    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 Taylor, the responsibility of presiding   over the Church fell upon me, in con-  nection with the Twelve Apostles.    At the close of this sketch I wish to   say a few words to my young friends. I   have had experience and testimony suffi-  cient in my life to satisfy me, beyond a   doubt, of the truth of the fulness of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to   Joseph Smith, whom the Lord raised up   to lay the foundation of His Church and   Kingdom of God upon the earth, in this  the last dispensation of the fulness of   times. Mormonism, so-called, is true.   The truth of which this generation will  learn when they come before God to  judgment, if not before. All the revela-  tions of God as proclaimed in the Bible,  Book of Mormon and Doctrine and  Covenants will have their fulfilment in  their appointed time. Not one jot nor   tittle will fall unfulfilled. Darkness   covers the earth and gross darkness the   people, and infidelity reigns in a great   measure among the children of men;   but the greatest infidel that lives will find  a God when he gets into the spirit world,  and a just Judge, who will judge all men   with a righteous judgment, and reward  every one according to the deeds done  in the body. Woe unto all men, who   reject the testimony of Jesus Christ   and persecute the Saints of God, no   matter in what age of the world they   may live.    I wish to say to the young men in Zion,  you have a great destiny before you,   both in this world and in the world to  come. You have a long eternity  awaiting you and a great responsibility.   As your fathers are passing away the   labor of the Church and Kingdom of   God will rest upon you. I have confi-  dence in you, to believe that you will   qualify yourselves for the great duty and  work which lies before you. The des-  tiny of the Church and Kingdom of   God in the latter days is decreed by the  God of Heaven, and I do not believe  that God has made that decree without   preparing an element to do His work, in   carrying out His purposes.    Therefore, I say to the young men of   the Mutual Improvement Associations,   that the God of Israel has called, chosen  and ordained you as messengers of life  and salvation, to qualify yourselves to   prune the vineyard for the last time and   labor while it is called day and prepare  for the coming of the Son of Man.    That God may bless you to this end,   is the earnest prayer of your brother and  fellow laborer in the Church and king-  dom of God.    Wilford Woodruff. 
 His angels charge concerning us and   they do all in their power for our  salvation."    15. In the testimony of a life-  time addressed to the Y.M.M.I.A.  he said: "I have confidence in you   to believe that you will qualify your-  selves for the great duty and work  that lie before you." After tonight   may he feel the same confidence in  the young ladies.    16. "This work depends on no   man or set of men; God can and will   fill any man's place who proves him-  self unworthy, and He will permit no   man to lead this people astray."    17. "The spirit of revelation   belongs to the Priesthood."    18. "We are blessed with power   and authority to redeem both the   living and the dead."    19. "The Lord is determined to   raise up a people that will worship   Him, and if He has to whip and   scourge and drive us through a   whole generation, He will chastise  us until we are willing to submit to   righteousness and truth, or until we   are like clay in the hands of the  potter."    20. "I would exhort my young  friends not to cherish selfishness, but   if you have any, get rid of it as soon   as possible. Be generous and kind-  hearted to all, especially to your   parents."    21. "It is better to suffer stripes  for the testimony of Christ than to  fall by our sins and transgressions  and then have to suffer afterwards."    22. "I have been a member of  the Church over sixty years, one of  the apostles fifty-five years, and the  president for a short time, and I  have never performed any ordinance   without the assistance of the Holy   Ghost."    23. "The time is here when the  veil shall be lifted, and the hearts of  the young men and women shall be  turned to the work of the Lord."    24. "This Gospel has caused   prophets, elders, and saints to re-  joice. It has nerved up their spirits   with fortitude and strength, and   borne them up against every oppos-  ing influence; this has been the case   in every dispensation when this light   and power have been enjoyed by the   children of men."    25. "I knew the Prophet Joseph   both in public and in private, have   worshiped with him, and run horse   races with him over the public   square, and in every duty of life he  was a man to be loved and revered." 
    To the Officers and Members of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:    The near approach of the date for the dedi-  cation of the Temple of our God moves us to  express with some degree of fullness our feelings   to our brethren, the officers of the Church, who   with us bear the Priesthood of the Son of God,   and to the Latter-day Saints generally; to the  end that in entering that holy building we may   all be found acceptable ourselves, with our  households, and that the building which we shall  dedicate may also be acceptable unto the Lord.    The Latter-day Saints have used their means   freely to erect other temples in these valleys,   and our Father has blessed us in our efforts.   Today we enjoy the great happiness of having  three of these sacred structures completed,  dedicated to and accepted of the Lord, wherein  the Saints can enter and attend to those ordi-  nances which He, in His infinite goodness and   kindness, has revealed. But for forty years the  hopes, desires, and anticipations of the entire   Church have been centered upon the comple-  tion of this edifice in the principal city of Zion.  Its foundation was laid in the early days of our  settlement in these mountains; and from that  day until the present, the eyes of the members  of the Church in every land have been lovingly   directed toward it. Looking upon it as the  Temple of temples, the people during all these  years have labored with unceasing toil, undi-  minished patience, and ungrudging expenditure  of means to bring it to its present condition of   completion; and now that the toils and the  sacrifices of forty years are crowned so success-  fully and happily; now that the great building  is at last finished and ready to be used for   divine purposes, need we say that we draw near  an event whose consummation is to us as a  people momentous in the highest degree? Far-  reaching in its consequences, as that occasion   is certain to be, what remains for us to say in   order to impress the entire Church with a sense   of its tremendous importance?    On this point, surely nothing; yet may we  offer a few words upon a phase that directly   touches it. No member of the Church who   would be deemed worthy to enter that sacred  house can be considered ignorant of the prin-  ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much to pre-  sume that every one knows what his duty is to  God and to his fellowman. None is so forgetful  as to have lost sight of the admonition that we  must be filled with love for and charity toward  our brethren. And hence none can for a   moment doubt the supreme importance of every   member of the congregation being at peace with  all his or her brethren and sisters, and at peace  with God. How else can we hope to gain the  blessings He has promised save by complying  with the requirements for which those blessings   are the reward!    Can men and women who are violating a law   of God, or those who are derelict in yielding   obedience to His commands, expect that the  mere going into His holy house and taking part   in its dedication will render them worthy to   receive, and cause them to receive, His blessing?    Do they think that repentance and turning  away from sin may be so lightly dispensed with?    Do they dare, even in thought, thus to accuse   our Father of injustice and partiality, and attrib-  ute to Him carelessness in the fulfillment of His  own words?    Assuredly no one claiming to belong to His   people would be guilty of such a thing.    Then must those who are unworthy cease to  expect a blessing from their attendance at the  Temple while sin unrepented of still casts its   odor about them, and while bitterness or even  an unforgiving coolness exists in their hearts   against their brethren and sisters.    On this latter subject we feel that much might  be said. In the striving after compliance with the   apparently weightier matters of the law, there is  a possibility that the importance of this spirit of   love and kindness and charity may be under-  estimated. For ourselves, we cannot think of   any precept that at present requires more  earnest inculcation.    During the past eighteen months there has  been a division of the Latter-day Saints upon  national party lines. Political campaigns have  been conducted, elections have been held, and   feelings, more or less intense, have been en-  gendered in the minds of brethren and sisters   upon one side and the other.    We have been cognizant of conduct and have  heard of many expressions that have been very  painful to us and have grieved our spirits.    We know they have been an offense unto the  God of peace and love, and a stumbling block  unto many of the Saints.    We feel now that a time for reconciliation has   come; that before entering into the Temple to  present ourselves before the Lord in solemn   assembly, we shall divest ourselves of every  harsh and unkind feeling against each other;   that not only our bickerings shall cease, but that  the cause of them shall be removed, and every   sentiment that prompted and has maintained  them shall be dispelled; that we shall confess   our sins one to another, and ask forgiveness one   of another; that we shall plead with the Lord   for the spirit of repentance, and, having obtained  it, follow its promptings; so that in humbling  ourselves before Him and seeking forgiveness   from each other, we shall yield that charity and   generosity to those who crave our forgiveness   that we ask for and expect from heaven. 
 NORMAL INSTRUCTION.    To Y.M.M.I. Stake Superintendents:    DEAR BRETHREN: The importance of   related, systematic, progressive work in  the Mutual Improvement Associations,  as well as other organizations among us  as a people, cannot be over-estimated.  In our letter of September 1st, 1891, to  you we introduced the M.I. Manual,  Part I. It is gratifying to know that the   Manual is proving a practical aid as was   intended. Now the next step in advance  is the preparation of efficient leaders to  conduct this educational work in the   various wards; and to accomplish this the  MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT NORMAL COURSE  OF INSTRUCTION has, upon our recom-  mendation and with our endorsement,   been established in the Brigham Young   Academy, Provo, where representative  young men and young women can be  sent from the various stakes and wards  to receive a course of teaching and train-  ing that will prepare them to properly  conduct the association work in their   wards on a truly educational plan, of   which theology is the base.    You will, therefore, please confer at   once with the Presidency of your Stake,  and with their advice and counsel, in-  struct the president of each association  to confer with his Bishop, by whose ad-  vice and counsel the selection of students   will be made to fill this mission.    The Course of Instruction is five weeks,  and the tuition is free. The first class of  seventy-five students completed its   course or work an the 5th inst., and the  second class is now in session.    Your selection should be made care-  fully and as soon as practicable. The  names of those called to this mission  must be forwarded direct to Assistant  General Superintendent, Milton H.   Hardy, who has been assigned to the  Chair of M.I. NORMAL INSTRUCTION.   He will list and classify the names, and  notify you when they can enter, as the   number in each class will be limited.    Each student selected should receive a   writing to that effect, signed by the  bishop of the ward and the president of  the association.    Praying the spirit of your calling to be  with your constantly,    We remain,    Your fellow-laborers,    Wilford Woodruff,  Jos. F. Smith,   Moses Thatcher,    General Superintendency. 
 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,  April 27th, 1892.    Elders Willard Young and Thomas Hull,  City:    DEAR BRETHREN: We acknowledge  receipt of the report of your labors as  missionaries to the Y.M.M.I. Associa-  tions of Davis, Weber, and Box Elder  Stakes, which was read to us to day. We   are pleased with its spirit and tone, and  note with pleasure the interest taken by  you in the performance of this mission,  from which you will consider yourselves  honorably released. The suggestions  you offer in regard to the importance of  placing under proper control the amuse  ments of our young people, such as   theatrical entertainments, dancing parties,  and social gatherings of every kind are  fully appreciated, and we hope that steps  will be taken to carry them into practical  operation. We sensibly feel that there  is no greater field of labor connected with  the work of God upon the earth to-day  than that of seeking to uplift our young  people morally and spiritually, and to  throw around them safeguards against  the prevailing evils of the world.    Praying the Lord to bless you, and  make you efficient laborers in the work  of building up His Zion, we remain, with  kindest regards,    Your brethren,    Wilford Woodruff,  Joseph F. Smith. 
 chastity of our daughters and sisters.  God has placed upon us that require-  ment. It is not for you to lead them  into dangerous paths; it is not for  you to leave them to be despoiled;   it is your duty, and you are under  obligations to preserve them free and  virtuous, pure and holy. Any na-  tion or people permitting the foun-  tains of life to become contaminated,  will die, as did Greece and Rome.   If we can keep the fountains of life   pure, individuals may fall, but so  long as the body politic is sound,   there is hope for the future. Amen.    Superintendent B. S. Hinckley of   the Utah Stake said he sensed the  importance of his position in stand-  ing before the Conference. It is an   auspicious occasion. Gathered to-  gether are the representatives of the  Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Associations of Zion. It seems to  me we have been born under most  auspicious circumstances—circum-  stances designed to mature the  greatest and purest people on earth.   How many there are who lay every-  thing upon the altar, and put forth  their best efforts for our benefit! Do   what they may for us our salvation  depends upon personal effort.    We have in Utah Stake a good   organization, but I am a new worker  and do not take any credit to myself.   While ours is the banner Stake of  Zion, we have but forty-five percent  of the elligible members in our  associations.    Choir sang the hymn, "Though in  the outward church below."    Benediction by Elder W. H.   Pettigrew.    SUNDAY, 2 P.M.    After invocation President Wil-  ford Woodruff spoke as follows:    Being a member of the Presidency   of the Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions, as well as one of the First   Presidency of the Church, I feel it   not only my privilege but my duty   to address this assembly as a society   of young men and maidens, the ris-  ing generation of this community of   people known by the world at large   as Mormons.    The President of the Church has   been referred to as the head of this  organization. The Lord in almost   every age of the world has chosen   weak and unlettered men to bear the   Priesthood, and He has chosen   whomsoever He would in this day   and time; and the only marvel I have   is that He should have chosen so   weak an instrument as I am to be the   President of this, His Church. But   that is the business of the Lord and   not mine. Occupying the position   that I do, and having passed my   eighty-eighth year in the flesh, and   living upon borrowed time, so to   speak, I can have no reason to ex-  pect that I shall dwell a great while   in your midst. Therefore I feel in   duty bound to give some counsel to  the young men of Israel who are   present today.    There has never been a genera-  tion of the sons of God upon this   earth, from Father Adam down to   this present hour, upon whose   shoulders rested greater responsibility   than rests upon the young men and   maidens of Israel today; and if they   were able to appreciate what their   Creator requires at their hands and   the responsibility resting upon them,   it would not be said in this stand, as   it has been said here today, that one-  half of the young men of certain   wards were not connected with the   Mutual Improvement Associations.    I feel very much gratified with the   results of the labors of those who   have worked and do work in the   cause of mutual improvement, also   those of our sisters who are connect-  ed with the Primary Associations.    Many of our aged sisters at first   took hold of this work, and called   the little children together, and   taught them things of God, as their   minds were able to comprehend   them. Among them was Sister   Eliza R. Snow, who labored in this 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.  JUNIUS F. WELLS,  EDITOR.    Salt Lake City, February, 1892    AMNESTY.    THE following petition for amnesty has  been presented to the President of the   United States:    SALT LAKE, Dec. 19, 1891.    "We, the First Presidency and Apostles  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, beg respectfully to represent  to your Excellency the following facts:    "We formerly taught to our people  that polygamy, or celestial marriage, as  commanded by God through Joseph  Smith, was right; that it was a necessity  to man's highest exaltation in the life to   come.    "That doctrine was publicly promul-  gated by our President, the late Brigham  Young, forty years ago, and was steadily  taught and impressed upon the Latter-  day Saints up to a short time before Sep-  tember, 1890. Our people are devout  and sincere, and they accepted the doc-  trine, and many personally embraced and  practiced polygamy.    "When the Government sought to   stamp the practice out, our people, al-  most without exception, remained firm,  for they, while having no desire to oppose  the Government in anything, still felt that   their lives and their honor as men were  pledged to a vindication of their faith;  and that their duty towards those whose  lives were a part of their own was a par-  amount one, to fulfill which they had no  right to count anything, not even their  own lives, as standing in the way. Fol-  lowing this conviction hundreds endured  arrest, trial, fine and imprisonment, and   the immeasurable suffering borne by the   faithful people, no language can describe.  That suffering, in abated form, still con-  tinues.    "More, the Government added dis-  franchisement to its other punishments  for those who clung to their faith and   fulfilled its covenants.    "According to our faith the head of our   Church receives, from time to time,  revelations for the religious guidance of  his people.    "In September, 1890, the present head  of the Church, in anguish and prayer,  cried to God for help for his flock, and   received permission to advise the mem-  bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints, that the law command-  ing polygamy was henceforth suspended.    "At the great semi-annual conference  which was held a few days later, this was  submitted to the people, numbering  many thousands and representing every  community of the people in Utah, and  was by them in the most solemn  manner accepted as the future rule of  their lives.    "They have since been faithful to the   covenant made that day.    "At the late October conference, after  a year had passed by, the matter was  once more submitted to the thousands of  people gathered together, and they again  in the most potential manner, ratified the   solemn covenant.    "This being the true situation and   believing that the object of the govern-  ment was simply the vindication of its  own authority and to compel obedience  to its laws, and that it takes no pleasure  in persecution, we respectfully pray  that full amnesty may be extended to all  who are under disabilities because of the  operation of the so-called Edmunds and   Edmunds-Tucker laws. Our people are  scattered; homes are made desolate;  many are still imprisoned; others are  banished or in hiding. Our hearts bleed  for those. In the past they followed our  counsels, and while they are thus afflicted  our souls are in sackcloth and ashes.    "We believe there are nowhere in the   Union a more loyal people than the  Latter-day Saints. They know no other  country except this. They expect to  live and die on this soil.    "When the men of the South, who  were in rebellion against the government,  in 1865, threw down their arms and   asked for recognition along the old lines  of citizenship, the Government hastened  to grant their prayer. 
 Thus may we come up into the holy place  with our hearts free from guile and our souls   prepared for the edification that is promised!    Thus shall our supplications, undisturbed by a  thought of discord, unitedly mount into the ears  of Jehovah and draw down the choice blessings  of the God of Heaven!    As your brethren, sustained by your vote   and in your faith as the First Presidency of the   Church, we have this to say to the Latter-day  Saints, in our individual as well as our official  capacity: If there is a single member of the  Church who has feelings against us, we do not  wish to cross the threshold of the Temple until   we have satisfied him and have removed from  him all cause of feeling, either by explanation   or by making proper amends and atonement;   neither would we wish to enter the sacred por-  tals of that edifice until we have sought an ex-  planation, or amends, or atonement, from any  against whom we may have either a real or   fancied grievance.    In now announcing this course for ourselves,   we say to all the other officers of the Church   that we desire them to follow our example. We   wish them from the highest to the lowest and  throughout all the Stakes and Wards of Zion to  take heed of this counsel. Let them invite all  who may have feelings against them to come  forward and make them known; let them then  endeavor to correct any misapprehensions or  misunderstandings which may exist, or give re-  dress for any wrong or inury that may have  been done.    We say the same—and when the officers have   taken the course indicated we wish them to say  the same—to the individual members of the  Church. We call upon them to seek to have the   fellowship of their brethren and their sisters, and   their entire confidence and love; above all to seek  to have the fellowship and union of the Holy   Ghost. Let this spirit be sought and cherished  as diligently within the smallest and humblest   family circle, as within the membership of the  highest organization and quorum. Let it per-  meate the hearts of the brothers and sisters, the  parents and children of the household, as well  as the hearts of the First Presidency and Twelve.   Let it mellow and soften all differences be-  tween members of the Stake Presidencies and  the High Councils as well as between neighbors   living in the same ward. Let it unite young   and old, male and female, flock and shepherd,  people and Priesthood, in the bonds of gratitude  and forgiveness and love, so that Israel may feel  approved of the Lord, and that we may all come  before Him with a conscience void of offense   before all men. Then there will be no disap-  pointment as to the blessings promised those  who sincerely worship Him. The sweet whis-  perings of the Holy Spirit will be given to them  and the treasures of heaven, the communion   of angels, will be added from time to time, for  His promise has gone forth and it cannot fail!    Asking God's blessing upon you in your  endeavor to carry out this counsel, and desirous  of seeing it take the form of a united effort on  the part of the whole people, we suggest that   Saturday, March 25th, 1893, be set apart as a  day of fasting and prayer. On that occasion   we advise that the Presidencies of Stakes, the   High Councils, the Bishops and their Counsel-  ors, meet together with the Saints in their  several meeting houses, confess their sins one  to another, and draw out from the people all   feelings of anger, of distrust, or of unfriendliness  that may have found a lodgment; so that entire   confidence may then and there be restored and   love from this time prevail through all the con-  gregations of the Saints.

 cause faithfully during the latter part   of her life. The Sunday Schools,   too, are a very important institution   in our Church. President Young   was moved upon in very early days   to organize the Sabbath Schools in   these valleys. Many have labored   faithfully to carry on the work, and   others have taken hold of it, until we   have today, I understand, almost a   hundred thousand children belonging   to the Sabbath Schools. They are   taught the Gospel of Christ. They  are taught the duties of children to   parents; the importance of their es-  chewing evil and ceasing from sin,   and praying to God to keep them in   the paths of virtue, holiness, right-  eousness and truth.    Then the young men and maidens   of Zion have been organized into   what has been termed Mutual Im-  provement Associations. Too much   importance cannot be attached to   any of these organizations and their   interests. We look to the Mutual   Improvement Associations for our   Elders, for our missionaries. We go  to this body of young people, and   take from them men to go into the   vineyard of the Lord to preach the   Gospel of Jesus Christ. Do our   young men comprehend this? I fear   not, but many of them do, and many   of them have entered upon this work.    And such are prepared from child-  hood to pray and obtain the Spirit  and power of God, the Holy Ghost,   the revelations of heaven, enabling   them to go forth, bearing the holy   Priesthood to warn the world, con-  vert the honest in heart and gather   them to Zion to prepare them for   the coming of the Son of Man. Up-  on your shoulders, young men of   Israel, rests this duty today. Your  fathers are passing away. Joseph   Smith laid the foundation of this   Church. He lived but a short time.    Like the Savior he died a martyr.    He lived but a little longer than the   Savior did. Jesus labored only three   years and a half after entering upon   the active duties of the ministry. Jos-  eph labored in his mission some   fourteen years, I believe. He stood   at the head of this dispensation.    His spirit was kept in the   spirit world to tabernacle in the  flesh in fulfillment of promises to   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and   Ephraim. Through their posterity   he came forth and laid the founda-  tion of this Church, and organized it   in all its beauty and power and glory   and strength and Priesthood, by the   authority of God. I do not know   how many there are in this house   who knew him, but there are some   who were acquainted with him for   years. Before he was called away   he organized the Church of God with   prophets, apostles, teachers, gifts,   helps and governments, and there   were given unto him, and by him   sealed upon the heads of the Apostles   and Elders of Israel the holy Priest-  hood, the apostleship, the keys of   the kingdom of God; and these Apos-  tles were commanded of God to   round up their shoulders and bear off   this kingdom or they would be   damned. I am now the only man   living in the flesh who was present   when that communication was given   to us. My presence with you must   necessarily be limited. I cannot   stay a great while longer, and don't   expect to; but I know it is my   duty to do what I can in laying be-  fore the rising generation their duties.    I am especially anxious that our   young people should sense the great   responsibility that must sooner or   later rest upon them; and that they   should bear in mind the fact that   they were kept in the spirit world   thousands of years to come through   the loins of the ancient patriarchs   and prophets in our own age and   generation for the very purpose of  carrying on this great latter-day   work. God called upon us and He   will call upon you and our posterity   after us, to rise and warn the genera-  tions in which they live; to preach   the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the   nations of the earth that their gar- 
 "To be at peace with the Government  and in harmony with their fellow citizens  who are not of their faith, and to share in  the confidence of the government and  people, our people have voluntarily put  aside something which all their lives  they have believed to be a sacred princi-  ple.    "Have they not the right to ask for  such clemency as comes when the claims  of both law and justice have been fully  liquidated?

 ments may be free of the blood of all   men, when the judgments of God   overtake the wicked, as they will,   and as they have overtaken the   wicked in generations that are past   and gone. Who else, I ask, does   the God of Israel, do the heavenly   hosts, look to to carry on this great   and mighty work, but to you who   are the sons and daughters of the   men to whom He has revealed Him-  self; you who, too, have entered   into sacred covenants with Him; you   who are the descendants of the noble   men of old to whom God made great   and glorious promises? And if you   do not do your duty in these things,   you will certainly come under con-  demnation.    Let me refer you to the testimony   of Enoch as given to us in the Pearl   of Great Price. Speaking of the   disobedient who rejected the Gospel   taught by Noah, Enoch says that  "the God of heaven looked upon the   residue of the people and wept;" and  Enoch bore record of it saying,   "How is it that the heavens weep,   and shed forth their tears as the rain   upon the mountains?" . . . The   Lord said unto Enoch, "Behold   these thy brethren; they are the   workmanship of mine own hands,   and I gave unto them their know-  ledge in the day that I created them;  and in the Garden of Eden gave I   unto man his agency; and unto thy   brethren have I said, and also gave   commandments that they should love   one another and that they should   choose me their Father; but behold,   they are without affection; and they   hate their own blood; and the fire of   mine indignation is kindled against   them, . . . and among all the   workmanship of my hands there has   not been so great wickedness as   among thy brethren; but behold,  their sins shall be upon the heads of   their fathers; Satan shall be their  father; and misery shall be their   doom; and the whole heavens shall   weep over them." [##Moses 7:28-41##]    You are today occupying the same   position before heaven and before the  earth, before God, angels, and men,   you young men of Israel. Now can   you afford to turn away from the   commandments of God and allow   satan to rule over you and be your   father? Can you afford not to quali-  fy yourselves for the great work that   lies before you? You cannot. I   am sorry to think that any of our   young men should be found careless   and indifferent to the responsibility  imposed upon them by the reason of   their lineage and the covenants they   are under. I would to God the eyes   of our sons were open, all of them,   so they could see themselves as God   and our worthy progenitors behold   us. I would to God you could all   realize what is expected of you. I   call upon parents throughout Zion   to do what you can to induce your   sons and daughters to walk in the   paths of righteousness and truth and   to improve the opportunities before   them. Do not let your hearts be   altogether upon the vanity and af-  fairs of the world, but learn to ap-  preciate the fact that faithful children   are among the choicest and greatest   of blessings.    I used to meet with, instruct and   bless the young Elders that were set  apart from time to time to go on   missions; I have made that a part of   my business. I have now arrived at   an age when I am obliged to leave   off some duties I formerly performed,   and that is one of them. As I can-  not now be present with young mis-  sionaries when they are set apart to   go on missions, I want to say it here,   so that when that call is made upon   you, you will remember it when I am   past and gone. There are two or   three things that I want you to re-  member, you that go upon missions,   and all faithful Elders will be called   on missions, for the harvest is great   and the laborers are few compared with   the necessity there is for such work   in the four quarters of the earth to-  day, to warn the world and preach   the Gospel. One thing is, when you 
 go into a neighborhood to preach  the Gospel, never attempt to tear   down a man's house, so to speak,   before you build him a better one;   never, in fact attack any one's re-  ligion, wherever you go. Be willing   to let every man enjoy his own re-  ligion. It is his right to do that.    If he does not accept your testimony   with regard to the Gospel of Christ,   that is his affair, and not yours. Do   not spend your time in pulling down   other sects and parties. We haven't   time to do that. It is never right to   do that. When I have been abroad   preaching I have found that people   who were prepared to receive my  testimony believed in me, and in like   manner they will receive the test-  imony you have to give to them, if   they can be touched with the Spirit   of God. This is exemplified in the   preaching of the Savior, which drew   forth from Him this remark: "No man   can come to me, except the Father,   which hath sent me, draw him."    Another thing is: Wherever we   go, sustain any and every govern-  ment under heaven that sustains you.    Sustain all governments. Never be   found antagonizing any government.    Government belongs to the people,   and if it is not good for them, it is   their business to rectify it, not yours.    I got into a position once that   brought this to my mind very   strongly; it occurred in my labors in   the south of England. On my first   mission to that country I went with   Brother Kimball and Brother George   A. Smith to London, and helped to  build up the first branch of the   Church that was organized there.    After returning home, I was again   sent to England by President Young   with Elder John Taylor and other   brethren. It was customary for us   to hold out-door meetings, as they   are called; and while doing so, on one   occasion, at London, one of our  brethren referred to the English   government in terms anything but  complimentary to the people to whom   it belonged, which, of course, was  contrary to the spirit of our calling   and mission. It was brought to the  attention of one of the chiefs of   police, who came to me about it.    The same Elder had an appointment   for the next Sabbath on the same   ground. But before filling it I was   careful to see that he was shown the   unwisdom of pursuing such a course,   also to see that wiser and more con-  servative men did the preaching on   that occasion. Had he been per-  mitted to continue to indulge in such   talk we would have brought  upon   ourselves persecution, but by taking   a wise and proper course, we received   the protection of the police and govern-  ment, and at last got permission to   preach in churches, and were enabled  to baptize thousands of church mem-  bers; and we had as much freedom   as we had in our own country. We   learned afterwards that at this second   meeting were two or three policemen   in disguise who made a most favor-  able report to the chief of police   about us. Wherever we go we must   always sustain the government that   gives us protection. I wanted to   mention and impress upon our young   Elders these two things. It might   not be out of place for me to say that   we baptized the policeman that   approached me, and he proved him-  self to be a true and faithful Latter-  day Saint.    Now, I want to say to the Elders   of Israel, young and old, there is  nothing that we ought to labor more   to obtain while in the flesh than the  Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, the   Comforter, which we are entitled to   receive by reason of our having   obeyed the requirements of the Gos-  pel. When you get acquainted with   the Spirit, follow its dictates, no mat-  ter where it may lead you; and when   you do that, it will become a princi-  ple of revelation in you. I have al-  ways found that a true principle in   my whole life. If I had not followed   that Spirit in my life, I would not be   with you today. President Young   told me, the first year of the settle- 
 ment of these valleys, to go to Bos-  ton, and gather out all the Saints I   could from the Middle Atlantic and   New England States and the Canadas,   who had been left there, and bring   them up to Zion. I carried out his   instructions to the best of my ability,   and whenever I could get a company   of a hundred men I would select   some man and put him to preside   over them, and send them on. I   was the means of thus gathering to  Zion hundreds of people. I, myself,   took the lead of the last company.    When we arrived at Pittsburg, just   as we landed I was anxious to take a   steamer and go on to St. Louis. I   sought an interview with the captain   just as he was starting out with some   two hundred and twenty passengers   on board. He expressed himself   willing to take us on board, and I   thought I would go; but just then   the Spirit of the Lord came upon me,   and said, "Don't go on board that   steamer." That was enough. I   knew the voice of the Spirit. I ex-  cused myself to the captain and   turned away. He immediately start-  ed down the river. It was a dark   night. Five miles below Pittsburg   the steamer took fire. They had no   chains on board, and there was   hardly a soul on board that escaped  death either from fire or water. There   were with me in that company Leon-  ard W. Hardy, Samuel Hardy and   the Atwoods, who during their life-  time were widely known. By hark-  ening to the "still small voice" my   company was saved, and I am spared   to tell you about it today. I know   by experience the value of it. You  young men should live in such a   manner as to be entitled to the oper-  ations of the Holy Ghost within you,   and, as I have said, it will become a   guide as well as a revelator to you,   and never leave or fail you.    I felt to say these few words to our   young men of Israel. Zion is going  to be the glory of the whole earth,   and all the purposes of God that you   read of in the Bible and in the Book   of Mormon in regard to the designs   of God in the last days are going to   be fulfilled to the very letter. And,   as I said before, I say again, your   future blessings, your future exalta-  tion and glory, worlds without end,   will depend upon the course you pur-  sue here. The way is clear before   you that leads to life eternal. It was   found out by men whose voices are   now hushed in death, and we have   shown it to you; and it now remains   for you to walk therein.    Now, I would say to our superin-  tendents here, continue your labor   with the youth of Zion. Be not   weary in your efforts to save the   souls of men, for this is the work of   your Heavenly Father. The boys   whom you teach are the instruments   whom the God of Heaven has called   to bear off His Kingdom, and they   will do it: yes, I repeat, they will do   it; it is the will of God they should,   and it is a pleasure for me to bear   my testimony of these things to you   at the age I have attained to.    I want to say a word to our young   sisters. When you receive an offer   of marriage, find out whether the   young man smokes, or drinks, or   swears, or whether he goes to the   Sabbath School, or Mutual Improve-  ment Association, whether he is vir-  tuous and worthy to bear the Priest-  hood of the Son of God. A young   woman had better be single all her   days than to marry a man who dis-  honors God and his parents, and is   unworthy of the blessings which he   is entitled to receive through the   Gospel of Christ. You boys and   girls have a great future before you.    There lies within your reach salva-  tion, eternal life and a part in the   first resurrection; in fact, all the bless-  ings God has promised to any peo-  ple that has ever been in the flesh, are   held out to you and are within your   reach inasmuch as you do your duty   in these things.    Before taking my seat, I want to   ask the young men to study the  scriptures; and to learn to understand 
 the signs of the times in which you  live. The signs of the second com-  ing of the son of God are every-  where seen, but the world does   not comprehend them. The devil   is abroad in the earth, and he will   destroy every person that he can.    Search the scriptures that have come   directly to us, as well as those con-  tained in the Bible, and learn to  comprehend the mind and will of   God, which we can do by reading   them when the light of the Holy   Spirit is within us, and thus prepare   yourselves for that which will   come to pass in life. My desire and   my prayer for you and the youth of   Zion is that you may rise up and   magnify your calling and do your  duty, and accomplish all that God   requires of you; which may God   grant for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 DISCOURSE  BY  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,    At the General Conference, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Saturday, a.m., October 8th, 1881.    REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    I want to preach a short sermon  to this congregation. To begin with,  I have heard President Young and  President Taylor a great many times  from this stand ask the people to  keep quiet until the meeting was  dismissed; but as soon as the ser-  mon ends there are a hundred boys  and girls, or two hundred of them,  rush for the doors. I do not like it.  It pains me to see the President of  the Church make this request and  the people pay no attention to it.    Now, in this fast age we are pass-  ing from a polite age to a very rude  one in many respects. When I was  a boy 65 years ago and went to  school, I never thought of passing a  man whom I knew in the street, or  a woman, without taking off my  hat and making a bow. I never  thought of saying "yes" or "no" to  those that were placed over me. I   was taught to say "yes, sir" and  "no, sir;" but to-day it is "yes" and  "no," "I will," "I won't," "I shall"  and "I shan't." Now, when I see  this rudeness amongst us, I some-  times wish that the spirit of  the New England fathers  was more among the people,  but I do hope, brethren, sisters and  friends, when a man stops talking  and the choir rises to sing, that you  will keep your seats. You can af-  ford to do this as well as the Presi-  dent of the Church, the Twelve  Apostles, or others who are sitting   on this stand. You don't see us  jump up and run for the door the   moment a speaker is done. The  Lord is displeased with any such  thing. I hope you will pardon me  for so speaking. I felt to say that   much.    We have a variety of teach-  ing and preaching, and I have  sometimes thought that we have  more preaching and teaching than  any other people on the earth. I   expect it is all right. I think we   need it.  The world need teaching,   we ourselves need teaching; but I   have thought that the Latter-day  Saints have had more of the Gospel  of Christ proclaimed to them than  any other generation that ever lived.    My mind reverts to the channels  of communication from God to man.  Here we have the Bible which gives  a history and prophecy of the pro-  phets from Adam down to our own  day extending through a period of   near 6,000 years. The Lord, through  all the destruction that has taken   place in the various libraries of the   world—like the great library of Al-  exandria, for example—has preserv-  ed the record of the Jews, at least   we have a portion of it to read.   Then, again, we have the Book of   Mormon, the stick of Joseph in the  hands of Ephraim, giving a history   of the ancient inhabitants of this   country from the time of their leav-  ing the Tower of Babel to their dis-  appearance from the land, and of the  visitation of Christ to them. We   have these books from which to ob-  tain knowledge. Then we have the   Book of Doctrine and Covenants, our   Testament, which contains the most   glorious, godlike, solemn and eter-  nal truths ever recorded within the  lids of a book on the earth. All these  records are the words of God to   man; and though the heavens and   earth pass away not one jot or title   will ever fall unfulfilled.    Then the Lord has other ways of   communicating His mind and will.   We have the living oracles with us,  and have had from the day that   Joseph Smith received the ministra-  tions of Moroni, the Nephite, John   the Baptist, Peter, James and John,   Moses, Elias, Elijah, Jesus Christ—  from that day we have had the liv-  ing oracles to teach us the word of  the Lord.    President Joseph F. Smith yester-  day spoke of the gifts and graces.  Now, the Lord has many ways in   which He communicates with us.   Freq[u]ently, as has been the case in  every age, truths, principles, warn-  ings, etc., are communicat-  ed to the children of men   by means of dreams and visions.  There is a great vision recorded in   the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.   When Sidney Rigdon and Joseph   Smith saw the visions of heaven   they were commanded to write   while in the vision. The Lord was   in that. It is a communication to   man. But we have had a great   many dreams—I have had in my  life, and I suppose you have more or   less—which amounts to nothing. I   will tell you just about what I re-  fer to. A man eats a hot supper   and goes to bed; he gets the night-  mare; he is chased by a bear; or he  falls over a precipice, and as soon as  he strikes the ground he wakes up.   Now, the Lord had nothing to do   with that. A man may go to bed   half worried to death, tired and  dream about something that will   never take place. Last night, for  instance, I dreamt I was making  glass houses out of blocks of glass   two feet square. Now, I don't know  that the Lord was in that. Yet I   have had dreams of a very different  character. When I was a boy 11   years old, I had a very interesting   dream, part of which was fulfilled   to the very letter. In this dream I   saw a great gulf, a place where all  the world had to enter at death, be-  fore doing which they had to drop   their worldly goods. I saw an aged  man with a beaver hat and a   broadcloth suit. The man looked  very sorrowful. I saw him come  with something on his back, which  he had to drop among the   general pile before he could enter  the gulf. I was then but a boy. A   few years after this my father   and mother removed to Farmington  and there I saw that man. I knew  him the moment I saw him. His   name was Chauncy Deming. In a  few years afterwards he was taken  sick and died. I attended his funer-  al. He was what you may call a   miser, worth hundreds of thousands   of dollars. When the coffin was  being lowered into the grave my   dream came to me, and that night  his son-in-law found one hundred  thousand dollars in a cellar belong-  ing to the old man. I name this   merely to show that in this dream   I had manifested to me certain   things that were true. I think of   all the inhabitants of the world   having to leave their goods when   they come to the grave. After this   scene had passed before me I was  placed in a great temple. It was   called the kingdom of God. The   first man that came to me was Un-  cle Ozem Woodruff and his wife I   helped into the temple. I assisted a  great many into that temple. In  process of time, after embracing the   Gospel, and while on my first mis-  sion to Tennessee, I told Bro. Pat-  ten of my dream who told me that  in a few years I would meet that   man and baptize him. That was  fulfilled to the very letter, for I af-  terwards baptized my uncle and his  wife and some of the children; also  my own father and step-mother and  step-sister, and a Methodist priest or  class-leader—in fact I baptized every-  body in my father's house. I merely  mention this to show—that dreams   sometimes do come to pass in life.    Then, again, there are   visions. Paul you know, on   one occasion was caught up   to the third heaven and saw  things that were not lawful to utter.  He did not know whether he was  In the body or out of the body. That   was a vision. When Joseph Smith,  however, was visited by Moroni and   the Apostles, it was not particularly   a vision that he had; he talked with  them face to face.    Now, I will refer to a thing that   took place with me in Tennessee. I   was in Tennessee in the year 1835,   and while at the house of Abraham   O. Smoot I received a letter from  Brothers Joseph Smith and Oliver   Cowdery, requesting me to stay  there and stating that I would lose  no blessing by doing so. Of course,   I was satisfied. I went into a little  room and sat down upon a small   sofa. I was all my myself and the  room was dark; and while I rejoiced  in this letter and the promise made   to me, I became wrapped in vision.  I was like Paul; I did not know  whether I was in the body or out of  the body. A personage appeared   to me and showed me the great  scenes that should take place in the  last days. One scene after another   passed before me. I saw the sun   darkened; I saw the moon become   as blood; I saw the stars fall from   heaven; I saw seven golden lamps   set in the heavens, representing the  various dispensations of God to man  —a sign that would appear before   the coming of Christ. I saw the re-  surrection of the dead. In the first  resurrection those that came forth  from their graves seemed to be all   dressed alike, but in the second  resurrection they were as di-  verse in their dress as this congrega-  tion is before me to-day, and if I   had been an artist I could have   painted the whole scene as it was  impressed upon my mind, more in-  delibly fixed than any thing I had   ever seen with the natural eye.   What does this mean? It was a   testimony of the resurrection of the   dead. I had a testimony. I believe  in the resurrection of the dead, and   I know it is a true principle. Thus   we may have dreams about things  of great importance, and dreams of   no importance at all. The Lord   warned Joseph in a dream to take  the young child Jesus and His   mother into Egypt, and thus He  was saved from the wrath of Herod.   Hence there are a great many things   taught us in dreams that are true,  and if a man has the spirit of God   he can tell the difference between   what is from the Lord and what is   not. And I want to say to my  brethren and sisters, that whenever   you have a dream that you feel is   from the Lord, pay attention to it.   When I was in the City of London   on one occasion, with Brother George  A. Smith, I dreamt that my wife   came to me and told me that our  first child had died. I believed my  dream, and in the morning while  at breakfast, I felt somewhat sad.  Brother George A. noticed this and   I told him my dream. Next morn-  ing's post brought me a letter from   my wife, conveying the intelligence   of the death of my child. It may   be asked what use there was in   such a thing. I don't know that  there was much use in it except to  prepare my mind for the news of   the death of my child. But what I   wanted to say in regard to these   matters is that the Lord does  communicate some things of im-  portance to the children of men by  means of visions and dreams as well  as by the records of divine truth.  And what is it all for? It is to teach  us a principle. We may never see   anything take place exactly as we  see it in a dream or a vision, yet is is  intended to teach us a principle.   My dream gave me a strong testi-  mony of the resurrection. I am   satisfied, always have been, in re-  gard to the resurrection. I rejoice  in it. The way was opened unto us  by the blood of the Son of God.    Now, having said so much on that   subject,  I want to say to my breth-  ren and sisters that we are placed  upon the earth to build up Zion, to  build up the kingdom of God. The  greater proportion of the male mem-  bers of Zion, who have arrived at   the years of early manhood, bear   some portion of the Holy Priest-  hood. Here is a kingdom of Priests  raised up by the power of God to   take hold and build up the kingdom   of God. The same Priesthood exists  on the other side of the vail. Every   man who is faithful in his quorum  here will join his quorum there.  When a man dies and his body is  laid in the tomb, he does not lose  his position. The Prophet  Joseph Smith held the keys of   this dispensation on this side  of the vail, and he will hold them   throughout the countless ages of  eternity. He went into the spirit   world to unlock the prison doors and   to preach the gospel to the millions   of spirits who are in darkness, and   every Apostle, every Seventy, every  Elder, etc., that has died in the  faith as soon as he passes to the   other side of the vail, enters into  the work of the ministry, and there  is a thousand times more to preach  there than there is here. I have  felt of late as if our brethren on the  other side of the vail had held a   council, and that they had said to   this one, and that one, "Cease thy  work on earth, come hence, we need   help," and they have called this   man and that man. It has appeared   so to me in seeing the many men  that have been called from our  midst lately. Perhaps I may be   permitted to relate the circumstance  with which I am acquainted in re-  gard to Bishop Roskelley, of Smith-  field, Cache Valley. On one occa-  sion he was suddenly taken very  sick—near to death's door. While  he lay in this condition, President  Peter Maughan, who was dead,  came to him and said: "Brother   Roskelley, we held a council on the   other side of the vail. I have had   a great deal to do, and I have the  privilege of coming here to appoint   one man to come and help. I have   had three names given to me in   council, and you are one of them. I  want to inquire into your circum-  stances." The Bishop told him   what he had to do, and they con-  versed together as one man would  converse with another. President  Maughan then said to him: "I think  I will not call you. I think you are  wanted here more than perhaps   one of the others." Bishop Roskel-  ly got well from that hour. Very  soon after, the second man was  taken sick, but not being able to ex-  ercise sufficient faith, Brother Ros-  kelley did not go to him. By and by   this man recovered, and on meeting   Brother Roskelley he said: "Brother  Maughan came to me the other   night and told me he was sent to  call one man from the ward," and   he named two men as had been   done to Brother Roskelley. A few   days afterwards the third man was  taken sick and died. Now, I name   this to show a principle. They have  work on the other side of the vail;   and they want men, and they call   them. And that was my view in   regard to Brother George A. Smith.   When he was almost a[t] death's door   Brother Cannon administered to  him and in thirty minutes he was up  and ate breakfast with his family.   We labored with him in this way,   but ultimately, as you know, he   died. But it taught me a lesson. I   felt that man was wanted behind  the vail. We labored also with Bro-  ther Pratt; he, too, was wanted be-  hind the vail.    Now, my brethren and sisters,  those of us who are left here have a  great work to do. We have been   raised up of the Lord to take this  kingdom and bear it off. This is our   duty; but if we neglect our duty and  set our hearts upon the things of  this world, we will be sorry for it.  We ought to understand the respon-  sibility that rests upon us. We   should gird up our loins and put on  the whole armor of God. We should  rear temples to the name of the   Most High God, that we may redeem   the dead.    I feel to bear my testimony to this  work. It is the work of God.  Jo-  seph Smith was appointed by the  the Lord before he was born as   much as Jeremiah was. The Lord  told Jeremiah—"Before I formed  thee in the belly I knew thee; and  before thou camest forth out of the  womb I sanctified thee, and I or-  dained thee a Prophet unto the na-  tions." He was commanded to  warn the inhabitants of Jerusalem   of their wickedness. He felt it a  hard task, but ultimately he did as  he was commanded. So I say with   regard to Joseph Smith. He receiv-  ed his appointment from before the   foundation of the world, and he   came forth in the due time of the  Lord to establish this work on the   earth. And so it is the case with  tens of thousands of the Elders of   Israel. The Lord Almighty has  conferred upon you the Holy Priest-  hood and made you the instrument   in His hands to build up this king-  dom, Do we contemplate these   things as fully as we ought? Do  we realize that the eyes of all the   heavely hosts are over us? Then   let us do our duty. Let us keep the  commandments of God, let us be  faithful to the end, so that when we  go into the spirit world and look  back upon our history we may be   satisfied.  The Lord Almighty has  set his hand to establish   His kingdom never more to be   thrown down or given to another   people, and, therefore, all the pow-  ers of earth and hell combined will   never be able to stay the progress of   this work. The Lord has said he   will break in pieces every weapon   that is raised against Zion, and the  nations of the earth, the Kings and   Emperors, Presidents and Gover-  nors have got to learn this fact. It   is a fearful thing to fall into the  hands of the Lord. It is a fearful   thing to shed the blood of the Lord's   anointed. It has cost the Jews 1800   years of persecution, and this gene-  ration have also a bill to pay in this   respect.    I bear my testimony to these  things. The Bible, the Book of   Mormon, the Book of Doctrine and   Covenants contain the words of   eternal life unto this generation, and   they will rise in judgment against  those who reject them.    May God bless this people and  help us to magnify our callings, for   Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.    We have lying before us the earth-  ly tabernacle of President Brigham   Young. His voice is hushed in   death, and all Israel has to bow and   submit to the mind and will of God.   Israel will never again hear his   voice until after the resurrection. I   have no desire to occupy the time   of this assembly, in eulogizing the   life of President Young. His   works and words are recorded in   heaven, and they are recorded here   on the earth; and that is sufficient.   Let those of us who remain a few   days study the counsels, the ser-  mons and principles which have   been revealed unto us through the   mouth of this prophet of God. It   will be but a few days until a great   many of us who are in this assemb-  ly will follow him.    It seems as though Joseph was   with anxious to have him, on the   other side of the vail, almost all the   men that labored with him and   stood shoulder to shoulder with him   in the flesh. I do no suppose there   was ever a man breathed the breath   of life who, in the short space of   forty-five years, has done so much  towards the establishment of the  government and kingdom of God,   as our beloved President. His life   has been before many of you for   several years, and to some from the   commencement of his labors in this   church. He felt the weight of this   dispensation resting upon him; he   certainly has been true and faithful   unto death, and he is prepared to   receive a crown of life.    About all I wish to do in my re-  marks is to exhort this great body  of people who hold the holy priest-  hood, that during the few remain-  ing days of our earthly life we con-  tinue, faithfully, the work that is   now left us to do. "The Lord   has given and the Lord has taken   away, and blessed be the name of   the Lord." The great desire of   President Young in the last year of   his life, as well as previously, was   that before he passed away he  might erect Temples to the name   of the Lord, in that way and man-  ner that men bearing the holy   priesthood in the flesh could enter   into those temples and perform   their missions, for the redemption   of the dead. This has been plainly  manifested to all who have been   much in his company. I rejoice   that he lived long enough to enter  into one Temple and attend to its  dedication, and to commence the   work of others. And I would say   to this people, let us go to and  finish these Temples, that we may   continue the work required of us. I   trust we will realize the import-  ance of the great and serious res-  ponsibilities resting upon us who   are engaged in the work which   comprehends all others; it being the   great and last dispensation of the   fulness of times; that we, like our  leader, may be diligent, day and   night, in striving to carry out the   counsels given to us.    I feel to thank God in my spirit  that our beloved President has had   the privilege, when his work was   finished, of laying down his body   in peace, at home, surrounded by   his family and friends; instead of   suffering martyrdom as did our for-  mer President, and as did nearly   all of the ancient Apostles. This   to me is certainly very consoling.   And I would repeat, Let us accom-  plish the work laid upon us by our   beloved leader, so that when our   time is ended, we can go hence and   be welcomed into the society of   Brigham, of Joseph, George A.,   Brother Kimball and the host of   Elders who have dwelt in the flesh   and proven faithful and true, feel-  ing satisfied with our labors.    It is said that "blessings brighten   as they take their flight." I have   ofter felt in listening to the glorious  principles of President Young, that   the people here heard him so much   that they hardly prized the beauty  and the extent of the results and   virtues of his teachings. Brethren  let us give these things our serious   attention and remember them and   carry them out in our lives. Let   us keep the commandments, striv-  ing in all earnestness to be true   and faithful to the end of our work,  so that we may share the joys of   those men whose names brighten   the pages of our history.    I would say to the bereaved fam-  ily, may God comfort you and bless   you and give you increasedly of   his Spirit. Your husband and fa-  ther has gone to prepare the way   for his family who must sooner   or later follow after him. If you, as   his wives, his sons and daughters   keep his sayings, you will be pre-  pared to meet him in the morning   of the resurrection, numbered   among the faithful and worth   ones. And to my brethren and   sisters who have heard his voice  for these many years: Let us not   forget the precious words of truth  and wisdom he has taught us. We  are living in a time of important   changes. If ever a man could have   been saved from dying through   prayer, President Brigham Young   could. But it was not in the power  of man to keep him here. I believe  Bro. Geo. A. Smith was kept from  dying through the prayers of his   brethren and the saints, several   months after he was called away.   But when the Lord calls we must  go. When we received word in St.   George of the sickness of President  Young, we stopped all business, and  went into the Temple remaining   mostly for two days and nights en-  gaged in supplicating Almight   God for his recovery, until the time  of his death. Having finished his  work he had to go; and he is now  beyond the power of pain and sor-  row, sickness and death. He has   been true and faithful to the end,  and therefore all is well with him.    That God may bless us all, and   help us to realize the responsibility   we are under to him, to our fellow-  man and to each other, to the liv-  ing and to the dead, is my prayer  in the name of Jesus. Amen. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.    O God, our Eternal Father, we  present ourselves before thee, in the  name of Jesus Christ, to say that  we have committed to this tomb  the tabernacle of they servant Pres-  ident Brigham Young, and before  closing our labors and services and  duties towards him, we wish to ded-  icate unto thee this vault, with all  its contents and surroundings. In  the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,  and by authority of the holy priest  hood and apostleship, we dedicate  this ground and this vault with all  the materials of which it is com-  posed, that it may be holy unto the  Lord our God. We dedicate this  coffin, and the box which contains  it, that it may be holy unto the  Lord our God. We also dedicate  the body itself, the tabernacle of  thy servant, unto the Lord our  God, that it may be holy unto thee.  And we pray in the name of Jesus  Christ that this body may sleep  here in peace a few days, until  the time shall come when by the  power of God and the keys of the  resurrection, it shall come forth  clothed with glory, immortality  and eternal lives, with crowns,  kingdoms, principalities and pow-  ers, as they have been and will be  appointed unto him. Yes, our Fa-  ther, this same tabernacle, which  has borne the burden and heat of  the day, which has borne testi-  mony through its life of the estab-  lishment of the kingdom of God,  preached the gospel of Christ and  performed its work faithfully, this  mortal body which has suffered  pain and sickness, persecution and  death, may then arise in glory and  power to attain to its throne, cloth-  ed in glory and immortality, in  connection with Abraham, Isaac  and Jacob and the prophets, and  all the holy men who shall then  judge the inhabitants of the earth,  even those who have lived in his  day and generation, to whom he  has been faithful in bearing testi-  mony of they word and work.    All these things, our Father, we  dedicate to thee and thy safe keep-  ing in the name of Jesus Christ, and  pray that we, with him, may be  prepared in the morning of the  first resurrection, and that we may  be with him in the family organiz-  ation that shall be organized in the  celestial world, and that we may  be prepared to receive those keys  and blessings which have been  promised through the priesthood  and gospel of the Son of God. We  dedicate all pertaining unto this  place, this burial ground and all its  surroundings unto the Lord our  God.    We thank thee, our Father, that  thou has revealed unto us that  power and principle of the resur-  rection by which the pain, the  sting and power of death are all  taken away.  For all these things,  our Father, we praise thee; and  pray that this dedication, in all its  parts, may be acceptable in thy  sight, and that these blessings may  rest down upon the family, the  wives, sons and daughters of thy  servant Brigham, which mercies  and favors we ask, dedicating all  unto thee, in the name of Jesus  Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 
 THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.    COUNCIL.    Council convened Tuesday, Feb.  7th at 2 p. m.    Councilor Woodruff presented  the following report of the Des-  eret Agricultural and Manufactur-  ing Society, for the years 1874 and  1875, which was read, ordered   spread on the minutes and refer-  red to the committee on claims  and appropriations, with instruc-  tions to incorporate in a bill the  amount asked for therein:    To the Honorable Legislative As-  sembly of the Territory of Utah:    Gentlemen: We take pleasure in  representing that the operations of  the Society, for the past two years,  have been chiefly confined to the  improvement and adornment of the  Agricultural Park, which consists   in part of a mile and a half mile  tracks, in fine condition; in build-  ings, suitable for our present wants;   in fencing, bridging, grading, and  adorning the park with trees, etc.  A spring of fresh water from the  16th Ward is now conveyed in red-  wood pipes to the centre of the   grounds, at a cost of $2,500, and an   exacavation has been made for orna-  mental waterwork, preparatory to  the erection of fountains and the  planting of shrubbery, etc.    The grounds have also been en-  closed with a good, substantial  fence; the east side is built of lum-  ber, six feet high, closely fitted   together, which in future in inten-  ded to form a part of stalls, etc., for   the exhibition of stock, products,   agricultural implements, etc.    In making these improvements  the Society has kept in view the  advantages that will, in the future,  be derived by having suitable   grounds and conveniences for the  exhibition of stock and other pro-  ducts of the Territory, and have  taken pains to make it an attractive   place and pleasant resort for citi-  zens.    A stock fair was held on the  grounds in Oct., 1874.  A fine exhi-  bition of blooded and graded stock  was made, showing a marked im-  provement over former exhibitions,   particularly so in the horses, horned   stock and sheep.    Herewith we present the finan-  cial exhibit of the Treasurer, which  shows an indebtedness of $2,401.93.  To enable us to cancel said indebt-  edness and complete improve-  ments already commenced, we  respectfully ask your Honorable  body to appropriate the sum of  $5,000.    Respectfully submitted,  W. WOODRUFF, President.    Financial exhibit of the D. A.  and M. Society, for the two years  ending Dec. 31st, 1875:    RECEIPTS.

 Councilor Woodruff, chairman of  committee on claims and appro-  priations, presented the following  report, which was read:    Gentlement: Your committee on  claims and appropriations, to whom  was referred the claim of Harrison  Edwards for alleged "services in  visiting public prisons," respecttul-  ly report that we find no statute of  the Territory, requiring such ser-  vice or providing for its payment,  and therefore recommend that pe-  titioner have leave to withdraw his  petition. Respectfully,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Chairman.    February 7th, 1876. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that the  things of the world are of little conse-  quence to us without salvation. He   was glad to find so many of the Saints  here whom he had seen in distant  countries beyond the seas. We are  now where we can have peace, worship  the Lord and enjoy ourselves in security.  It requires the Spirit of God to enable  us to properly appreciate our blessings.  Those that have that Spirit can see the  kingdom of God in the latter times.  There is no greater work in which a  man can feel interest than this work in  which we are engaged. We ought to  be rich in the treasures of knowledge  and understanding. The Lord owns  and blesses this people. If a man  wants to look at miracles, he may see them in  the establishment and preservation of  this church. We live in a fast age, and  the Lord is doing a great work in our  day. The wicked say Let Zion be de-  filed. This is the feeling of the  enemies of truth, but they do not under-  stand the counsel of the Lord: we do.  We come to visit you and comfort you.  We have left our labor at home to take  care of itself, and we are glad to see the  people spend an hour or two to come to  meeting. Let us do right and God will  be our friend. Jacob is but small, but  he will rise, the little one become a  mighty people and the small one a  strong nation. Make yourselves a good  town here, and plant orchards and   vineyards. Let your deed be accepta-  ble before God and you will always be  happy. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Next arose and said as the funeral services  on this occasion not only em-  braced the death of Brother David  Hoagland Cannon, whose tabernacle  now laid before the congregation, but  a great many other Elders who  had yielded up their lives while  preaching the Gospel to the nations of  the earth, an endeavor had been made  to publish these cases as far as they  had come to the knowledge of the  authorities, and Apostle Richards  would therefore read to those assembled  the list already furnished.  After this  Brother Grant wold read one of the  last letters written home from abroad  by the late David H. Cannon 
 385Remarks   By Elder Wilford Woodruff,  delivered in the Tab-  ernacle, Great Salt Lake City, May 19th, 1867.    [Reported by David W. Evans.]    386 - 387I also am a missionary, and I always considered it a great honor to be one. I received a mission when I embraced this work; it has never been taken from me yet. In company with a number of the brethren I have just returned, as br. Taylor has said, from visiting our brethren in the south. We have had an excellent time. We have been over a great many rough roads, traveled hard, and have preached from once to three times every day. We have been taught, instructed, and edified; at least I have a great deal. We have had a good time in visiting the Saints, and as President B. Young remarked in some of his discourses, we have been able to draw the contrast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world. My own experience enabled me to bring that subject home very readily, and I presume it is so with most of the Elders who have been on missions preaching the gospel. I have travelled a great many thousands of miles to preach the gospel without purse or scrip, with my knapsack on my back, and begging my bread from door to door. I have done many things that all the gold in California would not have hired me to do except for the gospel. My natural feelings would forbid me travelling through the world asking for my bread from door to door; I would much sooner labor for it.  387We have been called to preach the gospel; the Lord Almighty has required it at our hands; we would have been under condemnation as Elders if we had not done it. We have done it, and our garments, in a great measure, are clear of the blood of this generation. For over thirty years we have labored to preach the gospel; and we have gathered together a people to these valleys of the mountains, with whom I rejoice to meet. I once asked the Lord to let me go and preach the gospel. I had a desire to preach the gospel in its beauty, plainness, and glory, and to show the worth of the principles it contained. I felt that they were of as much value to my fellow men as to me. The Lord gave me the privilege I asked for, and I believe that I have preached to the nations of the earth as much as I desire; if duty should not require it, I never wish to go and preach to the world again. I have had my day and time at it; still, if called to go, I presume I should go as I have always done. But I do enjoy the society of the Saints, I love home, and I love to travel through these settlements, and to see the boys, the girls, the men, and the women parading the streets to welcome the President and his brethren; and, on our return here, to meet with greetings from ten thousand Saints brought peculiar meditations to my mind. It brought home very forcibly the contrast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world.  387QZ1In my early missions, when preaching in the Southern States—Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky—I have waded swamps and rivers and have walked seventy miles or more without eating. In those days we counted it a blessing to go into a place where there was a Latter-day Saint. I went once 150 miles to see one; and when I got there he had apostatized, and tried to kill me. Then, after travelling seventy-two miles without food, I sat down to eat my meal with a Missouri mobocrat, and he damning and cursing me all the time. That is the nature of the Southern people—they would invite you to eat with them if they were going to cut your throat. In those days we might travel hundreds and hundreds of miles and you could not find a Latter-day Saint, but now, thank God, we have the privilege of travelling hundreds and hundreds of miles where we can find but little else. I regard this as a great blessing.  387 - 388Our missionaries are going abroad under different circumstances from what we went. We had no Zion, no Utah, no body of Saints to give us any assistance. We were commanded to go without purse or scrip, and we had to do it. We trusted in the Lord, and he fed us. We found friends, built up churches, and gathered out the honest and meek of the earth. Times have changed since then. These brethren are going to the nations of the earth where starvation stares many of the people in the face, and where it is hard for millions to obtain the necessaries of life. The people here are wealthy, and it is no more than right that we should impart of our substance to help those who are going on missions. I hope the brethren and sisters will help liberally, and will impart sufficient to send the brethren to their several fields of labor.  388I rejoice in the gospel of Christ; I rejoice in the principles that have been revealed for our salvation, exaltation, and glory. I rejoice in the establishment of the work in these mountains, and in our southern settlements. As has been already said, the Lord has blessed our brethren there. It is a miracle to see those settlements when we consider what the country was such a short time since. The city of St. George is second to none in the Territory unless it be Great Salt City; and I doubt the latter being equal to St. George, when we take into consideration the population of the two places. They have better buildings and improvements there, according to numbers, than we have here. At Toquerville, too, they are laying fine foundations for stone and brick buildings, and they are improving all through the southern settlements. The soil there is so sandy that it looks as if it would require two men to hold it together long enough for a hill of corn to grow. Like the waves of the sea, it is ever on the move. It contains, too, a good deal of mineral which destroys the vegetation and everything with which it comes in contact. Some of the brethren have spent as much as two thousand dollars to render an acre of land productive; now they have fine gardens and vineyards growing, and, strange to say, though the country naturally looks like a desolate, barren, sandy, unfruitful desert, still the cattle are fat, all kinds of stock look well, and everything was green and flourishing in the settlements as we passed through them. The whole of that mission at its commencement presented a most forbidding aspect, and really had so many discouraging features that men were compelled to work by faith and not by sight. Now, however, the soil is blessed, the climate is delightful, and plenty and prosperity attend the labors of the people. To show you the difference of the climate in the country, and of the district of country a few miles this side of it, I need only mention that the morning we left Beaver there was ice along the creeks, but when we got to Toquerville, two days' travel further south, we found the apricots half grown, the peaches as large as peas, the cotton-wood trees green and in full leaf, altogether looking like another country. It is a different climate altogether from what it is in these higher places.  388The hand of God is in all the operations we are trying to carry out. We have to build up Zion independent of the wicked; we have got to become self-sustaining, and the Lord is inspiring His prophets to preach to us to lay the foundation for the accomplishment of this work. The day is not far distant when we shall have to take care of ourselves. Great Babylon is going to fall, judgment is coming on the wicked, the Lord is about to pour upon the nations of the earth the great calamities which He has spoken of by the mouths of His prophets; and no power can stay these things. It is wisdom that we should lay the foundation to provide for ourselves.  388 - 389QZ2With regard to the Word of Wisdom, I must say I was agreeably surprised to see how generally the people are taking hold of it. We did not see much coffee or tea, and I do not think that one in the company drank a drop of it. I rejoice in this; it is going to make the people more wealthy, it will save us a great deal of means, besides preventing our being poisoned to death, for these things are poisoned, and the Lord understood that when He gave the Word of Wisdom many years ago. The people are improving in a great many things. There is a very good spirit and feeling among them, and the feeling to carry out the purposes of God is general.  389I rejoice in this work because it is true, because it is the plan of salvation, the eternal law of God that has been revealed to us, and the building up of Zion is what we are called to perform. I think we have done very well considering our traditions and all the difficulties which we have had to encounter; and I look forward, by faith, if I live a few years, to the time when this people will accomplish that which the Lord expects them to do. If we do not, our children will. Zion has got to be built up, the Kingdom of God has got to be established, and the principles revealed to us have to be enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints. There is no principle that God has revealed but what has salvation in it, and we, in order to be saved, must observe His laws and ordinances. Where is there a man or woman who does not wish to be saved? All wish to be saved; all desire salvation, and to enjoy those blessings which they were created to enjoy. The gospel has been offered to this generation for the purpose of saving them in the Kingdom of God if they will receive it. I rejoice in all the principles revealed to us, and the more I see, hear, and learn, the more I am satisfied of the importance of the revelations that God has given to us. As President Young remarked in one of his sermons south, "Whatever the Lord reveals to this or any other people does not ignore anything revealed before." No part of the gospel is superfluous. It is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, and all the inhabitants of this world and all others have got to be saved by it, if saved at all. It is necessary, therefore, that we receive and obey all of its principles. When the first principles of the gospel were revealed to us we rejoiced in them. After them we had other principles revealed, the principle of baptism for the dead, for instance. We did not know anything of that until about the year 1840, on our return from England. I rejoice in that principle. It is a great blessing that there can be saviors on Mount Zion. It is a glorious principle that we can go forth and erect temples and attend to ordinances for the living and the dead; that we can redeem our forefathers and progenitors from among the spirits in prison. They will be preached to in prison by those spirits on the other side of the vail who hold the keys of the Kingdom of God, and we will have the privilege of attending to ordinances in the flesh for them. Then, again, the blessing that God has revealed to us in the patriarchal order of marriage—being sealed for time and eternity—is not prized by us as it should be. When that principle was revealed, the prophet told the brethren that this kingdom could not advance any further without it; "and," said he, "if you do not receive it you will be damned saith the Lord." You may think this very strange, but the Lord never reveals anything that He does not require to be honored.  389 - 390What would have been our position if this had not been revealed? This principle is plain, clear, and interesting; without it not a man in this Church could have either wife or child sealed to him for eternity, for all our marriage covenants before were only for time, and we, as a Church, had arrived at that point when, in order to insure a full salvation, it was necessary to reveal this principle. It is a great blessing to us. We love our wives and children, and wish to enjoy their society, but the thought of separation would mar all the happiness that the Saints might otherwise attain. The Saint who aspires to salvation and glory wants a continuation of family ties and associations after death. Without this principle we were like the rest of the world—without any such hope. From the day the apostles were slain until the Lord revealed this principle in the last days, not a man ever dwelt in the flesh who had wife or child sealed to him for eternity, so that he could enjoy their society in the resurrection. That was just our position before this ordinance was revealed, but now, whether we have one wife, two, three, or as many as the Lord sees fit to bestow upon us, when we come forth from the grave our families remain with us in the eternal world. So it is with every principle the Lord reveals—it is good for His people in time and eternity.  390Brethren and sisters, QZ3let us be faithful, and look at the promises of God as they are contained in the gospel of Christ, and never treat lightly any principle, no matter what it is, whether it be faith, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the resurrection of the dead, eternal judgments, the marriage covenant, baptism for the dead, or any other ordinance that the Lord has revealed; they all belong to the kingdom, are necessary to salvation, and the responsibility of carrying them out rests upon this people. We know that the world looks with contempt upon us and upon the institutions of the kingdom of God. They do not object to institutions that are corrupt and ungodly. The world is flooded to-day with evil and wickedness, and the earth groans under it. But because we as a people follow the example of Abraham, in taking more wives than one, we are universally decried and despised. The Christian world profess to believe in Abraham, and he, through obedience to the command of God in this respect, was called the "Father of the faithful," and the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem will each be named after one of the twelve patriarchs, his descendants, and the sons of a polygamist, and fathers of all Israel. Even the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came to lay down his life to redeem the world, was through the same lineage. He was of Judah; He was the King of the Jews and the Savior of the world.  390These principles are as righteous to-day as in any other age of the world when governed and controlled by the commandments of God. Let us prize all the principles, revelations, and blessings that God has revealed to us; let us treasure them up, do our duty to God, to one another, and our fellow men.QZ4No man has any time to sin, to steal, swear, or break any of the laws of God if he wishes to secure a full and complete salvation; but we must all do the best we can, laboring with all our might to overcome every evil, for it will take a whole life of faithfulness and integrity for any Saint of God to receive a full salvation in the presence of God.  390May God bless us, and give us His spirit, and wisdom to guide and direct us into all truth, for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 APOSTLE WOODRUFF    felt moved upon to speak a few  words to the Conference, by bearing   his testimony to what John had just  finished saying, as also to what Can-  non had promulgated as Gospel in  the forenoon, for they were oracles of  God, and it was not the privilege of  one man alone to have revelation, but  it was the duty of all the Saints to be  full of revelation, so that they might   walk through life with the light of  the Holy Spirit shining on their path.  It was the duty of those who shoul  charter ships for the emigration of the  Saints to have it; it was the duty of  Brother John D. T. McAllister, to  be filled with the spirit of revelation  every day in the St. George Temple,  so that he could prevent any man  from robbing another of his dead  wives. The Prophet Joe Smith bap-  tized thousands before he kept any  record of the baptisms. But he did  not know it all. For twenty years  the endowments had been given in a   little house in the Temple book, but  the whole light had not been revealed  then. Only after the St. George   Temple was completed did the Lord  let the priesthood into    THE WHOLE SECRET.    The he showed the Prophet   Brigham many new things, as also  the preacher, Woodruff. There were  about twenty men and twenty women  administering the holy ordinance in  the St. George temple, all for no-  thing and boarding themselves. Far  be it from the Apostles to make mer-  chandies of the gifts and blessings of  God, but the brethren and sisters  must live by eating, and therefore  the many who are intending to go  through the temple from this time  forward, must take along their tem-  ple offerings to lay upon the altar.  As to [bing], take hold and go to,  now, said the preacher, and pay what   you owe.    THERE'S MILLIONS IN IT!    Your dead will be after you in  tones of ten thousands thunders if you  don't, because they are interested in  this great work. And now, our sis-  ters, God bless them forever, said  Wilford, let them go too and lay up  the wheat while it is cheap, for the  great famine which is coming upon  the world. "Somehow or 'nother,  the brethring have got an idle in  their heads, that there ain't agoin' to  be no famine, but there is; the Lord  has said so, and the Lord don't lie,  for he's agoin' to pour out the [le]  of his wrath upon the wicked, and  spread war and contention among   the nations of the earth with fire and   sword and pestilence and famine on  every band, and lay up your wheat,  brethring. Plant out mulberry  fields instead of these pasty,  rotten cottonwoods, and use 'em  too, and latch to the counsels of the  holy priesthood, and manufactured  everything we need so that if the  Latter-day Saints are cut off from  the rest of the world they can be in-  dependent, for Babylon is going to  fall; the Lord has said so, and    THE LORD DON'T LIE,    and support our own publications  especially the Woman's Exponent for  the sixtera on it are doing a noble  work." Here the Apostle caught his   breath and subsided. 
 THE CHURCH DEBT.  The venerable president of the church  rose at the close of Elder Teasdale's  remarks, saying, "I have felt it my  duty to speak of a subject that has  been brought up here to-day, and that  is the debts of the church. Person-  ally, I never run into debt myself. I  made that a rule from my boyhood up,  but since I have been in the church in  this valley I have certainly deviated a  long way from that principle. I think  it my duty to tell you how I came in  debt as president of the church and  trustee of a trust. It is well known  how the United States Government  took possession of all of the property  of the church. Receivers were sent to  Utah, one of whom I will mention.  His name was Dyer. He came to me  and demanded all of the personal  property of the church. He demanded  $500,000 in money, believeing we ought  to have that much. We did not have  that much money, or anything of the  kind; had never had it. President Tay-  lor had given to the different stakes in  Utah for the support of the poor,  wheat and vegetables, and other stores  which in all the Territory amounted   to about $150,000. Mr. Dyer gathered  up these accounts and wanted money  for all that. As a compromise, rather  than have lawsuits brought against us  in every stake of Zion, we agreed to  pay him $75,000, and did so. Then  wherever he could find a sale of land,  or money expended and paid out, or  any other expense the church had gone  to, he demanded it of us.    Rather than have lawsuit after law-  suit, we agreed to give him this money.  It amounted to about a half million of  dollars. We had never had that much  money. It was money we had paid out  and given away; but we went to the  banks and borrowed $500,000 and gave  it to him. We gave our notes for it  and that was the beginning of our  debts. We have had to pay rent for  our own church property. When a por-  tion of our money was restored to us,  we had the blessed privilege of taking  up a portion of our notes. The money  was about $100,000 short, that amount  having been spent by the receivers.  We are still in debt, however.    President Woodruff thought the  members of the church were doing  wrong in not supporting their poor  and paying their own way. The peo-  ple, he thought, ought to do more than  they were doing and take the burden  off of the church. He was satisfied the  church wanted to get out of debt, and  if the various wards and stakes would  keep up their tithing and fast offerings  it would help a great deal. The presi-  dency wanted to help all it could, and  would do so, but it could not respond  to all that asked. In conclusion, Pres-  ident Woodruff was thankful that the  United States Government had done so  well in restoring their property, and he  felt confiedent that the Government  would yet return the real estate of the  church. 
 LETTER FROM ELDER WOODRUFF.  FARMINGTON, Connecticut, March 21, 1846.    To the Saints scattered abroad through the Eastern Churches.    DEAR BRETHREN: Having just returned from Liverpool to   the United States, for the purpose of gathering my family and  kindred with the Saints west of the Mountains, and feeling a  deep interest in the welfare of the Saints at large, I have made  enquiries concerning the prospects, intentions and presidency  of the eastern churches, and was informed that Elder Little  was appointed to take the Presidency of the eastern churches,   charter ships for their emigration, &c. I have since had an   interview with Elder Little, and have seen his appointment by  the Quorum of the Twelve in Nauvoo, and I feel heartily to re-  commend the appointment to all the Saints, and I greatly de-  sire that all will unite as the heart of one man, in sustaining  him in all his operations and labors, and especially in the char-  tering of ships for emigration. The Saints will find it much   to their advantage to be entirely united in their movements in  the emigration. I hope and trust the day is not far distant,  when all the Saints in these eastern lands, may be making pre-  parations to gather with the main body, either by sea or land.  Those who go by water, will go with less expense, and be ena-  bled to take much more with them than they could by land.    That peace, union, and the blessing of God, may rest upon  you, and that you may be gathered together and build up Zion,  is the prayer of your brother in the covenant and faith of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ.    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 Great Salt Lake City  Dec. 1, 1862.    Hon. J. M. Bernhisel    Dear Sir    I have received your letter of Sept. 27 concerning  your business. I have delayed writing until the present, hoping  to be able to settle it. I have spoken to Bollwinkel & Brockbank  to day, they promised to settle soon; but Bollwinkel refuses  to pay any interest.    Concerning Abraham Taylor, he wishes me to  give up the note and take the property that is mortgaged,  but he does not wish to pay any thing more on the note, he told  me he had given you a deed in addition to the mortgage, which  I think is not correct, as there is no deed on record. What I wish  now to know is, whether I shall give up the note and take a   deed of the property that is mortgaged, or foreclose the mortgage,  sell the property and indorse the amount received on the note;  if so please send me a regular power of attorney & necessary papers.    Respectfully your &c    W Woodruff 
 Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 11, 1863.  Mr. Aphek Woodruff, or any man by the name of  Woodruff.    This is to certify that I am in search of Aphek  Woodruff son of Azmon Woodruff, formerly of Farmington  Hartfort Co, Connecticut, but now living in Palermo,   Richland Co, New York. Aphek Woodruff went to California  some 8 or 10 years since, and corresponded with his Father  and friends until about 1858, since which, nothing has been  heard from him, and the supposition has been that he was dead  either by fair or foul means. Yesterday I met with Mr.  David Smith who said that he was a Baptist Minister living  in Cherokee lane, and said he was acquainted with a  man by the name of Woodruff, and thought it was Aphek  Woodruff. If this letter reaches any man by the name  of Woodruff, will you please inform me by letter, if you  know of any man in California by the name of Aphek  Woodruff, and where a letter can reach him, and you will  much oblige a large circle of his friends    Yours respectfully  W.

Y[o]u are wronging yourself to let such   an entry remain uncancelled. You should  either comply with the decision or take an   appeal and abide the result.

 Nauvoo Oc[tobe]r 15, 1844    Dear Brother:    I embrace an oppertunity   now offered of sending you a few lines, as I feel  convinced that any intelligence respecting Nauvoo   must be interesting to you, particularly as you  left at a time of general excitement.    Since you left we have had the governor here   with four or five hundred troops: his ostensible  object for visiting us was for the purpose of resis-  ting a mob which had it was supposed would  gather against the mormons, under the pretext  of gathering together to have a grand military pa-  rade & a wolf hunt; but for the real object of  mob & plunder. I had a visit from his excellency  & did not forget to remind of some of his movements  in his Carthage compaign. It is unnecessary   to enter into particulars as you will have received all   the information relative to this affair in the papers.  I must however relate one little anecdote. The Gov.  one of his aids, Major Beker, a member of Congress, & some   other gentlemen of distinction we're in the Governor's   room at the "Mansion."  Generals Rich, Miller & myself   called upon him we entered into a desultory conversa-  tion, & among the general remarks, his excellency stated    [sideways text]  Unless requested I shall not send anymore of the Times & Seasons than will   fill your complement of the present volumne.

 Dear Sister Kimball your letter to Brother Kimball of Dec 8th has just came to hand  & has done us much good yes it was truly cheering to our feelings to hear from  you & to learn that the Saints from England had arived safe We have felt great  anxiety to know how they got along. We expected they would have many trials  to Run through. Yes we have all got to come up thrugh great tribulations  in order to have our Robes made white in the Blood of the Lamb, but   shall we murmur or complain at those things may God forbid. I had  rathr suffer afflictions with the people of God for a season than the farer  of the world or treasures of the Earth, that I may overcome & reign with  the Saints.

 Great Salt Lake City  Feb. 11, 1863    Mr McCommons    Dear sir,    I received your letter of Jan. 31, and in  reply would say, that coffee, sugar, and Black Pepper  have generally been sold at .40 per lb, but they are   now .50 to .70, this in part is in consequence of the   discount on green backs. Domestic and Prints have been  generally about .30 a yard, but now .40 and .50.   Cotton yarn is selling for 700 and 750 per bunch.  Men's shoes 300 to 400, Boots 6.00 to 800, nails .35 to .40,   none for sale. 8x10 glass .25 to .30 each light, &c, &c.   You speak of powder, I would recommend you to  bring some good powder, good rifle, will find a ready  sale from 100 to 150 per lb, also an assortment of   shot, large enough for Geese and Ducks, sells .40 per lb.  Bring some good caps for Rifles and U. S. Yaugers,  Do not bring any lead, as it is manufactured at the  mines in this Territory, costs about .25    Extract of dogwood, Madder, Cudbar, Cochineal & Indigo  are in great demand here, as the people do their own  coloring.

Dear Brother—Can you  give me any information where  we can get hold of the two pio-  neer flags that we used at the  last celebration—one of the  crossing of the Upper Platte,  and the other containing all   the names of the Pioneers.    We want them for our great cele-  bration on the 24th inst., which   I look to be the greatest of any  celebration we have ever had.    We shall look for you to be with   us on that occasion, and bring  anybody with you that was in   the pioneers.    Please write us as soon as you   W Woodruff

 G. S. L. City,  Mar. 31, 1864.    Hon. J. F. Kinney:    Yours of the 9th inst., advising us of  your return from mailing under brass lock a large quantity  of seeds for distribution is received; together with a  quantity of franked labels for which please accept our  gratitude. There never was a time in Utah when  seeds were more valuable and desirable than at the  present time. Seeds heretofore have been on our Gardener's  hands a drag, but this season before our citizens were  aware the strangers in our midst emptied the feed stores  early, and when the citizens began to enquire for seeds there  was not a pea, an onion seed, nor a top onion to be  found except they were willing to pay fabulous prices  for them.    The Historian's Office, Bro. Geo. A. and myself  & no doubt the others named have received their seeds.    After the receipt of your 2 sacks containing  Agricultural Reports & McLellan's Report, the historical  corps spent the day addressing and carrying to the P. office  according to your directions. We also kept an alphabetical  account of names addressed to Bro. Geo. A. assisted  me in this matter, and in fact his memory, which  ever retains a lively remembrance of all our enterprizing  and philanthrophic citizens, was taxed to its utmost tension  that no distinguished citizen was passed; and that our  distribution might savor of as little invidiousness as possible    7 p.m. I have just received per mail a sack of seeds 
 G. S. L. City, June 8, [18]61.    To the Mayor and City Council  of Payson: An Act approved Jan. 18,  1861, confers upon our Honorable body the right  to control the waters of Spring creek for the use  and benefit of the citizens of Payson. We beg leave  respectfully to crave your special care over the Gardens  and nurseries located at Spring Lake villa, as the   seeds, roots, bulbs, plants, and trees there in cultivation  are iof immense value to the city of Payson in  particular and the Territory of Utah in general.    In our humble judgment the said Gar-  dens are entitled to far more consideration than any  ordinary farm crops, and should not be placed,  by any means, on a level with them in their propor-  tion of water. I have heard that the John-  sons put on airs and treated the Council of  Payson with indignity and disrespect. If this  be so, have the goodness as fathers to wave the in-  dignity and have a fatherly eye to the general  welfare of the commonwealth. Excuse our in-  terference in your municipal affairs, it is from  a zeal to promote agricultural, horticultural,  Pomological, Floracultural interests in Utah County

DEAR BRETHREN:    I am instructed by the First Council of Seventies to forward   to you the enclosed communication from the 24th Quorum of Seventies. The   Council desire to know what answer they shall make. The difficulty in the   case arises from the statement that the Bishop has been instructed not to  endorse the names of brethren suggested as missionaries, unless they can   give written guarantee that neither they nor their families will require  assistance during their absence.    The Council desire me to ask if such are the instructions to Bishiops.    Very Truly Your Brother,    John M. Whitaker.  Gen[eral] Sec[retar]y.

 August 25, 1895.    Brother Wilford Woodruff:    I received your letter   and will let you know my circum-  stances at present.    I belong to an irrigation company   which is known as the West Point   Irrigation Company; I being one of the   directors of the company.    This Irrigation Company and Moroni   are in a big dispute over the water,  which will cause a law-suit this fall.  and if we should loose the water my   farm will be of very little value, and   it would be very hard for me to make   a living for I am in quite a large   debt at present.    Therefore I couldent possibly get ready  at such an early date.    John S. Beal.    L. S. Andersen Bp.    I trust the water difficulty will be   settled without recourse to the courts,  and am in favor of his being granted  sufficient time to settle his difficulties am  icably, and get ready to go on his  mission, and when so ready to report.

I am greatful to you for the   consideration — shown to myself and family, i  would give us great pleasure to be present, but  circumstances over which we have no control  will make it impossible for us to do so.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff    Dear and respected Brother    I received your very welcome letter by last evening's mail, and was  much pleased on seeing it. Hitherto, letters were addressed to W. W. Cluff  the President of the Stake, about the Seventies, and the Pioneers—and the first  I knew of them, was by reading them in the Priesthood meetings—I received  one in Geo. Goddard's writing, about the banners, and I answered him to the best  of my knowledge. I addressed all to him, knowing he would faithfully  distribute them to the proper persons.    But your letter to me, gave me as much pleasure, as I fancy you  enjoyed, when the angel first appeared to you, to give you the necessary information  to superintend the ordinances for the living and the dead.    This morning I went over to bro. Williams, to arrange to give a ton of coal  to the first man with a Horse team, who will carry me, banner & to Salt Lake City.  George Goddard being in the Bishop's Office, may know of a Horse team coming out here,  on Monday 19th for a load of coal on tithing who will take me with him to the city,  and he will get his ton of coal, at the Mine, without costing him any thing.    I have also got the first Buckskin Coat made in the Valley in August 1847  which I will bring in, as a contrast to the clothing of 1880, that will require a straight stick  6 or 7 feet long, with a cross piece for the arms. If the Painters would print a slip  "the first coat made by the Pioneers, in Salt Lake Valley, August 1847," to paste on the Coat,  will preach a service in a very few words.    I shall esteem [ink blot] pleasure and a privilege, to ride in the same Waggon with you.  The banner "crossing the Platte river" was got up by donation. If it is not found in the  tithing panary, or the book binder's garret: it was 2 or 3 times put up in the garret of the  Council House, over T. O. Angel's room. Joseph Scofield being dead, I supposed T. O. Angel could  give his necessary information. Perhaps John Kelly, the bookbinder can tell you.    I would like to call the roll to find out who are present, and where living, and any  information about the others, and then make a copy for you.    Praying that your life may be spared, to continue your good labors, in assisting others to  perform the ordiances for the dead, and prepare for the second coming of our Savior    I remain yours obediently, & brother in the new and everlasting Covenant    Thomas Bullock   Coalville July 11, 1880    over

Apostle Wilford Woodruff was delighted  to see so many at meeting, spoke of the unpopularity  of the principles of truth, & the afflictions, & suffering  of our Savior, "In my boyhood I prayed a great deal  to God that I might be permitted to live in a day, &  age in which ministers could be found who taught  the same principles, which we find in the new testa-  ment; the Lord heard, & answered my prayer, & has granted  me that glorious priviledge, spoke of the magnitude of  the labor, resting upon the L.D.S. their inability to  fully comprehend the extent of their mission upon the  Earth, the growth, & progress of the Kingdom of God.

McClellan's reports, and  public speeches from 6 members of Congress. Also accompanying  letter. I believe all came safe according to your directions,  and we all feel to return you our sincere thanks for the  interest you are taking in the welfare of Utah, and the benefit  you are conferring upon your constituents.    Col. Geo. A. Smith, R. L. Campbell & Thos. Bullock  are spending the day in directing those documents to the  most prominent men throughout the Territory, according to  your wishes.    The agricultural report is the best we have ever  received from that Department. The Agricultural society are  making an active escertion this season to improve their grounds  and are laying a foundation to preserve in purity all kinds  of seeds suitable for this Territory. We were much gratified  to learn that there was a prospect of obtaining some more  seeds from the Patent Office through your influence, as they are  very scarce in this Territory.

 Pres. Silas. S. Smith asked the stated that a  brief report would be given, of the different Wards.    Bishop John. C. Dalton " said "the people are generally  poor, ^in consequences of loss of crops by an early frost last fall^ and many have to go from home, to labor for a supp-  ort; but so far as have been ascertained from the teachers,  they are doing as well as could be expected."    John Becroft said "the folks of Scritas,  are getting along peacable, are seeking to serve God  to the best of their ability." H. C. Heiselt  said, "the people of Ephraim are friendly, & peac ^agreeable^  with each other; pay their tithing promptly, & thereby  show their willingness to support the cause in  which we are engaged." T. N. Peterson, reported  the Richfield branch, kind, & generous towards  eachother, & endeavoring to keep the commandments  of the Lord. Apostle ^President^ Joseph. F.

 G. S. L. City, March 30, 1864.    Bishop Thomas Callister:    Elder W. Woodruff has received from bro.  Ashman several letters and a telegram in relation to  the disgraceful charges preferred against Orlando Warner,  concerning which bro. Geo. A. has also received a letter from  you. So far as we can learn the excitement against  Judge King is in consequence of his having admitted  Warner to bail, and whether the Judge accepted an illegal  bond or admitted Warner on his own recognisance has  not transpired. That Judge King would have the  right to admit Warner to bail to a regular term  of court by taking ample security is established by  precedent. The bail would necessarily have to be high  because in chap. 22, Sec. 16, of laws of Utah the pun-  ishment for such a crime is imprisonment for life or  not less than ten years. We would regard a bond  for $3000.00 executed in proper form, conditioned for  the peaceful demeanor of the accused as well as his  appearance at court to answer as sufficient. Art. 4 of  the amendments to the Constitution says: Excessive bail  shall not be required.

 WILFORD WOODRUFF    HISTORIAN'S OFFICE.    March 28, 1887.    Elder Heber J. Grant    Dear Brother:    You asked me a question the last time  we met ehich I was not prepared to answer at the time it was given.  I have gibven the subject some thought and reflection and I now feel  prepared to answer the question according to my views. You asked  me if I knew any reason in case of the death of the President of  the Church why the Twelve Apostles should not choose some other  person to be the President of the Church instead of the Twelve  President of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know of several good  sound reasons which I will now give you. In the first place there  are two or three plain truths which are eternal, everlasting, un-  changeable, and immovable as the pillars of heaven (as far as  this dispensation is concerned) which have been established by the  revelation of God through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  These truths stare us in the face. First, when the President of  the Church dies, who then is the presiding authority of the Church?  It is the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (ordained and organized by  the revelations of God and none else). Then while these Twelve  Apostles preside over the Church, who is the President of the Church[?]  It is the President of the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually as  much the President of the Church while presiding over Twelve men as  he is when organized into the Presidency of the Church and presid-  ing over two men. And this principle has been carried out now for  57 years, ever since the organization of the Church. When Joseph  Smith the Prophet was martyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forth  as the presiding authority of the Church, as ordained of God, with  Brigham Young at their head to preside over the Church and direct  its affairs. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the  First Presidency, which of the Twelve stepped forth to claim the  right to preside over Brigham Young? Not one, nor any other man  except Sidney Rigdon, an apostate. Why did Brigham Young claim the  right of the Presidency? Because he was the President of the  Church while presiding over Twelve men as two men. When President  Young died who was the presiding authority of the Church? The  Twelve Apostles and none else. And who was the President of the   Church? John Taylor. Why? Because he was the President of the  Twelve Apostles. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize the  First Presidency again, which of the Twelve Apostles was moved upon  to claim the right to preside over the Church above John Taylor?  Such a thing did enter into the heart of one of the Twelve  Apostles, nor any other man, except Daniel H. Wlells, and he said he  had a revelation that Joseph F. Smith was the man to preside over  the Church. There was not one of the Twelve Apostles believed a  word of it, and Brother George Q. Cannon was the most opposed to it  of any man in the Quorum of the Twelve. Because President John  Taylor was the President of the Twelve Apostles, and he had been  virtually the President of the Church since the death of Brigham  Young. (Now if Brother Cannon has become converted from this  theory, or any of the Twelve, they certainly must have some very  strong reasons for it. ()    Now, Brother Grant, I have given you  one of the reasons why I consider the President of the Twelve should  be the President of the church in case of the death of the Presi- 
 Los Angeles, California  May 8, 1893.    President Woodruff,  Salt Lake City    My dear Sir    You will probably remember me,   although we have not met for a number of years.    The last four years I have passed in Southern  California, not on account of poor health, or for   the health of Mrs Kinney, as both of us with God's  blessing are well and wonderfully preserved.    I have been deeply alive to all  that has marked the progress of Events in Utah   since my connection with the Territory as Chief  Justice, and Delegate in Congress. The bill  which I had the honor to introduce to Establish   "Statehood," and support with a speech of   considerable length near thirty years ago, published   Entire in the Desert News," notwithstanding all   your struggles to obtain admission, has not  Even yet become a law, which other Territories  with far less population, and I will add  merit, have been received with open arms  into the "Sisterhood"    But my object in   addressing you this letter, is not to recall   the past, or review the present status of Utah,  but to call your attention to a matter that 
 sending any young rooted Grape vines from the Escperimental Gardens  I would like to obtain Child's superb, Diana, and Grizly Frontignan,  and the Delaware. If I could obtain two or three roots of each of the  above kinds; if they can not be obtained from the public gardens,  if they could be sent from a private nursery I would pay whatever  escpense you might incur in obtaining them.    I have watched with much interest your labors in Washington  for the admission of Utah. Your speech upon Fernando Wood  was read with much interest by your friends here. I see by  the late dispatches that they have admitted most of the  Territories around us, but Congress seems to be very silent about  Utah. We hear that you made a speech for the admission of   Utah, we trust we shall have the privilege of seeing it in print  before long. When we have done our duty we shall be contented  and leave the event in the hands of the Judge of all men,  for He will do right, and all things will work together for our  good. I do not know that I can give you any news from  Utah. I believe you are kept advised of all matters of interest  in our midst.    The present signs indicate the driest season we have  ever had; very little snow in the mountains, and the streams  very low. It is a general time of health with us all at present.

 Great Salt Lake city,  Weather office,  September 3rd 1858.    Historians G. A. Smith & W. Woodruff,    Dear Brethren,    your cool explanatory  note of yesterday is filed among the  passing events of the day, as "quid pro  quo;" and, under the highly progressive  christian civil^i^zation of fire, fighting,   fining and murder; awed by the all-  wise, all powerful arm of the great  American Tirshatha, sent by the Czar  of the United States, Nebuchanazar, to  rule the kings and queens; or guard  the Lord's anointed by the pacific  innuendo's of bumshells, bayonets  and the softly manufactured German  and Irish, toys, dexterously kept in  motion by the shining wax dolls  of West point, for the sensible and  long meaning gratification of all  Israel, and Indians, I am very  much obliged to you both for the in-  formation; though truly I was  not appointed by Joseph Smith, to 
 We do not understand that the Judge is required  to find a clerk or attorney on examinations for he then  only sits as a committing magistrate. The committee  of the accused to prison would have subjected the  County to unnecessary expense. What Judge King  has done we have not yet learned but had we been  on the bench we should probably have let Warner  to bail had he got such security as would have  satisfied us of his behavior and appearance.    While there is a strong impression among the  people that Judge King, who is related by mar-  riage or otherwise to a large portion of Fillmore,  and that he and they are danish; we have never  seen aught that would convince us that Judge King  would judicially take any ground, but that which he  conceived to be just; but if he does otherwise it  certainly is your place as Bishop to see that he  as an Elder in Israel is put right.    The Statutes makes the crime of rape the  highest known to the law, except murder in the  first degree. It is therefore not at all  surprizing that the admission of the accused to  bail has produced a popular outburst of rage; and  if the people believe that their rulers would sanction 
 but I am glad to be able to settle the  Esstate so far, what I have done has been  with the consent & council of the probate  Judge Elias Smith. Our families were  all well when I left Salt Lake & my  family is well here I had the pleasure  of preaching the first discours in the  17 ward new Meeting House on the Sabbath  before I left it is a good substantial  building but not finished yet I see from  the reports that you are getting along finely  with the St George Temple I attended the  conference at Ogden & a 2 days Meeting at  Brigham City had good meetings in   both places    please remember me kindly to president  Young, & those associated with you    Your Brother in the gospel of Christ  W Woodruff 
 Apostle Brigham Young spoke, & said "I am  with the testimony, & teachings of the brethren who have  spoken, many new things have been presented to my mind."  spoke of the labors reques[t]ed for the spread of the gospel—  the obligations which the L.D.S. were under to carry it to  the nations of the Earth—the labor of the millennium—the  redemption of the dead who never heard the Gospel,  the importance of obeying all the commandments  of God, which now exist, & which may hereafter be  given. said "I have witnessed the fulfillment of  numerous propecies given through Joseph Smith."  Prayed God to bless his people & preserve them from  the hands of their enemies. Elder John Morgan  was grattified to see the rappid growth of Manassa,  & adjacent settlements of the Saints. said "the  first conference held in this place (Manassa) was  in an old stable which furnished sufficient room  for all present." (the Saints in this place) Exhorted the people  to encourage education—the observance of the word of  wisdom & prayed God to bless all who are engaged in the  cause of truth. Apostle Joseph F. Smith said  "It is impossible for us to receive at one lecture  all the wisdom, & knowledge, which God intends 
 G. S. L. City, March 11, 1859.    Brother G. A Smith.    Dear Sir—As brother Bigler is about to return  home, I feel to write a few lines, and give what news we have.  I call upon the President daily. We have no Eastern mail yet.  We were quite interested in Cradlebaugh's charge to the Grand Jury,  and in his bodyguard, but I think he has done like Sinclair, shot  his biggest gun first. The Indian that went after the nine   horses stolen at Grantsville, has returned with two of them, the others   were killed. He says he travelled 200 miles, got to camp, told  his business, and they said they would kill him for being a traitor.  They brought up three horses left, and then shot down a stud be-  longing to bishop Clark, and dried the meat, & tied the other two up. In the  night the Indian crawled out, took the two horses which were left, fled  for Grantsville and got in safe. He was followed by a band  who went to Stansbury's Island, took all of brother Kimball's herd, some  170, with his wildcat stud, and tried to drive them to the main land,  on the west side of the island. When they were belly deep in   water, they stampeded, went back to the island, fled into the  mountains, and the Indians got none of them. There is now  a guard there.    (Private. When Dr. Forney's interpreter, Jebow, talked  with the Indians at Grantsville, he told them they must not  steal any horses or mules with U. S. on them, and that if they  did the soldiers would follow them and kill them. He conveyed  the idea that they must steal Mormon animals, if any. That 
 Moquis Villiages in safety, spent 3 days with  them in there stone houses on the top of the   mountain, while they had a feast & offered  sacrafize & prayed for snow. (next day snow fell  1 foot deep) They left three of their number as   missionaries with them and four of the Moquis  accompanied Hamblin Home as Embasadors to visit  the Mormons to see if they were the people which   their Fathers had taught them for generations  would come from the west & bring them the   truth in the last days. they came home the   Northern Utah trail. They came to this city &   visited the Presidency and Theater, printing   office, Telegraph, and all places of interest, and   they are highly delighted with all they see. They  are a vary industrious, virtuous, Honest, truthful  peaceful, & intelegent people They have both white  men & women among them, blue & hazel Eyes  & light Hair although they have not mixed blood  with any tribe or people for many generations  They live by the cultivation of the Earth and   make what they wear. they keep sheep, goats,  Jacks, & Jannies, chickins & Turkies, get Honey  Honey out of the rocks & woods. They have seven  villages number about 7000. They are kind to 
 compile the History, of which you  mention till 1842. I am contended  to "let Lyman lie on his own hook".  While, not having denied the faith, I  hold on to what I have in Jackson  co. and the truth as a matter of  fact in full fruition, and fond  hope of "all right" in the End: for  Solomon said, in ##Ecclesiastes 12:13|Ecclesiastez 12:13##—  "To end the whole matter, We must  obey besides fearing the Gods, then  according to its precepts, take heed  for this sustained the first man."    So, with the blessings of a God that  never errs nor "lies," I hope and pray  for a time of greater perfection when  the great day of grog mouthed, pistol-  fisted, bum-shell-bodied, gold  eyed gentiles, and their snake  fanged allies, the mormon apostates,  will be whistling the Devils Reel  round a coal-pit barbacue  of skunks, roasting in brimstone  and devils-dung for the "last  supper of the damn'd; after 
 may possibly interest your people.    While in San Diego  a few days ago, I met a gentleman who   owns Eleven leagues, or about 49,000 acres  of land in a body in lower California, about   twenty miles from San Diego, and four miles  below the border line of this state. This land   as you will readily suppose is a "Mexican   grant" It is represented to be well adapted  to the raising of fruits, and grain, wheat  and all the cereals, has also pastarage with   valleys, and hills, two thirds arable, with   a reasonably good supply of water. The owner   claims to have a perfect title, resides in   Sanfrancisco, and is anxious to sell the   entire tract in a body to one purchaser.  I think it can be had for one dollar and  fifty cents an acre, on reasonable terms.    I simply submit the matter,  and in case you desire further information   it will give me satisfaction to aid you in  any way.    With kind regards, and with   special remembrances to "sheriff Burton"  and other friends in Utah, and with   best wishes for your continued health.    I remain Respectfully   Yours, J. F. Kinney 
 and Lorenzo Snow of Cache and Box Elder counties, who went  on a visit to the Sandwich Islands; they were seven days going  from here to San Francisco, there were some five persons killed  for amusement in the different settlements as they went along;  they had to eat, drink and travel in the midst of Mobs and  Pistol shooting who were practising civilization.    There is a good deal of gold esccitement and prospecting  throughout the Territory. I do not think much has been found  as yet. Judge Titus closed his Territorial Court without any  business, except making some citizens. The Grand Jury meet  again on the 4th April for U. S. business.

 dent. If the President of the Twelve Apostles is not fit to be the  President of the Church, he is not fit to be the President of the  Twelve Apostles. Again, there is another eternal truth stares me  in the face. In case of the death of the President of the Church,  Brother George Q. Cannon, Wilford Woodruff, the President of the  Twelve (whoever he may be); notr any six Apostles combined have not  power to appoint a president for the Church. And as far as the  appointment of Brigham Young and John Taylor was concerned, there  never has been a dissenting voice with the Twelve Apostles. And  I certainly do not believe, should President Taylor die today,  that Brother George Q. Cannon nor any other man could use influence  or argument enough to convert a majority of the Twelve Apostles to  depart from the beaten track laid out and followed by the inspira-  tion of Almighty God for the last 57 years by the Apostles as re-  corded in the history of the Church. As far as I am concerned it  would require not only a much stronger argument than I ever heard,  but a revelation from the same God who had organized the church and  guided it by inspiration in the channel in which it has traveled for  57 years, before I could give my vote or influence to depart from  the paths followed by the Apostles since the organization of the  Church. Again, Presidents John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff are the  only two men now living in the flesh who listened to the words and  charge of Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Twelve Apostles before  his death when he said, "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart for  fear I might be taken away with the keys of the Kingdom ogf God upon  me before I sealed them upon the heads of other men. But I thank  God I have lived to see the day when I have had power to give the  Twelve Apostles their endowlments. And I have now sealed upon your  heads all the keys of the kingdom of God and the powers of the Holy  Priesthood, which God has sealed upon me. And now I roll off the  labor and work of the Church and kindgom of God upon the shoulders  of the Twelve Apostles. And I now command you in the name of Jesus  Christ to round up your shoulders and bear off this church and  Kingdom of God on the earth before heaven and earth, and before  God, angels, and men, and if you do not do it you will be damned."  Now brother Grant, with this declaration and charge ringing in my  ears, should I outlive President Taylor (an event I never expect to see)  I should strongly urge my brethren of the Twelve Apostles to follow  the beaten track marked out and followed by the prophets and apos-  tles for the last fifty seven years. And I have full confidence to  believe that the Twelve Apostles hadve had experience and light  enough to shun any path pointed out to gratify the private inter-  est or any man or  set or men against the interest of the Church and  Kingdom of God on the earth. I once knew not only twelve men but  twice twelve leading men of the church undertake to appoint a  prophet and president of the Church before the death of the Prophet  Joseph, but they apostatized and went to perdition. And it would  be a very dangerous precedent for us to set to depart from the  order which God has pointed out. And it will be a precedent which  the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles will never set from this time  unto the coming of the Son of Man. I was informed that president  George Q. Cannon used the argument in the deeding of the Gardo House  to President Taylor as the president of the Church, that in case of  his death the deed should not go to the president of the Twelve  Apostles, but to the president whom the Twelve Apostles should  appoint (I certainly have no objection to that) saying that in the 
 for a moment such wickedness it would require  a great deal of coolness on their part to await  the tardy operations of the law.

 for us to know." Urged the Saints to use propperly  the talent which God had given them. "The Kingdom  of God is onward, & progressive & man, through obedience  to the laws of God, is destined to attain to the perfection,  & glory of our creator." "I could not be happy (superlative-  ly so) no matter where I might be placed without my  wives, & children with me." Entreated the saints to obey ^the commandments of^ God  & live united.

 night they took nine of the Mormon animals, while those belonging   to the Government were left untouched. Two Mormon inter-  preters stood by and heard it all.)    An officer from the camp told Little Soldier that in  120 sleeps they should wipe out all the Mormons in this land.  Little Soldier was very unbelieving in the matter, and I am of  his faith.    Dr. Forney called upon President Young yesterday. I am  informed by Col. Little that Gov. Cumming wishes him to go  to Provo to watch the movements of things. Gov. C. thinks Cradle-  baugh has committed himself much in his charge to the jury,  in taking his guard of soldiers, &c.    I have got a partial clue to the committee who wrote those  anonymous letters to President Young.    Last Sunday, in company with C. C. Rich and half a  dozen others, I called upon brother Wolstenholme to attend the  operation of taking a stone out of his bladder. They could not  get any chloroform, and they tried ether, but they got an adul-  terated article at Godby's, and after he had breathed it two hours  and used 8 oz. in doing it, we had to give up the job, and leave  him about half crazy, and wait till chloroform could be got.    L. W. Hardy lost a child yesterday. It was buried to day, and  was about two years old. We still have a snowstorm about every  other day, cold weather, and bad roads.

 Great Salt Lake City Feb 20, 1861    Copied    Elder G. A. Smith    Dear Brother    I write to say that in  company with Elder John Taylor I took a mission to the North  last week as far as Brigham City we had a good time much of the  spirit of teaching was poured out upon us & the people seamed to have an  Ear for hearing. We started on Friday preached at night at Farmington   to a large congregation Exhorted to temperance &c. Sunday attended a  conference at Ogden 1200 present. preached all day ordained a High Council  at night had the spirit of God & a good time. Monday Bishop West carried  us to South Webber in a sleigh Met a large Assembly of Bishops & Elders from  the surrounding country. Herd Bishop Richard Cook & his new Prophet  (Joseph Morris) speak an hour & a half in maintaining his calling in  the 7th Angel. Elder Taylor & myself then occupied another hour  then cut off Bishop Richard Cook & 15 others from the Church  organized the remainder appointed Philo Allen to preside over them   united them with Ogden under care of Farr & Wests, then returned to Ogden  Tuesday went to Ogden Hold preached to the people Exhorted to pay tithing &c  had a good meeting, rode to Willow Creek preached in the Evening to a full  House. Wednesday held a meeting in Brigham City from 1 'oclok  till 9 P. M. Taylor & myself preached in the afternoon & seven Elders  bore testimony in the evening much of the power of God rested upon us  J. C. Wright Bore a strong testimony. He will be in his grace soon if the 
 come out with whole sheet, new head, new editor, & full of news.  We feel anxious to hear from you often. Wisdom and true  policy, I think, say, keep cool, keep down excitement, keep from  any open collision to shed blood, and trust in God, who will bear  you off, as he has done heretofore. Our strength is in the God  of heaven, who will fight your battles as he has done. We pray  for you. Give our love and blessing to Hosea, Blair, Kay, Long,  Blackburn, Snow, Wall, and Bullock, and all your associates,  and we say God bless you all forever, and give you a victory over all  your enemies.    I have written a line to Col. Thos. L. Kane. E. T. Benson  has just come in, and he says, send my love to G. A. Smith. He  says he has been trying to pray for the court there, but does not have  much of the spirit of prayer for them.    Yours truly  W. Woodruff 
 appointment of Brigham Young and John Taylor it so happened in those  instances that the president of the Twelve Apostles was appointed  President, but it did not follow that that principle would be  followed out hereafter. And the argument was used to sustain it  that Elder Woodruff prophesied at a Conference at Ogden that  Joseph F. Smith would yet become president of the Church, and we  would have to deviate from the usual course in order to have that  fulfilled. Now if Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy by the  inspiration of the Lord (which I firmly believe he did) it will be  fulfilled as sure as fate, and that too without deviating from the  path marked out by the Lord, and followed by the leaders of the  Church. It was said that that prophecy was recorded. I will also  make a statement, that I, Wilford Woodruff, heard Heber C. Kimball  and BPresident Joseph Young say that they heard Joseph Smith say in   their presence and in the presence of others in 1832, the first  time that Joseph Smith ever had an interview with Brigham Young,  he said Brigham Young would yet be the President of the Churlch, and  that was four years before there were any Twelve Apostles chosen,  and no man knew that Brigham Young would ever be an Apostle (unless  God revealed it to the Prophet). And still, after sixteen years  of revelation and change, Brigha, Young was president of the Church,  without turning to the right or left from the path marked out by  the revelation of God. And that prophecy is alrso recorded. And  there was not one chance in ten for that to be fulfilled that there  is for Joseph F. Smith to be president of the Church in the regular  channel of the order of God.    Now Brother Grant, I have given you my reasons for be-  lieving that in case of the death of the President of the Church, it  is the right of the president of the Twelve Apostles to become the  President of the Church, and that the majority of the Twelve  Apostles will so decide until the coming of the Son of Man. Now  Brother Grant if you have any arguments or light outside of what I  have presented as a path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in differ-  ent from what we have followed as a Church, and will forward it to  me, I will give it an investigation. But I will confess I do not  know the reason why Brother George Q. Cannon has brought this sub-  ject up and made it a matter of conversation several times since the  appointment of President Taylor to the Presidency, or that he should  depart from the principles he so strongly advocated in the appoint-  ment of President Taylor. I see no reason why we should be so  anxious to fix up vbridges to cross over, that we may never see in  this life. (It is a bridge I never expect to cross, for I do not  expect to outlive the President of the Church.) And I think we all  have sufficient business on hand to attend to without troubling  ourselves about affairs we may never see. Of course President  Taylor, like all other men, will die some time. When that day  scomes it will be quite time enough for the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles to attend to organization of the Presidency of the Church.    I will keep a copy of this communication.    I remain your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,    WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 Salt Lake City, Nov. 25/1887    John Bushman    Dear Brother, I received your  letter of Nov. 18 [18]87. I also received one   about the same time from Bro. Nielson  In reply to all these matters, I will  say, I would like a settlement made  with Lot Smith, upon some terms, and  have it stay settled. I realize as well  as any man can, about the temperament  of Lot Smith. I wrote him what  perhaps he would call a very severe  letter. I have not heard from him  since. I know he is abusive at times  to his wives children and friends  But as he seems to have but few  friends, I have befriended him from   principle, for I know there has been   great prejudice against him from persons  in high places. All I want is justice  done, but I am anxious to have this  matter settled for good and get  through with it.

 Parowan Mar 31, 1898    President  Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother  I see by your letter that  I have bean suggested to  go on Mission to the Southern  Stats And I am thankful  that I am worthy of the  call I onely wish that I   more Qualfied.

 Preston July 26, 1895    Prest Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother.    Your kind favor  of March 15 was received some time  ago. But I hope you will pardon me  for not responding to the call. before.  But when I received your letter my family  was not in a good condition. My children  were sick, and have been sick most all the  time since I received your letter.    But now they are feeling better, and things  are beginning to look more bright.    Now Bro. Woodruff under circumstances of  you ^will^ be kind and release me, "untill after  harvest this fall." I will then respond to the  call, and will go where ever you call me  and do the best I can    Soren. J. Peterson    Very good. Let him have till after Oct. Con-  ference, or till Nov. 1, if he prefers. J. F. S

 without funds and about $150 in debt   this much for my financial condition.   My family now enjoyes fair health.   As to the qualifications for the position   you speak of I must say that I   have but a comon education and am   far from being perfect in the german   language, yet, when laboring in that   mission under Bishp. Jos S. Horne   in 1876-78 I was called to do the   same work, knowing my inability   I made it a matter of prayer and   by the belessings of God and much   study I was inabled to do my duty.   In conclusion I will say, that I am   willing to go or to come as God and His   Servants feel to direct, and family or   finances are no consideration when   duty calls having a testimony of the   truth of the Gospel I desire to joyfully   labore in the cause of truth as long as   God will aid and asist me. It is very   hard to raise money down here this fall   there being no market for either grain   or stock, but I trust that God will open the  way. 
 Nauvoo May 4th 1845    Elder Woodruff    Dear Brother    Your letter of date  Febr 26th I recieved about two hours ago by the  hand of Brother Snow. I was glad to hear from   you and learn that you and yours are all weell I  was expecting to write a letter to you tomorrow Sister  Ells told me to day that Br A Fielding was a  going to start this week for England and thought  there would be a good oportunity to send a but I  did not expect to have to reply to one from  you which I am glad to have the privilege to do.  I will say here that I have recieved all the letters  you sent me or at least I have receved 3 the  one with the $10 note came safe to hand. I done  as you requested me with the enclosed letters and  money—your taxes have all been paid punctually  and reciepts taken which I have in my possession  You say "tell me all about every thing you can think of  that I want to hear about"— and make some enquiries  about your gadin & house &c the gardin is under  good culivation it is true some of the fence had  fallen down but I hope you would not indulge the  thought I would let it remain so and let  the pigs destroy the trees and other things the fact  that I have and interest at stake should be an  evedence to you that I would keep the fence secure  from such intruders I would here remark that  I am improving all the garden as Elder Page  did not want any of it I also improve a half  acre of my lot the trees in the garden are all  groing finely we shall have peaches and cherries  strawberies Raspburies and goose buries and a most  every thing else I put on a considerabe manure

 Dec. 4th 91    President Wilford Woodruff  George Q. Cannon  Joseph F. Smith    Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brethren: Your letter of Oct  22nd I received with a thankful heart. Your approval  of changes upon the Continent and method ^of^ sending our conti-  nental emigration is very satisfactory to me. I trust that Bro.  Jack and Spence will post the presidents of the Swiss & German  Missions & Holland at an early day as they have already ap-  plied to me for information respecting the new regeme.    There is great enquiries for the back no. of the "star", say  the first ten volums. Please consider the subject and if you  deem it wise to republish, direct where it shall be done. It might  be published on subscription; people are pretty well Conversent with  what they would get for their money. I believe it would ^be^ a popular  thing to do. I suggest ^this^ only.    I have met with no suitable place to move the office to  so far; but have it in mind, and I beleive it should be moved w[e-]  repracticable [where practicable].    Your favor of the 20th ult. reached me yesterday. Bro.  stauffer was in the office when it came. I was chagrined to find  myself unable to carry out your reasonable suggestions. But he,  Bro. S. has done a good work, exhausted his own means and is now  in debt. I have loaned him a little money to purchase clothes to cover

I was encamped on the Gila River about four five  below where the Indians killed Thurston, on the  night of his death. The Party that killed him  was undoubtedly from the San Carlos Reservation  for we saw signs all along from that place &  were standing guard nights to guard against an  attack from the Apaches. On our way through the  Reservation we had a very good chance to observe the  Character of the Natives. Traveling down the San Carlos  River to its mouth where the Govt Post is situated,  we encountered a great many Apache Farmers  nearly all having good 3 nich farm wagons and  good teams and harness. Each Family, including near  rilatives, have their land set off to them and  all have good wire or Brush fences. at the time  I was there they were threshing and had good  crops of Barley wheat &c. They Market their Barley  at 2 1/2 cts per lb. at the Agency. Nearly all have good  Adobe or Stockade houses, & appear to be in good

 This spring and the prospect now is that I shall  have a plenty of all kinds of garden [sauce] ie if I  am well and able to take care of it-as to the  house their has not been a blow struck on it since  you left Dr Ells did not come in as he agreed  and that part of the house was unocupyed for  several months and Elder Page has not been able  to furnish any lumber yet on account of its  being so scarce but will as soon as it can be obtained  I intend if it is in my power to do something on the  house this summer I should be glad to have it completed  but I hope you will not attach any blame to me for  what has not been done. I think my circumstances will  be a sufficien excuse to you—since last fall I have not  been able to labour scarce any at all. I had a sore  come on my leg which has been very troublesome  and is now very bad. I do not pretend to labor any  except to do a little in the gardin by hobbling about  with my crutch—it is all that I can do to get bread  for my little family I am now scraping up the last   of the flour or wheat I bought of you last fall I  there was but 7 bushels of it that with one bush  which I lost going to mill with what little I have  got along has lasted me till now. Brother Stillman  has not paid me any thing on the order but I have  said enough on this subject. I have no reason to  complain. Eunices health is much better so that  she is able to do some labor which certainly is a   blessing to both of us—our Boy is well—the last  letter we recieved from home was of date Febr 8th  Father & Mother Woodruff were then well and Father  was doing some buisness so that they were living  comfortable he recieved you $5 note Eunice dreamed   the other night that Mother was dead—we want  to hear from them & expect to soon—you speak about  Willy he is well Sister Benbow will tell you about  him as she is goint to write to you—things are  a going ahead in Nauvoo the top stones are now  being laid on the temple and they a are about 
 circumstances. They have about five thousand head  of thorough bred cattle imported By the Govt. for  their benefit. I also saw quite number of fine  horses, Goats sheep &c. financialy they are pros-  pering. All the men you see among them  are arived with good Springfield Rifles, and  plenty of Amunition issued to them at the  agency. Moraly they are in a low filthy condition  the soldiers and freighters in that country are  demoralizing nearly all of the women along the  road through the reservation. The Indians on  this (the San Carlos) reservation number about 5,000, all  told. They claim that they are not in sympathy  with the Hostiles But I think without a doubt  they and them to some extent. The number of   Hostiles on the war path is not known a great  many of the Scouts that were discharged have not  returned to the reservation and it is supposed they  have joined the hostiles. a great deal of damage  has been done by them and the soldiers have  made very little headway in capturing them  The Indians have a very rough country to fight  in and it is almost impossible to get at them  to fight them for they are like the Sons of  Heleman they run and never tire, and can  subsist on what a soldier would starve to death  on. There was three of the hostile scouts sent down  here by Geronimo the Apache Chief, to visit the  Pimas and Maricopas, to try and induce them 
 and make him presentable. He gave his overcoat to Bro. Herman ^before leaving Constantinople^  and came here rather destitute. I gave him an overcoat and he has  given his note to repay the the money loaned him to get asuit of clothes  I am quite sure that neither Bros. Herman nor Schoenfeldt are capa-  ble of following up the good work of Bro. Fred. stauffer. He posted  them and they have a native Brother with them who speaks good  english if they need him, but I took upon Bro. S. as an exceptionally  able young man and I regret that we have no suitable man to replace  him in the Turkish mission. Perhaps you can supply the defficiency.    Last week John W. stood upon his feet and with the aid  of a chair took a few steps for the first time since Sept 30th.    Junius F. Wells arrived Wed. on the city of N. Y. and pro-  ceeded on same night to London enroute to Paris. He told me a tale  that made me sick, and it seemed like a nightmare until day-  light next morning. John has not communicated any of his busi-  ness to me, He has never taken any notice of my application  to him to pay me and I suppose the consequences must be borne  without murmer. I am too much grieved over his situation  to mourn my serious business' complications.    Bro. James Anderson is in very good health and  would not care to be released at present. Bro Osmond  has been seriously ill and I have advised him to go to London  but he has gone to the north of Scotland and is not well enough  to endure that rigerous climate, ^shall^ try to have him take better care  of his body. Whenever it comes right will spell Bro. Anderson  I have taken care of his health all the time. I learn that  R W. Watson is doing well in scotland.    Will communicate with Brethren In Constantinople and  look after Bro. Hermans health.

Our Lamanite brethren in this stake  are doing very well and seem to enjoy a good  spirit, they often inquire about you brethren  in the North and fully sympathise with  you in your trials and the persecutions you  are passing through.    Our Lamanite School is not running now on  account of the hot weather. I will not able to  teach the school this winter for lack of means  to support my family, and I will be forced to  work for their support, outside of the Mission   as there is no provision made to maintain the  The Teachers in that school. Some of the  sisters of this Stake will probably try and  teach the school this Winter, but it needs a  man to govern the Lamanite children as the  most of them are nearly grown. I should  be pleased to hear from you upon this subject. 
 [upside-down text] Sunday afternoon, Feb. 3, I acknowledge receipt of your last from Fillmore  dated Jan. 27th, and will attend to its requirements by the Thursday  mail. I saw Bro. Brigham yesterday, he appears very solicitous [end of upside-down text]    Great Salt Lake City, February 1, 1861.    Brother G. A. Smith—Dear Sir—I will give you  a synopsis of things since you left, as far as I can. First,  upon matters at home. I will say we are all well in the  office, as is your family. The winter has continued up  to this time, with good sleighing, though the snow has  thawed some for several days. Cattle on the west range are  suffering a good deal. I have brought home most of mine  that I could find. J. C. Little's eldest son, Charles, some  14 years old, was buried yesterday. Sick two weeks. Attended by  Dr. Bernhisel. Lung and brain fever. President Young preached  at the funeral, and was much affected. I reported the address in my  journal. On the night of January 30, Hiram Kimball, jun.,  with several other young men, had Catherine Ivins and Anne   Rose in a sleigh, running a race with another sleigh. Kimball's   sleigh turned over and flung the girls on the ice, nearly  killing Miss Rose, nearly broke her head. She was insensible  until this morning. She is some better. Hiram Kimball's   head was bruised badly. A young man of Feramors Little's   was killed in Big Cottonwood Kanyon, by a snow slide, on the  28th ult., while opening a road through the snow. He was  buried on the 30th. Sister Smith received your two letters

 The condition of the mission is satisfactory on the whole.  Tithing is falling off as it always does in the fall of the year  besides many good tith payers have emigrated to Utah this  season. Very little tithing reaches this office it is mostly used  by the Conference presidents to pay rents for Stalls and Conference houses.    Some of the best missionaries we have are the poorest,  and we have helped them alittle, by way of loan, and kept  them from going hungry and naked. The question presented itself  in this wise; assist, or release and send home. and I felt we  could not spare them; ^&^ probably not more than half a dozen  have, or rather are now receiving assistance in this wise. This  climate is harder on the elders, it seems to me, every year, and  the people are more in different to the gospel. The brethren act-  ually feel good, in some localities, to even meet persecution than  suffer the silent contempt of the people.    My wife is improving in health slowly but her heart is  very weak in its action otherwise she is comforable    Bro. John C Cutler is getting on very well with the business.  Myson Jas A.

I  own, brethren, to a certain amount of obtusness in political  matters, however, as Junius says it ^is^ the thing to do ^and^ I am glad to ack-  nowledge that; I am a republican in sofar as republicanism  is in accord with the revelations of Christ and the same rule is

 many of the pupils have made marked advancement  in reading writing, &c. also in singing Sister  Thankful Harmon has trained a very good Choir  of Lamanites so they do good singing in our  meetings. Our Brethren & Sisters that are work  ing in the Mission are doing and feeling well  but all are poor in this worlds good and can  not do all they would like to do. I think if  we were working in the United order we could  accomplish much more good among the  Lamanites, as they all labor more or less on  that principle. I trust that time will soon  come when can labor unitedly to build up  Zion and not be divided in to so many classes  and such diversion of interest. We are very anxious  for the Book of Mormon in Spanish, I think  it will do a vast ammount of good when it  is in circulation. I met an old Mexican acquaintance  that lives in Bacuachi, district of Arisper, Sonora  and he wants to get a colony of our people to  come to that place, they will let our people have  land on easy terms less than three dollars per  acre with good tille and water.

 from Salt Creek and Fillmore. It seems you find much  snow south. The President met with the bishops  last night to make arrangements for raising the ox-teams   in this city to send east. I think the President wishes the city ^people^  to raise at least 200 yoke of cattle in this city. He is getting  out a circular for the Bishops. Concerning the news from  the east, I will say there is a Gentile company formed, who  get some 15 pages telegraphic dispatches from Kearney, through  Cronyn. The Saints have also formed a company for the same  purpose—Elias Smith, Clawson, Smoot, &c., who get the news  from the Gentile Company, until their comes direct from  Kearney. Last week they had some fifteen pages, a synopsis of  which you will find in the D. News of Jan. 30, and the extra of to-  day. But a small portion is published. Last week's Mountain-  eer extra we sent to you at Parowan. Our mails will only   come now twice a month, and the pony once a week. The last pony  got in last night direct to ^from^ Kearney, and brought 22 pages of tele-  graphic despatches, due on tissue paper, which was taken into  President Young's office and all copied. I have just heard it read.  It contains news from all the eastern states up to Jany. 22. Also a   letter from Cap. Hooper, containing printed scraps up to Jany. 12.  The following is a key to the whole matter. Six states have seceeded,  including Georgia, and ^nearly^ all their delegation from ^to^ both houses of  Congress have resigned and withdrawn, and the other slave states 
 applicable to Demorcracy also in my opinion. It is a source  of sorrow to all who love the truth and fair play, to witness  the efforts, of otherwise reasonable men, to cram others with  their peculiar political bias. Passeing the Priesthood of the  son of God our plane and orbit is superior to the ordinary  or extreordinary political trickster; and we can no more  resort to their level in politics than ^we can^ to their Confusion in  religion. Those sweet delicate wispering of the holy spirit must  be preserved on the [sturup] as well as in the pulpit.    There is another subject whish engrosses my thoughts  at times vis: the tearing to pecies of our pe-Edmund-law fami-  ly relations. If the spirit has given me the right under-  standing, the Presidency have not counselled the putting a-  way ^of^ a portion of our wives and advised polygamists to take their  first wives to their bosoms and live with them and none others. I  look upon the family relation in the same light ^that^ I look upon the  church, which is a sympathetic body and when 5% suffered, 95%  suffered also; where one member is afflicted all suffer alike.  I can say to my wives we will obey the law, but I would not  feel justified to say to five senventh of my fam, you must go into outer  darkness ^and live^ while I enjoy all the ^light^ law allows me with one wife;  rather all suffer together and present an actual living protest to  the inhumanity of Congress which has essayed to break in peices  those family ties which are stronger than death. Where is the first  wife who feels to accept an ^this^ advantage accorded by this [illegible] ^great^  wrong to many of her tried sisters? I pray that, there is not one wo-  man in all Israel who joys in the downfall ^misery^ of her sisters. My  feelings are to day that I would much rather endure the Consequences  of living ^openly^ with my wives Catherine, Jane and Lizzie ^so far as the law alone is concerned^ than to live with either  one of them and then do violence to my conscience.

There is still a party laboring hard in  Congress to adopt Crittenden's Compromise measure to save the ship from  sinking, but the South appears to pay no regard to it. Seward is  joining the Compromise party, to try to mend up. The southern states  are taking possession of all government forts, arsenals, custom houses,  mints, &c. A demand has been made of the President to evacu-  ate Fort Sumpter and deliver it to the south. Armed bodies  have arrived in Charleston from the states, Georgia, &c., and it is feared  an attack will be made upon Sumpter. Memphis is build-  ing a battery of 24 heavy guns. Louisiana has forbidden  the entrance of any American shipping into the mouth of  the Mississippi. All pilots are forbidden to take in any  U. S. shipping. The Alabama Legislature makes pilots  liable to fine and imprisonment who may bring vessels into the harbor of  Mobile, and authorizes the commander of Fort Morgan to destroy  the beacon and landmarks at his discretion. The U. S. troops  have concentrated all their force into one strong fort in Florida,  I think; the rest are in the hands of the seceeders. Most of the  southern states are arming as fast as possible. Kentucky has  sent word to the President, that if any troops are sent to take posses-  sion of any of the southern forts, she shall secede, and join the  south.

 Great Salt Lake City, May 25, 1859.    Brother Ilas.    Dear Sir,    I received your kind letter of  March 6th, and was truly glad to get a long letter  from you, and to have you express your feelings freely  upon any matter you wished. I have much I  would like to say upon both spiritual and tem-  poral subjects, had I time, room, and opportunity.  But it is such a difficult matter to treat upon  religious subjects with paper and ink that I very  seldom attempt it. I have always felt an anxiety  for the future and eternal welfare of myself, family,  and friends, and I have felt an interest in the  welfare of the world at large; so much so, that I  have travelled nearly one hundred thousand miles  among various nations, to preach the Gospel of Je-  sus Christ, and for no other purpose than to do the  will of God, and benefit my fellowmen, though  strangers to me.    I know that Mormonism is true, that  the Book of Mormon is true, and that Joseph Smith  was a prophet of God, and was inspired of him  to lay the foundation of the Church and kingdom,  and to establish it upon the earth, to prepare the 
 It is my opinion that the family ties of such long  standing should be vindicated and not yeiled nor be  crowded down before the flimsy web of ^that^ "might makes right."  We cannot afford to be unjust ^to our innocents^ even to purchase immunity  from our enemies. I know you entertain these sentiments  in your breasts, and you do know they are in mine also. I  feel that any prayers are answered and that God is directing  you in this whirlpool of social changes which are taking  place among us. I pray earnestly that He will direct the  hearts of the people to youward and they may know the  voice of the good sheppard in this day of visitation and  trial.    Hoping and praying that you arewell &  desiring to be remembered to the brethren    I remain your brother in Christ.    Brigham Young 
 Kansacse Bill and the Pacific Railroad bill are called  up in the senate and all mixed up up with the Compro-  mise measures, until the business of Congress is like Succotash.  Every body and everything is excited. New York and Brooklyn  were flung into a great excitement, from a report that there was a   secret plan on foot, for 20,000 men, sympathysers with the south,  to sieze the navy yard at Brooklyn. Troops were imme-  diately raised to guard it, and many boats filled with  armed men, &c. The U. S. troops, by order of General  Scott, have taken possession of the post office, custom house,  sub-treasury, arsenal, and all U. S. property in St.   Louis, Mo. The Legislature of Massachusetts has called a  convention proffered men, means, and money to the Pres-  ident; as has New York, to sustain the public property of the  U. S. in the south. The northern states are arming, or  recommending it. Georgia has sent a delegate to England  and France, to negociate with those nations upon commercial  and financial affairs. The southern states are calling  upon the President and Congress to call a national convention,  not to enter into compromise measures, but to amicably di-  vide the property between the north and the south, but the north  do not now wish to do anything of the kind. I will for-  ward you the moutaineer of the 2nd inst.    Yours truly.  W. Woodruff    [sideways text] Febuary 1, 1861  W. Woodruff to G. A. Smith [end of sideways text]

 way for the coming of Christ and the Millenium.  Joseph sealed his testimony with his blood. Brigham  Young is his successor, and is clothed with the same  power and authority. If Brigham's enemies  should slay him, and a thousand after him,  it would not stop this work, for it is the work  of God; he has sustained it from the beginning,  and will unto the end. Every exertion has  been made, for about 30 years, to overthrow and  destroy this Church and kingdom. Not only  have individuals, priests, doctors, lawyers, of all  sects and parties, tried to destroy it, but whole  villages, towns, counties, states, and the nation  itself, with its armies, have been employed for our  destruction. But the more they have kicked, cuffed,  driven, persecuted, fought, and laboured, the more  we have prospered, increased, and grown, and strength-  ened, up to the present day, and so it will con-  tinue unto the end, for the very reason that God   is at the helm; he established this work, and will  control it until the winding up scene.    Nearly all the inhabitants of the earth, with  death, hell, and the devils, are against us, and are  making war upon us, as far as they have an oppor-  tunity, for our destruction. We have but few friends  except God, and his Saints who obey him, and they are  very scarce in this generation. But the Lord has

 fought our battles and given us the victory up to this  time, and he will give it to us to the end, though  the world see it not.    I know that the world, and even many of our  friends, think very strange of our course, principles, and  doctrines, and that we are very wicked and ought to  die. And it seems as though the whole  Christian world have their eye turned towards  Utah, watching for iniquity, and can see no sin  any where else, while the truth is, the cold Christian  Gentile world are perfectly submerged in a sea of  adultery, fornication, and whoredom, and all  manner of abominations, until they are fully ripe  for the just judgments of God Almighty, which  are nigh at the doors, and will soon sweep them,  as with the besom of destruction, from off the earth.  At the same time they lift up their hands and  point with holy horror to the awful crime of po-  lygamy in Utah. And I suppose they would  do the same if they stood before the gates of the  New Jerusalem, all of which will bear the names  of the Twelve patriarchs, the sons of Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob, who were polygamists, having many  wives, who bore sons and daughters unto the   Lord. With these patriarchs the penalty of a-  dultery was death, as in Utah.    I do not wish any of our friends to  borrow any trouble or to be uneasy about me

 Cambridgeport Oct 13th 1849    Dear Brother Badlam    As the steamer is to leave New York  in few days again, I feel disposed to forward you a few lines  again & give you an Index of what News their is going on in this  county the last I herd from you was the letter written at  San Francisco after you had been there 5 days. Your family are  all well up to this date Mary & Sarah are going to a private school  at present. Sister Badlam does not seem to have a chance to sell  much if any varnish. They have vary close work to get along at  present I think. The same is the case with myself, yet when she  calls upon me I divide with, her I hope you will be able   to send sumthing to her this fall in some way, I do not  make this remark because I have a thought that you forgot  your family, I know better than that for I believe they occupy  a strong place in your heart & thoughts day by day, but I  name it because I think It will be a hard matter for  them to depend upon Mr McClure th[r]ough the winter, or to  [Chance]. I will also say that a few days since I recieved a  good letter from the presidentcy of the Church in the valley  of the Salt Lake president Young councelles me to come to  the valley Next summer & bring all I can with me. I am  therefore now making my calculations to go to the west  in the Spring but I do not know how I can get means  to do it with or where it will come from. And if your  circumstances were such as to put any thing in my way to help  me about getting out, I should recieve it with a greatful  Heart & if an oppertunity offered would reward you for it.  As to News I will say that during the Last two weeks the  New York & Boston papers and scores of others papers in  the states are full of Mormonism. The Latter Day Saints  in the valley of the Mountains Have organized an indipendent  Sovreign State Government Appointed a Governor (Brigham Young)  & all necessary officers, & have two Representatives (A W Babbitt &  Dr Bernhisel) to congress to lay before the Government their  petition to be recieved as a State into the Union the whole  procedings are published in nearly all the Eastern papers  & most of the papers advocate the cause & say recieve them into

The military  are finally called out, & stoped it King & his woman are   in jail, who a large mob in Lowell some killed & many  wounded, Mobs & fires have both increased very lot  since you left, roberies & Murders also, I think there is   much more of it in this country according to the population  than in the gold digging. Thomas ^H^ Benton of Mo is falling  to the ground He has many enemies in Mo He has ben  taken by warrets & had to flee from some places for  fear of assasannation in consequence of his politisal  course He seems to be making for himself a bed of thorns  The Cholera has swept off a host of men this season  presidents, Generals, Col, Captains, rich men, Noted men,  Merchants, & Mob men of Ill, Iowa, & Mo, seem to be  marked victims, this year of the Cholera, almost every   day some Noted men are falling. A good many apostates  of the church have died this year & some faithful Saints  Sister Bride Sabra Granger & Mother Bosley are among the  dead,) G. A. Smith E. T Benson, Capt James Br Spencer  W I Appleby & A. P. Rockwood are on the way with  companies for the Salt Lake valley, their path is strewed  this year with many dangers, 36000 gold diggers are on   the same rouad though the South pass of the Rocky Mountains  with 60,000 Head of cattle & Horses Mules &c, many have  died among them & many are retiring but I have herd  as yet of No differently among our people who have gone  this season for the valley the gold diggers have also had a number  of fights among the Indians & in some instances a good  many have been killed upon both sides. Elder O. Hyde  still Edits the Frontier Guardian at the Bluffs.    Elder A. P. Rockwood I am informed lossed ^lost^ all of his goods

Lot advised them to bring more  help next time they came to whip (Lot Smith still lives)    I think it was a good thing the Rifle took the Ball instead of the   Man as it would Naturly make a stir Almost every Polig-  amist in Salt Lake County is arested, except a few they cannot  get.

As I could not speak in public I wanted to say  sumthing so I wrote. I had an interview with B. Y. He went  to Salt Lake But friends & foes know he was coming and he has  had to Dodge and runs risks. He gives a good Account of the  Navajoes hundreds of them are being Baptized All our quorm  quorum are well as far as as I know. Lorenzo is still in   the pen some of his family thinks He will get free in January  but it is a question in my mind The Supreme Court has had no desire  to favor the Mormons in any thing. There was no necessity of his  going there if he had used a little wisdom All his friends & Enemies  know that he spent all his time in the brick House day and night

 this country it is also in commotion & confusion  about one thing or another Ireland has now broke  out in a libel war or sumthing like ^it^ numbers have  been killed & while I am now writing the streets  before my window are crowded with British soldiers  going to take shiping to Ireland to try to put down  the what they call the rebelion. Many parts of Europe  & the Eastern world are exploding with libel wars &  commotions & the Government of England it is thought  are fort [[motioning to the Roman Catholics which has  alarmed many of the protestants in this land. We  can fully see the signs of the Times indicate the  fulfillment of the Bible Book of Mormon Doctrines & Covenants  & all our expectation. I noticed in the account the  Nabor Neighbor gave of the lying the top stone of the  Temple that the work was finished on the Morning of   the Seventh day of the week, that as the Lord finished  his work is the formation of the Earth on that day &  rested so mighty the Saints I liked the [[remarks.

 the union I mail the weekly Herald of this week to you  which is full of the subject & other matters which I hope you  will get for I think a New York Herald must be quite a  treat to you out there I shall mail it with this Letter  to day & direct both to you in care of S Brannan San Francisco  if this is not the right address please inform me in your  next Letter. I have got your three Letters carefully filed  away I think much off them. Mormonism is looking up  in the world, & is now Herald forth to the four quarters  of the globle through the American press. The world has  awoke from their deep slumber, and are startled as though  they were rocked with an Earth quake, in gazing at Mormonism  which they supposed was dead but now behold it rises from  the grave & stands forth in bold relief as an Independant sovraign  state holding in its hand the [FIGURE] key of the North American continent "whose Nobles are of  themselves & whose Governor hath proceded out of the midst of them"  Jer 31 ch 22 vers [##Jeremiah 30:21##]  And they marvel, wonder, & are amazed and know not where these  things will End. All arivals from the State of Deseret, or  San Francisco are looked for with far more interest than  the European Arivals Brother Young informed me that  their wheat Harvest had come in well & would have an   abundant Harvest to last though the year if they were  were not overflowed with gold diging Emigration who would  be oblieged to winter in the valley the[y] had from 10 to 15000  ten to fifteen thousand passed through the vally this season  on their way to San Francisco & they had litterly almost  filled the valley with goods of evry description which were  sold for one half their original cost at New York &  St Louis this movement has set the Saints upon their  legs in the vally as far as goods are concerned. waggons  were bought for half what the Iron cost in St Louis  to make them and a plenty of cattle also. The latest accounts  say that their are 500 waggons between Green River &  Fort Hall entirely Helpless their teams all drowned or died  for want of grass & Hundreds others dying daily the road was  blocked up with broaken down teams & waggons & the  men that wanted to pass was frantice & were fighting &  killing each other & it was a Horrid scene of things, an express  was sent from Fort Hall for assistance to try to save the 
 trunks, Boxes, & every thing of his own & all that anyone  els sent by him from the east, all the goods that He  packed up at your House, what He got for the   Seventies Hall, & all of Sister Sayers property & her Husband  were all lost after they left St Louis for the Bluffs  I think it was by the sinking of a boat.  Brother page is now expecting to go to Indianna this fall  with his family. Elder pearce is now out of work  & has talked some of going to San Francisco I do not  know whether He will or not. Little & Hardy are   still trading I do not know how well they are doing  I got the Guardian & Star regular the work is  still progressing thoughout Europe. Elder Orson pratt  is in deep water but is abundantly able to swim with his  head above water & carry on his back all the Philosophers,  Astronomers, Inquisitors, Learned men & Catholic & Protestant Ministers of Europe  He is cutting a wide swath, building up the Kingdom & doing much  much good. The last European annal informs us that   the Hungarians Armies have been defeted at all ports  & surrendered to the Allied armies of Rusia & Austria  & thus Hungary has fallen. I think Brother Cannon  has prospered in his business this season And thinks some  of going to the west this fall. Mr Russell that figured   at New Bedford & Fall Brier is in the last stage of the  Consumption expecting to depart daily. Brother & Sister  Baldwin Staid with us last night there things are all  on board of Ship. Sister Baldwin was taking with sum-  thing like the Cholera this morning we administered to  her by the laying on of Hands she got well in short  time & we[n]t into Boston. Mrs Woodruff wishes   to Be remembrd to you & also our children. Sister  Voce & Sister Foss are in business together both wish to  be remembered to you. I shall also write to Calvin  I Foss by Brother Baldwin I suppose you have seen   Calvin before this time. remember us to him if you  see him also to S Brannan & any who may enquire after  me That the Blessings of God may prosper you while in   that land & return you again safe to your family is the   prayer of yours in the kingdom of patience Wilford Woodruff 
 or my family. I feel myself much more safe  in Utah than I would in Maine or Connec-  ticut. It is true that we have had some  perplexity, labour, and care in Utah during  the last two years, but we have not had a  tenth part of what the inhabitants of the States  and other territories will experience before  many years pass over their heads. Watch  the signs of the times, for they will soon indi-  cate the storms of war, bloodshed, pestilence,  famine, and tempest, which will visit the  nations of the earth, and the United States  will not escape.    But enough upon this subject. I think  that, the last time I wrote to you, or enemies,  the judges, marshals, gamblers, and speculators,  were trying to get up a collision between the army  and the Mormons, to keep up the excitement, so  that Uncle Sam's money might be freely spent.  But Gov. Cummings, Wilson, the U.S. district  attorney, and others, seeing the illegal course  of the judges, and the evil effects which would  arise therefrom, made a true report of affairs  to the department at Washington, and our  enemies have been waiting in great anxiety  to see which party the government at Washington  would sustain. The last mail brought  word that the President would sustain Governor
