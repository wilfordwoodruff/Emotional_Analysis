I wont sware out a warrent against them for I dont fear any of them they would not scare off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity that I know of. If I am guilty I am ready to bear it their is honor among enemies I am willing to do any thing for the good of the people. I will give the names of one of the gentleman who have divulged the plot his name is Eaton, he will sware to it he is a bold fellow. Jackson said a Smith should not be alive 2 weeks not over two months any how. As concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about it now but If I hear any thing more from them on this subject I will tell what I know about them    as follows. I thought of a figure    ENDENTRY  the limbs but cut the head off first. So the Adversary has laid a plan to cut off the head of the Church with the intention of scattering &amp; destroying the whole body. It was so in the days of Jesus Christ the enemies sought to kill him that the body might be destroyed, which was also the case in the days of Elijah, Daniel, &amp; many of the ancients. I once herd a man say who was opposed to this work that it might be true but it gave Jo Smith power, true said I but if his power be subordinate to the power of God it is right If a man set up a kingdom by the power of God then let others seek power from the same source God sets up kingdoms &amp; pulls down kingdoms this makes men mad that will not submit to the kingdom of God. We all know the result of the power of Moses who was the representative of God. Judging from what is past how will it be when God sets up his kingdom in the last days whether their is a conspiracy now or not I dont know, but no doubt their will be if not know for it has always been so. In the days of the Nephites they had their Gadianton robers. I have not any doubt but that the apostates will join with the others wicked powers to try to put down the power of God. and I am glad to have the power of the kingdom of God tested &amp; when it is fully tried it will stand, I care not what sacrifice I am called to make for such a kingdom, if its friends, welth or even life at the purchase of such a kingdom it is cheap, did the ancient Apostles, Prophets or Saints who died pay two much for that kingdom they did not. It is necessary that men be put in possession of the   ENDENTRY  order to sin as far as they wish that they may go to the highest pitch. How often men lay down their lives for their country &amp; other purposes, much better then to die for the cause of God. Good and righteous men will administer justice &amp; rebuke evil &amp; the church should be clensed from bad men &amp; the Lord will take his own way to clens the Church, we should lift up our voice against wickedness of all kinds, but will the rulers of our land do it no they will not, they will be cowards untill their is no man to fight &amp; then be brave when goverment will not do it some man should take the helm of government that will do it, will it be called treason if the God of heaven should set up a kingdom, may the Lord give you more &amp; more of his spirit light &amp; intelligence untill you are cemented together in union &amp; love Amen    in an interesting manner for a length of time the following are a few Items of his remarks. If according to the remarks in the morning a conspiracy does exhist with the persons that have been named, it is one of those kind of associations that could not exhist in any thing except against the kingdom of God. A word concerning power. History refers us back beyound civilization in treating upon this subject In consequence of power, their is strength &amp; glory whare their is no power it is like flies without any order or rule. I have viewed the nations of the earth &amp; the way they are relaxing in power &amp; the course they are persuing  away till there would not be a man or woman on the earth, and nothing but the hand of God can save it, &amp; this is why God would send Elijah   ENDENTRY  will soon have is to destroy each other, for soon nation will be against nation party against party the rich against the poor &amp; the poor against the rich untill they are destroyed from under heaven Tradition says the pope destroyed the church of God. Rome followed the Church as long as their was a saint &amp; now you say the pope killed fifty millions of Christians you  not a Christian on Earth, for when rome killed the  wanted a pope &amp; God gave them one or permitted them to have one &amp; he killed fifty millions. its true but they were not Christians for they wer already dead, but it was of their own number ownly differed from them in sentiment here was power with a vengance. But as soon as God sends a man to use the power of God, then they are afraid of power. now the world says the religion of Jesus shed this blood &amp; the bible &amp;c but men must be vary ignorant of the bible &amp; the religion of Jesus Christ too, to say such things for it was for the want of religion &amp; the bible that caused the blood to be shed, for God Jesus Christ nor religion had any more hand in it than you had. The power of God &amp; Jesus Christ &amp; religion would have saved if they had had it.    In relation to the power over the minds of  mankind which I hold, I would say it is in consequence of the power of truth in the doctrins which I have been an instrument in the hands of God of presenting unto them &amp; not because of any compulsion on my part. I will ask if I ever got any of it unfair. If I have   ENDENTRY  exercise any compulsion over any man. did I not give him the liberty of disbelieveing any doctrin I have preached if he saw fit, why do not my enemies strike a blow at the doctrin, they cannot do it, it is truth, And I am as the voice of one crying in the wilderness repent of your sins &amp; prepare the way for the coming of the son of Man, for the kingdom of God has come unto you and henceforth the ax is laid unto the root of the tree, and evry tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, God Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down &amp; cast it into the fire.)

He took for the foundation  of his discourse the words of Jesus to the   togetherd as a hen gathereth her chickens under  wings But ye would not &amp;c. He then asked  what was the object of Gathering the Jews  together or the people of God in any age of the  world, the main object was to build unto the   ENDENTRY  unto his people the ordinances of his house  and glories of his kingdom &amp; teach the peopl the ways of salvation for their are certain  ordinances &amp; principles that when they are  taught and practized, must be done in a place  or house built for that purpose this was  purposed in the mind of God before the  world was &amp; it was for this purpose that God  designed to gather together the Jews oft  but they would not it is for the same  purpose that God gathers together the people  in the last ^days^ to build unto the Lord an house to  prepare them for the ordinances &amp; endowments  washings &amp; anointings &amp;c one of the  ordinances of the house of the Lord is Baptism  for the dead, God decreed before the foundation  of the world that that ordinance should  be administered in a house prepared for that  purpose. If a man gets the fulness of God he has  to get it in the same way that Jesus Christ obta- ined it &amp; that was by keeping all the ordin- ances of the house of the Lord. Men will  say I will never forsake you but will  stand by you at all times but the moment  you teach them some of the mysteries of God  that are retained in the heavens and are  to be revealed to the children of men when  they are prepared, They will be the first  to stone you &amp; put you to death. It was the  same principle that crusified the Lord  Jesus Christ. I will say sumthing about the  Spirits in prision, theire has been much  said about the sayings of Jesus on the cross  to the thief saying this day thou shalt  be with me in paradise. The commentators  ENDENTRY  Paradise but what is Paradise it is a modern  word it does not answer at all to the original  that Jesus made use of, their is nothing  in the original in any language that signif- ies Paradise. But it was this day I will  be with thee in the world of spirits &amp; will  teach thee or answer thy inquiries. The  thief on the cross was to be with Jesus  Christ in the world of spirits he did not  say Paradise or heaven. The doctrin  of Baptism for the dead is clearly shown  in the new testament &amp; if the doctrin  is not good then throw away the new testa ment but if it is the word of God then  let the doctrin be acknowledged &amp; it was  one reason why Jesus said how oft would  I have gatherd you (the Jews) together  that they might attend to the ordinance  of the baptism for the dead as well as  the other ordinances the Priesthood  Revelations &amp;c. This was the case on the  day of Pentecost these blessings were  poured out upon the deciples, on that  occasion.   said about the word Hell &amp; the sectarian  world have preached much about it  but what is hell, it is annother modern  term it is taken from  or  nification is a world of spirits,  Hades shaole paradise, spirits in prision  is all one it is a world of spirits, the  righteous &amp; the wicked all go to the same  world of spirits   ENDENTRY  heaven all are equally miserable or equally  happy, but St Paul informs us of three  glories &amp; three heavens he knew a man  caught up to the third heavens, &amp; Jesus  said their were many mansions in my  Fathers kingdom. Any man may believe  Jesus Christ is good &amp; be happy in it &amp; yet  not obey his commands &amp; at last be cut  down by his righteous commandmends  A man of God should be endowed with  all wisdom knowledge &amp; understanding  in order to teach &amp; lead people. The blind  may lead the blind &amp; both fall into the  deatch together;    said concerning God the Godhead &amp;c  the scripture says their is Gods many &amp;  Lords many, the teachers of the day  say that the father is God the son is God  &amp; the Holy Ghost is God &amp; that they are  all in one body &amp; one God. Jesus says or  prays that those that the father had  given him out of the world might be  made one in us as we, are one, but if  they were to be stuffed into one person  they would make a great God. If I  were to testify that the world was  wrong on this point it would be  true. Peter says that Jesus Christ  sat on the right hand of God any  person that has seen the heavens  opened knows that their is three  personages in the heavens holding   ENDENTRY  hath power in himself so the Son  hath power, in himself then the  father has some day laid down his body  &amp; taken it again ^so he has a body of his own^ So has his Son a body of  his own so each one will be in their own  body.  have the testimony of Jesus I have the spirit  of God. But away with Jo Smith he says he  is a Prophet But their is to be no Prophets  nor revelations in the last days; But  stop sir the Revelator says that the testimony  of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so by your  own mouth you are condemned.    in this place for the same purpose that  Jesus wanted to gather the Jews, to receive  the ordinances, the blessings &amp; the glories  that God has in store for his Saints.
