 many not yet comprehended, we believeit will be apparent to all that to makethe organization still more effective in atruly educational sense, some material sup-port at this stage of its history is a practi-cal necessity.It is, therefore, desired that each mem-ber contribute fifty cents a year; thusestablishing a general Mutual Improve-ment fund, which will provide for thepublication and free distribution of thenew Roll and Record book, and uni-form report blanks. The Roll and Re-cord book has been prepared under ourdirection by the committee compiling theManual. It provides for (1) individualcredit of attendance and exercises; (2)general summary of all work done; (3)a complete ward report; (4) a visitors'register; and its use is essential to theprogress of each association.This fund will also provide for ex-penses of other incidental publications,and special educational work among theassociations, which, as you readily nowsee, is indispensable.We feel assured that if the matter islaid before the members in the true spiritof Mutual Improvement it will not onlybe heartily responded to, but be an imme-diate and continuous means of increasingand maintaining a still greater interest inthe noble work.All funds should be sent, with names ofdonors accompanying, direct to the Gen-eral Treasurer, Wm. S. Burton, SaltLake City, Utah, who will send a printedreceipt to each individual for theamount of his donation, and also giveeach individual credit on the general re-cord.Your brethren and co-laborers in thecause of Mutual Improvement,Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F.

 I wish my young brethren to keep inmind that our aim is high. We areaiming for a place in the celestial king-dom of God, to obtain eternal life, thegreatest of all the gifts of God to man.All the honor, glory and wealth of thisworld should sink into insignificance inour minds in comparison with an inherit-ance in the presence of God and theLamb, with all the prophets, apostlesand saints, including our father's house.While one is fleeting and soon passethaway, the other endureth forever.The Lord has said by revelation thatthere are but two churches, one is theChurch of God, and the other is thechurch of the Devil, and all who do notbelong to the Church of God belong tothe church of the Devil. None but theElders of the true Church of Christ willpreach the true Gospel of Christ. Thereis but one Gospel of Christ, never wasand never will be but one. St. Paulsaid: "Though we, or an angel fromheaven, preach any other Gospel untoyou, than that which we have preachedunto you, let him be accursed." ThatGospel is a gospel of faith in JesusChrist, repentance of sins, baptism inwater by immersion for the remission ofsins, and the reception of the HolyGhost by the laying on of hands. ThisHoly Ghost is the testimony of theFather and the Son, and is promised toall those who receive the Gospel andobey its ordinances.I wish all our young people to becomethoroughly acquainted with these firstprinciples of the Gospel of Christ, andbecome qualified to teach them to theirfellowmen. I pray God, my HeavenlyFather, to bless and sustain all theteachers, superintendents and membersof the Primaries, Sabbath Schools andMutual Improvement Associations, andthat the rising generation of the Latter-day Saints in these mountains may beinspired to pursue that course, wherebythey will honor God and their parents,and be counted worthy to stand in theflesh at the coming of the Son of Man,and be prepared to meet the Lord whenHe comes in the clouds of heaven, withpower and great glory, to reward everyman according to the deeds done inthe body, which is the earnest prayer ofyour brother in the New and EverlastingCovenant.Wilford Woodruff.Bury me—bury my faults.

 "Gentlemen of the Congress:"I feel myself very thankful that I havelived in the flesh long enough in this Ter-ritory to behold the faces of such a con-gregation of gentlemen as I see here to-day. It is not my purpose to occupy your time or attention in arguing or talking orconversing particularly upon the subjectsor at least those principles for which youhave gathered together; but what I willsay will be a few words concerning our arrival here, and upon the principal of irri-gation. Fifty-one years ago the twenty-fourth of last July, I entered this valleywith one hundred and forty-three immi-grants, or in other words pioneers. We were led by President Young. This coun-try that we arrived upon was called theGreat American Desert, and certainly asfar as we could see it did not deviate fromthat in the least. We found a barren desert here. There was no mark of the Anglo-Saxon race, no mark of the white-man; everything was barren, dry and desert."We pitched our camp a little distance to the southeast from here about eleveno'clock in the day. We had a desire to try the soil to know what it could produce.Of course all this company—nearly the whole of us were born and raised in the New England states, Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut—had no ex-perience in irrigation. We pitched ourcamp, put some teams onto our plows (we brought our plows with us) and undertook to plough the earth, but we found neither wood nor iron were strong enough to make furrows herein this hard soil. It was like adamant. Of course we had to turn water on it. We would have done anything. We wentand turned out City creek. Weturned over our ground. When we cameto put our teams upon it, of course they sunk down to their bellies in mud. Wehad to wait until this land dried enoughto hold our teams up. We put in our crops and we stayed here one month.During that time President Young laid out this city as you see it today in the midst of sage-brush with not a house within hundreds of miles of us. We built a fort around ten acres, three sidesof adobe walls eighteen feet high, and one side with logs out of the canyon. Wethen returned home and some two thou-sand men followed us. President Can-non here was one of the company that came in after we did."Now what I wish to say is this: You gentlemen come here today; you see thecity, you go through the country. Here are a thousand miles, I might say, throughthese mountains filled with cities, towns, villages, gardens and orchards, and the products of the earth that sustain the people. Without this water, this irriga-tion for which you have met here to-day,this country would be as barren as it wasin 1847 as we found it. This irrigation is what you have met to engage in and giveyour views upon. How I am satisfied itmatters not. Whatever you decide uponin this matter and unite upon, I amsatisfied it will prove a great blessing; notonly to Utah but to every state and ter-ritory where these arid lands are, andwhoever occupies these lands of course has got to have the water to perform thework. We have had to do the same.  We have had to learn by experience and 
 President Wilford Woodruff then ad-dressed the conference. He said in sub-stance: No man occupying the place that I do at this time, addressing a bodyof Latter-day Saints, could answer hisown mind or the minds of those who hearexcept by the inspiration of Almighty God and the assistance of the HolyGhost. If I were to tell this congregationwhich has assembled together as a Mu- 
 mony with, and recognized as a practical help in each ward?Did you confer freely and fully with the Presidency of your stake in superin-tending the M.I.A. work last year?Are you personally acquainted with the education status and progress of each Association in your stake?Is there a general sentiment in your stake for the officers to remain faithful to their work until honorably released?See CONTRIBUTOR, Vol. XI., page 471, also enclosed questions with circularletter of March 17th, 1891, and address, CONTRIBUTOR, Vol. IX., pages 38-40.It will be well for you to plan for hold-ing your annual meeting for sustaining officers in each ward as soon as possible; but the regular weekly meetings should be started up promptly, early in Septem-ber by the present officers, who should not wait for the annual meeting. At the annual meeting it is desirable that the Stake Superintendency should be pres-ent. This meeting should be made general in the ward, and the importance, plan, and purpose of mutual improve-ment work should be brought clearlyand forcibly before the people, and theward officers sustained by the vote of the Saints. If for any cause changes are to be made or vacancies filled theyshould be attended to at this meeting.In the selection of officers the wardauthorities should be fully conferred with and great care taken to choose such persons as are fitted for the positions by popularity, ability, and inclination to dothe work required.As will be seen from the Manual, specialinstructions are given to the members, and each class of officers for their general guidance; to this your attention is directed.As you are aware this great organiza-tion is of such a character that its direct-ing, teaching, training influence extends to the home reading, or preparation of the individual member around the fire-side; thence to his regular weekly pro-gressive lesson or exercise; thence to the monthly joint session; thence to the district and stake conferences, and culminating in the general annual con-ference in June each year. Thus makingthe line of organized work practicallycomplete and progressive.You are also cognizant of the special importance of regular, systematic, pro-gressive reading, thinking, and acting onthe part of the individual member; thuspermanently impressing and establishing him in this universal system of educa-tion, based upon revelation, self-culture, and mutual or associative effort and relation.Education as you know is the develop-ment and use of one's entire self. In other words, the accumulation andproper application of physical, spiritual, intellectual and moral power; or, the de-velopment of correct thought and its ex-pression in righteous words and actions.(See CONTRIBUTOR, Vol XI, page 351.)Praying the Lord to preserve, direct,and prosper you in your work of love,we remain your fellow-laborers in the cause of Mutual Improvement,Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F. Smith,Moses Thatcher. 
 house, and thus started on my missionwithout purse or scrip. Brother BrighamYoung paddled me across the Mississippiriver in a canoe. The difficulties whichI, with the rest of the Apostles, passedthrough in performing that journey toEngland will never be told in history.However, we all arrived in various com-panies in England in compliance withthe commandments of God. We spentthe year 1840 in England, during whichtime we preached the gospel and bap-tized some seven thousand, organizedbranches and conferences in Englandand Scotland, inluding London andEdinburgh. Eighteen hundred of thisnumber were brought into the Churchthrough my labors in Herefordshire,Gloucesteshire and Worcestershire dur-ing eight months, including nearly twohundred preachers of the various denom-inations. About fifty of the preachersbelonged to the six hundred of theUnited Brethren who were baptized intothe Church. After performing this work,and on the twenty-fifth of April, 1841 Iset sail for America on the ship Roches-ter, with my brethren of the Twelve anda large company of Saints, and arrived at New York, May 20th.My son Wilford was born at Nauvoo,March 22nd, 1840, and my daughter SarahEmma died at Nauvoo, July 17th, 1840.I left New York for Nauvoo, via thelakes, and was on the steamer Chesapeake,with my wife and child, when she waswrecked on Lake Michigan, and all camenear being lost; but through the mercyof God we were again preserved fromthe perils of the waters. I arrived atNauvoo on the sixth of October, 1841,where I again had the happy privilege ofmeeting with the Prophet Joseph andApostles and my friends. I spent thewinter of 1841-2 in Nauvoo, attendingmeetings and councils and laboring withmy hands for the support of myself andfamily until the third of February, 1842,at which time Joseph Smith called me totake charge of the business departmentof the printing office, which I attendedto until the twentieth of January, 1844,when I left the office well supplied withmaterials, in the hands of Elder John Taylor. I received my endowmentswith the Twelve under the direction ofthe Prophet Joseph Smith in the winterof 1843. In the spring of 1844, I was ap-pointed a mission with most of theTwelve to go through the Eastern States.On the ninth of May, 1844, I took thelast parting hand with President JosephSmith in his own house with BrotherJedediah M. Grant. He blessed me and bade me God speed, but seemed verysorrowful, as he did in parting with allof the Twelve. I have since been satis-fied that he had a presentiment that it washis last parting with his brethren of theApostles. I attended a conference atBoston, and on the twenty-seventh ofJune, 1844, while at the railway depot inBoston with Elder Brigham Young wait-ing for trains to take us to Lowell, thereseemed to be a dark cloud and sorrowfulgloom come over us, which we could notcomprehend at the time. While I wasat Portland, Maine, and ready to step onboard a steamer for Fox Islands I sawan account of the martyrdom of theProphet and his brother Hyrum, and theSpirit bore record to me that it was true;so I returned to Boston, where theTwelve soon met together, and wehastened to Nauvoo, when we foundthe city enveloped in mourning.After our return to Nauvoo, and set-ting in order the Church, a council washeld, at which time I was appointed togo to England and take charge of theChurch in that land. I arrived in Liver-pool on the ship, John R. Skiddy, onthe third of January, 1845, in companywith my wife and youngest daughter;also Brothers Hyrum Clark and wife,Daniel Jones and wife, and BrothersMilton Holmes and Leonard W. Hardy.I spent the year 1845 in England attend-ing to the duties devolving upon me.During that year I published threethousand copies of the Doctrine andCovenants, and secured the copyrightin London, being the first Europeanedition, three thousand Hymn Booksand twenty thousand copies of theproclamation of the Apostles. On thetwenty-first of January, 1846, I departedfrom England on the packet ship, Ash- 
 all that we have obtained in these moun-tains has been by irrigation. There areportions yet which have not been irrigated, and as one gentleman said here, if you can make two drops of water where there was one, or two spears of grasswhere there was one you are benefactorsto mankind. I say God bless you in your efforts. 
 be to prepare himself to dwell with his Fatherand God in his presence. It is for this reasonthat the millions of spirits that tabernaclehere are sent from the eternal worlds to passa short probation in mortal bodies, and theyare all the children of one father. If we re-ceive the gospel and live its precepts we shallreceive celestial glory; if we reject it we shallbe punished; though we may have a redemp-tion and a glory, but it will be in a diminsheddegree. We should lay these things to heart;we should endeavor to understand our trueposition, and we should do all in our power tobenefit our fellow man and to bring salvationto the nations.I rejoice that the Lord still holds the dooropen, that we still have the privilege of send-ing the Elders to the nations; while this doorremains open we shall continue to preach thegospel to the gentile world. When they re-ject it it will be taken from them and then wego to the Jews, and the ten tribes will come from the north to Zion to be crowned underthe hands of the children of Ephraim. And the remnant of the Lamanites who are cursedbelow all humanity that we are acquaintedwith; who have been filled with the spirit of bloodshed which they have inherited fromtheir fathers; they will embrace the gospel indue time of the Lord. They are of the houseof Israel, and this spirit of war will be takenfrom them and they will become the childrenof God, but not until the gentiles have en-tirely rejected the gospel. Anciently it waspreached to the Jews first and then to thegentiles; in the latter times it will be firstpreached to the gentiles and then to the Jews,the first shall be last and the last first. Thisis the great work which is laid upon us to-day.We should be true and faithful to-day andthen we ought to follow this practice untildeath, and then shall we be entitled to havea crown of life. Is it not more honorable todo good than to do evil; to try to honor and serve God who is our Father and who hasgiven us every blessing than sin against him?Would not such a course bring more happi-ness and pleasure to us than to blaspheme thename of God and dishonor ourselves, bringingdarkness and condemnation to our spirits?I pray that God may bless us and save usin his kingdom, which I ask in the name ofJesus Christ: Amen. 
 tual Improvement Association of the young men and maidens of Zion that Iwas not deeply interested in your welfare,I should deny the faith. Indeed the cir-cumstances in which we are placedcauses me as well as my brethren to havethe deepest interest in the rising genera-tion who dwell in the mountains of Israel.I will tell you why: I realize the fact thatthis world with all its kingdoms, thrones,principalities, and powers, with all its wealth, seas, rivers, lakes, its shipping,telegraphs, railroads, its mines, its goldand silver, the whole of it has to go intothe hands of the young men and maidenswho dwell upon this earth, who stand inthe midst of some fourteen hundred mil-lions of the human family.Had I the power to tell by the visions of heaven, by the revelations of Jesus Christ, what will take place when thisgeneration of young men and womenshall have passed through another thirtyyears of this life, I do not think it would be wisdom for me to reveal it to the world. Nevertheless, I will say that no generation of young people before thishas had greater evidence of the revolu-tions, changes, sorrows or afflictions thatwill overwhelm the world, that will over-take the inhabitants of the earth, than those which are to come to pass in theirtime. The sorrowful fact is before us that never in our history has such a flood of crime and the power of the evil one trying to destroy the children of men been so rampant as now. One thousand mur-ders are committed to-day upon the faceof the earth where there was a hundred, years ago, or even when the Book of Mormon was translated into the English language by the servants of God. Thesame in regard to suicides. Look at the black catalogue of crime in our midst to-day. Why, the world will not realize allthis unless they look at the signs of thetimes, and read them. The signs of allheaven and earth indicate to us that theend is approaching—that the Son of Man is at our very doors.To the sons and daughters of Zion Iwould say: I have done my mission to the world. I have traveled far enough tomake a journey around the world six times within the last fifty or sixty years of my life in preaching the Gospel to the na-tions of the earth. My mission is nowover in that respect, and in the few daysI have to spend here I want to use my voice in the cause of the sons and daugh-ters of Zion.Those who have obeyed and servedGod have always been unpopular with theworld, in every age, from the time ofChrist Himself. The Lord raised up aProphet in the nineteenth century. Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, labored withus for fourteen years after he had orga-nized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; he established a work whichwill stand until the coming of the Son of Man. I myself have traveled with himthousands of miles, and spent a great dealof time in his company. But he is now onthe other side of the vail; so are also thoseApostles who were then with us, among them Brigham Young, John Taylor, Geo. A. Smith, the Pratts, and many among us now will soon follow them. But the Church and kingdom of God is here and will remain to the end.I would say to the young people ofZion. "The God of heaven has laid upon your shoulders the honor and responsi-bility of bearing off this kingdom in yourday and generation. You are called tobuild up Zion, to manifest your faith, tokeep the commandments of God, to ad-minister in the ordinances of the Houseof God both for the living and the dead.This is the work your fathers have laid upon you. Rise up an[d] magnify your call-ing prepare yourselves for the great work of God Almighty which rests upon you. If you are unpopular and persecuted—what of it? What if your names are cast out as evil among men? There is a God in Israel. He holds your destiny as well as that of all nations under heaven, andHe will not fail or disappoint any of HisSaints." To those who are engaged in the primaries, in Sabbath schools, inyoung men's and young women's mutualimprovement associations, let me say, "We cannot be divided in these matters." Having spoken of the excellent workwhich these institutions had accomplishedin the past, President Woodruff alluded to 
 Elder Milton H. Hardy, Provo, Utah:DEAR BROTHER: We are advised thatthe condition of the Young Men's MutualImprovement Associations, throughoutthe Church, is such as to require carefulconsideration and attention from itsgeneral officers; and in our capacity, asthe General Superintendency of theorganization, we feel it our duty to extendto the Associations such encouragementand counsel, as may be necessary to pro-mote their welfare, and put them in theway of securing, to the young men ofIsrael, the blessings that are in store forthem; and that can be secured unto themthrough the medium of these Associations,which have been organized by the coun-sel of the Priesthood, under the inspira-tion of the Holy Spirit, for their especial benefit.The organization, as originally givenand generally maintained, is one capableof securing to all its members (and itsmembership should include all the youngmen of Zion) a taste for theological,historical, scientific, and literary studies;such as should characterize the intelligentyouth of a community of Latter-daySaints.It is the mission of these Associationsto take the lead in this direction, andtheir officers should seek for that knowl-edge and spirit, which will qualify themas leaders, in directing the work of theirrespective Associations.From your long connection with MutualImprovement Associations, and the deepinterest you have always taken in them,we feel that you are qualified to representus, in the detail labor, which we deem at 
 burton, with Elder Joseph A. Stratton,for New York. We had an exceedinglyrough passage of forty-three days. Itwas said to be the roughest passageknown up to that time. We had sevenhurricanes and fourteen gales and lostthe second mate overboard.Arrived at New York on the sixth ofMarch, 1846. My wife and daughterhad gone on board ship at Liverpoolwith a company of Saints, on her jour-ney to Nauvoo, via New Orleans. I leftNew York and visited my father's homein Farmington, Conn., and notified themto be prepared to accompany me toNauvoo. I also visited Ezra Carter andfamily, my father-in-law at Scarborough,Maine, and I took my daughter Phebe,who had been left there and returned toConnecticut. My father, stepmother,and cousin, Betsey Cosset, accompaniedme to Nauvoo, where I again met mywife, who had arrived safely from Liver-pool.I attended the dedication of theNauvoo Temple with Orson Hyde, onthe twentieth day of April, 1846, whilstthe most of the Twelve and many of theSaints, led by President Brigham Young,had crossed the Mississippi river andwere traveling west.I crossed the Mississippi river with myfamily for the last time on the nineteenthof May, 1846, and started west to over-take the main camp. We arrived atMount Pisgah, where there was a largebody of the Saints, on the fifteenth of June. I here found Elder LorenzoSnow, apparently at the point of death,and administered to him. On the twenty-fifth of June I was met by Captain Allen,who had come to visit the camp of theSaints to raise a Battalion to go towar with Mexico. I directed him tothe portion of the camp where PresidentYoung was, and he immediately raisedthe Mormon Battalion of five hundredmen. I consented for every teamster Ihad to go to make up the number,as did others. We formed our encamp-ment for the winter on the west side ofthe Missouri river, which we namedWinter Quarters. On the fifteenth of October I met with a very severe acci-dent. An oak tree fell upon me andbroke my breast bone and several ribs,which came near killing me; but throughthe administration of the Elders and theblessings of God, I was preserved. In the Spring of 1847 I accompanied Presi-dent Young with some of the Twelveand the pioneer camp of one hundredand forty-three persons in crossing the plains to the Great Salt Lake Valley,where we built a Fort, laid out the siteof Salt Lake City and Temple Block and returned to Winter Quarters thesame season. -[The history of whichhas been frequently published.]-In the spring of 1848, I took my wifeand children, by appointment, and wenteast to Boston to gather up all theSaints in the New England States, andtake them to the Rocky Mountains. Ilabored in this capacity until the springof 1850, and sent out several companies.I visited all the branches of the Church in New England and New Brunswick,and organized the last company and ledthem myself from Boston to St. Louis,Council Bluffs, and on to Salt Lake City,arriving in October, 1850, at which timeI settled my family, including my father,in the City of Salt Lake, where I havespent the past thirty-eight years of mylife, attending to the duties of my callingas an Apostle, in the building and dedi-cation of temples, administering in the ordinances of the Gospel therein, andpreaching to the Saints and providingfor my family. I have been deeply inter-ested in the redemption of my dead. Through my own labors and the assistanceof my friends I have been enabled to give endowments to some three thousandof my dead relatives of my father's andmother's house. Among other labors Ihave officiated as a member of the UtahLegislature for twenty-two sessions,twenty of which were in the LegislativeCouncil.I have traveled to Idaho, Colorado,New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada andCalifornia. Since my arrival in thevalley of Salt Lake, eleven Apostles andtwo Presidents of the Church have de-parted this life and passed behind thevail. On the death of President John

 THE following letter has been issued bythe general superintendency, and will be sent to M.I. superintendents and presi-dents.SALT LAKE CITY, October 25, 1892.DEAR BROTHER: You know from the circular letter sent you from this officedated Nov. 14, 1891, that a working fundis necessary, the object of which is plainlyset forth in that letter.Every young man interested in educa-tion and general improvement was calledupon to contribute the nominal sum offifty cents per annum.The plan of this universal system ofeducation, notwithstanding the greatamount of time, means and skilledlabor required, is intended to be, as faras possible, self-helpful, and it should be self-sustaining.Since the conditions enjoined have not been complied with, there must be someobjections, or lack of interest, or dearth of responsibility, or non-conversion tomutual improvement. To meet thesesupposed objections we will enumer-ate: (1) Every association receives a Roll and Record, an expensive book, as you know, free; (2) Every member receives a "Manual," a book of ninety-two pages, the usual price of which is fifty cents, free; (3) You receive blanks, circular letters and so forth, free; (4) THE MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT NORMALTRAINING COURSE has been establishedin the Brigham Young Academy at Provo, consisting of more than threehundred (300) regular progressive re-lated lessons under special professors,the regular cost of which is not lessthan ten ($10) dollars to each student. All this, with many other privileges, isfree to M.I. students, and its benefitsare applicable to the smallest and most remote wards as well as the larger andmore central ones; (5) Stake classesare also conducted free. No one can fail to see that the contribution named is a good investment, even from a busi-ness standpoint, as that which he may receive is many times the amount whichhe is asked to contribute.By a general response we shall be able not only to continue, but also greatly extend this educative work, andit is equally the privilege and duty of every young man to pursue and prac-tically support it.From the foregoing presentation it isclear that the nominal sum of fifty centsper year from persons thus provided forcannot be looked upon in any other light than that of a blessed privilege, and in noway a burden.We trust you will lead off in this mat-ter and inspire others with the samespirit of gratitude and generosity.Your brethren and fellow-laborers,Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F. Smith,Moses Thatcher,General Superintendency Y.M.M.I.A.

 Y.M.M.I.A. MISSIONARIES.The following letter to Stake Superin-tendency has been issued by the General Superintendency,SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,Sept. 5th, 1892.DEAR BROTHER: We desire a numberof representative young men to continuethe general missionary work among theImprovement Associations.You will therefore please confer at oncewith the Presidency of your Stake andwith their indorsement select the namesof . . . . . . . . . representative young men with ability and inclination to per-form missionary labor.Forward these names to this officewithout delay that the First Presidencymay have time to consider them beforetheir names are presented to the general conference in October next. Their en-tire time will be required in the field, the first five weeks of which will be prepar-atory work in the M.I. Normal Course, and the remainder of the three monthsdevoted to traveling and laboring amongthe young men of the Associations in Zion.In making this selection endeavor to take men from the M.I. ranks, avoidinginterference with the Sunday School interests, and see that they have the full indorsement of their Bishop, andthat they can and will devote themselvesexclusively to filling this mission.Your fellow laborers,W. Woodruff,Jos. F. Smith,Moses Thatcher,Gen[era]l. Sup[erin]t[enden]cy. Y.M.M.I.A.Address: Geo D. Pyper,Secretary Y.M.M.I.A.,P.O. Box 520. Salt Lake City. 
 the Relief Societies, which he said had been a great blessing to this people.It has not unfrequently been said by this and other nations, "You Mormons are not fit to live." Hard things have been said against us; and there have been so many lies told about us that nobody knows what is truth.Some time ago I came down here witha whole car load of ministers on their way to attend a conference, and as we passed by the Sixteenth Ward schoolhouse one of the gentlemen sitting at my side remark-ed, "Mr. Woodruff, what is that build-ing?" I replied that it was one of our schools. "Schools!" he exclaimed, "do you have schoolhouses?" I replied thatwe certainly had—that we had twenty Church schoolhouses in this city. "Why!"he rejoined, "I am surprised; I did not know before that you 'Mormons' had aschoolhouse; I did not even know that youtaught anybody!" A man of his standing should have known better but that is justthe way with the world today.Do not be discouraged or fear that the Lord will fail any of you. This kingdom will increase in power and glory, the king-dom of God will increase until all thosegathered together are prepared for the coming of the Son of Man.God bless you and all those who are laboring in these Societies. You are up-on a good mission. Here you havean army of young men, maidens andchildren; to save them is your mission,and God will bless you in it. May ourheavenly father pour out his spirit uponZion, prepare Jerusalem for the return of the Jews, gather together the scatteredfrom the nations of the earth, and prepare all for the coming of the Son of Man. 
 DEAR BRETHREN: The Brigham Young Academy Normal Summer School holds its regular annual session at Provo,beginning Monday, August 7th, and con-tinuing two weeks.We have made arrangements with the faculty for a special course of instruction for officers of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations.We desire you to send one young man suitable as a M.I. officer from each Ward in your Stake, and one representative from the Superintendency of your Stake, to take this course of instruction at Provo.Forward his name direct to us, Box B, and two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) to the General Treasurer, William S. Bur-ton, 118 South, Second West Street, Salt Lake City. This amount will assist in de-fraying the expenses and will be credited to the association thus represented on its M.I. fifty cent fund.Please give this your prompt attention, as the names should be in by the fifteenth of July.Expecting a ready and full response,We remain,Your brethren and fellow laborers,Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,Jos. F. Smith,First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 Taylor, the responsibility of presiding over the Church fell upon me, in con-nection with the Twelve Apostles.At the close of this sketch I wish to say a few words to my young friends. I have had experience and testimony suffi-cient in my life to satisfy me, beyond a doubt, of the truth of the fulness of theGospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to Joseph Smith, whom the Lord raised up to lay the foundation of His Church and Kingdom of God upon the earth, in thisthe last dispensation of the fulness of times. Mormonism, so-called, is true. The truth of which this generation willlearn when they come before God tojudgment, if not before. All the revela-tions of God as proclaimed in the Bible,Book of Mormon and Doctrine andCovenants will have their fulfilment intheir appointed time. Not one jot nor tittle will fall unfulfilled. Darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, and infidelity reigns in a great measure among the children of men; but the greatest infidel that lives will finda God when he gets into the spirit world,and a just Judge, who will judge all men with a righteous judgment, and rewardevery one according to the deeds donein the body. Woe unto all men, who reject the testimony of Jesus Christ and persecute the Saints of God, no matter in what age of the world they may live.I wish to say to the young men in Zion,you have a great destiny before you, both in this world and in the world tocome. You have a long eternityawaiting you and a great responsibility. As your fathers are passing away the labor of the Church and Kingdom of God will rest upon you. I have confi-dence in you, to believe that you will qualify yourselves for the great duty andwork which lies before you. The des-tiny of the Church and Kingdom of God in the latter days is decreed by theGod of Heaven, and I do not believethat God has made that decree without preparing an element to do His work, in carrying out His purposes.Therefore, I say to the young men of the Mutual Improvement Associations, that the God of Israel has called, chosenand ordained you as messengers of lifeand salvation, to qualify yourselves to prune the vineyard for the last time and labor while it is called day and preparefor the coming of the Son of Man.That God may bless you to this end, is the earnest prayer of your brother andfellow laborer in the Church and king-dom of God.Wilford Woodruff. 
 His angels charge concerning us and they do all in their power for oursalvation."15. In the testimony of a life-time addressed to the Y.M.M.I.A.he said: "I have confidence in you to believe that you will qualify your-selves for the great duty and workthat lie before you." After tonight may he feel the same confidence inthe young ladies.16. "This work depends on no man or set of men; God can and will fill any man's place who proves him-self unworthy, and He will permit no man to lead this people astray."17. "The spirit of revelation belongs to the Priesthood."18. "We are blessed with power and authority to redeem both the living and the dead."19. "The Lord is determined to raise up a people that will worship Him, and if He has to whip and scourge and drive us through a whole generation, He will chastiseus until we are willing to submit to righteousness and truth, or until we are like clay in the hands of thepotter."20. "I would exhort my youngfriends not to cherish selfishness, but if you have any, get rid of it as soon as possible. Be generous and kind-hearted to all, especially to your parents."21. "It is better to suffer stripesfor the testimony of Christ than tofall by our sins and transgressionsand then have to suffer afterwards."22. "I have been a member ofthe Church over sixty years, one ofthe apostles fifty-five years, and thepresident for a short time, and Ihave never performed any ordinance without the assistance of the Holy Ghost."23. "The time is here when theveil shall be lifted, and the hearts ofthe young men and women shall beturned to the work of the Lord."24. "This Gospel has caused prophets, elders, and saints to re-joice. It has nerved up their spirits with fortitude and strength, and borne them up against every oppos-ing influence; this has been the case in every dispensation when this light and power have been enjoyed by the children of men."25. "I knew the Prophet Joseph both in public and in private, have worshiped with him, and run horse races with him over the public square, and in every duty of life hewas a man to be loved and revered." 
 To the Officers and Members of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:The near approach of the date for the dedi-cation of the Temple of our God moves us toexpress with some degree of fullness our feelings to our brethren, the officers of the Church, who with us bear the Priesthood of the Son of God, and to the Latter-day Saints generally; to theend that in entering that holy building we may all be found acceptable ourselves, with ourhouseholds, and that the building which we shalldedicate may also be acceptable unto the Lord.The Latter-day Saints have used their means freely to erect other temples in these valleys, and our Father has blessed us in our efforts. Today we enjoy the great happiness of havingthree of these sacred structures completed,dedicated to and accepted of the Lord, whereinthe Saints can enter and attend to those ordi-nances which He, in His infinite goodness and kindness, has revealed. But for forty years thehopes, desires, and anticipations of the entire Church have been centered upon the comple-tion of this edifice in the principal city of Zion.Its foundation was laid in the early days of oursettlement in these mountains; and from thatday until the present, the eyes of the membersof the Church in every land have been lovingly directed toward it. Looking upon it as theTemple of temples, the people during all theseyears have labored with unceasing toil, undi-minished patience, and ungrudging expenditureof means to bring it to its present condition of completion; and now that the toils and thesacrifices of forty years are crowned so success-fully and happily; now that the great buildingis at last finished and ready to be used for divine purposes, need we say that we draw nearan event whose consummation is to us as apeople momentous in the highest degree? Far-reaching in its consequences, as that occasion is certain to be, what remains for us to say in order to impress the entire Church with a sense of its tremendous importance?On this point, surely nothing; yet may weoffer a few words upon a phase that directly touches it. No member of the Church who would be deemed worthy to enter that sacredhouse can be considered ignorant of the prin-ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much to pre-sume that every one knows what his duty is toGod and to his fellowman. None is so forgetfulas to have lost sight of the admonition that wemust be filled with love for and charity towardour brethren. And hence none can for a moment doubt the supreme importance of every member of the congregation being at peace withall his or her brethren and sisters, and at peacewith God. How else can we hope to gain theblessings He has promised save by complyingwith the requirements for which those blessings are the reward!Can men and women who are violating a law of God, or those who are derelict in yielding obedience to His commands, expect that themere going into His holy house and taking part in its dedication will render them worthy to receive, and cause them to receive, His blessing?Do they think that repentance and turningaway from sin may be so lightly dispensed with?Do they dare, even in thought, thus to accuse our Father of injustice and partiality, and attrib-ute to Him carelessness in the fulfillment of Hisown words?Assuredly no one claiming to belong to His people would be guilty of such a thing.Then must those who are unworthy cease toexpect a blessing from their attendance at theTemple while sin unrepented of still casts its odor about them, and while bitterness or evenan unforgiving coolness exists in their hearts against their brethren and sisters.On this latter subject we feel that much mightbe said. In the striving after compliance with the apparently weightier matters of the law, there isa possibility that the importance of this spirit of love and kindness and charity may be under-estimated. For ourselves, we cannot think of any precept that at present requires moreearnest inculcation.During the past eighteen months there hasbeen a division of the Latter-day Saints uponnational party lines. Political campaigns havebeen conducted, elections have been held, and feelings, more or less intense, have been en-gendered in the minds of brethren and sisters upon one side and the other.We have been cognizant of conduct and haveheard of many expressions that have been verypainful to us and have grieved our spirits.We know they have been an offense unto theGod of peace and love, and a stumbling blockunto many of the Saints.We feel now that a time for reconciliation has come; that before entering into the Temple topresent ourselves before the Lord in solemn assembly, we shall divest ourselves of everyharsh and unkind feeling against each other; that not only our bickerings shall cease, but thatthe cause of them shall be removed, and every sentiment that prompted and has maintainedthem shall be dispelled; that we shall confess our sins one to another, and ask forgiveness one of another; that we shall plead with the Lord for the spirit of repentance, and, having obtainedit, follow its promptings; so that in humblingourselves before Him and seeking forgiveness from each other, we shall yield that charity and generosity to those who crave our forgiveness that we ask for and expect from heaven. 
 NORMAL INSTRUCTION.To Y.M.M.I. Stake Superintendents:DEAR BRETHREN: The importance of related, systematic, progressive work inthe Mutual Improvement Associations,as well as other organizations among usas a people, cannot be over-estimated.In our letter of September 1st, 1891, toyou we introduced the M.I. Manual,Part I. It is gratifying to know that the Manual is proving a practical aid as was intended. Now the next step in advanceis the preparation of efficient leaders toconduct this educational work in the various wards; and to accomplish this theMUTUAL IMPROVEMENT NORMAL COURSEOF INSTRUCTION has, upon our recom-mendation and with our endorsement, been established in the Brigham Young Academy, Provo, where representativeyoung men and young women can besent from the various stakes and wardsto receive a course of teaching and train-ing that will prepare them to properlyconduct the association work in their wards on a truly educational plan, of which theology is the base.You will, therefore, please confer at once with the Presidency of your Stake,and with their advice and counsel, in-struct the president of each associationto confer with his Bishop, by whose ad-vice and counsel the selection of students will be made to fill this mission.The Course of Instruction is five weeks,and the tuition is free. The first class ofseventy-five students completed its course or work an the 5th inst., and thesecond class is now in session.Your selection should be made care-fully and as soon as practicable. Thenames of those called to this missionmust be forwarded direct to AssistantGeneral Superintendent, Milton H. Hardy, who has been assigned to theChair of M.I. NORMAL INSTRUCTION. He will list and classify the names, andnotify you when they can enter, as the number in each class will be limited.Each student selected should receive a writing to that effect, signed by thebishop of the ward and the president ofthe association.Praying the spirit of your calling to bewith your constantly,We remain,Your fellow-laborers,Wilford Woodruff,Jos. F. Smith, Moses Thatcher,General Superintendency. 
 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH,April 27th, 1892.Elders Willard Young and Thomas Hull,City:DEAR BRETHREN: We acknowledgereceipt of the report of your labors asmissionaries to the Y.M.M.I. Associa-tions of Davis, Weber, and Box ElderStakes, which was read to us to day. We are pleased with its spirit and tone, andnote with pleasure the interest taken byyou in the performance of this mission,from which you will consider yourselveshonorably released. The suggestionsyou offer in regard to the importance ofplacing under proper control the amusements of our young people, such as theatrical entertainments, dancing parties,and social gatherings of every kind arefully appreciated, and we hope that stepswill be taken to carry them into practicaloperation. We sensibly feel that thereis no greater field of labor connected withthe work of God upon the earth to-daythan that of seeking to uplift our youngpeople morally and spiritually, and tothrow around them safeguards againstthe prevailing evils of the world.Praying the Lord to bless you, andmake you efficient laborers in the workof building up His Zion, we remain, withkindest regards,Your brethren,Wilford Woodruff,Joseph F. Smith. 
 chastity of our daughters and sisters.God has placed upon us that require-ment. It is not for you to lead theminto dangerous paths; it is not foryou to leave them to be despoiled; it is your duty, and you are underobligations to preserve them free andvirtuous, pure and holy. Any na-tion or people permitting the foun-tains of life to become contaminated,will die, as did Greece and Rome. If we can keep the fountains of life pure, individuals may fall, but solong as the body politic is sound, there is hope for the future. Amen.Superintendent B. S. Hinckley of the Utah Stake said he sensed theimportance of his position in stand-ing before the Conference. It is an auspicious occasion. Gathered to-gether are the representatives of theYoung Men's Mutual ImprovementAssociations of Zion. It seems tome we have been born under mostauspicious circumstances—circum-stances designed to mature thegreatest and purest people on earth. How many there are who lay every-thing upon the altar, and put forththeir best efforts for our benefit! Do what they may for us our salvationdepends upon personal effort.We have in Utah Stake a good organization, but I am a new workerand do not take any credit to myself. While ours is the banner Stake ofZion, we have but forty-five percentof the elligible members in ourassociations.Choir sang the hymn, "Though inthe outward church below."Benediction by Elder W. H. Pettigrew.SUNDAY, 2 P.M.After invocation President Wil-ford Woodruff spoke as follows:Being a member of the Presidency of the Mutual Improvement Associa-tions, as well as one of the First Presidency of the Church, I feel it not only my privilege but my duty to address this assembly as a society of young men and maidens, the ris-ing generation of this community of people known by the world at large as Mormons.The President of the Church has been referred to as the head of thisorganization. The Lord in almost every age of the world has chosen weak and unlettered men to bear the Priesthood, and He has chosen whomsoever He would in this day and time; and the only marvel I have is that He should have chosen so weak an instrument as I am to be the President of this, His Church. But that is the business of the Lord and not mine. Occupying the position that I do, and having passed my eighty-eighth year in the flesh, and living upon borrowed time, so to speak, I can have no reason to ex-pect that I shall dwell a great while in your midst. Therefore I feel in duty bound to give some counsel tothe young men of Israel who are present today.There has never been a genera-tion of the sons of God upon this earth, from Father Adam down to this present hour, upon whose shoulders rested greater responsibility than rests upon the young men and maidens of Israel today; and if they were able to appreciate what their Creator requires at their hands and the responsibility resting upon them, it would not be said in this stand, as it has been said here today, that one-half of the young men of certain wards were not connected with the Mutual Improvement Associations.  I feel very much gratified with the results of the labors of those who have worked and do work in the cause of mutual improvement, also those of our sisters who are connect-ed with the Primary Associations.  Many of our aged sisters at first took hold of this work, and called the little children together, and taught them things of God, as their minds were able to comprehend them. Among them was Sister Eliza R. Snow, who labored in this 
 THE CONTRIBUTOR.JUNIUS F. WELLS,  EDITOR.Salt Lake City, February, 1892AMNESTY.THE following petition for amnesty hasbeen presented to the President of the United States:SALT LAKE, Dec. 19, 1891."We, the First Presidency and Apostlesof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, beg respectfully to representto your Excellency the following facts:"We formerly taught to our peoplethat polygamy, or celestial marriage, ascommanded by God through JosephSmith, was right; that it was a necessityto man's highest exaltation in the life to come."That doctrine was publicly promul-gated by our President, the late BrighamYoung, forty years ago, and was steadilytaught and impressed upon the Latter-day Saints up to a short time before Sep-tember, 1890. Our people are devoutand sincere, and they accepted the doc-trine, and many personally embraced andpracticed polygamy."When the Government sought to stamp the practice out, our people, al-most without exception, remained firm,for they, while having no desire to opposethe Government in anything, still felt that their lives and their honor as men werepledged to a vindication of their faith;and that their duty towards those whoselives were a part of their own was a par-amount one, to fulfill which they had noright to count anything, not even theirown lives, as standing in the way. Fol-lowing this conviction hundreds enduredarrest, trial, fine and imprisonment, and the immeasurable suffering borne by the faithful people, no language can describe.That suffering, in abated form, still con-tinues."More, the Government added dis-franchisement to its other punishmentsfor those who clung to their faith and fulfilled its covenants."According to our faith the head of our Church receives, from time to time,revelations for the religious guidance ofhis people."In September, 1890, the present headof the Church, in anguish and prayer,cried to God for help for his flock, and received permission to advise the mem-bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that the law command-ing polygamy was henceforth suspended."At the great semi-annual conferencewhich was held a few days later, this wassubmitted to the people, numberingmany thousands and representing everycommunity of the people in Utah, andwas by them in the most solemnmanner accepted as the future rule oftheir lives."They have since been faithful to the covenant made that day."At the late October conference, aftera year had passed by, the matter wasonce more submitted to the thousands ofpeople gathered together, and they againin the most potential manner, ratified the solemn covenant."This being the true situation and believing that the object of the govern-ment was simply the vindication of itsown authority and to compel obedienceto its laws, and that it takes no pleasurein persecution, we respectfully praythat full amnesty may be extended to allwho are under disabilities because of theoperation of the so-called Edmunds and Edmunds-Tucker laws. Our people arescattered; homes are made desolate;many are still imprisoned; others arebanished or in hiding. Our hearts bleedfor those. In the past they followed ourcounsels, and while they are thus afflictedour souls are in sackcloth and ashes."We believe there are nowhere in the Union a more loyal people than theLatter-day Saints. They know no othercountry except this. They expect tolive and die on this soil."When the men of the South, whowere in rebellion against the government,in 1865, threw down their arms and asked for recognition along the old linesof citizenship, the Government hastenedto grant their prayer. 
 Thus may we come up into the holy placewith our hearts free from guile and our souls prepared for the edification that is promised!  Thus shall our supplications, undisturbed by athought of discord, unitedly mount into the earsof Jehovah and draw down the choice blessingsof the God of Heaven!As your brethren, sustained by your vote and in your faith as the First Presidency of the Church, we have this to say to the Latter-daySaints, in our individual as well as our officialcapacity: If there is a single member of theChurch who has feelings against us, we do notwish to cross the threshold of the Temple until we have satisfied him and have removed fromhim all cause of feeling, either by explanation or by making proper amends and atonement; neither would we wish to enter the sacred por-tals of that edifice until we have sought an ex-planation, or amends, or atonement, from anyagainst whom we may have either a real or fancied grievance.In now announcing this course for ourselves, we say to all the other officers of the Church that we desire them to follow our example. We wish them from the highest to the lowest andthroughout all the Stakes and Wards of Zion totake heed of this counsel. Let them invite allwho may have feelings against them to comeforward and make them known; let them thenendeavor to correct any misapprehensions ormisunderstandings which may exist, or give re-dress for any wrong or inury that may havebeen done.We say the same—and when the officers have taken the course indicated we wish them to saythe same—to the individual members of theChurch. We call upon them to seek to have the fellowship of their brethren and their sisters, and their entire confidence and love; above all to seekto have the fellowship and union of the Holy Ghost. Let this spirit be sought and cherishedas diligently within the smallest and humblest family circle, as within the membership of thehighest organization and quorum. Let it per-meate the hearts of the brothers and sisters, theparents and children of the household, as wellas the hearts of the First Presidency and Twelve. Let it mellow and soften all differences be-tween members of the Stake Presidencies andthe High Councils as well as between neighbors living in the same ward. Let it unite young and old, male and female, flock and shepherd,people and Priesthood, in the bonds of gratitudeand forgiveness and love, so that Israel may feelapproved of the Lord, and that we may all comebefore Him with a conscience void of offense before all men. Then there will be no disap-pointment as to the blessings promised thosewho sincerely worship Him. The sweet whis-perings of the Holy Spirit will be given to themand the treasures of heaven, the communion of angels, will be added from time to time, forHis promise has gone forth and it cannot fail!Asking God's blessing upon you in yourendeavor to carry out this counsel, and desirousof seeing it take the form of a united effort onthe part of the whole people, we suggest that Saturday, March 25th, 1893, be set apart as aday of fasting and prayer. On that occasion we advise that the Presidencies of Stakes, the High Councils, the Bishops and their Counsel-ors, meet together with the Saints in theirseveral meeting houses, confess their sins oneto another, and draw out from the people all feelings of anger, of distrust, or of unfriendlinessthat may have found a lodgment; so that entire confidence may then and there be restored and love from this time prevail through all the con-gregations of the Saints.Wilford Woodruff,George Q. Cannon,Joseph F. Smith,First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
 cause faithfully during the latter part of her life. The Sunday Schools, too, are a very important institution in our Church. President Young was moved upon in very early days to organize the Sabbath Schools in these valleys. Many have labored faithfully to carry on the work, and others have taken hold of it, until we have today, I understand, almost a hundred thousand children belonging to the Sabbath Schools. They are taught the Gospel of Christ. Theyare taught the duties of children to parents; the importance of their es-chewing evil and ceasing from sin, and praying to God to keep them in the paths of virtue, holiness, right-eousness and truth.Then the young men and maidens of Zion have been organized into what has been termed Mutual Im-provement Associations. Too much importance cannot be attached to any of these organizations and their interests. We look to the Mutual Improvement Associations for our Elders, for our missionaries. We goto this body of young people, and take from them men to go into the vineyard of the Lord to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Do our young men comprehend this? I fear not, but many of them do, and many of them have entered upon this work.  And such are prepared from child-hood to pray and obtain the Spiritand power of God, the Holy Ghost, the revelations of heaven, enabling them to go forth, bearing the holy Priesthood to warn the world, con-vert the honest in heart and gather them to Zion to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. Up-on your shoulders, young men of Israel, rests this duty today. Yourfathers are passing away. Joseph Smith laid the foundation of this Church. He lived but a short time.  Like the Savior he died a martyr.  He lived but a little longer than the Savior did. Jesus labored only three years and a half after entering upon the active duties of the ministry. Jos-eph labored in his mission some fourteen years, I believe. He stood at the head of this dispensation.  His spirit was kept in the spirit world to tabernacle in theflesh in fulfillment of promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Ephraim. Through their posterity he came forth and laid the founda-tion of this Church, and organized it in all its beauty and power and glory and strength and Priesthood, by the authority of God. I do not know how many there are in this house who knew him, but there are some who were acquainted with him for years. Before he was called away he organized the Church of God with prophets, apostles, teachers, gifts, helps and governments, and there were given unto him, and by him sealed upon the heads of the Apostles and Elders of Israel the holy Priest-hood, the apostleship, the keys of the kingdom of God; and these Apos-tles were commanded of God to round up their shoulders and bear off this kingdom or they would be damned. I am now the only man living in the flesh who was present when that communication was given to us. My presence with you must necessarily be limited. I cannot stay a great while longer, and don't expect to; but I know it is my duty to do what I can in laying be-fore the rising generation their duties.  I am especially anxious that our young people should sense the great responsibility that must sooner or later rest upon them; and that they should bear in mind the fact that they were kept in the spirit world thousands of years to come through the loins of the ancient patriarchs and prophets in our own age and generation for the very purpose ofcarrying on this great latter-day work. God called upon us and He will call upon you and our posterity after us, to rise and warn the genera-tions in which they live; to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth that their gar- 
 "To be at peace with the Governmentand in harmony with their fellow citizenswho are not of their faith, and to share inthe confidence of the government andpeople, our people have voluntarily putaside something which all their livesthey have believed to be a sacred princi-ple."Have they not the right to ask forsuch clemency as comes when the claimsof both law and justice have been fullyliquidated?"As shepherds of a patient and suf-fering people, we ask amnesty for them,and pledge our faith and honor for theirfuture."And your petitioners will ever pray.Wilford Woodruff,George.

 ments may be free of the blood of all men, when the judgments of God overtake the wicked, as they will, and as they have overtaken the wicked in generations that are past and gone. Who else, I ask, does the God of Israel, do the heavenly hosts, look to to carry on this great and mighty work, but to you who are the sons and daughters of the men to whom He has revealed Him-self; you who, too, have entered into sacred covenants with Him; you who are the descendants of the noble men of old to whom God made great and glorious promises? And if you do not do your duty in these things, you will certainly come under con-demnation.Let me refer you to the testimony of Enoch as given to us in the Pearl of Great Price. Speaking of the disobedient who rejected the Gospel taught by Noah, Enoch says that"the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people and wept;" andEnoch bore record of it saying, "How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?" . . . The Lord said unto Enoch, "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their know-ledge in the day that I created them;and in the Garden of Eden gave I unto man his agency; and unto thy brethren have I said, and also gave commandments that they should love one another and that they should choose me their Father; but behold, they are without affection; and they hate their own blood; and the fire of mine indignation is kindled against them, . . . and among all the workmanship of my hands there has not been so great wickedness as among thy brethren; but behold,their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be theirfather; and misery shall be their doom; and the whole heavens shall weep over them." [##Moses 7:28-41##]You are today occupying the same position before heaven and before theearth, before God, angels, and men, you young men of Israel. Now can you afford to turn away from the commandments of God and allow satan to rule over you and be your father? Can you afford not to quali-fy yourselves for the great work that lies before you? You cannot. I am sorry to think that any of our young men should be found careless and indifferent to the responsibilityimposed upon them by the reason of their lineage and the covenants they are under. I would to God the eyes of our sons were open, all of them, so they could see themselves as God and our worthy progenitors behold us. I would to God you could all realize what is expected of you. I call upon parents throughout Zion to do what you can to induce your sons and daughters to walk in the paths of righteousness and truth and to improve the opportunities before them. Do not let your hearts be altogether upon the vanity and af-fairs of the world, but learn to ap-preciate the fact that faithful children are among the choicest and greatest of blessings.I used to meet with, instruct and bless the young Elders that were setapart from time to time to go on missions; I have made that a part of my business. I have now arrived at an age when I am obliged to leave off some duties I formerly performed, and that is one of them. As I can-not now be present with young mis-sionaries when they are set apart to go on missions, I want to say it here, so that when that call is made upon you, you will remember it when I am past and gone. There are two or three things that I want you to re-member, you that go upon missions, and all faithful Elders will be called on missions, for the harvest is great and the laborers are few compared with the necessity there is for such work in the four quarters of the earth to-day, to warn the world and preach the Gospel. One thing is, when you 
 go into a neighborhood to preachthe Gospel, never attempt to tear down a man's house, so to speak, before you build him a better one; never, in fact attack any one's re-ligion, wherever you go. Be willing to let every man enjoy his own re-ligion. It is his right to do that.  If he does not accept your testimony with regard to the Gospel of Christ, that is his affair, and not yours. Do not spend your time in pulling down other sects and parties. We haven't time to do that. It is never right to do that. When I have been abroad preaching I have found that people who were prepared to receive mytestimony believed in me, and in like manner they will receive the test-imony you have to give to them, if they can be touched with the Spirit of God. This is exemplified in the preaching of the Savior, which drew forth from Him this remark: "No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him."Another thing is: Wherever we go, sustain any and every govern-ment under heaven that sustains you.  Sustain all governments. Never be found antagonizing any government.  Government belongs to the people, and if it is not good for them, it is their business to rectify it, not yours.  I got into a position once that brought this to my mind very strongly; it occurred in my labors in the south of England. On my first mission to that country I went with Brother Kimball and Brother George A. Smith to London, and helped tobuild up the first branch of the Church that was organized there.  After returning home, I was again sent to England by President Young with Elder John Taylor and other brethren. It was customary for us to hold out-door meetings, as they are called; and while doing so, on one occasion, at London, one of ourbrethren referred to the English government in terms anything butcomplimentary to the people to whom it belonged, which, of course, wascontrary to the spirit of our calling and mission. It was brought to theattention of one of the chiefs of police, who came to me about it.  The same Elder had an appointment for the next Sabbath on the same ground. But before filling it I was careful to see that he was shown the unwisdom of pursuing such a course, also to see that wiser and more con-servative men did the preaching on that occasion. Had he been per-mitted to continue to indulge in such talk we would have brought  upon ourselves persecution, but by taking a wise and proper course, we received the protection of the police and govern-ment, and at last got permission to preach in churches, and were enabledto baptize thousands of church mem-bers; and we had as much freedom as we had in our own country. We learned afterwards that at this second meeting were two or three policemen in disguise who made a most favor-able report to the chief of police about us. Wherever we go we must always sustain the government that gives us protection. I wanted to mention and impress upon our young Elders these two things. It might not be out of place for me to say that we baptized the policeman that approached me, and he proved him-self to be a true and faithful Latter-day Saint.Now, I want to say to the Elders of Israel, young and old, there isnothing that we ought to labor more to obtain while in the flesh than theSpirit of God, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, which we are entitled to receive by reason of our having obeyed the requirements of the Gos-pel. When you get acquainted with the Spirit, follow its dictates, no mat-ter where it may lead you; and when you do that, it will become a princi-ple of revelation in you. I have al-ways found that a true principle in my whole life. If I had not followed that Spirit in my life, I would not be with you today. President Young told me, the first year of the settle- 
 ment of these valleys, to go to Bos-ton, and gather out all the Saints I could from the Middle Atlantic and New England States and the Canadas, who had been left there, and bring them up to Zion. I carried out his instructions to the best of my ability, and whenever I could get a company of a hundred men I would select some man and put him to preside over them, and send them on. I was the means of thus gathering toZion hundreds of people. I, myself, took the lead of the last company.  When we arrived at Pittsburg, just as we landed I was anxious to take a steamer and go on to St. Louis. I sought an interview with the captain just as he was starting out with some two hundred and twenty passengers on board. He expressed himself willing to take us on board, and I thought I would go; but just then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and said, "Don't go on board that steamer." That was enough. I knew the voice of the Spirit. I ex-cused myself to the captain and turned away. He immediately start-ed down the river. It was a dark night. Five miles below Pittsburg the steamer took fire. They had no chains on board, and there was hardly a soul on board that escapeddeath either from fire or water. There were with me in that company Leon-ard W. Hardy, Samuel Hardy and the Atwoods, who during their life-time were widely known. By hark-ening to the "still small voice" my company was saved, and I am spared to tell you about it today. I know by experience the value of it. Youyoung men should live in such a manner as to be entitled to the oper-ations of the Holy Ghost within you, and, as I have said, it will become a guide as well as a revelator to you, and never leave or fail you.I felt to say these few words to our young men of Israel. Zion is goingto be the glory of the whole earth, and all the purposes of God that you read of in the Bible and in the Book of Mormon in regard to the designs of God in the last days are going to be fulfilled to the very letter. And, as I said before, I say again, your future blessings, your future exalta-tion and glory, worlds without end, will depend upon the course you pur-sue here. The way is clear before you that leads to life eternal. It was found out by men whose voices are now hushed in death, and we have shown it to you; and it now remains for you to walk therein.Now, I would say to our superin-tendents here, continue your labor with the youth of Zion. Be not weary in your efforts to save the souls of men, for this is the work of your Heavenly Father. The boys whom you teach are the instruments whom the God of Heaven has called to bear off His Kingdom, and they will do it: yes, I repeat, they will do it; it is the will of God they should, and it is a pleasure for me to bear my testimony of these things to you at the age I have attained to.I want to say a word to our young sisters. When you receive an offer of marriage, find out whether the young man smokes, or drinks, or swears, or whether he goes to the Sabbath School, or Mutual Improve-ment Association, whether he is vir-tuous and worthy to bear the Priest-hood of the Son of God. A young woman had better be single all her days than to marry a man who dis-honors God and his parents, and is unworthy of the blessings which he is entitled to receive through the Gospel of Christ. You boys and girls have a great future before you.  There lies within your reach salva-tion, eternal life and a part in the first resurrection; in fact, all the bless-ings God has promised to any peo-ple that has ever been in the flesh, are held out to you and are within your reach inasmuch as you do your duty in these things.Before taking my seat, I want to ask the young men to study thescriptures; and to learn to understand 
 the signs of the times in which youlive. The signs of the second com-ing of the son of God are every-where seen, but the world does not comprehend them. The devil is abroad in the earth, and he will destroy every person that he can.  Search the scriptures that have come directly to us, as well as those con-tained in the Bible, and learn tocomprehend the mind and will of God, which we can do by reading them when the light of the Holy Spirit is within us, and thus prepare yourselves for that which will come to pass in life. My desire and my prayer for you and the youth of Zion is that you may rise up and magnify your calling and do yourduty, and accomplish all that God requires of you; which may God grant for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBYPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,At the General Conference, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Saturday, a.m., October 8th, 1881.REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.I want to preach a short sermonto this congregation. To begin with,I have heard President Young andPresident Taylor a great many timesfrom this stand ask the people tokeep quiet until the meeting wasdismissed; but as soon as the ser-mon ends there are a hundred boysand girls, or two hundred of them,rush for the doors. I do not like it.It pains me to see the President ofthe Church make this request andthe people pay no attention to it.Now, in this fast age we are pass-ing from a polite age to a very rudeone in many respects. When I wasa boy 65 years ago and went toschool, I never thought of passing aman whom I knew in the street, ora woman, without taking off myhat and making a bow. I neverthought of saying "yes" or "no" tothose that were placed over me. I was taught to say "yes, sir" and"no, sir;" but to-day it is "yes" and"no," "I will," "I won't," "I shall"and "I shan't." Now, when I seethis rudeness amongst us, I some-times wish that the spirit ofthe New England fatherswas more among the people,but I do hope, brethren, sisters andfriends, when a man stops talkingand the choir rises to sing, that youwill keep your seats. You can af-ford to do this as well as the Presi-dent of the Church, the TwelveApostles, or others who are sitting on this stand. You don't see usjump up and run for the door the moment a speaker is done. TheLord is displeased with any suchthing. I hope you will pardon mefor so speaking. I felt to say that much.We have a variety of teach-ing and preaching, and I havesometimes thought that we havemore preaching and teaching thanany other people on the earth. I expect it is all right. I think we need it.  The world need teaching, we ourselves need teaching; but I have thought that the Latter-daySaints have had more of the Gospelof Christ proclaimed to them thanany other generation that ever lived.My mind reverts to the channelsof communication from God to man.Here we have the Bible which givesa history and prophecy of the pro-phets from Adam down to our ownday extending through a period of near 6,000 years. The Lord, throughall the destruction that has taken place in the various libraries of the world—like the great library of Al-exandria, for example—has preserv-ed the record of the Jews, at least we have a portion of it to read. Then, again, we have the Book of Mormon, the stick of Joseph in thehands of Ephraim, giving a history of the ancient inhabitants of this country from the time of their leav-ing the Tower of Babel to their dis-appearance from the land, and of thevisitation of Christ to them. We have these books from which to ob-tain knowledge. Then we have the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, our Testament, which contains the most glorious, godlike, solemn and eter-nal truths ever recorded within thelids of a book on the earth. All theserecords are the words of God to man; and though the heavens and earth pass away not one jot or title will ever fall unfulfilled.Then the Lord has other ways of communicating His mind and will. We have the living oracles with us,and have had from the day that Joseph Smith received the ministra-tions of Moroni, the Nephite, John the Baptist, Peter, James and John, Moses, Elias, Elijah, Jesus Christ—from that day we have had the liv-ing oracles to teach us the word ofthe Lord.President Joseph F. Smith yester-day spoke of the gifts and graces.Now, the Lord has many ways in which He communicates with us. Freq[u]ently, as has been the case inevery age, truths, principles, warn-ings, etc., are communicat-ed to the children of men by means of dreams and visions.There is a great vision recorded in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. When Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith saw the visions of heaven they were commanded to write while in the vision. The Lord was in that. It is a communication to man. But we have had a great many dreams—I have had in mylife, and I suppose you have more or less—which amounts to nothing. I will tell you just about what I re-fer to. A man eats a hot supper and goes to bed; he gets the night-mare; he is chased by a bear; or hefalls over a precipice, and as soon ashe strikes the ground he wakes up. Now, the Lord had nothing to do with that. A man may go to bed half worried to death, tired anddream about something that will never take place. Last night, forinstance, I dreamt I was makingglass houses out of blocks of glass two feet square. Now, I don't knowthat the Lord was in that. Yet I have had dreams of a very differentcharacter. When I was a boy 11 years old, I had a very interesting dream, part of which was fulfilled to the very letter. In this dream I saw a great gulf, a place where allthe world had to enter at death, be-fore doing which they had to drop their worldly goods. I saw an agedman with a beaver hat and a broadcloth suit. The man lookedvery sorrowful. I saw him comewith something on his back, whichhe had to drop among the general pile before he could enterthe gulf. I was then but a boy. A few years after this my father and mother removed to Farmingtonand there I saw that man. I knewhim the moment I saw him. His name was Chauncy Deming. In afew years afterwards he was takensick and died. I attended his funer-al. He was what you may call a miser, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. When the coffin wasbeing lowered into the grave my dream came to me, and that nighthis son-in-law found one hundredthousand dollars in a cellar belong-ing to the old man. I name this merely to show that in this dream I had manifested to me certain things that were true. I think of all the inhabitants of the world having to leave their goods when they come to the grave. After this scene had passed before me I wasplaced in a great temple. It was called the kingdom of God. The first man that came to me was Un-cle Ozem Woodruff and his wife I helped into the temple. I assisted agreat many into that temple. Inprocess of time, after embracing the Gospel, and while on my first mis-sion to Tennessee, I told Bro. Pat-ten of my dream who told me thatin a few years I would meet that man and baptize him. That wasfulfilled to the very letter, for I af-terwards baptized my uncle and hiswife and some of the children; alsomy own father and step-mother andstep-sister, and a Methodist priest orclass-leader—in fact I baptized every-body in my father's house. I merelymention this to show—that dreams sometimes do come to pass in life.Then, again, there are visions. Paul you know, on one occasion was caught up to the third heaven and sawthings that were not lawful to utter.He did not know whether he wasIn the body or out of the body. That was a vision. When Joseph Smith,however, was visited by Moroni and the Apostles, it was not particularly a vision that he had; he talked withthem face to face.Now, I will refer to a thing that took place with me in Tennessee. I was in Tennessee in the year 1835, and while at the house of Abraham O. Smoot I received a letter fromBrothers Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, requesting me to staythere and stating that I would loseno blessing by doing so. Of course, I was satisfied. I went into a littleroom and sat down upon a small sofa. I was all my myself and theroom was dark; and while I rejoicedin this letter and the promise made to me, I became wrapped in vision.I was like Paul; I did not knowwhether I was in the body or out ofthe body. A personage appeared to me and showed me the greatscenes that should take place in thelast days. One scene after another passed before me. I saw the sun darkened; I saw the moon become as blood; I saw the stars fall from heaven; I saw seven golden lamps set in the heavens, representing thevarious dispensations of God to man—a sign that would appear before the coming of Christ. I saw the re-surrection of the dead. In the firstresurrection those that came forthfrom their graves seemed to be all dressed alike, but in the secondresurrection they were as di-verse in their dress as this congrega-tion is before me to-day, and if I had been an artist I could have painted the whole scene as it wasimpressed upon my mind, more in-delibly fixed than any thing I had ever seen with the natural eye. What does this mean? It was a testimony of the resurrection of the dead. I had a testimony. I believein the resurrection of the dead, and I know it is a true principle. Thus we may have dreams about thingsof great importance, and dreams of no importance at all. The Lord warned Joseph in a dream to takethe young child Jesus and His mother into Egypt, and thus Hewas saved from the wrath of Herod. Hence there are a great many things taught us in dreams that are true,and if a man has the spirit of God he can tell the difference between what is from the Lord and what is not. And I want to say to mybrethren and sisters, that whenever you have a dream that you feel is from the Lord, pay attention to it. When I was in the City of London on one occasion, with Brother GeorgeA. Smith, I dreamt that my wife came to me and told me that ourfirst child had died. I believed mydream, and in the morning whileat breakfast, I felt somewhat sad.Brother George A. noticed this and I told him my dream. Next morn-ing's post brought me a letter from my wife, conveying the intelligence of the death of my child. It may be asked what use there was in such a thing. I don't know thatthere was much use in it except toprepare my mind for the news of the death of my child. But what I wanted to say in regard to these matters is that the Lord doescommunicate some things of im-portance to the children of men bymeans of visions and dreams as wellas by the records of divine truth.And what is it all for? It is to teachus a principle. We may never see anything take place exactly as wesee it in a dream or a vision, yet is isintended to teach us a principle. My dream gave me a strong testi-mony of the resurrection. I am satisfied, always have been, in re-gard to the resurrection. I rejoicein it. The way was opened unto usby the blood of the Son of God.Now, having said so much on that subject,  I want to say to my breth-ren and sisters that we are placedupon the earth to build up Zion, tobuild up the kingdom of God. Thegreater proportion of the male mem-bers of Zion, who have arrived at the years of early manhood, bear some portion of the Holy Priest-hood. Here is a kingdom of Priestsraised up by the power of God to take hold and build up the kingdom of God. The same Priesthood existson the other side of the vail. Every man who is faithful in his quorumhere will join his quorum there.When a man dies and his body islaid in the tomb, he does not losehis position. The ProphetJoseph Smith held the keys of this dispensation on this sideof the vail, and he will hold them throughout the countless ages ofeternity. He went into the spirit world to unlock the prison doors and to preach the gospel to the millions of spirits who are in darkness, and every Apostle, every Seventy, everyElder, etc., that has died in thefaith as soon as he passes to the other side of the vail, enters intothe work of the ministry, and thereis a thousand times more to preachthere than there is here. I havefelt of late as if our brethren on theother side of the vail had held a council, and that they had said to this one, and that one, "Cease thywork on earth, come hence, we need help," and they have called this man and that man. It has appeared so to me in seeing the many menthat have been called from ourmidst lately. Perhaps I may be permitted to relate the circumstancewith which I am acquainted in re-gard to Bishop Roskelley, of Smith-field, Cache Valley. On one occa-sion he was suddenly taken verysick—near to death's door. Whilehe lay in this condition, PresidentPeter Maughan, who was dead,came to him and said: "Brother Roskelley, we held a council on the other side of the vail. I have had a great deal to do, and I have theprivilege of coming here to appoint one man to come and help. I have had three names given to me in council, and you are one of them. Iwant to inquire into your circum-stances." The Bishop told him what he had to do, and they con-versed together as one man wouldconverse with another. PresidentMaughan then said to him: "I thinkI will not call you. I think you arewanted here more than perhaps one of the others." Bishop Roskel-ly got well from that hour. Verysoon after, the second man wastaken sick, but not being able to ex-ercise sufficient faith, Brother Ros-kelley did not go to him. By and by this man recovered, and on meeting Brother Roskelley he said: "BrotherMaughan came to me the other night and told me he was sent tocall one man from the ward," and he named two men as had been done to Brother Roskelley. A few days afterwards the third man wastaken sick and died. Now, I name this to show a principle. They havework on the other side of the vail; and they want men, and they call them. And that was my view in regard to Brother George A. Smith. When he was almost a[t] death's door Brother Cannon administered tohim and in thirty minutes he was upand ate breakfast with his family. We labored with him in this way, but ultimately, as you know, he died. But it taught me a lesson. I felt that man was wanted behindthe vail. We labored also with Bro-ther Pratt; he, too, was wanted be-hind the vail.Now, my brethren and sisters,those of us who are left here have agreat work to do. We have been raised up of the Lord to take thiskingdom and bear it off. This is our duty; but if we neglect our duty andset our hearts upon the things ofthis world, we will be sorry for it.We ought to understand the respon-sibility that rests upon us. We should gird up our loins and put onthe whole armor of God. We shouldrear temples to the name of the Most High God, that we may redeem the dead.I feel to bear my testimony to thiswork. It is the work of God.  Jo-seph Smith was appointed by thethe Lord before he was born as much as Jeremiah was. The Lordtold Jeremiah—"Before I formedthee in the belly I knew thee; andbefore thou camest forth out of thewomb I sanctified thee, and I or-dained thee a Prophet unto the na-tions." He was commanded towarn the inhabitants of Jerusalem of their wickedness. He felt it ahard task, but ultimately he did ashe was commanded. So I say with regard to Joseph Smith. He receiv-ed his appointment from before the foundation of the world, and he came forth in the due time of theLord to establish this work on the earth. And so it is the case withtens of thousands of the Elders of Israel. The Lord Almighty hasconferred upon you the Holy Priest-hood and made you the instrument in His hands to build up this king-dom, Do we contemplate these things as fully as we ought? Dowe realize that the eyes of all the heavely hosts are over us? Then let us do our duty. Let us keep thecommandments of God, let us befaithful to the end, so that when wego into the spirit world and lookback upon our history we may be satisfied.  The Lord Almighty hasset his hand to establish His kingdom never more to be thrown down or given to another people, and, therefore, all the pow-ers of earth and hell combined will never be able to stay the progress of this work. The Lord has said he will break in pieces every weapon that is raised against Zion, and thenations of the earth, the Kings and Emperors, Presidents and Gover-nors have got to learn this fact. It is a fearful thing to fall into thehands of the Lord. It is a fearful thing to shed the blood of the Lord's anointed. It has cost the Jews 1800 years of persecution, and this gene-ration have also a bill to pay in this respect.I bear my testimony to thesethings. The Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Book of Doctrine and Covenants contain the words of eternal life unto this generation, and they will rise in judgment againstthose who reject them.May God bless this people andhelp us to magnify our callings, for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.We have lying before us the earth-ly tabernacle of President Brigham Young. His voice is hushed in death, and all Israel has to bow and submit to the mind and will of God. Israel will never again hear his voice until after the resurrection. I have no desire to occupy the time of this assembly, in eulogizing the life of President Young. His works and words are recorded in heaven, and they are recorded here on the earth; and that is sufficient. Let those of us who remain a few days study the counsels, the ser-mons and principles which have been revealed unto us through the mouth of this prophet of God. It will be but a few days until a great many of us who are in this assemb-ly will follow him.It seems as though Joseph was with anxious to have him, on the other side of the vail, almost all the men that labored with him and stood shoulder to shoulder with him in the flesh. I do no suppose there was ever a man breathed the breath of life who, in the short space of forty-five years, has done so muchtowards the establishment of thegovernment and kingdom of God, as our beloved President. His life has been before many of you for several years, and to some from the commencement of his labors in this church. He felt the weight of this dispensation resting upon him; he certainly has been true and faithful unto death, and he is prepared to receive a crown of life.About all I wish to do in my re-marks is to exhort this great bodyof people who hold the holy priest-hood, that during the few remain-ing days of our earthly life we con-tinue, faithfully, the work that is now left us to do. "The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." The great desire of President Young in the last year of his life, as well as previously, was that before he passed away hemight erect Temples to the name of the Lord, in that way and man-ner that men bearing the holy priesthood in the flesh could enter into those temples and perform their missions, for the redemption of the dead. This has been plainlymanifested to all who have been much in his company. I rejoice that he lived long enough to enterinto one Temple and attend to itsdedication, and to commence the work of others. And I would say to this people, let us go to andfinish these Temples, that we may continue the work required of us. I trust we will realize the import-ance of the great and serious res-ponsibilities resting upon us who are engaged in the work which comprehends all others; it being the great and last dispensation of the fulness of times; that we, like ourleader, may be diligent, day and night, in striving to carry out the counsels given to us.I feel to thank God in my spiritthat our beloved President has had the privilege, when his work was finished, of laying down his body in peace, at home, surrounded by his family and friends; instead of suffering martyrdom as did our for-mer President, and as did nearly all of the ancient Apostles. This to me is certainly very consoling. And I would repeat, Let us accom-plish the work laid upon us by our beloved leader, so that when our time is ended, we can go hence and be welcomed into the society of Brigham, of Joseph, George A., Brother Kimball and the host of Elders who have dwelt in the flesh and proven faithful and true, feel-ing satisfied with our labors.It is said that "blessings brighten as they take their flight." I have ofter felt in listening to the gloriousprinciples of President Young, that the people here heard him so much that they hardly prized the beautyand the extent of the results and virtues of his teachings. Brethrenlet us give these things our serious attention and remember them and carry them out in our lives. Let us keep the commandments, striv-ing in all earnestness to be true and faithful to the end of our work,so that we may share the joys of those men whose names brighten the pages of our history.I would say to the bereaved fam-ily, may God comfort you and bless you and give you increasedly of his Spirit. Your husband and fa-ther has gone to prepare the way for his family who must sooner or later follow after him. If you, as his wives, his sons and daughters keep his sayings, you will be pre-pared to meet him in the morning of the resurrection, numbered among the faithful and worth ones. And to my brethren and sisters who have heard his voicefor these many years: Let us not forget the precious words of truthand wisdom he has taught us. Weare living in a time of important changes. If ever a man could have been saved from dying through prayer, President Brigham Young could. But it was not in the powerof man to keep him here. I believeBro. Geo. A. Smith was kept fromdying through the prayers of his brethren and the saints, several months after he was called away. But when the Lord calls we mustgo. When we received word in St. George of the sickness of PresidentYoung, we stopped all business, andwent into the Temple remaining mostly for two days and nights en-gaged in supplicating Almight God for his recovery, until the timeof his death. Having finished hiswork he had to go; and he is nowbeyond the power of pain and sor-row, sickness and death. He has been true and faithful to the end,and therefore all is well with him.That God may bless us all, and help us to realize the responsibility we are under to him, to our fellow-man and to each other, to the liv-ing and to the dead, is my prayerin the name of Jesus. Amen. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.O God, our Eternal Father, wepresent ourselves before thee, in thename of Jesus Christ, to say thatwe have committed to this tombthe tabernacle of they servant Pres-ident Brigham Young, and beforeclosing our labors and services andduties towards him, we wish to ded-icate unto thee this vault, with allits contents and surroundings. Inthe name of the Lord Jesus Christ,and by authority of the holy priesthood and apostleship, we dedicatethis ground and this vault with allthe materials of which it is com-posed, that it may be holy unto theLord our God. We dedicate thiscoffin, and the box which containsit, that it may be holy unto theLord our God. We also dedicatethe body itself, the tabernacle ofthy servant, unto the Lord ourGod, that it may be holy unto thee.And we pray in the name of JesusChrist that this body may sleephere in peace a few days, untilthe time shall come when by thepower of God and the keys of theresurrection, it shall come forthclothed with glory, immortalityand eternal lives, with crowns,kingdoms, principalities and pow-ers, as they have been and will beappointed unto him. Yes, our Fa-ther, this same tabernacle, whichhas borne the burden and heat ofthe day, which has borne testi-mony through its life of the estab-lishment of the kingdom of God,preached the gospel of Christ andperformed its work faithfully, thismortal body which has sufferedpain and sickness, persecution anddeath, may then arise in glory andpower to attain to its throne, cloth-ed in glory and immortality, inconnection with Abraham, Isaacand Jacob and the prophets, andall the holy men who shall thenjudge the inhabitants of the earth,even those who have lived in hisday and generation, to whom hehas been faithful in bearing testi-mony of they word and work.All these things, our Father, wededicate to thee and thy safe keep-ing in the name of Jesus Christ, andpray that we, with him, may beprepared in the morning of thefirst resurrection, and that we maybe with him in the family organiz-ation that shall be organized in thecelestial world, and that we maybe prepared to receive those keysand blessings which have beenpromised through the priesthoodand gospel of the Son of God. Wededicate all pertaining unto thisplace, this burial ground and all itssurroundings unto the Lord ourGod.We thank thee, our Father, thatthou has revealed unto us thatpower and principle of the resur-rection by which the pain, thesting and power of death are alltaken away.  For all these things,our Father, we praise thee; andpray that this dedication, in all itsparts, may be acceptable in thysight, and that these blessings mayrest down upon the family, thewives, sons and daughters of thyservant Brigham, which merciesand favors we ask, dedicating allunto thee, in the name of JesusChrist, our Redeemer. Amen.

 Councilor Woodruff, chairman ofcommittee on claims and appro-priations, presented the followingreport, which was read:Gentlement: Your committee onclaims and appropriations, to whomwas referred the claim of HarrisonEdwards for alleged "services invisiting public prisons," respecttul-ly report that we find no statute ofthe Territory, requiring such ser-vice or providing for its payment,and therefore recommend that pe-titioner have leave to withdraw hispetition. Respectfully,WILFORD WOODRUFF,Chairman.February 7th, 1876. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said that thethings of the world are of little conse-quence to us without salvation. He was glad to find so many of the Saintshere whom he had seen in distantcountries beyond the seas. We arenow where we can have peace, worshipthe Lord and enjoy ourselves in security.It requires the Spirit of God to enableus to properly appreciate our blessings.Those that have that Spirit can see thekingdom of God in the latter times.There is no greater work in which aman can feel interest than this work inwhich we are engaged. We ought tobe rich in the treasures of knowledgeand understanding. The Lord ownsand blesses this people. If a manwants to look at miracles, he may see them inthe establishment and preservation ofthis church. We live in a fast age, andthe Lord is doing a great work in ourday. The wicked say Let Zion be de-filed. This is the feeling of theenemies of truth, but they do not under-stand the counsel of the Lord: we do.We come to visit you and comfort you.We have left our labor at home to takecare of itself, and we are glad to see thepeople spend an hour or two to come tomeeting. Let us do right and God willbe our friend. Jacob is but small, buthe will rise, the little one become amighty people and the small one astrong nation. Make yourselves a goodtown here, and plant orchards and vineyards. Let your deed be accepta-ble before God and you will always behappy. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFNext arose and said as the funeral serviceson this occasion not only em-braced the death of Brother DavidHoagland Cannon, whose tabernaclenow laid before the congregation, buta great many other Elders whohad yielded up their lives whilepreaching the Gospel to the nations ofthe earth, an endeavor had been madeto publish these cases as far as theyhad come to the knowledge of theauthorities, and Apostle Richardswould therefore read to those assembledthe list already furnished.  After thisBrother Grant wold read one of thelast letters written home from abroadby the late David H. Cannon 
 385Remarks By Elder Wilford Woodruff,delivered in the Tab-ernacle, Great Salt Lake City, May 19th, 1867.[Reported by David W. Evans.]386 - 387I also am a missionary, and I always considered it a great honor to be one. I received a mission when I embraced this work; it has never been taken from me yet. In company with a number of the brethren I have just returned, as br. Taylor has said, from visiting our brethren in the south. We have had an excellent time. We have been over a great many rough roads, traveled hard, and have preached from once to three times every day. We have been taught, instructed, and edified; at least I have a great deal. We have had a good time in visiting the Saints, and as President B. Young remarked in some of his discourses, we have been able to draw the contrast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world. My own experience enabled me to bring that subject home very readily, and I presume it is so with most of the Elders who have been on missions preaching the gospel. I have travelled a great many thousands of miles to preach the gospel without purse or scrip, with my knapsack on my back, and begging my bread from door to door. I have done many things that all the gold in California would not have hired me to do except for the gospel. My natural feelings would forbid me travelling through the world asking for my bread from door to door; I would much sooner labor for it.387We have been called to preach the gospel; the Lord Almighty has required it at our hands; we would have been under condemnation as Elders if we had not done it. We have done it, and our garments, in a great measure, are clear of the blood of this generation. For over thirty years we have labored to preach the gospel; and we have gathered together a people to these valleys of the mountains, with whom I rejoice to meet. I once asked the Lord to let me go and preach the gospel. I had a desire to preach the gospel in its beauty, plainness, and glory, and to show the worth of the principles it contained. I felt that they were of as much value to my fellow men as to me. The Lord gave me the privilege I asked for, and I believe that I have preached to the nations of the earth as much as I desire; if duty should not require it, I never wish to go and preach to the world again. I have had my day and time at it; still, if called to go, I presume I should go as I have always done. But I do enjoy the society of the Saints, I love home, and I love to travel through these settlements, and to see the boys, the girls, the men, and the women parading the streets to welcome the President and his brethren; and, on our return here, to meet with greetings from ten thousand Saints brought peculiar meditations to my mind. It brought home very forcibly the contrast between preaching to the Saints and preaching to the world.387QZ1In my early missions, when preaching in the Southern States—Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky—I have waded swamps and rivers and have walked seventy miles or more without eating. In those days we counted it a blessing to go into a place where there was a Latter-day Saint. I went once 150 miles to see one; and when I got there he had apostatized, and tried to kill me. Then, after travelling seventy-two miles without food, I sat down to eat my meal with a Missouri mobocrat, and he damning and cursing me all the time. That is the nature of the Southern people—they would invite you to eat with them if they were going to cut your throat. In those days we might travel hundreds and hundreds of miles and you could not find a Latter-day Saint, but now, thank God, we have the privilege of travelling hundreds and hundreds of miles where we can find but little else. I regard this as a great blessing.387 - 388Our missionaries are going abroad under different circumstances from what we went. We had no Zion, no Utah, no body of Saints to give us any assistance. We were commanded to go without purse or scrip, and we had to do it. We trusted in the Lord, and he fed us. We found friends, built up churches, and gathered out the honest and meek of the earth. Times have changed since then. These brethren are going to the nations of the earth where starvation stares many of the people in the face, and where it is hard for millions to obtain the necessaries of life. The people here are wealthy, and it is no more than right that we should impart of our substance to help those who are going on missions. I hope the brethren and sisters will help liberally, and will impart sufficient to send the brethren to their several fields of labor.388I rejoice in the gospel of Christ; I rejoice in the principles that have been revealed for our salvation, exaltation, and glory. I rejoice in the establishment of the work in these mountains, and in our southern settlements. As has been already said, the Lord has blessed our brethren there. It is a miracle to see those settlements when we consider what the country was such a short time since. The city of St. George is second to none in the Territory unless it be Great Salt City; and I doubt the latter being equal to St. George, when we take into consideration the population of the two places. They have better buildings and improvements there, according to numbers, than we have here. At Toquerville, too, they are laying fine foundations for stone and brick buildings, and they are improving all through the southern settlements. The soil there is so sandy that it looks as if it would require two men to hold it together long enough for a hill of corn to grow. Like the waves of the sea, it is ever on the move. It contains, too, a good deal of mineral which destroys the vegetation and everything with which it comes in contact. Some of the brethren have spent as much as two thousand dollars to render an acre of land productive; now they have fine gardens and vineyards growing, and, strange to say, though the country naturally looks like a desolate, barren, sandy, unfruitful desert, still the cattle are fat, all kinds of stock look well, and everything was green and flourishing in the settlements as we passed through them. The whole of that mission at its commencement presented a most forbidding aspect, and really had so many discouraging features that men were compelled to work by faith and not by sight. Now, however, the soil is blessed, the climate is delightful, and plenty and prosperity attend the labors of the people. To show you the difference of the climate in the country, and of the district of country a few miles this side of it, I need only mention that the morning we left Beaver there was ice along the creeks, but when we got to Toquerville, two days' travel further south, we found the apricots half grown, the peaches as large as peas, the cotton-wood trees green and in full leaf, altogether looking like another country. It is a different climate altogether from what it is in these higher places.388The hand of God is in all the operations we are trying to carry out. We have to build up Zion independent of the wicked; we have got to become self-sustaining, and the Lord is inspiring His prophets to preach to us to lay the foundation for the accomplishment of this work. The day is not far distant when we shall have to take care of ourselves. Great Babylon is going to fall, judgment is coming on the wicked, the Lord is about to pour upon the nations of the earth the great calamities which He has spoken of by the mouths of His prophets; and no power can stay these things. It is wisdom that we should lay the foundation to provide for ourselves.388 - 389QZ2With regard to the Word of Wisdom, I must say I was agreeably surprised to see how generally the people are taking hold of it. We did not see much coffee or tea, and I do not think that one in the company drank a drop of it. I rejoice in this; it is going to make the people more wealthy, it will save us a great deal of means, besides preventing our being poisoned to death, for these things are poisoned, and the Lord understood that when He gave the Word of Wisdom many years ago. The people are improving in a great many things. There is a very good spirit and feeling among them, and the feeling to carry out the purposes of God is general.389I rejoice in this work because it is true, because it is the plan of salvation, the eternal law of God that has been revealed to us, and the building up of Zion is what we are called to perform. I think we have done very well considering our traditions and all the difficulties which we have had to encounter; and I look forward, by faith, if I live a few years, to the time when this people will accomplish that which the Lord expects them to do. If we do not, our children will. Zion has got to be built up, the Kingdom of God has got to be established, and the principles revealed to us have to be enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints. There is no principle that God has revealed but what has salvation in it, and we, in order to be saved, must observe His laws and ordinances. Where is there a man or woman who does not wish to be saved? All wish to be saved; all desire salvation, and to enjoy those blessings which they were created to enjoy. The gospel has been offered to this generation for the purpose of saving them in the Kingdom of God if they will receive it. I rejoice in all the principles revealed to us, and the more I see, hear, and learn, the more I am satisfied of the importance of the revelations that God has given to us. As President Young remarked in one of his sermons south, "Whatever the Lord reveals to this or any other people does not ignore anything revealed before." No part of the gospel is superfluous. It is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, and all the inhabitants of this world and all others have got to be saved by it, if saved at all. It is necessary, therefore, that we receive and obey all of its principles. When the first principles of the gospel were revealed to us we rejoiced in them. After them we had other principles revealed, the principle of baptism for the dead, for instance. We did not know anything of that until about the year 1840, on our return from England. I rejoice in that principle. It is a great blessing that there can be saviors on Mount Zion. It is a glorious principle that we can go forth and erect temples and attend to ordinances for the living and the dead; that we can redeem our forefathers and progenitors from among the spirits in prison. They will be preached to in prison by those spirits on the other side of the vail who hold the keys of the Kingdom of God, and we will have the privilege of attending to ordinances in the flesh for them. Then, again, the blessing that God has revealed to us in the patriarchal order of marriage—being sealed for time and eternity—is not prized by us as it should be. When that principle was revealed, the prophet told the brethren that this kingdom could not advance any further without it; "and," said he, "if you do not receive it you will be damned saith the Lord." You may think this very strange, but the Lord never reveals anything that He does not require to be honored.389 - 390What would have been our position if this had not been revealed? This principle is plain, clear, and interesting; without it not a man in this Church could have either wife or child sealed to him for eternity, for all our marriage covenants before were only for time, and we, as a Church, had arrived at that point when, in order to insure a full salvation, it was necessary to reveal this principle. It is a great blessing to us. We love our wives and children, and wish to enjoy their society, but the thought of separation would mar all the happiness that the Saints might otherwise attain. The Saint who aspires to salvation and glory wants a continuation of family ties and associations after death. Without this principle we were like the rest of the world—without any such hope. From the day the apostles were slain until the Lord revealed this principle in the last days, not a man ever dwelt in the flesh who had wife or child sealed to him for eternity, so that he could enjoy their society in the resurrection. That was just our position before this ordinance was revealed, but now, whether we have one wife, two, three, or as many as the Lord sees fit to bestow upon us, when we come forth from the grave our families remain with us in the eternal world. So it is with every principle the Lord reveals—it is good for His people in time and eternity.390Brethren and sisters, QZ3let us be faithful, and look at the promises of God as they are contained in the gospel of Christ, and never treat lightly any principle, no matter what it is, whether it be faith, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the resurrection of the dead, eternal judgments, the marriage covenant, baptism for the dead, or any other ordinance that the Lord has revealed; they all belong to the kingdom, are necessary to salvation, and the responsibility of carrying them out rests upon this people. We know that the world looks with contempt upon us and upon the institutions of the kingdom of God. They do not object to institutions that are corrupt and ungodly. The world is flooded to-day with evil and wickedness, and the earth groans under it. But because we as a people follow the example of Abraham, in taking more wives than one, we are universally decried and despised. The Christian world profess to believe in Abraham, and he, through obedience to the command of God in this respect, was called the "Father of the faithful," and the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem will each be named after one of the twelve patriarchs, his descendants, and the sons of a polygamist, and fathers of all Israel. Even the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came to lay down his life to redeem the world, was through the same lineage. He was of Judah; He was the King of the Jews and the Savior of the world.390These principles are as righteous to-day as in any other age of the world when governed and controlled by the commandments of God. Let us prize all the principles, revelations, and blessings that God has revealed to us; let us treasure them up, do our duty to God, to one another, and our fellow men.QZ4No man has any time to sin, to steal, swear, or break any of the laws of God if he wishes to secure a full and complete salvation; but we must all do the best we can, laboring with all our might to overcome every evil, for it will take a whole life of faithfulness and integrity for any Saint of God to receive a full salvation in the presence of God.390May God bless us, and give us His spirit, and wisdom to guide and direct us into all truth, for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 APOSTLE WOODRUFFfelt moved upon to speak a fewwords to the Conference, by bearing his testimony to what John had justfinished saying, as also to what Can-non had promulgated as Gospel inthe forenoon, for they were oracles ofGod, and it was not the privilege ofone man alone to have revelation, butit was the duty of all the Saints to befull of revelation, so that they might walk through life with the light ofthe Holy Spirit shining on their path.It was the duty of those who shoulcharter ships for the emigration of theSaints to have it; it was the duty ofBrother John D. T. McAllister, tobe filled with the spirit of revelationevery day in the St. George Temple,so that he could prevent any manfrom robbing another of his deadwives. The Prophet Joe Smith bap-tized thousands before he kept anyrecord of the baptisms. But he didnot know it all. For twenty yearsthe endowments had been given in a little house in the Temple book, butthe whole light had not been revealedthen. Only after the St. George Temple was completed did the Lordlet the priesthood intoTHE WHOLE SECRET.The he showed the Prophet Brigham many new things, as alsothe preacher, Woodruff. There wereabout twenty men and twenty womenadministering the holy ordinance inthe St. George temple, all for no-thing and boarding themselves. Farbe it from the Apostles to make mer-chandies of the gifts and blessings ofGod, but the brethren and sistersmust live by eating, and thereforethe many who are intending to gothrough the temple from this timeforward, must take along their tem-ple offerings to lay upon the altar.As to [bing], take hold and go to,now, said the preacher, and pay what you owe.THERE'S MILLIONS IN IT!Your dead will be after you intones of ten thousands thunders if youdon't, because they are interested inthis great work. And now, our sis-ters, God bless them forever, saidWilford, let them go too and lay upthe wheat while it is cheap, for thegreat famine which is coming uponthe world. "Somehow or 'nother,the brethring have got an idle intheir heads, that there ain't agoin' tobe no famine, but there is; the Lordhas said so, and the Lord don't lie,for he's agoin' to pour out the [le]of his wrath upon the wicked, andspread war and contention among the nations of the earth with fire and sword and pestilence and famine onevery band, and lay up your wheat,brethring. Plant out mulberryfields instead of these pasty,rotten cottonwoods, and use 'emtoo, and latch to the counsels of theholy priesthood, and manufacturedeverything we need so that if theLatter-day Saints are cut off fromthe rest of the world they can be in-dependent, for Babylon is going tofall; the Lord has said so, andTHE LORD DON'T LIE,and support our own publicationsespecially the Woman's Exponent forthe sixtera on it are doing a noblework." Here the Apostle caught his breath and subsided. 
 THE CHURCH DEBT.The venerable president of the churchrose at the close of Elder Teasdale'sremarks, saying, "I have felt it myduty to speak of a subject that hasbeen brought up here to-day, and thatis the debts of the church. Person-ally, I never run into debt myself. Imade that a rule from my boyhood up,but since I have been in the church inthis valley I have certainly deviated along way from that principle. I thinkit my duty to tell you how I came indebt as president of the church andtrustee of a trust. It is well knownhow the United States Governmenttook possession of all of the propertyof the church. Receivers were sent toUtah, one of whom I will mention.His name was Dyer. He came to meand demanded all of the personalproperty of the church. He demanded$500,000 in money, believeing we oughtto have that much. We did not havethat much money, or anything of thekind; had never had it. President Tay-lor had given to the different stakes inUtah for the support of the poor,wheat and vegetables, and other storeswhich in all the Territory amounted to about $150,000. Mr. Dyer gatheredup these accounts and wanted moneyfor all that. As a compromise, ratherthan have lawsuits brought against usin every stake of Zion, we agreed topay him $75,000, and did so. Thenwherever he could find a sale of land,or money expended and paid out, orany other expense the church had goneto, he demanded it of us.Rather than have lawsuit after law-suit, we agreed to give him this money.It amounted to about a half million ofdollars. We had never had that muchmoney. It was money we had paid outand given away; but we went to thebanks and borrowed $500,000 and gaveit to him. We gave our notes for itand that was the beginning of ourdebts. We have had to pay rent forour own church property. When a por-tion of our money was restored to us,we had the blessed privilege of takingup a portion of our notes. The moneywas about $100,000 short, that amounthaving been spent by the receivers.We are still in debt, however.President Woodruff thought themembers of the church were doingwrong in not supporting their poorand paying their own way. The peo-ple, he thought, ought to do more thanthey were doing and take the burdenoff of the church. He was satisfied thechurch wanted to get out of debt, andif the various wards and stakes wouldkeep up their tithing and fast offeringsit would help a great deal. The presi-dency wanted to help all it could, andwould do so, but it could not respondto all that asked. In conclusion, Pres-ident Woodruff was thankful that theUnited States Government had done sowell in restoring their property, and hefelt confiedent that the Governmentwould yet return the real estate of thechurch. 
 LETTER FROM ELDER WOODRUFF.FARMINGTON, Connecticut, March 21, 1846.To the Saints scattered abroad through the Eastern Churches.DEAR BRETHREN: Having just returned from Liverpool to the United States, for the purpose of gathering my family andkindred with the Saints west of the Mountains, and feeling adeep interest in the welfare of the Saints at large, I have madeenquiries concerning the prospects, intentions and presidencyof the eastern churches, and was informed that Elder Littlewas appointed to take the Presidency of the eastern churches, charter ships for their emigration, &c. I have since had an interview with Elder Little, and have seen his appointment bythe Quorum of the Twelve in Nauvoo, and I feel heartily to re-commend the appointment to all the Saints, and I greatly de-sire that all will unite as the heart of one man, in sustaininghim in all his operations and labors, and especially in the char-tering of ships for emigration. The Saints will find it much to their advantage to be entirely united in their movements inthe emigration. I hope and trust the day is not far distant,when all the Saints in these eastern lands, may be making pre-parations to gather with the main body, either by sea or land.Those who go by water, will go with less expense, and be ena-bled to take much more with them than they could by land.That peace, union, and the blessing of God, may rest uponyou, and that you may be gathered together and build up Zion,is the prayer of your brother in the covenant and faith of theGospel of Jesus Christ.WILFORD WOODRUFF. 
 Great Salt Lake CityDec. 1, 1862.Hon. J. M. BernhiselDear SirI have received your letter of Sept. 27 concerningyour business. I have delayed writing until the present, hopingto be able to settle it. I have spoken to Bollwinkel & Brockbankto day, they promised to settle soon; but Bollwinkel refusesto pay any interest.Concerning Abraham Taylor, he wishes me togive up the note and take the property that is mortgaged,but he does not wish to pay any thing more on the note, he toldme he had given you a deed in addition to the mortgage, whichI think is not correct, as there is no deed on record. What I wishnow to know is, whether I shall give up the note and take a deed of the property that is mortgaged, or foreclose the mortgage,sell the property and indorse the amount received on the note;if so please send me a regular power of attorney & necessary papers.Respectfully your &cW Woodruff

 G. S. L. City,Mar. 31, 1864.Hon. J. F. Kinney:Yours of the 9th inst., advising us ofyour return from mailing under brass lock a large quantityof seeds for distribution is received; together with aquantity of franked labels for which please accept ourgratitude. There never was a time in Utah whenseeds were more valuable and desirable than at thepresent time. Seeds heretofore have been on our Gardener'shands a drag, but this season before our citizens wereaware the strangers in our midst emptied the feed storesearly, and when the citizens began to enquire for seeds therewas not a pea, an onion seed, nor a top onion to befound except they were willing to pay fabulous pricesfor them.The Historian's Office, Bro. Geo. A. and myself& no doubt the others named have received their seeds.After the receipt of your 2 sacks containingAgricultural Reports & McLellan's Report, the historicalcorps spent the day addressing and carrying to the P. officeaccording to your directions. We also kept an alphabeticalaccount of names addressed to Bro. Geo. A. assistedme in this matter, and in fact his memory, whichever retains a lively remembrance of all our enterprizingand philanthrophic citizens, was taxed to its utmost tensionthat no distinguished citizen was passed; and that ourdistribution might savor of as little invidiousness as possible7 p.m. I have just received per mail a sack of seeds 
 G. S. L. City, June 8, [18]61.To the Mayor and City Councilof Payson: An Act approved Jan. 18,1861, confers upon our Honorable body the rightto control the waters of Spring creek for the useand benefit of the citizens of Payson. We beg leaverespectfully to crave your special care over the Gardensand nurseries located at Spring Lake villa, as the seeds, roots, bulbs, plants, and trees there in cultivationare iof immense value to the city of Payson inparticular and the Territory of Utah in general.In our humble judgment the said Gar-dens are entitled to far more consideration than anyordinary farm crops, and should not be placed,by any means, on a level with them in their propor-tion of water. I have heard that the John-sons put on airs and treated the Council ofPayson with indignity and disrespect. If thisbe so, have the goodness as fathers to wave the in-dignity and have a fatherly eye to the generalwelfare of the commonwealth. Excuse our in-terference in your municipal affairs, it is froma zeal to promote agricultural, horticultural,Pomological, Floracultural interests in Utah County

 Elder Wilford WoodruffDear and respected BrotherI received your very welcome letter by last evening's mail, and wasmuch pleased on seeing it. Hitherto, letters were addressed to W. W. Cluffthe President of the Stake, about the Seventies, and the Pioneers—and the firstI knew of them, was by reading them in the Priesthood meetings—I receivedone in Geo. Goddard's writing, about the banners, and I answered him to the bestof my knowledge. I addressed all to him, knowing he would faithfullydistribute them to the proper persons.But your letter to me, gave me as much pleasure, as I fancy youenjoyed, when the angel first appeared to you, to give you the necessary informationto superintend the ordinances for the living and the dead.This morning I went over to bro. Williams, to arrange to give a ton of coalto the first man with a Horse team, who will carry me, banner & to Salt Lake City.George Goddard being in the Bishop's Office, may know of a Horse team coming out here,on Monday 19th for a load of coal on tithing who will take me with him to the city,and he will get his ton of coal, at the Mine, without costing him any thing.I have also got the first Buckskin Coat made in the Valley in August 1847which I will bring in, as a contrast to the clothing of 1880, that will require a straight stick6 or 7 feet long, with a cross piece for the arms. If the Painters would print a slip"the first coat made by the Pioneers, in Salt Lake Valley, August 1847," to paste on the Coat,will preach a service in a very few words.I shall esteem [ink blot] pleasure and a privilege, to ride in the same Waggon with you.The banner "crossing the Platte river" was got up by donation. If it is not found in thetithing panary, or the book binder's garret: it was 2 or 3 times put up in the garret of theCouncil House, over T. O. Angel's room. Joseph Scofield being dead, I supposed T.

Perhaps John Kelly, the bookbinder can tell you.I would like to call the roll to find out who are present, and where living, and anyinformation about the others, and then make a copy for you.Praying that your life may be spared, to continue your good labors, in assisting others toperform the ordiances for the dead, and prepare for the second coming of our SaviorI remain yours obediently, & brother in the new and everlasting CovenantThomas Bullock Coalville July 11, 1880over

 G. S. L. City, March 30, 1864.Bishop Thomas Callister:Elder W. Woodruff has received from bro.Ashman several letters and a telegram in relation tothe disgraceful charges preferred against Orlando Warner,concerning which bro. Geo. A. has also received a letter fromyou. So far as we can learn the excitement againstJudge King is in consequence of his having admittedWarner to bail, and whether the Judge accepted an illegalbond or admitted Warner on his own recognisance hasnot transpired. That Judge King would have theright to admit Warner to bail to a regular termof court by taking ample security is established byprecedent. The bail would necessarily have to be highbecause in chap. 22, Sec. 16, of laws of Utah the pun-ishment for such a crime is imprisonment for life ornot less than ten years. We would regard a bondfor $3000.00 executed in proper form, conditioned forthe peaceful demeanor of the accused as well as hisappearance at court to answer as sufficient. Art. 4 ofthe amendments to the Constitution says: Excessive bailshall not be required.

 WILFORD WOODRUFFHISTORIAN'S OFFICE.March 28, 1887.Elder Heber J. GrantDear Brother:You asked me a question the last timewe met ehich I was not prepared to answer at the time it was given.I have gibven the subject some thought and reflection and I now feelprepared to answer the question according to my views. You askedme if I knew any reason in case of the death of the President ofthe Church why the Twelve Apostles should not choose some otherperson to be the President of the Church instead of the TwelvePresident of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know of several goodsound reasons which I will now give you. In the first place thereare two or three plain truths which are eternal, everlasting, un-changeable, and immovable as the pillars of heaven (as far asthis dispensation is concerned) which have been established by therevelation of God through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith.These truths stare us in the face. First, when the President ofthe Church dies, who then is the presiding authority of the Church?It is the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (ordained and organized bythe revelations of God and none else). Then while these TwelveApostles preside over the Church, who is the President of the Church[?]It is the President of the Twelve Apostles. And he is virtually asmuch the President of the Church while presiding over Twelve men ashe is when organized into the Presidency of the Church and presid-ing over two men. And this principle has been carried out now for57 years, ever since the organization of the Church. When JosephSmith the Prophet was martyred, the Twelve Apostles stepped forthas the presiding authority of the Church, as ordained of God, withBrigham Young at their head to preside over the Church and directits affairs. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize theFirst Presidency, which of the Twelve stepped forth to claim theright to preside over Brigham Young? Not one, nor any other manexcept Sidney Rigdon, an apostate. Why did Brigham Young claim theright of the Presidency? Because he was the President of theChurch while presiding over Twelve men as two men. When PresidentYoung died who was the presiding authority of the Church? TheTwelve Apostles and none else. And who was the President of the Church? John Taylor. Why? Because he was the President of theTwelve Apostles. And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize theFirst Presidency again, which of the Twelve Apostles was moved uponto claim the right to preside over the Church above John Taylor?Such a thing did enter into the heart of one of the TwelveApostles, nor any other man, except Daniel H. Wlells, and he said hehad a revelation that Joseph F. Smith was the man to preside overthe Church. There was not one of the Twelve Apostles believed aword of it, and Brother George Q. Cannon was the most opposed to itof any man in the Quorum of the Twelve. Because President JohnTaylor was the President of the Twelve Apostles, and he had beenvirtually the President of the Church since the death of BrighamYoung. (Now if Brother Cannon has become converted from thistheory, or any of the Twelve, they certainly must have some verystrong reasons for it. ()Now, Brother Grant, I have given youone of the reasons why I consider the President of the Twelve shouldbe the President of the church in case of the death of the Presi- 
 Los Angeles, CaliforniaMay 8, 1893.President Woodruff,Salt Lake CityMy dear SirYou will probably remember me, although we have not met for a number of years.The last four years I have passed in SouthernCalifornia, not on account of poor health, or for the health of Mrs Kinney, as both of us with God'sblessing are well and wonderfully preserved.I have been deeply alive to allthat has marked the progress of Events in Utah since my connection with the Territory as ChiefJustice, and Delegate in Congress. The billwhich I had the honor to introduce to Establish "Statehood," and support with a speech of considerable length near thirty years ago, published Entire in the Desert News," notwithstanding all your struggles to obtain admission, has notEven yet become a law, which other Territorieswith far less population, and I will addmerit, have been received with open armsinto the "Sisterhood"But my object in addressing you this letter, is not to recall the past, or review the present status of Utah,but to call your attention to a matter that 
 sending any young rooted Grape vines from the Escperimental GardensI would like to obtain Child's superb, Diana, and Grizly Frontignan,and the Delaware. If I could obtain two or three roots of each of theabove kinds; if they can not be obtained from the public gardens,if they could be sent from a private nursery I would pay whateverescpense you might incur in obtaining them.I have watched with much interest your labors in Washingtonfor the admission of Utah. Your speech upon Fernando Woodwas read with much interest by your friends here. I see bythe late dispatches that they have admitted most of theTerritories around us, but Congress seems to be very silent aboutUtah. We hear that you made a speech for the admission of Utah, we trust we shall have the privilege of seeing it in printbefore long. When we have done our duty we shall be contentedand leave the event in the hands of the Judge of all men,for He will do right, and all things will work together for ourgood. I do not know that I can give you any news fromUtah. I believe you are kept advised of all matters of interestin our midst.The present signs indicate the driest season we haveever had; very little snow in the mountains, and the streamsvery low. It is a general time of health with us all at present.We have just received a letter from Messrs. E T. Benson

 We do not understand that the Judge is requiredto find a clerk or attorney on examinations for he thenonly sits as a committing magistrate. The committeeof the accused to prison would have subjected theCounty to unnecessary expense. What Judge Kinghas done we have not yet learned but had we beenon the bench we should probably have let Warnerto bail had he got such security as would havesatisfied us of his behavior and appearance.While there is a strong impression among thepeople that Judge King, who is related by mar-riage or otherwise to a large portion of Fillmore,and that he and they are danish; we have neverseen aught that would convince us that Judge Kingwould judicially take any ground, but that which heconceived to be just; but if he does otherwise itcertainly is your place as Bishop to see that heas an Elder in Israel is put right.The Statutes makes the crime of rape thehighest known to the law, except murder in thefirst degree. It is therefore not at allsurprizing that the admission of the accused tobail has produced a popular outburst of rage; andif the people believe that their rulers would sanction

 G. S. L. City, March 11, 1859.Brother G. A Smith.Dear Sir—As brother Bigler is about to returnhome, I feel to write a few lines, and give what news we have.I call upon the President daily. We have no Eastern mail yet.We were quite interested in Cradlebaugh's charge to the Grand Jury,and in his bodyguard, but I think he has done like Sinclair, shothis biggest gun first. The Indian that went after the nine horses stolen at Grantsville, has returned with two of them, the others were killed. He says he travelled 200 miles, got to camp, toldhis business, and they said they would kill him for being a traitor.They brought up three horses left, and then shot down a stud be-longing to bishop Clark, and dried the meat, & tied the other two up. In thenight the Indian crawled out, took the two horses which were left, fledfor Grantsville and got in safe. He was followed by a bandwho went to Stansbury's Island, took all of brother Kimball's herd, some170, with his wildcat stud, and tried to drive them to the main land,on the west side of the island. When they were belly deep in water, they stampeded, went back to the island, fled into themountains, and the Indians got none of them. There is nowa guard there.(Private. When Dr. Forney's interpreter, Jebow, talkedwith the Indians at Grantsville, he told them they must notsteal any horses or mules with U. S. on them, and that if theydid the soldiers would follow them and kill them. He conveyedthe idea that they must steal Mormon animals, if any. That

They came to this city & visited the Presidency and Theater, printing office, Telegraph, and all places of interest, and they are highly delighted with all they see.

This land as you will readily suppose is a "Mexican grant" It is represented to be well adaptedto the raising of fruits, and grain, wheatand all the cereals, has also pastarage with valleys, and hills, two thirds arable, with a reasonably good supply of water. The owner claims to have a perfect title, resides in Sanfrancisco, and is anxious to sell the entire tract in a body to one purchaser.I think it can be had for one dollar andfifty cents an acre, on reasonable terms.I simply submit the matter,and in case you desire further information it will give me satisfaction to aid you inany way.With kind regards, and with special remembrances to "sheriff Burton"and other friends in Utah, and with best wishes for your continued health.I remain Respectfully Yours, J.

 dent. If the President of the Twelve Apostles is not fit to be thePresident of the Church, he is not fit to be the President of theTwelve Apostles. Again, there is another eternal truth stares mein the face. In case of the death of the President of the Church,Brother George Q. Cannon, Wilford Woodruff, the President of theTwelve (whoever he may be); notr any six Apostles combined have notpower to appoint a president for the Church. And as far as theappointment of Brigham Young and John Taylor was concerned, therenever has been a dissenting voice with the Twelve Apostles. AndI certainly do not believe, should President Taylor die today,that Brother George Q. Cannon nor any other man could use influenceor argument enough to convert a majority of the Twelve Apostles todepart from the beaten track laid out and followed by the inspira-tion of Almighty God for the last 57 years by the Apostles as re-corded in the history of the Church. As far as I am concerned itwould require not only a much stronger argument than I ever heard,but a revelation from the same God who had organized the church andguided it by inspiration in the channel in which it has traveled for57 years, before I could give my vote or influence to depart fromthe paths followed by the Apostles since the organization of theChurch. Again, Presidents John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff are theonly two men now living in the flesh who listened to the words andcharge of Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Twelve Apostles beforehis death when he said, "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart forfear I might be taken away with the keys of the Kingdom ogf God uponme before I sealed them upon the heads of other men. But I thankGod I have lived to see the day when I have had power to give theTwelve Apostles their endowlments. And I have now sealed upon yourheads all the keys of the kingdom of God and the powers of the HolyPriesthood, which God has sealed upon me. And now I roll off thelabor and work of the Church and kindgom of God upon the shouldersof the Twelve Apostles. And I now command you in the name of JesusChrist to round up your shoulders and bear off this church andKingdom of God on the earth before heaven and earth, and beforeGod, angels, and men, and if you do not do it you will be damned."Now brother Grant, with this declaration and charge ringing in myears, should I outlive President Taylor (an event I never expect to see)I should strongly urge my brethren of the Twelve Apostles to followthe beaten track marked out and followed by the prophets and apos-tles for the last fifty seven years. And I have full confidence tobelieve that the Twelve Apostles hadve had experience and lightenough to shun any path pointed out to gratify the private inter-est or any man or  set or men against the interest of the Church andKingdom of God on the earth. I once knew not only twelve men buttwice twelve leading men of the church undertake to appoint aprophet and president of the Church before the death of the ProphetJoseph, but they apostatized and went to perdition. And it wouldbe a very dangerous precedent for us to set to depart from theorder which God has pointed out. And it will be a precedent whichthe Quorum of the Twelve Apostles will never set from this timeunto the coming of the Son of Man. I was informed that presidentGeorge Q. Cannon used the argument in the deeding of the Gardo Houseto President Taylor as the president of the Church, that in case ofhis death the deed should not go to the president of the TwelveApostles, but to the president whom the Twelve Apostles shouldappoint (I certainly have no objection to that) saying that in the

 appointment of Brigham Young and John Taylor it so happened in thoseinstances that the president of the Twelve Apostles was appointedPresident, but it did not follow that that principle would befollowed out hereafter. And the argument was used to sustain itthat Elder Woodruff prophesied at a Conference at Ogden thatJoseph F. Smith would yet become president of the Church, and wewould have to deviate from the usual course in order to have thatfulfilled. Now if Elder Woodruff delivered such a prophecy by theinspiration of the Lord (which I firmly believe he did) it will befulfilled as sure as fate, and that too without deviating from thepath marked out by the Lord, and followed by the leaders of theChurch. It was said that that prophecy was recorded. I will alsomake a statement, that I, Wilford Woodruff, heard Heber C. Kimballand BPresident Joseph Young say that they heard Joseph Smith say in their presence and in the presence of others in 1832, the firsttime that Joseph Smith ever had an interview with Brigham Young,he said Brigham Young would yet be the President of the Churlch, andthat was four years before there were any Twelve Apostles chosen,and no man knew that Brigham Young would ever be an Apostle (unlessGod revealed it to the Prophet). And still, after sixteen yearsof revelation and change, Brigha, Young was president of the Church,without turning to the right or left from the path marked out bythe revelation of God. And that prophecy is alrso recorded. Andthere was not one chance in ten for that to be fulfilled that thereis for Joseph F. Smith to be president of the Church in the regularchannel of the order of God.Now Brother Grant, I have given you my reasons for be-lieving that in case of the death of the President of the Church, itis the right of the president of the Twelve Apostles to become thePresident of the Church, and that the majority of the TwelveApostles will so decide until the coming of the Son of Man. NowBrother Grant if you have any arguments or light outside of what Ihave presented as a path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in differ-ent from what we have followed as a Church, and will forward it tome, I will give it an investigation. But I will confess I do notknow the reason why Brother George Q. Cannon has brought this sub-ject up and made it a matter of conversation several times since theappointment of President Taylor to the Presidency, or that he shoulddepart from the principles he so strongly advocated in the appoint-ment of President Taylor. I see no reason why we should be soanxious to fix up vbridges to cross over, that we may never see inthis life. (It is a bridge I never expect to cross, for I do notexpect to outlive the President of the Church.) And I think we allhave sufficient business on hand to attend to without troublingourselves about affairs we may never see. Of course PresidentTaylor, like all other men, will die some time. When that dayscomes it will be quite time enough for the Quorum of the TwelveApostles to attend to organization of the Presidency of the Church.I will keep a copy of this communication.I remain your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,WILFORD WOODRUFF.

I know he is abusive at timesto his wives children and friendsBut as he seems to have but fewfriends, I have befriended him from principle, for I know there has been great prejudice against him from personsin high places.

States, since then I have bought me some little land and made considerable improvements which togathe[r] with sickness in the family has swolowed [swallowed] up all I earned and left me 
 I wish to say that in a missionary meeting of the Twelve &Presidency to get up a list of Missionaries to go to England SamuelSmith & Brother Jenson was put ^down^ Brother Young wanted to knowif Broth Jenson owed the king any service where he came fromyou will please find out. Brothe Snow I wish you would see if yourBranch cannot do sumthing for our Agricultural Society use your infl-uence to get them to organize a Branch if it is not done & Join the pastSociety so as to help us some in line of Business I will talk with youabout it when I see you.

 Bro Smith's course with menis not calculated to gain friendship;but Pres. Young sent Lot Smith to Arizona to establish and carry outthe United Order, and he has tried to do it, and I feel to sustain himin the matter in all that is right.You will seee by the press that light-ning has struck us, and themarshall has taken possession of our temple block, Tithing office,Historians office, Guardo house, andwe are all turned out of the president'soffice, and do business where we can,but we are alive, grow too fat, & feel well,and proves that gGod reigns.

 Mass offers 30 riegiments to protect Linicoln in his inaugarationFrom Lincolns speeches I should judge that He intended topitch into the south when he holds the reins of government.

 Preston July 26, 1895Prest Wilford Woodruff.Salt Lake CityDear Brother.Your kind favorof March 15 was received some timeago. But I hope you will pardon mefor not responding to the call. before.But when I received your letter my familywas not in a good condition. My childrenwere sick, and have been sick most all thetime since I received your letter.But now they are feeling better, and thingsare beginning to look more bright.Now Bro. Woodruff under circumstances ofyou ^will^ be kind and release me, "untill afterharvest this fall." I will then respond to thecall, and will go where ever you call meand do the best I canSoren. J. PetersonVery good. Let him have till after Oct. Con-ference, or till Nov. 1, if he prefers. J. F. S

 without funds and about $150 in debt this much for my financial condition. My family now enjoyes fair health. As to the qualifications for the position you speak of I must say that I have but a comon education and am far from being perfect in the german language, yet, when laboring in that mission under Bishp. Jos S. Horne in 1876-78 I was called to do the same work, knowing my inability I made it a matter of prayer and by the belessings of God and much study I was inabled to do my duty. In conclusion I will say, that I am willing to go or to come as God and His Servants feel to direct, and family or finances are no consideration when duty calls having a testimony of the truth of the Gospel I desire to joyfully labore in the cause of truth as long as God will aid and asist me. It is very hard to raise money down here this fall there being no market for either grain or stock, but I trust that God will open theway.

Your approvalof changes upon the Continent and method ^of^ sending our conti-nental emigration is very satisfactory to me. I trust that Bro.Jack and Spence will post the presidents of the Swiss & GermanMissions & Holland at an early day as they have already ap-plied to me for information respecting the new regeme.There is great enquiries for the back no. of the "star", saythe first ten volums. Please consider the subject and if youdeem it wise to republish, direct where it shall be done. It mightbe published on subscription; people are pretty well Conversent withwhat they would get for their money. I believe it would ^be^ a popularthing to do. I suggest ^this^ only.I have met with no suitable place to move the office toso far; but have it in mind, and I beleive it should be moved w[e-]repracticable [where practicable].Your favor of the 20th ult. reached me yesterday. Bro.stauffer was in the office when it came. I was chagrined to findmyself unable to carry out your reasonable suggestions. But he,Bro.

The Party that killed himwas undoubtedly from the San Carlos Reservationfor we saw signs all along from that place &were standing guard nights to guard against anattack from the Apaches. On our way through theReservation we had a very good chance to observe theCharacter of the Natives. Traveling down the San CarlosRiver to its mouth where the Govt Post is situated,we encountered a great many Apache Farmersnearly all having good 3 nich farm wagons andgood teams and harness.

 This spring and the prospect now is that I shallhave a plenty of all kinds of garden [sauce] ie if Iam well and able to take care of it-as to thehouse their has not been a blow struck on it sinceyou left Dr Ells did not come in as he agreedand that part of the house was unocupyed forseveral months and Elder Page has not been ableto furnish any lumber yet on account of itsbeing so scarce but will as soon as it can be obtainedI intend if it is in my power to do something on thehouse this summer I should be glad to have it completedbut I hope you will not attach any blame to me forwhat has not been done. I think my circumstances willbe a sufficien excuse to you—since last fall I have notbeen able to labour scarce any at all. I had a sorecome on my leg which has been very troublesomeand is now very bad. I do not pretend to labor anyexcept to do a little in the gardin by hobbling aboutwith my crutch—it is all that I can do to get breadfor my little family I am now scraping up the last of the flour or wheat I bought of you last fall Ithere was but 7 bushels of it that with one bushwhich I lost going to mill with what little I havegot along has lasted me till now. Brother Stillmanhas not paid me any thing on the order but I havesaid enough on this subject. I have no reason tocomplain. Eunices health is much better so thatshe is able to do some labor which certainly is a blessing to both of us—our Boy is well—the lastletter we recieved from home was of date Febr 8thFather & Mother Woodruff were then well and Fatherwas doing some buisness so that they were livingcomfortable he recieved you $5 note Eunice dreamed the other night that Mother was dead—we wantto hear from them & expect to soon—you speak aboutWilly he is well Sister Benbow will tell you abouthim as she is goint to write to you—things area going ahead in Nauvoo the top stones are nowbeing laid on the temple and they a are about 
 circumstances. They have about five thousand headof thorough bred cattle imported By the Govt. fortheir benefit. I also saw quite number of finehorses, Goats sheep &c. financialy they are pros-pering. All the men you see among themare arived with good Springfield Rifles, andplenty of Amunition issued to them at theagency. Moraly they are in a low filthy conditionthe soldiers and freighters in that country aredemoralizing nearly all of the women along theroad through the reservation. The Indians onthis (the San Carlos) reservation number about 5,000, alltold. They claim that they are not in sympathywith the Hostiles But I think without a doubtthey and them to some extent. The number of Hostiles on the war path is not known a greatmany of the Scouts that were discharged have notreturned to the reservation and it is supposed theyhave joined the hostiles. a great deal of damagehas been done by them and the soldiers havemade very little headway in capturing themThe Indians have a very rough country to fightin and it is almost impossible to get at themto fight them for they are like the Sons ofHeleman they run and never tire, and cansubsist on what a soldier would starve to deathon. There was three of the hostile scouts sent downhere by Geronimo the Apache Chief, to visit thePimas and Maricopas, to try and induce them 
 and make him presentable. He gave his overcoat to Bro. Herman ^before leaving Constantinople^and came here rather destitute. I gave him an overcoat and he hasgiven his note to repay the the money loaned him to get asuit of clothesI am quite sure that neither Bros. Herman nor Schoenfeldt are capa-ble of following up the good work of Bro. Fred. stauffer. He postedthem and they have a native Brother with them who speaks goodenglish if they need him, but I took upon Bro. S. as an exceptionallyable young man and I regret that we have no suitable man to replacehim in the Turkish mission. Perhaps you can supply the defficiency.Last week John W. stood upon his feet and with the aidof a chair took a few steps for the first time since Sept 30th.Junius F. Wells arrived Wed. on the city of N. Y. and pro-ceeded on same night to London enroute to Paris. He told me a talethat made me sick, and it seemed like a nightmare until day-light next morning. John has not communicated any of his busi-ness to me, He has never taken any notice of my applicationto him to pay me and I suppose the consequences must be bornewithout murmer. I am too much grieved over his situationto mourn my serious business' complications.Bro. James Anderson is in very good health andwould not care to be released at present. Bro Osmondhas been seriously ill and I have advised him to go to Londonbut he has gone to the north of Scotland and is not well enoughto endure that rigerous climate, ^shall^ try to have him take better careof his body. Whenever it comes right will spell Bro. AndersonI have taken care of his health all the time. I learn thatR W.

I will not able toteach the school this winter for lack of meansto support my family, and I will be forced towork for their support, outside of the Mission as there is no provision made to maintain theThe Teachers in that school.

Smith—Dear Sir—I will give youa synopsis of things since you left, as far as I can. First,upon matters at home. I will say we are all well in theoffice, as is your family. The winter has continued upto this time, with good sleighing, though the snow hasthawed some for several days. Cattle on the west range aresuffering a good deal. I have brought home most of minethat I could find. J. C. Little's eldest son, Charles, some14 years old, was buried yesterday. Sick two weeks. Attended byDr. Bernhisel. Lung and brain fever. President Young preachedat the funeral, and was much affected. I reported the address in myjournal. On the night of January 30, Hiram Kimball, jun.,with several other young men, had Catherine Ivins and Anne Rose in a sleigh, running a race with another sleigh. Kimball's sleigh turned over and flung the girls on the ice, nearlykilling Miss Rose, nearly broke her head. She was insensibleuntil this morning. She is some better. Hiram Kimball's head was bruised badly. A young man of Feramors Little's was killed in Big Cottonwood Kanyon, by a snow slide, on the28th ult., while opening a road through the snow. He wasburied on the 30th. Sister Smith received your two letters

 The condition of the mission is satisfactory on the whole.Tithing is falling off as it always does in the fall of the yearbesides many good tith payers have emigrated to Utah thisseason. Very little tithing reaches this office it is mostly usedby the Conference presidents to pay rents for Stalls and Conference houses.Some of the best missionaries we have are the poorest,and we have helped them alittle, by way of loan, and keptthem from going hungry and naked. The question presented itselfin this wise; assist, or release and send home. and I felt wecould not spare them; ^&^ probably not more than half a dozenhave, or rather are now receiving assistance in this wise. Thisclimate is harder on the elders, it seems to me, every year, andthe people are more in different to the gospel. The brethren act-ually feel good, in some localities, to even meet persecution thansuffer the silent contempt of the people.My wife is improving in health slowly but her heart isvery weak in its action otherwise she is comforableBro.

 many of the pupils have made marked advancementin reading writing, &c. also in singing SisterThankful Harmon has trained a very good Choirof Lamanites so they do good singing in ourmeetings. Our Brethren & Sisters that are working in the Mission are doing and feeling wellbut all are poor in this worlds good and cannot do all they would like to do. I think ifwe were working in the United order we couldaccomplish much more good among theLamanites, as they all labor more or less onthat principle. I trust that time will sooncome when can labor unitedly to build upZion and not be divided in to so many classesand such diversion of interest.

 from Salt Creek and Fillmore. It seems you find muchsnow south. The President met with the bishopslast night to make arrangements for raising the ox-teams in this city to send east. I think the President wishes the city ^people^to raise at least 200 yoke of cattle in this city. He is gettingout a circular for the Bishops. Concerning the news fromthe east, I will say there is a Gentile company formed, whoget some 15 pages telegraphic dispatches from Kearney, throughCronyn. The Saints have also formed a company for the samepurpose—Elias Smith, Clawson, Smoot, &c., who get the newsfrom the Gentile Company, until their comes direct fromKearney. Last week they had some fifteen pages, a synopsis ofwhich you will find in the D. News of Jan. 30, and the extra of to-day. But a small portion is published. Last week's Mountain-eer extra we sent to you at Parowan. Our mails will only come now twice a month, and the pony once a week. The last ponygot in last night direct to ^from^ Kearney, and brought 22 pages of tele-graphic despatches, due on tissue paper, which was taken intoPresident Young's office and all copied. I have just heard it read.It contains news from all the eastern states up to Jany. 22. Also a letter from Cap. Hooper, containing printed scraps up to Jany. 12.The following is a key to the whole matter. Six states have seceeded,including Georgia, and ^nearly^ all their delegation from ^to^ both houses ofCongress have resigned and withdrawn, and the other slave states 
 applicable to Demorcracy also in my opinion. It is a sourceof sorrow to all who love the truth and fair play, to witnessthe efforts, of otherwise reasonable men, to cram others withtheir peculiar political bias. Passeing the Priesthood of theson of God our plane and orbit is superior to the ordinaryor extreordinary political trickster; and we can no moreresort to their level in politics than ^we can^ to their Confusion inreligion. Those sweet delicate wispering of the holy spirit mustbe preserved on the [sturup] as well as in the pulpit.There is another subject whish engrosses my thoughtsat times vis: the tearing to pecies of our pe-Edmund-law fami-ly relations. If the spirit has given me the right under-standing, the Presidency have not counselled the putting a-way ^of^ a portion of our wives and advised polygamists to take theirfirst wives to their bosoms and live with them and none others. Ilook upon the family relation in the same light ^that^ I look upon thechurch, which is a sympathetic body and when 5% suffered, 95%suffered also; where one member is afflicted all suffer alike.I can say to my wives we will obey the law, but I would notfeel justified to say to five senventh of my fam, you must go into outerdarkness ^and live^ while I enjoy all the ^light^ law allows me with one wife;rather all suffer together and present an actual living protest tothe inhumanity of Congress which has essayed to break in peicesthose family ties which are stronger than death. Where is the firstwife who feels to accept an ^this^ advantage accorded by this [illegible] ^great^wrong to many of her tried sisters? I pray that, there is not one wo-man in all Israel who joys in the downfall ^misery^ of her sisters. Myfeelings are to day that I would much rather endure the Consequencesof living ^openly^ with my wives Catherine, Jane and Lizzie ^so far as the law alone is concerned^ than to live with eitherone of them and then do violence to my conscience.

There is still a party laboring hard inCongress to adopt Crittenden's Compromise measure to save the ship fromsinking, but the South appears to pay no regard to it. Seward isjoining the Compromise party, to try to mend up. The southern statesare taking possession of all government forts, arsenals, custom houses,mints, &c. A demand has been made of the President to evacu-ate Fort Sumpter and deliver it to the south. Armed bodieshave arrived in Charleston from the states, Georgia, &c., and it is fearedan attack will be made upon Sumpter. Memphis is build-ing a battery of 24 heavy guns. Louisiana has forbiddenthe entrance of any American shipping into the mouth ofthe Mississippi. All pilots are forbidden to take in anyU. S. shipping. The Alabama Legislature makes pilotsliable to fine and imprisonment who may bring vessels into the harbor ofMobile, and authorizes the commander of Fort Morgan to destroythe beacon and landmarks at his discretion. The U. S. troopshave concentrated all their force into one strong fort in Florida,I think; the rest are in the hands of the seceeders. Most of thesouthern states are arming as fast as possible.

 Great Salt Lake City, May 25, 1859.Brother Ilas.Dear Sir,I received your kind letter ofMarch 6th, and was truly glad to get a long letterfrom you, and to have you express your feelings freelyupon any matter you wished. I have much Iwould like to say upon both spiritual and tem-poral subjects, had I time, room, and opportunity.But it is such a difficult matter to treat uponreligious subjects with paper and ink that I veryseldom attempt it. I have always felt an anxietyfor the future and eternal welfare of myself, family,and friends, and I have felt an interest in thewelfare of the world at large; so much so, that Ihave travelled nearly one hundred thousand milesamong various nations, to preach the Gospel of Je-sus Christ, and for no other purpose than to do thewill of God, and benefit my fellowmen, thoughstrangers to me.I know that Mormonism is true, thatthe Book of Mormon is true, and that Joseph Smithwas a prophet of God, and was inspired of himto lay the foundation of the Church and kingdom,and to establish it upon the earth, to prepare the 
 It is my opinion that the family ties of such longstanding should be vindicated and not yeiled nor becrowded down before the flimsy web of ^that^ "might makes right."We cannot afford to be unjust ^to our innocents^ even to purchase immunityfrom our enemies. I know you entertain these sentimentsin your breasts, and you do know they are in mine also. Ifeel that any prayers are answered and that God is directingyou in this whirlpool of social changes which are takingplace among us. I pray earnestly that He will direct thehearts of the people to youward and they may know thevoice of the good sheppard in this day of visitation andtrial.Hoping and praying that you arewell &desiring to be remembered to the brethrenI remain your brother in Christ.Brigham Young 
 Kansacse Bill and the Pacific Railroad bill are calledup in the senate and all mixed up up with the Compro-mise measures, until the business of Congress is like Succotash.Every body and everything is excited. New York and Brooklynwere flung into a great excitement, from a report that there was a secret plan on foot, for 20,000 men, sympathysers with the south,to sieze the navy yard at Brooklyn. Troops were imme-diately raised to guard it, and many boats filled witharmed men, &c. The U. S. troops, by order of GeneralScott, have taken possession of the post office, custom house,sub-treasury, arsenal, and all U. S. property in St. Louis, Mo. The Legislature of Massachusetts has called aconvention proffered men, means, and money to the Pres-ident; as has New York, to sustain the public property of theU. S. in the south. The northern states are arming, orrecommending it. Georgia has sent a delegate to Englandand France, to negociate with those nations upon commercialand financial affairs. The southern states are callingupon the President and Congress to call a national convention,not to enter into compromise measures, but to amicably di-vide the property between the north and the south, but the northdo not now wish to do anything of the kind.

 way for the coming of Christ and the Millenium.Joseph sealed his testimony with his blood. BrighamYoung is his successor, and is clothed with the samepower and authority. If Brigham's enemiesshould slay him, and a thousand after him,it would not stop this work, for it is the workof God; he has sustained it from the beginning,and will unto the end. Every exertion hasbeen made, for about 30 years, to overthrow anddestroy this Church and kingdom. Not onlyhave individuals, priests, doctors, lawyers, of allsects and parties, tried to destroy it, but wholevillages, towns, counties, states, and the nationitself, with its armies, have been employed for ourdestruction. But the more they have kicked, cuffed,driven, persecuted, fought, and laboured, the morewe have prospered, increased, and grown, and strength-ened, up to the present day, and so it will con-tinue unto the end, for the very reason that God is at the helm; he established this work, and willcontrol it until the winding up scene.Nearly all the inhabitants of the earth, withdeath, hell, and the devils, are against us, and aremaking war upon us, as far as they have an oppor-tunity, for our destruction.

And it seems as though the wholeChristian world have their eye turned towardsUtah, watching for iniquity, and can see no sinany where else, while the truth is, the cold ChristianGentile world are perfectly submerged in a sea ofadultery, fornication, and whoredom, and allmanner of abominations, until they are fully ripefor the just judgments of God Almighty, whichare nigh at the doors, and will soon sweep them,as with the besom of destruction, from off the earth.At the same time they lift up their hands andpoint with holy horror to the awful crime of po-lygamy in Utah. And I suppose they woulddo the same if they stood before the gates of theNew Jerusalem, all of which will bear the namesof the Twelve patriarchs, the sons of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob, who were polygamists, having manywives, who bore sons and daughters unto the Lord. With these patriarchs the penalty of a-dultery was death, as in Utah.I do not wish any of our friends toborrow any trouble or to be uneasy about me

 the union I mail the weekly Herald of this week to youwhich is full of the subject & other matters which I hope youwill get for I think a New York Herald must be quite atreat to you out there I shall mail it with this Letterto day & direct both to you in care of S Brannan San Franciscoif this is not the right address please inform me in yournext Letter. I have got your three Letters carefully filedaway I think much off them. Mormonism is looking upin the world, & is now Herald forth to the four quartersof the globle through the American press. The world hasawoke from their deep slumber, and are startled as thoughthey were rocked with an Earth quake, in gazing at Mormonismwhich they supposed was dead but now behold it rises fromthe grave & stands forth in bold relief as an Independant sovraignstate holding in its hand the [FIGURE] key of the North American continent "whose Nobles are ofthemselves & whose Governor hath proceded out of the midst of them"  Jer 31 ch 22 vers [##Jeremiah 30:21##]And they marvel, wonder, & are amazed and know not where thesethings will End. All arivals from the State of Deseret, orSan Francisco are looked for with far more interest thanthe European Arivals Brother Young informed me thattheir wheat Harvest had come in well & would have an abundant Harvest to last though the year if they werewere not overflowed with gold diging Emigration who wouldbe oblieged to winter in the valley the[y] had from 10 to 15000ten to fifteen thousand passed through the vally this seasonon their way to San Francisco & they had litterly almostfilled the valley with goods of evry description which weresold for one half their original cost at New York &St Louis this movement has set the Saints upon theirlegs in the vally as far as goods are concerned. waggonswere bought for half what the Iron cost in St Louisto make them and a plenty of cattle also. The latest accountssay that their are 500 waggons between Green River &Fort Hall entirely Helpless their teams all drowned or diedfor want of grass & Hundreds others dying daily the road wasblocked up with broaken down teams & waggons & themen that wanted to pass was frantice & were fighting &killing each other & it was a Horrid scene of things, an expresswas sent from Fort Hall for assistance to try to save the 
 trunks, Boxes, & every thing of his own & all that anyoneels sent by him from the east, all the goods that Hepacked up at your House, what He got for the Seventies Hall, & all of Sister Sayers property & her Husbandwere all lost after they left St Louis for the BluffsI think it was by the sinking of a boat.Brother page is now expecting to go to Indianna this fallwith his family. Elder pearce is now out of work& has talked some of going to San Francisco I do notknow whether He will or not. Little & Hardy are still trading I do not know how well they are doingI got the Guardian & Star regular the work isstill progressing thoughout Europe. Elder Orson prattis in deep water but is abundantly able to swim with hishead above water & carry on his back all the Philosophers,Astronomers, Inquisitors, Learned men & Catholic & Protestant Ministers of EuropeHe is cutting a wide swath, building up the Kingdom & doing muchmuch good. The last European annal informs us that the Hungarians Armies have been defeted at all ports& surrendered to the Allied armies of Rusia & Austria& thus Hungary has fallen. I think Brother Cannonhas prospered in his business this season And thinks someof going to the west this fall.

Watchthe signs of the times, for they will soon indi-cate the storms of war, bloodshed, pestilence,famine, and tempest, which will visit thenations of the earth, and the United Stateswill not escape.But enough upon this subject. I thinkthat, the last time I wrote to you, or enemies,the judges, marshals, gamblers, and speculators,were trying to get up a collision between the armyand the Mormons, to keep up the excitement, sothat Uncle Sam's money might be freely spent.But Gov.
