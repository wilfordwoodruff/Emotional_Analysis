Brooklyn, Sep 15, 1897.  189  Prest. wilford woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah. My dear Brother:  With much pleasure I hand you here-with our financial report of this mission for the past quarter ending on this date. Our efforts in this part of "Zion" asmissionaries seem to be al- most with-out success, but still I do not feel to complain, as I believe that god is with this workand if we are persistant and prayerful we shall be led to the honest in heart.  Since my ar- rival in this mission -six monthe ago- we have only baptized Seventy persons; this is but a small number when compared with the great multitude that yourself and Uncle Orson Pratt immersed while you were in WEngland.  Our brethern here mostly travel without money, and especially is this the case in the rural districts.  There seems to be a slight spirit of investigation in the New England States Our Elders have recently baptized a family in Main that Prest. Cannon referred me to.  Some little intrest is manifest on Fox Island and near Boston also.  Our Brethern are received very kind- ly by the people in the West and south of Pa.  Ever praying for the welfare of our Church and soliciting any suggestions that you may have to offer, I remain, Your brother,  A.P. Kelser  ENDENTRY A. P.

My Brother is tolerably well. end of sideways text  Farmington June 28th 1845  Cousins Wilford and Phebe  While enjoying the pleasure of a visit with your dear parents in Farmington, in company with my Mother and being favored with more leisure time than has been my privilege for a long season, I thought I would improve a few moments in addressing a few lines to you. I have not ^much^ of interest to communicate but I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and some papers, (the "Star," which were gratefully received.) as also to give you some information respecting Mother's present of state health andc. It gave us all pleasure to learn that you were still in the enjoyment of good health and spirits and that so good a degree of prosparity attended your labors in the ministry and we will ever esteem it a privilege to hear from you by letter and know of your prosprty both in temporal, and spiritual things, and I doubt not but you feel equally desirious to know concerning the welfare of your kindred and friends in this land. Your Mother has nearly completed a letter to you in which she will give an account of herself and family and things apper taining to them and I will inform you a little respecting our family andco. There has been no very material change with mother since I wrote, nor since you visited us last fall. I have however considered her rather on the decline, indeed I know that her health in general is has not been near as good as it was last summer. Her situation has been such for a long time that that it has often appeared to me that we must all perish together for the want of strength to endure  Not long since we came to the conclusion that somthing must be done, some new measure adopted, and we finally decided to procure some good place and hire Mother boarded a short season we accordingly engaged a place, but when the time arrived for her to go she was determined against it and manifested feelings of such a kind that we could not, neither would we urge her, but thought we might adopt some better plan or at least more congelial to her feelings.  It was next proposed that I should accompany her on a visit to Farmington, and we finally succeeded in that thing. We hired a horse and chaise, rode very slow, made a number of calls but when we arrived here, she was quite fatigued, more so I presume on account of her being loathe to come and worrying all the way about it. What effect this visit will have  ENDENTRY July 3  upon her I am not able to say. One week has now expired since we came here and I cannot say that I think she is any better though not quite as noisy, yet she is beginning to worry and tease in the usual strain, even now she is in a panic while I am stealing a moment to write in my chamber, I had not thought it would be so when I comm- enced these lines but I find she will not allow me to be out of her sight a moment and might as well attempt to read or write in Bedlam as with her. I must now quit but will give a little further account by and by.  I find Aunt Woodruff's letter abut ready for Mailing and as I intend enclosing this in her sheet I must hasten its completion, and omit any further particulars respecting Mother. You will ^be^ able to discover that she is about the same as when you left. As it regards my own health it still remains quite poor as is the case with Sister Ann's, but by the goodness and mercy of God we have been ennabled to keep about and take ^care^ of our poor afflicted Mother—notwithstanding we often feel that we must sink beneath the weight of our afflictions.  Since I came here I have been informed respecting Uncle Ozem and family, they are all in comfortable health excepting Francis, he has been confined a long time with a lingering disease and it is thought by his physicians that he will not recover— none of them have visited Farmington since you were here. I long to see them but cannot have the privilege. I shall expect to return home in the course of 2 or 3 days if my Brother can make it convenient to come after us. I would like to make a longer visit, but I fear that we should be burdensome. Aunt Bulah has finally made us a visit for the first time since you left and is enjoying comfortable health, she has be^e^n very poor during the winter and spring—but is now quite well. Please write as often as you can. It truly does our souls good to hear from absent friends especially while under deep affliction. I have somtimes thought we were almost forgotten because far away. Cousin Webster has never written us and I do wonder very much as we have always been so good friends. You would be more excuseable because of your many responsibilities, but I think it must be the want of a disposition in them.  I must close by wishing you health peace and prosperity. Your Cousin Betsey.  The prophet is to be discontinued a short season if they can get few hundred additional subscribers it will again make its appearance.  Betsey Cossett Farmington June 28 1845  sideways text Your parents appear to enjoy themselves exc- cedingly well. I do really think they have a delightful situation, their house much better and more conven- ient than the one they formerly occupied. Your Father appears to be rather failing, he has some poor turns but still does provide all the comforts of life and has assisted Cousin Dwight and Eunice considerable.  I have neither seen nor heard anything from Br. Sparks since I wrote you. Br. Burnham from Windsor who ac- companied him to our house last winter has been to weatogue once or twice as I have been informed but did not call upon us. I wonder much, he is married and I think it must be to some one in Weatogue, a law- yer in that place said to my Brother the other day Mr B. has been ^here^ of late, he is married. I says, to whom: he replied ^to^ a lady just below here. I think it must be Jerry Enos daughter of that place I am not acquainted with the family but have understood that they were friendly and freely entertained those Brethren when they preached there I hope it is the case end of sideways text ENDENTRY Nauvoo, May 8, 1845  Elder Wilford Woodruff  Beloved Brother  Yours of the 1st ult. post marked the 4th, was received yesterday, also one from Elder Hedlock containing a schedule of the business and situation of the office, 36 Chapel Street, also one from Charles Miller of B. Young^ all of which We propose briefly to answer on this sheet to save time, for We are somewhat busy with a variety of matters.  We rejoice at the cheering intelligence you communicate concerning the work of the Lord in the Old World, and pray unceasingly for your prosperity, and are satisfied with your printing, and securing the Copy right of the book of Doctrines and Covenants, and if it is possible for you, it is wisdom also to forestall our— enemies in Germany; and secure the copy right in those ^or any other^ countries, and also the Book of Mormon, in the name of Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  We are satisfied with Elder Hedlock's proceedings, and have been satisfied, and doubt not he has done the best he could; You intimate that you think it not best "to send any more poor, gratis." It is more than a year since, we notified Elder Hedlock to send us more Emigrants at our expence. And it was one of the positive instructions given to yourself, before your departure from Nauvoo, to send no man, woman, or child to America at the expense of the office, and we trust that this last repetition of these instructions, at the 11th hour, will suffice. If any one has paid Clark, or any body else, Let that body furnish the passage according to contract.  We are glad if Elder Ward has made enough by printing to sustain himself, and that he is ready to co-operate with you in all things: If he were disposed to claim the continuance of the privilege of printing, on account of the licence given him by Elder Pratt; all queries might be easily solved, by the simple question. Who gave Elder Pratt the privilege of printing in England? Yourself or any one acquainted with the circumstances can solve this problem.  William Miller in his letter, wished me ^(B. Young)^ to do him "the favor to hand over £5 which I have, of his, to his brother Thomas Miller at sight." In reply I can truly say, I have no recollection of any £5 of his, or any other amount in my hands, which he will probably understand if he will think a moment. William Miller sent £5 to Elder Kimball to purchase a piece of Land. And Elder Kimball purchased the land— ENDENTRY according to his request; and at a subsequent period, Elder Thomas Miller one sovereign or more on William's account, but the Land is here yet, and if  William Miller wants the money for it, he had better authorize Elder Kimball or any one he chooses, to sell it for him, the money can then be forwarded to William or given to Thomas if he can be found. The last news from him, we heard he was at Charles Miller's writing, breathes the Spirit of the Gospel, we have not time to answer them now. please inform them as above.  ^Sent a copy of  the above to Wm Miller^  Should Rigdon's satellites arrive in your midst; you can by anonymous communication, through the Post office, inform the police, how Rigdon, their leader, declared on the public stand at Nauvoo, "that he held the keys of conquest, and that he would conquer Vic by the nose, and lead her out of her palace andc andc" as you heard it, and brother Clark also. this will be sufficient to cause him to be closely watched by police in citizens dress, and if he does not keep himself pretty strait, the proper authorities will attend to his case.  ^FIGURE^ It is a part of our religion, to support any government, wherever we may be, that will protect us in common with other citizens, for to this end governments are instituted. And as England has ever been true and faithful to us as a people, in common with others: The Elders cannot be too particular to enjoin on all Saints, to yield obedience to the laws, and respect every man in his office. Letting politics, entirely, totally  and absolutely alone, and preach the first— principles of the gospel of salvation, for to this end were they ordained and sent forth. ^FIGURE^  We are for peace, we want no contention with any person or government, and should war commence between England and America andc andc It will probably be wisdom, for you, and all the American Elders, to return immediately home, and leave all parties to fight their own battles. ^FIGURE^  Some of the caps are placed on the pilasters of the Temple, and all will be completed in 3 or 4 weeks, with our usual prosperity. The stone are in rapid progress, for the new font. The wall for the foundation of the pickets, or railing, around the Temple Block, and the block west of the Temple (to be in one) is also commenced. The brick are making for the Nauvoo House—140,000 feet of pine lumber were received last Saturday, for our public buildings; another raft is expected soon, and we anticipate they will all be enclosed early in the fall. The arsenal is rising on the first story above the basement. Emigration has been greater than usual ENDENTRY this season, means are more plenty: and if you succeed in your joint stock company, as you anticipate; a world of business may be done here next season; should ^that^ perfect peace, and union continue, which now prevails. Rigdonism has run its race in this country. It appears quite harmless when let alone, we have heard of but one they have baptized in America as yet, and that was an old apostate, and all that Rigdon has gathered out of the Church, are of no account, they have ever been doubtful at the best, no honest man can be deceived by such foolish sophistry and lies. We have killed it, by letting it alone. Brother Webster is lame, but out. Sister Webster is better than when you left, "Richards last week, bright as a dollar. It is a time of health in the "City of Joseph." The circuit court sits week after next. The mob are preparing to try to raise an excitement of some kind, we dont know what, but confidently hope and believe they will have little power over us. In God,  is our hope. We have little praying circles frequently, and your request has been attended to.  Elder Reuben Hedlock will make a safe, judicious, and trustworthy agent for the English Joint Stock Co, and we recommend him to the Stock holders wax seal for that purpose.  We forward you with this, in a package a letter of Attorney, constituting you an agent to transact all necessary business for the Church in the Europe.  Wishing you every blessing, we subscribe ourselves, your brethren in Christ  Brigham Young President—  Willard Richards Clerk—  N.B. We have it might be very agreeable to the feelings  of the English brethren to furnish a bell for the Temple. If this is their pleasure, you can forward it the first conveyance and we will have it hung as the building is going up. We are but little acquainted with the weight of bells, we have  thought of 2000 pounds, but we leave this to your judgment we want one that can be heard night or day. If the duties on such castings are too high, you will act accordingly to give us notice. B. Y. W. R.

Dear Brother:  Many questions ar- rise during our experience in this mission some of ^which^  I and my brethren are unable to answer.  One particu- larly rises in my mind and that one is the rise, pro- gress and winding up of the Kirtland Bank.  So  far as any published information is concerned we have  failed to find out much in relation to this subject.  In a general way we know it was established and  we believe all its liabilities cancelled when it suspended  payment.  Perhaps Bro. Reynolds will take the trouble to col- late a few items and send here to enlighten our ignorance.  It is customary for the president of the mission to visit the Swiss and German missions and also the Scandinavian country, I believe Bro Teasdale neglected it last year  and the brethren who preside wish to know the time when I can come to them.  I expect to go soon but  would like your sanction to do so.

INTRODUCTORY.  Dear Brethren and Sisters:  It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighth Semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that an Epistle should be addressed to the members of the Church, in con- forminty with the custom which has been observed at the past five General Conferences.  DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.  As some of the Apostles are pre- vented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, from appearing in pub- lic, the Church will naturally look for  some expression from them concern- ing their feelings and hopes respecting  the work of our God. Especially at the present time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles, because of  the loss which the Church has sus- tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its President, and each time the event has produced a profound impression upon its mem bers. In this instance this sad event is invested with more significance than it would have been had it occurred in the ordinary way. President Taylor died in exile. For about two years and a half he had been compelled to live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public association with the people whom he loved more than he did life.  Through his decease the Church is called the third time to mourn the de- parture of the man who has stood as its President and as the Prophet, Seer and Revelator to this generation. The  experience which the Saints have gained in passing though these trials has been of exceeding value to them.  They have learned that God can take care of his own work, and that they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or  doubt concerning its management.  After the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith there were pretenders who as- serted that they had the right to take his place at the head of the Church. Some were deceived by their preten- sions, not being familiar with the or- der of the Priesthood.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE  APOSTLES. For some time before his death the Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired of the Lord to aniticipate his own departure from earthly scenes. This was shown in various ways; bu especially in the great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priesthood which he had received. He  declared in private and in public that  they were equipped and fully qualified, and that he had rolled the kingdom of God on to the shoulders of the Twelve  Apostles.  PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONAL  TESTIMONY.  I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last man living in the flesh who was pres- ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I  owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, to the House of  Israel, and to the whole world to bear  this my last testimony to all nations,  that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph  Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostles together in the City  of Nauvoo, and spent many days with us in giving us our endowments, and teaching us those glorious principles which God had revealed to him. And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in our midst for nearly three  hours declaring unto us the great and  last dispensation which God had set  His hand to perform upon the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if with consuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with much of the power of God, and his face shone and  was transparently clear, and he closed  that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in  time or in eternity, with the following language:  "Brethren, I have had great sorrow of heart for fear that I might be taken  from the earth with the keys of the  Kingdom of God upon me, without sealing them upon the heads of other  men. God has sealed upon my head  all the keys of the Kingdom of God  necessary for organizing and build- ing up of the Church, Zion, and  Kingdom of God upon the earth, and  to prepare the Saints for the coming  of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I  thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled to give you  your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your heads all the powers  of the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest- hoods and Apostleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed upon me; and I now roll off all the labor, burden and care of this  Church and Kingdom of God upon  your shoulders, and I now command you in the name of the Lord Jesus  Christ to round up your shoulders, and bear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, and be- fore God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned."  And the same spirit that filled the room at that time burns in my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophet of God appointed no one else  but the Twelve Apostles to stand at  the head of the Church and direct its affairs.  THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES. When the Prophet Joseph had passed away by foul assassination, those who possessed the Spirit of God  and were living in close communion  with it, knew the voice of the true  shepherd and were not deceived by the claims of men who pretended to have  authority. The body of the Church followed the leadership of those whom God had chosen, and whom His ser- vant Joseph had been instructed to prepare for this great responsibility. The Twelve Apostles, with President  Brigham Young as their head, became  the presiding council of the Church.  The lessons which the Church then learned in regard to the Priesthood,  and the rights of the Priesthood, have never been forgotten. When Presi- dent Young was taken from us, there was no jar nor division of sentiment among the Apostles; and among the  people there was scarcely a question as to where the right of Presidency rest- ed. President John Taylor took the position which belonged to him, and  the work of God moved forward with- out interruption, and with a union and harmony on the part of all connected with it, most delightful to wit- ness. He has stood at our head for nearly ten years, and during that period he has possessed the gifts and qualifications which belonged to his  high office and calling. His entire  career is one that can be contemplated with the utmost satisfaction and pleas- ure by all who love the truth and ad- mire integrity in those who are called to be servants of God. From the time that he was baptized a member of the Church until his spirit took its flight  from earth, he never wavered in his ad- vocacy and defense of the principles of righteousness. Under all the varied  circumstances through which he and the people of God were called to pass, in the midst of the deepest trials and afflictions, his voice was always raised  in tones of encouragement and hope;  and when the storms were the fiercest,  he rose to the occasion and always displayed undaunted courage and un- flinching devotion to the Zion of God. In the providence of God it fell to his  lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and  Patriarch Hyrum when they were  martyred for the truth, and he mingled his own blood with theirs. Though  severely wounded on that occasion,  he miraculously escaped death. He  was a man whom the Lord loved.  The evidence of this is to be found in the fact that He chose him to preside  over His Church at the departure of His servant Brigham. We feel thank- ful to God our Eternal Father that we have been permitted to live with and  enjoy the society of President John  Taylor and be his fellow-laborers. Our association with him and the  Presidents and Apostles who have gone before him into the spirit world, we esteem as a great honor. We take delight in anticipating the rejoicing  that we shall have when we shall be permitted to mingle in their society.  Once more, the responsibility of presiding over the Church has fallen  upon the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The Counselors of Presi- dent Taylor, Brothers George Q.  Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being  members of the Council of the Twelve  Apostles at the time they were chosen to be members of the First Presidency,  have, since his death, taken their places  again as members of that Council.  Fifty-seven years and a half have  elapsed since the Church was organ- ized. In looking around among those with whom we associate to-day, how few there are left of those who, under  the Lord, helped to lay the foundation of this work and were the companions of the Prophet in the early labors connected therewith!  To-day there is but one Apostle left of those who belonged to the Council  of the Apostles during the lifetime of  the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at the time these valleys were first settled.  The other faithful Apostles who were ordained under the direction of the Prophet Joseph have all passed behind the vail. Since the death of President Young four have joined him in the other world, and in the same period six have been ordained as members  of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. This gives some idea of the changes which are occurring, and how rapidly a new generation is taking an active  part in the building up of Zion.  THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES. Those of us who have been at liberty to travel, have devoted our time to  visiting the various Stakes, and in  meeting with them at their Quarterly Conferences. Some of us have been laboring in Arizona, besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho  and in Utah. These Quarterly Con- ferences are attended with excellent results. The people come together  and receive instructions and coun- sel upon leading topics, and much good is derived therefrom.  Though it involves considerable labor for the Apostles to visit them, yet we are encouraged in doing so by the ad- vantages which those visits bring to  the people in keeping them informed concerning general movements and  counsel. In these labors we have had much joy and satisfaction, especially in witnessing the increase of faithful- ness on the part of the Saints.  THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS. Though many of the leading men have been compelled to be absent,  some of them having been incarcer- ated in prison, the people have, never- theless, been steadfast, and have  sought with increased diligence to per- form their duties. The persecution to which they have been subjected has led the people to think and act for themselves, and not depend so much upon others for guidance. This  can not fail to be attended with good  results. It is necessary that all the  members of the Church should exer- cise their powers of reason and reflec- tion and thoroughly understand why they take the course which God points out. Intelligent obedience on the part of His Saints is desired by our Father  in heaven. He has given us our agency to think and act for ourselves,  on our own volition, to obtain a  testimony for ourselves from Him  concerning the truth of the principles which He teaches, and then be firm and unshaken in the performance of all which is necessary for salvation.  We have felt great satisfaction in witnessing the dignity and courage  which the Saints have exhibited  through the trials of the past three  years. Their conduct has been ad- mirable. They have displayed great qualities. The forbearance, patience  and fortitude which they have ex- hibited are proofs that God has been with them. Outrages which would  have goaded any other people into acts  of violence have been of frequent oc- currence. In other communities men  and women would be desperate under such treatment. But the Lord has  given His people power to control  themselves and peace has been main- tained. Riots and bloodshed have  been avoided, and even under strong  provocation, when blood was shed, the community restrained itself. Preju- dice may prevent our nation and its  rulers from acknowledging, at the  present, how noble the demeanor of the people has been under these trying circumstances, and  with the strong provocations  which they have had to indulge in outbreaks; yet the time will come when all this will receive its proper recognition and due credit will be ac- corded the Latter-day Saints for their  magnanimity and self-control through- out this entire persecution.  PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC. In the organizations which have  been established among our people in  all our settlements in these moun- tains, the advancement and training and benefit of all classes are amply  provided for. Among no people of  whom we know anything have such  provisions been made for the salvation and care of the members of society of all ages as among the Latter-day Saints.  If we and our children do not progress in intelligence and in the  knowledge of all principles pertaining to life here and life hereafter, it is be- cause we do not avail ourselves of  those facilities which are placed within our reach. We have the Primary As- sociations provided for the benefit of the young children of our Church, and their instruction in those simple prin- ciples which they can understand. We also have Sunday schools for the training and education of those of  larger growth. In them they can learn the doctrines of salvation and the his- tory of the work of God, and be pre- pared for greater progress. Then we  have the Young Mens' and Young  Ladies' Mutual Improvement Asso- ciations, which have been organized, as their names imply, for the development  of the young people of both sexes and  their advancement in every thing that will qualify them for lives of useful- ness and honor. But besides these or- ganizations we have the various coun- cils of the Priesthood, to some office in which every young man who is  worthy can be ordained. The young women, as they increase in years, can also find a sphere of usefulness in the Relief Societies which have been or- ganized for the purpose of assisting  the Bishops and Counselors and  Teachers of the Wards in caring for  the poor and relieving the wants of the  suffering and distressed. So that by means of these organizations, which are of vast interest to us as a people,  every one from early childhood to ma- turity, can be led forward step by step, from one degree of knowledge to an- other until fully qualified to discharge all the duties of perfected and honor- able manhood and womanhood.  So far as we know the sisters who have charge of the Primary Associa- tions are doing a most commendable work in arousing interest in the lit- tle ones and in teaching them in simple style those lessons  which are adapted to their under- standings. We hope that in all our settlements these associations will re- ceive the constant care and attention  of our wise and judicious sisters. The seed sown in the hearts of the children by the instructions imparted there will produce in years to come an  abundant harvest that will gladden  the hearts of the Saints who witness it.  OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC. The progress of the Sunday School  cause in Zion continues satisfactory,  though undoubtedly somewhat re- tarded by the enforced absence from its labors and associations of so many  brethren and sisters who have in former years taken an active interest  in its welfare. We notice, with pleas- ure, the constantly increasing number  of schools, teachers and scholars re- ported by the officers of the Union and  the evident care taken by the presiding  local authorities in our settlements to have a Sunday School as one of the first institutions established. We are also gratified to learn that in most of the foreign missions of the Church Sunday Schools and Improvement Associations  are being organized wherever  practicable. In Great Britain, in Con- tinental New Zealand, and  in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the  branches scattered throughout the missions in the United States, these institutions are found contributing  their influence in instructing and  forming the character of the children of the Latter-day Saints.  The Mutual Improvement Societies are also accomplishing great good  throughout our settlements. In connec- tion with them and the Sunday Schools, we desire to remind our brethren and  sisters who are engaged in the praise- worthy labor of fostering these insti- tutions, that the original design in organizing Sunday Schools and Im- provement Societies among us was,  that the children and youth of the  Saints should be made wise in the principles of the Gospel and their faith be developed in the revelations of God. This the officers and teachers  should keep constantly in mind. The books used should be almost without  exception, the revelations of God as contained in ancient and modern Scripture, together with the other  works of the Church. The teachings,  while direct, brief and simple, should be such as will increase the faith, de- velop the veneration and love, and  draw out the intelligence of the youth- ful bearers toward the divine princi- ples of which by God's grace, we have  been made the custodians. All at- tempts, however slight, to secularize  these institutions and to change them so that they will not accomplish the ends sought for in their creation,  should be discountenanced. The spirit and teachings of the Gospel should hold undivided control in all our ministrations connected with this cause. In the theological and other  classes all discussions should be  avoided as much as possible on sub- jects which God in His wisdom has not yet fully revealed. We know there are many persons who appear to take more  delight in dwelling upon questions which are mysterious and cannot very  well, in our present state of knowl- edge, be answered than they do upon  those subjects which are plain and simple and essential to present pro- gress. But the Lord has revealed  so much that we can understand  and that we ought to learn in order to be useful in the labors devolving upon us here, that we need not enter into discussion on subjects which in no  way affect our happiness here or eter- nal salvation hereafter. In our theo- logical classes, quorum meetings and other assemblies, therefore, these de- batable questions need not be dis- cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the  time of the members, to the exclusion of more profitable topics. In the  Primary Associations, the Sunday schools and the Mutual Improvement  Associations, singing should receive a arge share of attention. Singing ex- ercises can be made a great attraction  and also a valuable addition to the ed- ucation of the young. The interest  that is now taken among us in vocal  and instrumental music is a marked feature of the times, and this taste  finds increasing opportunities for its  development in the facilities which are now being furnished to all who desire its cultivation. Instead of having a  select few act as choirs in these institutions to do the singing for the whole, the voices of all should  be united in harmonious melody in giving utterance to the feelings of their hearts in hymns and songs. This will increase the pleasure of the meet- ings, and make all feel that they have  an equal interest in worship and re- joicing.  THE RELIEF SOCIETIES. The mission of the Relief Societies as organized among us, is truly grand  and beneficent. There is no limit to their labors and usefulness while suf- fering and want exist in our midst. To aid the needy by feeding the hungry  and clothing the destitute is distinc- tively and peculiarly their mission. In the energetic performance of their duty human sympathy and divine mercy are beautifully harmonized. In  extending relief to the poor, the love of God and of our fellows is clearly  manifest. It is more praiseworthy for a relief society to be able to say "There are none in our Ward in need of food, raiment or shelter," than to  report thousands of dollars in hand, while the needs of the poor are un- supplied.  These societies have done a vast  amount of good among us, and the members have been of great service in assisting the Priesthood in the wards  in caring for the destitute and in sup- plying the wants of those who have been in need of help. In these labors we desire to give them every encour- agement and to invoke the blessing of  heaven upon them, and all their exer- tions for the benefit of suffering hu- manity.  THE CARE OF THE POOR. As the winter season is approaching,  it is proper that each Bishop and his  Counselors should take the necessary steps to properly care for the poor who live in their wards. They should call the Relief Societies to their aid in  this labor. The reasonable wants of the poor should be supplied and the pangs of poverty and destitution should be averted. God has greatly  blessed us in the fruits of our fields and gardens, in our flocks and herds,  and in giving us comfortable habita- tions and means to sustain ourselves, and we should always remember the  words of the Apostle James: "Pure  religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the father- less and widows in their affliction,  and to keep himself unspotted from the  world."  While it has always been the policy of our people to encourage in- dustry and to repress idleness in every  form, and to expect all persons to  contribute, according to their ability,  to their own support; still there are many cases where the aged and the in- firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with  the utmost exertion and economy, ob- tain through their own labors suffi- cient to sustain themselves. It would  be a great evil among us to encourage  any class in living upon the benevo- lence of the community. No system  of begging should be permitted. Those able to work should be fur- nished employment. Persons who are properly disposed will be glad to ob- tain it in preference to being fed with the bread of charity; and all should  be encouraged to labor according to their strength. This policy, if wisely pursued will prevent pauperism, de- velop self-exertion and confidence, and produce self-respect. It is a cause of great pleasure to think that beg- gary is unknown throughout our set- tlements. There is no need for any- one, however destitute, to publicly solicit alms. But while this is the  case, the sensitive and those who  shrink from asking aid, who conceal, in some instances, their poverty,  should be carefully looked after by the Relief Societies under the direction of the Bishops of the wards, so that there  may be no individual in any of our wards suffering for the want of food or any other article necessary to sustain  or preserve life. The community whose hearts are open to the cries of distress,  who are ready to administer of the substance which the Lord gives them  to relieve their fellow creatures, may  always depend upon the favor of the Lord, for He loves those who are kind to their fellow-men, and who admin- ister to their necessities, whose hearts are tender, and who readily respond to applications of this character which  are made upon them, or who antici- pate them by giving freely to the desti- tute.  FAST OFFERINGS. In some of our wards there is not proper care taken in the collection of  the fast offerings of the people. The first Thursday in the month has been  set apart in the Church as a day of fasting and of prayer. That day should  be strictly observed. Fast offerings should be brought with a liberal hand to the Bishop of each ward, that he may be prepared to supply those who  are dependent upon the ward for sus- tenance. Some wards require consid- erable aid from the Church to help  sustain their poor, because their own fast offerings do not supply them; while sometimes in the same Stake there are other wards where there are few, if any, dependent poor. Presidents  of Stakes should make arrangements  with the Bishops of the last named  wards to transfer their fast offerings to the Bishop of some contiguous ward which has more poor within its borders than its own fast offerings will supply. In this way all the peo- ple can have an equal opportunity of doing their duty to the poor.  THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY. Experience has abundantly proved  that those who are attentive to those and all other duties required by the Lord receive His blessing. God does  bless those who devote themselves  with singleness of purpose to His work. If proof of this were needed,  one has only to notice the condition of Elders in the various settlements who have spent years of their lives upon missions. Though their home affairs may have been left to the care of their wives and children, they are not dis- tinguished by their poverty from their  fellow-servants who have remained at  home.  We have only to look around us to satisfy ourselves also, that those who are generous in contributing to God's  work are favored of the Lord. This was the experience of ancient Israel, and it is our experience. Yet in re- gard to voluntary donations there is too much carelessness, notwithstand- ing all the precious promises con- nected therewith. The Saints should  be reminded of the obligation which rests upon them. Our children, also, should be taught this duty, that it may become a fixed habit with them to punctually attend to these matters.  Those who have strictly observed  these requirements can testify to the great pleasure and many rewards they have received from their observance.  This law of liberality appears to be one of the safeguards which the Lord has adopted to avert from his people the evil consequences which follow  the possession of wealth. He has told us that the riches of the earth are His  to give; but He has warned us to be- ware of pride, lest we become as the Nephites of old. We know the ruin it wrought for them, and we should  spare no precaution to prevent wealth  having a disastrous effect upon us. Many can endure poverty and be hum- ble and live near the Lord who cannot bear riches. They become lifted up in ENDENTRY Oct. 12 THE DESERET NEWS  pride and become covetous, and for- get their God. Those, however, who remember constantly the teachings of  the Lord concerning the earth and its inhabitants, and who contribute of the means which the Lord gives them to  assist the poor and help carry forward  the work of God, exercise a check upon themselves and give Satan less power to lead them astray. Under the pres- ent system of affairs, those who ac- cumulate wealth and are able to sup- ply themselves and their families with luxuries and advantages that are de- nied their neighbors, are in danger of  becoming separated from the bulk of  the people and forming a distinct  class. But the day will come when a more perfect order will be introduced. Then it will be said there are no poor and no rich in Zion—that is, we shall  not be divided into classes, but shall  all possess everything of this charac- ter necessary for our comfort and hap- piness. But until then, if we wish our  families and ourselves to remain Lat- ter-day Saints, we must be especially careful to guard against the deceitful- ness of riches.  THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS. The great labor which devolves upon  us, as members of the Church, is to  build up Zion. God has founded Zion,  and we should seek to extend its bene- fits and blessings unto all mankind. It should be our constant care to do  nothing that will weaken its influence or power or retard its growth in the  earth. This we should constantly im- press also, upon our children, that they may grow up filled with an abid- ing love for the work of God.  There has been too much neglect on this point. Many have pursued a  short-sighted, selfish policy; and have worked to that which they believed  was their own individual advantage without regard to the effect their ac- tion would have upon the work of God.  Their eyes have not been single to His glory. Such a disposition has proved a snare to those who have indulged in it; they have wrought injury to them- selves, not to mention the effect their  conduct has had upon Zion.  THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE. The Lord has informed us that mar- riage is ordained of God unto man.  The institution of marriage, in some communities of which we read, is fall- ing almost into disrepute. It is al- leged that there is a growing tendency in this direction among us. The cause is doubtless, traceable to the in- crease of wealth and the dis- inclination of young men to take  upon them the burdens of a wife and family. As we depart from the sim- plicity of early days, we may naturally expect that this tendency will increase as young men may be restrained from  offering marriage to young ladies un- less they can give them something like  as comfortable a home as they enjoy under their parents' roof. Extrava- gant or luxuriant habits or training on  the part of the girls will also have the effect to deter young men from marry- ing. Care should be taken by every  person of influence to counteract this  tendency, and to set before the rising  generation the advantages which fol- low well-arranged marriages. No community can prosper and maintain  a high standard of morality where there is a large percentage of unmar- ried young men and young women. We should deplore the increase of  such a class among us, and all honor- able means should be used to prevent  its existence. The young of both  sexes should be taught that it is not necessary to happiness in marriage to be in the possession of wealth. In  this country an industrious, economi- cal married couple can soon surround  themselves with all the conveniences and comforts essential to life and hap- piness. The satisfaction each will  have in after years in the enjoyment  of the fruits of their joint industry and  thrift will amply repay them for any in- conveniences or privations they may  have been subjected to in the early  days of their married life. The com- forts thus accumulated will be doubly sweetened unto them by the recollec- tion of their exertions in common to  procure them. No rightly constituted and educated young woman will refuse  an offer of marriage from a worthy, in- dustrious young man for no other rea- son than that he is not able to surround her at first with the comforts which  she may think she ought to have.  Young men, who have a due share of the qualities which women esteem in a husband, need not be afraid that girls of that kind will refuse them, because they may not be well endowed with this  world's goods. They will cheer- fully bear their part of the burdens of life without repining when confident of  the love and supporting and guiding hand of their husbands.  AGAINST INCURRING DEBT. We feel led to caution the Latter- day Saints against forming the bad  habit of incurring debt and taking upon themselves obligations which fre- quently burden them heavier than they can bear, and lead to the loss of their homes and other possessions. We know it is the fashion of the age to use credit  to the utmost limit, and it is custom- ary for nations, states, counties and  cities to borrow money, issue bonds  and thus load themselves with taxes  to such an extent that large numbers of the people are prevented from own- ing land or even the houses which they occupy. Thus the masses become ten- ants and have to pay rent for land and  shelter. This is a great evil and one that we, as a people and as individuals,  should carefully shun. Our business should be done, as much as possible,  on the principle of paying for that which we purchase, and our needs  should be brought within the limit of  our resources. The disposition to speculate and to take chances upon  ventures of one kind and another should be repressed. There are many people who have been rendered home- less in our Territory by the neglect of  this precaution. To raise funds to in- vest in some scheme which has ap- peared promising they have mortgaged  their homes, only too often, to be dis- appointed and to find themselves with- out a place of shelter for themselves  and their families. All this is wrong. If the penalty for such unwisdom fell upon the one through whose acts and  influence it is brought about, the con- sequences would not be so deplorable;  but very frequently families suffer  and the bad results are widely  felt. We, therefore, repeat our  counsel to the Latter-day Saints,  to shun debt. Be content with mod- erate gains, and be not misled by illu- sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re- member the saying of the wise man:  "But he that hasteth to get rich  shall not be innocent." Let our chil- dren also be taught habits of economy, and not to indulge in tastes which  they cannot gratify without running in debt.  ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED. We have been favored, as no other people have, with wise counsels.  Their extent and variety are immeas- urable. They cover every department  of human life. So far as we have ob- served them, prosperity and happiness have been the results. Whatever difficulties we may have to contend  with to-day are due, if not wholly, at  least in great part, to our disregard of them. Is not this the experience and testimony of all the faithful Saints  who have watched the progress of events among us? Had we observed these counsels, how many of the evils from which we now suffer would  never have been known among us!  Our neglect of them has brought its punishment, and the faithful can see it. But shall we not profit by the ex- perience of the past and act more wise- ly in the future? As the Lord has said (Doctrine and Covenants, sec. ##Doctrine and Covenants 90:36-37|90, ver.  36 37##),  "But verily I say unto you, that I, the  Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead with her strong ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and is clean before me: For she shall not be removed out of her place,  I, the Lord, have spoken it."  We should begin to understand that  God's ways are infinitely superior to our ways, and that His counsels, though they may seem to call for  sacrifice, are always the best and the safest for us to adopt and carry out. Thousands among us can testify to the truth of this from individual experi- ence. These thousands should com- bine and create a public opinion in fa- vor of obedience to the counsel of  heaven that will have its proper effect  upon our children and the inexperi- enced among us.  THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S. We also should learn this great  truth, that God will have all the glory and honor for the establishment of His Church and Kingdom on the earth. Man cannot claim it in this or any other age of the world. Nothing but the power of God could have brought forth the fullness of the Gos- pel, organized the Church, gathered  His people to Zion in fulfillment of revelation and performed the work  which has been accomplished. There- fore, as Latter-day Saints, we are obliged to acknowledge the hand of God in all the blessings we enjoy.  THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES. It should be the aim of all the mem- bers of the Church to carry out prac- tically in their lives the principles of  the Gospel. In no way can we better  convince the world of their truth than in showing in our acts and dealings  with one another and with mankind the elevating effect they have upon us. We make high profes- sions, and there should be such a high standard of purity of life among us as to correspond with these professions.  Our children should be impressed with this, and be taught that the name of  Saint is so holy that they only who are pure in heart can claim it.  If our religion does not lead us to love our God and our fellow man and to deal justly and uprightly with all men, then our profession of it is vain. The Apostle says:  "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"  We can best exemplify our love for our God by living our religion. It is  vain to profess a love for God while  speaking evil of or doing wrong to His  children. The sacred covenants we  have made with Him strictly impose  upon us the duties we owe to one  another; and the great office of religion is to teach us how to perform those  duties so as to produce the greatest  happiness for ourselves and for our  fellow-beings. When the obligations  of our religion are observed, no words  are spoken or acts are committed that would injure a neighbor. If the Lat- ter-day Saints lived as they should do, and as their religion teaches  them to do, there would be  no feeling in any breast but  that of brotherly and sisterly affection  and love. Backbiting and evil-speak- ing would have no existence among  us; but peace and love and good will  would reign in all our hearts and hab- itations and settlements. We would  be the happiest people on the face of  the earth, and the blessing and peace  of Heaven would rest upon us and  upon all that belongs to us.  If there be unhappiness and heart- burnings and quarrelings and hatreds among us, they exist because we do  not observe the religion which we pro- fess. They are not its fruits. Where these evils exist there is a crying ne- cessity for repentance. If any feel in- jured by the words or acts of their brethren and sisters, the Gospel points out and furnishes the way by which  this injury may be repaired. Instead of talking about this to others they should go to the person or persons  who have done the wrong and make their feelings known. If satisfaction is then made, that ought to end the matter; but if not, it can be reported to the proper officers of the Church for them to take the necessary steps to terminate the difficulties. In this way animosities and disunion can be pre- vented and confidence is maintained.  PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT. As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen- eral custom to partake of the sacrament once a week. If the teachings of our Lord,  in remembrance of whom we observe this sacred ordinance, be regarded, no  one who has trespassed can be per- mitted to share in it until he has made  reconciliation. It is the express com- mandment of the Lord Jesus that no one shall be permitted to partake of His flesh and blood unworthily. A more perfect system to prevent the existence of improper feelings and  wrongs among brethren and sisters can not be imagined. If the Saints do  their duty, difficulties do not remain  unsettled beyond the Lord's day when they assemble to eat and drink in re- membrance of Him.  TEMPLE WORK. Notwithstanding the difficulties that the Saints have had to contend with of  late, they have pursued their labors in every direction with unabated zeal.  This is particularly noticable in their  attendance at the Temples. The wish to avail themselves of the opportuni- ties for attending to the ordinances for themselves and their deceased friends has, if anything, increased, and those  employed in these sacred buildings have their time fully occupied in per- forming their duties there. It is evi- dent that the Latter-day Saints ap- preciate the blessings to be obtained  through this Temple work. When we  reflect that we have two buildings of  this character already completed, furnishing abundant facilities for all who choose to go there to  obtain the ordinances of God's  house for themselves and for those in whose salvation they take so deep an interest, and that we have  another Manti nearing com- pletion, and Salt Lake City,  which we hope to see finished before long, our hearts are filled with glad- ness and we cannot refrain from prais- ing our God for His goodness unto His people in permitting them, notwith- standing the opposition and many dif- ficulties they have had to contend with,  to erect such structures and to  dedicate them, according to the pat- tern He have given for these sacred uses.  No right feeling Latter-day Saint  can think upon this subject without being thrilled with heavenly joy for  what God has done for us in our gener- ation, furnishing us, as He has done, with every facility to prepare us, our posterity and our ancestors for that  eternal world which lies beyond the present life. The Latter-day Saints  are, in truth, a highly favored people, and praise to God should ascend from  every heart and habitation in our land for the great mercy and goodness which He has shown unto us. He has made us promises of the most precious character, and he has fulfilled them up to the present time. We would be the most ungrateful and unworthy people that ever lived if, after receiving such  wonderful manifestations of His good- ness, we slackened in our diligence or failed in our obedience and devotion to Him and His great cause.  FOREIGN MISSIONS. The treatment which the Elders have received in preaching the Gospel throughout the Southern States, as we are informed by President John Morgan, has been much better of late than it has been at some other periods. The Elders are listened to with more patience and do not meet with so much of the spirit of mobocracy and un- reasoning hate. Additions are being  made to the Church, and those who  emigrate from that region have gener- ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo- rado.  The Elders in the North Western  States under the direction of President  W. M. Palmer, pursue their labors with undiminished zeal and with mod- erate success in bringing people into  the Church. These fields of labor  have furnished opportunities for num- bers of our young men to gain experi- ence in missionary efforts, and those who have this privilege return home, in the most of instances, better quali- fied to assist the local authorities where they reside in the labors of the ministry.  In Great Britain the Elders meet  with considerable opposition in places, principally, however, from apostates. They find that field a much more dif- ficult one than it was in former years.  The hearts of the people seem to have become hardened, and great indiffer- ence prevails in regard to religion.  Still we learn from President George Teasdale, who presides at the present time over the European Mission, that the Elders who zealously enter into  the labors of the ministry find abund- ant cause for rejoicing in the success  which attends their exertions.  Throughout the Swiss and German  Mission presided over by Elder Fred- erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina- vian Mission presided over by Elder N.  C. Flygare, the Elders are laboring also with commendable zeal and with  gratifying results. An effort is being  made at the present time to preach the GoepelGospel in Jacob Spori, F. F. Hintze have been, and are laboring, and even the land of Palestine has been visited,  and in the late company of emigrants  which reached this City from Europe,  nine persons were gathered who had  received the Gospel in that land, a land hallowed to us as the earthly home of  our Redeemer, and the soil of which  his sacred feet trod.  On the Sandwich Islands the Elders are laboring faithfully under the direc- tion of President William King, and everything is being done to improve the condition of that people and to  save them from the destruction which threatens the extinction of the race. The Laie is still main- tained, and the Elders who have la- bored and who are still laboring there  enter with spirit into the management of that property in a way to benefit as  much as possible the native Saints.  The attention of the Elders there is di- rected at present to the Navigator  Islands, where some few years ago two native Elders from the Sandwich  Islands were successful in baptizing a large number of natives and organizing  them into branches. These Islands  have not been visited by any of the white Elders, but it is probable that some of our Elders on the Sandwich  Islands may in the near future make a visit there.  The letters which we receive  from New Zealand where Presi- dent William Paxman presides,  continue to bring us gratifying intelli- gence concerning the condition and progress of the work there. The  Elders are very successful among the Maories. Many of the white brethren  have succeeded in acquiring the lan- guage of that race, which is cognate to  that of the Sandwich Islands, and two of them, Elders Ezra T. Richards and Sondra Sanders, Jr., are now en- gaged, we are informed, in translating  the Book of Mormon into the Maori  language. In Australia the Elders are  also laboring, but it is a much harder field than among the natives of New Zealand.  HOME MANUFACTURES. Frequent reference has been made in past teachings and in former Epistles  to the subject of home manufactures.  It has been, and we feel it still ought to be, a theme of inexhaustible inter- est to Zion; yet there remains an im- mense amount to be done in develop- ing our resources and furnishing facil- ities for the employment of the people.  It is pleasing to note the progress  which is being made in some direc- tions. Our woolen manufactures are  gaining credit for their excellence in  other communities as well as our own. But we export considerable wool even after all our factories are well sup- plied. If this could be manufactured  at home, it would add greatly to the wealth of our community, not only in the profits which would accrue from the  use of machinery, but in the employ- ment which it would furnish to many of our citizens. Besides the manufac- ture of woolen cloths, there is con- siderable home-made hosiery of excel- lent quality which is placed on the market.  The range of articles which are  manufactured in this Territory is gradually increasing; and from the feeling which now prevails we judge that many more branches will soon be added to those already in operation.  The manufacture of soaps of various grades has now become a settled and  paying business. A fine quality of hats is also made. Boots and shoes and clothing, glass, white lead, lead- pipe, native paints, brushes, paper, printing type, starch, pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu- factured in the Territory, and many of  these articles in sufficient quantities  to supply the local demand and to ex- port to some extent. It is an encour- aging feature in the most of these en- terprises that those engaged in them  are seeking to enlarge their facilities  with the view to increase their produc- tion. We have a large number of  children growing up among us who  should be furnished with opportuni- ties to acquire skill in mechanism, manufactures, and other pursuit which are necessary for the comfort  of man.  It is not only incumbent upon  parents to seek for avenues of prof- itable employment for their children,  but it should be kept in view by the leading men of the Church in all our settlements. An idle man's brain, it  is said, is the devil's workshop, and  no community can prosper and main- tain a high standard of morality that  does not furnish employment for its members. Far better to work for low  wages than not to work at all. But with proper care, and by putting in use the experience that many individ- uals in every settlement possess, there  need be no want of remunerative em- ployment for the rising generation, and for others who may come in from abroad. It may not always be kept  in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per- centage of idle persons in a commu- nity is a direct loss to the whole.  It is unfortunate, also, for a  community, when the young  and enterprising are compelled to leave it and go elsewhere to find  employment or room for the exercise  of the talent of which they feel them- selves possessed. Settlements that  are in this situation will languish and go to decay, while other that furnish  facilities for employment will become thrifty and prosperous. The combi- nation of capital by means of co-op- eration would, in many instances, en- able settlements to start branches of manufacture and conduct them suc- cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how- ever, should not be encouraged, as their failure destroys confidence and makes it more difficult to obtain aid  for worthy enterprises which might be made successful. Where co-opera- tion has failed among us, it has not  been because the principle is defect- ive, but because of mismanagement,  sometimes from ignorance and care- lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from  selfishness.  Our country abounds in useful ele- ments. We have a fertile soil, when  properly cultivated, and an admirable climate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta- bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can  be raised here, and as superior in quality as can be found anywhere on  the earth. Care should be taken to raise the very best varieties. Our horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, as well as our grains, and fruits, and vegetables, should be of the very best kinds, and no pains should be spared to keep them pure. Our sys- tem of irrigation does not admit  of the cultivation of large areas of  land. Our farms are moderate in ex- tent. This being the case, they should be cultivated in the most approved  style, and the whole business con- nected with a farm should be con- ducted in a manner to bring the best  results. As facilities for education increase, there undoubtedly will be a marked improvement in the manage- ment of all these branches of busi- ness.  PRACTICAL EDUCATION. It is gratifying to notice the interest  hat is being taken among us in educa- tion; yet there is great room for im- provement. As the taste for what may  be called book-learning increases,  manual labor should not be neglected.  The education of the mind and the education of the body should go hand in hand. A skillful brain should be joined with a skillful hand. Manual labor should be dignified among us and always be made honorable. The  tendency, which is too common in these days, for young men to get a  smattering of education and then think themselves unsuited for mechanical or other laborious pur- suits is one that should not be allowed  to grow among us. Of course it is  necessary as society is now organized,  that the professions, as they are termed, should receive attention. But every one should make it a matter of pride to be a producer, and not a consumer alone. Our children should  be taught to sustain themselves by  their own industry and skill, and not  only to do this, but to help sustain others, and that to do this by honest toil is one of the most honorable means which God has furnished to his  children here on the earth. The sub- ject of the proper education of the youth of Zion is one of the greatest importance.  President Brigham Young during his lifetime established schools in Provo  and Logan, where the principles of the Gospel have been taught in connection with other branches of education, and more recently similar schools have been commenced, and conducted with marked success; in Beaver and Fillmore Cities.  The good results arising from teach- ings received in the Provo and Logan Academies are very apparent and pleasing to all who have the interests  of the young at heart, and we regret that such institutions are so limited in number.  Through the indefatigable labors of  Professors J. Z. Stew- art and their associates, these schools have done, and are now doing, a great  work in educational advancement, by  instilling a knowledge of the princi- ples of the Gospel of life and salva- tion into the minds of our children, upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of  God must rest in the near future.  We trust it will not be long before schools of this kind will be established  in every city and village where the  Latter-day Saints reside. In the  meantime, however, the Saints should not fail to avail themselves of the  privileges that are now offered them in  the Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore,  and Salt Lake Academies.  THE "CHURCH SUITS." Congress, at its last session as you are aware, passed a law entitled "An Act to amend an Act entitled an Act to  amend Section 5352 of the Revised  Statutes of the United States, in refer- ence to bigamy, and for other pur- poses," etc.  Under the 15th and 17th sections of  this law the Perpetual Emigrating  Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are respectively declared dissolved, and  in this Act it is made the duty of the Attorney General of the United States  to cause proceedings to be taken in the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah to wind up the affairs of said as- sociations.  Pursuant to the duty thus imposed upon the Attorney General, on the 30th day of July, 1887, proceedings were be- gun in said court by the United States against the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and its trustees, and the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its alleged trustees for the (Continued on Page 624.) ENDENTRY THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12  (Continued from Page 617.)  purpose of disposing of the property of the one and winding up the affairs of the other: asking in these suits to escheat to the United States large amounts  of property alleged to be held by these  two defendants. At the time of this writing nothing has been done in these cases further than to appear and an- swer the complaints. What the result  of these cases will be, we, of course cannot now say. It is proper, how- ever, that we should speak upon this  important proceeding and let the  Saints know how the cases stand.  The Perpetual Emigrating Fund  Company, as all of you well know, was conceived and organized for but  one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of  our people in their humble efforts to gather with their brethren. It has  been for this charitable purpose, the  object of the generous bounty of the  Latter-day Saints, but at no time in its history has it owned any real es- tate, or any personal property, save sufficient for its absolute needs each succeeding year. The Church on the other hand has been the owner of  property, the gifts and bequests of an  earnest, sincere people, made for the purpose of aiding in the propagation of the Gospel of our Savior Jesus Christ. The effort now being made by our government to dissolve or wind up these associations and  escheat their property, is the first of  the kind in the history of our people, and is believed to be without histori- cal precedent in this country. When we say we shall watch these cases with  deep interest, the Saints will readily believe that it is not alone for the  property involved in these suits, but  also for the principles and rights that  are at stake.  OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA. The intelligence which reaches us from our settlements in Arizona is en- couraging; and we note with pleasure  that the people of the settlements at Woodruff have conquered some of the difficulties with which they had to contend, and which made their position very trying. Indeed,  the news from all the Stakes there is gratifying.  IN IDAHO. In Idaho, though our people pay  taxes and support the schools, every- one of our faith is denied the privilege of acting in the capacity of a school trustee or teacher, and no one with our belief can take the test oath that  has been prescribed by the Legislature.  The situation of the people there is  one that excites great sympathy. They  are practically denied the rights of American citizens through the infa- mous test oath law which was enacted  by the Legislature. It is very trying  to their patience and bears heavily up- on them. But the day must come  when they will be relieved from the operation of this infamous law.  IN COLORADO. In San Luis Valley, Colorado, the  efforts of our people to open and cul- tivate farms, and to surround them- selves with the necessaries and com- forts of life, are meeting with gratify- ing success. This is the more note- worthy because of the fact that the great bulk of settlers there have  moved from a warm climate and have not had experience in battling with the difficulties that have to be met in the building up of new settlements in an untried soil and climate. Like the Saints in Wyoming, those who reside in Colorado have always received fair treatment and encouragement and kind consideration from their neigh- bors and the officials of the State.  IN MEXICO. Our settlements in Mexico are pro- gressing favorably and are gradually being strengthened, both at Diaz and Juarez. At the places named and in the Sierra Madre Mountains near the latter, we have nearly one hundred and fifty thousand acres of grazing, timber and agricultural lands.  The country is well adapted to stock- raising, as the grasses are of good  quality and great variety, while the climate is uniform, the temperature  seldom reaching higher than 80 degrees or lower than an approach to the freezing point. The facilities for making comfortable homes there are excellent, the land, water and timber  being good. A fine steam saw, shingle and lath mill, and a planer and molder, are in operation, affording building material within easy reach of  Juarez.  The treatment of our people by the national and state officials in Mexico  and her citizens generally, has been cordial and hospitable. By word and act they have encouraged colonization in the Republic. The settlements in Chihuahua afford abundance of room for several hundred families and they  could live there in peace, and by ordin- ary habits of industry would soon make  themselves prosperous and happy.  The Mexican Mission was opened in  1870, and the Church now has quite a large following of native Saints, mainly located in and about the national cap- ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice of  Warning, and numerous pamphlets have been published in the Spanish  language and are being distributed ac- cording to ancient predictions. Thus  the truth is being spread abroad among  the seed of Israel through the means of the record of their fathers, as well  as by the preaching of the Elders.  THE ALBERTA COLONY. Recent letters from President Charles O. Card, in charge of our colony in  Canada, contain information of a grati- fying nature. The soil upon which they are located is said to be very pro- ductive, and the grain and vegetables  produced are of excellent quality, and range for stock is abundant and nutri- tious. The colony is preparing for  winter, and the families composing it  will soon have their houses completed. They have opened a fine vein of coal  within three miles of their settlement,  which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.  The treatment accorded the Saints there, by officials and people, has been  considerate and kind, and the pros- pects for improvements and prosperity are good. Brother Card would be glad  to have any of the Saints, contemplat- ing a change of location, to join him,  in that land, and we will gladly ap- prove efforts in that direction.  We may be led, hereafter, to call  some of the brethren to go there with  their families, to aid him in developing  the resources of that goodly land.  CONCLUSION We cannot refrain from expressing to you our own feelings of thankful- ness that we live in such an age, and  that God has bestowed upon us His  Holy Priesthood and has permitted us to take part in His great work. We  are thankful that we are associated  with this people called Latter-day  Saints; that we live in a day when Prophets and Apostles have been raised  up in the Church of Christ; and that God has stretched forth His hand to fulfil His great and marvelous pur- poses which have been predicted by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began. We testify in the  name of our Lord and Master, Jesus, that this is the great work of which the prophets have spoken, that God is the founder of it, and that it will stand  forever, and accomplish all that has been predicted concerning it. Zion is established and will be redeemed. And it is our continual desire unto God that His people may be faithful in keeping  His commandments and doing His will, so that they may be accounted  worthy to stand, and their children after them, and inherit the great bless- ings which He has to bestow upon the faithful. The day is not far dis- tant when our Lord and Savior will be revealed from the heavens, and we  should live in constant expectation of  this great event, and seek, with all the energy and power that we can exercise and obtain, to prepare ourselves, our households, and, as far as we have in- fluence, the inhabitants of the earth,  for His glorious appearing.

April 16, 1894  Presedent Wilford Woodruff S. L. City, Utah  Dear Bro, I inclose a receipt for 7000 which I recd today, I am not intitled to the receipt because I have not sent the money for it. In the letter accompanying the receipt my attention was called to a former letter instructing me that all communications should be sent to head quarters. I am very sorry that any missunderstanding should occur, but I never had any communication with your office in regards this money matter, but it was had with S. B. Young Senior. While I was away to England last summer there was reported to me on my arival at N. york that there had been an aproprotion made for the Eastern States Mission of 3000 per month for 6 months to pay rent for a place for head quarters and also to hold meetings in with what few members there were and others that may come; Thirty-Dol per month for 6 moths would be $180.00  but we rented a place for 20.00 per month which ENDENTRY 48 Sands St Blyn N.

You will see only 3 familes, the others are, a wife or husband or one in a family.  There are several members of the Church in this mission either on a visit, or at the different places of learning none of which are included in this report, as I supposed they would be included in the wards of which they are members; we have tried to get some who are in New York and around to meet with us but they are so busy with their studies and other matters so that with one exception we have failed; the members we have are very much scattered, and in many cases the leavings of years, the ones with much life as a mle having left for Utah, but still we have many good people left in these parts yet ENDENTRY would pay nine months rent in place of 6 months, the nine months are out on the fifteenth day of May next. I have forwarded to you two of Pres. S. B. Youngs Letters which refer to this matter. I was informed of the tightness of money with the church, and I let the matter run and paid the money out of my own pocket, still forwarding all the tithing I received to head Quarters as per instructions from Pres. G. Q. Cannon on ship Alaska; The amt. I have received of this 180.00 said to be apropariated is as follows,          Aug 10, 1893 Chash check to S. B. Young Jr  $30.00     Sept 13 1893 Chash check to myself  30.00     January 27 1894 Chash check to myself 50.00     Total received -  $110.00      I have paid out for rent one hundred and seventy Dollars, Sixty Dollars more than I have received. Seeing that all the corrspondenece in refard to this money matter had been with Presedent S. B. Young. I still wrote him on the matter asking him to do me the favour to get the remaining seventy dollars sent to me. It was not with any intention of evading you in the least degree whatever; Now it was not a receipt of seventy dollars I wanted but a check for seventy Dol said to have been apropiated, and on the report to me ENDENTRY I have had some questions asked one in regards to some points on which I did not feel to answer, it is well known that among the world thy prevent ad distroy their children, and works of this nature are in the hands of the people, and those practices are quite common. And on account of these questions being asked me I  am lead to ask the following questions.  First, will repentance and baptism wash away sins of persons that have practised hindering conception and dis- troying the seed before life has entered the child.  Second, will repentance and baptism wash away sins of those who have distroyed their children before birth or after.  Third, Those persons who joined the church and have been away in the world for 20 or 30 years and have practised these things how would their case be.  If the above were baptiese, any or either of them, would  they be entitled to laying on of hands, and to receive the priesthood. Wishing you a happy new year and as many as you desire, from your Brother in the Gospel of Christ Job Pingree ENDENTRY of said apropiation I contracted the debt and have paid it out of my own packet.  I spend money to fit up the place about 70.00 but the people have paid me back over half of this amount and in time will pay it all; but while on this matter I would like to know what I may depend on for the future, will you help me out on this matter, or have I got to carrey it myself. I receive very little  beside Tithing and not very much is paid of that, but I have sent to head quarters in tithing this year over one hundred and seventy five Dollars and whatever money is sent I ask for receipts, and return them to evey person who pays the tithing.  I will say that myself and my brethren who labor here with me we have quite an expence in traveling and most of our other expences we have to pay ourselves. I trust I have written suffi- cently plain so you can understand me that there will be further missunderstanding about the matter.

Only a few days since Elders Walker, now in Steuben Co. N. Y. succeeded in Baptizing 14 persons into the Church, which with 22 or 23 others who had previously been baptized, mostly in this neighborhood makes the number of additions during the year by Baptism thirty-five.  There are at present many encourageing features promiseing  increased success to the Mission. There are now several places where more easy access may be had to the people than have heretofore been available.  I have at several times expressed my desire for more Elders in this Mission to members of the Missionary Committee. Prest Cannon and others, and have late in the season received some assistance so that now I have nine Elders with after releasing several who have been called home on account of sickness at home or their own impaired health. If no more are called away I will be able with my present help to keep watchful care over the places where Elders have been laboring, which is about all that can be ENDENTRY done during the severe winter season in the northern country where it is nearly impossible for Elders to get about, as reported by those who are there. But early in the spring coming,  present prospect would seem to justify the call for at least a  dozen or 20 Elders to engage in missionary work to advantage.  One very interesting feature of the work I would not fail to mention, which is the personal and very agreeable acquaintance I have been able to form with Mr Hammond, Editor of the "Brooklyn Eagle," and through this acquaintance a recognition in the paper of the Latter-day Saints as a christian community; and  a presentation in the paper, side by side with other religious denom- inations, of our doctrines and principles as reports of sermons andc. Also to have the time and place of our Sunday meetings appear in  the Saturday paper free of charge. The Editor has also expressed a  desire through interviews with me to become acquainted with the  history of the Mormon people, and of my experience with them andc.  The fact that such a paper as the Eagle will recognize and publish our doctines as freely from a "Mormon" Elder, as other doctrines from the most noted Rev. of other churches is itself throwing down the gantlet as it were to all other people, and saying, "they are as good as you," is a mighty sermon of itself; while it will carry our doctrines and testimony to scores of thousands of people, and in many places where personal testimony might never reach. Already ENDENTRY Very good letter. The money—$5575—I supp- ose should be returned to him as soon as possible. J. F. S.  50 Concord St, Brooklyn, N. Y. Augt 19, 1896.  President, W. Woodruff, and Council:  Dear Bretheren:  Permit me to acknowledge  receipt of your favor of the 12th inst, with accompanying Blanks for reports of returning missionaries andc: and to assure  you it shall be my pleasure to do all in my power to assist you in the realization of all that is desired, as expressed therein.  This mission has been somewhat unfortunate in having so many of the missionaries return home before their labors had become really profitable to the mission, or to themselves. Nearly all of them have been Elders without experience in the missionary field, and quite a number with very little knowledge of the Bible, the Gospel, or history of the Church. Very much of this necessary information has to be acquired by careful study after reaching their fields of labor.  Not having experienced Elders to labor with and assist this class, it is very difficult with them to over come the embarrass- ment which delays their appearing in public, other than by distributing tracts and having an occasional conversation with individuals. ENDENTRY some five or six articles have appeared of from half to two-thirds of a columne in length, while reports of sermons from other churches have had only a few inches of space in the same paper.  I have called upon the Editor of the "World" twice and have succeeded in getting 3 or 4 short articles in that paper, but find the Editor very careful about admitting any thing that would be likely to encourage discussion or controversy of a re- ligious nature; and he has extended very little encouragement as yet. I intend however to occasionally test his generosity, as by giving name and address I have already had important personal correspondence making further inquiry, even from professional gentlemen.  As to this department of my missionary labors, I have already about as much on my hands as I can well attend to, and find it inconvenient to be away from my office any length of time, with- out an accumulation of inquisative correspondence, both from Elder's and others, who are strangers, extending even to other countries.  There are 6 members and some children leaving here for Utah tomorrow, and quite a number more are making ready to  leave in the spring. They have friends already there, and are very anxious to reach them as soon as possible. Can Bro. Spence do any thing to assist then by way of reduced fares? I have no occasion to preach or encourage emigration, so long as the mission must depend upon its members for financial support, as its resources are diminishing greatly by absence of those able to go. ENDENTRY 50 Concord St Brooklyn, N. Y. January 1st 1897.  Prest Wilford Woodruff; and Council: Salt Lake City:  Dear Bretheren; Permit me to greet you again with a "Happy New Year," which I am  pleased to say we are enjoying here, and I am pleased  to hand you herewith Report of our doings in the Eastern  States Mission during the past year; both of Church and  Financial affairs.  The Elders in this Mission are generally well in health, and are enjoying their labors in the Ministry. Many friends are being made: places are being a pencil for holding meetings in doors more abundantly than heretofore, and numbers of persons are expressing themselves quite satisfied with the Gospel requirements. It is reported to me that quite a  number of persons would commence a new life with this "New Year" day by being Baptized.  During the past year much time has been employed visiting  among the people, distributing tracts, and thereby much prej- udice has been removed, and the first thereof is now ripening. ENDENTRY S. W. Richards Aug. 19 1896 ENDENTRY The Elders of this Mission, now numbering 27 in all, are mostly engaged in the States of New York and in  Rhode Island, and one in Maine. The northern parts of the Mission in winter are  so severe as to almost entirely prevent travel among the  people, and it has been thought advisable to locate near populous parts of the mission, where winter would least interfere with the Elders in getting among the people.  At a late Conference of the Elders held at Scranton, they were found to be so distributed as to anticipate succesful labors for the wintery season, quite as well as the summer.  The removal of Mission HeadQuarters last July from 48 Lands St to 50 Concord St was a change of considerable advantage to the Mission, as well as much more desirable for an Office, and  place of meeting; also, for more comfortable as a residence, with room to accomodate calling Elders with Lodgings, saving to them Expensive Hotel Bills, andc  A few competent Elders of Experience in Missionary work would greatly aid and encourage the many inexperienced who are already here. The accompanying Sheets will furnish you statistical information of additions, removals, and of the Missions finances, andc. ENDENTRY As to the inclosed financial account, the expenses of the Mission will be considerably less the coming year than it has been the past: less all the furnishings necessary to  enable those here to live at home, and by which Elders passing back and forth can spend a day or two when desirable without being at the expense of Hotel fare for food and Lodgings.  The item of Postage andc in the accounts has been much of it made by purchaseing postage Stamps with which to make remittances for the purchase of Books, Tracts, and Cards, which will be less till those are disposed of now on hand.  In refference to any matter in this communication, or other, I shall be pleased to have any suggestions or instructions which it may be your pleasure to give for the Mission's welfare, and  the entire conformity to your wishes.  Myself, Sister Barnes are all in comfortable health,  and have joy in our labors among the people. Sister R. is a great  advantage to the mission in many ways: not only in making a com- fortable home for those who must be at the office, but especially among the sick she is very useful, and by her attention she has secured warm friends to whom she has been a blessing and comforter. They join with me in best wishes for your welfare, and praying  that God may be ever with you. Most sincerely your servant and co- worker, for Christs sake.  Saml W. Richards, Prest "E. S. Mission."

Dear Brother: Enclosed please find financial report of the Eastern States Mission, which is the first three month of my jurisdiction  here. I understand that you are desirous of having me report  quarterly, our financial condition, and annually the Statistical, which I will continue to do.  As you are aware, our mission is yet in its infancey. I  have been kept quite bussy engaged since my arriva^l^ here, visiting the various fields where the Elders are, and organizing them into  Conferences, and Branches, and I am pleased to report that things here are assuming a prosperous condition. Our Elders are mostly  all traveling without money, and they report to me hospitable  treatment in nearly all instances. A few are being baptized in  all parts of the mission. In Philadelphia we have Nine Elders  who are working very zealoulsly, in tracting the City, and holding meetings; they rent a house and board themselves. I have four Elders here with me who are working in Brooklyn and New York: we hold meetings here at 50 Concord St., Sunday aftenrnoon's and a  Bible class every Thursday evening.

By waiting to this date I had hoped I had hoped to receive full reports of Elders up to close of the year, but I will wait no longer, lest financial matters be wanted.  There are no wealthy members of the Church in  this mission, and when those who work by the day pay their tithing, it seems all they can well do. Only two persons pay regular monthly donations for the mission, and their names do not appear on the tithing list. Other small donations are made by parties as convenient to them.  Of Church matters, such as No. Baptized and received,  children blessed, number Emigrated andc. with Report of Elders labors, I will forword soon, when delayed reports are received.  I feel truly thankful to Our Heavenly Father for His blessing attending the Mission work and for the pleasing prospects of the future which are growing brighter daily.  At a "Mission Hall" in this City, I am invited to preach when ever I can put in an appearence. Meetings are held nightly. I have been several time in attendance, and spoken with the  Minister's apparent appreciation—always saying—"Come again."

As a physiological fact, of the fifty-six children born to Brigham Young not one was halt, lame or blind, all being perfect in body and of sound mind and intellect; no defects of mind or body save those general ones shared by humanity. The boys are a sound, healthy, industrious, and intelligent group of men, noted everywhere for their integrity and for the excellent care and at- tention bestowed upon their families.  In short, the name Young is a synonym of a good, kind, faithful husband. Among them are lawyers, merchants, a railroad king, a banker, an architect, a civil engineer and a manufacturer. One of them is a colonel in the United States army, while several have graduated from the Annapolis naval school and from the Ann Arbor law school. The girls are finely developed physically, quick and bright in intellect, high-spirited and often talented, especially in a musical way. A few of them were beautiful girls, and are still handsome women. All are nice girls, kind in disposition, generous and social  in their natures. In short, outside of one or two of either sex, they are a family that any man might well be proud to call his own.

And she has suffered from the bitterest-hardships, and is lacking in the necessities of life. She is in need of immedi- ate assistance to get some articles of clothing before she returns home to Minersville.  She was very sick all the way from there, and is very poorly now, is very sensitive and hated to apply for help, but I con- sider her worthy of your attention, and that she, as the Prophet's wife, should be relieved and provided for the remain- der of her days.

Ordered out a possee of several hundred men and marched through the country in order to disperse the rioters or take them and bring them to justice. two or three of them were killed and wounded, and the remainder fled to Mo, or to the adjoining coune ties, in order to avoid the law. this caused a tremendous excitement around us and Mob Meetings were held in Quincy and many other places. threats, Inflamatory, Speaches were made and resolutions passed to the effect that we should leave the state or be exterminated. In  the mene Time the Governor ordered out a few hundred men, who marched into the county, and have now been here some Time, mostly at Carthage but sometimes in this city. they are sent to maintain the law, but they have ENDENTRY accomplished nothing as yet against the house burners and they never will. Gen. Douglass, and Majory Warren are at the head of the troops. But they have told us plainly that the prejudice of the people was such that the State cannot pesably protect us and that it is therefore advisable for us to remove as the only conditions of peace.  We have determined to do so in the spring. Their force is now reduced to some 70 men, and there is peace.  We held our General Conference in the tem- ple on the 6th inst. we meet in it now every Sabbath. The font and the rooms in the ateck story are nearly ready for use, and we expect to commence the ordinances of endowment in a few days, and to continue them daily through the winter. We also ex- pect to finish and dedicate the temple next spring. We shall probably sell and rent our places here, and rent the public buildings, the arsanal is nearly finished, and, the Nauvoo House, can soon be ready for the Roof.

Yours brother in the  Bonds of the Covenant  Brigham Young ENDENTRY City of Joseph August 21st A. D. 1845  To W. Woodruff,  Dear Brother, once more I write to communicate to you our situation, and progress, and how the Lord has blessed us.  We have been remarkably blessed with health this season and there has been very little sickness this season, and the Brethren have been enabled to labor remarkably, and they have raised grain enough to support twice the amount of inhabitants, besides, they have labored wonderfully on the Nauvoo House. The Temple is up, the shingles all on, the tower raised and nearly ready to put the dome up. The joiners are now at work finishing off the inside,  and within two months we shall have some rooms prepared to commence the endowment. The joiners will be able to finish the inside work during the winter. The committee of the Nauvoo House are driving that  on briskley. They have got their brick now ready, also their hive sand and timber. The trustees and committee being satisfied that Brother L. Woodworth was not a suitable man to go a head and do justice to such a building, therefore he was droped and Brother Wicks appointed architect of the house. The masons have commenced work and in two months the walls will be complete, and the roof will go on this fall, and be ready for the inside work which the joiners will comm- ence soon as they finish the Temple. The mobocrals begin to tremble, and make preparations for leaving this county.  and we pray the Lord to speed their flight. The Brethren have gathered in almost by thousandes this season, and are still coming from all parts. Your little boy that lives with brother Benboe is well. Their were fifty two of us  written on side of paper 22nd. the dome will be raised tomorrow end of writing ENDENTRY out the other day and took dinner. The twelve who are here and  their families.  Mother Smith and her children. All seemed to enjoy themselves well. Brother Wm Smith is here filling his place as Patriarch. I have gotten a carriage for Mother Smith which cost ^about^ $400, and now we have the pleasure of seeing her and her children ride out instead of going all the time on foot. You will have noticed the distress there is through this country occaisioned by fire. It seems as tho the people could but see the Lord is pouring out his hot displeasure by sending ^distruction^ on all parts; the Loss of property and distress is immense. A letter from Bother Pittsburgh was had tried its cable to the anchor of our not being able to get the roof on the Temple, which if which if we did. Rigdonison would fall, the roof is complete, the last thingh having been misled on above a week ago. We have hired the Emma for three years, and are about byuying the Masonic hall Tavern, and then we shall have the controle of all taverns in the City. There are but very few men left in the city that do not belong to the church. The New York store we have  bought out and they are gone. there are only Grubb and Richey left on the hill, and Clapp on the flatts, that are not with us heart and heaand. And we expect they will soon have. There are eight of the twelve now in the City and we expect Brother Orson has gone to take his place. Those who are here and their families are well. Brother J. E. Page is here, occupies a part of your house, is building himself a house close by yours,  Brother H. C. Kimball has built himself a house this saseason,  a fine large one, it is nearly finished. There are many good buildings gone up this season. Twice or Thrice as ENDENTRY many as in any one season before. We want you to keep all the American elderz, that are there, until we send more, which we think will be this fall in time for the brethren to return home and get their endowments by spring. But by all means let them tarry until their places can be supplied by men that we shall send, after receiving their endowments. so they will not be under the necessity of returning back immediately. aAs the Temple is so near finished we do not think wisdom to send over any more until they get their endowments. We shall then send about twenty this fall and more during the winter and spring, and you need not be surprised if you see Willard there in the spring. So be of good courage and may the Lord bless you all Amen. I want you to push forward the publication of the Hymn book and Doctrine and Covenants together with  all other books needful. Let their copy rights be secured in my name as President of the Church, and ^not^ the tear in paper Lord Father blss and comfort you and aid you to tear in paper a good work in his name.

(The members of the quorum of the Twelve who are in Nauvoo, the Bishops, and  one or two others have met regularly twice a week on Sunday and thursday evenings for some time  back to offer up our prayers and thanksgivings agreeably to the order of the Holy Priesthood for the  salvation and peace of the saints; and also that the Lord would over-rule all matters, so that we  might be permitted to dwell in peace, untill we could finish the Nauvoo House, and the brethren get their endowment.  For this we have supplicated by night and by day, and hitherto we have been prospered in a manner beyond our most sanguine expectations (We have never  failed in our meetings to ask God to over rule the courts which have lately been held in this county, so that the enemy might have no power to drag any of us to Carthage, or otherwise harass and perplex us with writs andc. and especially, previous to the extra session of the court which commenced on  tuesday last we have felt to pray that the hand of God might rest heavily on Judge Young, the  lawyers and the mobocrats, that they might have no power to do any thing against the truth but  for it, and you will see by this letter that God has answered our prayers and granted the desires  of our hearts.) Another subject for which we have constantly supplicated is the welfare and  success of our dear brethren in England, brother New York, the brethren on the Islands of the Pacific, (and cousin Lemuel in the west)  These with our petitions for the sick in our midst (especially sister Jenetta Richards who has been nigh unto death for some time past (but is now recovering slowly) the prosperity  of the Temple and Nauvoo House; and also that God would preserve us from internal bevils devils, has been the theme of  our prayers from time to time, and we are happy to say that God has heard and answered our prayers, and done  all things well. The most perfect union, peace and good feeling has invariably prevailed in our little councils which still continues. It seems like a foretaste of celestial enjoymant, and millenial glory.  (The names of the brethren who  have composed this council, are as follows: President O. Hyde,  John Smith, Patriarch, and  J. C. Kingsbury.)  --  (At the May term of the Carthage court the trial of the men  indicted for the murder of brother Joseph came on, which occupied nearly the whole session. It occupied three or four days to  impannel a jury on account of the lawyers on the part of the defence challenging every person selected, untill they  succeeded in getting a jury of their own cloth.  The Judge proved himself as much a friend to the mobocrats as if he  was one with them, and ruled the court decidedly in their favor; and although the evidence produced was abundantly  sufficient not only to hang those indicted, but also a number of the witnesses themselves, yet the jury brought in  ENDENTRY a verdict of "not guilty," and the murderers were acquitted on this case.  The court adjourned and appointed the  24th inst. to try the murderers in the case of brother G. D. Watt attended court and took minutes of all  the evidence and speeches on both sides, which will be published the earliest opportunity and you will then  see, how much justice and virtue there is in the Judges and courts of our land.  This matter was decided as we  supposed it would be, for we consider that it belongs to God and his people to avenge the blood of his servants. We did not expect the laws of the land would do it.  During the sitting of this court there were officers hear near all  the time with writs and subpoena's for the brethren, but they could not find any body they wanted, and the mob  were completely foiled in every attempt to bring trouble upon us.  Our prayers were answered and we gave God thanks. The court met pursuant to adjournment on tuesday last to try those indicted for the murder of brother Hyrum.  Soon  after dinner a quarrel arose in the Court House between the Sheriff (Genl Samuel Marshall, an old mobacrat; on account of some difficulty in the land sales.  Marshall abused Deming and threatened him severely. Deming tried to get away from him and backed out towards the office door, but Marshall followed him in a  threatening attitude, and attempted to seize him by the collar, till finally when they got to the door, Deming  very deliberately took out of his pocket, a six barrelled revolving pistol, and let his antagonist have the  contents of one barrel.  The ball struck Marshall in the abdomen.  He lived about fifteen minutes and  then departed to receive his reward in hell.  Deming was cool as the summers morning.  He immediately  surrendered himself, and was locked up in one of the offices of the Court House.  This circumstance produced  a tremendous excitement.  The mobocrats sent their rumers through the county threatening to kill Deming  before morning, and also to kill every Jack Mormon in the county but in this they were dissapointed  for they could not possibly raise a mob sufficient to meet the few friends Deming had in Carthage.  An  inquest was held on the body and all the jury except Daniel H. Wells gave in their verdict of wilful murder,  but Wells would not consent to it.  They finally had Deming indicted before a grand jury for wilful, premeditated  murder in the first degree, and the court has been occupied till the present in arguing whether Deming shall be admitted to bail till next court, and the result is, he is admitted to bail, and no doubt on account of his being  indicted for wilful  murder he will be acquitted.  The trial for the murder of brother Hyrum was dismissed  for want of a prosecution, and the court has had to adjourn, without doing a single thing, only cause one of the  mobocrats to be sent to his own place.  The judge has been sick all the time and acts like a person who has about  lost his reason, more like a fool than a judge.  So you will perceive this storm has blown over just as we desired and the saints enjoy peace and prosperity.  Demings course has produced a feeling of terror in the breasts of the mobocrats and they are quailed and unable to raise a breeze.  They have tried during the week to serve writs on a member  of the brethren here, but have not done any thing.  We are all safe, and the court is over.  We have mentioned these  particulars to show you that God is with us, and has kindly preserved us, and brought us safe through every storm.  The corner cap stone of the Temple was laid by the Twelve, on Saturday morning the 24th of May at 6 o clock, in the  presence of many saints.  It would have pleased you to have heard the hossannas on that occasion, and to have  witnessed the short but interesting ceremony.  The frame work of the roof is all on the building and the  ENDENTRY next week the brethren expect to go to putting on the shingles.  The frame work around the foundation of the  Tower is all up and the first timbers for the Tower itself was raised this day.  The new stone Font is mostly cut and the first stone was laid to day at about 4 o clock.  We expect in about five or six weeks the attic story of the  Temple, and the Font will be all finished and ready for dedication, and just as soon as they are ready we shall  dedicate them, (and go to work giving the brethren their endowments.)  We have all the lumber for the Temple on the  ground, and over 100,000 pine shingles for the roof.  The lead for the eaves and the Tin for the dome of the Tower is all bought. We have paid near $4000 this spring for Lumber, and near $1000. for lead and tin and have  as yet lacked nothing.  There is the most perfect union prevailing amongst the saints, and every man seems determined  to do all he can to roll on the works of the Temple as fast as possible.  Elder Hyde started East about ten days ago to purchase  the cloth for the Tabernacle, and Elder St Louis to buy about $125 of Hemp to make the cords for it The brethren are clearing the ground around the Temple, and we expect to have the Tabernacle reared so as to be ready to  meet in this fall. We are building a stone wall around the Temple block eight feet high and about five feet thick  at the base.  The wall on the north side is already pretty much built. The most of the wood work for the Temple is  finished; all the window frame and sash are made, and the glaziers are ready to set the glass which we expect here in a  few days.  The frame and ornamental work of the Tower is all ready to put up, and the whole is far under way. The G. A. Smith on that  committee in the place of J. Snider.  a large quantity of brick are all ready made for the Nauvoo House and  considerable means on hand to prosecute the works.  We calculate to have it covered in before winter.  The arsenal is ready for the roof timbers, and the timber on the ground.  We have also a pretty good stock  of furniture, ready to adorn the inside of the arsenal as soon as it is ready)  (We have the necessaries both of  the small tribe and large, all in good order ready to talk when needed.  We have 4 good peacemakers, all right.) There are many good buildings erecting in different parts of the Smith, which the Trustees  are building.  There is not much sickness in the place, and there never was a more prosperous time among the saints in general since the work commenced.  (The course of Elder Wm Smith since his return to Nauvoo has not been  such as we could have wished.  He seems to think he ought to be president of the church, and since he was ordained a  Patriarch to the whole church he has endeavored to get up an influence among the saints to persuade them that the office  of Patriarch necessarily makes him president.  We think to the contrary, knowing better and therefore but a very few that  will listen to him for a moment.  He seems determined to cause us trouble, but our prayers continually ascend up to our  heavenly father to overrule William and save him if possible.  However we know that God is with his servant Brigham  and will sustain him in his place, and we have no fears but the saints will do likewise, should it come to a trial. G. J. Adams has been cut off from the church for adulterous and dishonest conduct.  He embezzled money which  was sent from the East for the Temple.  Since he was cut off, he has organized a church at Augusta, I. L. and appointed  Parley so in prison) for  Patriarch.  Since that time his friends have forsook him, in answer to our prayers, and he is now selling his  furniture and every thing he has to pay his debts contracted to make scenery for his theatre, and we are informed he is about to leave for the East. ENDENTRY We hear little concerning Rigdonism of late, but have an idea that they have had such hot times in and  about Pittsburgh, that they have cooled off.  They make no proselytes only among apostate Mormons. Our cousin Lemuel in the west feel well towards us.  We have lately heard from them and all things look right there Your little boy is quite well and cheerful, as also your brother in laws family.  The families of the Twelve are all well except Dr Nauvoo or more properly the City of Joseph  looks like a paradise.  all the lots and land which has hitherto been vacant and unoccupied have been enclosed this spring  and planted with grain and vegetables, which makes it look more like a garden of gardens than a city and the  season has been so favorable, the prospect is there will be enough raised within the limits of the corporation to  supply the inhabitants with, corn, potatoes andc.  Hundreds of acres of praire land have also been enclosed and is now  under good cultivation, blooming with corn, wheat, potatoes and many other necessaries of life A great many strangers are constantly pouring in to view the Temple and the City.  They express their astonishment and  surprise to see the rapid progress of the Temple and the beauty and grandeur of Mormon works.  Many brethren  are moving in from abroad who seem highly delighted with the place and all its appendages.  In regard to your matter we have only to say that we approve of your printing the Doctrine and covenants in England  and would also wish you to continue the publication of the star and such other works as may be considered necessary. We also think it best for the Elders to tarry in England, untill we can send Elders from here to supply  their places who will not need to return for their endowments  We now conclude with our best wishes and prayers for your health and prosperity, with that of your  family and those associated with you.  Please remember us to brothers Hedlock and their  families, and all the brethren with you, and believe us to be as ever, yours in the bonds of the everlasting  covenant of truth and righteousness.   Brigham Young  P.S.  Sunday June 29th This day the 28th quorum  of the seventies has been organized and is nearly  full.  There are 27 quorums duly organized, and all appear united in the same interest and firm in the faith.  Brother Milton Holmes is remembered by us in his station.  He has been appointed  one of the presidents of one of the quorums of seventies.  We have just learned that all Augusta has turned against him and he has fled to parts unknown, leaving his debts unpaid.  There is no peace for the wicked is there?  B. Y.  sideways text Elder W.

In reading over your precious heralds my heart leaps for joy in anticipation of the blessed day when our warfare will be ended among the Babilonians and when we and all the faithfull Saints will "meet to part no more" as Sectarians say on "Zion's thrice  sanctified hill." My whole soul is invigorated by your cheering counsels to go ahead and in the name of him who has brought me hitherto I say—I will go ahead and make the grampian hills of Wales echo my testimony through the glens and clear my escuthion in the day of visitation.

With such in - centives to action who would not go ahead? Then need I creave a cintuation continuation of such support?  The interest of the cause and your love of souls will secure it.  Every item of news from you especially from our central home is sweet to me while here in exile from those I love and seek their counsell  But I find it would exaust all my sheetts and more to tell my feelings and attachments to you and to Dear Sister Woodruff and to reflect on past scenes spent in sweet harmony I must change the scene or my letter will be void of news,—well,—in regard to the affairs of the Church generally I am  ENDENTRY glad that I can answer in a word that though out Wales it is good, yea very good indeed I had like to say that perfect union prevails throughout the Principality, and among the Saints "The reign of peace" has already comenced. As to our numbers at last Conference you'l doubtless read them in the "Star." However we are increasing at the ratio of about 150 per month as near as I can learn. I have raised here in the Merthey the Mother Branch of Britain to over 800 mem bers!  A pretty good beginning is it not, especially for a Sailor? I have published 48 different kinds and size of Pamphlets comprising more original matter, (all Welsh) than the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Voice of Warning combined, and have circulated about One million, near eight hundred thousand pages, all of which preach of course, night and day, to rich upon the eternal truths of Mormonism and cheer the honest hearted. Many learned and some very noted men have of late embraced this work and many very rich and influential are at the door.  I have been at length enabled to subdue all my public foes here so that they hide their heads with only an occasional squib through the very holy periodicals. The power of God is made more manifest among the Saints as they increase ENDENTRY in faith and works. The gifts of the spirit are enjoyed in great profusion in almost every branch especially "the gift of healing" many instances I might mention which wd. make you rejoice—but I must forbear, broken bones have ^been^ repeatedly healed in- stanteneaus, and all kind of diseases nearly, cured by faith and the ordinances, but the ones that had attracted the most publick notice ^of late^ is the fact that a young man who had been deaf and dumb since 1840 received his speach and hearing perfectly when coming up out of the water of Babtism. He is ordan to the Priesthood and preaches with success since. This they cannot deny tho they sectarians strive hard to attribute it to some other cause, but the Saints give God the praise and glory. I have lately been on a tour through many parts of England and can truly say that the condition of the Church is bettering continually and more power manifested.  My lungs for the last year have been wearing out rapidly causing me great pain from which I wd. never be free hardly only when under the Elders hands, but thank the Lord all the Saints with one effort have held me up and now I feel some better than I have been.  I have seen Pres. Pratt and family in Liverpool and had much pleasure with them He is and will be an invaluable blessing to the British Isles, a God send in times of need, May the God of Joseph bless him always. You have doubtless heard with regret of our beloved Bro. Spencers illness, but he is sustained by faith and prayers of all in Wales and England too.

The work is a long way from what I desire but owing to the extreem smallness and poor clay. I was forced to submit as it is. knowing you will pass critisism on it in the spirit it is sent and being only a sketch will view it as such. Should you accept my proposition to model the Oxen for the Salt Lake Temple, I will endevor to make it as perfect as I possible can, and ask the advice of the best artist in Salt Lake City All the recompence I ask is my daily expences while working at it as it will need to be done, in Salt Lake City I will need a model Steer to work from, also a room, large enough to take a Steer in. Maybe there is a place on the ENDENTRY Church farms, should you wish 12 models made (which would not be as hard as it seems to be at first as as the principles parts would done with the first model, and would only need a little arrangings I would prefer to do it, but that would be an after concideration. but I think I could complete the entire arrangment in aboust 6 or 8 month.  I have often desired to do something of the kind for the aHouse of God, and would concider it a great favor were it possible for me to present the House with the entire work, but at present circumstances prevents me. I have wrote to President Cannon concerning the work and spoke to Apostle. A. H. Cannon and He will be able to speak more fully then I can write.

Dear Brother and Sister Woodruff  I was almost afraid I would not get a chance to reply to the kind letters of the 23 August and 3 Sept. from your own and Sister Woodruff's hands, but have from the extreme bustle with which I am surrounded and an excess of business, snatched a few moments. Your letters contained two sorts of news, one sort of a dismel notins and the other inexpresibly gratifying. The news of the continued oppression of the Saints met that reception in my bosom, which you might expect such news would meet in the breast of a faithful son of the Shamrock isle, It met with a sad reception and created in me a feeling of bert and unquenchable revenge. And proud am I to think that I am now in a Situation where I shall work about this end and prepare myself in connexion with others more efficiently to ac- complish it. In the mean time let the growing fire of a guilty conscience add woe to their misiries who have committed these acts that the hell of which they must eternally partake may begin and increase with them till they have paid the last farthing of their debt with a just interest. I was sorry to hear of your sickness but hope you have ere this become well and strong, also hope ENDENTRY your interesting family is well its branches are in good trim and comfortable winter quarters.  The best news your letter contained was that concerning my affections, love is well. That is good: So when I smell sea air again I may have bright hopes of before long seeing the swelling sail that wafts her to the place she longs to see. By love that will be a Jubilee of Jubillees to me. You sur I am no way bashful on the subject. You know all the affair.  Brother Stratton is doing well. Good again for my Brother Albert. If you see him before I do, tell him all that's good about me. That letter Brother Woodruff's letter mentions who under the blues can it be from. I would give a shilling to know and five  to have it. It is probably from my poor old father. Well, I'll find out sometime between this and Tib's eve or between that and the end of everlasting. I have sent ^you^ in a check with Brother Lee Twenty one dollars and 40 cents. They ave us a month and a halfs wages Two dollars and 00 cents money. The rest in cheque. I had calculated to send you ^considerably^ more than this, expecting they would have paid me three months wages, 48 dollars. Now I have sent you all they paid me except the $2.00 cash clothing is allwfully dear here and poor stuff at that.  Brother Lee will give you a full account orf our future destiny under Ltcolo. Cooke, and of what has transpired up to this time. I have thus far with much inconvenience kept my journal up ENDENTRY and shall continue to do so as long as I possibly can but really the many nicnacs in Military affairs, and the acuteness with which every thing has got to be done, make it very hard on me. I have still kept moving about and able to attend my business  There was an order read for the battalion yesterday from Ltcoll. Cooke appointing me Sergeant Major. This might have done well enough only for the unshipping of Brother Glines a feature I did not at all admire as he and I were on the best of terms, however, in the army orders must be obeyed.  I have had a personal introduction to our future commander Ltcoll. Cooke. His appearance though stern is page torn possessing. He has a noble head, and if he hapage torn not too much of an aristocrate about him will make a good commander I think. I understand he is pretty strict and there is no sherking from his orders. Perbilo. I laid your message before Bevan, and since then he has not given me any in- formation on the subject. I must come to a close. I have a thousand things to do. This report goes that we start to morrow. Accept my kind regards. Communicate the same to Mother Woodruff Cossitt, Brown, King and Barton Brother Taylor Family and all who care for my being.

Will you be good enough to answer the letter, and send some one there as it is in your jurisdiction, and I hope that there will be a great work done in that quarter. The Work is rolling forth mightily in this country, and many hund- reds are being added every quarter as you will see by the Stars.
