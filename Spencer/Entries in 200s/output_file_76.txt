 different and a better life, andwhile I have not done in the year,as well as I might have done,still I have succeed in overcomingthe tea, coffee, and tobacco habit,and this winter, I have overcomemy appetite for all intoxicatingdrinks, to wich (I am ashamed to say) I have been a slave for many years, and was just beginningto turn my mind towards my relegion, (for to be honest I had nevergiven it a real serious thought)when I received your letter. I have had but little educationstill am able to read, andwrite, and no doubt the exper-ence of a mission, would helpme in many ways. I have a wifeand four children, also a home, buthaving no farm, or income, perhaps it would be well to ask for a few months ^time^ in order to work andtry to earn a little means toleave with them. I think I have sufficient of my monthly earningsor rather the savings from my earn-ings, to perhaps pay my expensesto the states, but would also liketo leave a little with my family.Should you speak to Apostle LymanI think he will endorse all that I have said, as he has knownme allthe greater portion of my life.He was also well acquaintedwith my first wife, whoe's deathtogether with my ignorance wasthe cause of my being much morereckless, that I other wise, would have been, but at her death I tookto drinking heavily again, and while under its cursed influencecommited act that I should not have done, but in so much as

Jany 15th [18]96President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear Brother.Yesterday, I received a letter from you notifyingme that I am called to goon a mission to Great BritainI will state my circumstancesand leave it in your handsto decideIn the first place, I have madea Desert Entry on 200 acreswhich requires my presenceto make final proof inJuly 1897.My health is not very goodI have been troubled with ahacking cough, for a number 
 President Woodruff made the fol-lowing remarks:We are again called to pay our lastrespects to the dead. Upon this oc-casion it is one of the daughters of the Lord, a mother of Zion who has filled the measure of her creation. Sister Cannon was a noble woman, a noble mother in Israel who hasraised a noble posterity; and she hasnow gone to rest after spending herlife in upholding the principles oftruth and making them honorablein the earth.There are some things connected with this funeral that may be con-sidered unpleasant, I refer to theabsence of the husband of the de-ceased at Washington, where he is laboring for the interest and welfareof the people of this Territory, he,under the circumstances, not feeling to leave his post, but to leavethe remains of his companionin the hands of his friends and to the mercy of God. And also in the absence of her twooldest sons, one of whom is in Eng-land, the other in Germany, preach-ing the gospel to the inhabitants ofthose respective countries, neitherof whom, therefore, the sons nor thehusband, can be present to pay their last respects to their noble mother and companion.On such occasions whenmourning the loss of our departedfriends, I cannot help but thinkthat in every death there is a birth:the spirit leaves the body dead to us, and passes to the other side of the vail alive to that great and noble company that are also working for the accomplishment of the purposesof God, in the redemption and salva-tion of a fallen world. And the spirit of this our deceasedSister has gone to mingle with her little ones who have gone before her,and with her father and mother andher other family relations, and with her many friends who, like her, have wrestled with life and the struggles and troubles thereof, have overcomeand gone home. All is well with Sister Cannon. She is satisfied with her condition to-day. I feel withregard to her as I have always felt with regard to faithful Latter-day Saints, when they have finishedtheir work and gone behind the vail,that there are none of them thatwould return to their earthly bodies if they had the opportunity.In making remarks at funerals,which I have often been called uponto do, I have taken the liberty of speaking plainly my feelings with regard to the dead. And I willsay here, when I see a man or a wo-man, a true and faithful Latter-daySaint pass away, I do not feel in myheart to mourn. Why should we mourn for the woman whose re-mains lie before us? She has beentrue and faithful to the sacred and holy covenants that she entered in-to with God her heavenly Father; she has received those ordinances inthe house of God that will prepareher to go into the presence of the bestmen and women that have lived up-on the earth; she has left a nobleposterity to bear her name and to bear record of and to emulate herexample; she is freed from pain andsuffering and the anxieties of life,and is now beyond the power of the enemy of all righteousness; she has opened her eyes in the spirit world,among her relatives and friends and her own little ones, whose death caused her grief and pain; she hasgone to enjoy the society of those who have washed their robes and made them white in theblood of the Lamb, and to in-herit the blessings and glory of eternal life. No, I cannot feel tomourn for her. It is hard, of course,to part with our friends; but after all it is with regard to them, as one of old said. It is better to go to thehouse of mourning than the house of feasting. It is natural for us to give expression to our feelings in tearsin laying away the bodies of our be-loved friends, and there is a degree to which we may go which is properand right; but there are extremes which are often indulged in, whichis neither proper nor right for Lat-ter day Saints to copy after. Here,however, as I have said, we have nothing to mourn about as far asSister Cannon is concerned.When I say that I have never feltto mourn for any faithful man orwoman who has died in this Church, I must make one exception; I did feel to mourn, and so did allIsrael, the death of our martyred Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. But we did not mourn on account of them person-ally, for they had passed through all that any martyr ever did or could, but we felt to mourn their loss to the Church as our leaders to whom we had learned to look for counsel and advicein every hour of trouble and trial, although there is something very dreadful in the thought of assassin-ating men, whether they be Pro-phets or Apostles, or whether they be emperors or presidents. Withthat exception I have not felt tomourn for any faithful person whohas gathered up his feet and goneto sleep with the fathers. I have felt rather, that they have gained a victory which but few of the hu-man family have gained in theirday and generation. For you willfind, my brethren and sisters, there there are but a very few compara-tively, either male or female, whohave had independence of mindenough, as well as honesty of heart sufficient to receive the Gospel ofChrist. It takes independence of mind, honesty of heart, faith inGod, and firmness of character tolive the life of a Latter-day Saint, in the face of a frowning world, andin the midst of trials and troubles and persecution.The spirit of Sister Cannon hasleft us; her body is here awaiting thepurifying changes it must undergoin mother earth. But whether herspirit is present witnessing thesefuneral services, or whether she, on opening her eyes in the spiritworld, would say, "I leavemy body for my friends to bury, I must enter upon my mission," that is something we are not able to speak definitely about. Godnot having revealed it untous. But this we do know, sheis all right, because she was thor-oughly prepared for the change thatawaited her; and she has gone to doall that she can for those of herkindred and friends that are to fol-low. And what more can you say? We are left, and we are doing for Sister Cannon what our friends, sooner or later, will be doing for us.It will not be very long before Bro-ther Cannon and also the children and friends of the deceased who re-remain will join her in the spirit-world, if it is not until the comingof Christ. This admonition comes home forcibly to the living, "Be ye also ready." And it applies to usall. And it is for us as parents andElders of Israel to labor in thecause of God while we are permitted to tarry; living up to the light and knowledge that we have been blessed with. For there is a time appointed unto all men; and Hetakes away many according to thecounsels of His own will. He takeswhom He will take, and spares whom he will spare for a wise pur-pose in Himself. These things are according to the purposes and ordi-nation of God to man. Some labor this side of the vail, others on the other side of the vail. If we tarryhere we expect to labor in the cause of salvation, and if we go hence we expect to continue our work untilthe coming of the Son of Man. The only difference is, while we are here we are subject to pain and sorrow, while they on the other side arefree from affliction of every kind.I pray to God to comfort the heart of Brother Cannon in this his sad be-reavement, and to sustain him bythe power of His Spirit; and I pray that his wives and children may beblessed and preserved in the truth,that at last he and they, togetherwith this his companion, whosevoice is now hushed in death, maycome forth in the morning of thefirst resurrection, and stand in theirfamily organization clothed withglory, immortality and and eternallives, to join with the redeemed and sanctified in exclaiming:"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"

We can hardly say"laziness is the unpardonable sin." butit will lead to it if persisted in longenough.
