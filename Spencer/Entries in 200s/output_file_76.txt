 P.S. Would it be foconvenient for me to go through  the temple and also be set apart between Monday,   June 29th, and Wed. evening Junely 1st, or would it   be better to have the endowments attended to the  week previous?    About how large a company will be leaving July 2nd,   and over which R.R. will they travel?    Will there be another company leaving between the  2nd and 15th of July. If so I would like to know  and if it made no difference, perhaps it would  be more convenient for me to leave a little later  than the 2nd.

 he would be lost that his family  would be scattered and that he  would go to wreck and ruin and  I felt that if I could be the  means where-by he could be saved  for he exclaimed God know you  may be the means of saving me I  felt if I refused and he with   his family were lost I would  be a great deal to blame for it  I am constantly praying about it  I am trying to convince him of   the truth of the Gospel but It  seems very hard I persuade  him to go to our meetings and  he seems to like them very  much and I have faith that  some day he will believe I   have promised to marry him  and he is now cheerful and  happy but I am greatly troubled

Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    In answer to your inquirie  whether It would be agreeable   to my feelings & consistant  with circumstances to be  called on a foreeign mission    My feelings are perfectly  agreeable. I can get the  neceasyary^cessiary fund although  I have no father to  depend on. My oldest  brother is Just fourteen years  of age.    I have not bin of much  use to the family, but 
 different and a better life, and  while I have not done in the year,  as well as I might have done,  still I have succeed in overcoming  the tea, coffee, and tobacco habit,  and this winter, I have overcome  my appetite for all intoxicating  drinks, to wich (I am ashamed   to say) I have been a slave for   many years, and was just beginning  to turn my mind towards my   relegion, (for to be honest I had never  given it a real serious thought)  when I received your letter. I   have had but little education  still am able to read, and  write, and no doubt the exper-  ence of a mission, would help  me in many ways. I have a wife  and four children, also a home, but  having no farm, or income, perhaps   it would be well to ask for a   few months ^time^ in order to work and  try to earn a little means to  leave with them. I think I have   sufficient of my monthly earnings  or rather the savings from my earn-  ings, to perhaps pay my expenses  to the states, but would also like  to leave a little with my family.  Should you speak to Apostle Lyman  I think he will endorse all that   I have said, as he has known  me allthe greater portion of my life.  He was also well acquainted  with my first wife, whoe's death  together with my ignorance was  the cause of my being much more  reckless, that I other wise, would   have been, but at her death I took  to drinking heavily again, and   while under its cursed influence  commited act that I should not   have done, but in so much as

 I have repented, and try to live a   better life in the future, and  as our Father in Heaven is a mercy-  ful, one, I feel that he will forgive  many of my wrong doings. As to  my own feelings I feel that a  mission would, (as the saying is)  be the making of me, and while,  my circumstances are not the best,  and while I know but very little in  regards to the Gospel, I am willing to   put my trust in him who governs all  things, and do the best I can.  My wife also is anxious that I should  go, and now I think this is all. You   will see I have not been very faithful  Your letter states faithful Elders are needed  &c) but trust I will be more so, from this  time forth, and now as I have given   you a sketch of my life, and if you still  deem me worthy to go, please let me   know as soon as possible, and I   will arrange my affairs accordingly    As I am Your obedient Servant,    Peter.

 President Woodruff made the fol-  lowing remarks:    We are again called to pay our last  respects to the dead. Upon this oc-  casion it is one of the daughters of   the Lord, a mother of Zion who has   filled the measure of her creation.   Sister Cannon was a noble woman,   a noble mother in Israel who has  raised a noble posterity; and she has  now gone to rest after spending her  life in upholding the principles of  truth and making them honorable  in the earth.    There are some things connected   with this funeral that may be con-  sidered unpleasant, I refer to the  absence of the husband of the de-  ceased at Washington, where he is   laboring for the interest and welfare  of the people of this Territory, he,  under the circumstances, not feeling   to leave his post, but to leave  the remains of his companion  in the hands of his friends   and to the mercy of God. And   also in the absence of her two  oldest sons, one of whom is in Eng-  land, the other in Germany, preach-  ing the gospel to the inhabitants of  those respective countries, neither  of whom, therefore, the sons nor the  husband, can be present to pay their   last respects to their noble mother   and companion.    On such occasions when  mourning the loss of our departed  friends, I cannot help but think  that in every death there is a birth:  the spirit leaves the body dead to us,   and passes to the other side of the   vail alive to that great and noble   company that are also working for   the accomplishment of the purposes  of God, in the redemption and salva-  tion of a fallen world. And   the spirit of this our deceased  Sister has gone to mingle with her   little ones who have gone before her,  and with her father and mother and  her other family relations, and with   her many friends who, like her, have   wrestled with life and the struggles   and troubles thereof, have overcome  and gone home. All is well with   Sister Cannon. She is satisfied with   her condition to-day. I feel with  regard to her as I have always felt   with regard to faithful Latter-day   Saints, when they have finished  their work and gone behind the vail,  that there are none of them that  would return to their earthly bodies   if they had the opportunity.    In making remarks at funerals,  which I have often been called upon  to do, I have taken the liberty of   speaking plainly my feelings with   regard to the dead. And I will  say here, when I see a man or a wo-  man, a true and faithful Latter-day  Saint pass away, I do not feel in my  heart to mourn. Why should we   mourn for the woman whose re-  mains lie before us? She has been  true and faithful to the sacred and   holy covenants that she entered in-  to with God her heavenly Father;   she has received those ordinances in  the house of God that will prepare  her to go into the presence of the best  men and women that have lived up-  on the earth; she has left a noble  posterity to bear her name and to   bear record of and to emulate her  example; she is freed from pain and  suffering and the anxieties of life,  and is now beyond the power of the   enemy of all righteousness; she has   opened her eyes in the spirit world,  among her relatives and friends and   her own little ones, whose death   caused her grief and pain; she has  gone to enjoy the society of those   who have washed their robes and   made them white in the  blood of the Lamb, and to in-  herit the blessings and glory of   eternal life. No, I cannot feel to  mourn for her. It is hard, of course,  to part with our friends; but after   all it is with regard to them, as one   of old said. It is better to go to the  house of mourning than the house of   feasting. It is natural for us to give   expression to our feelings in tears  in laying away the bodies of our be-  loved friends, and there is a degree   to which we may go which is proper  and right; but there are extremes   which are often indulged in, which  is neither proper nor right for Lat-  ter day Saints to copy after. Here,  however, as I have said, we have   nothing to mourn about as far as  Sister Cannon is concerned.    When I say that I have never felt  to mourn for any faithful man or  woman who has died in this   Church, I must make one exception;   I did feel to mourn, and so did all  Israel, the death of our martyred   Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and   Hyrum Smith. But we did not   mourn on account of them person-  ally, for they had passed through all   that any martyr ever did or could,   but we felt to mourn their loss   to the Church as our leaders   to whom we had learned to   look for counsel and advice  in every hour of trouble and trial,   although there is something very   dreadful in the thought of assassin-  ating men, whether they be Pro-  phets or Apostles, or whether they   be emperors or presidents. With  that exception I have not felt to  mourn for any faithful person who  has gathered up his feet and gone  to sleep with the fathers. I have   felt rather, that they have gained a   victory which but few of the hu-  man family have gained in their  day and generation. For you will  find, my brethren and sisters, there   there are but a very few compara-  tively, either male or female, who  have had independence of mind  enough, as well as honesty of heart   sufficient to receive the Gospel of  Christ. It takes independence of   mind, honesty of heart, faith in  God, and firmness of character to  live the life of a Latter-day Saint,   in the face of a frowning world, and  in the midst of trials and troubles   and persecution.    The spirit of Sister Cannon has  left us; her body is here awaiting the  purifying changes it must undergo  in mother earth. But whether her  spirit is present witnessing these  funeral services, or whether she, on   opening her eyes in the spirit  world, would say, "I leave  my body for my friends to bury, I   must enter upon my mission," that   is something we are not able to   speak definitely about. God  not having revealed it unto  us. But this we do know, she  is all right, because she was thor-  oughly prepared for the change that  awaited her; and she has gone to do  all that she can for those of her  kindred and friends that are to fol-  low. And what more can you say?   We are left, and we are doing for   Sister Cannon what our friends,   sooner or later, will be doing for us.  It will not be very long before Bro-  ther Cannon and also the children   and friends of the deceased who re-  remain will join her in the spirit-  world, if it is not until the coming  of Christ. This admonition comes   home forcibly to the living, "Be ye   also ready." And it applies to us  all. And it is for us as parents and  Elders of Israel to labor in the  cause of God while we are permitted   to tarry; living up to the light and   knowledge that we have been   blessed with. For there is a time   appointed unto all men; and He  takes away many according to the  counsels of His own will. He takes  whom He will take, and spares   whom he will spare for a wise pur-  pose in Himself. These things are   according to the purposes and ordi-  nation of God to man. Some labor   this side of the vail, others on the   other side of the vail. If we tarry  here we expect to labor in the cause   of salvation, and if we go hence we   expect to continue our work until  the coming of the Son of Man. The   only difference is, while we are here   we are subject to pain and sorrow,   while they on the other side are  free from affliction of every kind.    I pray to God to comfort the heart of   Brother Cannon in this his sad be-  reavement, and to sustain him by  the power of His Spirit; and I pray   that his wives and children may be  blessed and preserved in the truth,  that at last he and they, together  with this his companion, whose  voice is now hushed in death, may  come forth in the morning of the  first resurrection, and stand in their  family organization clothed with  glory, immortality and and eternal  lives, to join with the redeemed and   sanctified in exclaiming:    "O death, where is thy sting? O   grave, where is thy victory?"

 when school began I  was not able to earn money  sufficient to defray all my  expenses and hence was  oblidged to contract an  indebtedness of $70.00.    Aas you are aware  school has discontinued  but a short time and  I have found but little  employment hence you  will readily see first  how matters stand with  me from a financial point  of view. As to my feelings,   I can assure you that  were I able, I would  gladly able accept the  proposed mission, as  my time and talents  are cheerfully laid on  the altar, to be used  wherever and however  Our Father sees fit.    However, if, under these   circumstances, it be the  will of God that I should  take this mission, I am  willing to do so, and will  try to be prepared to leave  home sometime next  fall or whenever you, in  your wisdom see fit   to summon me.    Hoping to hear from  you again at your ear-  liest convienance I beg  to remain    Your Brother    Richard N.
