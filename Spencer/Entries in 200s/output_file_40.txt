He said He was with Joseph & another Man in   the woods praying and Heavens was opened and they saw a  Man sitting upon a Throne whose hair was white as wool & a woman   sitting beside of him Both dressed in white Joseph said it was Adam & Eve     
 March 9, 1884   thought Different from Br Richards. He though[t] in that way a man  Man would not be carrying out the Patriarchal Law of marriage  if that would have answerd he did not see the necessity of the  Lord commanding Joseph the Prophet to take several wifes at  the same time. An Angel of God stood by him with a drawn  sword and told him he should be slain & cut off from the Earth  and the Kingdom of God if he did not obey that Law G Q Cannon  was of the same opinion, that A man must have more than  one wife at a time in order to obey that Law But He said He  beliveved there would be men in the Celestial Kingdom that  had but one wife and some who had no wife and some  who had several wifes would not get there at all for good  Men died without having the Privilege and men would be  Judged according to their desires as well as their acts and  those men who died without the gospel and would have received  it if they had a chance will receive it hereafter & be saved in  the Celestial Kingdom so with those who would have received  the Patriarchal Order of Marriage oif they had a chance  will be saved in the Celestial Kingdom. W Woodruff  agreed with Brother Smith & Cannon in this principle  He spoke of the Temporal Blessings the Lord had poured  out upon those who had Entered into it faithfully At the  close of the Meeting we took cars & rode to S L City 10 m[iles]      March 10, 1884 ~ Monday      10 [FIGURE] I received 3 letters from Malinda Hatch, Sarah, &c  [FIGURES] At the close of the Meeting we ordained 5 High Council  and 2 High Priest W Woodruff was Mouth in ord[aini]ng  one High Priest & one High Council I Attended a Meeting of  the Building Committee and Examined the plan for the Bank

He spoke upon the Marriage in Cana  at Gallilee He thought Jesus was the Bridegroom and Mary & Martha  the brides. He also refered to ##Luke 10:38-42|Luke 10 ch 38 to 42 verse##. Also ##John 11:2, 5|John 11 ch  2 & 5## vers ##John 12:3|John 12 ch 3rd vers##, ##John 20:8-18|John 20 8 to 18##. Joseph Smith spoke   upon these passages to show that Mary & Martha manifested much  closer relationship than Merely A Believer which looks consistent  He did not think that Jesus who decended throug Poligemous   families from Abraham down & who fulfilled all the Law   even baptism by immersion would have lived and died   without being married. Erastus Snow followed for 15   Minuts & told the congregation what Joseph taught   him upon the subject of Plurality of wives W Woodruff  closed by saying He wished the congregation to remember  the discourse of Joseph F Smith but they need not attempt to  preach the same sermon. They might Also remember the   testimony of Erastus Snow. W Woodruff also said That He   felt to indorse the discourse of Joseph F Smith and would  say that the Law of the Patriarchal Order of Marriage belonged  to this dispensiation and After it was revealed to Joseph   Smith the Prophets and He was commanded to receive  it Had He and the People rejected it The Church & Kingdom   of God given into the Hands of the Saints would not have  advanced any further but would have been taken out of their

And the Messengers gave him much valuable   instruction, and told him that the Mormons were their true friends   and that they must listen to their teachings for they were their   Brethren and would do them good and tell them what to do   That they had the History of your fathers forefathers. On one   occasion he was shown a large pile of Records and it was  told him to chuse one Book. He told the Messenger He could  not read but reached over and took one Book, and said He   would chuse that one, the Messenger said that was ^the^ right   one for that was the one that the record of their forefathers  that the Mormons had. At another time He was shown the  Indians & the Mormons and the Devil between them  like a great Big Ox or Bull. He was hoofing pawing and  Bellowing trying to keep the Mormons from the Indians, but   he could not do it, for he saw the Mormons and Indians all  together and all living as one people, he also saw them rise  above their Enemies. It is plain to be seen that there is a good   spirit at work with the Lamanites for when they come around  they show it and it is growing in them.
