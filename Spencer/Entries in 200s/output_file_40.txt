 March 9, 1884 thought Different from Br Richards. He though[t] in that way a manMan would not be carrying out the Patriarchal Law of marriageif that would have answerd he did not see the necessity of theLord commanding Joseph the Prophet to take several wifes atthe same time. An Angel of God stood by him with a drawnsword and told him he should be slain & cut off from the Earthand the Kingdom of God if he did not obey that Law G Q Cannonwas of the same opinion, that A man must have more thanone wife at a time in order to obey that Law But He said Hebeliveved there would be men in the Celestial Kingdom thathad but one wife and some who had no wife and somewho had several wifes would not get there at all for goodMen died without having the Privilege and men would beJudged according to their desires as well as their acts andthose men who died without the gospel and would have receivedit if they had a chance will receive it hereafter & be saved inthe Celestial Kingdom so with those who would have receivedthe Patriarchal Order of Marriage oif they had a chancewill be saved in the Celestial Kingdom.

Joseph Smith spoke upon these passages to show that Mary & Martha manifested muchcloser relationship than Merely A Believer which looks consistentHe did not think that Jesus who decended throug Poligemous families from Abraham down & who fulfilled all the Law even baptism by immersion would have lived and died without being married. Erastus Snow followed for 15 Minuts & told the congregation what Joseph taught him upon the subject of Plurality of wives W Woodruffclosed by saying He wished the congregation to rememberthe discourse of Joseph F Smith but they need not attempt topreach the same sermon.
