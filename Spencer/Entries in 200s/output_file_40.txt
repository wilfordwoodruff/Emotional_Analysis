Dear brother:  Not long since I received a call to labor in the missionary field in California and to leave in January  next. I assented most gladly. Since that time, however, conditions (financial) have undergone a change and I feel that an extension of time would prove a great accommodation to me. I would not consent to a release under any conditions. From present indication I can arrange to leave in one year from the present time quite conveniently. We are without a home— or any other property and it is necessary for me to make provision not only for myself but also for my wife during my absence.  It will be a pleasure for me to go to any part of the world I may be directed to go to. However, if I should exercise a choice I should suggest Great Britain or Germany, with a preference for the latter.  If there is any place where my wife could assist in the work she could, accompany me with very little  more expense than by remaining home.

Believing that the unanimous voice and request of the permanent male citizens of this Territory, without distinc tion of political or religious parties, will receive due consideration in the mind of the National Executive before he shall confer appointments for Territorial officers for Utah, We beg leave to submit the following names, viz: Hon: Orson Hyde for Associate Jus- tice. These names, be assured honored Sir, have long been known by the entire mass of this people, and represent men whose integrity, patriotism, and loyalty to the United States have hitherto been untarnished by the breath of suspicion among the citizens of Utah.  Their legal qualifications are ample to subserve the ends of justice, and the provisions of the Constitution of the  United States; and their appointment will promote confidence and give entire satisfaction to this whole people, as the following signatures indicate: and, also, perpetuate the most amicable relations with all the members of the National Confederacy by their affable and liberal bearing to all men without culpable affection or favor.  It is conceived that their being permanent residents among us, will obviate the recurrence of such difficulties as might arise from sudden removals or resignation, which have recently occasioned so much excitement and evil surmisings in our nation. Should these men meet with your approbation and that of the Senate, and be appointed to the offices designated for our infant Territory, be assured, a great hearted, patriotic, loyal, and industrious peo- ple, as they ever have done, will continue to pray.

TO THE FEMALE RELIEF SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT  UTAH TERRITORY:  LADIES: The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, at a meeting of its Board of Directors on the 10th day of August inst.,  recognizing the fact that heretofore the ladies have contributed in a   liberal manner to their department, until it has become one of the  leading features of our exhibitions, ordered that a circular be written  calling upon all the Relief Societies to unite, and by a concentration of  effort, accomplish that which will be highly creditable and be parallel  with Utah's advanced growth.  Exhibitions of Domestic Products and Manufactures are con-  sidered of such utility and importance that they form a prominent part  of the civil policy of the nations; and the people who foster and excel in their products and industries lay the foundation of commercial  independence.  A people situated as we are, so remote from other manufacturing  districts, aided by the heavy tariffs of transportation, have every  stimulus to encourage them in this direction. The adoption of this  policy is pregnant with benefits on every hand. While attaining the  desirable status of having "the beauty of our apparel the workmanship  of our own hands," the laudable condition is also reached of furnishing  employment for the heavy tide of immigrants coming westward and  for the legion of youth growing up in our midst.  A word to the wise is sufficient: Ladies, you are respectfully  invited to contribute and to take an active part in rendering this  exhibition a step in advance of its predecessors.  W.
