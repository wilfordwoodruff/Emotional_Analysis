I wastold to start from Salt Lake City on Feb the 7th.I answered the Letter and said I would go but atthe same time stated my Circumstances upon whichI was honorably released. But Brother Wm. Budgetold me that my Name would still be kept on theMissionary List and I should prepar myself to goas soon as I would be called gagain.Now I have done so and I am now better preparedthan I was a year ago. My Familie is where I wouldlike to leave them while I would be away on my Missionhere in Garden City where they can attend Meettings andSunday Schools although my Property is very Little and no wheresnear to supply there wants, but with the help of the Lordand oure good Bishop they would get along allright.I can pay my debts allright but will have not muchto spare unless I could sell some Horses of which I havethree and good one's, and would rather not sell them.Now what I would like to know is this: I wouldlike to go to the Colonies of Mexico in order to leave ^live^in Peace surounded by all of my Familie of which I havebeen moore or less deprived in the last three years or more.I aslso think it is fully as good a Country to make aLiving in or leave a Familie while gone abroad.
