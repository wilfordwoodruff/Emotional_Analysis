Just before the close of  our last legislature I was informed by Bro Booth  that I was ecpected to call at your office at my  earliest convenience and consult in relation to   contemplated mission I did so if you remember  a few days before the session closed and you said  something about deferring the matter until we  had more leisure. As I have heard nothing  I have been wondering lately if it was expected I  would call at this office. At this time I supposed  when you desired I would be notified and then  I could call without interupting other business    My only object in writing is to inform you  that I am at any time subject to your wishes  in that regard I injured my eyes seriously last  Spring So that I am contemplating possibly a  trip to New York or London for treatment and I  feel if I do go out into the world it would please  me to put myself in a position to do as much  good as I can as a latter day Saint. I trust

Dear Brother:    Will you please send me the permits  for passage over the Railroad, I think from  Chester, San Pete Co. as we will have to  go to the Temple to get our endowments.  I wish you would send both mine and   elder George Munford's, as he requested me   to ask for his with mine.    Bro. George Eyer, of Parowan,  who has been called, was informed in his  letter which he received last Monday, giving   him a change of field, to Great Britain,  that the elders would leave for that field  on the 26th. of Nov.  Is this correct? or has   he been misinformed?  If it is correct  why have we not been notified of the change?  as it would greatly interfere with our   calulations, if the change should be made  without us knowing it, as we have been  notified that the 12 12th is the day of de-  parture.    Please inform us if this is correct,   letting us know what day we are expected to   leave Salt Lake City, and ans. as soon as  possible as we expect to leave, here on the 3rd.

Dier Brother    Last January I was called to  go on a Mission to Swztzerland and Germany. I was  told to start from Salt Lake City on Feb the 7th.    I answered the Letter and said I would go but at  the same time stated my Circumstances upon which  I was honorably released. But Brother Wm. Budge  told me that my Name would still be kept on the  Missionary List and I should prepar myself to go  as soon as I would be called gagain.    Now I have done so and I am now better prepared  than I was a year ago. My Familie is where I would  like to leave them while I would be away on my Mission  here in Garden City where they can attend Meettings and  Sunday Schools although my Property is very Little and no wheres  near to supply there wants, but with the help of the Lord  and oure good Bishop they would get along allright.    I can pay my debts allright but will have not much  to spare unless I could sell some Horses of which I have  three and good one's, and would rather not sell them.    Now what I would like to know is this: I would  like to go to the Colonies of Mexico in order to leave ^live^  in Peace surounded by all of my Familie of which I have  been moore or less deprived in the last three years or more.  I aslso think it is fully as good a Country to make a  Living in or leave a Familie while gone abroad.

As you wish to know my feelings  in regard to this matter I will state them in as few  words as I possiablly can.    My circumstances and condition are not as favorable  at this time as I could wish. For a number  of years past I have been trying to give my  children (that is those who are old enough) as good  an education as my limited means would afford.  Beleaving it to be the duty of every parent to look  well to the training of their children and to see that  they have all the advantages of a good and true  education, so that they can become useful and  powerful in defending the cause of Zion both  religiously and politically, so that they would be  equal to any foe who should assail his rights.

 and not being a man of means it took every  dollar we could get to pay for them, so much  so that we had to deprive ourselves in  some instances, but we were determining   by the help of our Heavenly Father to keep  them there and we did so.

I was notified yesterday by   Elder Reynolds that I was wanted for a  mission to England, and was also requested  to write you of my feelings and situation.    A call from the presiding priesthood  to any duty is to me one of the most power-  ful of earthly things, and I therefore say   that where they wish me to go, I shall be  ready. As to my situation, and by that  term I mean my business situation, it  is at present a very poor one for a protracted  and expensive absence. Like most others  in my line of business my obligations are   considerable, and if my presence in my   field of labor is not immediately required  and there could be time given to put my  affairs in leavable shape it would  save me considerable sacrifice.

Decbr 13th 1890    President Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother!    On the 28th of Novbr I received   a Notice, stating that my Name hade been  presented for a Mision to scandinavia, and  asked for my feeling and circumstances  regarding such a Mision.    First I desire to say: In youth  I received the Gospel (I were then studying   Physiology and prepairing for a College Aducation)    In the fall of 1855 I received my first   call as a Misionair in my native Country  which continued till spring 1862, when   I emigrated and arrived in Salt Lake City  in Septbr the same year. I then moved  to Gunnison sanpete County and helped  to build up the place and protect the   people from Indian depredation.    In 1871 and 1872 I respounded to a Mision  with Canute Peterson (now presiding over  Sanpete Stake) to scandinavia, after  my return I moved to Manti where   I hade the great previlege of working   on the Temple ontill the increase of   practices as a Physician and by advice 
 that i might be able to leave  some suport for my famly and  go. But it do^se^ not seam posable  to sell anaything at present  at least in so short a time.    So i have though that probly you  would leive me stay untell next  fall and posable with the Blissing  of the Lord i will be able to fill my  Mission as i wont be at rest untell it  is filled. But you have my curcumstances  as near as i can tell, and if you think  i had better go say so and i will  go, and leave the rest in the  hands of the Lord.    Your Brother  In the Gospel    Wm Willison    Carl. J. Cannon  Bp.    I would give  him the time  he desires, & let him report when  ready. J. F. S. see over.

 Grinnell, Iowa, Nov, 30th 1890.  Elders of the Church of Christ,    Dear Sirs: You do not know me,  but I am trying to learn about the  Morman Church. I used to read the St.  Herald. I am twenty six years of age. Is it  possible for me to get a license to preach  the Mormon doctrine?  I will tell you how  the case stands with me. For several years  I have been studying Swedenborg's revelations.  I determined to become a New Church  preacher.  I intended to enter the Theological  School at Cambridge. I held a long cor-  respondence with the Doctors of the New  Church: they sent me 350 questions to  answer. I did so, and they said that they were   answered all right. But I was not admitted 
 These are matters, however, which I leave  entirely in your hands, as I know what  you do will be for the best.    Awaiting your pleasure and decision  I have the honor to subscribe myself    Your brother in the Gospel  Brigham. S. Young 
 under the circumstances I think  you had better wire either way  as it takes under favourable  circumstances thirteen days  to get a letter from here to you  and an answer back    Yours as Ever  Chas.

Salt Lake City, Utah, Decr 19 1890    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother: I recevd a letter this evening  from the Publishers of Chambers New Edition of  their Encyclopedia. Messrs J. B. Lippincolt Co of  Philadelphia, stating that on November 26th  the manager of the work sent to President Richards  to return proof of the article on the Mormons,  as early as possible. but, as yet it seems it  has not been attended to. This is I think impor-  tant, as the manager swrites me he fear that  if longer delayed corrections if there be any  will be too late for insertion.    Kindly have this matter attended to, and  Oblige    Very Respectfully  Your Bro &c.    James Dwyer
