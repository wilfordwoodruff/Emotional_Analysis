April 7 In the afternoon President Brigham Young spoke to the people in the spirit &amp; power of God upon Principle He spoke upon the subject of the Patriarchal Marriage He said if a man took more than one FIGURE wife upon the principle of passion instead of principle it will prove  a curse instead of a Blessing if a woman is sealed to a good man  she should be satisfied &amp; attend to her own business &amp; let her husband  alone &amp; not be watching him all the time. Women are sealed to men to bring forth children &amp; not to gratify passion &amp; much was said upon this subject when he closed, He called upon Capt Jefferson Hunt to  speak He made a good deal of music for the people. I met with the all the Presidency &amp; L Snow &amp; W Woodruff of the Twelve in the Prayer Circle. L. Snow Prayed &amp; G A Smith was Mouth at  the close of Prayers Joseph A.

Smiths House Before leaving the circle room President Young said I want to say a few words to Brother  Orson Hyde At the opening of this general Conference I was there one minute before the time, &amp; Brother Hyde had opened the Conference  had prayers &amp; singing &amp; I must say I was mortified I am the president of the whole Church &amp; it is my place to preside at a general  Conference. did you ever know me to step foreward in the days of Joseph &amp; take his place &amp; open a General Conference without he directed me  to do it, or did you ever know me interfere with the rights of any  man No you have not. I should have waited an hour after the  time before I should have opened the Conference but Brother Hyde opened it before the time &amp; he has served me the same several  times and I dont want to see it any more. Elder Orson H said it never Entered my heart that I was doing wrong several who were president present said it was 10 oclok &amp; asked me to open the Conference  &amp; I ownly done it to open the way for you. Brother George asked me this Noon to open the Conference &amp; I told him No for I had heard that  you was not pleased about it G A Smith said I did ask him &amp; it  did not Enter into my heart but what all was right. Brother Hyde  said He would remember it for the future, I do not think any one of the Twelve thought of it. President Young said Now I will   ENDENTRY April 7, 1861 ask all of you, how would you feel if you had a work to do which God &amp; the heavens held you responsible for &amp; just as you was about to step forth to do it another man should rise up &amp; take it out of your hands Before the people as though you was not qualifyed to Do it  lecting your duty you would not like it you would feel  and so did I. Now we can see by this how easy it is for a man  to walk into a mud hole when they think they are walking on solid ground then let us all profit by this example &amp; be careful that we do not  interfere with the rights of others.

The South are better prepaired &amp; much  faster than the North are. Lincoln has taken a course to rather  keep the North back.

Still I like to see such things got up Joseph would tell more in one hour about Geneology than the world can in a year. He was particular about such things much more so than I am but I expect He will be with  us. I expect if I live to be 80 years old I am in hops to have  some of the wisdom that Moses Had.

I wish to give a word of council to the people I shall not give any to the Bishop but I wish to say to the people dont you send  your children to go to school in this basement story it is not Healthy   ing the drivings of this people I do not believe that you can  go into any city in the world &amp; pick up 100 children promiscusly   ENDENTRY 1861 and put them by the side of our children that are as well educated  as the same number of our children gathered up promiscusly in the Territory of Utah. There are some people &amp; countries who force  &amp; whip their children into an Education but we should never  croud &amp; force the minds of our children beyoung what they are able to bear if we do we ruin them for life. I would rather my children would spend their Early life sliding down Hill, skating, riding Horses  till they were 20 years old &amp; not go to school one day than to clog  &amp; force the mind while young with intricate studies it strains &amp; cripples the mind for life &amp; ruins the man, you never see a child that is confin- ed while young to close rooms &amp; hard study &amp; followed up to manhood that ever becomes a master spirit or qualifyed to transact difficult  business in after life. I do not think there is a man upon the face of  the whole Earth that has as great a complicated variety of subjects  &amp; things to attend to to weigh upon the mind as I have, at the same time, I do not think there is a man upon Earth who can accomplish  as much business in an hour, day, month, or year, with as much Ease  and as little trouble as I do. But should I do as most people do it would  soon ruin me. But I thoroughly train my mind so that I permit  nothing to trouble me upon the Earth. I strive to do my duty in all things  upon the Earth then leave the Event with the Lord when any subject or  thing comes before me I train my mind in such away that I can bring  the whole force &amp; strength of my mind to bear upon it and I keep it there untill I have done with the subject I comprehend every truth there is connected with the subject necess ment of whatever business is before me, &amp; as soon as the business is done I train my mind to instantly forget it &amp; cast it away &amp; should  never think of it again unless some circumstance should transpire  necessary to call it up. I am now at the dedication of this Hall  my mind is here when I get through &amp; go away I may never  think of this meeting again unless some person should call it to  my mind. when I have been crouded with business through the day  &amp; I go to my bed to rest though I may not be any more sleepy than  I am now, the moment I lie down I throw evry thing out of my mind untill it is like a peace of white blank paper I neither care for nothing  nor know nothing &amp; in one minute I am asleep my wife has spoken   ENDENTRY Jan 1 to me many times in one minute after I have lain down &amp; awaik me up.

I laid hands Upon Brother Ross oldest  sible through the night Wilford returned home to night bringing ten head of cattle with him    ENDENTRY January 31, 1861 ~ Thursday    FIGURE Young preached a short discourse on the occasion No reporter the following is a synopsis of what he said   come Brother Little would wish me to speak and I thought I should want much of the spirit of the Lord to assist me to overcome my weakness to which  I am subject on occasions like this. At times I can overcome it. The question  has often been asked how is it with little children will they grow or not  after death Joseph once said they would, &amp; then He said they would not He never had any revelation upon the subject. And I have no doctrin   ENDENTRY 31 Jan  to give upon the subject. I Believe in the great variety in the vast creations of God. I do not Believe that the Lord ever made two worlds alike or things alike in any world, I do not believe that the Human family have been alike in stature in the various ages of this world. The Lord has power  to give a soul or spirit as m as in a gient 8 or 10 feet high as we find Evidences that in some ages of  this world men have lived to that hight. My doctrin or belief is that we shall find all children &amp; People at the resurrection as they lie down with the same stature, that is the way I want to receive my children if I bury a child that is two years old, I dont want him or her to come to me in a tabernacle 80 or 100 years old or at any other age ownly the age it left me and that is the way I believe it will be. We shall see there spirits before we see there bodies. Whare shall we go to find them in the spirit world but whare is that right here on the Earth whare they lived &amp; whare we live. I have desired to see the spirit of a Friend &amp; to convers with it as I would with you, but I have never yet had this privilege I want to know how they live in the spirit world what for a place they have as I would come &amp; look at Brother Littles House. But I believe all spirits live here after Death and no whare Els, at least those who have taberna- cled in the flesh on the Earth, whether they be good or bad, Satan has no power over those who have overcome him in the flesh after they are dead but he has power over those who all their lives have been subject to him in the flesh. I will now ask how does any one present know what I say my words have a shape to them as much as this chair and the shape of my words go to the drum of your Ear so that you get an understanding of what I  say Now in speaking in the Tabernacle if I turn to the north the shape  of my words strike the drum of the Ear &amp; they understand it perfectly the words strike the wall break the shape to peaces &amp; the sound strikes the Ear of those in the South as much as in the North but they do not understand what is said. Now if I had force of Lungs &amp; power to throw the shape of my words to China they would understand what I say  as well as you do in the further part of this room they would hear it as well. You know when you have a vision you can see as well all over  your Body as out of your Eye. When Joseph had a revelation he had the Eyes of the Lord He saw as the Lord sees how did I know what was going on in Washington. I have known what was going on there all the time   ENDENTRY 31 And I know what is going on in other peoples Houses, I know it by the spirit of God it is revealed to me. Do spirits administer to us they do but we do not know it. Charles here will administer to  his mother but she will not know it. these things are so ordered and governed that we may be tried and if Sister Little was to die &amp; go whare her children are in the spirit world she would do just so, she would not administered to her friends openly for she would see that it was for a wise purpose that there was a veil between the living &amp; the dead that the living might be tryed and have a greater glory, the living cannot see the departed spirits but the departed spirits can see the living and administer to them while they know it not. We are all in the spirit world &amp; in Eternity but we know it not &amp; do not comprehend it. My  wife awoke in the morning that Charles died &amp; said to me I think Charles Little is dead for I have seen him to night with Joseph in a dream and if Brother &amp; Sister Little could see what I have they would not wish him back. He was vary happy with Joseph and Joseph said he wanted him he had a particular place for him, and He looked glorious. Many questions have arises in relation to the death of children. Some have thought that it was ordained that children should die. But this is not true doctrin it is not ordained of God that children should die, but it is the will of God that all children should live and  grow up to manhood &amp; fill up the measure of there days if they could do it and overcome the evils they have to meet with in life but they meet with so much of the Law of Death &amp; so many Evils that many die in childhood &amp; at all ages. you may ask why should not they have a chance to prove themselves as well as we. As I said before there is a great variety the Human family die at all ages &amp; children  that die  are capable of being, will they have another probation or chance  of being tried as we  subject but it is a doctrin I shall say nothing about. we should be satisfyed with the principle that our children will be  restored to us again in their glorifyed bodies with the same  stature that they were taken from us, and they will admin- ister to us though we know it not it is hid from us for a wise purpose   ENDENTRY 31 To give you a figure I will say to a man for instance if you will  go to Big Cotton wood Blindfolded I will give you a reward of Ten thousand dollars but you cannot have it if you go with your Eyes open to see the road, the man starts Blind folded fearing &amp; trembling lest he shall run a foul of wild cattle, into ditches, &amp; difficulties, yet he gropes his way &amp; gets through claims his reward &amp; gets it so in the dealings of the Lord with us He does not let us see every thing in the future before us but makes us promises &amp; makes us walk by faith that we may obtain them and the greater our trials &amp; conquests  the greater will be our crown &amp; glory. So all those who have been tried &amp; got through do not wish to administer to us in that way  that they will make it any lighter for us than it has been for them that all may be tried alike as far as is consistent with the Economy of God    to the office &amp; made this report    ENDENTRY February 1, 1861 ~ Friday    FIGURE The Poney Express came in brought news up to 22nd Jan, 6 states had seceded, the Express when copied off made 22 pages.

A High Council was appointed at the close of the afternoon  service by the unanimous vote of the people. At Early candle light we  met in the vestry of the Tabernacle to ordain the High Council many  of the Priesthood were present Brother Taylor myself &amp; Brother Farr ordained  the 12 men a High Council in that Stake of Zion. We ordained 6 of them  High Priests who were seventies I was informed that a list of names   ENDENTRY  was presented to President Young to pick out the High Council &amp; He named six of them &amp; Brother Farr nominated the other six after they were ordained the power of God rested upon me &amp; I spoke to them about half  an hour upon the subjet of the Priesthood &amp; the magnifying of that Priesthood and meeting all responsibilities required at  power of God that was present I exhorted them to temperance &amp; every good word &amp; work which would exhalt them before God. Elder Taylor followed &amp; made some good remarks.

We had a large assembly of  saints from other Places. Bishop Cook came in &amp; opened the way by singing  &amp; Prayer I then called upon Bishop Richard Cook to speak and  requested him to tell us his feelings if he believed in Joseph Morris as  a Prophet to tell us so, &amp; to tell us what his feelings were in relation to the Presidency of the Church. He arose &amp; spoke some time without touching the  subject. I again requested him to come to the point He then "said "yes I do  Believe in  to lead this Church &amp; Kingdom agreeable to the Revelation in the  Doctrins &amp; Covenants which says I will raise up unto you a Prophet like unto Brigham Young is a prophet  or has ever had any revelation or inspiration more than any sectari- an Priest, &amp; I believe this Church will ownly be known in name in  10 years unless God does raise up a Prophet." When he closed several  of his party got up &amp; Bore the same testimony we then sent for there  fals Prophet &amp; called upon him to speak, he spoke about half an hour He  said Brigham Young was not a prophet &amp; Joseph Smith did not hold the  Keys of the Priesthood &amp; was ordained of man while He Joseph Morris was  ordained of the Father, &amp; held six times more keys of the Priesthood than  Joseph did He said he was the  Presented before the Assembly, when He got through Elder Taylor spoke  to the Assembly &amp; showed  testimony that Brigham Young was a prophet of God &amp; he said that He him- self was more of a Prophet than Morris was. Brigham Young in saying   ENDENTRY  that Joseph  Smith was, was speaking of men being born Natural Prophets &amp; Seers  many have the gift of seeing through seer stones without the Priesthood  at all He had not this gift naturally yet He was an Apostle &amp; the  President of the Church &amp; Kingdom of God on the Earth and all the Keys of the Holy Priesthood &amp; of Revelation was sealed upon him &amp; the   I spoke to the people &amp; bore testimony to the truth of what Elder Taylor  had said. Morris had been cut off from the Church twice for  Adultery in the Territory And He had spent about one year with a woman whose husband was crazy. I told morris that He was not  a Prophet of God Neither was He the seventh Angels that when the 7 mission with a woman whose Husband was crazy &amp; commit Adultery  with Her. I showed the folly of Richard Cook &amp; others following such a  man. When I closed my remarks Morris Denyed of Being with  that woman. Bishop West arose &amp; bore testimony that what I  had said was true. We then took all the Names of the persons  who professed to believe raised up to lead the Church. there was 16 Names Given as follows Richard Cook Hannah Cook  Margaret Cook  Hellen Cook  John Taylor then moved that those sixteen named persons be  cut off from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

It matters not to me  whether the lash hits me or you in the reproofs given by President Young, I feel to thank God that we are blessed with a leader who has  will of God let it reprove or  rebuke who it may. He asks no odds of any kingdom, Nation person or thing who stands in the way of his doing his duty. It is a Blessing to us that we have a leader who have Eyes to see for us when we are in danger ourselves and if we had not some one to warn us and reprove us when we do wrong we would not be safe. President Young is sustained  by the power of God and when he calls upon us to do any thing we ought to do it, and if we withhold we do it to our hurt. the Elders in England have beged of the people, untill they have bound them in chanes and kept them there in poverty if the Elders had pursued a wise course there are thousands who are now in England who would this day have been in Zion, then let us go to &amp; fit out the missionaries and stop there begging from the poor.

I want to live to do my work for If we leave our work to be done by somebody  els to do it will be a long time before it is done Like an Elder going on a mission leaves work to be done By some one Els it is undone.   there has been Nothing said that I want to say, when my Friends die I want to speak of them If I was to say which of my sisters is the best I coold not tell, the last is gone, and the Brothers have got to follow  but I dont know who will go first. But if I was to make a choice &amp;  chuse the one that has done the least good in the world or the one that was still likely to do the least good on the Earth it would be myself. I would like to go to the spirit world &amp; be with my sisters I dont expect to do much good in this life yet I feel that I have done about the best I could.

If the children of men  was in possession of the truth concerning Eternal things they would  not cling to life as they do. you know my feelings about mans  sin in all the imprisionment and suffering and I feel that I have greater re that is because I am more righteous than other men But I have  greater reason to rejoice than other men in this thing.

I dont care how rough my life may be if I do the best I can. I was with Nancy a good deal and her  last words were Hosannah glory to God she wanted to say more but her speech failed. I do not wish to say much let us do good and shun Evil that we may not bring sorrow upon ourselves.
